  <section class="page js-page"><h1>New job in the new year</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  In connection with the latest developments in the banking industry (and not only there), I decided to share my conclusions based on my own job search experience in the outgoing year.  It is unlikely that I will reveal some ominous secrets here, but while I was looking for a job, I didn‚Äôt see so many sensible articles on the topic ‚Äúwhat is the essence of job search.‚Äù  I hope that this article will be useful to those who have to start the new year with a job search. <br>  UPD: this article seems to upset some people, and therefore a small disclaimer (just to avoid disappointment): <i>this article is not intended for highly qualified professionals who have several offers from leading companies in the world.</i>  <i>The article is addressed primarily to those who do not know how to sell themselves, like its author.</i> <br><br>  So you are looking for a job.  Most likely, this process began for you (as well as for the author at the time) suddenly, for reasons beyond your control (reduction, dismissal, liquidation of a company, etc.). <br>  The first thing you need to understand, and not even understand, but to get into it (and, preferably, in the sense of Heinlein's ‚Äúthunder‚Äù *): you sell goods in a highly competitive market.  This is what you actually do.  The product is you, along with your knowledge, experience, habits, character, appearance, speech, and everything else.  Everything plays a role.  Different components of the candidate have different priorities, but with equal priority components each trifle will play a role.  Remember: you are a seller, employers are buyers.  We are all modest people, no one, unfortunately, taught us to trade (and often even suggested that trade is almost the lot of the lower caste), so there will have to overcome some breaking of stereotypes and patterns. <br>  If you are "rocked", then everything follows is absolutely logical. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  <i>1. Summary.</i> <br>  Write as complete a summary as possible.  Cover your experience in the last 10 years (or better - directly from the university, even if after graduation 20 years have passed).  <b>Your resume is the packaging of your product</b> .  But do not write "War and Peace."  Need specifics.  At each position there should be 2 sections: Responsibilities and Achievements.  Write down in the Duties all that you did.  In Achievements write down everything you have achieved.  There is no work without achievements.  Do not write the words "took part in," write "did this and that within the framework of this and that."  Do not be shy.  But do not write about what you can not tell.  If you are friends with English - be sure to make an English version of the resume. <br>  UPD: The comments suggested, but I somehow missed it (apparently, for obvious reasons): the summary should not contain grammatical and spelling errors.  Resumes with errors are sent to the trash immediately. 
      <br>
        <script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>
        <ins class="adsbygoogle"
          style="display:block; text-align:center;"
          data-ad-layout="in-article"
          data-ad-format="fluid"
          data-ad-client="ca-pub-6974184241884155"
          data-ad-slot="8945601208"></ins>

          (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
        </script>
      <br>
      <i>2. Cover letter.</i> <br>  Some employers require a letter that briefly describes you.  Make it based on the summary.  The letter should fit into A4, so include only the most basic points. <br><br>  <i>3. Social networks and sites</i> . <br>  <b>This is an advertisement for your product</b> .  Make it so that more people know about your job search.  Create your website and upload your resume there, create accounts on LinkedIn and HeadHunter (again based on your resume), tell all your friends on Twitter, Facebook, VKontakte, Odnoklassniki, Learn, etc.  about what you are looking for work, give links to your pages with a summary.  Should I use job search sites in the RF, other than HH.RU?  It's your business, but, in my experience, there is no use for them.  All serious and good employers use HH.RU or serious recruitment agencies, which also regularly go to HH.RU. <br>  UPD: the website rabota.ru is also mentioned in the comments, through which the commentator found a job, so I think this should be regarded as a recommendation. <br><br>  <i>4. HeadHunter.</i> <br>  <b>You put your goods on the counter in the Main Kolkhoz Market of the Country</b> .  I think most of us can and do not want to work in any one particular position, there is always a certain list of preferences.  Someone has it more, someone has less, but almost everyone has it.  For each desired position, edit your resume (this is especially important for those who have non-linear work experience, that is, for those who have experience like, for example, developer: sysadmin - tester - pyem), highlighting and strengthening the places characteristic of the desired position , and weakening or even completely removing all unnecessary.  Auto-search for each desired position and regularly review all the new things that appear.  Respond to all that fit.  Regularly update your resumes (manually 2-3 times a day) so that they are constantly visible. <br><br>  <i>5. You are invited to an interview</i> . <br>  <b>The buyer went to the counter.</b>  <b>Smile and wave</b> .  This is usually a call from HR, but maybe an e-mail.  Talk calmly and kindly.  Agree on the time and place of the meeting.  Ask to send the scheme, date and time to your e-mail.  Usually, by the way, HRs themselves offer this, this is common practice.  Be sure to respond to the sent letter with confirmation of the meeting.  Even if you did not ask for it, it will be appreciated.  Add an appointment to the calendar on your phone.  By the way, if at this stage there is some laxity or inaccuracy on the part of HR, then this is an alarm bell. <br><br>  <i>6. Interview.</i> <br>  <b>The buyer turns the goods in his hands and thinks whether to buy or not to buy.</b>  <b>Asks the price, sniffs, tastes the tooth</b> .  I recommend that you go for an interview in calm clothes.  A suit with a tie and shoes is rarely needed, and it is usually reported about this specifically during the coordination of the meeting.  But there shouldn't be anything in you that can scare away the buyer.  You must show that your product is not explosive and non-toxic.  This is trivial, but you should not smell much and even more stink (with socks, sweat, etc.).  You should not shine before cutting eyes and shine colors.  The shoes must be clean (I recommend men to remember ‚ÄúMoscow doesn‚Äôt believe in tears‚Äù, the scene in the train).  Get out of the house with a half-hour supply.  It is better to sit 15 minutes in the lobby and take a break than run from the subway, headlong.  At the interview, hold with dignity.  Tell about yourself calmly and confidently.  Carefully look at the situation, to the people.  You might not like something right now.  Ask questions, do not hesitate, but think about any question.  Remember: you have one piece of goods, and you choose the buyer yourself.  It is not necessary to sell your beauty to the first person.  In the words of a cartoon character: "Fools, come on, a lot, but there are not many hares, come on."  Interview rarely takes place in one stage.  Get ready for 2-3-4 stages.  This is especially true if those who take on labor are leased to other organizations that do not want to recruit specialists for themselves: offices like Epam or Luxoft. <br><br>  <i>7. In readiness for oblomu - our strength.</i> <br>  Be prepared for the fact that you will be denied the first interview.  And on the second.  And on the third and fourth.  And at the last of the 3 steps of the 5th interview.  The reasons you almost never call anyone.  By the way, no one bans you asking about them.  Call and ask, you have every right to do this: you spent your time, after all, but it costs money.  And your nerves.  Dont be upset.  Draw conclusions, change tactics of behavior.  In 2013, the search period for a job (without the help of relatives and friends) was around 5 months.  But many found and faster.  And remember: summer is the low season.  In the period from the second decade of June to mid-August, almost all recruitment activities cease. <br><br>  <i>8. Keep yourself in hand.</i> <br>  You will meet very different people.  There are louts.  I do not recommend to be rude in the answer, answer calmly.  But after the interview, answer yourself the question if you want to work in this company.  There are psychologists.  In one company (medium system integrator), I was first asked to fill out questionnaires with questions like "how long have you stopped drinking brandy in the morning?".  At the same time, the HR psychologist girl allowed herself to be half an hour late.  Our conversation, of course, did not take place. <br><br>  <i>9. Look for a place where you will be comfortable.</i> <br>  First of all it concerns people.  Listen to yourself.  In the end, you <i>live</i> with these people. <br><br>  <i>10. Do not give up chances.</i> <br>  Even if you have a suggestion in your hands, do not reject new interviews.  Until you have signed the contract, you owe nothing to anyone. <br><br>  I hope my observations and advice will help you.  I wish you in the new year to find an excellent job! <br><br>  ___________________________________ <br>  <i>* Groc, roar (Mars., Fant., Heinl.)</i> - understand so fully that the observer becomes part of the observed (C) R.
