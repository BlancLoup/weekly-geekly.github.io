  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Electric vehicle power consumption data is being underestimated by manufacturers.</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  A two-year study of the Institute of Transport of the Technical University of Denmark ( <i>Danmarks Tekniske Universitet</i> ) showed that the electric power consumption of electric vehicles when moving higher than that claimed by manufacturers by almost 50%. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  The study, entitled ‚ÄúHarnessing Big Data for Estimating the Energy Consumption and Driving Range of Electric Vehicles‚Äù (‚Äú <i>Using Big Data to determine energy consumption and power reserve of electric vehicles</i> ‚Äù), had a broad coverage: 741 drivers tested more than two years for 200 cars of the brands Citro√´n C-Zero, Mitsubishi i-MiEV and Peugeot iOn on the roads of Denmark.  Each car was transferred to the use of the inhabitants of Denmark for a period of three to six months.  Then jointly analyzed the GPS data and power consumption during charging. <br><br>  The results showed instead of the claimed consumption of 125 Wh / km by manufacturers, the real consumption of 183 Wh / km.  These data were obtained from the results of travel a little more than 2.3 million km.  The excess was 46.4%. <br><br>  According to one of the engineers who conducted the tests: ‚ÄúA Citro√´n C-Zero battery capacity of 16 kWh means an average range of 87 km.  This is much less than the 130 or 150 km declared by the manufacturer, which is achieved under the terms of the new European driving cycle. ‚Äù  ( <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_European_Driving_Cycle">New European Riding Cycle on Wikipedia</a> )

      Thus, there is a significant difference between the actual and the declared characteristics, as in the case of cars with internal combustion engines.  Only a quarter of the trips showed an expense below or at the level of the stated 125 Wh / km.  On other trips, the flow rate was naturally higher, sometimes significantly (on some trips it reached 400 Wh / km). <br><br>  During the study, important results were also obtained for planning trips to cities and purchases of electric vehicles.  The preferred leisurely movement on an electric vehicle at a speed of 30 km / h was not optimal in terms of power reserve.  The greatest stock and, therefore, the most economical mode was driving at an average speed of 52 km / h.  It is also important - when the speed drops below 30 km / h, the energy consumption per kilometer of the path increases exponentially. <br>  In contrast to cars with ICE, the increase in consumption at a speed is relatively small.  Thus, consumption at an average speed of 25 km / h is identical to consumption at 100 km / h [ <i>here, ‚Äúconsumption‚Äù means ECR - energy consumption rate</i> - idiv]. <br><br>  For drivers, the following is important - slower does not mean more economical and more.  This is an important moment for those responsible for planning the development of cities, who, if they wish to reduce CO2 emissions in city centers, advocate a speed of no more than 30 km / h in the same centers. <br><br>  Another result of the study was, according to Carlo Prato from the Institute of Transport: ‚ÄúPeople want to charge a car, although at least half of the charge remains.  This definitely indicates the fear of being on the road without charge. ‚Äù <br><br>  On average, each driver made 3.4 trips per day, almost half of which were shorter than 5 km [ <i>this value, according to the authors of the study, is caused by the small size of the Danish communities and mistrust of electric vehicles</i> -idiv].  Only one percent of the trips were longer than 50 km.  Temperature also played an important role: in the warm season, the average consumption was 168 Wh / km, in the cold season - 225 Wh / km (almost a third higher).  According to the tests, the smallest consumption was reached at a temperature of 14 ¬∞ C. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/390361/">https://habr.com/ru/post/390361/</a></p>
