  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Integration with YClients: combining online recording and IP telephony</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Cloud services allow companies to completely get rid of their own IT infrastructure, not only hardware or software, but also from setting up the services themselves.  Today we will talk about how to automate small and medium businesses and ensure telephony operation by sharing YClients and our IP telephony. <br><br> <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/company/iptelefon/blog/354172/"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/6v/ed/zr/6vedzrjfe0kkecprlje7__lldtk.png"></a> <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Most companies solve the same tasks every day, so working with ready-to-use online services allows you to optimize processes at minimal cost, almost without investing in infrastructure.  Many have long used online systems for working with finance and accounting.  In addition, if you have something to store, you can use warehouse optimization tools.  Companies that work with private clients can successfully automate appointments and the entire communications chain. <br><br>  The YClients service, which we are talking about today‚Äôs integration, is focused on businessmen in the service sector.  Developers identify 24 typical areas of application of their service - from beauty salons and medical centers to car washes, driving schools and law firms.  In other words, a ready-made online recording service and automating a small company's core business processes helps provide IT support for businesses from the cloud.

      From a practical point of view, everything looks very simple.  You just need to register on the YClients website and model the structure of your business.  As a result, work with cash registers, accounts, warehouse management, control of the availability of consumables, personnel issues, payroll, checking the profitability of the business model and the matrix of services are available online and in a visual form, which is convenient for the entrepreneur. <br><br><h3>  Why integrate such a service with IP-telephony? </h3><br>  The integration of telephony and CRM has long established itself as a proven tool for business.  And if you take a closer look at it, it becomes obvious that YClients already contains its own specialized version of CRM, which helps automate key business processes for pre-recording online via various communication channels with the ability to send notifications and reminders. <br><br>  The YClients online database stores customer information and their service history, and if you integrate it with IP telephony, you get the opportunity to recognize a customer by phone number during a call, make calls on predetermined triggers, and also dial the person‚Äôs number directly from cards in the system.  All this increases customer loyalty by improving the quality of service, and also helps operators and managers work more efficiently.  And given that you don‚Äôt have to pay for this integration, the game is definitely worth it. <br><br>  <i>Web interface of the YClients client service module</i> <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/lz/yi/dp/lzyidpsiqn1qux_eys-qcruhl6y.png"><br><br><h3>  Connection and features of work </h3><br>  <i>YClients issues an encrypted connection token.</i> <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/8p/qb/gx/8pqbgxpbafrkx2bcz7jnxiqmjsq.png"><br><br>  The IPtelefon module is a ready-made widget for YClients that any user can connect.  If you are already working with YClients, just go to the <b>Overview</b> menu and select the <b>Calls</b> item.  If no one has yet integrated the IP telephony system in your account, YClients will provide you with a token for connection. <br><br>  <i>Entry form token to IP-PBX Zeon</i> <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/j0/rv/lf/j0rvlf6rm653_ntd5y78i8bfiks.png"><br><br>  When you have a token, you can use it in Zeon IP PBX.  In the <b>Integration</b> section of the <b>System</b> menu, you will find the ready-made section ‚ÄúIntegration with YClients‚Äù.  In the <b>Secret code</b> field, you will need to enter your token, and the two software modules will start working together, sharing data. <br><br>  <i>The system identified the incoming call from Maxim</i> <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/rs/wh/aq/rswhaqg5b5iuoul7ja7mzsimnek.png"><br><br>  After that, if an incoming call arrives on your virtual PBX, the Zeon IP-PBX will transmit the call information to the YClients CRM module, and the system will instantly find the client by phone number, showing his card to the secretary or operator.  If such a number is not yet in the database, the system will offer to create a new card right during the call. <br><br>  <i>Client card in YClients</i> <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/7f/0v/qb/7f0vqb-dsjn-fcm8rrrf24ofdis.png"><br><br>  As a result, customers do not have to spend time trying to tell who he is and what he needs.  The operator immediately recognizes Sergei, who needs to wash his Chevrolet Aveo again or Irina, who already has an appointment for a manicure specialist tomorrow.  This approach helps save time and creates a sense of concern for customers, increasing their loyalty. <br><br><h3>  Why use iptelefon? </h3><br>  The integration of YClients with IP-PBX Zeon from <a href="http://iptelefon.su/">iptelefon.su</a> has several advantages.  All settings are done automatically, it takes several minutes to launch joint services, and any technical support is available in chat or by phone.  But the most important thing is that you get a ‚Äúsingle window‚Äù for connecting all services, including <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/company/iptelefon/blog/350874/">virtual numbers</a> , <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/company/iptelefon/blog/272699/">corporate IP-SIM</a> , as well as other integration options and modern IP equipment.  You can order and test any telecommunication services right now on our <a href="http://iptelefon.su/">website</a> . </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/354172/">https://habr.com/ru/post/354172/</a></p>
