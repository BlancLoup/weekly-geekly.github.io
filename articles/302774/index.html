  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Will OpenStack be a ‚Äúnew LAMP‚Äù?</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  I think that every Habr user knows what <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/LAMP">LAMP is</a> .  But for me, LAMP is not just a bundle (stack) of Linux + Apache HTTP Server + MariaDB / MySQL + PHP / Python / Perl.  For me, this is a symbol of the fact that open source software can (and should) be the cause of revolutionary changes in the IT industry.  I am sure that it was thanks to LAMP that the Internet appeared in its current form.  Without what is hidden behind these four letters, there would be no Google, Facebook, ... and Habrahabr.  Well, at least it would not be as we know them.  Just imagine, the technologies with the help of which it became possible to create a <a href="http://www.vesti.ru/doc.html%3Fid%3D2715230">company with the largest capitalization in the world</a> , appeared only 20-25 years ago! <div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/3b7/191/de0/3b7191de09c44beaa4481851eda2eb51.png"></div>  When I wrote my post ‚Äú <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/post/279577/">Why did Citrix not become a‚Äú new Red Hat ‚Äùin the virtualization market?</a> ‚Äù, I thought that server virtualization could be another area of ‚Äã‚ÄãIT technology where open source software plays a key role.  Unfortunately, this (for now?) Did not happen, however <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/post/282734/">OpenStack is likely to be able to avoid errors</a> , and become the de facto standard for the data center.  Or not?  <u>Survey after the post.</u> <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  <b>What does OpenStack look like to LAMP?</b> <br>  Of course, OpenStack is largely related to LAMP.  Technically, <a href="http://www.zdnet.com/article/ubuntu-linux-continues-to-dominate-openstack-and-other-clouds/">Linux predominates when using OpenStack</a> , and OpenStack code is written in Python.  In addition ... I do not have statistics, but I think that it is not uncommon when OpenStack is needed for deploying LAMP stack virtual machines. <br><br>  But the main similarity between these stacks, of course, is not that there is an intersection in the software used.  The main thing is that it is based on a similar idea - if in a nutshell, it can be called ‚Äúfast scaling‚Äù (and cheap, which is sometimes more important).  LAMP allows you to quickly increase your resources - if you want to provide access not to a couple of web-sites, but, say, to a couple of hundreds ...  How long will it take for such an extension?  You just go to the nearest computer store, buy hardware there and ‚Äúfill in‚Äù LAMP without any problems with licensing and software purchase.  OpenStack in the same way allows you to quickly scale the required resources, but, of course, on a different, ‚Äúvirtual‚Äù level. <br><br>  Another similarity is that neither LAMP nor OpenStack is the result of the work of any one company, or more precisely, there is no clearly defined leader in these projects.  LAMP Stack is generally a fairly conditional combination, its components were developed in various projects, and although OpenStack was originally a project of NASA and Rackspace, dozens of other companies and independent developers quickly connected to it.

A little later, <a href="http://www.nixp.ru/news/12768.html">HP bought Eucalyptus</a> and Martin Mikos assumed the position of senior vice president and general manager of the HP Cloud division.  I recall that since 2012, <a href="http://www.nixp.ru/news/11743.html">HP has been building its cloud business with the help of OpenStack</a> , invested <a href="http://www.nixp.ru/news/12480.html">more than $ 1 billion in cloud solutions on this platform,</a> and in 2014 even <a href="http://www.nixp.ru/news/12803.html">became the most active developer of this IaaS</a> .  It turned out a kind of transition from one stack to another. <br><br>  <b>Bets made?</b> <br>  But how serious is all this?  Indeed, LAMP is a time-tested software complex, OpenStack is also considered to be a very young open source project.  In the comments to my previous post was the following statement: <blockquote>  ‚ÄúOpenstek is a HYIP, which, perhaps, will survive, and perhaps not.  Now he lives exclusively at the expense of corporations that are ready to pour money in there simply because there are a lot of them, this money. ‚Äù </blockquote>  This is a fairly common opinion, I hear it all the time, since the appearance of OpenStack (for almost 6 years!).  But corporations don't just pour money in anywhere, because they have a lot of money.  They invest where they see the potential return on these investments.  This is a very simple way to determine the viability of a particular technology ‚Äî you need to see if large companies invest their money in it.  After all, if they invest money in something, then they expect a return on investment. <br><br>  In recent years, investments in various projects and companies related to OpenStack have reached several billion dollars.  Recall the main financial transactions related to OpenStack: <ul><li>  EMC bought Cloudscaling, one of the leading providers of cloud services based on the OpenStack platform, for $ 50 million; </li><li>  The IBM Box service provider, Blue Box, has become the takeover target for IBM, but IBM also planned to spend $ 1.2 billion to build 15 new data centers; </li><li>  Cisco Systems, announced its intention to invest $ 1 billion in the development of its cloud business, acquired Piston Cloud and Metacloud (the amount was not disclosed, but this purchase was called the largest in the history of the OpenStack community); </li><li>  Red Hat acquired OpenStack, an eNovance firm, for $ 95 million; </li><li>  Mirantis raised $ 100 million in additional financing; </li><li>  About HPE, I already wrote above - more than $ 1 billion in the cloud business based on OpenStack; </li></ul><br>  It must also be said that the investments in OpenStack already give a return, for example, the aforementioned <a href="http://www.pcweek.ru/infrastructure/article/detail.php%3FID%3D184290">HPE and Cisco take leading positions in the production of cloud infrastructure</a> .  (Cisco is the main producer of infrastructure elements for public clouds, and HPE is for private ones.) In addition to the aforementioned companies, Oracle, SAP AB, Intel, Huawei, NEC, SUSE, Ericsson, VMware, Dell, NTT actively develop their competencies related to OpenStack. Citrix.  I want to draw attention to the fact that various companies have invested in the project.  Which once again confirms the <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/post/281376/">need to support Open Source throughout the IT industry</a> . <br><br>  So let's summarize.  The OpenStack project follows in the footsteps of LAMP, but at the same time it is more manageable and financially sustainable thanks to the OpenStack Foundation.  Investments of large IT companies in this project amount to several billion dollars.  In the development of the latest release of IaaS OpenStack 2336 developers from 345 different companies took part.  After that, do you have doubts about whether OpenStack can survive? <br><br>  ps: I would not want you to have the impression that OpenStack had no problems - they were, and quite serious, <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/post/282734/">I wrote</a> about some of them <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/post/282734/">in my last post</a> , and I would write about others in the following. <br><br>  Survey: Do you think that OpenStack for the data center can become the same de facto standard that LAMP has become for web servers? </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/302774/">https://habr.com/ru/post/302774/</a></p>
