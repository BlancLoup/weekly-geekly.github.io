But this evening I saw this game on Kickstarter, and as in the case of <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/181960/">SpinTires I</a> could not resist.  And not at all because our compatriots also make it, and not even because the movie is as natural as birds singing in the morning, but because it is ... fabulous.  And at the same time real.  This is not zakos (forgive me for such wording) under retro, it is precisely following the precepts, respect for traditions, and at the same time an original presentation so that we know once that we cannot forget.  I suppose that we do not want to forget.

To add weight to them, I had to do a short interview with the developers.  The more facets a stone has, the better it plays in the light.  Will you take the trouble to help me dig out our find? <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/164/da9/e6b/164da9e6b16c5845a85e82f1a8d7dfaf.png"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  To focus on the list of ‚Äúfeatures‚Äù or something similar, working in the gaming industry for a dozen years and realizing that the statement can be very different from reality, it is difficult.  Not to mention the fact that what was good on paper, in the form of a concept document or even in a demo version - may not fit into the game concept later.  This is normal.  Few people can foresee the flaws of game mechanics at the level of paper or the early concept. <br><br>  Therefore, most often have to rely on intuition or some kind of inner flair.  Feelings of taste.  Knowing of limits.  After watching the debut video for Kickstarter, I sat back in my chair and smiled contentedly.  In a brief video review, the creators have invested exactly what you need.  Emotions.  Mood.  A little game-play to the music.  And they also did not load the observer with themselves and with unnecessary details.  This tells me only about the sense of proportion in the presentation of information.  And it immediately has to itself. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/4dc/2d3/ff3/4dc2d3ff38aea2bd2eee34f171b20484.jpg"><br><br>  A similar feeling appeared after watching the <a href="http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/523651724/legend-of-iya">Legend of Iya</a> video.  He is different.  The same sincere, but more dramatic, imbued with the feelings of the developer who can not reach the desired turn.  Past this can not pass.  And people did not pass.  In the last days of the campaign, the situation was in crisis, but at the decisive moment the funds were found, and the developer who tried to make the game for almost a dozen years - finally got his auysvays to the sky.  Do not look at smiles, see the root.  A person who carries his burden for several years, and does not go where others have gone, is unlikely to consider himself successful against them.  But the man who did not give up is a stoic.  He can smile knowing that another defeat could be waiting for him.  That is the strength of the indie spirit.  Go without stopping and sacrifice much for the sake of dreams.  Do not look for easy solutions.  No doubt.  Recently, it has become fashionable among the domestic developer parties to present indie idlers who shove their crafts everywhere in the hope that the games will shoot. <br><br>  It is clear that these assumptions are sucked out of the fingers by craftsmen on the part of klonodelya, who seized the reins of casual and social games.  This is characteristically traced in a number of recent online publications.  I will not give examples.  Otherwise, very serious uncles will become angry, and comments on the article will be filled, forgive me, but with mud.  In other words, I cannot name what periodically occurs in the so-called ‚Äúmargins of respectable developers‚Äù. <br><br>  Here ... still ahead, the campaign has just begun, and so far the network has not yet been covered by outbreaks of massive publications.  I would venture to put forward the thesis that this video is more like a perfectly played melody than anything else.  This is my association.  My vision of what I saw.  But that is why I am here and ask you for help.  Not for myself.  Not for the developers.  And for our world of games with you.  That's what really needs our support.  The Pantheon of the Golden Games, in which the gold is hindered by heavy and marked copper from thick-bodied pinnacles.  However, all this is just my emotions.  And not by them I would like to occupy your morning time. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/f23/788/b0f/f23788b0f03a65f15c3fb00410fee45f.jpg"><br><br>  I was lucky to get to the developers and take a blitz-interview with them.  It seemed that it would be better for them and for us.  For us, because my enthusiasm will be pretty thinned out and in some places even washed away with a river of reliable information first-hand.  For them, because maybe among you there are the same fans of the genre and style who want to help these guys.  For this interview we were given exclusive content.  It may not be great, but what do they say?  Small spool but precious. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/84d/7cd/266/84d7cd266eed64c73e85689b588a3cf5.jpg"><br><br>  <i><b>Note:</b> I will quote one of the developers' quotes literally, as some kind of justification for lightly polishing the following text, which I wouldn‚Äôt dare if I weren‚Äôt given permission, namely, ‚ÄúOur Russian skill has deteriorated a bit over the years living in the states, so I apologize for the lexical errors.</i>  <i>You can freely fix what does not sound right. "</i> <br><br>  <i><b>Introduce youreself.</b></i>  <i><b>Names</b></i>  <i><b>Surnames.</b></i>  <i><b>Turns?</b></i> <br><br>  <i><b>Denis:</b></i> My name is Denis, in the video I'm on the right.  You already know your brother, - his name is Max, or Max, as you prefer.  Oh yeah ... last name.  Surprise!  Both Pashanin! <br>  <i>(Such a reaction to the simplest question is the fault of your humble servant. Having asked for the names, I also tried to find out the names, I don‚Äôt know what I was thinking at that moment. I prefer to write it off as an impression from the watched video, rather than as a language that often overtakes brain).</i> <br><br>  <i><b>What prompted you to do video games, was this choice spontaneous or conscious and thought out beforehand.</b></i>  <i><b>When did it happen?</b></i> <br><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Continuation of the interview</b> <div class="spoiler_text"> <i><b>Max:</b></i> For me it was never a question in reality, I was always sure that I would live games all my life. <br>  <i><b>Denis</b></i> (nods): I agree.  But in me, most likely, there was no such passion for game design, I preferred the technical aspects of the development more ... <br>  <i><b>Max:</b></i> This, by the way, describes the division of labor very well.  One deals with code, the other deals with art. <br>  <i><b>Denis:</b></i> ... well, or at least most of him (laughs).  Max‚Äôs task is mainly animation and concept art, and I have broader responsibilities: illustrations, coding and PR. <br><br>  <i><b>Where did your career begin, where did she move, and how did you find yourself where you are?</b></i> <br><br>  <i><b>Denis:</b></i> Our career has always focused on the technical aspects of development.  I think most people will perfectly understand how difficult it really is to achieve success as a hungry artist. <br>  <i><b>Max:</b></i> I understand you ... (nodding playfully to my brother).  Most attempts to enter the industry ended in unsuccessful indie projects.  But, in spite of this, an indestructible fire of passion ... to games always burned in us.  Now this is (thought for a moment) the tenth attempt to throw a fireball. <br>  <i><b>Denis:</b></i> Yeah ... of course.  One hundred and tenth. <br>  (both laugh) <br><br>  <i><b>What game projects did you work on before the Confederate Express?</b></i> <br><br>  <i><b>Denis:</b></i> Most of the work was done on a contract basis, but unfortunately paranoia with the NDA does not allow us to answer the question.  In the US, with the contract, the situation, uh ... confused? <br>  <i><b>Weilard:</b></i> No problem (waving his arms).  I have experience as a contract, and I know perfectly well what an NDA is. <br><br>  <i><b>What game projects have you worked on in the ‚Äúbig gaming industry‚Äù?</b></i>  <i><b>Your experience according to the profile on KS is more than 12 years and I think that readers would be interested in your other works.</b></i>  <i><b>(probably affects the day without sleep and I start to slow down)</b></i> <br><br>  <i><b>Denis:</b></i> (presses his hands to his chest and elevates his eyes to the sky in prayer) <br>  <i><b>Weilard:</b></i> (I press <i><b>mine</b></i> in response and roll it too) <br><br>  <i><b>When did you start working on this project?</b></i> <br><br>  <i><b>Denis:</b></i> Work on this project began 2 years ago, but the code was completely written within 4 months;  Art took about two to three months. <br>  <i><b>Max:</b></i> Yes, about three.  Most of the time was spent on R &amp; D style development, technical animation, etc.  After we developed the system, the train rushed fast enough. <br><br>  <i><b>What was the impetus for creating this game?</b></i> <br><br>  <i><b>Max:</b></i> Definitely a kickstarter. <br>  <i><b>Denis:</b></i> Yes, there is no doubt.  With the rapidly growing popularity of the indie movement, Kickstarter has become a beacon in a storm for many of the lost game designers who have lowered their hands.  We are really very grateful to the creators of the portal. <br>  <i><b>Max.</b></i>  Absolutely.  Without them, none of this would have been possible. <br><br>  <i><b>What games inspire you, where do you get your inspiration from?</b></i> <br><br>  <i><b>Denis:</b></i> Our main inspirations are all the classic games of the 90s era, ranging from X-Com, EOB (Eye of the Beholder), C &amp; C, Doom, Lands of Lore, Ultima, M &amp; M and ending with more modern (well, relatively modern) Wizardry games , Baldur's Gate, Diablo ... in general there are many.  But basic, yes.  These. <br>  <i><b>Max:</b></i> For the current project, the main inspiration was the Jagged Alliance and FTL, which ultimately led to the fact that ConEx is a mixture of two ... <br>  <i><b>Denis:</b></i> (interrupts brother) ... types of games ... adventures and exploration in the style of FTL, but of battle and team game we have with an eye to Jagged Alliance 2. <br><br>  <i><b>Could you tell the audience Habra, a little more about who and what is doing on this project?</b></i>  <i><b>And who the hell is responsible for this beautiful animation?</b></i> <br><br>  <i><b>Max:</b></i> (laughs) thanks for the compliment, the animation was drawn by me.  Denis, as mentioned earlier, deals with the technical side. <br>  <i><b>Denis:</b></i> Yes, but we diligently discuss all ideas and assumptions on a daily basis, and until the result satisfies both of us, we always continue to work to eradicate problems. <br>  <i><b>Max:</b></i> Yeah.  We have a very simple philosophy about this.  If something looks bad, then it is better not to add it at all.  For example, in the demo video there is no directional animation of the fire, as we are still working on how it looks, and will continue to work until we are completely satisfied with the result.  Then you will see it too. <br><br>  <i><b>Is it planned to support the Russian language in the game?</b></i> <br><br>  <i><b>Max:</b></i> Absolutely, absolutely and precisely.  But unfortunately we are planning to keep the original voice acting.  I think that it is much easier to implement this through services in the CIS, such as Buki or 1C ... They still exist, right? <br>  (I didn‚Äôt notice a shadow of a smile, but prepare to bet that it was a joke. I think that if I were in their place I would have designed it that way. But I‚Äôm not afraid to know that. Even if I remind you of this phrase, it‚Äôs unlikely whether they will remember it exactly. And now the brothers have their cases above the roof). <br><br>  <i><b>I understand that the question is more than premature, but ... what plans do you have for the future?</b></i>  <i><b>What do you plan to do after Confederate Express?</b></i> <br><br>  <i><b>Denis:</b></i> There are 3 major projects in the plans, all in order of increasing complexity.  We plan to gain experience before doing something big. <br>  <i><b>Weilard:</b></i> That sounds reasonable. <br>  <i><b>Max:</b></i> Our final goal is an improved version of Fallout 2, with a pixelart graphic style. <br>  <i><b>Weilard:</b></i> (in this place my eyes start to bulge) <br>  <i><b>Denis:</b></i> Yes, yes.  This is not a joke or madness (laughs).  We will try to implement the technical side at a high level, and we hope that the experience of releasing previous projects will help us in this.  Plus, the engine that we demonstrate will be much more perfect than it is now ... well, at least I hope so. <br><br>  <i><b>I already spent a lot of your time.</b></i>  <i><b>In conclusion of this blitz-interview.</b></i>  <i><b>Maybe you want to add something to the audience of the largest IT resource in Russia (and this is not advertising, God forbid), just a statement of the fact that thousands of IT people and gamers of all stripes and calibers will hear you today (this is happening this morning)?</b></i> <br><br>  <i><b>Denis:</b></i> We are wary of promises of any type, but we will make every effort to achieve a peak in the development of classic games, which, to the chagrin, most developers abandoned in exchange for quick profits. <br>  <i><b>Max:</b></i> We hope that we will finally have an audience that can share our views on what a good game should look like.  We really appreciate your support!  Thanks for attention! <br><br>  <i><b>I would not say better.</b></i>  <i><b>And thank you so much!</b></i>  <i><b>Good luck with this and other projects.</b></i>  <i><b>And I hope we do not say goodbye.</b></i> <br><br>  <i><b>Note:</b> I don‚Äôt know about you, but I believe these guys.</i>  <i>And I wish you every success.</i>  <i>Well, we'll see a selection of exclusive materials (in addition to the screenshots that were provided to us for the article) that slipped from the workbench of this duet.</i>  <i>Call it in the style of collectible DVDs ...</i> <br></div></div><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/3ef/cb3/04d/3efcb304df956acabe3ad80ce5549168.jpg"><br><br>  Sample yet exclusive materials (especially for Habr): <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/199/87b/940/19987b940c1fcdc872887518cd4004f7.gif"><br><br>  Sample non-exclusive material available in the official order: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/ff1/d49/29b/ff1d4929b89ee5506a8c9cbe1355e27b.gif"><br><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Full set of images</b> <div class="spoiler_text">  <b>Exclusive</b> <br>  <a href="">Screen 1</a> <br>  <a href="">Screen 2</a> <br>  <a href="">Screen 3</a> <br>  <a href="">Screen 4</a> <br>  <a href="">Screen 5</a> <br><br>  <b>Animated presentations</b> <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/4ce/e68/252/4cee682525f78f7d8321ce870bfd658a.gif"><br>  Ambient Occlusion work in CE <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/562/974/e68/562974e6867426d0602503043bded094.gif"><br>  That same "work of fire" which is not.

The so-called "hot details."  I think that they can please many. <br><br>  <b>1.</b> As I recall, in the comments to the publication, readers were interested in the lighting technology of the game CE.  It will be disclosed in the next two updates.  I do not know for certain in what order this will happen, but that this will happen is a fact. <br>  <b>2.</b> For music lovers (to whom I attribute myself) it will be nice to know the author of the soundtrack, which we could hear in the video.  Not only learn, but also listen to the full track on SoundCloud - this is <a href="https://soundcloud.com/adhesivewombat/wombat-anthem">AdhesiveWombat - Anthem</a> <br>  <b>3.</b> In the coming days (week) a blog will be added, which is nice news in it will be ‚Äúvoiced‚Äù also in our own language. <br>  <b>4.</b> Stretch Goal's will soon appear, which, with good activity from the players (which I personally have no doubt), will expand the world of CE and will bring much joy to the bakers. <br>  <b>5. A</b> new plage (or plage) will appear. <br>  <b>6.</b> Appetizers and bonuses will appear, CE authors are now working on it tirelessly.  Details, unfortunately, I can not disclose with all the desire.  It is enough for me that this will happen.  And ... you know, for a long time I didn‚Äôt just so easily communicate with the developers.  Without any politeness, just as if we were sitting in a coffee shop.  This is a real balm for any indie. <br>  <b>7.</b> Support for other operating systems has not yet been announced, but not denied.  Therefore, all this can be decided in the future. <br>  <b>8.</b> Starting tomorrow, due to my recovery, I am returning from my bed to my work, in which I have accumulated a lot of unfinished business.  Therefore, the "support of the article" stop.
