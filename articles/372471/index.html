  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Neo Smart Pen 2 Review - Smart Pen with Smart Notepad</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Neo Smart Pen 2 is one of the representatives of the ‚Äúglorious family‚Äù of <a href="https://geektimes.ru/company/medgadgets/blog/264212/">smart writing accessories</a> , which differs from its closest competitors by the absence of a ‚Äúbase‚Äù that receives the signal.  The base is replaced by a special smart notebook with its own markup, thanks to which synchronization with the smartphone takes place. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/71d/536/d9a/71d536d9a2b9418992cfcfd7eff97888.jpg"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  After a rather long contact with <a href="https://geektimes.ru/company/medgadgets/blog/245190/">Equill</a> , the first thing that seems to be a significant advantage of the Neo Pen is the absence of an additional element or base, which on the one hand simplifies synchronization with a smartphone: in Equill this happened as if in several stages.  First, the base was synchronized with a smartphone and tablet, then with a pen.  Secondly, it affects the mobility of the device.  Well, as a general result: ease of use, fast connection, charge control on only one element. <br><br>  <b>Notebooks</b>

      <br>
      Just the role of the ‚Äúreceiver of the signal‚Äù, or the notorious base, in the Neo system is performed by notebooks, which bear their own special markup.  On the one hand, and this somewhat burdensome, since notepads, at least, cost money, on the other hand, the company offers free special software that allows you to print sheets for working with a pen <a href="http://www.neosmartpen.com/en/products/n_toaster">yourself</a> . <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/577/5e2/15a/5775e215a1614261983eb4b0b5cb399b.jpg"><br><br>  The kit includes a small notebook, relatively speaking ‚Äútest‚Äù, which will allow you to make a number of notes. <br><br>  All notebooks are recognized and stored in the application, and to use more blank sheets than there is in the notebook will not work.  If you want to go to a page on which something has already been written, after a while, the drawing will be recreated, and the new records will go along with the existing ones. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/f5b/8a7/b7c/f5b8a7b7c82848f4b085413e186b0d79.jpg"><br><br>  <b>Synchronization</b> <br><br>  Smart Pen 2 has a single button that turns on, syncs, and turns off the device.  It is located almost at the opposite end of the rod, next to the output for charging, which is very thoughtful and will not allow you to click on it, accidentally disconnecting the device during operation. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/2a6/122/d2a/2a6122d2ab944bf8a9e684cb25289de4.jpg"><br><br>  Synchronization takes place at the prompts in a few simple steps, after which you can immediately proceed to work with notes.  To activate the sheet, you just need to click the rod on the "envelope" icon in the corner of the page, after which a blank sheet of paper will open in the application.  Synchronization occurs in real time, and you can watch the characters appear on the screen.  The color and size of the lines can be selected in the special menu, which is located in the corner of the page. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/b33/3b6/6cf/b333b66cf9884f8d8df64e963c6b52ab.jpg"><br><br>  After the pen goes into standby mode and is lost by the application, you can return it to collaboration with the software by clicking on the ‚Äúpen‚Äù symbol in the right-hand corner of the screen.  However, you can work without connecting.  If the pen is on, which is symbolized by a lit indicator on the case, then everything written is recognized and after. <br><br>  <b>Moleskine</b> <br><br>  One of the first major brands to notice Smart Pen 2 (after the Medgadgets, of course :)) was Moleskine.  There are already several large ‚Äúgeek-partnerships‚Äù on the company's account.  The first smart pen that <a href="http://www.moleskine.com/en/news/livescribe-notebook">became a Moleskine partner is Livescribe</a> .  Also known "smart notebooks¬ª Moleskine + Evernote with a set of smart stickers, for example, <a href="http://www.moscowbooks.ru/book.asp%3Fid%3D736711">such</a> . <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/e42/bfb/e8d/e42bfbe8dcb84650a21520e74dc889ff.jpg"><br><br>  And in April of this year, Gizmodo <a href="http://gizmodo.com/moleskines-smartpen-digitizes-your-notebooks-as-youre-w-1768218371">published information</a> that Moleskine announced a partnership with the Neo Pen 2. Now the <a href="https://store.moleskine.com/usa/en-us/moleskine-/smart-writing-set/smart-writing-set/p1014%3Fic%3DOlIz7g%253D%253D">price is $ 199</a> in the western official store.  In Russia, the <a href="http://medgadgets.ru/shop/neo-smartpen-n2.html%3Futm_source%3Dgktms%26utm_medium%3Dneopen2%26utm_campaign%3Dneopen2">cost of the pen is 13,990 rubles</a> . <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/441/d66/657/441d6665718c48019f804341ad19c6f5.jpg"><br><br>  <b>Kit and features</b> <br><br>  In the basic set you get a pen with a replaceable rod, one small notebook, charging cable and instructions.  Unfortunately, both the instructions and the application are currently in foreign languages, which, however, does not overshadow contact with the device so much: everything is pretty clear and simple. <br><br>  Despite the lack of "localization", the Russian language is in the application: it can be downloaded so that the pen can correctly perform one of the functions: recognize handwritten text and process it into printed characters. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/ef1/4c0/a1e/ef14c0a1efd1465ea721223dbbb0f29a.jpg"><br><br><ul><li>  Battery type: Rechargeable Li-Polymer battery. </li><li>  Autonomous work: for 5 days without recharging, when using the pen for 1-2 hours per day. </li><li>  Charging time: 2 hours to fully charge </li><li>  Internal Memory: Nand Flash 90MB </li><li>  Saving recordings in internal memory: 1000 A4 pages </li><li>  Image Sensor: 120fps / 1100DPI </li><li>  Handle continuous use time: 5 ~ 8 hours </li><li>  Dimensions: length - 157 mm;  thickness - 12 mm </li><li>  Weight: 22 gr. </li><li>  Colors: black;  silvery white </li><li>  Aluminium case </li></ul><br><br>  <b>Video</b> <br><br>  Channel <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC67u3s8HKQysvPrJojEs-HA">Geek to The Future,</a> at our request, recorded his opinion about the device: <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/y0uFDOKTPbw" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  <b>Handle on Geektimes</b> <br><br>  One of the first Geektimes users who <a href="https://geektimes.ru/post/243963/">got a pen and wrote about it</a> was <a href="https://geektimes.ru/users/kevin/" class="user_link">kevin</a> .  Frankly, in a year and a half, no significant changes have occurred: the software has been updated, the box has been updated, additional languages ‚Äã‚Äãhave been added ... <br><br>  <b>Digitization</b> <br><br>  The software provides several additional features, including messaging, sending by mail, synchronizing with Evernote and Google Drive.  One of the most curious is text recognition, and here, as already noted, support for the Russian-language alphabet is implemented. <br><br>  To use the function, you first need to download the desired language in the settings, and then just use the drop-down menu.  Everything happens instantly, fairly accurately, and do not consider it a boldness, but the only word with which difficulties arose: ‚ÄúGiktatimes‚Äù: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/a31/4e8/91b/a314e891b2f04582831a75dc0ea6ed0a.jpg"><br><br>  The cost of the handle is <a href="http://medgadgets.ru/shop/neo-smartpen-n2.html%3Futm_source%3Dgktms%26utm_medium%3Dneopen2%26utm_campaign%3Dneopen2">13,990 rubles</a> . </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/372471/">https://habr.com/ru/post/372471/</a></p>
