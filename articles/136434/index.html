By function, they are all divided into 4 groups.  The technical documentation team develops materials that help the user understand the program.  These are product GUI texts, help integrated into the product, and accompanying documents, such as the User Guide.  Texts are written by technical writers. <br>  The localization of texts into languages ‚Äã‚Äãis done by translators and engineers of the localization group.  Today we localize our products into 33 languages.  The main languages ‚Äã‚Äãare Russian, English, German, French and for some products Chinese.  It is clear that it is impossible to localize a product into 33 languages ‚Äã‚Äãby only staff members.  To help we attract translation agencies and native speakers around the world. <a name="habracut"></a>

      After the text is written and translated, employees of the quality control team proceed to work.  They check how fully and qualitatively the product description is given, whether it is correct from a linguistic point of view.  Of course, it also does not do without freelance native speakers.  The number of full-time and freelance professionals involved in the process of creating localization may exceed 20 people.  This process is closely related to budget, financial reporting and requires clear coordination and transparency.  For these purposes, there is a fourth division - the document management and localization project management team.  Its employees provide the organization and control of the entire process of localization of the product within specific projects. <br><br>  <b>- They say that not so long ago you had a new position with the rather curious name ‚Äúterminology manager‚Äù ...</b> <br><br>  - Yes, and the presence of this position in my department is correct and justified.  LK produces a lot of products and services, accompanied not only by user documentation, but also by various marketing materials.  It is important that among the many documents our client does not ‚Äúget lost‚Äù in terms of what we call product features, our technologies and not only.  Terminology must be inherited from version to version, from product to product.  The need for uniform terminology arose not only in my department.  The regional offices have repeatedly asked us to share a glossary, which they could use to write advertising and marketing articles, as well as to make changes to it, dictated by the language and the market.  All over the world, in large companies, which, like LC, cover a vast market, terminology management is a whole direction in localization, aimed not only at the unification of terminology.  The glossary gives a chance to significantly save on the cost of translation, as well as an input requirement for agencies, the basis for penalties, etc. In other words, the glossary is a standard way to minimize risks from both the customer and the contractor.  With our number of localization languages, it is simply impossible to ignore the field of systematization of terminology. <br><br>  <b>- What steps have already been taken?</b> <br><br>  - Now we are working on the creation of a corporate glossary.  So far this is a set of terms with translation and a number of other criteria, but later on each of them is planned to write a small dictionary entry.  The global idea is that this glossary will be able to use not only the specialists of our department, but also any employee of the Laboratory. <br><br>  <b>- So now the glossary contains some terms recommended for use?</b> <br><br>  - Not only.  The glossary also contains terms that cannot be used.  After all, the use of the ‚Äúwrong‚Äù term can entail not only reputational, but also legal risks.  For example, we do not give tough judgments about any software, but at the same time we warn the user that attackers can use this program to harm his computer. <br><br>  The glossary is the source in which we fix all forbidden terms.  Moreover, we indicate which terms should be replaced, and ensure the absence of prohibited terminology in the descriptions of all products being prepared for release. <br><br>  <b>- And at what stage of the product creation does your department connect to the work?</b> <br><br>  - Almost from the very beginning, at the stage of product prototyping, when the system requirements are written, an interface layout is being prepared, which needs to be coordinated with the regions where it will be sold.  So we proceed to localization, when the interface is still being drawn and exists, so to speak, in pictures. <br><br>  <b>- Should a technical writer or localizer be in the subject, to understand the details of the working area?</b> <br><br>  - <u>The writer is a specialist in collecting information and transmitting it in a way that is understandable and accessible to any user.</u>  <u>It is not necessary that he be a techie or a super-linguist.</u>  <u>First of all, he should be a very good interviewer with an analytical mindset.</u>  <u>Of course, the presence of a technical background is welcome, and we are interested in employees who have experience in the IT industry.</u>  <u>Acquire it for a long time, and we do not always have the opportunity to take people who need to be trained.</u> <u><br><br></u>  <u>We don‚Äôt favor writers who worked in the public sector, where there is a clear requirement to write in Gostov formats - ‚Äúdry‚Äù language, impersonal constructions, passive voices, etc.</u> time stylistically seasoned and initially ready for translation without processing in the localization language. <br>  Localizer - this is probably a unique specialist, combining experience and a linguist and a techie.  Localization is far from being only a translation: it is a process of adapting a product to the characteristics of a certain territory.  Often our localizers act as translators if they know the language perfectly.  However, the main share of the engineer‚Äôs working time is taken by technical manipulations with the source text, which sometimes reduces the amount of translation by 80% or more.  Localizers have to understand the implementation technologies of the graphical interface in order to be able to adapt the product, taking into account the characteristics of the localization language.  Otherwise, the product will not be perceived by the target audience for which it is designed, which means it is unlikely to be purchased. <br><br>  <b>- What are your requirements for your translators?</b>  <b>What experience should they have?</b>  <b>How many languages ‚Äã‚Äãdo you know?</b> <br><br>  - English is a must.  Knowledge of the localization language at the carrier level is a must!  Knowledge of other languages ‚Äã‚Äãis very desirable.  I have already said that we localize our products into 33 languages.  And every year their number increases. <br><br>  It is important that the specialist has experience in translating IT materials.  We will never use the services of specialists who have translated, for example, only medical literature.  It is terrible to think how they can translate a phrase like ‚Äúcure an object‚Äù. <br>  <b>- There is an opinion that nobody reads the documentation.</b>  <b>What do you think of it?</b> <br><br>  - <u>Yes, perhaps, in Russia, with its mentality, there is no such culture yet.</u>  <u>I think this is due to the fact that most of the accompanying documents in our country in Soviet times were written in the style of scientific articles, and it was extremely difficult to understand something from them.</u> <u><br><br></u>  <u>In other countries, the attitude towards accompanying documents and certificates is completely different.</u>  <u>Before you purchase a product, future users, in addition to independent technical tests, refer to the documentation.</u>  Our task is to provide a potential client with information about the product in an accessible form, regardless of the language that our user speaks and its technical background.  It is important even at the stage of familiarization with the document to create the right impression about the product. <br>  Creating documentation here, in Russia, it is necessary, first of all, to remember that we create it for our users all over the world, and it is impossible to approach the writing of texts on the basis of the principle that it is not ‚Äúread‚Äù. <br><br>  <b>- LC is the only domestic company present in so many markets.</b>  <b>It can be assumed that the documentation and localization department is the most powerful in Russia.</b> <br><br>  - Over the years of work, we have gained a lot of experience, and today, perhaps, in fact, we are the best company in the country in localizing our products.  We use the most advanced documenting and localization technologies.  But an objective assessment is, as is known, an assessment from the outside.  Once a question regarding user documentation was discussed at one of the thematic forums, and one of the forum participants left such a comment: "Ask this writers and localizers from the LC, they are very cool there, and surely they would have an answer." <br><br>  <u>Today we are often invited to various conferences both at home and abroad, asking to share experiences.</u>  <u>For Europe and America, where, unlike Russia, technical writers and localizers are professions taught in universities, our department is really nonsense.</u>  <u>Many people wonder how we managed to debug the process of localization into so many languages ‚Äã‚Äãwithout having a specialized higher education.</u>  Russian companies seeking to enter the international market contact us for advice.  All this confirms once again that in Russia my employees are already recognized experts in the field of documentation and localization.  And I, as the head of the unit, are very proud of them! </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/136434/">https://habr.com/ru/post/136434/</a></p>
