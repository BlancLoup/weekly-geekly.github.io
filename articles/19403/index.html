  <section class="page js-page"><h1>About two models of business incubator</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  In my blog and in the comments, I have already mentioned several times about one American business incubator Y Combinator, for example, in the article ‚Äú <a href="http://www.itechbridge.com/forum/index.php%3Fshowtopic%3D56893">Startup: a formula for success</a> ‚Äù.  Back to this topic made me another, not my <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blog/startup/34557.html">note</a> .  It was about the Russian business incubator Inventure.  I wanted to compare these two models. <br>  A lot has already been written about Y Combinator on the Internet.  Naturally, there is the site of this incubator.  Does not leave him unattended and the local American press, like television, too.  As for Inventure, I could not find anything besides the indicated note.  Not yet a corporate site.  Therefore, I built a comparison, starting from the quotations from this article about the Russian incubator. <br><br>  I do not draw any conclusions at the same time, leaving it to the readers.  Unfortunately, in Habr√© there is no possibility to connect the polling mechanism directly to the note.  However, I would be grateful if you answer the following questions in your comments: <br><br>  1. Can there be an incubator built according to the Y Combinator model in the CIS countries? <br>  2. And if so, do you know something like that? <br>  3. Can there be an Inventure incubator in the West? <br>  4. And if so, do you know something like that? <br>  5. Do you know other models of existing business incubators?

      So,‚Ä¶ <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  <strong>Think for yourself, decide for yourself ...</strong> <br><br><blockquote>  Former places of work <em>(founder - AM)</em> : Kommersant Publishing House (1990-1998; from a correspondent to the chief editor of the Kommersant newspaper and general director of Kommersant-Daily CJSC), YUKOS (1998-2004; head of communications with the public, management of the company's media holding), Sekret Firmy Publishing House (2004‚Äì2007; co-founder, CEO and chief editor) </blockquote><br><br>  The founders of Y Combinator (as far as I remember, 3 people) are business professionals with deep IT knowledge, well known in this field.  Started as programmers - developers.  At the dawn of their business, they themselves launched several IT startups. <br><blockquote>  An organizational incubator consists of several blocks that ‚Äúlead‚Äù a startup from the moment of its first contact with the incubator to the moment the fund ‚Äúleaves‚Äù the project: search, production, development, support and analysis.  Above all the blocks is the Investment Council. </blockquote><br><br>  The internal structure of the Y Combinator is elementary simple.  And, more precisely, there is no structure.  The main activities related to the activities of the incubator are performed by the founders themselves.  By the way, they are opposed to calling their company an incubator. <br><br><blockquote>  By the way, the incubator specializes mainly in online projects. </blockquote><br><br>  The same is Y Combinator plus other programmer projects.  Moreover, they explain this with their IT background. <br><br><blockquote>  Since the incubator considers projects that are actually at the idea stage (pre-seed stage), startups will have to accept the idea that Inventure will receive a share of 50% + 1 share in the project - the incubator is oriented towards the controlling stake. </blockquote><br><br>  I can only guess what the author understands by the pre-seed stage.  Y Combinator calls it more familiar and simple: seed - stage.  However, as you will see later, they actually work at the same stage as Inventure, if not even a bit earlier.  And at the same time they claim no more than 10% (usually 5-7%) in a funded startup. <br><br>  <em>Read more on my <a href="http://www.itechbridge.com/forum/index.php%3Fshowtopic%3D73825">iTech Bridge blog.</a></em> <em><a href="http://www.itechbridge.com/forum/index.php%3Fshowtopic%3D73825"><br></a></em> <br>  - <em><u>Note after the publication of this note.</u></em>  <em>Dear "plus" and no less respected "minus"! ..
