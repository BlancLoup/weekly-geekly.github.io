      LotusLive is a family of interoperable web-based business communication and collaboration tools that extend beyond the corporate walls of a customer.  What is or will be included in this family, and what services the enterprise-customer (together with its clients) can receive today or in the foreseeable future. <br><br>  <a href="https://www.lotuslive.com/">LotusLive products are</a> divided into two groups: <br><br>  1. <b>Products that provide, in fact, typical social networking services (Networking &amp; Collaborating)</b> : <br>  - <i>LotusLive Engage</i> (registration is open to participate in beta testing - you can try) <br>  - <i>LotusLive Connections</i> (coming soon - wait) <br><br>  2. <b>Products for organizing and conducting various kinds of web events (Web Conferencing):</b> <br>  - <i>LotusLive Meetings</i> (you can subscribe to the first turn of services, there is a demo version) <br>  - <i>LotusLive Events</i> (the first stage of services also went on sale) <br><br>  Anyway, while to a lesser extent, and then to a greater degree, all these products are integrated with office ‚Äúboxed‚Äù Lotus products and, above all, with a pair of Lotus Notes-Lotus Domino, the corresponding equivalents of MS Outlook-MS Exchange Server. <br><br>  Unlike Microsoft, IBM has not yet made public its plans for the emergence of the cloud versions of Lotus Notes and Lotus Domino (in any case, I have not met such information).  I think there can be no talk about the transfer to Lotus 1-2-3 clouds (analogue of MS Excel) and other predecessors of the corresponding Microsoft office programs.  Here IBM lost its war completely and irrevocably.  The bet is more on the prospect of integration with relatives from Microsoft.  Fortunately, an open platform based on ASP.  Net is always at hand. <br><br>  But IBM struck from the other side.  Strategic partnership announced with LinkedIn, Skype and Salesforce.  How, when, and which partner services will be integrated with LotusLive, again hidden in thick fog.  However, you see, the prospects here open up very interesting. <br><br>  And now, literally, a few words about each component of LotusLive.  At the same time, I‚Äôll say a little more about services related to web-based activities, which are less common for social networking systems. <br><br>  <b>LotusLive Engage</b> is a subset of services for preparing and conducting web events, expanded by a number of typical social switching services. <br><br>  <b><i>A web event (web-conferencing)</i></b> is any meeting, conference, seminar, etc., held over the Internet.  This group of services includes: <br><br>  <i>Application share</i> - computer software sharing <br>  <i>Meeting record</i> - web event logging <br>  <i>Pol</i> l - poll of participants (voting) <br>  <i>Videocasting</i> - video broadcasting <br>  <i>SSL encryption</i> - information <i>encryption</i> (information security) <br>  <i>Online storage</i> - file sharing with labeling tools (tag) <br>  <i>Forms</i> - creation of various forms, incl.  for polls <br>  <i>Chart</i> - Spreadsheet Visualization <br><br>  The <b><i>social switching services</i></b> include: <br><br>  <i>Activities</i> - so in all Lotus products is called something between a wall (wall) on Facebook and microblogging on Twitter. <br>  <i>Instant Messaging</i> - <i>instant messaging</i> <br><br>  <b>LotusLive Connections</b> is a cloud version of LotusConnection.  An almost complete set of typical social-switching and social-media services (with a greater focus on texts) of services inherent in developed Web 2.0 resources.  Sorry, the wiki is missing.  It seems that LotusLive Connections is a new name for what IBM first <a href="http://www.itechbridge.com/forum/index.php%3Fshowtopic%3D122395">announced as Bluehouse</a> .  Anyway, if you try to go to bluehouse.lotus.com, now you‚Äôll get either LotusLive Connections (yesterday) or (today already) go to the LotusLive home page. <br><br>  <b>LotusLive Meetings</b> is a cloud-based version of the Lotus Sametime Unyte Meeting.  A complete set of services for web events.  In addition to the relevant services included in the LotusLive Engage, these include the following services: <br><br>  <i>Hosting</i> - hosting events <br>  <i>Publishing</i> - web publishing for participants of documents (files) from the repository <br>  <i>Voice Conferencing</i> - holding a teleconference (sound only) <br>  <i>Recording</i> - recording the event on the disc <br>  <i>Audiocasting</i> - audio <i>broadcast</i> <br>  <i>Roster</i> - the operational tool for leading <br><br>  <b>LotusLive Events</b> is a cloud version of Lotus Sametime Unyte Events.  A complete set of services for the preparation of web events (including registration of participants) and the subsequent analysis of its results. <br><br>  As far as I know, the first of the four products listed (LotusLive Engage) is intended for autonomous use as a means of providing a certain subset of the sum of the services of the three remaining products.  At the same time, LotusLive Connections, LotusLive Meetings, and LotusLive Events can (and best of all) be used in integrated mode. <br><br>  <i>The <a href="http://www.itechbridge.com/forum/index.php%3Fshowtopic%3D133269">following article</a> provides a conceptual comparison of IBM LotusLive with MS SharePoint Online - its main competitor in this area.</i> <i><br><br></i>  <i>I remind you that the general chronicle of the battles on the front of cloud-based Enterprise 2.0 is given in <a href="http://www.itechbridge.com/forum/index.php%3Fshowtopic%3D133157">my previous article</a> .</i> <i><br></i> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/50599/">https://habr.com/ru/post/50599/</a></p>
