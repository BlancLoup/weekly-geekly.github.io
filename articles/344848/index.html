Oh yes, my name is Zhenya, I work at Wrike, I often speak at front-end conferences, and yes, I am a member of the program committee of one of them.  With HolyJS, I was from the first day, first as a speaker, and then once I was asked to help with the moderation of reports, so it began to turn.  Therefore, the comprehension will be more likely in the format of a retrospective report, and not a participant's response (for example, read <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/company/mailru/blog/317694/">last year‚Äôs article by</a> Darya Pushkarskaya, I recommend).  Therefore, I will not describe the reports word for word, it‚Äôs better to watch the video.  But I would like to tell you what is happening behind the scenes of a large conference, what went well, what could have been done better, how we all got tired <s>take us away</s> . <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/b65/629/747/b6562974758ea3ae37940c340ce1c26f.jpg" alt="image"><br>  <sub>PC in full force.</sub>  <sub>Photo from <a href="https://vk.com/holyjs">vk.com/holyjs</a></sub> <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h1>  What do you do, huh? </h1><br>  Now there are 4 people in the PC (program committee): <a href="https://twitter.com/bunopus">Your humble servant</a> , <a href="https://twitter.com/mike1pol">Mikhail Poluboyarinov</a> , <a href="https://twitter.com/DmitryMakhnev">Dmitry Makhnev</a> and <sub>Vadim, why did you choose such a nickname for yourself, I am constantly confused</sub> <a href="https://twitter.com/_bmsdave">Vadim Gorbachev</a> .  Actually, we are the very people who decide whether a particular report falls into the conference program or not.  <a href="https://twitter.com/deni_deniskina">Tanya Denisyuk</a> , program coordinator, helps us desperately.  Misha and I have already somehow told what the PC does ( <a href="https://spb-frontend.ru/podcast/19">listen</a> ), but if in brief, all our work is divided into three parts: receiving and selecting applications, training the speakers and the conference itself.  Let's talk more about each stage. <br><br><h3>  Selection </h3><br>  Speakers at the conference come in two ways: through the <a href="https://holyjs-piter.ru/callforpapers/">CFP</a> and at our invitation.  And, if everything is clear with the first (by the way, the filing of applications for Peter 2018 is already open!), Then who do we call ourselves?

      <b>First</b> , they are iconic people in the industry.  Douglas Crockford, Lia Vera, Eddie Osmani, Dan Abramov and so on.  This is how it will turn out: someone is ready to come, someone is not, usually celebrities are very tight with the schedule, so it‚Äôs not always possible to get the stars out.  Plus Russia is far and incomprehensible, and conferences often come together: ‚Äúwe were the first to bring something, but what did you achieve?‚Äù. <br><br>  <b>Secondly</b> , these are HolyJS speakers of past years.  Why is it so important to complete feedback after each conference?  Yes, because it is for these estimates, we understand whether to call the speaker again.  Did the person like the audience, how he should improve his performances, what topic is interesting.  What distinguishes HolyJS from many other conferences is the increased pedantry regarding feedback.  And it's cool, I'm talking to you as a speaker.  Otherwise, what would we post on Twitter? <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/wk/kw/yg/wkkwygljkwuapzrhm6fy8s5tk00.png"><br><br>  <b>Thirdly</b> , these are people who have once appeared somewhere.  I will tell you a secret, among the organizers and the PC there is such a huge sign, in which there is almost everyone who has acted somewhere, wrote, did workshops, and so on.  So a speech at a local mitap or an article on Habr√© can be very useful. <br><br>  The fact that we call the speaker ourselves does not always mean that he is automatically accepted into the program at all.  It would be unfair to those who submit applications through the form.  <i>Of course, Douglas Crockford did not submit an application, but this is rather an exception</i> .  I wish there was a competition of interesting topics, not personalities.  However, one should take into account that there are bison speakers who are almost guaranteed to tell any topic well (for example, Roma Dvornov, but more about it later), and only beginners (for example, <a href="http://2017.holyjs-piter.ru/talks/react-approach-is-overrated/">Nikita Isaev</a> spoke for the first time last year). <br><br>  By the end of CFP (Call For Papers), we have recruited an approximate pool of applications, we have already talked to almost all the speakers, discussed everything, and this is where the hardest thing begins.  We start <s>drinking a</s> lot <s>, smoking and cursing to</s> argue.  <i>And this year, on the last day of CFP, we received more than 20 applications, it‚Äôs not necessary :-(</i> . To understand which reports we are ready to accept, and which regrets we will have to postpone, we spend a lot of time and nerve cells. This year almost 90 applications! I even wrote a <a href="https://medium.com/%40bunopus/a-few-words-about-holyjs-82540334a94c">post</a> on this topic.After the final formation of the program (more about this in another <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/company/jugru/blog/343454/">post</a> on Habr√©) comes the turn of the training, and then the conference itself. <br><br>  And sometimes there are <s>fakapy</s> force majeure.  Three weeks before the conference, the arrival of Mathias Bynens failed for good reason.  Well, thank God there is <a href="https://twitter.com/rdvornov">Roma Dvornov</a> ! <br><blockquote>  - Roma, can you perform? <br>  - Well, in general, I did not plan to perform more this year, and there is little time <br>  - Well, please, everything is blazing, without you :-( <br>  - ... <br>  - Hello, I am Roma Dvornov, and I did not have time to prepare, so I have only 150 slides <br></blockquote><br><h3>  Trainings </h3><br>  Boring to read.  Calls <br><br><hr><br><h1>  The conference.  The first day </h1><br>  It must be said that the conference for listeners is just an earthly paradise compared to how the organizers see it.  I remember those times when I could sit quietly in the hall and listen to the reports.  Oh, how good it was.  But be that as it may, conferences are like a restaurant.  Let everything on fire - the waiters should be in white shirts and smile.  To be honest, we have almost nothing burned, so a couple of changes in the grid. <br><br>  What we decided to try this year: the so-called MC.  This is when someone announces the speakers, with whom the one who is in the subject is desirable.  The reviews turned out to be good or bad, and the result was that I did not see anything except the first hall.  Well, except that coffee points.  So you have to write about the first hall.  <i>By the way, both days from the first hall was a free broadcast <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3DNs8eOF0Qd1U">day 1</a> , <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3DspIfirNCeVs">day 2</a></i> . <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/lt/e4/87/lte487s7tpnhnzk2dt2ocgeiacq.jpeg"><br>  <sub>Opened the Douglas Crockford conference with The Post JavaScript Apocalypse talk</sub> <br><br>  By the way, if you ever communicate with him - he is <b>a</b> voice.  As you can see in the video, I shoved the ad on Misha, so as not to be mistaken.  What can I say - Mr. Crockford, of course, value.  However, he is quite skeptical of JS, in which I understand him <sub>ave Dart!</sub>  .  After the report, a young man approached him and said with delight: <br><br><blockquote>  ‚ÄúThank you, Mr. Crockford, you have done so much!‚Äù <br>  - ...? <br>  - You opened the world of JavaScript for me, and now I am a junior fronder! <br>  - Oh, i'm so sorry ... <br></blockquote><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/em/qw/dm/emqwdm1y2lrlq7hdzzdm4e5dglm.jpeg"><br>  <sub>Minko Gechev, Faster Angular applications</sub> <br><br>  My beloved Minko talked about Angular.  And that's strange, I know for sure that many are engaged in Angulyar.  But this, apparently, is a very shameful occupation, because there were not so many people in the hall.  And the second oddity, despite what Minko said about quite interesting things (how to disperse the Angular), in the chat, reviews slid: "a little hardcore", "boredom". <br><br><hr><br><h4>  A little bit about hardcore </h4><br>  From year to year we get feedback ‚Äúwe need more complexity!‚Äù, ‚ÄúNot enough burn!‚Äù.  And we try to add complex topics, but at each conference there is one for whom there is little.  Here's a paradox: often hardcore reports get a not very high average score.  And what should we do here?  <sub>rhetorical question, but I would have discussed in the comments</sub> .  On the one hand, I want the conference to be interesting for both experienced specialists and juniors.  And on the other - every review is important, so sometimes it is very difficult for us to understand which reports are interesting for the audience. <br><br><hr><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/kp/lo/hy/kplohyqkhhpjqkn2bkm8vh4umrq.jpeg"><br>  <sub>Alexey Bogachuk.</sub>  <sub>Security: your application's vulnerabilities</sub> <br><br>  The speaker is the most unfortunate person at the conference <sub>after the organizers</sub> .  If you tell hardcore things, they will say ‚Äúboring‚Äù.  Simple things - "water".  So, not everyone can walk between Scylla and Charybdis.  It seems to be XSS - this is already known and understood by everyone.  But no, Alexey showed that everything is not so simple. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/_x/a2/w9/_xa2w9lpdwevotv0fqxisocuega.jpeg"><br>  <sub>Vitaly Slobodin Headless browsers: what, how and why</sub> <br><br>  Vitali is the person who closed (and first developed) PhantomJS.  And I had a wedge on his ad: the fact is that Vitaly‚Äôs last name is Slobod <b>and</b> n, and he doesn‚Äôt like it when the emphasis is put on the wrong letter.  I tried to joke that ‚ÄúIf you want to offend Vitali, call him Slob <b>o</b> Dean,‚Äù but in the middle of the phrase I forgot how to properly: facepalm :.  And the report was good. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/0z/p6/ma/0zp6malyvxcqfa9-frb_rsrlidq.jpeg"><br>  <sub>Nikolay Matvienko.</sub>  <sub>Troubleshooting Node.js Applications Under the Hood</sub> <br><br>  Returning to the topic of "hardcore."  Here it was in full.  I was still afraid that the audience had steam coming out of their ears.  Apparently Kohl was bitten by Vova Dashukevich, so he drove the horses :-).  But in terms of complexity, no one objected - it was a really cool performance. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/5h/ir/k1/5hirk17r5ps-to0hhlbwzutj5yw.jpeg"><br>  <sub>Vitaly Friedman.</sub>  <sub>New Adventures in Responsive Web Design</sub> <br><br>  <i>Charisma (from ancient Greek œáŒ¨œÅŒπœÉŒºŒ± - a gift (from God) - ‚Äúanointing‚Äù) - a special talent, the exclusiveness of the individual in an intellectual, spiritual, or some other respect, the ability to appeal to hearts</i> . <br><br>  Vitali gave a real show, threw candies, changed the report on the go, and in general was just a hall hero.  Humanity!  However, not everyone appreciated: <br><blockquote> ... <br>  as if everything is super, but I want to see more about JS and less populism <br>  ... <br>  you can still call Leps ;-) so that no one will be hurt directly.  I, of course, look forward to the conference about JS, in keyout top topics about JS.  Because I, as a JS developer, have nowhere to go from the keyout.  If Friedman stood in parallel, then there are no questions. <br></blockquote><br>  What do you want to answer this: Guys, keyouts have always been (and always will be most likely) the most motivating reports.  We are trying to invite the best speakers to them.  Yes, they can be called ‚Äúpopulist‚Äù, or they can be called ‚Äúmind-changing.‚Äù  In the end, if the cherry on the cake is also made of cream, it will be tasteless, is not it? <br><br><h3>  Afterparty and on </h3><br>  Wow, that was the heat.  By the way, the video can also be <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3DqLHrH4iaLng">viewed</a> .  The guys and I prepared contests and prizes, and the friendly podcasts <a href="http://frontendweekend.ml/">Frontend Weekend</a> and <a href="http://frontendweekend.ml/">Frontend</a> <a href="http://youknow.st/">Youth</a> were recording right on the stage.  We suggested to the audience to guess, ‚ÄúWhat kind of language is this?‚Äù By several lines of code.  Including such exotics as PureScript, Closure and even Dart!  Only when we were preparing contests, we did not expect that the audience would be so savvy.  All languages ‚Äã‚Äãwere guessed without prompts, although perhaps people just shouted out loud all the languages ‚Äã‚Äãthat they know.  ¬Ø \ _ („ÉÑ) _ / ¬Ø <br><br>  And then the action smoothly moved to the after-after party, but that's another story ... <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/tz/sv/m4/tzsvm4he_6ln6pdvwtgsutemx9c.jpeg"><br>  <sub>Bar full of HolyJS.</sub>  <sub>Biathlon fans huddled in the corners and quickly ran out</sub> <br><br><hr><br><h2>  Second day </h2><br>  A couple of days before the conference, another <i>force majeure</i> occurred, Martin Split fell ill.  The golden rule: do not know what to do - make a socket.  So we were looking for speakers who would lead a panel discussion, and I sat down at the slides.  Therefore, the day was like a fog (and not because of the after-after party. Well, most likely not because of this). <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/d-/hj/j2/d-hjj2van4i7h3tgkaeiwodao5q.jpeg"><br>  <sub>Opening keynout: Azat Mardan.</sub>  <sub>You don't know node</sub> <br><br>  Quite a controversial report turned out.  Many found it too simple and actively poured their opinions into the chat.  By the way, it's funny that when Azat came there himself, the passions subsided.  Apparently it's hard to say nasty things in the face. <br><br><hr><br><h4>  And a little more about hardcore </h4><br>  Looking at foreign conferences one gets the feeling that there is a completely different culture in relation to the complexity of the report.  We have reports from the category of "introduction to technology" are taken extremely badly, at foreign conferences, this is completely normal.  On the other hand, it seems that we have furious reports - this is ok and ‚Äúlet's do it again!‚Äù, And in Europe and America - the lot of workshops.  It‚Äôs good or not, I don‚Äôt know, but I don‚Äôt think it means that we have a smarter or more skillful audience, apparently, it‚Äôs something else <br><br><hr><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/w9/oz/xf/w9ozxf8cbfylg7jufdcncnxo3da.jpeg"><br>  <sub>Anton Lobov.</sub>  <sub>TypeScript, or Why is it so difficult</sub> <br><br>  Well, here I, like a <i>Dart</i> fan, of course, tears flowed straight.  Finally, everyone will understand what it is TypeScript.  But, to my regret, Anton finished on a positive note.  Well, I can wait. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/l6/kv/h9/l6kvh9hlxlinlfklk3oigqi-fpw.jpeg"><br>  <sub>Douglas Crockford.</sub>  <sub>Managing Asynchronicity with RQ</sub> <br><br>  Generally with Douglas Crockford is not so easy to communicate.  And not because of the language, but because there are not so many topics that interest him.  Therefore, the usual <i>small talks</i> about the weather do not roll.  And to think on the second day oh, how difficult.  But nothing, we sort of coped. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/aw/ss/0n/awss0n01gydxzs6el7zosa2th7q.jpeg"><br>  <sub>Pavel Chertorogov.</sub>  <sub>GraphQL - we conclude a profitable contract between the server and the client</sub> <br><br><blockquote>  - Pasha, how best to present you? <br>  - ... <br></blockquote><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/0y/s4/qg/0ys4qgllzdigh2ctmlysktglwwu.jpeg"><br>  <sub>Well, at least he put the emphasis</sub> <br><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Transfer</b> <div class="spoiler_text"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/aa/bf/ok/aabfokussg9ltkaivir1brczdji.jpeg"></div></div><br>  I have one question, why are there so many s in Kazakh? <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/z5/d3/o9/z5d3o9fk_z3d5a4_wea9fitswja.png"><br>  <sub>This is my best slide from the panel discussion.</sub>  <sub>Put a lot of work</sub> <br><br>  We invited Andrei Melikhov, Vova Dashukevich, Kohl Matvienko and Denis Mishunov to the panel discussion.  The topic came up with such that JS is everywhere now, but is it good?  Is it worth it to shove it everywhere?  Maybe this is bad?  We talked on the whole constructively, the audience turned on, even a few jokes went.  We talked about schoolchildren <sub>where without them</sub> , and about industry expertise.  In general, the conclusions were the following: write well, develop, and the language will be your tool, not a leader. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/dt/3f/qq/dt3fqqw_mvoey8lo4s1oanektew.jpeg"><br>  <sub>Lea Verou.</sub>  <sub>/ Reg (exp) {2} lained /: Demystifying Regular Expressions</sub> <br><br>  Here I frankly bungled, as I made slides for closing.  We came up with such a thing that it was possible to put a special hashtag on Twitter, add the name and top speaker, we will definitely send to the next conference.  Therefore, we tried and wrote an unreal code that would take tweets, counted the speakers, and the author of a random tweet would receive a ticket to the next HolyJS.  And we did write it!  I'll even <a href="https://jsbin.com/docazuvase/edit%3Fjs,console">show</a> it to <a href="https://jsbin.com/docazuvase/edit%3Fjs,console">you.</a>  Now you understand the power of the PC of the largest JS conference?  In four hands, we wrote this whole report!  :-) <br><br>  By the way, it is very nice that someone entered my name, very grateful.  And the winners of the speakers were Alexei Bogachuk and Vitaly Friedman.  We will definitely call them.  A random tweet search machine selected <a href="https://twitter.com/titovmx/status/940218062724390912">this tweet</a> . <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/ay/-l/4x/ay-l4x_eutxcfmvjholw0xu3f7q.jpeg"><br>  <sub>That's all</sub> <br><br><h1>  Results </h1><br>  As for me, a great conference turned out.  Yes, it was hard sometimes, but the trend is that each subsequent iteration is better than the previous one.  What action items I wrote myself: <br><br><ul><li>  To sleep more </li><li>  More cool reports and speakers.  Think about what to do with hardcore.  Maybe make a separate mini room for the furious hardcore?  In principle, on the third day there was an excellent workshop from <a href="https://twitter.com/mishunov">Denis Mishunov</a> , maybe some day of the workshops could be done? </li><li>  More interesting contests from sponsors.  This time there were both super cool things and ‚Äúproblems on a piece of paper‚Äù that raised questions </li><li>  Provide more networking opportunities.  In addition to reports, this is the second most important thing at the conference.  There are ideas to do some kind of application, where you can see the participants, what is interesting for them and, for example, write to them in a personal.  Or some qr codes on the badge.  In general, a lot of ideas, we must do </li></ul><br>  And, of course, many thanks to everyone who came, without you there would be nothing of this!  Realistically. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/344848/">https://habr.com/ru/post/344848/</a></p>
