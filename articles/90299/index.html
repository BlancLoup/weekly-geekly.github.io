      Let's start today, moving away a little from our direct subject, with impressions from the player that caught my attention. <br><br>  <b>Asus O! Play</b> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/4a4/098/484/4a409848425b7a9a08a0572676b73a2e.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  ASUSTeK, widely known to users for high-quality motherboards and laptops, presented a somewhat unexpected product to the public - the Asus O! Play media player.  We are just beginning to get used to HD-players, but at this time Asus teaches us to even more thoughtful players.  After all, the main feature of the novelty is the absence of a built-in drive.  At first glance, this may seem like a disadvantage for users who do not have their own collection of files on external media.  But on the other hand, Asus gives us the opportunity to constantly increase our media library.  However, the dimensions of the player are tied to the size of the hard disk - 3.5 inches.  A box of this size will be quite expensive to carry with you, so this is more a product for home use. <br>  The box with no display and buttons, made of matte black plastic, and has all the possible connectors for connecting devices.  USB, eSATA, LAN - a full range of connectors will allow you to enjoy movies in HD quality, up to 1080p resolution.  But in addition to the external qualities of the player, of course, it is worth noting the work of programmers from Asus, who managed to create a convenient and intuitive player interface.  The menu, as well as the appearance of the player, is made in black tones with no eye-catching decorations.  When working with files, the novelty will also pleasantly surprise with its simply huge set of codecs.  The player supports almost all formats for playing movies, music and images, the lack of support for professional RAW format for images can be forgiven.  And the user can control all this world of media files with the help of a remote control.  Its shape is so comfortable that the remote fits in your hand just perfectly.  It has 24 buttons to control the player, and they are all quite large, so even the visually impaired can deal with the controls. <br>  Of course, such a device should not pass by the eyes of potential buyers of players. <br><br>  <b>16 and 24 GB of DDR3 RAM from Corsair.</b> <br><br>  The company Corsair, which currently leads the market for memory solutions for overclockers, sent its view and a different range of tasks.  Now Corsair delivers an incredible amount of DDR3 standard memory sets - 16 GB and 24 GB.  Moreover, the kits belong to the Dominator line, which indicates their high performance. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/190/5a1/b25/1905a1b25db51abf2fef4e5b02cef330.jpg" alt="image"><br>  CMP24GX3M6A1600C9 <br><br>  The set consists of six levels, the volume of each of which is equal to 4 GB.  This solution can be used for the Intel X58 platform.  And for owners of platforms Inpel P55, Corsair reduced the number of slats in the kit to four, which allows you to get 16 GB.  The memory frequency was 1600 MHz with CL9 9-9-24 1N timings and 1.65 V voltage. The price of a 16 GB set is $ 1000, and for 24 GB, $ 1450. <br><br>  <b>The first mention of the motherboard Gigabyte GA-X58-UD9</b> <br><br>  This week, foreign overclockers have pleased the world community with the overclocking results of the Intel Core i7 980X on the motherboard - Gigabyte GA X58-UD9.  The new brainchild of Gigabyte is based on the Intel X58 chipset and should take the top line in the product range.  The hi-end class board, naturally, has good overclocker capabilities than the best public overclockers and have been praised for. <br><br>  The list of participants in the event consisted of guest stars: hicookie, youngpro, AndreYang, NickShih, dinos22, elmor. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/2a1/dd0/962/2a1dd0962c694c26bbe1b0bbda285756.png" alt="image"><br><br>  Participants of the event did not share photos of the board itself, but they reported the results in full. <br><br><img src="http://img576.imageshack.us/img576/4986/soc.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  <a href="">Zoom</a> <br><br>  29940 Marks in 3DMark Vantage was obtained using the video card Gigabyte HD5870 SOC (SuperOverClocked).  Overclocking really turned out crazy - 1480 MHz core.  Even at MSI Lightning, we did not see such frequencies. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/a0d/e39/183/a0de39183689a8c5ca499345635bb096.png" alt="image"><br><br>  The guys also confirmed that the new motherboard can perfectly overclock Intel Core i7 980X processors, setting a world record in the popular Super Pi32M benchmark.  The processor was overclocked to 6430 MHz. <br><br>  The results were very impressive, and we have to wait for photos of the board and more detailed tests. <br><br>  <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/occlub/blog/89307/">Issue 5</a> <br>  <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/occlub/blog/88232/">Release 4</a> <br>  <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/occlub/blog/87507/">Release 3</a> <br>  <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/occlub/blog/86763/">Release 2</a> <br>  <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/occlub/blog/85874/">Release 1</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/90299/">https://habr.com/ru/post/90299/</a></p>
