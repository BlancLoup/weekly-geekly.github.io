Let me remind you that KCS stands for knowledge-centered support and in the previous two articles I described in some detail what KCS is in general, where it was implemented in Russia and painted the main components of KCS.  I would like to devote the last final article on KCS to my vision on the problem of choosing software for this methodology. <br><br>  <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/post/270225/">Article number one</a> and <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/post/269267/">article number two</a> . <br><br><a name="habracut"></a>

    <h4>  Small excursion </h4><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/889/274/8e8/8892748e85da4e888287849d11555892.jpg"><br>  In fact, the topic of the choice of software can be completely bloated.  You can write about the selection criteria, make a basic review of these criteria.  Then each individual article to write about the most popular development, etc.  But for this you need to either be in the analytical department of one of the developers of such a program, or to be on the side of the customer who is actively preparing for implementation, or something else.  As I wrote in my postscript, I have nothing of that.  Therefore, the opinion will be in general, from other diverse experiences in IT and communication with colleagues who are engaged in this business. <br><br><h4>  Are you ready to introduce KCS? </h4><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/a44/d30/bac/a44d30bac6ed4172a46290d90beb8015.jpg" align="left"><br>  First and foremost, what I wanted to draw attention to is the organization‚Äôs readiness to introduce this class of systems.  Moreover, this readiness is not expressed only by the desire of one person and the availability of the budget for implementation, but is manifested precisely by the readiness of the organization as a whole to carry out full-scale work on many fronts of your business processes.  How can this be verified?  See these points: <br><br><ul><li>  The company has an understanding of how KCS methodology can improve its business processes; </li><li>  Support for the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãleadership and the ability to secure the person in charge; </li><li>  Willingness to change corporate culture, values ‚Äã‚Äãand indicators quickly enough; </li><li>  The presence in different departments and at different levels of the company of people who are ready to introduce new processes and adopt a new culture (albeit few, but they are needed); </li><li>  Willingness to reduce performance requirements at the time of implementing knowledge management. </li></ul><br><br>  Those.  if there is no readiness for implementation, then you should first carry out this preparatory work and only later deal with the choice of software. <br><br><h4>  Where to look for software </h4><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/ec9/d4d/675/ec9d4d675b7b49778650d0385b2a78de.jpg"><br>  Suppose that an organization is ready for such changes, the top management approved, supported and showed willingness to make changes in the minds of employees and spend a little or a lot of money on this matter, then a natural question arises.  And what software to choose?  Which vendor is better, etc. <br>  Since advertising is not welcome at Habr√©, I will not give collections with links.  Everything is perfectly googled.  Marketing and SEO also works for those who are engaged in this field.  I will share just <a href="http://www.thekcsacademy.net/tools/verified-tools/">one reference to vendors</a> that are recommended directly by the consortium.  However, it is worth noting that not a single domestic supplier is represented there (and they are there!), But now it seems as if <s>it is fashionable to</s> use the quality software more economically and economically.  Well, patriotic too;) <br><br><h4>  Instead of the total </h4><br>  That's all I wanted to write.  I wanted to convey only the idea that the software is secondary.  Initially, the desire to change something in the organization and availability of opportunities. <br><br>  ps I would be happy to write more on this topic, but unfortunately, the practical experience I have gained here is insignificant, and now I'm busy in a completely different area.  If you would like to learn more about KCS from a more practical point of view, please write about it in the comments and answer a simple survey.  Moreover, it is desirable to indicate in the comments which questions you would like to work out and which problems you care about.  With a significant response, I will contact my colleagues who continue to work in this area, and we will definitely figure out how and in what format to write about this topic on Habr√©. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/307110/">https://habr.com/ru/post/307110/</a></p>
