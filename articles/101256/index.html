The eye has a complex system of adjustment-accommodation, which allows you to quickly and imperceptibly move from a distant view to looking at the smallest objects close. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h4>  Introduction </h4><br>  The first threat to eyesight was universal literacy.  Humanity is buried in books, newspapers, accounts and statements.  Far vision more and more often turned out to be unnecessary, the mechanism of accommodation weakened, the first young spectacles appeared.  The second catastrophic eye war was almost universal computerization. <br><br>  The problem is this: many of us spend up to 8 hours a day in front of a computer, at work, at home or in a gaming club.  Even this material you are reading right now, looking at the monitor.  And it all starts extremely harmless - with the usual tired eyes ...

      Binocular vision is not necessary for the perception of a flat image.  The central nervous system instantly adapts to the situation when it is irrational to work with two eyes.  This phenomenon was confirmed by photographing the eyes of PC operators.  It turned out that by the end of the shift in one eye, the lens becomes more convex, the pupil narrowed, and the axis of the eyeball is turned slightly inward - that is, one eye is working hard.  And the other is not involved in the work at all. <br><br>  All this tells us, my friends, that they are simply turning off the eye. <br><br><h4>  Symptoms </h4><br>  How to determine that our eyes are overworked?  How to warn the worst? <br><br>  There are several ways: <br><br>  ‚Ä¢ Redness of the mucous <br>  ‚Ä¢ Pain in the eye area <br>  ‚Ä¢ Visual disturbances (veil, double vision) <br>  ‚Ä¢ Teariness or dry eyes <br>  ‚Ä¢ Syndrome of pseudo presence in the eye of a foreign object <br><br><h5>  Blink or not? </h5><br>  I am more than sure that about 55% of users, if not more, when they are focused on performing a task on a computer, forget to blink.  Think it wrong?  When I started to take special care of myself, I literally had to force myself to blink, because when you blink, your eyes become moist and clear, which contributes to clear vision.  The muscles of the face and forehead also relax, you do not wrinkle your forehead and do not feel the tension. <br><br>  If you blink infrequently, it contributes to red eyes, burning, itching and the effect of ‚Äúsand in the eyes‚Äù, especially for those who wear contact lenses.  All this is due to the fact that the mucous membrane of the eyes, which acts as a lubricant, dries pretty quickly. <br><br>  Learn to blink properly.  Make sure your forehead is relaxed.  Blink regularly every 3-5 seconds. <br><br><h4>  Correct installation and configuration of the monitor </h4><br>  Here everything is trite, everyone said and known a thousand times.  But since users do not really comply with the well-known requirements, I think it would not be superfluous to recall them: <br><br>  1. The recommended minimum distance to the eyes is 1-1.5 diagonal display. <br>  2. The center of the monitor should be (10-15 cm) below eye level. <br>  3. The monitor brightness should be muted, i.e.  a little darker than you think is normal. <br>  4. The light from the desk lamp should not fall between you and the monitor - this distracts peripheral vision, ideally the monitor should stand next to the wall, which will be illuminated by a lamp of preferably bluish color with a brightness approximately equal to the brightness of the screen.  Make sure the light does not fall on the screen. <br><br>  You should also avoid large contrast between the brightness of the screen and the surrounding space.  In no case should not work with a computer in a dark or dim room. <br><br>  Your vision must be ‚Äúopen.‚Äù  This means that, looking at the screen, you should see the objects around you - the table, the walls, the people sitting next to you, etc. Pay more attention to what you see with your peripheral vision - this will significantly reduce visual stress, physical and mental fatigue. .  When you look at an object, while not forgetting to see what is located to the left and right of it, the field of peripheral vision gradually expands. <br><br><h4>  Prevention </h4><br>  There are many tips, but the most optimal of them are the following four rules: <br><br>  1) Do not wait for the pain in the eyes - it is better <b>to take short breaks regularly</b> . <br><br>  It is widely believed that a 5-minute break in work every hour gives your eyes enough rest - <u>this is not so</u> !  Short visual breaks every 2-3 minutes more efficient and useful, and in the amount of time they take less.  It is recommended to do 3 switching focus from the near to the far object, it helps to relax the muscles of the eye. <br><br>  2) Firmly <b>squeeze your eyes tightly for 3-5 seconds</b> , and then open them wide for 3-5 seconds.  Repeat 6-8 times.  This exercise strengthens the muscles of the eyelids, improves blood circulation. <br><br>  3) Place your thumb at a distance of 25-30 cm from your eyes.  <b>Look with two eyes on the end of your finger for 3-5 seconds</b> , close one eye for 3-5 seconds, then look again with two eyes, then close the other eye.  Repeat several times.  Exercise strengthens the muscles of the eyes. <br><br>  4) <b>Rotations</b> .  Moreover, all possible: circular, sideways, up and down. <br><br>  5) There are a huge number of programs that after a certain period of time (usually 30-45 minutes) offer to conduct exercises for the eyes.  Such programs, on an amateur, I did not have enough patience - deleted. <br><br><h4>  Conclusion </h4><br>  The eyes are one of the most important organs in a person, a lot depends on him, in particular the usefulness of our life.  Vision can be easily lost, but it is unlikely to be restored. <br><br>  Watch your eyesight! </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/101256/">https://habr.com/ru/post/101256/</a></p>
