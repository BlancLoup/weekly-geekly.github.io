Well, we meet a selection of test bench for obtaining uncompromising performance in all categories, from air cooling to liquid nitrogen. <br> <a href="http://img27.imageshack.us/my.php%3Fimage%3D89486704.jpg"><img src="http://img27.imageshack.us/img27/8342/89486704.jpg" alt="Free Image Hosting at www.ImageShack.us"></a> <br>  TRAFFIC !!! <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  Everything in our world flows and changes.  There is a change of one leader by another.  So in the world of computer hardware, especially overclocking iron.  For example, the change in the leader of the manufacturer of the fastest desktop processors occurred when Intel in 2006 (if my memory serves me) released its long-awaited Core generation processors.  Then it immediately became clear that the Core2 Duo processors are simply out of competition, both in terms of performance and in terms of heat generation.  Also, the increase in performance almost linearly increased with an increase in the core frequency, which is not to say about the generation of Netburst (Pentium4), where a lot of memory performance hung.  This was followed by a decrease in the process, an increase in the cache, etc.  Generally speaking, everything is as usual: we are improving what has proven itself well, up to the need for the release of a new architecture.  And the next architecture was Corer i7.  Where for the first time the company used the built-in 3-channel memory controller DDR-III, and also, not for the first time for itself, a third-level cache.  And the unexpected thing is that AMD releases a fairly successful and competitive processor of the PhenomII series.  True, they were competitive only in extreme conditions, i.e.  in a situation with extreme overclocking, using liquid nitrogen (-196s), which could not but rejoice many extreme-extreme.  After all, the stand on the PhenomII processor is much cheaper than its competitor.  Soon, Intel put a bullet on the market for high-performance desktops, moving its Corei7 to an ultra-slim 32nm process technology.  The processor turned out to be 6 nuclear, radically better accelerated, very productive everywhere and expensive. <br><br>  And now about the fact that the processors are just a piece of silicon.  Well, we meet a selection of test bench for obtaining uncompromising performance in all categories, from air cooling to liquid nitrogen.

      Setup: <br>  <b><i>- Intel Corei7 980X</i></b> <b><i><br></i></b>  <b><i>- Cooler Thermaltake FRIO</i></b> <b><i><br></i></b>  <b><i>- GIGABYTE X58A-UD9</i></b> <b><i><br></i></b>  <b><i>- Corsair DOMINATOR GTX2</i></b> <b><i><br></i></b>  <b><i>- GIGABYTE HD5870 SuperOverClock</i></b> <b><i><br></i></b>  <b><i>- SSD ADATA 128Gb 500-series</i></b> <b><i><br></i></b>  <b><i>- PSU Thermaltake Toughpower Grand 750W</i></b> <b><i><br></i></b>  <b><i>- Glass for LN2 MiniGUN by DeDaL</i></b> <b><i><br></i></b> <br><br>  And now, about each piece of iron a little more in detail. <br><br>  1. Cooler <b>Thermaltake FRIO</b> <br><br> <a href="http://img532.imageshack.us/my.php%3Fimage%3Ddsc0239e.jpg"><img src="http://img532.imageshack.us/img532/8624/dsc0239e.jpg" alt="Free Image Hosting at www.ImageShack.us"></a> <br><br> <a href="http://img97.imageshack.us/my.php%3Fimage%3Ddsc0206i.jpg"><img src="http://img97.imageshack.us/img97/8136/dsc0206i.jpg" alt="Free Image Hosting at www.ImageShack.us"></a> <br><br> <a href="http://img188.imageshack.us/my.php%3Fimage%3Ddsc0247sm.jpg"><img src="http://img188.imageshack.us/img188/2816/dsc0247sm.jpg" alt="Free Image Hosting at www.ImageShack.us"></a> <br><br>  - undoubtedly one of the best supercoolers for today.  Attracts with its stylish appearance and high quality cooling even the hottest ‚Äústones‚Äù.  Equipped with two fans at once (for blowing and blowing) with regulation of each revolutions separately from ~ 1200 to 2500 rpm, which will give an opportunity to choose the optimal ratio of cooling / noise.  In practice, even the minimum 1200-1300 rev / min is quite enough for high-quality cooling, while the fans are quite high-quality, and it will be difficult to hear their work.  Among the shortcomings I can point out not the smallest overall height, i.e.  There is a very small chance that it may not fit into a small case. <br><br>  2. <b>GIGABYTE X58A-UD9</b> - perhaps the most sophisticated motherboard to date from those that you can buy. <br> <a href="http://img822.imageshack.us/my.php%3Fimage%3Dimg7339b.jpg"><img src="http://img822.imageshack.us/img822/2193/img7339b.jpg" alt="Free Image Hosting at www.ImageShack.us"></a> <br><br>  It has literally everything, just can not cook :).  For overclockers, it is interesting primarily because of the very high-quality CPU power supply circuit that can withstand loads in any conditions.  There is even a specially dedicated video where almost 1500Watt of electricity was transmitted via a UD9 socket in lab conditions <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3DYsFG0Pv-7bM">www.youtube.com/watch?v=YsFG0Pv-7bM</a> . <br><br> <a href="http://img693.imageshack.us/my.php%3Fimage%3Dimg73398.jpg"><img src="http://img693.imageshack.us/img693/8062/img73398.jpg" alt="Free Image Hosting at www.ImageShack.us"></a> <br><br>  Equipped with 7 PCI-E slots and two NVIDIA NF200 chips for the ability to organize 3-WAY / 4-WAY SLI / CrossFireX.  Well, the fact that there are USB3.0 and SATA-III controllers on it is not worth thinking of.  As mentioned above, it has everything for all cases, and it does not matter what to do with it. <br>  But like everything else in our imperfect world, and such a motherboard has its drawbacks.  Firstly, the presence of 7 PCI-E slots did not pass unnoticed, but it increased the size of the board very significantly.  And to tell the truth, there are too few shells on the market where she could fit without using the ‚Äúself-turner‚Äù operation.  The presence of two hot NF200 chips adversely affects the final cost and heating of the board as a whole.  And there are few users who decided to install 4 video cards at once. <br>  But for an overclocker who needs performance, flexibility, versatility and stability in the work, the above listed disadvantages are not disadvantages. <br><br>  3. <b>Corsair DOMINATOR GTX2</b> - this model is sold by the piece.  Pre-selected in the most demanding conditions, based on the most promising chips Elpida Hyper.  Allows you to work in the modes: low timings and low frequency, high timings and high frequency. <br>  Those.  here you choose which mode is more optimal for you in terms of performance. <br>  The nominal operating frequency is 2250 MHz with 8-8-8-24 timings with 1.65V power. <br>  Of the shortcomings, we can only note the price, but for all the good, as they say ... <br><br> <a href="http://img85.imageshack.us/my.php%3Fimage%3Ddsc0591zs.jpg"><img src="http://img85.imageshack.us/img85/2089/dsc0591zs.jpg" alt="Free Image Hosting at www.ImageShack.us"></a> <br><br> <a href="http://img28.imageshack.us/my.php%3Fimage%3Ddsc0592m.jpg"><img src="http://img28.imageshack.us/img28/306/dsc0592m.jpg" alt="Free Image Hosting at www.ImageShack.us"></a> <br><br>  4. <b>GIGABYTE HD5870 Super OverClock</b> - the model on the well-proven Cypress chip, is distinguished by a radically improved power supply circuit of both the video chip and the memory modules.  It has the highest, in comparison with the others, high initial core frequency - 950 MHz. <br><br> <a href="http://img822.imageshack.us/my.php%3Fimage%3Ddsc0549.jpg"><img src="http://img822.imageshack.us/img822/6430/dsc0549.jpg" alt="Free Image Hosting at www.ImageShack.us"></a> <br><br>  Cooling system <br> <a href="http://img686.imageshack.us/my.php%3Fimage%3Ddsc0559f.jpg"><img src="http://img686.imageshack.us/img686/4431/dsc0559f.jpg" alt="Free Image Hosting at www.ImageShack.us"></a> <br><br>  A high-quality power converter is responsible for powering the video chip. <br><br> <a href="http://img411.imageshack.us/my.php%3Fimage%3Ddsc0561qn.jpg"><img src="http://img411.imageshack.us/img411/4679/dsc0561qn.jpg" alt="Free Image Hosting at www.ImageShack.us"></a> <br><br>  A feature of which is specially developed by NEC / Tokin.  Proadlizer (decoupling capacitor) NEC / TokinOE907, designed for voltages up to (2.5V) and a capacity of 900 ŒºF.  This makes it possible to provide the GPU with a very large current without interference.  There are 4 of them on the GPU and one for memory. <br> <a href="http://img341.imageshack.us/my.php%3Fimage%3Ddsc0568a.jpg"><img src="http://img341.imageshack.us/img341/4796/dsc0568a.jpg" alt="Free Image Hosting at www.ImageShack.us"></a> <br><br> <a href="http://img9.imageshack.us/my.php%3Fimage%3Ddsc0569k.jpg"><img src="http://img9.imageshack.us/img9/3220/dsc0569k.jpg" alt="Free Image Hosting at www.ImageShack.us"></a> <br><br>  Among the drawbacks, it is worth noting the noise level of the cooling system is higher than that of reference cards. <br><br>  5. <b>SSD ADATA 128Gb 500-series</b> <br> <a href="http://img8.imageshack.us/my.php%3Fimage%3Ddsc0544d.jpg"><img src="http://img8.imageshack.us/img8/2643/dsc0544d.jpg" alt="Free Image Hosting at www.ImageShack.us"></a> <br><br> <a href="http://img697.imageshack.us/my.php%3Fimage%3Ddsc0545yv.jpg"><img src="http://img697.imageshack.us/img697/3964/dsc0545yv.jpg" alt="Free Image Hosting at www.ImageShack.us"></a> <br><br> <a href="http://img411.imageshack.us/my.php%3Fimage%3Ddsc0547bt.jpg"><img src="http://img411.imageshack.us/img411/6409/dsc0547bt.jpg" alt="Free Image Hosting at www.ImageShack.us"></a> <br><br>  - one of the few carriers of this type that I was able to use.  This SSD has one very convenient option, namely the mini-USB connector, which makes it possible to use it in some cases as a fast ‚Äúbig USB flash drive‚Äù.  In addition to a high throughput speed, approximately twice the simple HDD, the SSD is disproportionately smaller, 0.13ms versus 8-13ms, access speed (tested in Everest v5.50).  It is aggressively low level of access time plays a significant role in the advantage of SSD.  All of this has a very positive effect on the OS boot speed, especially if there are 4 video cards on the stand at once and you often have to reboot the system during an extreme acceleration. <br>  The ADATA 128Gb 500-series SSD has an aluminum casing and there is even an indication of data stream activity (HDD LED), which can be very convenient if you have an open stand, and there is no such indicator on the motherboard. <br><br>  6. <b>PSU Thermaltake Toughpower Grand 750W</b> is a new model of the Toughpower series, which differs from the others by extremely low noise level and output pulsations, which is very important for stability during acceleration and durability of the entire bundle of the stand as a whole.  Tellingly, the manufacturer honestly declares that he has the same line + 12V / 60A.  One such PSU is more than enough for a system overclocking in air with two top single-chip video cards.  It has a very stylish look. <br>  As always, the blocks of this class have a modular structure, which gives additional convenience when using. <br><br> <a href="http://img28.imageshack.us/my.php%3Fimage%3Ddsc0597q.jpg"><img src="http://img28.imageshack.us/img28/2029/dsc0597q.jpg" alt="Free Image Hosting at www.ImageShack.us"></a> <br><br> <a href="http://img294.imageshack.us/my.php%3Fimage%3Ddsc0602z.jpg"><img src="http://img294.imageshack.us/img294/1332/dsc0602z.jpg" alt="Free Image Hosting at www.ImageShack.us"></a> <br><br> <a href="http://img294.imageshack.us/my.php%3Fimage%3Ddsc0606m.jpg"><img src="http://img294.imageshack.us/img294/2958/dsc0606m.jpg" alt="Free Image Hosting at www.ImageShack.us"></a> <br><br> <a href="http://img267.imageshack.us/my.php%3Fimage%3Ddsc0607d.jpg"><img src="http://img267.imageshack.us/img267/1532/dsc0607d.jpg" alt="Free Image Hosting at www.ImageShack.us"></a> <br><br>  7. <b>Glass for LN2 - MiniGUN by DeDaL</b> - well, and finally, what kind of overclocker doesn't like fast processors?).  After all, to maximize the potential of the processor, can not do without good cooling, namely, extreme, using liquid nitrogen. <br> <a href="http://img689.imageshack.us/my.php%3Fimage%3Ddsc0609z.jpg"><img src="http://img689.imageshack.us/img689/7236/dsc0609z.jpg" alt="Free Image Hosting at www.ImageShack.us"></a> <br><br>  A glass of MiniGUN, was designed for the most advanced processors where simplicity in temperature control is required.  After all, not all processors, like AMD Phenom II, can operate at temperatures close to (-196s) - for example, we have a processor capable of functioning normally at (-130s) and allocating more than 300Watt of heat (about as much as Intel Corei7 980X at voltage 1.75V power supply in multi line mode).  It is very important to maintain the temperature convenience. <br><br> <a href="http://img34.imageshack.us/my.php%3Fimage%3Ddsc0617iw.jpg"><img src="http://img34.imageshack.us/img34/3507/dsc0617iw.jpg" alt="Free Image Hosting at www.ImageShack.us"></a> <br><br> <a href="http://img171.imageshack.us/my.php%3Fimage%3Ddsc0621a.jpg"><img src="http://img171.imageshack.us/img171/5156/dsc0621a.jpg" alt="Free Image Hosting at www.ImageShack.us"></a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/97008/">https://habr.com/ru/post/97008/</a></p>
