  <section class="page js-page"><h1>LLC registration is ‚Äúone window‚Äù. Nuances</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  So, we will analyze in part the registration of a company on the example of a limited liability company (LLC) on a simplified taxation system.  I will not go into details, descriptions of this process can be found, but some of the nuances can be learned only from his, damn, life experience.  More details: <br>  It is necessary to submit documents to the Federal Tax Service ‚Ññ 46 (list of documents in Yandex).  My advice - sign up for submission, find out the phone (www.n46.ru) and sign up.  You will save a lot of time and nerves. <br>  In a week, you will be given documents in the composition: 2 certificates, copies of the charter and memorandum of association, something else, and here the most interesting begins. <br><br><h4>  Go! </h4><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Actually, we have a <b>‚Äúone window‚Äù system</b> , which means: you are registered, and the 46th tax must notify: Rosstat, FSS (Social Insurance Fund), FIU (Pension Fund of Russia), MGFOM (Moscow City Mandatory Medical Insurance Fund) , district tax inspectorate (Inspectorate of the Federal Tax Service).  You only need to open an account with an extra effort.  But actually‚Ä¶ <br><br><h5>  Rosstat </h5><br>  In the 46 documents issued by the Federal Tax Service there were no statistics codes (a month ago a friend registered an LLC - the Rosstat page was issued automatically).  You need to go to Rosstat after 7-8 days after receiving the documents from the tax, do not try to go earlier, ‚Äúyou know how many you are‚Äù!

    <h5>  FSS </h5><br>  No notification has come from any of the funds, although they seem to be due.  So, FSS.  We go, we see that people are standing on the street - the queue is occupied.  We don‚Äôt want to stand, find out the website (promising super-functionality and online registration) of a special section of the fund, go to the Internet, register on the site, find out what you need to go.  We are going, but in the afternoon after lunch.  There are no people.  Many thanks to a man who looks like a security guard, who suggests that registration is in room no. (Really, thank you so much!).  Announcement of this nowhere.  Production occurs quickly and without problems, you only need to live to this point. <br><br><h5>  FIU </h5><br>  - Good afternoon, I would put the organization on record. <br>  - Yes, sit down, documents. <br>  - Here you are. <br>  - So, and power of attorney? <br>  - I'm the general. <br>  - So, and with the general, we ask for the original statement ... <br>  - Sorry, here are all constituent documents, stamp, passport - what do you need, in what quantity?  (in a whisper: ‚Äúwhat are you asking from the couriers?‚Äù). <br>  - Yes ... oh, I have no time to watch, "monitor-typing-print-hj-hj", here is your copy. <br>  - Thank you very much, all the best. <br><br><h5>  MGFOMS </h5><br>  - Copies of documents please. <br>  ‚ÄúOk, okay, but I need to make them.‚Äù <br>  - Go. <br>  At home, I received insider information: ‚ÄúWhy did they ask for the documents?  They throw them away ... ".  The next day. <br>  - Good afternoon, here are the documents. <br>  - exe, ‚Äúmonitor-typing-print-hj-hj‚Äù, here is your copy. <br>  - Thank you very much, all the best. <br><br><h5>  District IFSN </h5><br>  A separate story - the district tax.  First, you need to notify them <b>about opening a bank</b> account.  Secondly, from them to receive a <b>notice of permission to the USN</b> , if you are simplified. <br><br>  The first impression is: ‚Äúoh, how many ads have been added ... and how they have set up electronic reporting ... oh, I don‚Äôt understand anything about these ads.‚Äù Mmm ... office number number like. <br>  - Hello, how can I notify a tax account about opening a bank account for an organization? <br>  - Hello, the tax notice is in the form of a message - tells me a nice girl. <br>  - Sorry, what kind of message?  Is there a blank or something? <br>  - Tax notification is done in the form of a notification. <br>  - What?  Oral ??? <br>  - Very funny (viciously!). <br>  - ... !!! ....... ... !!!  - rushes in my head, which translates as: ‚Äúdear girl, you deign to give quite lengthy explanations, and I find them obscure‚Äù - I leave silently;  in the head one of the read announcements pops up: ‚ÄúInsulting an employee of the Federal Tax Service is an insult to the state.  official in the performance that threatens with a fine ... ‚Äù- I leave quickly. <br>  A call to a friend explained that there is a form, the tax must give it, it is filled in and given away - everything is simple.  I come back - turn - I call, I share indignation with a friend, I end the conversation, a man approaches (I heard my indignation): ‚ÄúYou know, go to the website of mosnalog.ru - everything is there‚Äù.  I go home, type, fill.  The next day: <br>  - Oh, you know, and what's the name of the guy of this blue-eyed guy? <br>  - Girl, sorry, here is the notice. <br>  - Yeah, uh, "monitor-hj-hj." <br>  - Everything? <br>  - Everything. <br>  - Thank. <br><br>  Secondly, the notice.  Cabinet ‚Ññ‚Ññ‚Ññ: <br>  - Good afternoon, I need to put the organization on the account in the district to put ... it seems something like that. <br>  - Documents. <br>  - Here you are. <br>  - Well, we have a new program, you call in a week. <br>  - Well thank you. <br>  In a week. <br>  - Good afternoon, check your company registration is worth it? <br>  - Inn? <br>  - ‚Ññ‚Ññ‚Ññ. <br>  - Yes, it is. <br>  - And ... (stand) how to get a notification about the USN? <br>  - And you do not? <br>  - Not.  Call, here's the phone, and I'll translate you now. <br>  - Thank you so much (just surprised!). <br><br>  - Hello, I have no notice. <br>  - And when did you register? <br>  And that there is no notice? <br>  And what are you sitting and waiting for? <br>  What is in the mail? <br>  Well, sit ... <br>  - Stop!  How to sit - I do not want any problems with the tax. <br>  - Yes?  Well, actually, you need to come and bring a statement to the USN tax. <br>  - I will be in 15 minutes. <br><br>  - Good afternoon, here is a copy of the application. <br>  - Oh, good. <br>  - When can I get a notification? <br>  - Oh, you know, we have a new program ... <br>  - I know. <br>  - Yes, and this program does not work with the simplified tax system. <br>  -?!?! <br>  - We will call you. <br>  - Thank you, I will really wait for the call, all the best (I am leaving quickly and quickly). <br><br>  Faking update ... <br>  - Here is your notice. <br>  - Thank you very much! <br>  - You now need to take copies to the funds. <br>  - How so?  I'm already standing in them ... <br>  - And how they put you, if you did not have permission for the USN? <br>  - I do not know‚Ä¶ <br>  A curtain. <br><br>  If everything happened to you, three funds are waiting for you again ... Welcome! <br>  The end of the update. <br><br><h5>  Bank account </h5><br>  Get ready to do a bunch of documents and notarize a bunch of notaries and leave a lot of money.  Get ready for a call from the security service and other pleasant things. <br><br><h5>  In the bottom line you should have: </h5><br>  from FTS 46: <br>  1. Certificate of state registration with OGRN. <br>  2. Certificate of registration with the tax authority with INN \ KPP. <br>  3. Information about registration in the Statregistre Rosstat. <br>  4. Extract from the Unified State Register of Legal Entities. <br>  5. A copy of the Charter (from the tax - it must be provided when submitting documents!). <br>  6. A copy of the Memorandum of Association (from the tax - it must be provided when submitting the documents!). <br>  7. Statement on the transition to a simplified tax system. <br>  8. Protocol No. 1 on the establishment and appointment and state registration. <br>  (9. Order No. 1 on the appointment of a general director and chief accountant). <br><br>  From the FSS - Registration Notice as a Policyholder with a Registration Number. <br><br>  From the FIU - Notice of registration with the territorial authority of the pension fund of the Russian Federation. <br><br>  From MGFOMS - Certificate of registration of the insured in the territorial fund of compulsory medical insurance with compulsory medical insurance. <br><br>  Bank documents: an agreement on opening an account, online banking and so on. <br><br>  You also need to employ yourself and conclude an employment contract and pay yourself a salary of at least 9000 rubles. <br><br>  You also need to agree with a company that would keep accounts, even simplified, but you still need to keep.  I will, of course, deal with it myself, but for the time being we always pay for ignorance - nobody canceled it (I thought and I really wouldn‚Äôt - no, I don‚Äôt have time for that, I‚Äôve got a way to earn money on accounting with what we can do). <br><br>  <b>Just.</b> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/52332/">https://habr.com/ru/post/52332/</a></p>
