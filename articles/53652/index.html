      As Twitter acquires the official status of the next "Web 2.0" phenomenon, the brains of the best Internet analysts are increasingly straining to find concepts for its further development and monetization. <br>  The most relevant rhetoric is now developing around the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãthe emergence on Twitter of a new paradigm of social search.  And everything connected with the search on the Internet, of course, directly concerns the universal fetish of recent years - Google. <br>  What is it about? <br><br>  1. It is assumed that a search on Twitter sooner or later will arouse the great interest of users - in fact, users can look for recommendations, feedback, opinions on any urgent and exciting issues.  For example, "Where is the cheapest Scotch whiskey in Manhattan" or "The better way to fly from Los Angeles to Washington - American Airlines or Aeroflot."  In this case, the user gets ideally unbiased reviews of real people on the topic of interest, and not a million pages with ads optimized for Google-search. <br><br>  2. Twitter search takes place in real time, unlike Google and other search engines that index content on a schedule.  And this is important when it comes to requests like ‚Äúwhether the traffic jam has resolved in Leningradka‚Äù.  In general - a dynamic search in the spirit of "what people are saying about what I'm looking for right now."  This is a "cool", no questions asked. <br><br>  3. In addition to the search itself, and this is probably even more important, the user can get an answer to his question in real time or for an adequate time (which he can ask himself) from colleagues competent in the question in question ‚Äî among millions of people (about 6 million and growing epidemically) the army of users will surely find owners of sacred knowledge about ‚Äúwhether it is worth ordering octopuses in Tangier or limit yourself to safe spinach.  Toko, let's go faster, or else the waiter is waiting ‚Äùor‚Äú Where to pee on 42nd Street? ‚Äù. <br><br>  I don‚Äôt know about you, but it seems to me that this use of Twitter really looks natural and comfortable.  The range of queries, both search and question-response, seems to be immense - and therefore it can also become ambitious. <br>  Needless to say that in a logical way there are temptations and, most importantly, opportunities for targeted contextual advertising.  And this is today the main patrimony and Google‚Äôs manger - about 65% of all search queries and about 75% of all contextual advertising dollars are biting off Google. <br><br>  Do you remember how Google bought YouTube in 2006 for $ 1.65 billion?  And remember - why?  True, simply because the volume of search queries to YouTube has grown so fast that it became clear that this will soon be a big chunk of the entire search market.  Google couldn't help but buy YouTube, even though it was clear (and then it proved to be the best) - to monetize the context on YouTube is much more difficult than on Google.com. <br>  However, strategically, apparently, there is nothing to be sorry for Google - the volume of search queries to YouTube now exceeds the search volume of the closest competitor of Yahoo.  And how profitable to monetize - Google will come up (for example, advertising in commercials) and implements sooner or later. <br><br>  Hence the question - will not the search engines fight for Twitter, and not the social network, as was supposed earlier?  In this light, Twitter‚Äôs rejection of a Facebook offer looks strategic.  Let me remind you that Evan Williams (Evan Williams, the founder of Twitter) has already sold Google a rather big business - Blogger. <br><br>  By the way, yesterday at the conference in Morgan Stanley, Eric Schmidt (Google CEO) <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/google-ceo-twitter-a-poor-mans-email-system-2009-3">called</a> Twitter ‚Äúan email for the poor‚Äù (‚ÄúSpeaking as a computer scientist, I‚Äôm email systems‚Äù).  Then he made <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/henry-blodget-google-2009-3">excuses</a> on CNBC that he was misunderstood, and Twitter and other guys like Facebook are good too, because users want to communicate in a variety of ways ... <br><br>  In addition to ‚Äúconceptually new search plus contextual advertising,‚Äù there are of course many other fantasies about monetizing Twitter. <br>  For example, the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãassigning a verified login to the user: most users want to know who they are actually subscribed to and be sure that if they are subscribed to <a href="http://geektimes.ru/users/putin/" class="user_link">putin</a> , then a lonely schoolboy from Nebraska is not fooling them. <br>  Well-known personalities and simply having a bunch of subscribers also understand that the audience will become bigger and more loyal if they confirm their authenticity and authenticity. <br>  For such a verification, you can take money, to confirm the self it is enough to use a personal credit card, for example. <br>  Not to mention corporate users - it‚Äôs a sin not to take it, otherwise you can register @ windows-help and post links to the ‚Äúlast update‚Äù of the necessary content or you can think of something yourself ... <br><br><img src="http://www.anti-site.ru/trash/celebsontwitter.jpg" alt="image"></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/53652/">https://habr.com/ru/post/53652/</a></p>
