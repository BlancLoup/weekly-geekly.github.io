I wonder how things are done.  It seems to me that most people are interested too. <br><br>  Historically, video games do not share source code.  Of course, they are intended for players.  But for programmers there is always something to look at.  And some games still released their source.  And I had long intended to make such a selection. <br><br>  Unfortunately, almost all games are for PC.  Finding sources for consoles or arcades is almost impossible, and most programmers are not aware of the differences in approaches to programs on platforms other than PCs.

      Many of the games after the release of the source have been improved and supplemented by the community - I deliberately give links only to the original source.  So, if you are suddenly interested in upgrades - they may exist. <br><br>  Many games have been reviewed on <a href="http://fabiensanglard.net/">the Fabien Sanglard website</a> .  If you are interested in the details of their work, then welcome to him. <br><br>  You may notice that many games belong to id Software / Apogee.  Coincidence?  I do not think.  id is famous for its openness and habit of releasing sources.  Old commercial games no longer have any value and would be lost - is it not better that someone learns something useful based on them? <br><br>  So let's get started (in chronological order): <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h4>  Colossal Cave Adventure (1976) </h4><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/c0e/f65/4b0/c0ef654b07f17e8929ef0e0867c58fc2.png" alt="image"><br><br>  Developer: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Crowther">William Crowther</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don_Woods_%2528programmer%2529">Don Woods</a> <br>  Publisher: Miscellaneous. <br>  Platform: PDP-10 and friends. <br><br>  ‚ÄúYou are in a maze of twisty little passages, all alike.‚Äù (‚ÄúYou are in a maze of small, winding passages indistinguishable from each other‚Äù). <br><br>  Perhaps this is not a 100% commercial game.  But it was sold, in addition, it has historical importance.  And, by the way, precisely based on the name of this game, all adventure games are called adventure. <br><br>  The original was written in Fortran, which will be difficult for modern programmers to understand.  But the latest versions were in C. <br><br>  Sources: <a href="http://rickadams.org/adventure/">rickadams.org/adventure</a> <br><br><h4>  Catacomb (1989) </h4><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/be0/f52/7d2/be0f527d2665a5bc2abc1c7d2790d925.png" alt="image"><br><br>  Developer: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Carmack">John Carmack</a> <br>  Publisher: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Softdisk">Softdisk</a> <br>  Platform: Apple II / DOS <br><br>  Do not confuse with Catacomb 3D.

The appearance clearly reminds us of the 90s and the VGA system, where the colors were chosen not for beauty, but from the standard DPaint palette. <br><br>  I recommend reading the review code from <a href="http://www.escapistmagazine.com/articles/view/video-games/goodoldreviews/12716-Good-Old-Review-Star-Control-2">The Escapist</a> . <br><br>  The source code was received from the port on 3D0, the original one was lost.

And it became more interesting to play.  As in most cases with the id company, the source code is relatively easy to read, although the key parts are written in a 16-bit assembler (you will not see this in Doom). <br><br>  It is interesting to note that for drawing vertical lines they dynamically generate different functions for each of the possible heights of the walls. <br><br>  At Fabien, you can find <a href="http://fabiensanglard.net/Compile_Like_Its_1992/">instructions on how to compile the source</a> for modern tools. <br><br>  Blake Stone, an offshoot from Apogee on the same engine, was released in 1993, a week before Doom.

At one time it was a revolution - the world from the first person, not flat, like Wolf3D.  Lighting, textures and deathMatch invention. <br><br>  One of the most iconic things was the invention of the ‚Äúengine‚Äù idea.  Before this game were strongly associated with the data.  Doom promoted the decoupling of game data from the engine.  This gave rise to entire communities that modified the game (Aliens TC, Fistful Of Doom). <br><br>  Sources: <a href="http://github.com/id-Software/DOOM">github.com/id-Software/DOOM</a> <br><br><h4>  Descent (1994) </h4><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/932/903/db6/932903db66f65ea4273638dd8fa9d9a6.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Developer: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parallax_Software">Parallax Software</a> <br>  Publisher: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interplay_Productions">Interplay Productions</a> <br>  Platform: DOS <br><br>  Many companies rushed to catch up with Doom, launching a wave of "Doom Clones."

Notable milestone in the creation of a fully three-dimensional engines, without any hacks like 2.5D <br><br>  I will mention some interesting details.  Perhaps this is the first commercial game compiled with an open source compiler (DJGPP for DOS, early gcc port). <br><br>  The game had its own scripting language ‚ÄúQuake C‚Äù (later on lcc for Quake 3).  It was built specifically to allow players to make modifications.  This, coupled with the PWAD resource system, gave rise to a huge community of modders. <br><br>  Quake 1 had an innovative shading results caching mechanism.  But after the spread of 3D accelerators, it lost its meaning.  The next game from id, Rage, used the same idea. <br><br>  In addition, Quake was a very reliable engine.  No raster glitches or collision calculations. <br><br>  Quake / Sources: <a href="http://github.com/id-Software/Quake">github.com/id-Software/Quake</a> <br>  Quake 2 / Sources: <a href="http://github.com/id-Software/Quake-2">github.com/id-Software/Quake-2</a> <br>  Quake 3 / Sources: <a href="http://github.com/id-Software/Quake-III-Arena">github.com/id-Software/Quake-III-Arena</a> <br><br><h4>  Abuse (1996) </h4><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/d50/365/675/d503656750b6f8e37ba5005a24e51fbd.gif" alt="image"><br><br>  Developer: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crack_dot_Com">Crack dot Com</a> <br>  Publisher: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronic_Arts">Electronic Arts</a> / <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Origin_Systems">Origin Systems</a> <br>  Platform: DOS / Linux / Mac <br><br>  I love Abuse. <br><br>  The game has used several innovations.  Cool control system at the same time with the mouse and keyboard.  Dynamic lighting (an unheard of thing for platformers). <br><br>  But most of all, as a programmer, I liked the ‚Äúvisual Lisp‚Äù system.  The whole game is scripted in a language resembling Lisp.  The behavior of enemies can be changed during the execution of the game, and not just included in the code. <br><br>  Another interesting point was the way in which events can be connected in the built-in map editor - visually drag lines from the switch to the door, or from a trap to the place where enemies appear.  There is an opportunity to set the logic AND / OR in the form of hidden objects on the level.  This I have not seen in other editors. <br><br>  The game did not earn commercial success, and in two years the source code was published.

But in his declining years, the situation begins to soften.  Still, it's nice to see that large companies come to more open views on things - all these developments have zero commercial value, they are only historically valuable. <br><br>  Last year, the source code for the earlier versions of MS-DOS and Word was even released, which was unheard of about 30 years ago. <br><br>  Sources: <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx%3FFamilyID%3D6d790cde-c3e5-46be-b3a5-729581269a9c%26DisplayLang%3Den">www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyID=6d790cde-c3e5-46be-b3a5-729581269a9c&amp;DisplayLang=en</a> <br><br><h4>  Doom 3 (2004) </h4><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/0e5/df8/e03/0e5df8e035493950310fb8b768b322f2.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Developer: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Id_Software">id Software</a> <br>  Publisher: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Activision">Activision</a> <br>  Platform: Windows / Mac / Linux / Xbox / PS3 <br>  Code review: <a href="http://fabiensanglard.net/doom3/index.php">fabiensanglard.net</a> <br><br>  If you want to explore the engines of modern high-end games, then Doom 3 is one of the best examples.  At the time of release, he was innovative in many areas.  The method of using high-resolution models on the elements of low resolution in the game is now the standard for commercial games.  The source has a lot of interesting things - only one physics processing system is worth exploring, in particular, collision tracking. <br><br>  This is the first game from id, written in C ++.  Past games due to the use of C carried the simplicity.  Doom 3 is also quite simple, but its movement vector change is already noticeable. <br><br>  Also, the game is (sadly) known for using stencil shadows when calculating lighting.  One can argue whether it was an interesting experiment or a field for further work, but today's games prefer to use shadow maps.  Perhaps this technique ever come in handy. <br><br>  An excellent <a href="http://fabiensanglard.net/doom3/index.php">review of the code from Fabien Anglard is</a> worth reading. <br><br>  Sources: <a href="http://github.com/id-Software/DOOM-3">github.com/id-Software/DOOM-3</a> <br>  BFG edition Sources: <a href="http://github.com/id-Software/DOOM-3-BFG">github.com/id-Software/DOOM-3-BFG</a> <br><br><h4>  Gish (2004) </h4><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/243/906/f7c/243906f7ca5719321c93ceb0fcaf8d96.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Developer: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php%3Ftitle%3DCryptic_Sea%26action%3Dedit%26redlink%3D1">Cryptic Sea</a> <br>  Publisher: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_Logic">Chronic Logic</a> / <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stardock">Stardock</a> <br>  Platform: Windows / Linux <br><br>  Gish was notable for soft-body physics and an interesting approach to time.  It is interesting to understand its source code and find out how it works.  There are no external physical engines here. <br><br>  Interestingly, the game is completely written in C - now it is rare.  This is not the tidiest source I've ever seen, but this is a good example of how a game may not turn into a giant sprawling code base with hundreds of external dependencies. <br><br>  Sources: <a href="">www.crypticsea.com/download/gishsource153.zip</a> <br><br><h4>  Canabalt (2009) </h4><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/97a/a51/58b/97aa5158beeff6caebd1d3ba38ed28ff.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Developer: Adam Saltsman <br>  Publisher: Semi-Secret / <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beatshapers">Beatshapers</a> / Kittehface <br>  Platform: Flash / iOS / PSP / Android / Ouya <br><br>  Not the most difficult game, so what?  If you want to learn how to make games, start with a simple one - just with this. <br><br>  Prototyping took 5 days, porting to iOS - 10. An example of turning a simple idea into a worthy expression.  This is like the return of the 8-bit era, when new genres could appear weekly.
