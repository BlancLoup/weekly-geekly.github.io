The opportunity to participate in it will be those projects that the jury will select in the qualifying events during the year. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/3ed/c00/ec0/3edc00ec0ff44d9d9111a64eb4329ecd.png"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  On June 27, 2015, in Kiev, our project took part in the <a href="http://pioneers.in.ua/">PioneersKyiv</a> international start-up competition, which was attended by investors, mentors and business angels from both Ukraine and abroad.  A prerequisite was to present your startup exclusively in English, as some members of the jury were residents of Austria.  Each team fought for its ‚Äúplace in the sun‚Äù and each prepared for the competition with full responsibility, <a href="http://2polyglot.com/%3Futm_source%3D2polyglot%26utm_medium%3DPR%26utm_campaign%3D2">2Polyglot was</a> no exception. <br><br>  Only three minutes were given to the participants to present their project and the same time was allocated to questions from the jury and guests of the event.  Everyone understands - this is very little.  But once again I want to focus attention here.  If you are preparing to perform anywhere, consider such a nuance and rehearse your speech well, fitting into the allotted timeline.

Further, according to the internal schedule, the jury members alternately made their very useful presentations.  First of all, I would like to mention the particularly exciting speech of the investor and the head of the <a href="http://uangel.com.ua/">Ukrainian Business Angels Network</a> , Natalia Berezovska, who shared secrets and personal advice for start-up entrepreneurs and told how to attract investors to a young startup. <br><br>  With some lag from the planned schedule, after a short coffee break, it was finally time for the teams to start a ‚Äúfight‚Äù.  The allotted time was sorely missed.  Despite the words of Natalia: - ‚ÄúEven from the first seconds you can determine whether the startup will be successful,‚Äù the teams tried to tell as much about the project as possible.  It was necessary to squeeze strongly and to present their startups to the jury and investors as concisely as possible, and also to answer shorter questions immediately after the performance.  And here I want to advise others to prepare in advance and take with them presentation booklets so that they can be distributed to anyone in addition to the presentation. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/6e9/182/2c7/6e91822c76c9455fb0c2b6aacb4a6713.png"><br><br>  Our OR manager, Vasiliy Ziktor, began his presentation immediately after an incredibly exciting, and at the same time quite cheerful, out-of-competition speech by entrepreneur Mr. Mark Turella about how important it is to be able to follow the example of other successful businesses by promoting your own.  Three minutes of Vasina's speech flew like an instant and now questions and recommendations from an experienced jury began to fall.  He distinguished himself as the best among the other speakers in English, and <a href="http://2polyglot.com/%3Futm_source%3D2polyglot%26utm_medium%3DPR%26utm_campaign%3D2">2Polyglot</a> , as a result, was highly appreciated by the representatives of the commission, for which he was awarded the title of the best startup in the framework of Showcase. <br><br>  Our team has another experience of participation in the startup competition, and we are always ready to share it.  Another opportunity to make a statement is used, the skill of speeches is honed.  After each such event, you affirm in the understanding that participation and performance in them is never superfluous. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/292486/">https://habr.com/ru/post/292486/</a></p>
