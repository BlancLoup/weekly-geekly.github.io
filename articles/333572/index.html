They become a kind of public space, where guests come for new impressions.  If you know how to use technology to make a visit to a shopping center more interesting, more comfortable and more useful for consumers - welcome to our MEGA Accelerator 2. With your ideas, with us - support, buns, unique expertise and a prize of 2 million rubles. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/91b/f0b/bae/91bf0bbaee704d21954f66767ac34d05.jpg"><br><br>  For details, welcome under cat. <br><a name="habracut"></a>

      Once, shopping centers worked precisely for their intended purpose: people came there to see and, if desired, purchase various goods.  Shopping centers did not provide places for recreation, a variety of inexpensive cafes, and even more so children's centers and other entertainment.  In the post-Soviet space, such a model justified itself with a vengeance - large malls, where you could see in all its glory in beautiful windows, including expensive branded items, enjoyed respect and popularity.  We became pioneers in the creation of shopping centers, where you could not only buy the necessary things, but also have a delicious lunch, visit the children's area or go to the movies. <br><br>  We see how the needs and expectations of our guests change, and with our development strategy we respond to these changes.  Today, visitors come to MEGA to have an interesting weekend, celebrate holidays or relax with friends, for example, on a rainy summer day.  An extensive area of ‚Äã‚Äãcafes and restaurants, a fitness center, children's cities of professions, a zoo are just a small part of what, besides shops, awaits visitors to mega-malls.  Shopping centers regularly host contests, festivals and other entertainment events.  In addition, we try to keep up with progress and actively introduce digital in our shopping centers.  Already in MEGAH you can ask for the necessary information to touch boards and maps, order a taxi through an interactive kiosk, pick up an order from an online store through the PickUp-terminal, recharge your phone in a special lock-protected cell, accumulate points and get privileges in a mobile application. <br><br>  All this is just the beginning.  Today we are aware of the importance of a multi-channel approach in communicating with the customer, so many of our ideas and projects are related to the development and implementation of existing tools for improving customer experience.  We want to make MEGU even more convenient and more attractive for visitors: it is important for us that our guests should be interested in spending time here, coming all day with family and friends.  We need fresh interesting and creative ideas - and we are ready to help the young and bold in every possible way in the implementation of their projects. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/73d/172/8a5/73d1728a555d456d94811e947c4c152e.png"><br><br><h2>  Who we are and why we need you </h2><br>  In 2017, IKEA Centers Russia, with the support of GVA, one of the leaders in the field of entrepreneurship development, launches the <a href="http://mega-accelerator.ru/">second MEGA Accelerator</a> to find innovative technologies and solutions that will present new experience and impressions to visitors of MEGA shopping centers. <br><br>  MEGA Accelerator is 12 weeks of intensive work on the project, together with leading expert practitioners in the field of retail at the creative co-working platform PO‚ÇÇRT. <br><br>  Each selected team will receive 350 thousand rubles for the launch of a pilot project in Accelerator, the opportunity to talk with 65+ leading international retail experts and a real chance for a contract with IKEA Centers Russia. <br><br>  Bonus for the winner - 2 million rubles. <br><br>  What else, besides a cash prize and a great expertise, can we give: <br><br>  <b>Access to potential customers and investors.</b>  Accelerator will gather under its "roof" a large number of people, one way or another connected with this sphere.  And even if you do not become a winner, perhaps you will meet with someone who is interested in your project. <br><br>  <b>Accelerated approbation of the idea / prototype.</b>  With us you will be able to assess the viability of the project on the target group itself, and this will allow you to immediately isolate the strengths and weaknesses of the project and determine which way to develop further and how. <br><br>  <b>Understanding the problems and rethinking the business.</b>  Our meetings and trainings will allow us to take a different look at the project, understand its key problems and rethink some (if not all) aspects of this business. <br><br>  <b>Additional bonuses.</b>  Our experts have a large array of knowledge in this area, and during your participation in the accelerator you will acquire useful connections, learn to understand retail from the inside and, if necessary, be able to pump English. <br><br><h2>  Who we need </h2><br>  We accept technology projects in three directions: MEGA - meeting space, MEGA - interaction with visitors and MEGA - automated back office.  Below - more about each of them. <br><br>  <b>MEGA - meeting space</b> <br>  Our task is to attract visitors who will invite their acquaintances and friends to meet, take a walk or relax in the shopping center.  It is important that the objects themselves become better and adapt to the needs of visitors. <br>  The following solutions may be suitable for the implementation of the plan: <br><br><ul><li>  Services to improve the atmosphere in shopping centers (for example: virtual and augmented reality points, innovative modular furniture, robots, interactive exhibits, event places, technologies for creating sound, tactile sensations, new lighting, etc.) <br></li><li>  Automation of booking places in restaurants, services in stores and other services in MEGA <br></li><li>  Platforms for joint development of new projects, services and services (including crowdsourcing) <br></li><li>  Platform for collecting ideas and feedback from visitors and tenants <br></li></ul><br><br>  <b>MEGA interaction with visitors</b> <br>  A shopping center is a source of a huge array of various information: crowds of visitors with their gadgets, different routes <b>,</b> interests and preferences form big data - and they need to be skillfully used.  If you have ideas for analytics or data collection, for studying and optimizing the processes of interaction with visitors, then MEGA Accelerator is an ideal platform for testing them.  Here are some directions that may come up: <br><br><ul><li>  Solutions for collecting, analyzing and visualizing feedback and information from visitors <br></li><li>  Automate communication with visitors (chat bots, smart helpers, etc.) <br></li><li>  Personalization of products, services and interaction with visitors (quick personalized offers to the client) <br></li><li>  Simplify / improve the process of purchasing goods and services <br></li><li>  Crowdsourcing search platform services for visitors and stores in MEGA <br></li><li>  Educational services or companies (including for teenagers) <br></li><li>  Solutions for creating new impressions and inspiration of visitors (unusual wow-services, gamification, VR | AR) <br></li></ul><br><br>  <b>MEGA automated back office</b> <br>  Automation has penetrated into all areas of business - it speeds up routine processes, allows you to optimize work, train staff and increase productivity.  We really need complex and single solutions in order for the back office to work like a clock.  For example: <br><br><ul><li>  Tools for business planning, goal setting, KPI, performance assessment, etc. <br></li><li>  Tools for fast processing of electronic documents <br></li><li>  Online education solutions and tools for employees (in the form of games or simulators) <br></li><li>  Motivational tools to improve the quality of employees <br></li><li>  Internal uniform loyalty programs for employees of shops, offices, subcontractors <br></li><li>  Solutions for managing and exchanging information between departments <br></li></ul><br><br>  Attention!  The application must be submitted before July 27, 2017.  Details, as well as the path of the participant can be found on our <a href="http://mega-accelerator.ru/">website MEGA Accelerator.</a>  If you are ready for explosive growth, feel free to state your project.  And for inspiration come to our shopping centers. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/333572/">https://habr.com/ru/post/333572/</a></p>
