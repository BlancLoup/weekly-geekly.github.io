The <a href="http://crazyhamster.livejournal.com/166155.html">last</a> time the article was with a light "strawberry" taste, for which she received a wonderful set of curses on the newspaper's website.  True, about the same was positive feedback.  So the question torments me: ‚ÄúIs there sex on Mars?  That is, in our country. ‚Äù  I searched at home - I definitely do not.  So do not blame me for licentiousness and vulgarity, I am worse than you hypocrite. <br><br>  In my childhood I did not have a Lego designer.  I think most readers have newspapers too.  We had such huge plastic constructors that we used to carry to school and build all sorts of abstract designs from them.  But as time passed, the bourgeois commanded the minds of modern children, and modern children in hysterics require moms and dads to buy them a Danish designer.  But adults do not give up and quietly from children also play Lego.  Of course, <a href="http://zuzyaa.livejournal.com/23742.html">in an adult</a> .  I warn you in advance: by reference - calls for drug addiction and alcoholism.

      But this blog, I think, will appeal to programmers.  And it does not matter in what language you are programming, everyone will find something useful.  I haven‚Äôt found it because it‚Äôs not a programmer and I don‚Äôt like this blog at all, because I don‚Äôt understand anything about it.  Ok, enough to intrigue you.  The <a href="http://gotchas.info/">gotchas.info</a> blog <a href="http://gotchas.info/">contains</a> various source code (nothing, what am I in Spanish?), As stated in the description: "For your visual and intellectual pleasure."  Sorts for php, oracle, C ++ and other languages ‚Äã‚Äãhave already been published. <br><br>  The newspaper publishes chess puzzles, and I love chess.  At the unforgettable forum of the one and only ‚ÄúKV‚Äù someone casually mentioned that Anatoly Karpov was not a real champion.  If he is not real, how could he beat Victor Korchnoi?  Or Korchnoi fake chess player?  I propose to read the opinion of Anglofil <a href="http://valchess.livejournal.com/61422.html">about Viktor Lvovich Korchnoi</a> and his book.  Perhaps you will look at chess differently.  On my own, I would also recommend Kasparov's book Unlimited Duel. <br><br>  Listen, really, despite all my efforts, you still do not know what a ‚Äúblog‚Äù is and why is it needed?  Ah-ah-ah, you can say life goes by you.  After all, blogs have long been successfully used to promote their own business.  Although some irresponsible comrades continue to argue that blogs are entertainment for concerned graphomans.  Maybe you will convince the opposite of <a href="http://consillieri.com/blogger/post_1138233221.html">this article</a> . <br><br>  Continuing the topic of inadequate reaction to blogs, I bring to your attention the article " <a href="http://crash-zone.net/2006/02/03/pro-blogging-i-reakciju-na-onoe">About blogging and the reaction to it</a> ."  Yes, there are such people on the planet who are annoyed by blogs and everything connected with them, and they periodically ‚Äúopen their eyes‚Äù to what is happening to everyone who happens to be near.  Be sure to read this note, perhaps many of the critical comments you will disappear by themselves. <br><br>  The shooter in his Lab fervently tells about his <a href="http://razuma.net.ru/2006/02/07/poliklinicheskie-pohozhdenija">adventures in the clinic</a> .  I also can't get to the urologist for the second week (hello, hypocrisy!), Because when I go to the clinic after work, the tickets for the doctor have a strange peculiarity.  So I go all sick and dangerous to society. <br><br>  Kolesnik in his blog publishes a large <a href="http://kolesnik.ru/2006/interview-questions">collection of questions</a> that your employer can ask you when applying for a job.  Come across quite funny, and sometimes frankly incomprehensible.  For example: ‚ÄúHow many coins do you need to put one on top of another in order to reach the moon?‚Äù What do you think is being checked by such a question? <br><br>  The blog looks at the word " <a href="http://otebe.com/moe/266">Wait</a> " from all sides.  Not even the word itself, but our expectations with you, when we want something badly.  We are waiting for the kettle to boil, waiting for the trolley bus at the bus stop, and if it is bigger, then another salary or the World Cup.  And, in fact, the wait is very nice. <br><br>  Feminine opinion on blogs is a rare thing, because it is more valuable.  Anelka expresses her opinion on the question ‚Äú <a href="http://pixeblog.com/pixel/185">What is important in a woman?</a> ‚Äù It always amazed me that women and men evaluate themselves and the opposite sex completely differently.  I still tend to think that we are from different planets.  I have no other explanation for this divergence of views. <br><br>  Exler attended to the problem of <a href="http://exler.ru/reviews/25-01-06.htm">noise reduction</a> .  Too coolers are noisy, although they cool the system blog regularly.  It turns out (I did not know about such devices), there are special controls for the rotation of the fans, which are mounted in the five-inch slot of the case, and the coolers are included directly in this device.  How to manage to keep track of all the technical innovations? <br><br>  Internet business today publishes <a href="http://interbiz.ru/2006/02/03/60">interesting statistics</a> that 89% of Internet users share materials sites by e-mail.  This statistics is interesting, first of all, to those who write and distribute various computer viruses.  So, dear Internet users, change your strategy. <br><br>  Manic weblog shares with us some of their <a href="http://softwaremaniacs.org/blog/2006/02/07/gnome-little-niceties">favorite programs</a> .  I draw attention to this note, because these programs work under Ubuntu (one of the Linux distributions) and may be of interest to all fans of this alternative Windows system. <br><br>  The Linux theme continues in MadDog's Blog.  Linux users, in principle, are deprived of entertainment, games are created, first of all, under the Windows platform, but the author of this blog took care of the users of the penguin OS and <a href="http://blogs.sitengine.ru/archives/310.html">talks about games</a> that can be safely installed on the Linux system. <br><br>  Finding usability really finds convenient solutions for us.  This time the blog advises us " <a href="http://usabilist.de/seeking/ru/how-to-get-maximum-from-ms-outlook">How to squeeze the most out of MS Outlook</a> ."  Many snort: "And what's stopping you just go to The Bat!  or any other email client? ‚ÄùThe fact is that MS Outlook is a standard in many companies and will not be allowed to be replaced with a more convenient mailer. <br><br>  A fun problem is raised on the intruder's register blog.  As funny as insoluble: <a href="http://register.intruder.ru/2006/02/06/elektronnaya-pochta-po-telefonu">how to dictate</a> your email address over the phone to be understood.  There are several solutions, but none of them is universal.  I join the author and ask the public to brainstorm about this. <br><br>  The Information Bureau informs us that, it turns out, <a href="http://makarenkov.org/%3Fp%3D16">there are online critics</a> (hello to all Habr commentators!).  Not only do they exist, they also know better than the author himself how he should write and what he should write.  And in the same blog, as a counterweight, the article " <a href="http://makarenkov.org/%3Fp%3D17">Dear" writers "!</a> ".  Now goes to the nuts to all graphomania and novice journalists.  The main idea - learn.  But do not engage in self-education, pay money for seminars, master classes and other similar courses.  I highly recommend everyone to read. <br><br>  On the eve of the upcoming male / female national holidays, Stranger than Fiction blog <a href="http://shevtsov.fanstvo.com/2006/02/07/v-predverii-prazdnikov">reflects on possible gifts</a> .  How many times have I read these tips, but have not learned to choose gifts.  Yes, I am not the most romantic boyfriend, I don‚Äôt like to give flowers at all.  But, I hope, this note will help someone to please their loved one. <br><br>  On Froloff.net, two of the most successful Internet portals, Google and Yahoo, are set off.  Well, okay, do not bleed, and compared.  In addition, MSN is gaining momentum and may soon become the third opponent in this fun game. <br><br>  And on LiveMarketing.ru the author tells <a href="http://livemarketing.ru/2006/02/04/196">about the personal rating of paper magazines</a> .  You may also be interested in some of the listed media.  The theme, of course, corresponds to the blog - marketing. <br><br>  It should also be noted that the bloggers were marked by the same chorus with the same notes about the release of the new version of the Firefox browser, the appearance of the chat on Google and the closing of the popular blog of our compatriot <a href="http://inforedesign.com/">Denis Perehrest</a> .  Probably, the end of the world will write less. <br><br>  <b>Your personal aggregator Alexey Kaletsky</b> <br><br>  <a href="http://kv.by/index2006070604.htm">Published in "Computer News" (# 7, 2006)</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/288038/">https://habr.com/ru/post/288038/</a></p>
