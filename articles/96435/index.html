      With the results of this survey, I would like to introduce you to this topic.  Below will be told about who they are - users and readers of Habrakhabr, what they do, what they like, what they think about, and three practical advice will be given, plus a bonus! <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  We can do without boring, in many respects obvious statistics such as gender, age, education, marital status, etc., I would only note that among the visitors of Habr only 11.4% belong to aliens (and many expected that they would be under 90%).  It is better to move on to more interesting topics, for example, the professional activity of Habravchan. <br><br>  Information on what Habr's readers and users are doing can be gathered from two sources: the questionnaire and the Thematic Media media kit.  In the questionnaire it was possible to choose only one option, that is, the main type of activity, the guys from TM provided an opportunity for multi-selection. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/bd4/07e/a69/bd407ea6977bb0df5ed1885986eb26bf.png" alt="profession habravchan"><br><br>  The result tells us that a typical developer in the former USSR combines programming with many other tasks: from traditional system administration and layout to exotic ones like merchant fleet management or furniture production.  In addition to the professions indicated in the questionnaire, salesmen, bureaucrats, scholars and even artists of the orchestra and herdsmen-herdsmen are among us. <br><br>  Nearly two thirds of habravchan work "on uncle."  More than a third (36.6%) of users combine different types of activity, for example, work and study or work and freelancing. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/4f3/7bc/c7d/4f37bcc7d170ed72c42baf4a67debd11.png" alt="place of work habrovchan"><br><br>  A third of users consider themselves to be experienced professionals.  Slightly more than 14% indicated that they are engaged in managerial functions.  This indicates a high professional and expert community level.  (Want to argue? I ask in the comments.) <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/52f/9b3/b10/52f9b3b10824dcbf3f3fe9403d4ec0db.png" alt="image"><br><br>  But why do these people visit Habrahabr, and sometimes they also write topics? <br><br>  The study showed that Habr is considered primarily an educational news resource.  Entertainment materials are less interesting. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/73c/67a/7a5/73c67a7a5fef4f73fe3a24b9a57dfc73.png" alt="image"><br>  <b>From here the first practical advice:</b> Want to write a popular post on Habr√©?  Write something developing or relevant news, preferably with analytics, and not humor or offtopic. <br><br>  Most of all people like it when they share their experience with them. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/69a/163/f63/69a163f63465a7ea5930a97800fc5bc7.png" alt="image"><br>  <b>From here comes the second tip:</b> If you want to create a training topic like ‚ÄúHow to hammer a nail,‚Äù write about how you did it: what hammer was used, how was the finger beaten off, etc., and not just a step-by-step instruction. <br><br>  Most of Habr's users approach consumer information, that is, they only read.  However, 31.2% of users who have an account are also ready to create it, write their articles and topics.  But what pushes them to publish? <br><br>  As it turned out, in the overwhelming majority of cases, this is a simple desire to share knowledge, to communicate.  Not many people want to become known or increase the level of karma, a little more than a quarter of those surveyed.  Often, among the incentives for creating topics, people distinguish invites. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/f0a/aa0/b47/f0aaa0b47abb07b5933669bbd8922b89.png" alt="image"><br><br>  What about karma?  It would seem that this axis around which all Habr turns.  However, research shows that people treat her calmly.  Only a third of users who have an account, experiencing because of its level.  It's funny that the attitude towards her karma does not change depending on her level, that is, the one who has karma, for example, is more than 100, is also very frustrated because of her fall, as well as the one who has, say, 10. <br><br>  In general, for more than 70% of Habr's visitors, the level of karma does not mean anything special, only 14.3% consider it an indicator of user competence. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/562/f77/8d1/562f778d1b38374579c6ff8949fec9c8.png" alt="image"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/e6d/fe7/b2a/e6dfe7b2a7d4551641325bec48fcbaea.png" alt="image"><br><br>  <b>Third practical advice: It is</b> pointless to worry about karma.  Although for convenience it is worth keeping it above 5. <br><br>  I note that I was unable to detect any degree of relationship between karma and other indicators: age, position at work, time spent on Habr√©, blogging passion.  Is that only with activity - the higher the karma, the more activity on Habr√©, read it is necessary to write topics, if you want to increase it.  For this conclusion, you can thank the captain Obvious. <br><br>  But besides work and reading Habr, people usually still have a rest.  Hobby inhabitants turned out to be less interesting than I expected. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/4cc/66c/eea/4cc66ceeaa55aab12be1fea9dd7bf7a0.png" alt="image"><br>  It's funny that so many people are fond of TV shows.  Did the new season of <a href="http://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%25A0%25D0%25B0%25D0%25B1%25D1%258B%25D0%25BD%25D1%258F_%25D0%2598%25D0%25B7%25D0%25B0%25D1%2583%25D1%2580%25D0%25B0" title="Slaves Isaurs">Slave Izaura</a> come out?  Among the original hobbies can be identified historical reconstruction, rc models, collecting photos swingers, embroidery, kitesurfing. <br><br>  What can be said in the end?  I think we can summarize the study as follows: <br><br>  <i>Habrahabr is visited, read and written, young IT specialists with a high educational and professional level, focused on its further improvement (while reading this phrase from boredom died - author's comment).</i>  <i>As a result, from such a company you can gain mostly good.</i> <br><br>  Finally, one more thing.  Do users of Habr consider an interesting resource or read it out of habit, in other words, Habr is a cake?  Affirmatively, 57% of respondents answer this question, another 21% are simply not in the topic. <br><br>  <b>And, as I wrote at the beginning, a bonus!</b>  Bonus is the best answers of those whose forms I found inadequate, a kind of leper colony of this study.  It can be read <a href="http://spreadsheets.google.com/pub%3Fkey%3D0ArDQXTOeK8FtdEZSWC1UbmtPYUdRZ1pvS216UThiV0E%26amp%3Bhl%3Dru%26amp%3Boutput%3Dhtml" title="here on google docks">here on Google Docks</a> . <br><br>  More complete research results, as well as a description of its methodology, can be found by downloading the report: <a href="http://narod.ru/disk/21865519000/%25D0%2598%25D1%2581%25D1%2581%25D0%25BB%25D0%25B5%25D0%25B4%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B2%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B5%2520%25D1%2581%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B1%25D1%2589%25D0%25B5%25D1%2581%25D1%2582%25D0%25B2%25D0%25B0%2520%25D0%25A5%25D0%25B0%25D0%25B1%25D1%2580%25D0%25B0%25D1%2585%25D0%25B0%25D0%25B1%25D1%2580%25D0%25B0.pdf.html">Habrahabr community: composition, values, and psychological attitudes</a> . <br><br>  I note that I consider it wrong to publish the answers to the questionnaire in the public domain.  The survey was anonymous, but if desired, by the level of karma, you can identify some respondents.  Thus, the reliability of the conclusions made and the results as a whole remain entirely on my conscience, and it will not be possible to verify them. <br><br>  If you have questions, ask in the comments. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/96435/">https://habr.com/ru/post/96435/</a></p>
