Not just not popular, but VERY not popular. <br><br>  The guilty exhibition put: <br><ul><li>  They are not relevant in the Internet era - in order to familiarize yourself with the product and even talk with the team you do not need to go somewhere, just open the browser. </li><li>  They do not pay off - the prices have remained since the "fat" times, and the wallets of the clients have since become very emaciated. </li><li>  Wrong visitors come to them - the stands seem to be very specialized exhibitions that are mostly attended by schoolchildren, students, housewives, retired people and fans of free souvenirs.  And also lower-level managers and technical specialists who are interested in seeing, but people above (who influence on this process) are engaged in purchases in companies who have no time to go to exhibitions. </li></ul><br>  It's like that.  I can agree with everything and subscribe to each item. <br><blockquote>  But the problem is not in exhibitions at all.  It is important to choose the right ones. </blockquote>  <b>Let's understand</b> <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Why do people go to exhibitions? <br><ul><li>  <b>To talk</b>  A person wants to chat with a live developer, ask him when the latest version comes out, why there was an error when installing the product.  This is a valuable visitor.  But, unfortunately, such people usually go to talk with the developers of a <b>particular</b> product, so that competitors are unlikely to succeed in capturing its attention. </li><li>  <b>See a cut of the market</b> .  These are the most interesting visitors for us.  They want to understand in an hour what is happening in the market. Go through the stands, listen to all the products, ask questions - and make a first opinion for yourself.  Then in the search engine and the browser, they will get more and deeper information, but they will get the first impression here and now.  <i>Unfortunately for us, these people are mainly from the lower link, not involved in the procurement.</i> </li><li>  <b>Out of habit</b> .  Previously, it was interesting, suddenly, and now something sort of show.  Such stumble on identical stands, get bored, get tired quickly and go home. </li><li>  <b>By necessity</b> .  From work they sent, they say, find out what is new.  That is, too, out of habit, but the habit is not with the visitor, but with his superiors.  This is likely to quickly run home, and at work will tell you that he was reeling between the stands all day. </li></ul><br>  And where are those for whom we are trying so hard?  Where are the decision makers or even their deputies and assistants? <br>  They are not.  Why?

      Well, remember your feelings after a day of standing on the stand.  Noise, din, cry, op;  here students are collecting pens, and even speaking impartially towards manufacturers of products;  there the ‚Äúexperts‚Äù find out which function in the product is more important.  Gypsy camp, in general. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/8b6/640/eb1/8b6640eb1d914f28a2a8413f83804d47.jpg"><br>  <i>Seem to be?</i> <br><br>  And you want the director of the company (even a small one) or his deputy to voluntarily go to this bedlam?  No, they will send an engineer there, and then they will ask, ‚Äúso how?‚Äù But will they listen to engineering opinion?  This is a big question ... <br><br>  <b>So what should you do?</b> <br><br>  And here I will reveal to you a GREAT SECRET ... An open ... <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/53a/561/36f/53a56136fb4544afa2720f0b48ca1f4f.jpg"><br>  <i>Just do not tell anyone!</i> <br><br>  <i><b>Do not participate in exhibitions dedicated to your business.</b></i>  <i><b>Participate in trade fairs dedicated to your client's business.</b></i> <br><br>  How to understand this?  I will explain with an example.  We are engaged in monitoring the activities of employees on the PC. <br><blockquote>  At first glance, it seems that you need to participate in exhibitions dedicated to <i>security</i> (promoting our technology there - an alternative to DLP) and Human Resources (there you need to talk about working time accounting). </blockquote>  The look is wrong. <br><br>  Even if a decision-maker enters these exhibitions, this person: <br><ul><li>  will already know what it wants from DLP, personnel monitoring system or time tracking and will compare the functionality; </li><li>  will be attacked by your competitors. </li></ul><br>  You will spend a lot of effort explaining to a potential client that the functionality that he considers important is not needed at all.  But this opportunity, which only you have implemented - it just really helps! <br>  But, alas, the person has already come to the exhibition with a certain understanding of the ideal product for himself (which, we note, someone formed for him) and with this understanding, most likely he will leave. <br><br>  Now imagine an exhibition (and much, much, much better conference!), Which is <i>arranged by the</i> bankers <i>themselves</i> , beekeepers, small business owners, owners of the trucking companies ... <br>  There will come no longer ordinary employees, and high-level managers.  And it is there that you do not just present your product, <i>you will form an opinion about your product in the minds of potential customers, as the most suitable for solving actual problems</i> . <br>  When we talk about our product, we often hear - ‚Äúwe didn‚Äôt know what happened!‚Äù <br><br>  At such exhibitions, most likely there will be not only competitors, but also people who have heard about them.  And only from you financial "exhaust" will depend on participation in this exhibition. <br>  Will he be good.  Or great.  But there is no other way;) <br><br>  Good luck in business! </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/299452/">https://habr.com/ru/post/299452/</a></p>
