  <section class="page js-page"><h1>IP phones Akuvox. Review premium models</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  In the <a href="https://geektimes.ru/company/arttel/blog/282206/">previous article,</a> we met a new brand on the Russian IP telephony market - by Akuvox.  We started our acquaintance with an overview of low-end IP phones from the SP-R5X line.  Today we will consider more expensive and advanced phones that are designed for managers at various levels and ordinary employees of the company who actively use the telephone in their work.  Our today's heroes: the older model from the fiftieth line of Akuvox phones - SP-R59P / G, and also two phones of the sixtieth series - SP-R63G and SP-R67G. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/836/d52/30e/836d5230e7f54521a99dac59865d8638.jpg"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br><h3>  Akuvox SP-R59P / G </h3><br>  For those who have not read the previous article, I‚Äôll note that we tried to find analogs in the model range of Yealink for all the Akuvox IP phones reviewed.  We did this not on our own whim, but because the devices of these two manufacturers really have a lot in common - starting with the appearance and ending with the menu structure.  And if to be completely accurate in the formulations, then it is Akuvox phones that try to be similar to Yealink phones, in principle, in principle there is no crime.

     <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/a76/dae/2e3/a76dae2e344f4cc28c2dd82c141bb30e.jpg"></a> <br><br>  If you continue the tradition, then the closest analogue of the Akuvox SP-R59P / G in the Yealink model range is the discontinued SIP-T28P device.  Their common features are a large monochrome display, support for 6 SIP lines, ten programmable LED keys on the right side of the phone, as well as the ability to connect additional extension keypads. <br><br>  As for the differences, the first thing that catches the eye is the organization of the desktop on the phone screen.  It is actually made somewhat unusual, perhaps not perfect in terms of appearance, but very functional.  Large fonts and icons in combination with a huge display with a diagonal of 4.3 inches make it easy to read all the information from the screen, even from a great distance.  The only drawback is that the number for the incoming call can not be seen as well as the outgoing one.  The menu structure of Akuvox SP-R59P / G has not undergone any changes compared to the younger models. <br><br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/2f2/2e7/78a/2f22e778a51a40cd89d679f0c4aadb5e.jpg"></a> <br><br>  Another difference from Yealink SIP-T28P is that Akuvox has a modification with two gigabit network ports.  The model <a href="https://arttel.ru/shop/ip-telefony/akuvox-sp-r59g">SP-R59G retails</a> 136 US dollars, the model with two hundred-megabit ports <a href="https://arttel.ru/shop/ip-telefony/akuvox-sp-r59p">SP-R59P</a> is 10 dollars cheaper.  Both versions support PoE power. <br><br>  The second "chip" Akuvox SP-R59P / G in addition to the huge display is the presence of ten programmable keys with built-in two-color LED each.  The main purpose of these keys is to indicate the status of the lines of other subscribers (green - free, red - busy, red flashing - a call comes in) with the possibility of quickly calling them by pressing.  However, in addition to the BLF function, you can assign any other of 30 different types of actions to each such key (for example, call transfer, parking, menu entry, phonebook, do not disturb mode, redial, and others).  To sign the actions assigned to the key, good old cardboard inserts are provided - one is already installed on the phone, two spare ones are included. <br><br>  For those who are ten programmable keys will be small - Akuvox SP-R59P / G has a special port for connecting additional keypads.  According to the documentation, Akuvox EM53 (retail price - $ 97) can act as such panels.  This model is equipped with a monochrome display with a diagonal of 4.3 inches and a resolution of 272x480, which is designed to sign the actions assigned to the keys.  This is not only more convenient than using cardboard inserts, but also allows you to triple the number of actions performed by one panel of actions.  It works as follows: in addition to the twenty main LED keys, the panel has two keys below the screen for scrolling between three virtual pages.  Thus, each key can perform up to three actions, and the entire panel up to sixty.  Of course, using the actions on the second and third pages is not as convenient as on the first.  But, first, the scrolling functionality can be disabled in the settings, and, secondly, instead of or together using several pages, you can connect several Akuvox EM53 modules to the phone in a chain.  Up to three modules are supported, all modules are powered directly from the phone, the panels and their keys are also configured via the phone's web interface. <br><br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/f09/b90/c85/f09b90c8557f4a6fa679eb5c499716d2.jpg"></a> <br><br>  Akuvox SP-R59P / G is made in the same package as the younger models.  Naturally, it has a slightly larger size, and because of the massive frame around the display and the lack of rounding on the sides of the case, the phone looks more visually than it actually is.  However, in this case, it does not cause any rejection - the phone looks solid and solid, and the person talking on it makes an important impression :) The number and location of the function keys also did not change compared to the younger models.  But the handset has slightly changed its shape - it has grown a couple of centimeters in length, thanks to which it has become a bit more convenient to take it off the phone. <br><br><h3>  Akuvox SP-R63G </h3><br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/b39/c96/f72/b39c96f72e5944eba01f2e1163ec3e4d.jpg"></a> <br><br>  Model <a href="https://arttel.ru/shop/ip-telefony/akuvox-sp-r63g">SP-R63G</a> opens the sixtieth line of IP phones Akuvox, which so far, however, consists of only two models.  The main difference between the sixtieth series phones from the fiftieth is the color display.  In the case of the SP-R63G, it is relatively small - 2.8 inches with a resolution of 320x240 pixels, but it is quite enough to display all the necessary information.  The interface is drawn qualitatively, the fonts are nice, the icons and icons used are pretty nice.  True, all this applies only to the main screen - the menu is a bit worse, primarily because of the background image and the chosen color scheme.  If you close your eyes to the menu, then we can state that the interface SP-R63G is one of the most pleasant among the phones with small color displays. <br><br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/c18/fe8/f8d/c18fe8f8d9294cdcb4ce1a596d40bd2e.jpg"></a> <br><br>  If we go back to comparison with Yealink phones, then there are no direct analogues either in the SP-R63G or in the older model SP-R67G in the model range of Yealink.  It is clear that these devices are closest to the fortieth Yealink series, but only if they are close.  Most likely, this happened due to the fact that in Yealink they created the SIP-T4 series in terms of design from scratch, and in Akuvox - based on the phones of the younger series.  Actually, the same cases are used, only from black plastic and with black glossy edging around the display.  Such a simple step, by the way, refreshed the look of the phones and the same Akuvox SP-R63G looks very modern. <br><br>  Model SP-R63G, which is sold on the Russian market for $ 108 at retail, has three independent SIP accounts, two gigabit network ports and can be powered using PoE technology.  Also, the phone has 8 LED programmable keys.  They are located not as in the previous model SP-R59P / G, but on the sides of the display.  Some of them (at least two) should be left to select the line - it is much more convenient to switch between calls and transfer calls - the rest can be used at your own discretion, including for the BLF function. <br><br>  As for the support of additional panels - the situation with them is a bit strange.  In the documentation, such support is stated, the port for connection is present and works properly, but there are no holes for rigid mounting of the panel to the phone.  In this embodiment, the use of the panel is sometimes not very convenient, and this is a serious miscalculation by the manufacturer.  Therefore, it is more correct, perhaps, to assume that Akuvox SP-R63G does not have support for additional panels. <br><br><h3>  Akuvox SP-R67G </h3><br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/572/7d0/229/5727d0229c664dedaec73757aa120de4.jpg"></a> <br><br>  Go to the top model of Akuvox IP phones - <a href="https://arttel.ru/shop/ip-telefony/akuvox-sp-r67g">SP-R67G</a> .  This is a six-lined Gigabit IP phone worth 154 US dollars with a large color display and PoE support.  The display has a diagonal of 4.3 inches with a resolution of 480x272 pixels, but the interface on it does not look as cool as the model SP-R63G.  The main reason for this is the default acid background image, which in theory can be changed if you guess the correct image file format.  Also, minor drawbacks of graphics that were invisible on the small screen of the SP-R63G are now striking on the large display of the SP-R67G.  But there is a big screen and its undoubted advantages - the information is displayed on it bright and large, which is likely to appeal to many users, especially in age. <br><br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/156/f74/948/156f74948cf145dfac3a8f2441b052d7.jpg"></a> <br><br>  In general, the SP-R67G is an almost complete analog of the SP-R59P / G, only in a black case and with a color display.  He also has 10 programmable keys on the starboard and another ten on the left and right of the display.  There is support for additional expansion panels, but another model is Akuvox EM63.  Its main difference from the EM53 is a black case with a glossy frame (to be in the same style as the phone), as well as a color display instead of a monochrome one.  The rest - the same 20 keys, three virtual pages, the ability to connect up to three panels in a chain, powered directly from the phone.  The price of the EM63 panel is 115 dollars. <br><br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/302/663/ae9/302663ae932a4dbf803c4e98dc0b0723.jpg"></a> <br><br>  The SP-R67G looks great.  Still, black plastic almost always makes a more solid impression than gray.  The glossy frame around the display is well combined with the body, though before the first use - it is almost instantly covered with fingerprints.  It is necessary to wipe this frame gently - preferably with a soft cloth, otherwise there is a risk of scratches.  As for the SP-R67G, the phone inherited from the SP-R59P / G model (that is, a little longer than the other devices), only the color changed, and the ‚ÄúHD‚Äù text on it was made in a more beautiful typeface. <br><br><h3>  Akuvox EM53 and EM63 Expansion Panels </h3><br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/5dc/0b9/425/5dc0b94258304b8aa2bdc5f38f9746d3.jpg"></a> <br>  <font color="99999"><i>On the left is the Akuvox EM53 panel, on the right is the Akuvox EM63 panel.</i></font> <br><br>  We already managed to discuss these panels when talking about phones.  We only note that, contrary to the recommendations of the manufacturer, these panels are (at least at the time of writing) interchangeable - that is, the <a href="https://arttel.ru/shop/aksessuary/akuvox-em63">EM63</a> panel can be used with the SP-R59P / G, and the <a href="https://arttel.ru/shop/aksessuary/akuvox-em53">EM53</a> with the SP-R67G.  Of course, stylistically it will look ridiculous, but it will work.  In addition, chains of different types can be assembled chains - they work great together. <br><br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/820/9b0/fda/8209b0fda20f453997aabd4226f5857c.jpg"></a> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/aea/e21/ef1/aeae21ef14bd4a9485f056435c70f402.jpg"></a> <br>  <font color="99999"><i>On the left is the Akuvox EM53 panel, on the right is the Akuvox EM63 panel.</i></font> <br><br>  In principle, all this is not surprising, considering that the panels are built on a completely identical element base, which is based on the Audiocodes AC495L chipset, which is already familiar to us from using Akuvox IP phones in budget models.  However, compatibility is a question not only of the hardware component, but also of the software, and, judging by the software version, it is different for the panels.  Therefore, in the future, such ‚Äúomnivorousness‚Äù is not guaranteed, and it is better to focus on the models recommended by the manufacturer. <br><br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/18f/51e/bd0/18f51ebd0f0d446db19e9a7c6049c36d.jpg"></a> <br>  <font color="99999"><i>On the left is the Akuvox EM53 panel, on the right is the Akuvox EM63 panel.</i></font> <br><br><h3>  Iron </h3><br>  If we are talking about the hardware component, you can see what is inside the phones themselves.  In the case of the Akuvox SP-R59P / G, this is still the same Audiocodes AC495L operating at a frequency of 87.5 MHz.  In the case of the SP-R63G and SP-R67G models, the main chip is closed by a radiator, therefore, it is only possible to speculate about it.  Definitely, this is also Audiocodes, possibly models AC494E / AC495E, supporting work with color displays. <br><br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/9be/44c/83f/9be44c83fc9942f28ffc56043539d594.jpg"></a> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/d2b/a90/377/d2ba90377ddc4d42b35cf48bb16512b3.jpg"></a> <br>  <font color="99999"><i>On the left - Akuvox SP-R59P / G phone, on the right - Akuvox SP-R67G</i></font> <br><br><h3>  Sound quality </h3><br>  That, on the contrary, is clearly seen when inspecting the interiors of the phones, as this is a huge reverberation speakerphone camera for the SP-R59P / G and SP-R67G models.  It greatly exceeds the size of similar cameras in budget Akuvox phones and models SP-R63G.  In addition, the engineers approached the matter responsibly and the junction of the reverberation chamber and the phone body were carefully laid with a rubber gasket.  As a result - great sound quality in hands-free mode.  In this regard, the benchmark for me was <a href="https://geektimes.ru/company/arttel/blog/278772/">ATCOM R1L</a> (like the entire ATCOM R line), so the SP-R59P / G and SP-R67G models came very close to this benchmark.  When using the G.722 wideband codec, the sound is very juicy and clear.  The only thing, at the maximum volume levels, is still a small background and rattling, but for a comfortable conversation a couple of meters from the phone, half the volume will be enough.  And to talk at large distances will not allow the first microphone. <br><br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/98c/397/ca3/98c397ca35cd44dbb85766c25c43fa1e.jpg"></a> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/2e2/954/c0a/2e2954c0a8774851a5f30be1e6f7883d.jpg"></a> <br>  <font color="99999"><i>On the left - Akuvox SP-R59P / G reverberation camera, on the right - Akuvox SP-R63G</i></font> <br><br>  As for the quality of the speakerphone on the model SP-R63G, then it is normal, like other budget phones Akuvox.  Neither rejection nor admiration it causes.  The same can be said about all three phones when talking on the handset - the quality is normal, it is not much different from any other modern IP-phones.  Still, the tube is a compact thing and there is much less space for creativity here. <br><br><h3>  Russification </h3><br>  In the last article I noted that so far not all Akuvox phones have received the Russian language and expressed the hope that this is only a matter of time.  It did not take long to wait - at least, we can already note positive developments in this direction.  First, all three models - the heroes of this article - have the support of the Russian language.  As for the panels, they don‚Äôt have their own interface, so it‚Äôs not entirely correct to talk about the presence or absence of Russification.  But I managed to notice that the signatures on the screen of the panels are currently displayed only in English, so there is still something to work on. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/db1/4ff/b25/db14ffb257e04f28b8d8c64ebe35912a.jpg"><br><br>  Secondly, both the phones and the panels were completed with quick start guides.  Moreover, this is not a small piece of paper, but a whole brochure of two dozen pages with a description of the order of connection, the implementation of basic actions and settings in the Web interface in Russian.  Thirdly, Russian-language information appeared on the phone packaging, while in the form of a sticker, in the future, the appearance of fully branded boxes is possible.  By the way, if you believe the information on this sticker, then the warranty period for Akuvox phones is 2 years.  As for the phone keyboards, there are Russian letters on all models of the fiftieth series, the SP-R63G and SP-R67G have no translation yet. <br><br><h3>  Network Protocols, Configuration </h3><br>  In terms of network protocol support, as well as configuration methods, Akuvox premium models are no different from budget ones.  Therefore, a short line - phones support VLAN, QoS, OpenVPN, SIP over TLS (SIPS), as well as SRTP voice traffic encryption.  The basic setting can be carried out through the phone menu (navigation through it is very convenient, thanks to the hardware keys ‚Äúback‚Äù and ‚Äúhome‚Äù), the full setting - using a rather convenient, thanks to the logical structure, Web-interface.  Autotune from FTP, TFTP, HTTP and HTTPS servers is available.  When enabled, the phone can receive its address by sending a SIP Multicast request, using various DHCP options, and also receive it manually from the administrator.  For ease of management and monitoring, support for TR-069 and SNMP is provided. <br><br><h3>  Conclusion </h3><br>  We will not summarize the conclusions, but rather give a brief assessment of each of the phones reviewed today.  So, the SP-R59P / G is a very interesting model, with a huge display on which all the information is perfectly readable.  Excellent, one of the best on the market, hands-free quality.  Ten programmable keys, the number of which can be increased to 70, by connecting additional expansion panels.  At the same time, the number of programmed actions can reach 190. Power is available via PoE and optional support for a gigabit network.  Definitely can be recommended to secretaries, who have to handle a large amount of incoming calls and managers, among whom there are many amateurs to talk using a speakerphone.  Ordinary employees who actively use the telephone in their work, Akuvox SP-R59P / G, too, should come to taste. <br><br>  Model SP-R63G - a little easier.  Small but very nice color display.  Smaller than the number of programmable keys for the SP-R59P / G, support for expansion panels seems to be as it is, but it is not implemented correctly.  The sound quality, both in normal mode and in speakerphone mode, is normal.  Akuvox SP-R63G can be advised to those who are looking for an inexpensive IP phone with the obligatory presence of a color display and support for Gigabit Ethernet. <br><br>  About the most expensive and advanced phone Akuvox SP-R67G, you can say the same thing as about the SP-R59P / G.  This is a great speakerphone, and the presence of programmable keys with the possibility of increasing their number, and support for PoE with Gigabit Ethernet.  The only important difference is the color display.  Thanks to a very reasonable price, Akuvox SP-R67G is one of the best options in the segment of phones designed for executives. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/399225/">https://habr.com/ru/post/399225/</a></p>
