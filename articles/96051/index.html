    <br><br><br><br>  A pager, cell phones, another device that I don‚Äôt even remember the name of (like a smartphone, just don‚Äôt call and often without the Internet ... HP let out a lot of them ... I don‚Äôt remember), a smartphone. <br><br>  I had all this (approximately in such a sequence). <br><br>  The functionality of the devices grew, but one parameter invariably deteriorated: the running time.  Up to the point that I no longer had time to get to work, as I had to charge the phone. <br><br>  Yes, I could go online through it, read mail and even manage SSH through servers.  I could write multi-page documents, watch tables ... <br><br>  But I <b>could not</b> be sure that when I just need to make a call or take a call, I <b>can</b> do it.  There are, of course, devices for autonomous charging, but it turns out that the device, the basic function of which is voice communication, forces me to carry with me a device that will support this very function for it. <br><br>  But a person gets used to everything.  I got used to two charges during the day, to a set of devices in the portfolio for recharging.  And so it would have continued, probably, until now, if the phone hadn‚Äôt gone to telephone heaven / hell for purely everyday reasons ( <i>don‚Äôt put the phone in your shirt pocket. Because you can lean over something with water and your phone will go deep immersion. Amen</i> .) <br><br>  Now go back a few weeks ago.  My colleague was looking for a second phone.  His acquaintance had been praising Philips for a long time - for the fact that he works without tackling much more than regular phones.  When I saw in the specifications the stated standby time of 50 days, I was surprised at the arrogance of the manufacturer.  5, 10, 15 could still be understood.  But 50 ... In general, when I asked about how many times my colleague had charged the phone after <b>2 months</b> , it turned out that in all that time he had to connect to the power supply only <b>once</b> .  With a few minutes a day. <br><br>  There was no sense in not believing, and so my other phone was a slightly different model (with two SIM cards) from Philips.  Here, of course, not 50 days, but now I remember about charging once every 10-15 days, with a decent amount of conversations almost every day. <br><br>  Somewhere on the forums about these phones they say: a battery that can call.  And indeed it is.  All that can eat up the charge, either removed or modified (for example, the logic of the display).  This principle, by the way, is supported in everything else.  For example, are you using phone contact groups?  I have not used in any of the 5 that I dealt with.  And there are no groups. <br><br>  Of course, there are downsides, and if this is interesting, I can tell you about them.  But the very fact that I am truly confident in such a survivability of the apparatus decides everything for me. <br><br>  UPD: The phone in question is the <a href="">Philips Xenium X710</a> . </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/96051/">https://habr.com/ru/post/96051/</a></p>
