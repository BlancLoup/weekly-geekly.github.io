  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Mail.ru: hidden opportunities</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  This post was created under the influence of the <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/206860/">question</a> that sounded in the previous topic: "And who remained on mail.ru something?".  In addition to this comment, there were many others: that it is embarrassing to be a mail.ru user, and even to use the site, it is undesirable to admit it.  As a joke, such comments may be good, but the idea itself: to evaluate users by the resource on which they are located does not seem rich and fruitful. <br><br>  Mail.ru has good computer communities.  In my opinion, the best of those that exist on social networks.  Not <a href="http://forum.oszone.net/">oszone</a> , of course, but it is difficult for novice users to find specialized computer resources and register there.  And the community - here they are, near.  And although the members of such communities are mostly not professionals, they provide effective assistance.  I once looked at the records of two computer communities to find out how true and effective the tips offered there are.  As it turned out, about 80% of the questions asked there, or 93-95%, in computer communities on mail.ru, if you do not take into account abandoned questions.  Such questions are a typical problem of computer communities, when having laid out the post the author no longer appears in his topic, or by answering a couple of comments and finding out that the developer doesn‚Äôt want the developer to do everything well, but he doesn‚Äôt want to understand himself or herself, forgetting to talk about the result. <br><br>  But, in fact, this article is not about computer communities mail.ru.  I remembered them only to explain: who I am, what I do on mail.ru and what is the reason for the interest in this site. <br>  The post itself is dedicated to the undocumented features of the site mail.ru.

      If you use mail.ru and My World social network, you may be interested to check how well you know this site and try to solve the tasks yourself.  In any case, I was once interested in solving them, especially since they arose not as abstract questions, but as methods of solving specific problems.  If the search process does not entice you and the finished result is much more important, then you can immediately see the answers under the spoiler. <a name="habracut"></a><br><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">How to increase / reduce the image by mail.ru</b> <div class="spoiler_text">  Photos uploaded to the community post on mail.ru are automatically compressed to 600 px.  In this case, downloaded screenshots in some cases become completely unreadable (clickable) <br><br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/544/e6a/1ce/544e6a1ce857e016f4444fab0d1585ec.jpg"></a> <br>  It seems that the author has already tried to edit the screen, but the result was not very successful.  His question dealt with the problems with the removal of Opera, but it‚Äôs impossible to understand what the feature of the installed browser is and why it cannot be removed in the usual way from the loaded screen. <br>  But in this version (clickable) the screen is quite readable: <br><br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/544/e6a/1ce/544e6a1ce857e016f4444fab0d1585ec.jpg"></a> <br>  Notice that both screens are actually the same photo. <br><br>  Compare the three links: <br>  <a href="">content.foto.mail.ru/mail/irbris/_blogs/i-14644.jpg</a> <br>  <a href="">content.foto.mail.ru/mail/irbris/_blogs/s-14644.jpg</a> <br>  <a href="">content.foto.mail.ru/mail/irbris/_blogs/p-14644.jpg</a> <br><br>  As you can see, they differ only in one letter after the last slash in the image address: <br>  " <b>i</b> " is a compressed image by mil; <br>  " <b>s</b> " - image in original size; <br>  " <b>p</b> " - a small picture preview. <br>  Editing links from one image to another. </div></div><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">How to make a photo slideshow on mail.ru</b> <div class="spoiler_text"> Once on mail.ru there was an opportunity to create your own slideshow - the only one that could be loaded into a post or comment.  In the process of updating photo albums, this opportunity would seem to have disappeared.  In fact, it remained, albeit hidden from most users. <br><br>  In order to create a slideshow of photos uploaded to the album on mail.ru, you need to go back to the old photo album design.  This can be done in different ways.  The simplest of them is to right-click on a photo from an album and select in the context menu: ‚ÄúOpen in a new tab‚Äù <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/0b0/507/c56/0b0507c5646a39be4b0cd9f0d8c34aa3.jpg"><br><br>  In the old photo album design, the Slideshow button is located in the upper right corner: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/51f/f95/942/51ff95942188492622da8c571ec79e31.jpg"><br><br>  Click "Get Code" and "Post to Blog" <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/781/7e7/c47/7817e7c471c961a2d20b2b6e5666f6c1.jpg"><br><br>  Unfortunately, after the opportunity to create posts and write comments to Blogs@mail.ru was stopped on December 23, 2013, this way of creating a slideshow stopped working.  However, you can still create a slideshow by editing the code. <br>  The code for <a href="http://my.mail.ru/community/compi./63DD2B4B30A818BB.html">this slideshow is</a> : <br><br> <code>&lt;slideshow author_email="irbris@mail.ru" album_url="851" hrefXML="http://foto.mail.ru/mail/irbris/851/list.xml"&gt;</code> <br> <br>  It shows and can be changed url photo album, user e-mail address of the album. <br><br>  The Maylovskoye slideshow is quite functional: you can scroll through a click or start automatic playback, specify the time to view the photo, expand it to full screen, get the embed code on the website and livejournal, go to the photo album, increase or decrease the size of the viewed photos, there is a bottom The preview tape in the upper right corner indicates the number of photos in the album and the total number of photos. <br><br> <a href="http://my.mail.ru/community/compi./63DD2B4B30A818BB.html"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/fe7/ca0/45c/fe7ca045c27818be8ceeba5399572c26.jpg"></a> </div></div><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">How to download music from My World to a computer using browser tools</b> <div class="spoiler_text">  In addition to downloading music using browser add-ons or programs designed for this, mail.ru has the ability to download music using the browser.  To do this, we upload the audio track to the community post (HTML tab) and copy the link in the resulting code (highlighted in the screenshot): <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/a77/6ea/06a/a776ea06ac41e0e8a60f87f151d20558.jpg"><br><br>  Example of a link for downloading music: <a href="">http://music24.my.mail.ru/file/1415223dc3d5c02144f89ab1f647e02b.mp3</a> <br>  When you click on this link, depending on the browser and its version, either the save file window immediately appears, or the player opens with music, which you can click with the right mouse button and select ‚ÄúSave audio‚Äù in the context menu </div></div><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">How to upload flash-animation to mail.ru</b> <div class="spoiler_text">  Mail.ru does not have the ability to add flash objects to an entry in the community.  But if you can not, but really want, then you can. <br>  For unknown reasons, a code for inserting information from the site <a href="http://iii.ru/login">iii.ru/login passes</a> on <a href="http://iii.ru/login">mail.ru.</a>  In addition to the mail you can download the same flash mail card with an address that begins on <a href="http://images.cards.mail.ru/">http://images.cards.mail.ru</a> <br><br>  Code to insert a flash drive: <br><br> <code><a href="http://my.mail.ru/community/compi./455AD01AA8FAD56A.html"></a> <br> <br>  () <br> <br> <img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/595/dbd/a4d/595dbda4dcde5c444a3736b9955ad672.jpg"> <br> <br>     -,     mail.ru,       .     ,       -  mail.ru.</code> <br> <div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">How to make a table cell fill color</b> <div class="spoiler_text">  Sometimes it seems that mail.ru lives according to its own laws known only to him.  And the HTML language is also his own, different from that adopted on other sites.  The tags allowed on mail.ru can be seen <a href="http://www.stm.dp.ua/web-design/color-html.php">here</a> , and there are very few of them.  As for the other working tags, they are determined experimentally.  For example, it is known that you can add an HTML table to mail.ru.  The <i>background</i> attribute (fill the table with a picture) on mail.ru works, and the attributes <i>bgcolor</i> (fill color) and <i>bordercolor</i> (frame color) do not work. <br><br>  In order to be able to apply a color to a cell in a table, we use styles. <br>  Code: <br><br> <code><br>    <br>  , <br>   ,  . <br></code> <br><br>  Displayed as: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/d1c/c54/7b3/d1cc547b3c1214f16c3f95de869c4210.png"><br><br>  This code indicates and can be changed: <br><br>  <i>border: 3px</i> - the width of the frame; <br>  <i>double</i> - frame type (other values: <i>inset, outset, dotted, dashed, double, groove, ridge, solid</i> ); <br>  <i># A2B5CD</i> - frame color; <br>  <i>background: # F8F8FF</i> - background color; <br>  <i>width: 400px</i> - width; <br>  <i>padding: 8px</i> - the distance from the frame to the text. <br><br>  When we made the community menu, we set ourselves the task: to make it as easy as possible so that it loads quickly even at low Internet speeds (for some community members, the Internet is simply deadly slow).  And they did, of course.  This <a href="http://my.mail.ru/community/compi/67CD4EDAF93E6214.html">menu</a> is a clean code and two tiny pictures, weighing 2.5 and 0.3 KB, respectively.  At the same time, it looks no worse than fancy menus from pictures that are used in communities on mail.ru, and weighs a hundred times less and loads instantly. </div></div><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">How to remove spacing in the table between rows</b> <div class="spoiler_text">  About two years ago, an unpleasant feature appeared on mail.ru: gaps between rows of a table, a pixel width of four.  They are displayed even with the directly specified parameters: <i>border = "0" cellpadding = "0" cellspacing = "0"</i> and it is impossible to remove them in the usual way, because they should not be. <br>  The community menu turned into a lined drawing: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/f94/c60/1b3/f94c601b32ad0570450850756a542a67.png"><br><br>  The problem has so far been solved by setting the table background (attribute <i>background</i> ) to some image that served as a background, so that the gaps between the cells are not so noticeable. <br>  But it turns out that these gaps can be completely eliminated. <br><br>  The usual code for a picture placed in 4 cells of a 2x2 table looks like this: <br><br> <code><code><code><br> <br> <img src="http://content.foto.mail.ru/mail/irbris/_blogs/i-3939.jpg"></code> <br> <code><img src="http://content.foto.mail.ru/mail/irbris/_blogs/i-3940.jpg"></code> <br></code> <br> <code><code><br> <img src="http://content.foto.mail.ru/mail/irbris/_blogs/i-3941.jpg"></code> <br> <code><img src="http://content.foto.mail.ru/mail/irbris/_blogs/i-3942.jpg"></code> <br></code> <br></code> <br><br>  If you add this code to an entry in the community, a white bar appears between the rows of the table: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/c32/918/a23/c32918a23eb04093205a754673df04a8.jpg"><br><br>  And this is what the table code looks like without spaces between the lines: <br><br> <code><code><br> <br> <br> <br></code> <br> <code><br> <br> <br></code> <br></code> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/f74/a42/feb/f74a42feb3acc29acab5066c0300bec5.jpg"></div></div><br>  Perhaps, from the point of view of specialists, these life hacks for mail.ru look primitive and naive, the explanations seem too simple, and errors have crept into the codes.  Only by education and occupation, I have nothing to do with computers, programming and technology in general.  I know everything I know about computers and the Internet on mail.ru and thanks to mail.ru. <br>  Notice, I do not idealize mail.ru.  This site has flaws, and I know about them, probably more than anyone else.  But a social network that makes you think and look for ways to solve problems is a lot. <br><br>  If you know other undocumented features of the mail.ru site, tell us about them, please, - very interesting. <br>  If you do not use mail.ru (or do not dare to admit it) - tell me if there are undocumented features in the Habr√©. <br>  I wonder if gentlemen know geeks about their site as much as mail.ru users know about theirs. <br><br>  <b>UPD</b> : and another mail brings character.  So the post in the drafts will not clean.  But I would like to see the comments. </div></div></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/207372/">https://habr.com/ru/post/207372/</a></p>
