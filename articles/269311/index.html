      No sooner said than done.  Having looked through the <a href="http://www.ecma-international.org/publications/standards/Ecma-130.htm">ECMA-130</a> standard (there is, by the way, the domestic standard: <a href="http://gostrf.com/normadata/1/4294827/4294827044.pdf">GOST 27667-88</a> ) found a lot of interesting details.  For example, I guessed about redundancy, but I could not even think that for recording <b>700 MB of</b> data ‚Äúin reality‚Äù <b>1943 MB is</b> recorded (That is, <b>2.776</b> times more) ... <br><br>  Schematically, the whole stack can be represented by the picture: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/ced/1e6/f11/ced1e6f1166149df982efc79b699c3fe.png"><br><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  The stack will be viewed from the top down. <br>  That is, from the moment of data transfer to the drive before recording the pits themselves. <br>  It should be said that not all the disk area is used for recording / storing / reading information. <br>  The compact disk is divided into <b><abbr title="Translation &quot;zone&quot; and not &quot;area&quot; is used in GOST 27667-88 (drawing_1)">zones</abbr></b> ( <b>areas</b> ): <br><ol><li>  <b>Center Hole (Center Hole)</b> is the ‚Äúsame hole‚Äù with a diameter of <b>15</b> mm (¬± <b>0.1</b> mm) for which the disc itself is attached. <br></li><li>  <b>First transition area</b> - ‚Äúring‚Äù, between <b>15</b> and <b>20</b> mm from the center of the disk. <br></li><li>  <b>Clamping area (Clamping area)</b> - as the name implies, this area is necessary so that the disk ‚Äúdoes not skip‚Äù when reading / writing.  (26-33 mm) <br></li><li>  <b>The second transition area</b> is the ‚Äúsecond ring‚Äù, between <b>33</b> and <b>44</b> mm from the center of the disk. <br></li><li>  <b>The information area</b> is the ‚Äúinformational useful‚Äù part of the CD.  It is located at a distance of <b>44</b> mm to <b>118</b> mm from the center. <br></li><li>  <b>Rim area (rim)</b> - the last area.  It is a ring from <b>118</b> mm to <b>120</b> mm from the center. <br></li></ol><br><br>  It <i>is the information zone that</i> is interesting <i>to</i> us, therefore, we will speak about it in more detail.  <i>The information area</i> is divided into the following ‚Äúsubzones‚Äù: <br><ul><li>  inner buffer zone </li><li>  user data zone </li><li>  outer buffer zone </li></ul><br><br>  All three translations are made by GOST ... So I will not translate from myself.  What does the ‚Äúprogram‚Äù mean? When it comes to data, I cannot attach my mind.  If someone on Habr√© can answer me why the <b>user data zone</b> was transferred as a ‚Äúprogram zone‚Äù, I would be extremely grateful! <br><br>  Phew ... With the physical education program, I hope, done away with.  Of course, I missed many points related to widths and lengths;  with coating method;  beam wavelength;  and other physical properties.  However, firstly, this is not the purpose of this article;  secondly, I myself have not yet dismantled more than half of the information.  Yes, and no desire, to be honest ... My curiosity is purely "programmer" orientation;) <br><br><h1>  Information Tracks </h1><br><br>  The first phase is the splitting into ‚Äúinformational tracks‚Äù.  Already there are two options for recording, in digital form ( <b>Digital Data Tracks, DDT</b> ) and audio data ( <b>Audio Tracks</b> ). <br>  In the future we will consider only digital data.  All following information is correct only for <b>DDT</b> . <br><br><h1>  Sector </h1><br><br>  Data is divided into 8 bits (one byte each) and grouped into <b>sectors</b> . <br>  It's funny that the number of sectors in the disk is not defined by the standard.  It depends on how much data to ‚Äúget‚Äù to write to disk ... <br><br>  This seems a bit ridiculous.  Nevertheless, various companies used to detect counterfeit disks used this absurdity in their time.  (Since this is ‚Äúgoing aside,‚Äù I wrote in more detail under the spoiler just below, at the end of the chapter.) <br><br>  Of course, the length of the track is more or less fixed and, in general, <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/QoS">QoS</a> can be guaranteed. <br><br>  There are three ways (mode) to write data in sectors: <br><ul><li>  <b>Sector Mode (00)</b> is an empty sector filled with data, consisting of 0x00 bytes. </li><li>  <b>Sector Mode (01)</b> - use <b>EDC</b> , <b>PQ</b> and <b>CIRC</b> coding.  (more on that below) </li><li>  <b>Sector Mode (02)</b> - no P and Q coding, only <b>CIRC</b> coding </li></ul><br><br>  Here are the pictures: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/50b/16c/119/50b16c1198e943e3a7d58b82a8d53f0b.png"><br><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Counterfeit Detection Method</b> <div class="spoiler_text">  The method, like all brilliant, is simple. <br><br>  <b>Record license key</b> . <br><ol><li>  You must first write all the necessary information to disk. </li><li>  Then we select 2 sectors.  For example 103123 and 120234 sectors.  Denote these sectors as <b>A</b> and <b>B.</b> </li><li>  Select two bytes: one byte on each sector.  For example, the 4th byte of the first sector and the 8th byte of the second </li><li>  Then, calculate the <b>angle</b> between these bytes in the sector.  How to do it?  Suppose you have access to a low-level reading driver and you know the time of one turn. Then you should calculate the time spent reading between <b>A</b> and <b>B.</b>  Dividing this time by the time of one revolution, it is possible to calculate the angle with a certain error. </li><li>  The value of the angle, rounded to a certain sign, is fed to the input of the <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%25A5%25D0%25B5%25D1%2588%25D0%25B8%25D1%2580%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B2%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B5">hash function</a> .  The hash values ‚Äã‚Äãare taken several characters, for example, the last 3 characters. </li><li>  These three characters are written to the license key. </li></ol><br><br>  <b>License key verification procedure</b> . <br><ol><li>  The user is asked to enter the license key. </li><li>  Calculate the angle between the selected bytes <b>A</b> and <b>B</b> sectors </li><li>  We calculate the checked list of angles.  For example, we calculated an angle of 33.343 ¬∞.  Suppose that rounding is accurate to a degree.  Round and get 33 ¬∞.  Suppose the error is ¬± 2 ¬∞.  List of angles: [31 ¬∞, 32 ¬∞, 33 ¬∞, 34 ¬∞, 35 ¬∞]. </li><li>  For each corner from the list, we calculate the hash.  Take a few characters from the hash.  For example, last 3 characters. <br>  If at least one hash from the list coincided with the hash from the license key, then we conclude that the disk is licensed.  Otherwise the disk is counterfeit. <br></li></ol><br></div></div><br><br><h1>  Error correction (Sector Mode 01 only) </h1><br><br>  Useful Information ( <b>User Mode</b> ) consists of <b>2048</b> bytes in <b>01</b> mode;  or <b>2336</b> bytes in <b>02</b> mode. <br>  Which mode to choose?  It all depends on what reliability requirement you require. <br>  Sector Mode 01 is more reliable as it uses additional <b>EDC</b> checking and <b>PQ</b> coding. <br><br><h2>  EDC </h2><br><br>  <b>Error Detection Code (EDC)</b> , as the name implies, is intended only for detection, but not for error correction. <br><br>  Here is its polynomial: <b>P (x) = (x <sup>16</sup> + x <sup>15</sup> + x <sup>2</sup> +1) (x <sup>16</sup> + x <sup>2</sup> + x + 1)</b> <br><br><h2>  Intermediate </h2><br><br>  Eight bytes of the <b>Intermediate</b> field are filled with zero bytes ( <b>0x00</b> ). <br>  I really don‚Äôt know why they were left ... Maybe ‚Äúin reserve‚Äù (they like it in IT standards), <s>but maybe this is a cunning plan for steganographic data transfer.</s> <br><br><h2>  P and Q coding (RSPC) </h2><br><br>  <b>Reed-Solomon Product-like Code (RSPC)</b> , it is also <b>P + Q</b> encoding used from <b>12</b> to <b>2075</b> bytes of data in mode <b>01</b> .  I will omit the details, you can read them in <a href="http://www.ecma-international.org/publications/files/ECMA-ST/Ecma-130.pdf">Annex A of the ECMA-130 standard</a> . <br><br>  Bytes <b>12</b> through <b>2075</b> and test <b>2 076</b> through <b>2 351</b> make up <b>2340</b> bytes of data.  This data is divided into two blocks of <b>1170</b> bytes each.  Fragmentation occurs as in school physical education classes.  " <i>On perrrvyy- vtorrrroy pay!</i> ".  That is, odd and even bytes. <br><br>  Next comes the encoding of external and internal codes.  External is called <b>P-coding</b> , internal <b>Q-coding</b> . <br><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Picture with P and Q encoding</b> <div class="spoiler_text"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/683/2ca/ead/6832caead6fe4c6abfe2396270db2a3c.png"><br></div></div><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">For more understanding: the picture is only with Q encoding</b> <div class="spoiler_text"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/f02/bcc/b17/f02bccb17ef2483a9ca207e32aace0a9.png"><br></div></div><br><br>  The most difficult in understanding of the <b>ECMA-130</b> stack is passed.  Now it will be much easier. <br><br><h1>  Scrambling </h1><br><br>  Go to scramble.  This is one scrambling sector: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/544/3a7/3c8/5443a73c8148487c8a3d55464c667084.png"><br><br>  Each such sector is called the <b>Scrambled Sector</b> . <br><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">And what is ‚Äúscrambling‚Äù and why is it necessary?</b> <div class="spoiler_text">  On the meaning of scrambling briefly and succinctly <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/225593/">in a comment to one of my posts</a> wrote <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/users/snapdragon/" class="user_link">snapdragon</a> <br><blockquote>  Scrambler is needed to make the spectrum of the signal uniform.  Otherwise, with homogeneous data (for example, many repeating ones or zeros), the signal energy will be concentrated in a narrow range. <br></blockquote><br></div></div><br><br><h1>  F <sub>1</sub> , F <sub>2</sub> and F <sub>3</sub> frames </h1><br><br>  Each <b>Scrambled Sector is</b> broken into frames, <b>24</b> bytes each. <br>  These frame'y have the name: <b>F <sub>1</sub> frame</b> . <br>  Each <b>Scrambled Sector</b> we have consists of <b>2352</b> bytes. <br>  Accordingly, each sector is divided into <b>98</b> frames. <br><br><h2>  CIRC coding (F <sub>2</sub> frame) </h2><br>  <b>Cross Interleaved Reed-Solomon (CIRC)</b> coding is performed for each <b>F <sub>1</sub> frame</b> . <br>  This code corrects errors with an input word length of <b>24</b> bytes and an output word length of <b>32</b> bytes. <br>  Moreover, unlike <b>EDC</b> and <b>RSPC</b> coding, <b>CIRC</b> coding is applied to all <b>Sector Mode</b> . <br>  The resulting sequence of <b>32</b> bytes is called the <b>F <sub>2</sub> frame</b> . <br><br><h2>  Check byte </h2><br>  One check byte is added to the beginning of each <b>F <sub>2</sub> frame</b> , and it turns out an <b>F <sub>3</sub> frame</b> with a length of <b>33</b> bytes (32 + 1 = 33). <br><br><h1>  8-to-14 encoding </h1><br>  At this stage, the data each byte (8 bits) is converted to 14 bits of data.  Conversion is carried out according to the table. <br><br>  I will not give the whole table, you can find it in <a href="http://www.ecma-international.org/publications/files/ECMA-ST/Ecma-130.pdf">Annex D of the ECMA-130 standard</a> . <br><br><pre><code class="sql hljs">... ... 00010000 10000000100000 00010001 10000010000000 00010010 10010010000000 00010011 00100000100000 00010100 01000010000000 00010101 00000010000000 00010110 00010010000000 ... ...</code> </pre> <br><br>  Why the need for 8-to-14 coding is not specified in the standard.  (The standard and does not have to answer the questions WHY, the standard should have answers to questions HOWLY) ... <br><br>  I have one hypothesis.  The fact is that the real world is not as ‚Äúperfect‚Äù as programmers see it.  For example, a drawn point is a small ‚Äúblob‚Äù, and a drawn line always has an area;  otherwise our eyes would not see the point and the line ... For this reason, I would venture to make a number of assumptions.  I emphasize that I have never worked professionally with the manufacture of CD discs.  These are just assumptions.  (Discussion in comments is absolutely welcome!). <br><br>  Hypotheses. <br><ol><li>  Pete is not "perfect" burned on the surface of the disk, so you need some space next to the pit, because  for this space, a burned pit can ‚Äújump in‚Äù. </li><li>  Most likely, there are certain problems with the synchronization of the head itself. Too many consecutive zeros are bad. </li><li>  Perhaps a large number of units is an additional "load" on the read head.  Therefore, their reduction will significantly increase the life of the CD drive.  On average, we have 4 units of 8 bits of data.  In 8-to-14 coding in a <i>code word</i> , we have 1 or 2 units.  That is two times less. </li></ol><br><br><h1>  Counting redundancy </h1><br><br>  Let's see how redundant the CD protocol is: <br><ol><li>  Depending on Sector Mode: <ul><li>  <b>Sector Mode 01</b> (PQ coding) - At the input of a block of <b>2048</b> bytes, at the output of <b>2352</b> .  Therefore redundancy is: <b><sup>2352/2048</sup> = 1.148</b> </li><li>  <b>Sector Mode 02</b> (without PQ coding) - <b><sub>2352/2336</sub> = 1.007</b> </li></ul></li><li>  <b>Scrambling</b> is a trifle, but for the order we take into account: <b><sup>(12 + 2340)</sup> / <sub>2340</sub> = 1.005</b> </li><li>  <b>F <sub>1</sub> -F <sub>2</sub> -F <sub>3</sub> frames</b> - <b>33/24 = 1.375</b> </li><li>  <b>8-to-14 encoding</b> - <b>14/8 = 1.750</b> </li></ol><br><br>  Multiplying everything, we get: 1.148 ‚ãÖ 1.005 ‚ãÖ 1.375 ‚ãÖ 1.750 = <b>2.776</b> .  Thus, the disc itself is recorded as a <b>result 2.776</b> times more information than ‚Äúuseful information‚Äù. <br>  For example, if the amount of ‚Äúuseful information‚Äù is <b>700</b> MB, <b>1943</b> MB of data is actually recorded on the disk. <br><br>  For Sector Mode 02, PQ coding is not used.  For this mode, the redundancy is: 1.007 ‚ãÖ 1.005 ‚ãÖ 1.375 1.750 = <b>2.435</b> . <br><br><h1>  Bonus: SCSI Multimedia Commands </h1><br><br>  There is a standard <a href="http://hackipedia.org/Hardware/SCSI/Multimedia/SCSI%2520Multimedia%2520Commands%2520-%25206.pdf">SCSI Multimedia Commands</a> .  It describes the commands for raw data reading.  The <b>READ CD</b> and <b>WRITE CD</b> commands allow you to read 2,352 bytes of data from the entire sector.  However, I did not find the commands for reading the F-fraims ... In principle, if you write redundant information for which partial losses are not terrible (for example, video, telematics) <br>  you can do without <b>F <sub>1</sub> -F <sub>2</sub> -F <sub>3</sub> frames by</b> increasing the ‚Äúpayload‚Äù <b>1.375</b> times. <br><br>  There are also a number of unused areas in the CD (for example, the same <b>Intermidiate</b> ), which can also be used.  For example, for the tasks of steganography. <br><br>  Unfortunately I did not find the OpenSource code that implements these features ... <br>  If there are specialists on this issue on the Habr√©, I will be glad to receive a reference (plus me in karma). </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/269311/">https://habr.com/ru/post/269311/</a></p>
