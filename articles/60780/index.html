  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Excursion to nic.lv - continuation of the topic of ‚Äúdomain theft‚Äù</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  The development of the <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/domains/57315/">topic of nic.lv</a> and situations with doubles of applications for domains. We had a meeting with employees of nic.lv with <a href="http://www.barsmedia.net/">Bars</a> related to the investigation of the ‚Äúdomain theft‚Äù.  Yes, I hardly believe in coincidences, but studying several of the four facts known to me with the one-day registration of the same .lv domain did not reveal any connection between the cases. <br><br>  Therefore, we went to the meeting on April 28, 2009 without evidence - but with some complaints.  The most important thing: is it really so difficult to signal the user that a domain application has already been received for the domain he is going to buy? <br>  We were met more than welcome.  Many thanks to Baiba Kashkina and Katrina Sataki, as well as to two charming girls - administrators, whose names I cannot name, (therefore we will call them beautiful strangers), for going forward and attentively listening.  The second thanks - for taking our advice into consideration and some of them are already working on the site nic.lv <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  It was about the fact that a customer who buys a domain is unlikely to believe that someone has registered his chosen domain a little earlier.  Most likely - will feel deceived and robbed, as happened in our cases.  And the only way out of this situation is to signal the user that the domain he chose has already been booked.  Ideally, with a whois request or in a web-based employment verification form.  Since before the entry into force of the new rules on the liberalization of the sale of domains, there are very few - the check for compliance with registered firms and trademarks will not occur and the waiting time for registration acceptance will decrease. <br><br>  Lists of requests for domains in the web admin panel and much more were also discussed.  Bars generously zeportil bug associated with ... (cut).  After a very short period of time after the meeting, I received a message stating that some of the features we proposed began to work: 
      <br>
        <script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>
        <ins class="adsbygoogle"
          style="display:block; text-align:center;"
          data-ad-layout="in-article"
          data-ad-format="fluid"
          data-ad-client="ca-pub-6974184241884155"
          data-ad-slot="8945601208"></ins>
        <script>
          (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
        </script>
      <br>
      When registering a domain, the number of applications submitted for it, but not yet processed, is shown.  (What the doctor ordered, I just haven't tried it yet ... You can experiment with the domain from the list of those who already have applications for which they have already released) <br>  Counters of applications appeared in the list of released domains: you can see that 2 have already been received on bigtits.lv, which is one request for each item.  But the domain will receive the first application that has sent, if the "big boobs" will not be on the list of European brands: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/5cd/938/190/5cd93819014c5949908ab06bb8b7b598.png"><br><br>  And bezbileta.lv is still free and waiting for its hare.  Whether the crisis so affects squatters and webmasters lose their solvency, or webmasters finally realize that they are not squatters - there are quite a lot of vacant domains with ‚Äútasty‚Äù and not so names. <br><br>  <strong>Well, on July 1st the .lv domain market will not be childishly stirred up.</strong>  After all, the check on the register of enterprises and European brands can be completely forgotten.  Liberalization, however.  ‚ÄúCome ‚Äî whoever wants, take what you want‚Äù And then for the disputed domains, if you wish, courts, duels, or other ways of restoring justice.  Undoubtedly, paradise for squatters and unprecedented sales growth. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/60780/">https://habr.com/ru/post/60780/</a></p>
