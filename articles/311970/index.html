It would be great to check on the same data, but the authors do not publish them as an appendix to the article, and collecting them yourself is quite a lot of work.  So far I have decided to go another way - to eliminate the problem variable from the study design. </p><br><p>  I checked whether there is a similar pattern in Europe at the country level.

In the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/boris.denisov/posts/10211165163664105">discussion with him was</a> born the idea to check the pattern in Europe.  Checked  The results are interesting.  And he began to think where to publish.  Once again, I came to the conclusion that there is no better option for the habr.  I understand that the topic is likely to interest the smaller part of the audience of the community.  And yet I hope for a benevolent attitude and valuable comments - I really want to hear opinions "from the side."  As for the categorization of the article - I think, on the Habr√©, the Academy (the Academy) would not interfere with the hub (or even the stream) ( <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/post/306790/">wrote from this earlier in the commentary</a> ). </p><br><p>  In my defense, I can say that those who are not interested in demography will find in this post an <code>R</code> code that automatically downloads population data from two excellent databases - Eurostat and the Human Mortality Database and reproduces all charts, including maps.

(2016).  Marriage markets and male mantra effort: violence and violence are elevated where men are rare.  Human Nature, 1‚Äì12.  <a href="https://doi.org/10.1007/s12110-016-9271-x">https://doi.org/10.1007/s12110-016-9271-x</a> </p><br><p>  After examining the sex ratio in the adult population of the counties of the USA (more than 3 thousand administrative districts) and data on the commission of serious crimes, Ryan Schacht, Douglas Tharp and Ken Smith concluded that there is a clear correlation between the indicators - the more men, the fewer crimes ( Table 1). </p><br><p>  <b>Table 1.

For decades this intuitive presentation has been rather groundless, or rather speculatively, dominated in sociological works.  In contrast to these theoretical constructs, there are relatively recent theories that are based on modeling marriage markets that predict an inverse relationship.  Recently revised sociological theories of marriage markets predict a negative effect from an excess of women and insufficient competition among men.  The empirical research of Mine et al. Is consistent with this spiral of modern scientific literature.  The logic is approximately the following: the abundance of women leads to a decrease in the efforts put by men to form pairs, which in turn leads to a disorderly life and a general increase in crime. </p><br><p>  Source: <a href="http://demoscope.ru/weekly/2016/0699/digest01.php">My Demographic Digest in Demoscope magazine</a> </p></div></div><br><p>  Despite the beauty of analyzing small areas (other things being equal, it is always more pleasant to analyze more fractional data), there are big doubts about the possible missing variable in the study - the division of American counties on the principle of centrality / peripherality (urban / rural). </p><br><p>  The fact is that women are more active than men in internal migration.

For illustration, here is a map of Russia from <a href="https://www.academia.edu/9872746">my master‚Äôs work</a> (Fig. 1). </p><br><p></p><div style="text-align:center;"> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/824/9df/1eb/8249df1ebe14474fb570d23c104547e5.png" width="100%"></a> </div><p></p><br><p>  <strong>Figure 1.</strong> Sex ratio between the ages of 16-29 years in municipalities and cities of Russia according to the 2010 All-Russian Population Census.  (clickable) </p><br><p>  As we see, there are more women in cities (there are regional centers, where there are more men, but, as a rule, this is explained by military units ‚Äî a separate topic).  And this is despite the fact that there are always more boys born than girls, and at a young age there are more boys in general.  But more on that later.  So, thanks to internal migration, women are concentrated in cities. </p><br><p>  And in the cities, crime is higher.  There are a lot of reasons (mostly different sociological theories about isolation from the environment), but there is no need to prove this thesis. </p><br><p>  So, in my opinion, in the study of Mine, Tharp and Smith, the key difference between the city and the periphery is probably missing.  In cities, there is more crime because it is a city, and not because there are more women and less men.  It is possible that the inclusion of the variable urban / rural in the explanatory model neutralizes the observed effect. </p><br><p>  But in order to check whether this is so, one must have the same data that the researchers used.  Probably do it sometime later.  In the meantime, <a href="https://www.facebook.com/boris.denisov/posts/10211165163664105">in the discussion</a> we came to the conclusion that it would be interesting to check the revealed dependence on the data of European countries.  The transition to the level of countries should largely solve the effects of migration. </p><br><h2 id="proverka-na-evropeyskih-dannyh">  Check on European data </h2><br><p>  So, the idea is to check the identified relationship on the data on population and crime of European countries.  The transition to a higher level of data aggregation is intended to solve the issue of the classification of territories into central and peripheral. </p><br><p>  <strong>Data</strong> </p><br><ul><li>  population age structure - <a href="http://www.mortality.org/">Human Mortality Database</a> (we are interested in the Exposure-to-risk indicator); </li><li>  data on the number of murders in European countries - <a href="http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/data/database">Eurostat</a> (dataset of interest to us is called "crim_gen", it is easier to download <a href="http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/estat-navtree-portlet-prod/BulkDownloadListing%3Fsort%3D1%26amp%3Bdir%3Ddata">here</a> ). </li></ul><br><p>  Data from the two bases intersected in 28 countries (in fact, 26, just Scotland and Northern Ireland are present in the statistics separately).  Not bad.  There is data, then everything is simple.  We calculate the ASR, adult sex ratio, the ratio of men to women aged 15-49 years (the authors of the Human Nature article use the age range 15-49 years; deviation from their methodology is dictated by the characteristics of Eurostat data) and HR, Homicide Rate, homicide rate per 100 Thousands of people of the local population. </p><br><p>  Next is linear regression.  I know that the authors use a more sophisticated statistical model, but for the beginning we will go in a simple way. </p><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">A bit about choosing the type of regression model</b> <div class="spoiler_text"><p>  The fact is that the Poisson regression has a lot of meaning when there are many values ‚Äã‚Äãin a large data array, close to zero or zero.  For the analysis of American counties, this is indeed a significant difficulty.  In our analysis of countries, it is quite possible to limit ourselves to a simple linear regression. </p><br><p>  Who is interested in the question of the applicability of the Poisson regression for modeling processes with low probabilities (small coefficients), pay attention to the classic article. </p><br><ul><li>  Welch, BL (1951).  On the comparison of several mean values: an alternative approach.  Biometrika, 330‚Äì336.  Retrieved from <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/2332579">http://www.jstor.org/stable/2332579</a> </li></ul><br><p>  The method is widely applicable in epidemiology.  I used Poisson regressions in my recent study of the influx of migrants to Moscow.  There is just such a situation: when we consider migration flows separately for men / women, five-year age groups and 125 districts of the city, it often turns out that combinations of all signs give zero coefficients.  Therefore, it is convenient to use Poisson regression.

And this suggests the need for additional verification (but this is at the end of the article). </p><br><p>  The prevalence of homicides in Europe varies greatly between East and West (Fig. 3).  In the Baltic countries, the indicator is so much higher than in the rest of Europe (Fig. 3-A) that we have to exclude them (Fig. 3-B) from the regression analysis as outright emissions. </p><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/d40/5b9/7b0/d405b97b071e4798a16be7bf8a1decf1.png" width="100%"></div><br><p>  <strong>Figure 3</strong> .

Here we are likely to encounter once again the manifestation of the influence of migration, but this time migration is international.  Another of the laws of migration Ravenstein-Lee argues that in international migration, by contrast, men are more active.  It is possible that the results of my small verification were distorted from international migration.

They simulate the extinction of a hypothetical generation.  Suppose we calculate the CU for country A in the year X. The baseline is the age-specific mortality rate in the year X. Next, we model the extinction of the conditional generation (usually taken as 100K, but this is not important), assuming that to die with the intensity characteristic of the inhabitants of country A at the appropriate age in the year X. </p><br><p>  The beauty of the CU is that the estimates based on it (the best known is life expectancy) do not depend on the age structure of the population.  Thus, it is possible to correctly compare the mortality of completely different populations, for example, very old Japan and very young Nigeria. </p><br><p>  Of course, the CU can be calculated separately for men and women, yes, in general, for any population - there would be data. </p></div></div><br><p>  We calculate the sex ratio in adulthood as the ratio of the number of men and women according to the mortality table multiplied by the initial sex ratio at birth. </p><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">A little about the sex ratio at birth</b> <div class="spoiler_text"><p>  Boys are always and everywhere born more than girls.  This is an immutable law of nature.  On average, 106 boys are born per 100 girls. </p><br><p>  In fairness, we note that, as a rule, male mortality is higher than female mortality at all ages.  Therefore, at a certain age, the sex ratio is equalized. </p><br><p>  This is how the average sex ratio at birth looked in our countries in 1990‚Äì2010 (Fig. 6). </p><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/05f/619/a94/05f619a9419b4d858b4c4d158f7acd08.png" width="100%"></div><br><p>  <strong>Figure 6</strong> .
