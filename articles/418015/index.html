  <section class="page js-page"><h1>New Vasyuki. Innovative development of Moscow until 2100</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/u9/qk/2e/u9qk2enryt8xp-vm_vkfc7rvrgu.jpeg"><br><br>  Experts from the international consulting group <i>The Boston Consulting Group</i> proposed a number of ‚Äúvisionary‚Äù measures for the innovative development of Moscow in the digital economy.  These measures are listed in the report ‚ÄúMoscow Competitiveness Study in the Sphere of New Economy‚Äù, which was <a href="https://www.rbc.ru/economics/24/07/2018/5b55f8fa9a79475252c367c7">received by</a> RBC.  Experts prepared a report on their own initiative to the Moscow Urban Forum. <br><br>  Based on the best world practices and expert assessments, BGC offers 11 main directions for the further development of the new economy. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><ol><li>  Creation of the quarter "Moscow-2100" with unmanned vehicles and air taxis.  Permission on the territory of the quarter of helicopters and airplanes with the technology of vertical takeoff and landing, including unmanned. </li><li>  Introduction of an ‚Äúisolated climatic zone‚Äù and other innovative urban and technological solutions in the quarter.  For example, the launch of technology "smart home" in the entire quarter.  An isolated climate zone will regulate the climate and create a comfortable living environment throughout the year, including in winter. </li><li>  Run the Hyperloop train to the nearest regions, including Tver, Vladimir and Kaluga.  Due to this, Moscow is turning into a large agglomeration with a population of 30 million people (now 16.9 million people live in this territory). </li><li>  Launching an innovative transformation program for metropolitan companies.  Attraction of highly qualified specialists.  Promotion of entrepreneurship. </li><li>  Opening overseas offices in places where Russian-speaking talent is concentrated (for example, in Silicon Valley) to return them to Russia.  However, even without their specialists returning home, the Russian capital is already developing very successfully and is one of the leading cities in the world: ‚ÄúMoscow is ahead of all other megacities ... in terms of the increase in the share of jobs in the Knowledge category, which is a crucial factor for the successful development of new economy, ‚Äùthe report <a href="https://ria.ru/economy/20180724/1525180760.html">said</a> .  In terms of the share of people employed in R &amp; D, Moscow (3.5%) is comparable to Paris (3.8%) and Berlin (3%).  In terms of the share of companies implementing technological innovations, the Russian capital reached the level of South Korea (19%), having increased it by one and a half times during the period 2011-2017. </li><li>  Digitalization of government agencies.  Discovery of urban data for private business (for example, statistics of passenger traffic and criminal activity by districts). </li><li>  Creating a brand <i>Designed in Moscow</i> . </li><li>  Transformation of technology parks.  The study notes that the provision of Moscow with technopark zones exceeds practically all of the sample cities, with the exception of Berlin.  The quality of the technopark infrastructure, in terms of benefits, subsidies provided and support provided to residents, in many ways surpasses similar offers in comparable megalopolises.  Now Moscow ranks third in the world in the number of technology start-ups, second only to New York (6.3-7.8 thousand) and London (4.3-5.9 thousand).  Moscow today is at the level of Seoul (1.5‚Äì3.4 thousand), ahead of Sao Paulo, Paris, Berlin, Singapore. </li><li>  University support. </li><li>  More tolerant attitude to the possible loss of funds of investment funds, which receive funding from the state and invest in risky projects. </li><li>  Creating an urban media cluster to support media content exporters.  Attraction of international companies to the production of content, as it is done in the media hub of Seoul, which for 20 years has increased the export of South Korean films by 250 times in terms of value. </li></ol><br>  According <a href="https://ria.ru/economy/20180724/1525180760.html">to a BCG survey</a> , Moscow is in the top 10 desired places for relocation and the work of foreign qualified specialists, ahead of Tokyo and Singapore, and about 40% of qualified specialists are ready to consider Moscow as a city for living and working.

      Managing Director, Chairman of BCG Russia Vladislav Butenko says that economic competition between countries today ‚Äúgrows into competition between megalopolises for human resources, investment and the presence of technology companies, with the most successful megacities relying on talent as a key advantage in the competitive struggle in the new economy ". <br><br>  ‚ÄúMoscow will join the group of megacities leading in competitiveness in the new economy by 2025, provided the pace of change is maintained,‚Äù experts at <i>The Boston Consulting Group</i> are convinced. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/418015/">https://habr.com/ru/post/418015/</a></p>
