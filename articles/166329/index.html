Quantitative criterion</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  I periodically have a natural desire to find out which software is more convenient, or to prove the advantage of a product with the help of some adequate, numerical arguments (and not as usual). <br><br>  Having become interested in this topic seriously, I have been looking for solutions for a long time, and even a year ago I wrote and defended my thesis ‚ÄúDetermining a quantitative assessment of the quality of human-computer interaction‚Äù.  I will tell about it in the article. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  There are several ways to determine the convenience of the interface. <br><br><h4>  Working techniques </h4><br><h6>  User questionnaire </h6><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/cec/a23/034/ceca230342cf06a3862ad5a0b1834aba.jpg"><br>  There are many internationally approved questionnaires (SUMI, SUS, SEQ, etc.), which are lists of 1 to infinity with questions like "Did you find this system difficult for yourself."  In the text of the thesis, you can see an overview of several of the most popular systems.

    <h6>  Experiments on live users </h6><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/6ac/5ff/6cd/6ac5ff6cda8ea5894fba3f1d1ea435bd.jpg"><br>  You can conduct a series of experiments with some numerical parameters (for example, the speed of the task, the number of errors or the average level of the tasks). <br><br><h6>  Expert </h6><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/5d9/ce1/995/5d9ce19959c66651befaa211df298385.jpg"><br>  You can invite some reputable uncle and hope that during his 5/10/20-year experience he has learned something like that. <br><br>  But these methods require you to hire an expensive usability specialist (or even a few), and catch users on the street. <br>  Therefore, many developers, horrified by the prospect of interacting with end users, have come up with ways to formally assess the complexity of the system. <br><br><h4>  Techniques that do not require the participation of a specialist or users </h4><br>  * if it is interesting to learn more about any methodology, a review with references to the literature is in the text of the diploma <br><br><h6>  Determination of the average time required by the user according to the method of GOMS, KLM </h6><br>  On the basis of average values, it is simply considered how much time the average user would spend on performing basic tasks.  True, it is not clear who determines which user scenarios to calculate. <br><br><h6>  Entropy RGB-profile </h6><br>  The visual complexity of the system is evaluated.  Obviously, the program with ten panels and twenty buttons is more complicated than the Google start page.  Naturally, the method is very relative, but simple and fast. <br><br><h6>  Productivity Information </h6><br>  The ratio of the minimum amount of information needed to complete a task to the amount of information that the user must enter.  For example, if an informational modal window is displayed with a single ‚ÄúOK‚Äù button, then the information entered by the user (click on the button) is absolutely useless, which reduces the information performance indicator. <br>  It is not very clear how to determine whether information is needed or not for more and more complex cases.  Most likely, without an expert, too, can not do. <br><br><h6>  XML Tree Analysis </h6><br>  The more complex the code describing the interface, the more likely the program‚Äôs more difficult for the user. <br>  A very controversial statement, most likely works only for a very rough estimate (photoshop is more complicated than a notepad, since the code is larger). <br><br><h6>  Number of classes into which interface objects can be broken. </h6><br>  At this last, so clumsily named method, I stopped. <br>  Before describing the essence of the method, I will immediately make a reservation that its scope is rather limited.  When I just found out about him, he beamed with a fabulous light, but in the process of working on his diploma, he somehow leaned around a bit and was blown away.  Most likely, such a method can be used for small widget applications, in which you can more or less distinguish the main tasks and constant sequences of actions.  It is not suitable for creative applications with supercontrol and non-formalizable result (photoshop, autocad, etc.) <br><br>  I was based on the methodology for assessing the complexity of the Tim Comber and John Maltby systems, as outlined in Comber T., Maltby JR Investigating Layout Complexity;  in Proc.  CADUI 1996 <br><br>  We denote the complexity of the system C. In accordance with the theory of informational entropy of Claude Shannon, modified by Ji Bonsipe, the complexity will be determined by the formula <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/bbf/582/c6e/bbf582c6ed0670b36faed0c7930fc8ec.png"><br><br>  where N is the number of all objects, <br>  p <sub>i</sub> - relations of objects in the i-th class to all objects (pi = ni / n), <br>  n is the number of object classes, <br>  n <sub>i</sub> - the number of objects of the i-th class, <br><br>  For use in video display terminals, let's assign complexity to the location and size of objects: <br>  C = C <sub>S</sub> + C <sub>D</sub> , <br>  where C <sub>S is</sub> based on classes-sizes of objects and C <sub>D</sub> on classes-mutual arrangement. <br><br>  The complexity of an individual object: <br>  C <sub>O</sub> = C / N <br><br>  Of course, this is a primitive way.  But this is a way that somehow tries to distribute objects by type.  If the buttons are the same size and are there, then everything is simple.  If all controls are different, then the functions they perform are also likely to be diverse and specific. <br><br>  The original algorithm involves the evaluation of only one, the main screen of the application.  I will evaluate the complexity of the entire sequence of screens that a user must go through in order to complete his task.  For each screen, an indicator of complexity is calculated, and if, while performing a task, some elements of the interface remain constant, a reduction factor is entered for them. <br><br>  To make the assessment more tied to life, I suggested introducing coefficients of user and task significance. <br>  Users are divided into several groups depending on their needs and tasks to be performed; a significance factor is set for each type of user. <br>  It depends on: <br>  - the number of users of this type, <br>  - the frequency of their use of the product, <br>  - the value of their time or marketing significance of this type. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/983/041/0a9/9830410a93e44ed97802fba9d0fc37f0.png"><br>  C <sub>uk</sub> - system complexity for the k-th type of users <br>  C <sub>tn</sub> - the complexity of the n-th problem <br>  K <sub>tn</sub> - coefficient of importance of the nth task for the user <br><br>  After we get information about how difficult it is to use the interface for each group of users, we can calculate the final complexity.  To do this, we need to sum up the difficulties for user types multiplied by user weighting factors. <br><br>  The main difference between this approach and the original method is that we rely on real people with real needs.  A program cannot be abstractly complex, it can be difficult for people whose tasks it does not perform or performs for a long time, and overloading it with unnecessary information.  In essence, the concept of complexity is redefined to fit the tasks. <br><br><h5>  In short </h5><br>  So, I took a technique that determined the complexity of the interface, measuring how many classes all controls can be broken into and how many controls each class has. <br>  I suggested first to allocate several types of users, to each, depending on the number, frequency of use and cost of time, assign a coefficient. <br>  For each type of user, highlight tasks with different significance coefficients. <br>  For each task, create a sequence of screens and read them according to the original method. <br>  In the end, a score is obtained reflecting how simple the interface is for performing specific tasks by relevant users. <br><br>  The weak point: you still need to allocate users and tasks yourself.  But once you figure out which types of users and what tasks they have, you can quickly and cheaply assume how much better or worse alternative versions are.  It works only for fairly simple programs. <br><br>  Usefulness: it turns out not a vague expert comment, but numbers that can be compared. <br><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">References (abbreviated, without nonsense)</b> <div class="spoiler_text"><ol><li>  Danilyak V.I.
