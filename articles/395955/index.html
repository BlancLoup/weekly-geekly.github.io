  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Israeli company General Robotics presented a mini-drone equipped with short-barreled weapons</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  At the last Eurosatory 2016 international exhibition in Paris last month, the Israeli company General Robotics presented its new development - the DOGO tactical combat robot.  This is the world's first miniature combat tactical robot with short-barreled weapons "on board." <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/a33/5f7/df7/a335f7df7ca162a5a0f54565209b0505.png" alt="image"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  News about the creation and conduct of pilot tests of the next combat robot are published almost daily.  At the same time, the overwhelming majority of them are large-sized combat vehicles weighing hundreds of kilograms, completed with heavy weapons systems: machine guns, grenade launchers, or even missile systems. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/c67/303/ae9/c67303ae9a55d219106c0c8292598a89.jpg" alt="image"><br><cut text=""><br>  With all the effectiveness of the use of such systems in open areas, their use in anti-terrorist and police operations in confined spaces ‚Äî for example, inside buildings, in tunnels or bunkers is either extremely limited or impossible.

Successful start and obvious practical impact strengthened the company's management in the correctness of the chosen direction and became a serious incentive for its further development. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/88d/f48/c79/88df48c79e9e94ad898289067e7ee10c.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  General Robotics DOGO 12-kilogram radio-controlled tracked tactical combat robot is equipped with a remote control with a touch screen and an easily customizable intuitive user interface, which is extremely important in real combat. <br><br>  According to Shahar Gal, vice president of enterprise development and the son of the company's founder, colonel of the IDF, retired, Udi Gala, ‚Äúwe would like to do more than just‚Äú eyes and ears ‚Äùat risk, that is, create a means to influence and neutralize the source of the threat. " <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/6e0/922/950/6e092295070a4da18928d9ad11aa6a91.jpg"><br><br>  DOGO was named after the Argentinean mastiff - powerful, strong and merciless dogs, bred for hunting wild boar and puma.  The seriousness of intentions DOGO is ready to confirm the means of fire destruction of the enemy.  In the basic configuration, a Glock-26 9 x 19 mm pistol is built on board the robot, placed on a rotating gun carriage and capable of releasing 14 cartridges at the enemy.  Israeli engineers have also foreseen the possibility of upgrading non-lethal weapons systems, shooting gas and light ammunition, and, if necessary, with a minimal modification of the design, with other systems of lethal short-barreled weapons.  The weapon is located inside the drone in a special folding compartment. <br><br>  DOGO robot is equipped with 8 digital day and night micro-video cameras, which guarantee the operator a comfortable all-round view.  Two of them are designed directly for guidance and shooting.  The built-in laser target designator facilitates and improves pointing efficiency. <br><br>  Dogo is able to climb stairs, overcome difficult terrain and, most importantly, perform the task set much more efficiently and accurately than a human being. <br><br>  The development of a multifunctional DOGO turned out to be a non-trivial technical task, since it was necessary to ensure low weight and compactness of the design and at the same time keep the robot able to climb up the stairs without any preparation.  Serious work has been done in the process of creating a control system, an effective and sufficiently safe weapon activation system.  A number of innovative technical problems had to be solved at the development stage of a fire system capable of providing high accuracy of fire, while demonstrating resistance to recoil from a shot. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/7f8/800/af9/7f8800af9cb4bb7ea8b8d6421192282e.jpg" alt="image"><br>  <i><sub>Tactical combat robot General Robotics DOGO in action</sub></i> <br><br>  Armament and guidance system of the robot creates unique opportunities for confident defeat of the enemy without the need to put at risk the life of the operator.  DOGO demonstrates excellent maneuverability and is capable of speeds up to 6 km / h, overcoming climbs up to 45 ¬∞.  The lithium batteries are used as a power source, ensuring a continuous operation time from 2 to 5 hours. <br><br>  Until the official announcement at the exhibition, the company has already demonstrated the prototype of a robot several times in private presentations, both in Israel and abroad.  Now DOGO is ready for serial production.  As representatives of the company noted, in the course of the countless tests that preceded the launch into mass production thousands of shots were fired and a variety of scenarios of combat, reconnaissance and anti-terrorist missions were simulated. <br><br>  The motto of General Robotics: ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs better to lose DOGO than a fighter!‚Äù Is not just an advertising slogan.  Personal motives have played a significant role in the creation of the robot.  Cyn Udi Gala, IDF Marine Special Forces, was wounded in the arm during one of the assault operations, and another bullet was stuck in the helmet.  Now that the DOGO combat robot will be at the disposal of the fighters, it is possible that such scenarios can be avoided in most cases. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/5_fc8cQASxE%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700023,15700186,15700191,15700248,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhi-jPvp7_NCmSIIEW5pSiKStm3d2Q" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br><hr><br>  That's all with you was Dronk.Ru.
