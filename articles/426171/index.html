We are almost close to the anniversary, and on the threshold of it we would like to reflect on what makes a business successful, as a large company grows from a small company.  We asked the heads and employees of the LANIT group about this and, based on their answers, we formulated the components of a successful business.  We want to introduce you to the results of our survey and discuss them. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/38d/2ed/d4f/38d2edd4f1757ce663e89dcf53224135.jpg"></div><br>  What helps to build a sustainable business?  What programs it for continuous growth and development?  What unites the team and motivates it?  We discussed this topic a lot within the company with its top managers and employees.  Here are the main conclusions to which we have come. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h2>  1. Team leaders </h2><br>  It is necessary to support the leadership and employees propensity for leadership.  Quickly make a career people who are able to take responsibility and achieve their goals. <br><br><h2>  2. The desire to be first </h2><br>  To be a leader, it is necessary to grow very actively, and grow faster than the market, consistently strengthening its position.

    <blockquote>  ‚ÄúWe have an idea to always be leaders, even though this is not always possible, but we constantly strive for this.  Fortunately, unlike sports, we have no age limit: if you have not become the best gymnast before the age of 20, then you will never be farther.  We [in the IT business] can constantly strive for this and at some point become the best.  Therefore, our desire to be leaders is interesting for people.  It's nice to work when you are a leader, not when you are in a ‚Äújust to survive‚Äù situation. <br><br>  <i>George Gens, founder of the LANIT group of companies</i> </blockquote><br><h2>  3. Continuous search for new features </h2><br>  Readiness for advance of time is the only way to maintain a leading position in the market.  You need to be a conductor of new, track trends, invest in R &amp; D, find new partners. <br><br><blockquote>  ‚ÄúWe understand how important it is to quickly adapt to new realities.  Our priorities are our own development, the transformation of accumulated knowledge and competencies into new services, the search for new markets and the expansion of geography. ‚Äù <br><br>  <i>Philip Gens, President of the group of companies LANIT</i> </blockquote><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/8d1/cf8/278/8d1cf8278e26df30da93fff153864184.jpg"></div>  <i>Mediacomplex ‚ÄúTime Machine‚Äù, Zaryadye Park</i> <br><br><h2>  4. The choice of optimal solutions and actions </h2><br>  It is important to be able to look critically at any question, not to take on faith the correctness of the fact that ‚Äúeveryone is doing this, therefore we need it,‚Äù not to splurge and not be standardized. <br><br><h2>  5. Products and services of the highest quality. </h2><br>  ‚ÄúTo be the partner of the best, to be the best of the partners‚Äù - this should be the motto of the company that wants to be successful. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/7b6/4c2/721/7b64c27218e2751cec0677482dcf8b76.jpg"></div>  <i>MegaTsOD-2 of Sberbank in Skolkovo</i> <br><br><h2>  6. Orientation to the real needs of customers </h2><br>  You need to understand the client, not your immediate interests, to be able to hear his voice, not your own. <br><br><h2>  7. Responsibility and guaranteed fulfillment of its obligations </h2><br>  This is the foundation of successful work in the long term. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/36a/0ef/9ea/36a0ef9ea0ea0d915bc8c6e624f03454.jpg"></div>  <i>The work of the Uptime Institute commission in the Technical Support Center of the Technopark ‚ÄúZhigulevskaya Valley‚Äù</i> <br><br><h2>  8. Self-criticism </h2><br>  No need to bronze, calm down, reaching a certain goal, even if it is very high.  The ability to look critically at things is a must. <br><br><h2>  9. Wednesday </h2><br>  I want to keep the bar when those who have already achieved professional success are working nearby. <br><br><h2>  10. Professionalism </h2><br>  It is important to consistently increase the level of competence.  Employees should constantly exchange information, ideas, solutions.  The idea of ‚Äã‚Äãcomplexity helps to raise professionals with a broad outlook, freely guided in everything that happens in the company. <br><br><blockquote>  ‚ÄúSuccess is determined by ... people who have the courage to take on very complex projects, projects that have no analogues not only in our practice, but sometimes in general anywhere in the world.  Moreover, this courage is not a reckless underestimation of risk.  It is based on self-confidence, repeatedly confirmed by experience.  Carrying out such projects, our employees acquire expert knowledge, sometimes unique. ‚Äù <br><br>  <i>Murat Marshankulov, managing director of LANIT-Integration</i> </blockquote><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/382/1e2/7ff/3821e27ff9bb3262401a740b7afae174.jpg"></div>  <i>Equipment of the Luzhniki Grand Sports Arena</i> <br><br><h2>  11. Efficiency </h2><br>  Inefficient staffing is unacceptable.  It is dangerous, as an infection, seeking to take an epidemic character. <br><br><h2>  12. Freedom to make decisions </h2><br>  Freedom of decision making and choice makes room for creativity.  Freedom and democratic environment, compensated by a great deal of personal responsibility, make it possible to feel the significance of each person‚Äôs personal contribution to overall success. <br><br><blockquote>  ‚ÄúThere is a lot of operational freedom, freedom to make decisions.  At the same time, of course, no one has canceled responsibility for the financial result. ‚Äù <br><br>  <i>Yury Bagirov, Head of the Directorate</i> </blockquote><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/d53/9ba/372/d539ba3728f87d70d8d9534b4ef3a0ad.jpg"></div>  <i>Photos taken under water on the iPhone.</i>  <i>Exhibition "Immersion" Inventive Retail Group</i> <br><br><h2>  13. Self-motivation and self-organization </h2><br>  Everyone understands their area of ‚Äã‚Äãresponsibility, and he finds the best solution. <br><br><h2>  14. Entrepreneurial spirit, initiative </h2><br>  It is necessary to search purposefully among employees of people with entrepreneurial spirit and promising business ideas, to support initiative. <br><br><h2>  15. Trust </h2><br>  The more you trust people, the less likelihood of trouble.  Very important and such human qualities as honesty, integrity, goodwill. <br><br><blockquote>  "The main secret of success is to trust people who want to do something, giving a chance to those who want to take responsibility for the result." <br><br>  <i>Andrey Vladimirov, General Director, LAN ATM Service</i> </blockquote><br><h2>  16. The right to make mistakes </h2><br>  Errors are a normal working practice.  But if instead of a plan to correct mistakes, you offer excuses, your project is doomed.  You should always have a high risk management plan. <br><br><h2>  17. Reasonable decentralization </h2><br>  Developing a direction according to one‚Äôs vision and experience, a manager who enjoys a high degree of trust of the first person may make local mistakes, but the company / business as a whole will not suffer. <br><br><blockquote>  ‚ÄúThe history of LANIT is unique to the market: having increased the scale of business many times, we have retained the original growth pattern.  Usually, the business is built from top to bottom, but here it is different.  When LANIT grew in new business directions, department heads took responsibility for their development.  This is how our leading companies and their top managers grew.  In addition, LANIT did not touch the ‚Äúreformatting‚Äù that many giants of the market went through - when they hire a well-known CEO and he redraws the company's structure into a standard - vertical one. ‚Äù <br><br>  <i>Philip Gens</i> </blockquote><br><h2>  18. Minimum formalization in all processes. </h2><br>  The lack of bureaucracy allows you to find interesting and effective solutions that in a formalized corporate environment simply could not be born and survive.  It is important not to beat on the hands, not to entangle instructions.  Then wings grow. <br><br><h2>  19. Openness of information </h2><br>  Telling the truth to yourself, the employees, the customer is most advantageous.  No need to hide problems.  It is necessary, based on the facts, to seek solutions. <br><br><h2>  20. The importance of human relationships </h2><br>  Openness, willingness to share knowledge and experience should be in the traditions of the company. <br><br><blockquote>  "The human nature of the relationship gives rise to an informal attitude to work." <br><br>  <i>Alexey Sosonkin, Head of Department</i> </blockquote><br><h2>  21. Mutual respect </h2><br>  Respect for each other, for customers and partners, expressed in accuracy, correctness, reliability and commitment even in small things should be the norm of life. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/9ef/07e/45f/9ef07e45f102501c3a47bf717d73d92e.jpg"></div>  <i>Vostochny cosmodrome, project team</i> <br><br><h2>  22. Belief in the unlimited possibilities of people. </h2><br>  A priori, all people are good, talented and can do almost everything. <br><br><h2>  23. Sense of humor </h2><br>  With him you can not just survive in the most hopeless situation, but also to succeed. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/b13/b22/7e5/b13b227e524bb351c62bc2d370cebcae.jpg"></div>  <i>Modernization of the meteorological network of Roshydromet, Kotelny Island</i> <br><br><h2>  24. Pleasure from work </h2><br>  It is important to enjoy the fact that you create useful products, carry out the necessary projects. <br><br><hr><br>  On October 16, 1989 the ‚ÄúLaboratory of New Information Technologies‚Äù (LANIT) was founded.  It began with its founder, George Gens, and just a few employees.  At first LANIT was engaged in distribution.  At the same time, the company's specialists learned how to install equipment, test and configure it, provide service support, refine software, and train users.  Developed the direction of system integration and the development of its own software. <br><br>  Almost 30 years have passed, and the small company has become a corporation, which occupies the first positions in the industry ratings. <br><br><blockquote>  IDC group of companies LANIT ranks 1st in terms of revenue among companies providing IT services in Russia, with a share of 9.6% of the market, in the annual competition Competitive Profiles and Analysis of Leading IT Services Players in Russia, 2018. </blockquote><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Other achievements</b> <div class="spoiler_text">  <b>Also in the study "Competitive Profiles and Analysis of Leading IT Services Players in Russia, 2018":</b> <br><br>  <i>By type of service</i> <br><br><ul><li> 1st place in network integration and consulting; </li><li>  1st place in IT consulting; </li><li>  1st place in custom software development; </li><li>  1st place in the installation and maintenance of equipment; </li><li>  1st place in application management outsourcing; </li><li>  2nd place in system integration; </li><li>  2nd place in outsourcing computer and network equipment; </li><li>  3rd place in IT education and training; </li><li>  3rd place in software consulting and customization. </li></ul><br>  <i>Vertical markets</i> <br><br><ul><li>  1st place in IT services for the financial sector; </li><li>  1st place in IT services for government agencies; </li><li>  1st place in IT services for the manufacturing sector; </li><li>  1st place in IT services for energy. </li><li>  2nd place in IT services in the sector of telecommunications and media. </li></ul><br>  <b>In other industry ratings</b> <br><br><ul><li>  1st place in the ranking of the largest consulting groups in Russia (RAEX); </li><li>  2nd place in the ranking of the largest Russian groups and companies in the field of information and communication technologies (RAEX). </li></ul><br>  <b>In ratings of the largest Russian companies</b> <br><br>  ‚Äú200 largest private companies in Russia‚Äù (Forbes, 74th place). <br><br>  <b>In HR market research</b> <br><br>  8th place in HeadHunter's ‚ÄúRanking of Employers in Russia 2017‚Äù by HeadHunter. </div></div><br>  The principles listed in the article helped the company LANIT grow big.
