In our company, <b>this stage of work now takes about 30% of the time</b> from all the events held as part of website promotion.

      I want to share some of the key points that will increase visitor loyalty, search engine authority and save on useless advertising. <a name="habracut"></a><br><br><h5>  Indicator ... what? </h5><br><img align="left" src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/4b178c0a/c69eb59d/69d83059/4e08b664.jpg">  Recently, I have often heard some performers say to customers with a smart look: ‚ÄúRefusals on the site!  You have them very big! ‚Äù, Referring to the percentage of people who immediately leave the site, looking only at one page. <br><br>  In general, this indicator can be used for something.  But in fact, <b>failures are a more specific value associated with an action</b> .  For example, a visitor came to the site, but did not fill out the feedback form or put the goods in the basket, but did not pay for it. <br><br>  Only on the basis of the analysis of such failure rates can specific recommendations be given.  And what can you advise based on the number of single views?  Something like "improve your site." <br><br>  In addition, the visitor could come to the page with a description of the goods, see the price and its description, and leave.  He has achieved his goal, which means that this cannot be considered a failure. <br><br><h5>  Visitors vs search robots </h5><br><img align="left" src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/b35cedf1/f80fc02b/84c8cfec/56632902.jpg">  And now we will connect all this with two factors: the loyalty of visitors and the success of search engine optimization. <br><br>  The first increases conversion, the second - taking into account user behavior in improving the visibility of the site in the results of search engines. <br><br>  The metric takes into account a lot of indicators, such as a map of clicks and time spent on the page.  Conventionally: if a visitor came and looked at one page on the site, but at the same time used scrolling or clicked on some elements, this is not a failure. <br><br>  From the point of view of the visitor, this is leaving the site when he has not found the necessary information, i.e.  "Not there got." <br><br>  Taking into account the recent months and a noticeable decrease in the influence of external links on the success of the promotion, the following picture emerges: you really need to make a quality website and ensure that the <b>page the visitor came to answered the question to the maximum</b> . <br><br><h5>  We improve, reducing failures </h5><br>  So, what can we analyze: <br>  1. Failures for specific pages <br>  2. Refusals by source of visitors <br>  3. Refusals for search phrases <br><br>  If they often leave the page, perhaps something is wrong with it.  It is likely that a person came to a completely left page, which should not have been included in the search index.  For example, a document with empty search results or a login form to the admin area. <br><br>  These pages need to be closed from indexing in robots.txt.  For you, this is not only a reduction in the overall failure rate for the site, but also in a sense - security from ‚Äúschool hackers‚Äù who, for fun, are looking for sites on old and not updated engines for a long time. <br><br>  In addition, the presence of useless documents in the index worsens the overall relevance of the site, which also reduces its visibility in search results. <br><br>  So, carefully stick into the document, and if we don‚Äôt find anything strange and terrifying, then we‚Äôll see where people come from on this page. <br><br>  We analyze failures for each source (for search engines ‚Äî specific phrases), as well as advertising materials used on them (for search engines ‚Äî signatures to the site in issue) and draw conclusions: which source of visitors is effective and which is not.  What advertising materials are made correctly and which are not. <br><br>  By search phrases.  We look at non-target phrases (that is, clearly not on your subject), and which pages on them come.  If possible, get rid of the mention of these phrases on the pages.  By target phrases we determine, and does a visitor come to that page?  If not, we optimize what we need, if so, we determine how obviously this document answers the question of a person. <br><br>  <b>As a result, we get rid of stupid advertising and ineffective advertising materials, as well as search phrases.</b>  <b>We save.</b>  <b>Increase conversion.</b> <br><br>  I am sure this article will help many different people to look at the scope of website promotion.  Do not consider everyone who works in it to be spammers or ‚Äúexperts‚Äù who sculpt documents that only robots can look at. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/120548/">https://habr.com/ru/post/120548/</a></p>
