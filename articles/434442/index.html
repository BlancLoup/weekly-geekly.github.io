Curiosity has another problem - back in 2016, the drill broke.  The scientific team decided to use the engines of the rover manipulator for drilling and in the summer of 2018 Curiosity <a href="https://ria.ru/20180605/1522070146.html">conducted the</a> first drilling operations in two years. <br><br>  The European <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%259C%25D0%25B0%25D1%2580%25D1%2581-%25D1%258D%25D0%25BA%25D1%2581%25D0%25BF%25D1%2580%25D0%25B5%25D1%2581%25D1%2581">Mars Express</a> has been working in Mars orbit for 15 years.  In October 2018, Mars Express <a href="https://universemagazine.com/7272/">watched</a> the train over the super volcano of Mount Arcia.  The train was similar to a volcanic eruption and stretched for 1500 km. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/v6/hl/bd/v6hlbd0x-ugwtx-6lzdncg2vogu.jpeg"><br><br>  And in December, a photograph of a frozen lake was published in the Korolev crater.  The crater is 82 kilometers long in winter and is filled with ice up to 1.8 km thick. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/qd/vk/7w/qdvk7wxnx2a3bxifljotgpix8yi.jpeg"><br><br><h4>  ExoMars: TGO </h4><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/l2/qt/gh/l2qtghl9v_flkfiwv2wdivyphk4.jpeg"><br><br>  Since 2016, the <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%25A2%25D1%2580%25D0%25B5%25D0%25B9%25D1%2581_%25D0%2593%25D0%25B0%25D1%2581_%25D0%259E%25D1%2580%25D0%25B1%25D0%25B8%25D1%2582%25D0%25B5%25D1%2580">TGO</a> (Trace Gas Orbiter) orbital module of the Russian-European mission ExoMars gradually braked the atmosphere of Mars and began research in the spring of 2018.

The launch took place on March 6, 2009.  During its operation, the telescope discovered 2.681 planets outside the solar system.  In April 2016, problems were discovered, and then the fuel ran out.  October 30, NASA <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/30_%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BA%25D1%2582%25D1%258F%25D0%25B1%25D1%2580%25D1%258F">announced</a> the completion of the mission. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/UBvMUOA5TXM" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><h4>  Tess </h4><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/dn/a6/ie/dna6ieqimwxhh6jlzhei2yowi4e.jpeg"><br><br>  The <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/TESS">TESS</a> (Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite) Planet Hunter telescope was <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3DTfZ2y3-2tc0">launched</a> on April 18, 2018 to replace Kepler and will conduct research to study open and detect previously unknown transit exoplanets around bright stars.  The data obtained by the TESS telescope will be used for further, more detailed studies by other telescopes in the future. <br><br><h4>  Chandrayaan 2 </h4><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/jo/g4/ez/jog4ezsfg3jjquoz-sncatqejhi.jpeg"><br><br>  The launch of the second Indian lunar mission, scheduled for March 2018, was postponed to January 30, 2019. The mission will consist of an orbital and landing craft and even a small lunar rover.  To achieve the lunar orbit, complex and lengthy maneuvers will be conducted.  The first Indian lunar rover will weigh only 20 kg.  and must work one lunar day. <br><br><h4>  Google Lunar Xprize </h4><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/as/6s/t4/as6st47pl7h7-casq_lwmtxdcdy.jpeg"><br><br>  The <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Lunar_X_PRIZE">Google Lunar Xprize contest</a> ended without a winner, but most teams plan to continue.  So the Israeli <a href="http://www.spaceil.com/">SpaceIL</a> will launch its lunar module (as an additional load) on the Falcon 9 already in February 2019. And the American team <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moon_Express">Moon Express</a> plans to hold two launches on the Electron rocket in 2019 at once. <br><br><h2>  Asteroids </h2><br><h4>  OSIRIS-REx </h4><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/zm/wo/05/zmwo05rjskrtoqv0sxeoidla824.gif"><br><br>  In December, the <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/OSIRIS-REx">OSIRIS-REx</a> interplanetary station arrived at the <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/(101955)_%25D0%2591%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BD%25D0%25BD%25D1%2583">Benn</a> asteroid.  After approaching, the device began to map the asteroid and measure the change in its orbit depending on the heating by the Sun.  The results of the mapping will be used to select the ground collection site, the collection will take place in 2019, and return to Earth in 2023. <br><br><h4>  Hayabusa-2 </h4><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/oe/ug/gd/oeuggdzm-zhfxvpuiiybwmgk6ba.jpeg"><br>  The Japanese Hayabusa-2 arrived in July at the asteroid (162173) <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/(162173)_%25D0%25A0%25D1%258E%25D0%25B3%25D1%2583">Ryugu</a> .
