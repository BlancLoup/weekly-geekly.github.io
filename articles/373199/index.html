      Selected by scientists to observe the planets are similar to the Earth, of course, only in size and that is very approximate.  Conditions such as energy sufficiency for the generation of life and minimal comfort for the development of the mind are performed much less frequently.  In general, in the Galaxy, only one of the parameters, the ‚Äúenergy sufficiency‚Äù, is suitable for approximately 6% of the Earth-like planets.  Atmospheric, volcanic and magnetic factors are much more difficult to assess.  Little data.  But, the more confirmed the number of such planets, the greater the chance of searching for aliens. <br><br>  Search is where.  Only in one Milky Way from 5 to 20 billion planets suitable for fantasies on the subject of a particular form of life.  Of course, they are far away and we still don‚Äôt see them, as we didn‚Äôt see any closer ‚Äúneighbors‚Äù until the end of the 1980s.  The first and closest to us habitable planet - Kepler-22 b in the constellation Cygnus - was seen in 2011.  Before her 650 light years. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Now we see our neighbors more and more often.  There are already a few thousand candidates for life-sustaining observations from satellites and calculated values, but this is unofficial.  Such data is usually confirmed by telescopes on Earth.  Confirmed "candidates" a little more than 3 and a half thousand.  And their number is constantly growing.  Index of viability of planets and their <a href="http://phl.upr.edu/projects/habitable-exoplanets-catalog">catalog here</a> . <br><br>  The peculiarity of yesterday's publication of data from NASA in the number of planets similar to the Earth within a single planetary system.  There are seven of them, of which six may be living conditions, and on three there may even be oceans of water.  The spectrum of this planetary system has been observed for several years.  It is quite well located for observation and quite close.  But we need a more powerful telescope.  With the current for a long time they were mistaken, for example, not only in the atmosphere, but also in the number of planets.  We waited three, saw seven.  The launch of the new ‚ÄúEuropean extremely large <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%2595%25D0%25B2%25D1%2580%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BF%25D0%25B5%25D0%25B9%25D1%2581%25D0%25BA%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B9_%25D1%2587%25D1%2580%25D0%25B5%25D0%25B7%25D0%25B2%25D1%258B%25D1%2587%25D0%25B0%25D0%25B9%25D0%25BD%25D0%25BE_%25D0%25B1%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BB%25D1%258C%25D1%2588%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B9_%25D1%2582%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BB%25D0%25B5%25D1%2581%25D0%25BA%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BF">telescope</a> ‚Äù is planned in 5 years in Chile.  The mirror will allow him to collect 15 times more light than any of the current analogues. <br><br>  The star around which these planets revolve is small.  About 1/16 from our Sun.  The planets themselves are not so different from the Earth in size.  It is just that such dull and cold stars have a habitat zone much closer than that of our Sun.  And such a star "small things" is full in the Universe.  This is a plus.  And a minus is that ‚Äúred dwarfs‚Äù, when they are born by radiation flashes, usually ruin the chances of life in their planetary system.  The TRAPPIST-1 system is young, the planets rotate quickly, turned one side toward the star, and astronomers themselves do not really believe in the existence of life there. <br><br>  But there it is beautiful, more precisely it is unusual ... <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/993/947/124/9939471248fa40128bc39063b8e4b1b8.jpg"></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/373199/">https://habr.com/ru/post/373199/</a></p>
