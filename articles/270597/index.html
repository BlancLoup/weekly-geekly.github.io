If in 2013 there was one Russian, then in 2014 there were already two (one with the report), and in 2015 there were four of us (and again one report).

      For the second year in a row, your humble servant visits and gives reports at KAZOOCon, and this year the Russian company I represented was even on the list of sponsors of the conference. <br><br><h4>  About 2600hz and KAZOO </h4><br>  KAZOO is a unique open source (MPL) product designed to organize cloud telephony services, in particular, virtual PBX services.  Earlier, I wrote a <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/234937/">review article about KAZOO</a> . <br><br>  For the year that has passed since the publication of the previous article, the KAZOO platform has greatly advanced, becoming even more stable and functional.  There are many new developers in the community, the number of deployments and serviced clients has increased. <br><br>  A pleasant moment was the recognition by the authors of the system of the fact that the top-3 in the list of independent developers (contributors) of the project is a company from Russia.  They even gave us a special prize, as key participants in the project. <br><br><h4>  Conference history </h4><br>  The KAZOOCon conference was first held in 2013.  Since then, it has become annual and takes place in a two-day format.  Two days of the conference are filled with reports, demonstrations and free communication, in which about 120 participants exchange their experience in operating the system, developing sales and promoting cloud services, and also have a good time during the traditional afterparty at a bar nearby. <br><br>  All three times the conference was held at the nightclub (!) Of Broadway studios, not far from San Francisco‚Äôs Chinatown.  The time of holding has become traditional - the end of the first week of October.  This year it was the 5th and 6th.  Both days of the conference are filled with reports and demonstrations, and at the end of the first day is held after-party, in fact representing a collective drinking of alcoholic beverages in a bar nearby. <br><br><h4>  Key news conference </h4><br><h5>  KAZOO v4 </h5><br>  The availability of KAZOO v4 was announced, which will be different from the current version of the updated platform: <br><ul><li>  Erlang 17 </li><li>  Updated CouchDB (instead of BigCouch) </li><li>  Freeswitch 1.6 </li><li>  CentOS7 or Debian as the base OS </li></ul><br><br><h5>  Queues </h5><br>  A new call queue module has been announced, which will replace the not officially released ACDC application.  The new module will be the main commercial solution 2600hz for the organization of call centers.  Fortunately, the core of this system will be part of the open source version. <br><br><h5>  Monster UI callflows </h5><br>  An emergency ‚Äúdeath‚Äù of the KAZOO UI user interface was announced, in connection with which the Callflows module for the new Monster-UI interface was released in open form, allowing you to manage arbitrary call processing scenarios. <br><br><h5>  New targets 2600hz </h5><br>  The company officially announced the stabilization of the platform, in connection with which new goals were announced - development of integration solutions, development of commercial products based on the platform (in the USA), active development of additional unique modules for the Hosted version. <br><br><h5>  Million Terminal Devices </h5><br>  From the stage, there was information that the officially recorded number of SIP devices serviced by the hosted site itself 2600hz and also the sites of its key partners exceeded one million.  This is a momentous moment, which means that the platform is on a really large scale and a direct confirmation of its maturity. <br><br><h5>  Interesting reports and announcements </h5><br>  Very interesting announcements were made in the presentation of the Canadian company Voxter, which is known for its participation in the KAZOO project.  In particular, the company announced the imminent opening of the emulation module of the AMI protocol (Asterisk Management Interface), and even demonstrated its work. <br><br>  The Russian company SIPLABS (which was presented by the author of this article), being the leading participant in the project, announced the RADIUS support module for KAZOO, as well as several other projects and developments. <br><br>  Very interesting were the reports on the conduct of the cloud telephony business, customer retention, improvement of the quality of services provided, and competition. <br><br>  In general, the conference turned out traditionally interesting and full. <br><br><h4>  Little photo </h4><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/776/47d/a49/77647da49f604226baf3d4ecbb5e994b.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/877/6c4/e42/8776c4e4232c49e1ae08f874e20fda03.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/114/028/005/114028005d7b4d97a9bf4051d4780178.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/d73/d9b/3f9/d73d9b3f96c34e779680fccb03613662.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/38f/495/cb1/38f495cb14324c9d8271c8596f2480d7.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/cba/c0c/965/cbac0c96545f4e89993d5b6d2a7d076f.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/81e/013/e4a/81e013e4a0ec4a79b6a322ca04ca88ec.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/5c8/921/165/5c89211659ab45e0b962b44f37e78bf5.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/93b/f43/c78/93bf43c78c194a828be1b09fb8b7dd57.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/9bf/06c/be3/9bf06cbe3922451b954a45e3697e1f44.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/07f/65b/9ab/07f65b9abf9b462b8cf5c1d70aa6dac3.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/0bd/dfd/02b/0bddfd02b2a64550b7b8cc4c0a593acb.jpg"><br><br><h4>  Video </h4><br>  By tradition, all entries from the KAZOOCon conference are <a href="http://www.youtube.com/playlist%3Flist%3DPLwhBNccjGCsaWhO4sIkUpO4OjctfASbN2">available on Youtube</a> . </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/270597/">https://habr.com/ru/post/270597/</a></p>
