Let's remember how JPoint went through, what interesting things happened there ... and we will start preparing for Joker. </p><br><p>  Under the cat a lot of pictures, and, accordingly, you will need a lot of traffic.  Last time, habrovchane asked to pinch everything in the JPG.  Now it is done, but still it turned out quite volume. </p><br><p><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/wj/_k/aw/wj_kawistgqchuoze1kzyxoakf0.jpeg"></p><a name="habracut"></a><br><h2 id="kak-vsyo-proshlo">  How did everything go </h2><br><p>  JPoint 2019 is currently the largest Java conference in Russia and our largest specialized conference in general.  This is a very important event in the history of the Russian community of Java-developers. </p><br><p>  Unfortunately, it was from the size that the main problem went: it became cramped at the conference.  On some reports, people did not fit into the halls, and for this we offer our deepest apologies.  Even in the additional hall with overhead and at the demo stage there were overbooks.  There is a feeling that this is the real size of the conference, which can fit into the World Trade Center <em>without additional tweaks</em> . </p><br><p>  How did it happen?  The place where the conference is held, we call short - "playground".  The site is chosen strongly in advance (at least one year) based on the planned load, and then, in case of large discrepancies with the plan, the decision can be adjusted.  Loading halls is a key thing, we are watching it closely.  Two weeks before the conference, people were not so much abundant, but even slightly less than planned - and nothing foreshadowed problems.  And suddenly, at the very last moment, people abruptly and massively began to pay for new tickets.  While we were closing sales, tickets were purchased by another 200 people over and above the plan.  It was obviously impossible to change something.  What to do next year is the question.  In Moscow, there are more sites, for example, Crocus.  But Crocus - it is very, <strong>very</strong> expensive, and not quite suitable for the halls and equipment.  There are low ceilings, unregulated lights, echoes in the halls and something to do with soundproofing.  There is Skolkovo, but this is not the case at all - all the halls are small, for 100-200 people.  There, too, low ceilings - so much so that the screen is not normally hang, and also equipment issues.  So yes, finding a good platform for the next JPoint will not be easy.  But don't worry, we'll think of something. </p><br><p>  The rest of the conference was a success.  Even the report ‚ÄúThe Game of God‚Äù, which is not about Java at all and therefore could cause an ambiguous reaction, turned out to be a great success.  Speakers are inspired too.  Some of them are discussing how to get a reusable visa to Russia (as you probably know, there are always some difficulties with visas to Russia).  Someone measures how many hours he has stood in the discussion area and is going to overtake his colleagues next time.  Interesting reviews from speakers that few Java conferences in the world can be compared in terms of organization and, choosing between them and JPoint, they will choose him.  It seems that the emphasis on quality has begun to give long-lasting positive effects. </p><br><h2 id="fotografii-i-videozapisi-dokladov">  Photos and video reports </h2><br><p>  If you participated in the conference (it doesn‚Äôt matter - live or in the online broadcast), then all the cleaned and cut videos will appear in you very soon.  But everyone else will have to wait at least six months, we plan to post entries closer to Joker 2019. </p><br><p>  The first photos are already in our <a href="https://vk.com/album-796_263734340">group on VKontakte</a> .  The rest of the photos will be in about ten days. </p><br><p>  Further in this post, events are described approximately in the order in which they occurred at the conference: the opening keynout, the reports closing the keynout, bofs, and so on. </p><br><h2 id="otkryvayuschiy-keynout-antona-keksa-the-world-needs-full-stack-craftsmen">  Anton Keks opening keynote ‚ÄúThe world needs full-stack craftsmen‚Äù </h2><br><p><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/75/uh/7j/75uh7juyj_qgbz3dpkkfpmyayh4.jpeg"></p><br><p>  This is a very unusual report, which states, among other things, that a project without at least one fullstack engineer is dead.  There was an interesting moment when Anton asked: who could single-handedly rewrite the entire project from scratch if the whole team moved the truck?  A forest of hands is rising.  The next question is whether you will have a better project than the current one.  Most likely, yes - at least there were also enough hands.  But then in the course of the report it turns out that simply writing code from scratch is not enough.  You need to communicate with the client directly, propose solutions, design a UI, and so on and so forth, a cloud of slides with lists.  Anton continues to throw and throw skills - as a result, the discussion does not end with the end of the report - a whole crowd gathered in the discussion area, continuing the discussion of the topic. </p><br><p><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/st/p-/36/stp-36xird8qicv5ssjb4tpm8nc.jpeg"></p><br><h2 id="doklady-pervogo-dnya">  First Day Reports </h2><br><p>  Obviously, we with the <a href="https://habr.com/ru/users/phillennium/" class="user_link">phillennium</a> and <a href="https://habr.com/ru/users/golodnyj/" class="user_link">golodnyj</a> most of the reports could not be seen, because most of the time was spent doing interviews, communicating with companies, speakers, and so on.  So, probably, a post with a review of reports would be better to write to someone else.  But you, dear reader, now only I have, so I will tell only about what I had time to see! </p><br><p><img width="300" align="left" src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/vh/rd/i9/vhrdi9minoabbrsb33l9ordcp2o.jpeg">  First of all, this is a very breakthrough report on <a href="https://jpoint.ru/talks/6nb9luhmk57yk9hmblzoc1/">‚ÄúCreate your own interpreter with a JIT in 1 hour‚Äù</a> by Charlie Gracie.  By the way, how many people with the post Garbage Collection Architect do you know?  I'm not sure that this post is even worth cutting as ‚ÄúGCA at IBM‚Äù.  Imagine you are Charlie, come to the meeting and introduce yourself: ‚ÄúI am GCA at IBM‚Äù.  And all around are: "He - who ???" In short.  As expected, Charlie did not tell how to build the world in 7 days without the use of frameworks, but brought his Eclipse OMR.  We write an interpreter, the interpreter becomes a compiler, in theory everything is simple, in practice - you need to understand a lot of nuances.  At a minimum, C ++ is everywhere and the code you need to go into.  Charlie kodit right on his MacBook, often with C ++ programming, this is a fatal error (because it takes a long time to search for bugs), but Charlie has everything going smoothly.  Oh yes, this report has no slides, and how to do live decoding on Habr is not clear. <br clear="all"></p><br><p><img width="300" align="left" src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/js/wo/9o/jswo9oom3t6xzx4zvlymq0zhpji.jpeg">  The second is a very worthy thing, <a href="https://jpoint.ru/talks/6tqzgwcm9atqfq4nkazsd9/">"The Tale of how we did the algorithm of channels in Kotlin Coroutines"</a> .  Here the slides are <a href="https://assets.ctfassets.net/oxjq45e8ilak/3tNNExRPdCUTs1119aKdRa/a79f0b8cf47625af70863e2d14a3840a/Nikita_Koval_Channels_in_Kotlin_Coroutines.pdf">already there</a> .  And you can say, Nikita is the king of slides, because everything is clear on the slides, and there is even something that was not spoken by the words live.  Once I wrote a comic article about why Kotlin is <a href="https://habr.com/ru/company/jugru/blog/431678/">bad</a> (judging by 321 extremely serious comments, no one guessed that this was a joke).  In fact, Kotlin is a fantastic thing that is created and deployed right before our eyes.  When the coroutines were created, there was no support for them in runtime - and there is still no support, Pressler refuses to even hint at a release date.  How does all this work in Kotlin, how can it work at all?  And here comes the wizard and shows the secrets of his greatest tricks.  Well, okay, with the clarification that they haven‚Äôt yet released what Nikita is talking about - it‚Äôs still excellent.  Of course, it would be necessary to criticize something, and this is the question: what conclusion can an ordinary developer draw from this report?  And although not a word about Kotlin in the report, for me this is a great story for broadening my horizons (Nikita says this in his introductory speech), but anyone who wants to find some skills for instant use can be deeply offended . <br clear="all"></p><br><p><img width="300" align="left" src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/tj/t_/sy/tjt_syux0np3yss6wmirunixpmm.jpeg">  Thirdly, this is <a href="https://jpoint.ru/talks/1emn9byzaklzozk6ec56dp">‚ÄúSpring Boot Us, and we are getting stronger: the unbearable ease of AOT compiling Spring applications‚Äù</a> from Nikita Lipsky ( <a href="https://habr.com/ru/users/pjbooms/" class="user_link">pjBooms</a> ).  This is a very popular topic now AOT-compilation, and even the example of Spring Boot, about which intuitively it seems that AOT should not work with it.  And in GraalVM it really does not work (Spring Fu does not count).  And in Excelsior JET it works, and this is another great witch.  As always, I see it more like a report to increase my outlook: you begin to understand better how Spring works, how Java works in general - why language and runtime developers choose such solutions, and not others.  You understand the problems of modern clouds, and so on.  Well, probably, if you have a purchased JET, this is also a purely working question, but I don‚Äôt have one. <br clear="all"></p><br><h3 id="vse-doklady-pervogo-dnya-so-ssylkami">  All reports of the first day (with links) </h3><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Hidden text</b> <div class="spoiler_text"><p><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/wd/6t/pt/wd6tptsx16sbwjhbxtfkrjp0zvk.jpeg"><br>  <a href="https://jpoint.ru/talks/2xelfl2d9mgyweeeq60wiw">Oleg Dokuka</a> , <a href="https://jpoint.ru/talks/35kmzgw4ds3gyt849hbaeo">Simon Ritter</a> , <a href="https://jpoint.ru/talks/6wxij7hz0buprldhj02uwg">Yegor Bugaenko @ yegor256</a> , <a href="https://jpoint.ru/talks/6nb9luhmk57yk9hmblzoc1">Charlie Gracie</a> . <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/ws/1c/up/ws1cupr3khrbdhvppd8l7bd38ky.jpeg"><br>  <a href="https://jpoint.ru/talks/4yidy6xcly4wuiiueegw2c">Kohsuke Kawaguchi</a> , <a href="https://jpoint.ru/talks/35hks9g6etavlgijj8nfvh">Dmitry Chuiko</a> , <a href="https://jpoint.ru/talks/2w2eubjglmank7bdaurtlk">Victor Rentea</a> , <a href="https://jpoint.ru/talks/57wq8ab5ytwmw7pdjvxcjd">Tomasz Nurkiewicz</a> . <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/3e/u2/ok/3eu2ok6ikjqieq0x-mafieugvh4.jpeg"><br>  <a href="https://jpoint.ru/talks/c5srr3uywos62ewokgii0">Sebastian Daschner</a> , <a href="https://jpoint.ru/talks/57wq8ab5ytwmw7pdjvxcjd">Allard Buijze</a> , <a href="https://jpoint.ru/talks/5gauo6aka50au7apearcds">Thomas Wuerthinger</a> , <a href="https://jpoint.ru/talks/6tqzgwcm9atqfq4nkazsd9">Nikita Koval @ndkoval</a> . <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/n5/st/pu/n5stpu1x4upnwiwtqikw6lgunzs.jpeg"><br>  <a href="https://jpoint.ru/talks/c5srr3uywos62ewokgii0">Sergey Egorov</a> , <a href="https://jpoint.ru/talks/3s5nqebrevpregacfijhra">Bernd R√ºcker</a> , <a href="https://jpoint.ru/talks/2r0qpl14l6way6guqz5ujq">Yuri Artamonov</a> , <a href="https://jpoint.ru/talks/2r0qpl14l6way6guqz5ujq">Nikita Lipsky</a> . <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/ey/nf/y4/eynfy4mpfnacmghp78dhtg11yho.jpeg"><br>  <a href="https://jpoint.ru/talks/6og2mqhxtbc8qbpw3gyqvo">Ren√© Gr√∂schke</a> , <a href="https://jpoint.ru/talks/3ezm0sz0u4piyqtzw5cipb">Alexander Nozdrin-Carpenter</a> , <a href="https://jpoint.ru/talks/3ezm0sz0u4piyqtzw5cipb">Chris Hegarty</a> , <a href="https://jpoint.ru/talks/b9ib3swihayyhnnpjghc2">Kirill Tolkachev and Evgeny Borisov</a> . </p></div></div><br><h2 id="demo-stage">  Demo stage </h2><br><p>  At the demo-stage you could listen to a variety of reports.  For example, here's Alexander Belokrylov <a href="https://habr.com/ru/users/alexbel/" class="user_link">alexbel</a> from BellSoft talks about Liberica: </p><br><p><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/ud/3x/vd/ud3xvd-l04yjwl4o_qyrctx92n0.jpeg"></p><br><h2 id="vorkshop-thomas-wuerthinger">  Workshop thomas wuerthinger </h2><br><p>  Thomas specially set aside time for us and conducted a workshop.  He wanted to work with a very small audience (this turns out to be more efficient), so we didn‚Äôt make big announcements: there was a great chance that after his report the whole room would rise and move to a workshop, which is much more than the planned 20 people.  As a result, everything turned out great. </p><br><p><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/07/7-/g7/077-g7s9-vvrctxtqasaae4cjwc.jpeg"></p><br><h2 id="bof">  BOF </h2><br><p>  BOF is now a traditional format at our conferences.  Something like a round table or discussion group in which everyone can take part.  This format historically goes back to the first informal <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birds_of_a_feather_(computing)">discussion groups of the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF)</a> .  There is no division into a speaker and a participant: everyone participates on a par.  Nevertheless, there is a moderator on every boss, directing the discussion, and at least a few recognized experts - all together they make up the core from which the discussion begins, and then how it goes. </p><br><h2 id="microservices-cloud-i-kuda-vse-eto-dvigaetsya-ru">  Microservices, cloud and where it all goes (RU) </h2><br><p>  <strong>Participants</strong> : Oleg Anastasiev, Dmitry Chuiko, Alexander Nozdrin-Carpenter, Vladimir Plizga <a href="https://habr.com/ru/users/toparvion/" class="user_link">Toparvion</a> , Maxim Gorelikov <a href="https://habr.com/ru/users/somemaxim/" class="user_link">somemaxim</a> ; <br>  <strong>Moderator</strong> : Kirill Tolkachev. </p><br><p><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/gt/ve/kb/gtvekbk_a8tati_mmkjf2xacu70.jpeg"></p><br><h2 id="reactive--todays-need-and-future-perspectives-en">  Reactive - today's need and future perspectives </h2><br><p>  <strong>Participants</strong> : Sergey Egorov <a href="https://habr.com/ru/users/bsideup/" class="user_link">bsideup</a> , Oleg Dokuka, Tomasz Nurkiewicz, Vadim Tsesko; <br>  <strong>Moderator</strong> : Anton Arkhipov. </p><br><p><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/i-/zr/1p/i-zr1pu6upkpxqzuliganjhcmyw.jpeg"></p><br><h2 id="rumble-in-the-java-jungle-oracle-jdk-your-own-openjdk-build-alternatives-en">  Rumble in the jungle (Oracle JDK, your own OpenJDK build, alternatives) (EN) </h2><br><p>  <strong>Participants</strong> : Alexander Belokrylov, Simon Ritter, Bruno Borges; <br>  <strong>Moderator</strong> : Volker Simonis. </p><br><p><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/gn/j0/q5/gnj0q5nuzpczfq0d84i4nbnajna.jpeg"></p><br><h2 id="why-does-java-run-slow-en">  Why does Java run slow?

So much warmth and positive! </p><br><p><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/se/xn/8c/sexn8ck-3pxgsvt_cdlqpwxp4ee.jpeg"></p><br><h2 id="vecherinka">  A party </h2><br><p>  At the end of the first day there was a big party that allowed a bit to cool melting brains.  Naturally, it is not possible to photograph the entire huge party of one and a half thousand people, so here is a motivational picture for you. </p><br><p><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/jl/0y/yx/jl0yyxb5tt8pynivwgkcrju2na0.jpeg"></p><br><h2 id="otkryvayuschiy-keynout-vtorogo-dnya-aleksandr-panchin-igra-v-boga-pereshla-li-nauka-granicu">  Opening keynout of the second day: Alexander Pankin, ‚ÄúThe Game of God.  Has science crossed the border? ‚Äù </h2><br><p>  This keyout is not about java at all.  He said this: considering the latest achievements of genetic engineering, will we continue to play God or is it time to outplay him? </p><br><p><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/cr/md/v0/crmdv0s8mv7ihluxohjmsr1c1qi.jpeg"></p><br><p>  Despite the fact that the report at times concerns rather creepy things, Alexander manages to smooth corners.  For example, where we are talking about "fluffy genocide."  There is a famous story that there are no natural predators in Australia that can fight rabbits.  And when the rabbits were delivered, they devoured everything there, there is no grass in this photo.  They actively reproduce and destroy natural ecosystems.  No one will give a chance to kill all these unfortunate animals, but there is a hypothetical example when special mutant rabbits can be bred, in which females will run out after a lot of crosses and they will disappear on their own.  In this case, no rabbit was hurt, everyone was engaged in an exceptionally pleasant breeding process. </p><br><p><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/xw/m8/ku/xwm8kuticeohcwt-xg8tpmmlv8w.jpeg"></p><br><h2 id="doklady-vtorogo-dnya">  Second day reports </h2><br><p><img width="300" align="left" src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/79/o9/de/79o9de1xmjrkei8a_hql6xyifgc.jpeg">  I'll tell you more about a couple of reports.  It was definitely worth going to the report of Oleg Shelayev, <a href="https://jpoint.ru/talks/7jjesm28gvuujmgbmrwjty/">"Supercompilation, partial evaluation, projections of Futamura and how GraalVM will save the world</a> . <a href="https://jpoint.ru/talks/7jjesm28gvuujmgbmrwjty/">"</a>  We actively discussed this topic last year in the <a href="https://t.me/graalvm_ru">@graalvm_ru</a> community in Telegram, and finally, Oleg came to us with a full report.  This is a topic with a keen taste of patriotism: starting to study the documentation for Truffle, you quickly come across the fact that the theory is built on the works of Russian scientists of the last century.  It is not clear how the developers of Graal get along with this - most likely, they do not know how to read Russian.  It's nice that nothing is forgotten, and the ideas of Novosibirsk academicians have finally acquired their engineering embodiment.  And there were pineapples!  <em>(a joke for those who attended)</em> <br clear="all"></p><br><p><img width="300" align="left" src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/jy/vh/yq/jyvhyqxm4wqzbanxppfadt-m1sc.jpeg">  It was definitely worth going to <a href="https://jpoint.ru/talks/4ltyzdxqzmpeofbgkld7ns/">‚ÄúAtomic refactoring in IntelliJ IDEA: bending IDE by yourself‚Äù by</a> Tagir Valeeva ( <a href="https://habr.com/ru/users/lany/" class="user_link">lany</a> ).  Firstly, because it is Tagir.  Secondly, because it is something very practical.  Many refactorings do equivalent transformations - but not all.  If your program is not very strange, then everything is fine, but sometimes it breaks.  Sometimes it breaks positively - for example, you can replace tail recursion with a cycle, while the semantics change - the program stops falling, but this is even for the better.  This and many other things were in the report of Tagir, and I would review it again when videotapes appear. <br clear="all"></p><br><p>  More detailed analyzes, probably, will need to be done in TOP-10 or some such traditional format for Habr, where you can write an entire wall of text. </p><br><h3 id="vse-doklady-vtorogo-dnya-so-ssylkami">  All reports of the second day (with links) </h3><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Hidden text</b> <div class="spoiler_text"><p><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/y2/1g/o6/y21go6bzq2zr50vnfqtgkri-iky.jpeg"><br>  <a href="https://jpoint.ru/talks/7hdkasbciqgyumltlyoe6z">Pasha Finkelstein @ asm0dey</a> , <a href="https://jpoint.ru/talks/7hdkasbciqgyumltlyoe6z">Andrey Pangin</a> , <a href="https://jpoint.ru/talks/7hdkasbciqgyumltlyoe6z">Sebastian Daschner</a> , <a href="https://jpoint.ru/talks/7gcedvddxsm9p6k4ywwny1">Simon Ritter</a> . <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/ii/zk/ai/iizkai0kmwm4pxdy0fs9ey9uzqa.jpeg"><br>  <a href="https://jpoint.ru/talks/6fhvshh187ayscc7ahpeju">Milen Dyankov</a> , <a href="https://jpoint.ru/talks/6fhvshh187ayscc7ahpeju">Nikolai Igotti</a> , <a href="https://jpoint.ru/talks/7fyw10golijzms1eghmntp">Ivan Ponomarev</a> , <a href="https://jpoint.ru/talks/7jjesm28gvuujmgbmrwjty">Oleg Shelayev</a> . <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/q_/vf/af/q_vfafh6khrqqmolbv97kpzej1m.jpeg"><br>  <a href="https://jpoint.ru/talks/7jjesm28gvuujmgbmrwjty">Micha≈Ç P≈Çachta</a> , <a href="https://jpoint.ru/talks/7jjesm28gvuujmgbmrwjty">Grigory Koshelev</a> , <a href="https://jpoint.ru/talks/7jjesm28gvuujmgbmrwjty">Marc Hoffmann and Eugene Mandrikov</a> , <a href="https://jpoint.ru/talks/7jjesm28gvuujmgbmrwjty">Tagir Valeev</a> . <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/zs/0l/so/zs0lsoe_ljl7law7bw9sbkwrxpw.jpeg"><br>  <a href="https://jpoint.ru/talks/7jjesm28gvuujmgbmrwjty">Vladimir Sitnikov @vladimirsitnikov</a> , <a href="https://jpoint.ru/talks/7jjesm28gvuujmgbmrwjty">Nikhil Nanivadekar</a> , <a href="https://jpoint.ru/talks/7jjesm28gvuujmgbmrwjty">Vladimir Plizga</a> , <a href="https://jpoint.ru/talks/79c6yjo0q4q4esyosgeyoo">Rafael Winterhalter</a> . <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/t3/tt/eo/t3tteoynzovrge4pdsrnrd0u5w8.jpeg"><br>  <a href="https://jpoint.ru/talks/79c6yjo0q4q4esyosgeyoo">Olga Makhasoeva</a> , <a href="https://jpoint.ru/talks/79c6yjo0q4q4esyosgeyoo">Dmitry Govorukhin</a> , <a href="https://jpoint.ru/talks/31lsatiyrmg0ykfjbdppmg">Andrzej Grzesik</a> , <a href="https://jpoint.ru/talks/2hsfk1cviekoje6pse6wfy">Anton Arkhipov</a> . </p></div></div><br><h3 id="zavershayuschiy-keynout-bruno-borges-making-sense-out-of-serverless-computing">  Closing keynote: Bruno Borges, "Making sense out of serverless computing" </h3><br><p>  It's unusual to see someone from Microsoft as a keynote at a Java conference, because for many years everyone got used to the fact that Microsoft is about .NET, C #, and so on.  By itself, Bruno had previously worked as the Developer Advocate in Oracle.  He started his Java development career in 2001, wrote applications on Swing, then on JSP and Servlets, Apache Struts ... And now he is Developer Advocate already at Microsoft.  In this case, even in Microsoft, he does not use Windows, uses a Mac.  We live in amazing time.  The clouds play a significant role in this, and this is the whole story of Bruno.  As written in one of the first slides, ‚ÄúServerless is a State of Mind,‚Äù and this state implies that we can more freely choose our technologies than ever before.  When Bruno started the report, he asked how many people use serverless and there were very few hands.  By the end of the report, many people who had never thought about using serverless technologies had a desire to try them - this is the special magic of keynote reports when they don‚Äôt even show you any shocking low-level hardcore, kilometers of code, but simply show a big picture of everything. - and for you it becomes dear to the future. </p><br><p><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/eq/ht/uk/eqhtukyuezfyefdzqlms31newyq.jpeg"></p><br><h1 id="vystavka">  Exhibition </h1><br><p>  The conference was held at the International Trade Center (ITC).  At the entrance to the site we were waited by a beautiful exhibition, which we diligently obsutroili and filled with activities all sorts of companies.  It is not possible to write about all the companies and activities, there are too many of them, therefore, as always, I‚Äôm throwing a few random photos. </p><br><p>  At the Leroy Merlin stand, I lingered for a second in order to understand what strange iron things it was, and I was immediately offered to scan the QR code.  Guess <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%25A0%25D0%25B8%25D0%25BA%25D1%2580%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BB%25D0%25BB%25D0%25B8%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B3">what was the link</a> . </p><br><p><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/gt/jb/cr/gtjbcryn4tz7kqxcyusynvia21w.jpeg"></p><br><p>  At the stand of Sportmaster and Raiffeisenbank they play table hockey: </p><br><p><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/fr/0a/fk/fr0afkftujvogxtfoxbgg5ajfaw.jpeg"></p><br><p>  This is how people discuss the details of solving problems at the stand of the Deutsche Bank TechCenter and win prizes from Mediascope: </p><br><p><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/r9/lx/qh/r9lxqhd9lopdwsxs_07nse4swh8.jpeg"></p><br><p>  And at the stands of Alfa-Bank and HeadHunter you can chill, chat with employees and consume a huge amount of coffee: </p><br><p><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/g1/q6/hh/g1q6hh8nea6ck9dxfnxigmtaefc.jpeg"></p><br><p>  And it was also possible to buy a small volume of Yegor Bugayenko at the small bookshop of the Peter publishing house  If, however, writing according to the precepts of this book does not work and coding is not your topic at all, then you can try yourself in Adjale: </p><br><p><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/vg/s1/rz/vgs1rzvlhpyrxueqvtp0p3vb3iy.jpeg"></p><br><p>  Anything gets better if you write it on Kotlin! </p><br><p><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/zd/hz/7m/zdhz7mwdzhada1a6q1ylfsmr5gg.jpeg"></p><br><h1 id="organizaciya-konferencii-i-komanda">  Conference organization and team </h1><br><p>  I would like to say a special thank you to all colleagues who participated in the organization of the conference and who are now reading this article. </p><br><p>  By the way, it was the first JPoint, which started 23derevo without Alexey Fyodorov, at that moment he was in Porto at the <a href="http://icpclive.com/">ICPC</a> finals, but flew in on the second day and could be seen in the speaker room. </p><br><p>  The speaker-room is generally a very interesting place, and there occur their interesting things, closed from the outside world.  For example, Oleg Shelayev managed to drive his report on the projection of Futamura several times in a row and correct slides (and one of these runs was with me). </p><br><p>  Lyosha is on the left and Oleg is on the right :) </p><br><p><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/b6/t_/2a/b6t_2ahbjzv8ibzvgw2skxz8tga.jpeg"></p><br><p>  Nobody notices photographers, but they are!  Thanks to them in this post so many pictures.  In truth, this is the only photograph of a photographer that I even have - it seems that they do not take pictures of themselves. </p><br><p><img width="350" src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/oa/xt/or/oaxtorzrfpgh6wc0dz5e-hcxd1i.jpeg"></p><br><p>  In addition, the operators of video recording and video broadcasting work quietly and imperceptibly.  We have a new system for monitoring video and equipment in general, thanks to Artem Nikonov, Maxim Zverev and the rest of the participants in this feat. </p><br><p><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/cz/6n/f4/cz6nf4tdawqbpkb-itvtsnyck-e.jpeg"></p><br><p>  In addition, software coordinators can be found at the site - thanks to them, everything works like a clock. </p><br><p><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/oc/6s/n7/oc6sn7xwse9xgjlbe52q5m2zesa.jpeg"></p><br><p>  Finally, the halls and everything that happens there is the care of a large number of people who can solve any problems that arise.  By the way, there are not many problems to say that there was a lot - once the microphone began to catch the sound from the next room, it was quickly repaired, and from serious it was all. </p><br><p><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/v4/tk/fk/v4tkfkeuyjpkolwt1cpljhorshc.jpeg"></p><br><p>  You can continue for a long time: to talk about our own Wi-Fi network (over which Maxim Zverev is conjuring), about the online broadcast (which the <a href="https://habr.com/ru/users/phillennium/" class="user_link">phillennium</a> and I usually lead, <a href="https://habr.com/ru/users/olegchir/" class="user_link">olegchir</a> ), about reports from the demo-stage ... But this post will never end. </p><br><h1 id="chto-dalshe-joker-2019">  What's next: Joker 2019 </h1><br><p>  Let's summarize.  JPoint 2019 is completed, it turned out to be very good, and further we are waiting for new conferences. </p><br><p>  We are opening sales <a href="https://jokerconf.com/%3Futm_source%3Dhabr%26utm_medium%3D447498">Joker</a> , which will be held this fall, October 25-26.
