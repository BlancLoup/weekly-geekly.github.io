  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Oh poyle for suckers and not only</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  The level of service in a restaurant once could be determined in a fairly simple way.  It was enough to go to a restaurant, look at the menu, make sure that there is no ‚Äúmilk‚Äù line with a price tag in front of it and order this plain drink.  The fact is that there is always milk in a restaurant, because  without it, it is impossible to cook many dishes, in particular - milkshakes.  A good restaurant in the face of smiling waiters will not be confused and will accept an order without talking.  A less good restaurant in the face of indifferent waiters will ask you to wait a ‚Äúsecond‚Äù and in a couple of minutes will tell you that ‚Äúof course you can order milk‚Äù.  A bad restaurant in the face of offended waiters in milk will refuse, complaining that it is not on the menu. <br><br>  And indeed, this method once worked well.  They were skillfully used by the guys who needed to evaluate the service in several dozen restaurants promptly and without much material damage.  This way I amused myself.  But something happened, and now wherever you go - they will bring milk.  Is always.  Everywhere.  Bring even in the most vile stash with a particularly disgusting service.  So I stopped playing this game because most likely everyone guessed it, and it became uninteresting.  I hope the guys who needed to evaluate the service in several dozen restaurants quickly and without much material damage also said goodbye to the dairy way. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a>  Yesterday in Jaztown I was given a large menu.  We ordered coffee, juice and expensive cakes.  I ate and asked for some chewing gum.  ‚ÄúWe don't have chewing gums.  Absolutely not".  I was a little surprised, because in many restaurants chewing gum is brought for free, along with the bill.  And here, along with the casino, they have a hefty complex, and in this whole multi-story labyrinth there is no gum for which people are ready to pay.

      I remember that in one of the Yaroslavl restaurants there were many visitors, and brandy suddenly ended.  The waiter ran a bullet for a bottle in a nearby grocery store.  As a result, the visitor was satisfied, and the restaurant received even insignificant, but still revenue.  What's more important - the restaurant has saved its reputation.  This is not difficult if you think about it. <br><br>  However, in Moscow, people do not want to work.  They don't have to be supermen, no.  Sometimes they just forget to turn on the brain, or even turn it off intentionally.  Other firms were spoiled, and small orders are either reluctantly taken or not taken at all.  You can often find such devil-may-care attitude that it becomes incomprehensible to the mind how people generally manage to earn some money.  But the money they earn goes to the same disgusting service of the same indifferent people.  And this is the basis of the economy of our country - here indifference and razdolbaystvo reigns. <br><br>  Many are upset that in Russia all the niches of the business have long been occupied.  These many even fail to realize that you can take almost any sphere, focus on quality and excel.  After all, almost every company in our country looks like a sieve when viewed in detail, from which, thanks to the holes and flaws, gigantic opportunities and prospects flow.  I do not understand economics and am not familiar with professional management.  I argue as a man who came to Moscow six months ago and has since everywhere been confronted with indifference.  Today it is even possible to compete with giants.  You just need to do your job properly.  Time will pass, and many will realize it.  And it will be harder to compete. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/37560/">https://habr.com/ru/post/37560/</a></p>
