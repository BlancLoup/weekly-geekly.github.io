Habrahabr is a community where the most adequate discussions take place (and the criticism is mostly reasoned), plus there is a hit in the target audience. <br>  After the launch of the project <a href="http://2007.tagline.ru/">‚ÄúRating TOP-100 of leading web studios of Runet‚Äù,</a> many discussions, suggestions and critics on various resources arose.  Some of the criticism can be considered justified, and therefore I would like to clarify our position, why we carry out the project in this way, to tell, in fact, ‚Äúhow‚Äù we are conducting it, and also to answer a number of questions addressed to us, including Habr√©. <br><a name="habracut"></a>  First, a very brief talk about the project.  Who has not seen, can get on the site and get detailed information. <br>  <b>Briefly about the project</b> <br>  The project is a market research site development in RuNet.  The project includes a survey of representatives of web studios and independent experts, in order to determine quantitative market indicators (volume, number of players, distribution by region, portrait of an average studio, etc.), as well as build TOP-100 leading companies by market share ( according to market participants and experts).  Project site - <a href="http://2007.tagline.ru/">http://2007.tagline.ru</a> . <br>  The project started on March 14th.  During the week of pre-registration, over 300 web studios registered with the project and a number of independent experts, as well as information sponsors, were involved.  Now - from March 23 to March 30 there is a vote.  Companies that have not had time to register beforehand, have the opportunity to do it right now during the survey.  The results of the study and the rating itself will be published on April 3. <br>  We now turn to the main issues and complaints that criticize: <br>  <b>Critical complaints</b> <br>  If you take a justified criticism, you can select several basic questions and complaints addressed to the project.  Let's try to answer them and explain our position: <br><ul><li>  <i>The rating is not objective, because it is not based on real data on the turnover of the studios, but only on the opinions of studio representatives and experts, whose awareness is still a question.</i> <br>  From the point of view of the real assessment of the turnover of companies, the rating really cannot be called 100% reliable.  However, we are not talking about this anywhere.  On the contrary, wherever possible, we emphasize that the rating reflects only the opinion of the professional environment about the distribution of leaders, and not only the company's turnover, but also the level of its fame play an important role in expert evaluations.  However, with this reservation, the information provided by us is reliable and can be used as a real tool.  The problem is that it is impossible to create an objective rating in terms of turnover at the moment - the market is too smeared, there are a huge number of small players, whose turnovers are simply unrealistic to calculate.  Large companies also do not disclose their momentum.  By assessing the portfolio or the number of employees, adjusted for the rate of return - you can be mistaken at times.  And if with one company to make a mistake in the plus, and on the other in the minus - you get the difference in the evaluation of turnovers on the order of equal companies.  Therefore, to form a rating based on objective and reliable assessments is now impossible.  As soon as, and we hope so, the situation on the market will cease to be so opaque, we will immediately provide the public with data on the actual distribution of turnover. <br></li><li>  <i>It is not clear why this rating is needed at all?</i>  <i>It turns out the small party between the studios, and no one will reveal the really interesting data.</i> <br>  To the question, why do we need rating and research, I will answer below.  Further, the current scale of the project (more than 300 studios) does not allow us to talk about a cross-spree - the number of respondents is too large.  Regarding the interestingness of the data, won't it be possible for people working in this market to hear the opinion of leaders from dozens, experts, and just a large number of their colleagues who don‚Äôt make sense to distort information in general market issues?  I will not believe. <br></li><li>  <i>Rating - PR promotion of someone there, all places are purchased.</i> <br>  This non-constructive criticism, although quite frequent.  I will not answer it because it's funny.  And it will be ridiculous to anyone who knows the market and has seen a list of experts. <br></li><li>  <i>Nobody needs the data from the survey and will show only the ‚Äúaverage temperature in the hospital‚Äù.</i> <br>  It depends on how you teach them.  We do not plan to stupidly average all the data obtained in the survey.  We will provide the distribution of all parameters, as well as conduct a thorough analysis of all interesting indicators.  What exactly, what reports and parameters will be included in our research - I wrote below. <br></li></ul><br>  By the way, in terms of a constructive analysis of the methodology for conducting the rating last year, <a href="http://webplanet.ru/knowhow/research/vasiliev/2006/09/12/developer-rating.html">interesting material was</a> written by Dmitry Vasilyev, director of the developer company Aist. <br><br>  <b>Why and who needs rating and research?</b> <br><br>  I would also like to dwell on the question of why and to whom rating and market research can be interesting and useful.

      The target audience: <br><ul><li>  <i>Developers, studio representatives</i> <br>  Rating is interesting to representatives of the studios in many positions.  Firstly, self-identification of their place in the market.  Secondly, sports interest, whether we will get a rating.  Thirdly, obtaining real information about the state of the market.  And fourth, the commercial effect of potential customers who will use the rating. <br>  The study is interesting to developers even more.  For competent work, any company needs information about the market in which it operates.  The site creation market is in an information vacuum.  One fact that nobody estimated the market size before me last year already says a lot.  Most companies do not have marketing activities on the market, and information is very necessary.  Actually, the idea to carry out such a project came to my mind when real data on the market was very necessary - and they were not. <br></li><li>  <i>Customers</i> <br>  If the data on the market, customers are mainly needed as supporting information for expanding the horizon, then the rating can be turned into a real tool.  I do not call in any case the customer to use the rating as the main criterion for selecting a contractor, it would be stupid.  But as an auxiliary tool, one of the contractor selection filters is why not.  Moreover, following last year‚Äôs rating, I regularly hear about various tenders and projects (both for Russian and international brands, as well as for local companies), where the range of contractors was based on the rating.  Again, given the lack of analytical information on the market, the customer needs to focus on at least something, and the rating (with the correct understanding of the method of its formation) can serve as a significant help.  It should be remembered that in the ranking we are talking about the opinions of market players, and also only about the share of companies - nothing about quality, prices, etc. <br><br>  Ultimately, a careful reading of the research results and the rating will help representatives of the customer to avoid many of the mistakes that they tend to make.  Also, as, for example, the <a href="http://www.habrahabr.ru/blog/columns/6486.html">article</a> I wrote for Habr about typical managerial mistakes made by the customer when developing the site. <br></li><li>  <i>Interested / Newbies</i> <br>  The project gives them interesting information for reflection, which will help them if they ever come across the market in practice. </li></ul><br>  <b>What will be included in the study and how is it carried out</b> <br>  Let us tell you what kind of information and applications we plan to include in the final report and rating: <br><br>  <b><i>General market research</i></b> <br><ul><li>  Analysis of the current market situation (+ selected expert comments) </li><li>  Identify key market issues (+ selected expert comments) </li><li>  Quantitative data on the market and their analysis: (+ selected expert comments) </li><li>  Main trends of the market development (+ selected expert comments) </li></ul><br>  <i><b>TOP-100 studios</b></i> <br><ul><li>  The final rating of the TOP-100 leading studios Runet 2007 </li><li>  Detailed rating analysis, comparison with last year, identification of trends </li><li>  Selected expert comments on their voting options </li><li>  Comments "a posteriori" representatives of the studios of the TOP-10 </li><li>  "Small rating" studios according to independent experts, comparison </li></ul><br>  <i><b>Applications</b></i> <br><ul><li>  All comments of experts and studio representatives on all general issues. </li><li>  Distribution of studios by site development platforms </li><li>  Distribution of studios by types of use of their own / third-party CMS-systems </li></ul><br>  The rating is based only on the results of a survey of studio representatives and experts.  The study is based on the results of the survey, as well as our own group data.  As part of its own research, a catalog of more than 800 active studios was formed, and various information on them was collected and analyzed.  selective assessments of various market segments were also carried out, data were collected from a large number of client companies on the distribution of Internet budgets, parallels were made with the Internet advertising market, and a number of other research problems were solved.  Based on this data, final reports will be generated. <br>  In conclusion, I would like to add that our project is always open to constructive criticism, as well as any ideas.  We plan to conduct a number of studies on the market using other methodologies that we will try to conduct in the near future. <br>  <b>Materials on the topic:</b> <br>  And finally - a brief overview of the materials on the project and its discussions so that the full picture is formed: <br><br><ul><li>  <a href="http://www.habrahabr.ru/blog/web_design/7254.html">Discussion of the start of the project on Habr√©</a> </li><li>  <a href="http://www.adme.ru/news/2007/03/14/16056/">Material about the start of the project on AdMe</a> </li><li>  <a href="http://www.adme.ru/interview/2007/03/26/16353/">Interview on AdMe</a> </li><li>  <a href="http://www.webplanet.ru/news/research/2007/03/16/top_dev.html">Webplan Material</a> </li><li>  <a href="http://www.vz.ru/society/2007/3/20/73419.html">Material at a Glance</a> </li><li>  <a href="http://www.forumsostav.ru/6/19060/">Discussion on the Composition forum is unfriendly =)</a> </li><li> <a href="http://www.telnews.ru/theme/11402">Material on Telnews</a> </li><li>  <a href="http://www.seonews.ru/news/.info_news/1597/">Material on Seonews</a> </li><li>  <a href="http://www.e-xecutive.ru/discussions/forum_46252/msg_188017_1336932/">Discussion on the E-xecutive forum</a> </li></ul><br><br></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/5882/">https://habr.com/ru/post/5882/</a></p>
