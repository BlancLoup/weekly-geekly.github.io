  <section class="page js-page"><h1>REPUTACIA.RU is an honest business name</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Good day to all. <br>  The text is not mine - they asked to post it.  Knowing  that the project is quite interesting, decided that the information may be interesting for habrooys. <br><br>  Hello everyone, finally, we have made a beta version of our portal.  From the idea to the implementation took a little over a year.  Taking up this project, I am like a full 0 in the web industry, but confident in my talents and managerial skills;  I read a lot of literature, dug the Internet in the end, at the moment after a year of painstaking work, I‚Äôm not exactly 0, I‚Äôm probably already one ;.  And so about the project itself, here is a reference: <a href="http://www.reputacia.ru/">REPUTACIA.RU</a> there, on the first page there is a press release, maybe there is a lot of it and a bit of a bit. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Well, if in a nutshell, this is a new business tool by means of which each of us will be able to solve the problem of quality choice of goods and services.  And the second is to monetize your ‚Äúhonest name‚Äù. <br>  To those who say that we have made another dump of some kind in the internet, not even dozens, but hundreds, I will answer, we made the first and so far the only professional resource.  And it differs from the existing ones, in the same way that the yellow press differs from Forbes magazine, some are made for the Old Believers, so that it is something to wipe the ass, and the second determines global trends.  So we created, or rather, are trying to make "Forbes".  And about the monetization of the ‚Äúhonest name‚Äù, this is our answer to those who have miser, who say that Russia has no ideas of its own, everyone steals from the West. <br>  And so, what kind of animal is this, MCHI.  We made a self-regulated system, where, by the way, as a literate person in Habr√© can earn STATUS, in my Habr√© this is called ‚ÄúKarma‚Äù in my opinion.  So having a positive status, you can real benefits in real life.  For example: To get a loan at a bank at a lower%, to ‚Äúfacilitate‚Äù a package of documents insuring a car or real estate, rent a car without collateral, and so on.  These programs are already being developed. <br>  At the moment we are ready for the beta version, in September we plan to put everything in free access and start promotion.  Grandiose plans, I hope we will succeed.  While doing the portal, I often read articles and comments on Habr√©, there are many competent people, I will be glad if they help us in the development of our project. <br><br>  PS I know that for many, one of the desired and discussed topics, and from where you have money for the project, and which investors you were able to promote.  So, we do the portal entirely with our own money, there are no parents of deputies and oilmen.  With investors, it has not yet happened, yes, to be honest, not much and sought. <br>  If there is interest in our portal and my post, I‚Äôm happy to continue the story about it and how everything moves and how it went before this stage.  Those who want to see, write in a personal InGift, he will give the information to me.
