      The first photo clearly shows the ‚Äúblackout‚Äù curtains on the balcony and the morning light breaking through them.  Direct sunshine in these curtains hit only at certain hours and not all year round 1-) But even so, the illumination is not strong. <br><br>  You can also clearly see the three lamps on the ceiling - I don‚Äôt turn them off when I play with a computer or console. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/24f/e64/caa/24fe64caafec27cd49d571d658164d9e.jpg"><br><br>  The HC1100U (720p) DLP projector, for "parrots", has the lowest luminosity of its analogues (1000 Lm), but I operate it in economy mode.  For a movie, just turn off the overhead light.  The fan of the projector can be heard only in scenes without sound at all, but this is a rarity in cinema.  Thirty thousand two years ago, thirty five now.  Normal FullHD (1080p) models cost from forty five thousand.  I don‚Äôt say a lot about the LCD and DLP wars, but in my opinion for the DLP cinema it still covers any LCD.  And the grid between pixels is smaller.  I don‚Äôt recommend watching the 1080i, the 720p looks much better. <br><br><table cellspacing="10" cellpadding="5"><tbody><tr><td><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/a4b/74f/8a1/a4b74f8a1047f5904f8ecb9647aead70.jpg"></td><td><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/95b/9a3/c71/95b9a3c710009d238513c90db5e44efd.jpg"></td></tr><tr><td>  light off, auto flash </td><td>  light on, no flash </td></tr></tbody></table><br>  For those who ‚Äúonly have a wall in front of the bed‚Äù: this is just perfect for the projector, almost all these devices for the ‚Äúhome‚Äù category are made so that they project the image upwards.  That is, on the vertical wall, the lower edge of the frame will be higher than the lens (15-20-30 centimeters, depending on the distance). <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/e8e/0e0/4ed/e8e0e04ed0b925f8a95a017cfff7747f.png"><br><br>  It is not recommended to tilt the projector, although it is possible - you will have to play with the compensation of the trapezoid and others, and this is done in the "home" copies by processing the signal with a smart brain, that is, the pixel-to-pixel image will not work.  There are more expensive options with special tilt-shift lenses, but in short, they are expensive 1-) <br><br>  But to turn the projector upside down is the nicest thing: the upper edge of the frame is obtained below the lens conveniently located on the shelf of the device.  The main thing is not to forget about ventilation, but it is traditionally made by the manufacturer through the side or (more often) the front panels.  Well, not just a projector can be put on the cover - mine, for example, has a sloping one, but four rubber feet on self-adhesive can successfully solve this problem.  Or a special mount: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/43d/04a/f10/43d04af10b64fe7d65af85aad8ef2397.jpg"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/568/76d/2ca/56876d2cabd29f8cc7237da1b5bc4c9b.jpg"><br><br>  For those who will look for this - consider that ‚Äúspecialized for the projector‚Äù (implies 4 holes for screws on the underside of the device) can be an order of magnitude more expensive than the usual clumsy ‚Äúfor a video recorder‚Äù (‚Äútwo legs‚Äù).  Well, everyone is aware of the price of crystal warm lamp sound and heated cables 1-) It cost me 400 rubles in the nearest ‚Äúboutique market‚Äù. <br><br>  A replacement lamp for my device costs $ 289, which is about a third of the price of a new projector.  289 dollars "at them", up to 20 thousand rubles "at us", but I still did not bother with real search - 399 hours out of 3000 declared for the time being spent.  Be careful: where it is not specifically stated, the manufacturer indicates the period of work in the "economical" mode.  I consider it a pleasant bonus, that the projector, unlike the TV, will not be left on "for the background". <br><br>  In order to save on the lamp was purchased by UPS 525 VA (300 W) - there he is, to the left of the projector turns black.  While there were no sudden blackouts during viewing, the soul is calm: the fan will have time to cool the lamp, it takes a couple of minutes, not more.  An existing 450 VA projector does not hold, dying immediately when the lamp is turned on (even in pass-through mode).  I cite marketing tricks from manufacturers who don‚Äôt add the simplest battery, which would only feed on a fan, in low-cost models.  I do not remember the price, in the region of three or four thousand. <br><br>  The chair for viewing has to be thrown back, for my screen is suspended at the rate of playing on Wii, where most of the entertainment is ‚Äústanding.‚Äù  Well, drive back, of course.  Standing and waving his arms in front of the screen is quite successful;  Of course, if you raise them up, a shadow will appear on the screen, but it is completely inconvenient to hang up the screen above for the screening, and playing is not very pleasant. <br><br>  For those who asked about dvd-rips: rips, passed through the "improvers" of a player, can actually look;  however, I turned on the dvd-player specially purchased for this purpose into the system exactly once: I put the disk in, I was horrified, put the ruler on the screen, turned it off and put the player back into the box.  Here simple planimetry comes into play: on this screen, the resolution of 576i (standard DVD) implies a pixel size of more than a centimeter.  However, all this tastes.  But for me personally, such a large pixel and ‚Äúladder‚Äù of interlace are striking. <br><br>  Regarding the rest of the iron, the JVC RX-F10 receiver (component / composite video inputs, S / PDIF TOSLINK / RCA sound, DTS / ES, DOLBY, LPCM) with speakers was taken out of considerations ‚Äúfor the first time I still do it.‚Äù  Now I would prefer to go bankrupt a little, but take a normal inexpensive res with several hdmi inputs (and some upscaler for component vii, or directly a receiver with an upscaler) than get rid of the additional component cable (three coaxial) under the ceiling, plus it would simplify source switching.  Sub under the table, I'm not a fan of loud and / or bass sound.  Now the format problem is probably completely irrelevant, but it should be kept in mind: if you directly output audio through a digital output (HDMI video card / media player or SPDIF sound), make sure that the receiver knows all the common formats.  Six thousand with speakers. <br><br>  Prefix vii.  Wii as vii, what to say about it 1-) It performs the task of entertainment by two hundred percent.  Twelve thousand Wii, five thousand "scales". <br><br>  The cable from the computer to the projector dvi-hdmi ... It was necessary to take hdmi-hdmi and an adapter: it would be easier to add a hdmi-hub to the system or replace the receiver, and almost all video cards now have an hdmi output.  Now I will be izgolyatsya with a reverse adapter or change the cable.  Naturally, the prices of cables are very different from the place of purchase, and the digital signal HDMI on oxygen-free copper do not care.  Seven meters for 300-500 rubles, somewhere like that.  For those who are terrified by this sausage on the ceiling, there is a cable channel or a corrugation (now it is removed).  Yes, at the time they were on, I had a chance to see a ‚Äútough IT specialist‚Äù (besides jokes, really tough and famous), who was not aware of how a cable with a big plug is packed into a corrugation.  So, it stupidly cuts along.  It is possible to push the steel inside the cable without cutting it, if there are few of them and if there are no plugs yet or they are narrow, but this is a special pleasure. <br><br>  The screen turned out more than necessary, in fact, it was expected: maybe I would have to urgently move to another apartment, and I didn‚Äôt buy everything in my native city - I didn‚Äôt bother with the exchange.  Yes, they say, the image ‚Äúto spare‚Äù in black fields looks much better.  I do not see any problems in the white field around the frame, and it‚Äôs not too white if you watch the movie late at night.  But for those who want to gloss, I advise you to carefully consider the size and think about additional sliding black curtains for a different frame factor.  Three thousand rubles, plus or minus passatizhi.  Draper Luma - quite a brush gives itself, tudyt it into a swing.  Matte white finish.  It is possible to gracefully be bothered to cast a ^ Screen with a motor, most projectors have a ‚Äútrigger‚Äù output just in this case: turn on the projector - the screen unfolds, the curtains slide. <br><br>  I advise those who think about the translucent screen to find and see it live.  In my opinion, the translucent screens do not imply a movie at all. <br><br>  The foreground monitor, by comparison, has a diagonal of twenty-four inches. <br><br>  There is no HD media player yet, for none of the existing ones suited me for one reason or another.  Now in the plans of WD TV Live as the most technical and beautiful interface, or still HTPC. <br><br>  Finally, let me remind you that the larger the field, the more noticeable the eye damage to the glowing monitor / TV.  The reflected light of the projector is deprived of this. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/76061/">https://habr.com/ru/post/76061/</a></p>
