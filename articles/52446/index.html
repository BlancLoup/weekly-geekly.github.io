  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Start</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  I recently revised my views on doing business.  I had previously sought to create an atypical company, in which the central role was played by creating good working conditions.  Making a profit with this approach is simply a logical result.  Work should bring not only material, but also spiritual income - this is how my basic principle can be formulated. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a>  My name is Maxim Saveliev, I am the head of Twin px and today I begin to create a fundamentally new organization, based on the experience of leading companies in various fields, discussing and analyzing this experience with you, modifying and applying it in my practice.  If I succeed or not, time will show, in any case, it will be useful for me and very interesting. <br><br>  In general, I can proclaim the most correct things, but, like many managers, I have subjective decisions, ‚Äúforgetfulness‚Äù, greed in moments when no one can put me in my place (my wife works for another company =)).

      To solve this, in my opinion, the main problem, I begin to write a series of notes in order to remind myself of the slogans proclaimed in the moments of forgetfulness.  In addition, your comments, dear readers, will help me correct my own point of view, and they may be useful to you.  In these notes, I will touch on very different parts of the business, from minor office repairs to stress management. <br><br>  So, where do I start.  I have a spacious office located on the attic floor near the center of Moscow.  It employs 6 people who are engaged in the development of websites and maintenance of local IT-infrastructure.  The creation of sites is our main activity, we are engaged in four of us: a project manager, a designer (at the moment I am fulfilling his role), a layout designer and a programmer. <br><br>  Any company, including ours, is constantly faced with difficulties.  Problems can arise with clients, with employees, with the state, with money, with time and even with a manager =).  The solution to all these problems is my priority task. <br><br>  Here are the first 3 topics that I would like to focus on in the following posts: <br><ol><li>  Testing projects.  Often, the project has very little attention paid to testing the stages, because of this we have to go back and correct our own mistakes at our own expense.  I need to minimize the cost of error correction. </li><li>  Objective assessment of the ability of employees.  I pay the average salary in the market.  My task is to adequately assess the capabilities of employees, to give them a decent income and motivation. </li><li>  Timely payment.  Our clients are very forgetful and do not like to pay bills on time.  I need to solve this problem, having achieved mutual benefits. </li></ol><br>  I will deal with these issues in the near future and talk here about the results and thoughts. <habracut></habracut></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/52446/">https://habr.com/ru/post/52446/</a></p>
