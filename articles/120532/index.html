It is really cool and embodies the dreams and desires of many people. <br>  I really admire people who are capable of such things - to take something that few people believe in and realize it on a serious level.  This is just wonderful and amazing.  This is commendable. <br><br>  Today I am writing to you about your Android application.  It is wonderful.  I really like the fonts you chose and its overall aesthetics. <br>  Very good, what's good there - it's just wonderful that you did not go along with the functional to reproach usability.  That is why your application is one of the most beautiful readers on android of all that I have seen. <br>  And in order that you could make it even better, I will write a small review, from which you, perhaps, will take something. <br>  For the sake of simplicity, I will try to keep within three points: ‚ÄúLess is better than more, but worse than‚Äú just right ‚Äù‚Äù, ‚ÄúGeneral logic of use‚Äù and ‚ÄúSociality - eat soup, give a spoon!‚Äù <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br><h4>  Less is better than more, but worse than ‚Äújust right‚Äù. </h4>

      I repeat once again - you are just great, that having such ‚Äúmonsters‚Äù in the world of mobile reading as FBreader or AlReader as an example did a minimum of functions.  It's great and gives you people who have their point of view and are able to stick to it, no matter what. <br>  But there are things that we, lovers of reading on mobile devices, use every day. <br>  One of the canonical examples is screen brightness control: many people read at night and day, on the subway and on the street, at home and at work alternately.  That is, in such conditions that require different screen brightness.  Even when I stand on the street it is often necessary to increase (or decrease) the brightness of the backlight, depending on the battery charge and lighting. <br>  You have this implemented by changing the background color - it is great and convenient.  But the possibility of changing the brightness of the screen backlight is extremely lacking.  This is a real problem - yesterday I was driving home, I decided to read a book and exhibited brightness for about a minute.  A minute is not much - but this is an inconvenience that can be avoided by small forces.  I looked at the reviews - many people ask you about it - maybe it's worth it? <br>  It is also extremely strange for me to observe that after I click on the bookmate shortcut on the desktop of my smartphone, I get into the book selection menu, and not into the book itself. <br>  Given that both the application and the book are not loaded instantly - this is a problem.  After all, most people from the phone read one book.  They stop reading it when mail comes to them or it‚Äôs time for them to leave the subway car and want to continue reading at any moment.  And waiting time for loading makes reading not so convenient, because when a person wants to read a book, he has to wait for the download of the application and then choose a book to read it, and then wait again.  Long. <br>  This is not a habit that can be abandoned - it is convenience and logic. <br>  Considering the fact that the application is large enough so that the Android system would ‚Äúkill‚Äù it when loading almost any other application (on Hero, Wildfire, Galaxy5500,5600,5800 - checked by the familiar ones) it grows into a real problem.  Make the discovery of the last readable default book and you will win. <br><br>  Even for me it would be relevant to work with translator dictionaries, but this is a special case and is just fine included in the example of additional functionality that is not important. <br><br><h4>  Universal logic of use. </h4><br><br>  In fact, I am struck by the fact that having such a powerful chip in your hands as the synchronization of books on all devices you practically do not use it.  For example, a great accent would be the ability to leave bookmarks and notes in books for later viewing on a monitor screen. <br>  This is a real killer feature that unlocks the potential of reading from multiple devices.  After all, many do not understand - what is the use of reading a book from the phone or from the computer if you can read on the phone and leave notes or bookmarks for later viewing on the computer via a dropbox (this is implemented in CoolReader). <br>  But in CoolReader this is done with a crutch and it is inconvenient for many to use it, while you have all the cards in your hands.  And this may radically change the person‚Äôs argument - after all, every person before buying something asks himself: ‚ÄúWhy do I need it?‚Äù And answering this question, you increase the chances of acquiring a paid subscription. <br>  I want to read books and be able to bookmark an interesting place so that I can read to my friends or use the material.  Do not forget that people who read a lot - they want to somehow use it, so that it would not be just a waste of time. <br>  This can be a matter of pride or excuse: "I read for a reason, I spend reading work, I can use everything I read later in my work or in my book or anywhere else."  In any case, even if it is not necessary for someone and they will rarely use it - this will be another reason ‚Äúfor‚Äù when choosing a service and buying an account. <br><br><h4>  Sociality: eat soup, give a spoon! </h4><br><br>  Tell me, do people like to write all sorts of garbage about their lives?  Will people write about having dinner, popping green or seeing a new movie?  It seems to me that the success of Twitter, Facebook and even VKontakte is the answer to this question.  And now tell me - will people want to boast that they have read some book?  Or that started reading some book?  Or that they liked the quote from any book? <br>  Everyone wants to be known as intellectuals.  Everyone wants to stand out from the crowd. <br>  Give them the opportunity to do it in one click and they will be the best advertisement for your service. <br>  Just see how this phrase will look great: <br><br><h5>  "I started reading a new book:" <a href="http://www.bookmate.com/ctrlok/CjOdagvR">ReWork, a business without prejudice</a> "" </h5><br><br>  How about this one? <br><br><h5>  ‚Äú‚Äú There is a common sense in this: if crime is inevitable, then at least be organized ‚Äù: Terry Pratchet,‚Äú <a href="http://www.bookmate.com/books/MziUiHQL">To arms! To arms!</a> ‚Äù‚Äù </h5><br><br>  Great, right?  Personally, I already wanted to follow the link and read a book in which there is such a wonderful and witty phrase. <br>  In addition, other people will be able to write in the comments to the phrase on VKontakte: ‚ÄúGreat, I also read this book‚Äù or ‚ÄúNow I am reading, I like it very much‚Äù, and the third will see it, follow the link and buy a subscription.  After all, reviews have left his friends.  And he does not want to be worse.  He wants to say at the next meeting: ‚ÄúI read this book and I also liked it very much.‚Äù <br><br>  He did not want to read this book before he saw the message and did not even think about what to buy a subscription.  After all, he did not know that there is such a service.  And you, with the help of his friends, advertised him to yourself. <br>  Give people the opportunity to make srach because of a comment or evaluation of a book and they will be grateful to you.  People love to throw poop into each other, proving their expert opinion.  Habrahabr, by the way, is a prime example of this :) <h5>  No offense,% username% </h5><br><br>  Give people the opportunity to be your advertisement and believe - they will be your advertisement, paying you extra for it.  Everyone wants to be a bit special, not like everyone else.  Everyone wants to show their individuality, advancement, relative to others.  Give people the opportunity to express themselves through your service.  Make an emphasis on this and you will be surprised at the number of purchases. <br><br>  - <br>  Sincerely, Vsevolod. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/120532/">https://habr.com/ru/post/120532/</a></p>
