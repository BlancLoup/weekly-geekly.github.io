      If someone didn‚Äôt know, in MTS key departments, MTS give out 3G for free for testing for at least a week without pledge and special papers the flash modems advertised by them. During the next visit, the company could not refuse to pay for the office‚Äôs accounts and modem for test communication.  The test showed a connection - not great, but good, stable 40Kbyte / s dnload, and no less smart upload <br><br>  10/22/2009 <br>  After all the approvals and approvals, the office acquired, and I accordingly received in MTS the cherished flash modem for permanent use.  But ... How could such a vile situation have arisen when everything was fine with the test modem 2 weeks ago in the same room?  The modem downloads files slowly, smoothly, but it sends - 1 second is sending 2-5Kbytes, and 2-3 seconds of pause ... Sending 3 MB mail becomes a nightmare ... <br><br>  At first the suspicion fell on an extension cord that was too short - not to bring it to the window.  The extension was replaced with a 3-meter * with gold-plated contacts *, and the modem was placed directly on the window - 0 reaction. <br><br>  Then he sinned on the mail client - Outlook.  But - I checked through mail.ru and yandex web interfaces - everything is the same. <br><br>  The game went with the settings of the MTS software itself (version 11) - forced connection only to WCDMA (incidentally 2 - even if the modem does not see such a network, with an appropriate choice it catches even the weakest signal) - 0 reactions.  WCDMA sees, and moments - even HSDPA, but the speed is exactly the same as with EDGE.  Forced choice only GSM900 / 1800 also did not lead to anything good. <br><br>  I connected to another computer in the same room - I noticed a glitch: the modem catches WCDMA right away, but it does not affect the speed.  After that, if you switch it to the main computer back.  Saves WCDMA reception until a long shutdown (more than 2 minutes) ... <br><br>  It was very lucky in this case that the modem was purchased not 1, but two at once.  The second modem, naturally, behaved in the same way as the first, which upset even more.  But I did not give up ... And I came to the office of the OpskKK (department for work ..) MTS and made a complaint that they had been sold to the villains ... It was really lucky that my office was big enough, and they listened to the MTS request - they sent a specialist. <br><br>  Early in the morning, a specialist came to the courtyard of my five-story building to make sure that the connection worked perfectly.  And I made sure. In his car, the EDGE download went 25KB / s against my 5 - and 0 problems ... For some reason, the specialist did not want to catch the difference between the courtyard and the floor, and left back home, promising to come up with something ... UPD: from the specialist such valuable information was received that both towers, which I observe from the window in direct view, are 500 meters to each - MTS-ovskie, and both with 3G <br><br>  And at this time I was already running around the perimeter of the room with a laptop in my hands, once again making sure that the connection was equally ugly everywhere ... I left it, turned it off, went to the mountains ... <br><br>  And then our holiday came, 4.11.2009 ... for me, this day was truly a holiday) ... <br><br>  In the morning it was discovered.  that the connection was restored in full ... And the farther - the better.  From 40 already to 80Kbytes / sec, dnload has risen ... The multi-megabyte mail leaves almost immediately, and without any pauses ... And so on all day, evening, night ... <br><br>  November 5, 2009, in the morning I observed a smooth and ever-increasing drop in speeds ... EDGE was disconnected, only simple GPRS remained.  And then it dawned on me a thought, very simple, but so incredible ... <br><br>  Before the BS, the channel for the sleeping area is too narrow, and therefore on ordinary days, and especially at night, there are no speeds ... On a holiday, all decent people did not watch the Internet, taking time to sleep and communicate with family - and the speed miraculously increased ... And naturally fell, as soon as the holiday was over - in the morning everyone got into the network with such terrible force that EDGE disconnected until the load decreased ... This was before, but not constantly, but with a day-evening-night-morning frequency under our other regional operator, and it was connected with the hedgehog  the evening outing of all into the network ... And even earlier - it‚Äôs important on a dial-up, expressed in the impossibility of connecting after 19 hours from less than 5 times) ... <br><br>  The old practices were recalled, the promise of MTS that the channel for 3G is enough for everyone is forgotten ... Morality is probably not) </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/74583/">https://habr.com/ru/post/74583/</a></p>
