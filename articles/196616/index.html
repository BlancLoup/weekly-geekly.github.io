  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Start loop or do not believe everything written on the Internet</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage3/7ff/891/207/7ff8912072c485f1c562239054d8d564.jpeg" align="left">  This article may not pull a full-fledged article, but nevertheless, for a number of reasons, I would like to publish it in this form, and not as a comment. <br><br>  So, without diluting the water immediately to the point: <br><br>  After reading the article ‚Äú <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/195988/">starting loop: launching payload into orbit for $ 3 / kg</a> ‚Äù, I was delighted with the topic raised, but the link to the article on the <a href="http://trendclub.ru/blogs/space_future/7119">trendlab</a> alerted (it will be clear why), the link in PS would be fine, the author wisely gives only the link and does not pull out The ‚Äúfacts‚Äù are from there, mainly taking data from <a href="http://launchloop.com/">launchloop.com</a> , but nevertheless, the frequency of mentioning in the Trenlab‚Äôs article comments and the frequency of accepting it as an authoritative source is depressing.  The reason is simple: I am the author of that article.  If I had my way, I would have written about it in the comments to the original article, but the article was read only yesterday because of the trip.  Being the author of the article, I can state one thing: that article is in no way a serious technical calculation, many figures are taken from the ceiling, only the basic agreement of data and calculations has been carried out;  my competence is definitely not enough for the correct calculation and design of such structures.  Thus, I would like to urge Habr's audience to take a more careful look at the fact-checking and not to take on faith everything they write or refer to. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  I think it would be useful to talk about the context in which the article was written.  Perhaps habravchane remember announced competition from the trendklab on the theme of ‚Äúspace of the future‚Äù (unfortunately no link can be found), having some free time and interest in space, I decided to participate, as a result of which this <a href="http://trendclub.ru/blogs/space_future/6976">article</a> was written.  The narrative outline required a cheap method of mass launches into space, for reasons of interestingness and at least some Lofstrom loop was chosen, since the benefit, unlike the space elevator, is relatively unknown.  After writing the article, I wanted to fantasize a little on the construction of this loop, which is why the article appeared because of which you are currently reading this text.  I think it perfectly reflects the level of my competence to <a href="http://trendclub.ru/blogs/space_future/7246">assess the</a> judges of that competition.  Quote:

    <blockquote>  Just say, the results were a little different from what we had expected.  The editors, for example, really liked the Chronicles of Space Exploration, but the rest of the jury did not rate them highly. <br></blockquote><br>  Thus, I ask you to treat my articles on a trendlab no more than (hopefully) interesting stuff on science-fiction topics spiced with simple calculations, basic data reconciliation and references to various facts and organizations, but in no way as a serious and authoritative engineering article. <br><br>  As a sad fact: the article on the trenlabe is displayed on the first page in the issue of Google by the requests of the ‚ÄúLofstrom loop‚Äù and the ‚Äústarting loop‚Äù. <br><br>  I think that's all.  Thanks for attention! <br><br>  PS: I do not in any way criticize the materials located on launchloop.com and the very idea of ‚Äã‚Äãa launch loop.  On the contrary, I would be very happy if this idea was really realizable and someday it was implemented in practice. <br><br>  <b>UPD:</b> An appropriate disclaimer has been added to the trendlab article, I hope in the future it will help to avoid misunderstandings like the one that happened. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/196616/">https://habr.com/ru/post/196616/</a></p>
