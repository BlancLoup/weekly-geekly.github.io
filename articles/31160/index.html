  <section class="page js-page"><h1>10 ways to make money on blogs</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  1. Write about how to get rich on blogs.  There are dozens of successful blogs that are dedicated to blogs.  Sites such as ProBlogger and Make Money Online are full of schemes for how to get rich quickly and clever tips on advertising and home improvement. <br><br>  2. Sign a book contract.  And even better - to create a movie.  Many writers went through a blog on the way from the idea to the publication of the book, not attracting readers in the process.  Recently, video blogger Ze Frank found an agent in Hollywood, threw his daily internet show and moved to Los Angeles to sign a contract to make a film there. <br><br>  3. Find a job.  If you are looking for a good job, then the appearance of your name on the first page when searching Google will be just as important as your resume.  A blog will not bring money directly, but you can find a nice place.  I obviously succeeded.

    <a name="habracut"></a><br>  4. Take your niche.  Not long ago, some guy could just say ‚ÄúI love Tivo (TV recorder - Ed.).  I will blog about Tivo.  And all Tivo ads will get to me. ‚Äù  So this guy (Matt Huey) has already grown rich - so you will not be able to do the same.  Every day there are fewer unoccupied niches in the blogosphere.  Want to start a blog about squid?  Not worth it, there are already three of them. <br><br>  5. Get on the dock.  Attendance of the blogger with the pseudonym Peretz Hilton reached its peak in November 2006.  It was then that the photo agency sued him for the fact that the blogger posted photos belonging to the agency with his own signatures on the site.  The agency demanded that he pay $ 7.5 million, and he received a sea of ‚Äã‚Äãnew visitors. <br><br>  6. Let you get fired.  In 2002, Heather Armstrong was fired for having brutally ridiculed a design company from Los Angeles on her blog, where she worked at the time.  By 2007, her website Dooce still remains the only blog of the first hundred targeted specifically at women. <br><br>  7. Keep a low cost.  Although the revenues of the world's most famous blogger, Pepper Hilton, are estimated to be six figures, his office is a table in the corner of Coffee Bean Cafe on Sunset Boulevard.  He goes there every day from opening to closing, sometimes he buys lattes and constantly prints on his laptop. <br><br>  8. Find a great story.  Good old-fashioned sensation will not prevent any blog.  For example, the Drudge Report told the world about Bill Clinton and Monica Lewinsky, and Squidblog - about shooting a giant squid on camera.  Sensation will get links from other blogs, and with them will increase attendance.  Thanks to the sensation, the attendance of a small blog can grow from 2 to 100 thousand readings in one day. <br><br>  9. Find a buyer.  In October 2005, Jason Kolkanis sold a number of his blogs to AOL for about $ 25 million.  His main rival, Nick Denton, a former journalist with The Financial Times, has numerous successful blogs.  They are priceless in the literal sense - according to Denton, he is not going to sell them. <br><br>  10. Make more lists.  A common misconception is that users don‚Äôt like to read much on the Internet.  It is not always so.  Many people read tens of thousands of words online per day, but these words are broken up into small chunks ‚Äî e-mails, headlines, and individual sentences from the news.  Lists work according to the same scheme. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/31160/">https://habr.com/ru/post/31160/</a></p>
