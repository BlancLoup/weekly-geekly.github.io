Rules are created to comply with them.  Why?  Information censorship is a kind of analogue of the body‚Äôs immunity.  What will happen if any nastiness constantly gets into our bodies?  Surely nothing good.  Therefore, in the body there is a developed system of protection of its performance.  The same applies to any information system created for some purpose.  With centralized management, the definition of rules and control over their compliance is carried out exclusively by the creator / owner of the system.  The decentralized model implies the creation of closed self-regulation circuits, which ensure the maintenance of the system within predetermined limits.  Our habr is a typical such system in which users can regulate the appearance of content within fairly wide limits.  The administration of the resource initially defined the purpose and rules of the entire system and delegated some of the functions to users, reducing its managerial influence. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/5f1/6a9/b13/5f16a9b1346b4530824f17eda6fa52fb.jpg"></div>

      ‚ÄúWhy does he write everything?‚Äù, The reader will ask.  And he will be right.  The fact is that in early September, my account was blocked for a week.  That is - banned the most natural way.  Since this happened to me for the first time, I‚Äôm helpful to find out how it is there.  But I did not find any information about this.  At all.  The administration of the resource did not respond to the letter with a couple of questions.  And I decided to create this post, which may be indexed by search engines and will serve as some help for other poor fellows in a similar situation. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  So, in early September, I published <a href="https://geektimes.ru/post/280414/">my post</a> .  After 17 minutes, I received a letter to the post office as follows. <br><br><blockquote>  Come on, username! <br>  Unfortunately, I have to limit your participation to Geektimes for 7 days by transferring the account to readonly mode.  Not just like that, of course, but for violating the rules of the site: Attempting PR in profile hubs <br>  However, on September 13, 2016, the account restriction will be removed and you can continue to use the capabilities of Habrakhabr without any restrictions. <br>  There are other ways of early release: <a href="https://geektimes.ru/info/help/registration/">geektimes.ru/info/help/registration/#invite</a> <br>  Regards, Security Guard </blockquote><br><br>  Asterisks, I closed the link that was contained at the very beginning of my post.  If you open the post, you will see that there are a lot of links.  And the link was thoughtlessly posted, where the ‚Äúfamiliar guys‚Äù worked.  It turned out PR.  What does it mean?  We open the <a href="https://geektimes.ru/info/help/rules/">rules</a> and read the list of what should not be done on the resource.  Violated?  Broke  Come on ... <br><br>  So, my entry was transferred to the "Read-Only" mode.  The name speaks for itself.  What does this mean in practice? <br><br><ul><li>  Only viewing content.  It becomes impossible to comment, vote for articles, comments, raise or lower karma. </li><li>  The article due to which problems arose from the site.  Other articles with similar or other violations may also be hidden.  Articles that do not contain a violation - do not hide.  Published comments on the articles are not hidden. </li><li>  In the profile sections are available Whois and favorites.  Both selected articles and selected comments are available in favorites.  Articles and comments can be added / removed from favorites. </li><li>  Dialogues do not disappear.  You can create conversations with users.  You can subscribe to other users. </li><li>  My tape - remains. </li><li>  Publish - just like when writing the first post - begins with "Just a minute attention."  It also redirects from "My Publications". </li></ul><br><br>  Blocking does not mean the removal of user materials.  In the case of a temporary lock, the materials are simply hidden.  What happens in the case of "unlimited" blocking is unknown.  I will assume that a user can write an interesting article, get an invitation through a sandbox and access to his publications will be restored again.  But this guess requires confirmation. <br><br>  If links to ‚Äúproblem‚Äù publications will be opened by other users, then they will display a stub stating that the article was withdrawn from publication by the author or UFO (after all, they exist!).  However, the most authorized author of these articles will be opened.  That is, there is an opportunity to save these articles, if there are no source codes.  Here the problem is different - the author should be aware of all references to his articles in advance, since the profile section is not available in the profile.  It is worth paying attention to!  Because it is real, after blocking, the user will not be able to see links to either hidden or remaining articles on the publication. <br><br>  In my profile there was an inscription about the restriction with the dates from ‚ÄúSeptember 6, 2016 to September 13, 2016‚Äù.  On the 13th, I was expecting an unlock, but it did not happen!  Okay, waiting for another day.  After 13 minutes after the date of 09/14/2016, I was notified by e-mail that my account was unblocked.  Therefore, the wording ‚Äúbefore September 13, 2016‚Äù should be read as ‚Äúuntil September 13, 2016‚Äù.  The resource administration has been notified about this problem and promised to fix this bug. <br><br>  After unlocking the problem article can be found in the drafts.  The article can be published after editing all unfortunate places.  I simply removed that post in drafts and published a new one, taking into account the rules, as well as numerous corrections in the text, which accumulated during the week in the process of further thinking about the article - this process fades only after the fact of publication, otherwise you can edit and supplement almost infinitely. <br><br>  At this I want to finish my little story. <br>  Follow the rules, gentlemen, and make backups. <br>  Good mood to you all! <br><br>  UPD.2016.09.16.20.39. <br>  After talking with a representative of the administration of the resource, the list of what is available in the ‚ÄúRead-Only‚Äù mode has been corrected - the information given is now accurate for September 2016. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/369683/">https://habr.com/ru/post/369683/</a></p>
