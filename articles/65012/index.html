A little thought, I suggest such. <br><br>  According to economic research, <a href="http://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%259A%25D0%25BE%25D1%2580%25D1%2580%25D1%2583%25D0%25BF%25D1%2586%25D0%25B8%25D1%258F">corruption</a> is the biggest obstacle to economic growth and development, threatening any positive changes in the country.  Corruption is never completely destroyed.  And some minimal corruption must always exist - it will serve as an indicator that failures occur in some place in the state / economic system, and there it‚Äôs time to change something.  However, how to track it? <br><br>  Everyone has heard about corruption schemes: the story of the "school portal", transliteration in the description of tenders, and others. Broad publicity helped, at a minimum, to stop the unjustified waste of public money. <br>  However, there are still hundreds and thousands of opportunities for officials to observe ‚Äútheir own interest‚Äù to the detriment of the state.  These examples are implemented every day in all industries and public administration.  These include government procurement, law enforcement agencies, customs, construction, etc.

      <b>The idea of ‚Äã‚Äãthe project:</b> to create a website where people can anonymously disclose any of the existing corruption / gray schemes, describing the principle of its work in detail, and thereby help eliminate this scheme. <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  For example: <br>  - ‚ÄúIt is profitable for dishonest employees of the State Traffic Safety Inspectorate to create long queues for obtaining car numbers: this forces people to pay money for speeding up the procedure for obtaining numbers, and also generates a type of earnings - when some people stand in a queue every day, and every day they‚Äú sell ‚Äùtheir place to something different.  At the same time, traffic police officers pretend that they know about this practice. ‚Äù <br><br>  - ‚ÄúThe state organization XXXX of Omsk buys cartridges for printers at a price 3 times higher than from the official dealer.  Head of Procurement Department - A.B. Otkatchikov  The director of the organization, VG Pokrovayev, pretends not to know about overpriced prices.  There is no verification of the expenditure of budgetary funds by the supervisory authorities in the person of Podelyushkina D.Ye. " <br><br>  - ‚ÄúIn the organization , serving on a contract basis (in terms of repairing computer equipment), the Federal Customs Service has the practice of‚Äú writing out ‚Äùnon-existent works in an act of completion.  For example, if a mouse is broken, a printer repair is also added to the act of completed work.  As a result, the organization takes extra money from the FCS for actually not done work.  This practice is common in other state organizations served by commercial entities. <br><br>  Summarizing: <br><br>  <b>The purpose of the project: to</b> help reduce corruption in Russia to a reasonable extent. <br><br>  <b>Project audience:</b> <br>  - people who want to know the problem areas in the state system, and to protect themselves from the double thinking of officials. <br>  - people who got problems due to corruption and want to punish those responsible. <br>  - people who stood in the corruption trough, but who were ‚Äúkicked out‚Äù from the bread places, and now they want to ‚Äútake revenge‚Äù. <br>  - Employees of supervisory authorities, anti-corruption committees and law enforcement agencies. <br>  - members of State Duma working committees that make up laws - so that the holes in the security of the text of the law become public and fixed. <br><br>  <b>Site functionality:</b> <br>  - the base of corruption schemes, divided into categories by spheres of life, with the possibility of choosing additional filters (that is, it can be a net bribe, or a double interpretation of the law, or the ability of an official to create obstacles to business with impunity, etc.) <br>  - an opportunity to discuss and supplement any scheme with details, to give references to similar schemes. <br>  - custom evaluation schemes - by rating importance.  The most important are displayed on the title;) <br>  - the publication of measures that the state has taken on a particular fact of corruption.  Public discussion of these measures. <br><br>  <b>Monetization of the project:</b> to take money from corrupt officials for not disclosing "their" corruption schemes.  (joke) <br><br>  That's the whole idea.  How it will go, whether it will work, if it is implemented, I don‚Äôt know.  But it would be very interesting to look at it.  And another thing: I believe that it is possible and necessary to fight against corruption in the state, and it is not too late to win this war.  Otherwise, why then everything? <br><br>  So it goes. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/65012/">https://habr.com/ru/post/65012/</a></p>
