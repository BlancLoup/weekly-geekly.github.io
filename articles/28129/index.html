There was a <a href="http://mediazona.ru/forum">forum</a> and <a href="http://mediazona.ru/forum/index.php%3Fautomodule%3Dblog">blogs that</a> worked on the Invision Power Board.  In general, everything was fine, everything was yuzali-posted-communicated. <br><br>  Somewhere in late January, users were <a href="http://mediazona.ru/forum/index.php%3Fautomodule%3Dblog%26blogid%3D666%26showentry%3D42461">asked to rate the</a> new Mediazone 2.0.  Most rated as "basically like, let's see what's next."  Next was ... <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  / here it is worth making a reservation that the local local FTP was closed around the summer and access to it was left only for some large blogs.  for the rest there was a certain local exchanger-rapid: each user with 100 megabytes and the maximum size of the downloaded file could not exceed 30 mb.  it was fun./ 
      <br>
        <script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>
        <ins class="adsbygoogle"
          style="display:block; text-align:center;"
          data-ad-layout="in-article"
          data-ad-format="fluid"
          data-ad-client="ca-pub-6974184241884155"
          data-ad-slot="8945601208"></ins>

          (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
        </script>
      <br>
      And then they closed access to FTP and in general to all bloggers.  For them, a <a href="http://mz2.mediazona.ru/change/exchange">local exchanger</a> with a web interface was open (at that time it was very crooked and stupid).  Each gigabyte, files of 100 meters.  A little more fun, but bloggers were already starting to boil :)) I was also boiling, because  he himself led more than one blog. <br><br>  Since everything led to preparing us for the transition to the blogs of Mediazone 2.0 (which are by the way made on Wordpress (MU?) - I do not believe that there was no better system for this), which then (and even now) looks crooked and absolutely non-usable - bloggers finally rebelled and decided to go to their resources - even if they were external, and they decided to upload files to this very local exchanger.  The majority went to one forum (I will not give a link in order to avoid habraeffekt and PR =)), someone made his blog on WP.  In general, piled out and used only the exchanger. <br><br>  Then, probably admins of MH 2.0, feeling that there is an outflow of visitors and not everyone is watching their Yandex.Direct advertising - they began to wrap our nuts and ruin our lives in every way. <br><br>  / retreat: it is not very clear - why the administrators of the LOCAL resource hung on the portal (it was on the Mediazone 1 forum) some Non-local pieces, which, by the way, even though little by little, ate external traffic.  probably one more persecution for transplanting all on anlim. / <br><br>  Starting with fresh and recent events - ‚Äú1 connection per 1 ip was set.‚Äù That is, you download only one file into one stream, but with unlimited speed.  But we are accustomed to bullying speed.  Gobbled, yes accustomed. <br><br>  The most recent and interesting is that when admins perceive that no one visits their [bleep] resource (since the links are posted on other resources) and do not watch ads (such is the opinion) - <a href="http://mz2.mediazona.ru/talk/blogs/wpb/666v2/2008/06/26/%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BF%25D1%2580%25D1%258F%25D0%25BC%25D1%258B%25D0%25B5-%25D1%2581%25D1%2581%25D1%258B%25D0%25BB%25D0%25BA%25D0%25B8-%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B0-%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B1%25D0%25BC%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BD%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B8%25D0%25BA%25D0%25B5/">they also screwed the nut</a> (it‚Äôs worth reading the comments, as far as they got :)) .  Removed direct links.  Now in order to download something, you need to visit the file properties page, click download, then you will receive the file.  It was possible to tear out the direct link of course, but when it comes to, for example, an HD movie that is broken into 80 parts, ‚Äúthe hemorrhoid begins.‚Äù  Moreover, this link is only available for 12 hours, we made some kind of rapidshair shorter (by the way, we are waiting for the wild captcha as the next one :)). <br><br>  The next day, sensing the anger of users explained.  Thank you, neighing. <br><br>  <i>The publication of direct links to third-party resources made it impossible for users to familiarize themselves with the services of the Mediazon 2.0 portal, which is ‚Äúhome‚Äù in the networks of ‚ÄúUTK‚Äù PJSC and is intended primarily for broadband subscribers ‚ÄúDISEL‚Äù.</i> <br><br>  Judging by the general mood - their services have not surrendered to anyone.  But you yourself can climb-rate this wickedness of the curve. <br><br>  Actually now it is worth talking about usability :) <br><br>  Go in, let's say <a href="http://mz2.mediazona.ru/talk/blogs/">Blogs</a> .  On the left we see some kind of crap - sections. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/olpictures/2df/73f/94f/2df73f94fbc68c9cfc39b249effce1cd.jpg" width="239" height="411" hspace="10" vspace="10"><br><br>  Who drew it and invented TAM to place IT and otzhirat so much space on the screen - I do not know.  Well, it would be okay even when you enter any blog it disappears - it remains in place.  You can see for yourself.  As a result, for the blog itself, only a third of the screen remains on the screen.  And so in any section in general.  I am already silent about the fact that under sections there hangs a whole flash banner and poison advertising. <br><br>  Why tags from the exchanger are displayed even when I go on the news - is also not very clear. <br><br>  Now they began to pull up the design of the <a href="http://mediazona.ru/forum/">old MediaZones forum</a> for this misery - they made a new design for IPB.  I'm wondering now - will the selection of sections on the left and tags on the right be screwed?  : D <br><br>  In general, just sore.  We are fed up with this constant ditching of a local resource.  I understand that many providers have no local resources at all - this is their problem.  We had it, and now it is slyha, but there is no choice except to transfer to expensive anlim and download from external resources.  And I think that the usability of a new local resource (since I‚Äôm going to this blog) tends to zero.  I propose to evaluate you. <br><br>  ps I do not have any wild hostility to the admins themselves, they just somehow make everything crooked.  specifically or not - I do not know. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/28129/">https://habr.com/ru/post/28129/</a></p>
