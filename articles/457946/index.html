Hubbard</a></b> </blockquote>  The amount of data you need to work with is constantly increasing.  And the more information, the harder it is to handle.  That is why the topic of data visualization has become especially popular now - in the form of graphs, diagrams, dashboards, preferably interactive.  The visual presentation of the data allows us, people, to spend less time and effort on their viewing, analysis and reflection, as well as on making the right, informed decisions based on this. <br><br>  It is unlikely that anyone will deny that in the modern HTML5 web JavaScript is the most universal and simple technology for data visualization.  So, if you are engaged in front-end development, then you, most likely, either have already dealt with the creation of JS charts, or come across this in the (near) future. <br><br>  There are <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_JavaScript_charting_libraries">many</a> JavaScript libraries for building graphs and diagrams, each of which (like any other tools) has its own pros and cons.  To make your life easier, I decided to tell about those of them that I like most.  I think the following ten libraries are the best JS libraries for creating graphs, and they really can help solve almost any problem of data visualization.  Let's go through the list together and make sure that they are known to you at least in a basic way and you have not lost sight of any good library that may be useful in current or future large projects.

It would be very difficult to compare them all exhaustively, taking into account absolutely all parameters.  Each has its pros and cons, and the choice depends largely on the skills of the developer, as well as the specific task. <br><br>  Of course, there are some features, features that make one library faster, or prettier in terms of design, or more flexible than others.  But, in the end, it is not so important which libraries are in the list, because in the end the best is the one that most fully meets your specific requirements within a single task. <br><br>  My advice is to get acquainted with all these leading libraries at least a little closer: when you need JS charts to visualize data within a project, it is extremely likely that one or several of them will suit you best.  If you want to deal with a longer list, pay attention to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_JavaScript_charting_libraries">comparison in Wikipedia</a> . <br><br>  If you need to visualize data on interactive maps, where geographic trends, relationships, connections, streams, etc. are of primary importance, read my previous article on the <a href="https://onextrapixel.com/8-javascript-libraries-for-interactive-map-visualizations/">best JavaScript libraries for geovizualizatsii data in the form of maps</a> (on Habr√© there is its <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/318600/">translation into Russian</a> ) . <br><br>  Have a good day and enjoy the visualization of data using JavaScript! <br><br><hr><br>  <i>This is my translation of the article <b>Top JavaScript Charting Libraries for Every Data Visualization Need</b> , published by me earlier on <a href="https://hackernoon.com/10-javascript-charting-libraries-data-visualization-b77523d23372">Hacker Noon</a> .</i> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/457946/">https://habr.com/ru/post/457946/</a></p>
