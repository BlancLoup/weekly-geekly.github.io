  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Recorders for the book of records</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Did you know that the smallest voice recorder in the world, made three times in the Guinness Book of World Records for its miniature size, was made in Russia?  It is produced by the Zelenograd company <a href="http://www.telesys.ru/">Telesystems</a> , the activities and products of which for some reason have not been covered in Habr√© for some reason.  But we are talking about a company that independently develops and manufactures world-class products in Russia.  Miniature digital voice recorders have long become its calling card among professionals, and this story is about them. <br><br> <a href="http://www.telesys.ru/"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/ce5/3a1/110/ce53a1110b1beca0cb385f34afed339d.jpg" width="600" height="360" alt="45.47 KB"></a> <br><br><a name="habracut"></a><h4>  About </h4><br>  The company with the simple name "Telesystems" was founded in Zelenograd by two enthusiasts in 1991 as a private research and production enterprise, whose main activity was the development and manufacture of electronic equipment for communications.  In 1992, "TeleSystems" developed and manufactured the first in Russia AON, which became the basis of the company's business in the 90s.  Since then, the company's product range has seriously expanded.  Now one of the business cards of the company has become a series of miniature professional dictaphones Edic - for the past 6 years, Telesystems has retained the title of the manufacturer of the smallest dictaphones in the world.

    <h4>  Success story </h4><br>  Already in 2004, the Edic Mini A2M recorder <a href="http://www.wn.ru/computers/13.10.2004/2.html">entered the Guinness Book of Records</a> as the smallest recorder in the world: <br><br> <a href="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/d30/14c/3df/d3014c3dfe52301304e96be16ec95618.jpg/"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/d30/14c/3df/d3014c3dfe52301304e96be16ec95618.jpg" width="200" height="184"></a> <br><blockquote>  Possessing an extremely small size (43 x 36 x 3.2 mm) and a weight of only 8 grams, the Edic-mini A2M voice recorder has a recording time of up to 600 hours, while the operating time from one battery is 350 hours.  Such a voice recorder costs about $ 190. </blockquote><br>  In 2007 <a href="http://lenta.ru/news/2007/02/19/dict/">, the Edic-mini Tiny B21</a> , which <a href="http://lenta.ru/news/2007/02/19/dict/">replaced</a> it, <a href="http://lenta.ru/news/2007/02/19/dict/">came</a> to the book of records, which, by the way, is still available today. <br> <a href="http://pics.livejournal.com/kotkin_egor/pic/0001gh64/"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/dfe/68e/c7f/dfe68ec7f13e9048cd8a99a127282530.jpg" width="319" height="240"></a> <br><blockquote>  with quite a decent memory of 8 GB, its dimensions are 8x15x40 mm, and its weight is slightly less than 6 grams: </blockquote><br>  In 2009, the current champion in ultra low weight - EDIC-mini Tiny A31, the size of a paper clip: <br><br> <a href="http://pics.livejournal.com/kotkin_egor/pic/0001hfkd/"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/33c/c34/789/33cc347894fdde3345e32f9a6eaa31f2.jpg" width="297" height="240"></a> <br><br><blockquote>  Its built-in memory can reach 1200 hours, the sensitivity of the microphone is up to 9 meters, the voice recorder can work up to 25 hours from a fully charged battery. </blockquote><br><br><h4>  Features </h4><br>  However, miniature dimensions are not an end in themselves for tele-recorders.  This is a professional product with high recording quality, acoustic sensitivity up to 7-9 meters, automatically controlled recording volume, powerful memory and password protection. <br><br>  Another feature of the Edic dictophones, expanding the scope of their application, is digital tags, a kind of audio signature, allowing to establish the authenticity and integrity of the recording made on it, as well as the absence of its later editing.  Thanks to this, a record made, for example, using the Edic-mini Tiny B22 dictaphone, can be presented as evidence in court.  How and why such a feature can be useful in our country, I think, it is not necessary to explain. <br><br>  To test the capabilities of tele-system technologies, it is not necessary to be a pro in sound recording - a simple test in living conditions is enough.  For example, you can <a href="http://telesys.biz/use/rest/299/">record nightingale singing</a> at night from a distance of 50 meters. <br><br><h4>  PS </h4><br>  Although voice recorders have become the most stellar product of Telesystems, the company's business is not limited to them.  Zelenograd produces telephony equipment, security systems, decorative lamps, invests in startups, supports crazy projects in various areas - electric transport, solar energy, mobile homes, light airplanes and deltaplanes and much more, which I will discuss in the following articles. <br><br><h4>  Pps </h4><br>  It is symbolic, by the way, that the company is from Zelenograd.  In recent years, Zelenograd has really turned into an ‚Äúinnograd‚Äù, without any indication from above and accompanied by the constant drinking of dough of budget initiatives, the city has a real chance to become a real Russian Silicon Valley. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/94553/">https://habr.com/ru/post/94553/</a></p>
