History of the project</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/d2c/b4f/f54/d2cb4ff54d4b6aab5b8f7b5d165e84c8.jpg"><br><br>  I have long thought about printing characters online games on 3D-printers and fundraising with the help of crowdfunding to print them on an industrial scale.  In RuNet, I saw several projects, but they did not go far.  In the spring I wrote a fan of the game Dishonored in my profile asking to print the mask of the hero Corvo Attano.  At that time I just started to lead my group on VKontakte on 3D printing, and through it he found me.  After reading the question, it became clear to me that until now the mask had been made by a couple of enthusiasts, one of whom was in the states, while not intending to sell it.  And those who decided to make masks for sale, did it manually, very, very long time.  It became clear to me that here it is, a blank niche.  Of course, the figures of the top games were slowly printed, but there was no such thing for crowdfunding. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/751/395/027/751395027c28f1120a8dc025fa6ad602.jpg">

      Therefore, without thinking twice, I began to look for a team.  At first I found a like-minded person in the person of my programmer friend who was just about to buy a 3d printer, then he found a designer.  First, the 3d model of the mask was made by our designer.  The basis was taken from the three-dimensional wallpaper Corvo masks, which are freely available <a href="http://www.dishonored.com/revengesolveseverything">www.dishonored.com/revengesolveseverything</a> .  But the work went slowly and stretched for almost 3 weeks. <br><br>  Finally, the mask was ready, and it remained only to print it.  My partner has already bought a 3D printer BFB 3D tuch.  But suddenly there were problems with the software.  We tried to print the left cheekbone.  3D printer printed all the details normally, and at the end, for some reason did not print.  In general, we began to look for professional 3D printers.  Our familiar beginners 3d printers did not undertake this business.  Having gone around many prototyping centers in Moscow, and having met many interesting people, two things became clear: first, the detail is complex and not everyone wants to take it, secondly, if they want, they ask for a high price.  Therefore, it was decided to look for a 3D printer outside of Moscow.  First, we found a prototyping center in the city of Perm for a reasonable price for us.  Waited for 2 weeks in the queue.  When the mask was finally launched into print, after a day something broke and they honestly returned the money to us.  Finally, we found in Peter a freelancer a 3d printer working as a student himself.  He fulfilled the order in a week, made a very high-quality model and brought the mask to Moscow, as he was traveling to his friend.  Therefore, we decided to take him to the team. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/95f/dd9/5df/95fdd95dfc08b7552771ce20361111be.jpg"><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/5a9/a56/593/5a9a56593a001699810635d84c00d542.jpg"><br><br>  When painting the mask, we first chose a bad silver color.  He was too bright.  Therefore, the mask had to be repainted in a darker color.  Found wire and matter.  Red and pouchy material was glued together in one of the studios.  Then cut and glued to the mask.  Monocles poured from the material - crystal-rubber. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/bcb/bc8/dff/bcbbc8dff3c6c9830e500d10008898ff.jpg"><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/7bd/748/d51/7bd748d513b6bdc051a30a3689b805d3.jpg"><br><br>  At the same time, we found out the prices for the manufacture of the mask at the factories that make plastic products, and had previously agreed on the order.  Also found a company that is ready to paint and collect a batch of masks. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/28a/c9a/fe2/28ac9afe24758288e627bf6392255853.jpg"><br><br>  Finally, the finish line - we put the project on a boomstarter.  Now it remains to find out how much the Corvo mask is needed to the Dishonored game fan communities. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/564/37f/78e/56437f78edddb37c0445f366212ca280.jpg"><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/296/963/514/296963514d8eb0f583635174fbab84a9.jpg"><br><br>  And we gave the first prototype to our very first customer, who encouraged us to this experiment. <br><br>  Video presentation of the mask and the solemn presentation of the first happy owner of a mask Corvo. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/sLg8E3vkhFk&amp;xid=17259,1500000,15700022,15700186,15700191,15700253,15700255&amp;usg=ALkJrhhUkEw8WEyaIatKpcXdcniBk-rWlA" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/204660/">https://habr.com/ru/post/204660/</a></p>
