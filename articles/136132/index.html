Answers to these questions will be received by you during the reading of this article. <br>  After registering, each user receives his own page and the ability to create pages of cities, public institutions (places), shops and, of course, interest groups (to some extent without them).

    <h4>  Project Objectives </h4><br>  We want to unite the inhabitants of each city and collect the base of cities with photos from the residents of these cities themselves, so to speak, in the first person, which will further enable people to ‚Äúvisit‚Äù various cities of many countries of the world.  In these cities, residents can add not only photos, but also vacancies, announcements, gifts, finds and, of course, place a dating profile.  Each city will acquire its own page on the Internet, on which it will be possible to notify its residents and even guests about any events or news. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/f64/58d/630/f6458d630047027641128529d5a80675.png" alt="image"><br>  <i>Fig.</i>  <i>1. A snapshot of the page of Nizhny Novgorod.</i>  <i>(www.navidu.com/city/NiNo)</i> <br><br>  The site also has the ability to create pages of public places where you can leave reviews, as well as add photos of the interior.  After that, you can pick up places of recreation and entertainment, according to reviews and interior.  Some of the pages of places will be displayed on the main page of the city. <br><br>  Pages of cities and places can be specified as visited by you, thus they will be displayed in the sections "Cities" and "Places" that will provide quick access to the pages of cities and places you need. <br><br>  Shop pages are also an important part of the project.  Having created a store page, it will be possible to create storefronts in which it will be possible to upload photos of goods with a description and price. <br><br>  Well, the most important task for this project is to introduce the capabilities of the ‚ÄúDelivery‚Äù service, which is found on the pages of places and stores. <br>  The Delivery service enables people to order home delivery at pizzerias, sushi bars and other establishments.  That is, the user enters the page of the pizza restaurant ‚ÄúQWE Pizzeria‚Äù goes to the delivery section, where there is a tabular menu in which he can select the pizza he needs by description or appearance (it is possible to attach an image to each product) and then indicate the address where it is needed deliver the order and phone number just in case. <br>  The delivery operator, who is in the ‚ÄúQWE Pizzeria‚Äù with the help of a special program, receives a user's order within a minute, prints it, and delivers the order to the address specified by the customer. <br><br>  Pages of cities, places, shops can be created by any registered user. <br><br><h4>  Free advertising pages of places, shops and interest groups. </h4><br>  If you are the owner of the page of a place or store and have implemented a delivery order using the ‚ÄúDelivery‚Äù service, then your page will be advertised to all users who indicate the city where your place or store is located. <br>  Interest groups are always advertised to all users if it does not have a city listed.  If the city is specified, it will be advertised only to those users who have the same city as the group. <br>  Now this advertising is free and most likely it will always be free. <br><br><h4>  Who is this site for? </h4><br>  For owners of public institutions and shops who want to ensure communication with their customers.  Notify them about discounts, events and other information. <br>  For residents of cities and towns less, who want to be aware of the events of their city, interact with residents, share all sorts of information and much more. <br>  For people who want to find a place for recreation and entertainment on the interior, reviews, and not only in your city. <br>  For people who believe that the phone is the last century and now everything must be done using the Internet.  For example, order the delivery of products, goods at home. <br>  For people who want to pick up something on the Internet, and then just go where you need and buy it, or even order home delivery. <br>  For lovers of social networks and online communication.  Since Na Kida has all the features of a modern social network. <br><br><h4>  Realized Services </h4><br>  Users have 18 services.  Among them are "Polls", "Internet", "Announcements", "Gifts", "Publications", "Library". <br>  Pages of cities are equipped with 2 services. <br>  Pages of interest groups have 6 services. <br>  The site pages have 4 services.  Among them are "Delivery", "Offers". <br>  For stores sold 3 services.  Among them are "Delivery", "Showcase". <br><br><h4>  Team </h4><br>  At the moment, there are only two of us and both programmers are fortunately in different areas, but this resource also requires other specialists who are not there yet.  All interested enthusiasts to participate, please write by e-mail, and do not forget to write a little about your skills, and how you can help this project.  The deployment will be in Nizhny Novgorod. <br><br><h4>  Future plans </h4><br>  1. Assemble a team; <br>  2. Attract pizzerias, sushi bars and other places for the implementation of the Delivery service; <br>  3. Find an investor. <br><br><h4>  In the end ... </h4><br>  I would be very grateful for your reasonable feedback and comments. <br><br>  Email for suggestions, requests, etc .: company@navidu.com <br><br>  <b>PS</b> In the future, we will talk about all the innovations in Habr√©. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/136132/">https://habr.com/ru/post/136132/</a></p>
