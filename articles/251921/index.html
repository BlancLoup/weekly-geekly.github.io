One of the key aspects of this upgrade is the consolidation of the server infrastructure.  Using a small number of more efficient models of servers instead of more unproductive allows customers to save space, power consumption and license fees and simplify management.  In this article we will talk about updating the model range of Fujitsu PRIMERGY servers of the standard architecture, executed in various form factors. <br><habracut text=" "><br>  In the "cloudy" era, in addition to the ever-increasing demands for equipment performance, the factor of convenience of providing resources comes first.  The proliferation of cloud infrastructures also requires the maximum return on each ruble invested in server hardware. <br><br>  Today, the Fujitsu portfolio includes many x86 server models.  They can be divided into several categories - cost-effective expandable servers for SMBs and branches;  universal scalable high-performance rack servers;  platforms for converged infrastructures designed for high computing efficiency;  high-density platforms for high-performance, cloud and hyper-convergent computing;  platforms for in-memory computing and mission critical applications.  Fujitsu has updated the range of servers in almost all categories. <br><br>  <b>Tower servers</b>

      The initial level is represented by new models PRIMERGY TX1310 / 1320/1330.  They can be used as a first server and for 1C applications, a mail server, a branch server, etc.  They work on the basis of Intel Xeon E3 processors and support up to 32 GB of RAM.  These servers can be used with 2.5 or 3.5 inch hard drives with hot swap.  The TX1330 also supports hot swapping of power supplies.  These are entry-level servers that can be installed not only in the cabinet, but also under the table, since they are assembled in a ‚Äútower‚Äù form factor, and their noise level is only 22-24 dB.  For small businesses, which often lack dedicated server room, this moment is very relevant. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/8a9/378/992/8a9378992bce44bbbd72c43e80e2ac42.jpg"><habracut><br>  <i>Fujitsu PRIMERGY TX1320 M1</i> <br><br>  For the average load, the TX2540 M1 model is based on two Intel Xeon E5-2400 v2 processors, supporting up to 192 GB of RAM.  This server is positioned for medium-sized businesses (25-50 people) and is well suited for deploying virtualization and loaded applications that require increased performance of dual-processor machines.  Thanks to the ‚Äútower‚Äù design and low noise level, the TX2540 M1 can also be installed under the table. <br><br>  <b>Rack servers</b> <br><br>  In the PRIMERGY rack (rack) server segment today, Fujitsu offers four models - RX1330 M1, RX2520 M1, RX2530 M1, RX2540 M1.  Three machines of this series have analogues in the previous product lines, with the exception of the model RX2520 M1.  This is an absolute novelty without predecessors, which is an affordable two-socket solution for small businesses.  The older models of this line RX2530 M1, RX2540 M1 are based on Intel Xeon E5-2600 v3 processors, which were announced in September last year.  Each of these processors has 18 cores in one socket (a total of 36 cores) and a 45 MB cache.  Supported 1.5 TB RAM DDR4.  Also in the older models of the line appeared support for Fujitsu DynamicLom Technology.  This means that the chip responsible for network connections is soldered on the motherboard, which allows you to quickly and conveniently adapt to the network interfaces that the customer needs at the moment.  Today, DynamicLom technology supports 2 and 4 ports of 1 Gb / s or 2 ports of 10 Gb / s.  In the future, the manufacturer promises to support 4 ports of 10 Gbit / s and 1 port of 40 Gbit / s.  Also, this chip supports up to 8 virtual network ports, that is, up to 8 virtual network cards with which the operating system can work as with physical ones. <br><br>  The RX1330 M1 server is a low-cost solution for SMB.  Possible scenarios of use - application server "1C", mail server or server branches.  The model is based on Intel Xeon E3 processor, supports up to 32 GB of RAM and up to 10 2.5-inch hard drives with hot-swap function, as well as two power supplies. <br><br>  Model RX2520 M1 is designed to work with average loads and can be used as a server for virtualization and backup.  It runs on an Intel Xeon E5-2400 v2 processor, supports up to 192 GB of RAM, 12 3.5-inch hard drives, or 16 hot-swappable 16 hard drives. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/e3f/018/b0c/e3f018b0cbeb41f89d56ba10a458c1be.jpg"><habracut><br>  <i>Fujitsu PRIMERGY RX2530 M1</i> <br><br>  Older RX2530 M1 and RX2540 M1 models are optimal for high loads and are a good choice for data centers.  They are based on Intel Xeon E5-2600 v3 processors, support up to 1.5 TB of RAM and up to 12 3.5-inch hard drives, or 28 hot-swappable 28 hard drives.  Installation of the loader SATA DOM / USB / UFM is also provided. <br><br>  For the highest loads, the RX4770 M1 Hi-End model is used, which can be used as a server for ERP or CRM systems, a database server or virtualization.  The model is based on Intel Xeon E7-4800 v2 processors (up to 4 processors), supports up to 6 TB of RAM, up to 8 2.5-inch SAS hard drives, or 4 2.5-inch PCIe hard drives with hot-swappable function.  The ability to connect hard drives directly to PCI-e contributes to an increase in the performance of their work. <br><br>  <b>Clouds and Clusters</b> <br><br>  The family of servers for cloud infrastructure and high-performance clusters PRIMERGY Scale-Out Systems has also been updated.  Younger Blade-models BX2560 / 2580 are positioned by the manufacturer as a consolidation server, application server, infrastructure server or virtualization server.  They are based on Intel Xeon E5-2600 v3, have up to 16 DDR4 RAM slots or up to 24 ECC RAM slots with support up to 1.5 TB.  These models use up to 2 hot-swappable SAS / SATA 2.5-inch hard drives or 1.8-inch SSDs. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/762/cdb/e1b/762cdbe1ba1444a193d61c98a5154c6e.jpg"><habracut><br>  <i>Fujitsu PRIMERGY BX2560 M1</i> <br><br>  It also supports DynamicLom technology and the installation of a SATA DOM or UFM bootloader.  These models can be ordered from Fujitsu partners already from February.  The server cluster with two CX420 S1 nodes (Cluster in Box) is a solution for small and medium businesses based on Windows Server 2012 at a very affordable price. <br><br>  <b>Software</b> <br><br>  Together with servers, Fujitsu also supplies OEM software.  In particular, the Windows Server Foundation 2012 R2 operating system is supplied with the youngest model for a small office.  Microsoft only allows this system to distribute with new servers to large manufacturers.  This price offer is more profitable than the products of small manufacturers who have the right to install only Windows Server Standard 2012. The customer can purchase software support packages directly from Fujitsu.  Especially for a number of applications, Fujitsu offers pre-configured solutions.  These include, for example, VMware vSan Ready Node.  There are similar solutions for software products from Microsoft and other companies.  Another configured solution is vShape 50 based on the ETERNUS DX100 S3 storage system, designed for 50 virtual machines.  Especially for backup using Symantec Backup Exec 2014, there is a ready-made solution based on the RX2520 server. <br><br>  In conclusion, it is worth noting that Fujitsu servers of standard architecture are sold at a low and competitive price on the market, their design is specifically designed to ensure maximum reliability, and they also offer the highest computing density in the industry (per unit of the mounting rack). </habracut></habracut></habracut></habracut></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/251921/">https://habr.com/ru/post/251921/</a></p>
