I will try to present the disturbances as short as possible,%% username% is interested in your opinion. <br><br>  Connected to Megafon since 2003 (as a legal entity), almost all this time was spending per month in the region of 1000-1500 rubles.  (over 7 years, Megafon earned me about 100 thousand rubles.) I was always satisfied with the tariff line and rarely had any inconvenience, but lately there have often been service problems, and so it turns out, to solve these absurd problems, you have to spend its time. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a>

    <ul><li>  All 7 years, every month a courier arrives at the organization and brings a pack of accounting documents to all the phones registered to the organization.  One day, the documents to my number stopped coming.  When I called the support service, they told me that my address was erased and that I manually filled it in on the Megaphone website in the service guide, which I tried to do, but the documents did not come.  After the second call I was told that I already needed a letterhead to enable the document delivery service.  (In the Megaphone for legal entities, any disconnection and activation of services should be made only after receiving a letterhead from the organization on which the phone is registered) The lovely girl could not explain to me how it turned out that this service was turned off.  After I came to the office of Megaphone, so that they specifically explained to me what had happened.  It turned out that the courier could not find the address, which led to the disconnection of the service.  Moreover, they tried to explain me in a light form <i>that Megafon had too many clients to report such problems personally to the client</i> ... <br><br></li><li>  For all the time of connection from MegaFon advertising came very rarely.  But with the onset of the crisis, almost every week, they began to send SMS messages advertising all sorts of lotteries and additional services, which honestly did not really bother me until these messages began to arrive late at night or early in the morning on a day off.  Having called the support service, as always, I was informed that in order to turn off the service I need to send a letter on company letterhead !!! <br><br></li><li>  For all the services on my phone and for their cost, I always watched in the Service Guide.  I got used to the fact that on the 1st of every month my subscription fee is charged, after which the amount on my account does not change until the balance is replenished and the new subscription fee is withdrawn, and such a settlement system is more than convenient!  BUT recently I noticed that my account decreases by several rubles every day.  After the call to support I was informed that now the service to replace the dial tone costs 2 rubles per day ... To be honest, I do not remember how much this service cost per month before, but this is not the point. <br><br>  DO YOU UNDERSTAND FROM THIS TABLE HOW MUCH DO I NEED TO PAY PER MONTH FOR SERVICES? <br><br></li><li>  And finally, about pettiness.  Sometimes it was my fault that the money did not have time to come to the account before the subscription fee was withdrawn, earlier in this case I went and paid in cash the day before the end of the month.  But the number is registered on jur.  the person and after the accounting check I was forbidden to do it, because because of this it is impossible to reduce the documents.  Now, when the money sent is not credited to the account on the day of the subscription fee, outgoing calls are simply turned off.  If you call and ask to turn on the phone for a day, the manager, as always, very nicely answers that there is no such possibility and in order to turn on the connection you need to send a copy of the payment by fax.  By sending this payment, it is processed for about a day, after which the money comes.  By the way, money for those days of disconnecting doesn‚Äôt return to Megafon, although in my opinion this is not correct (with a subscription fee of 1000 rubles per month, it‚Äôs about 30 rubles per day).  Megaphone is trying to get as much profit as possible without thinking about the convenience of its customers!  <b>And the most important question is, how long does it take to use the services of Megaphone so that they can trust the client?</b> </li></ul></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/78938/">https://habr.com/ru/post/78938/</a></p>
