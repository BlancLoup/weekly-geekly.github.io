      <b>At the conference you will tell about DEPLOY.RB.</b>  <b>Can you say a few words about the future report without spoilers?</b> <br><br>  I really want to hope that my report and the results of the work that I have done will help advanced programmers to find some technical points in the new Rails 5. But I would also like more beginners to learn about this report.  To them, my work can help quickly start working with Rails.  The report is called Deploy.rb, and it‚Äôs about how to ensure that a real Rails 5 application is launched on a production-like server within 5 minutes.  Having spent the minimum amount of time it is possible to achieve results on a real server, with already existing prepared tools.  Such as Redis, Sidekiq, search engines and so on. <br><br>  It is very important for me to provide a quick start for a large number of people.  Many people want to experiment with Rails 5, they want to migrate their code to it.  But people don't understand whether Rails 5 is ready for it or not?  Is it worth doing? <br><br>  My project will help people: <br><br>  - For experienced: decide if Rails5 is ready for production? <br>  - Give a quick start to newbies.  It is important for people to get a quick interesting result in order to start developing further. <br>  That's my story about it. <br><br>  <b>Why go to the conference at all, what do you think?</b> <br><br>  Any conference is a great way to meet interesting people, and talk on professional topics, share experiences, learn something new. <br><br>  We all understand that the reports can then be viewed online.  We, programmers, are rather reserved people.  But the most successful representatives of our party are people who communicate live with a large number of people. <br><br>  It is necessary to try to find new contacts, to talk on some topics. It is for this purpose that events have been created, in which their role.  It is necessary to fit in and communicate, even if sometimes it is difficult. <br><br>  I look forward to new meetings, discussion of interesting issues, I want to learn about new faces and new stars in our professional field. <br><br>  <b>Such a desire to communicate - a consequence of the fact that you work remotely?</b>  <b>If you worked in a company, would you not have such a thirst for communication?</b> <br><br>  No, we lock ourselves in even in a small, even in a large team, we still work in fairly limited groups, teams of several people.  Fresh air is always needed!  It doesn't matter if you are working remotely or in the office.  In the office, you also lock yourself inside your monitor.  You can not communicate with colleagues for weeks and months.  Although the biggest problem in programming is not code, it is communication. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/981/bb2/4e5/981bb24e5697dddb3810b4152e1d803b.jpg" alt="image" align="left">  <b>Ivan Nemytchenko</b> .  <a href="http://rubynoname.ru/posts/2016/S08E05.html">Listen to the whole conversation</a> . <br><br>  <b>In the past, RailsClub you talked about the project <a href="http://railshurts.com/">RailsHurts</a> .</b>  <b>Was it supposed to be a book, is it in process?</b>  <b>Tell me how this project is doing a year later?</b> <br><br>  I did not have a fundamental computer science education, and I realized quite late enough about the theme with patterns, principles, patterns.  For a long time I coded on the notorious Rails way, I did everything obvious: I need to plug in a callback - you do a callback.  The fact that DHH registered :) was done in this way.  Naturally, the projects turned into a bunch of you know what.  At some point, I realized the situation.  It just coincided with my departure from 7bits in Omsk.  On freelancing, I came across a project on which I was able to try patterns and SOLID principles in battle.  I tried, I managed to solve problems to some extent.  And most importantly, I managed to feel the spirit of this approach.  On such a wave, I studied a bunch of materials and found out a bunch of people who think the same way: the <a href="http://blog.arkency.com/">Arkency</a> agency, <a href="http://solnic.eu/">Piotr Solnica</a> , just the Lotus (now Hanami) that appeared. <br><br>  Then I started to give a talk on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3D0v-24qM6LNI">How to stop being Rails Developer</a> .  The name is provocative, it was specifically made to draw attention to the problem.  The problem is that many of them are Rails way, and Rails way is only good to a certain extent.  At some point, the project grows and becomes so complex that in this way the complexity of the code cannot be maintained.  Everything becomes very fragile: when you change something in one place, it breaks down in ten other places.  SOLID principles and patterns just save from this, and I wanted to draw attention to the problem and after the report I decided that I should write a book. <br><br>  The book is still on pause, but several articles have been written on this topic.  The site works, on it, for example, a cool questionnaire is made: ‚Äú <a href="http://railshurts.com/quiz/">Do you know where Ruby ends and the Rails framework begins</a> ?‚Äù A couple of months ago, Matz and DHH somehow learned about this questionnaire and he ruined the Ruby community once more.  A bunch of people tweet, about 20,000 went.  The people frightened a little. <br><br>  <b>And what is the analyst on the basis of this survey?</b> <br><br>  <a href="https://protected-retreat-8094.herokuapp.com/">There are statistics</a> , in it the number of correct and incorrect answers to each question from this questionnaire.  For the most part, the people respond correctly, but depend on the question. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/1b9/ae0/a49/1b9ae0a4907a53f322b9e277fc6dbbd9.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Interesting?
