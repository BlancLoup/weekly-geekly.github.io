But from this the headphones did not become less interesting. <br><br><h2><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/214/5c7/19e/2145c719e9b5ae08ca4095f8d3576aba.png" alt="image">  Inside </h2><br>  In the black cardboard box, in addition to the headphones themselves, there was only a gray case and a fiber duster.  Not at all thick, not even an adapter from 3.5 mm to 6.3 mm - it looks like the main portable market was chosen as the main task of the headphones.

The main difference from the "adult" ears becomes immediately noticeable - they are really compact.  Not such, of course, like the <b><a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/hardware/79669/">Koss Porta Pro</a></b> , but not as healthy as most other models.  Outside, the headphones are formed of two mirror metal ‚Äúcups‚Äù - it is, of course, beautiful and very unusual, but not practical. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/9e8/30c/437/9e830c4375bb51183a9944828432e3c4.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  The color of the cups can be yellow (as in the photo) or metallic gray. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/086/62e/9b1/08662e9b1b0b51c3aecfe2cd96399982.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Connects the dynamics of a rigid headband, which consists of two thick bent metal spokes, covered with a thick layer of elastic rubber. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/586/c83/eaa/586c83eaa04a1520ec341b12a2933c8f.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/b32/08f/b5d/b3208fb5d6ea6419a2d70f417677425c.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  From each "ear" is on the wire - after 40 centimeters, they are connected into one.  The wire itself is unusual (for such headphones) thin, but judging by the reviews, it is very reliable.  Straight plug.  Weight - only 160 grams. <br><br>  Headphones on the head are held in such a way that you can do anything in them: run, jump, convulsively shake your head under some kind of drum'n'bass meat - the pressure is very high quality, and because of this, everything is soundproof.  In fact, the headphones and hold only by clamping to the ears - contact with the headband with a head is minimal.  The reverse side of this medal - after prolonged wear, your ears can ache.  You can, of course, try to resolve the issue by manually intervening in the headband design (bending under the head shape - something like <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3DtANSftZKQdM">this</a> ), but the main thing in this matter is not to overdo it. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/955/097/79b/95509779bb95a6c433deb4fc6f5534f1.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  And one more nuance - in these headphones it is very warm :) but here the ear pads are somewhat small - they will not completely cover big ears from the Siberian frosts. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/af6/42b/c66/af642bc66907799a85b80ece219eab22.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><h2><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/bbb/ac4/1ea/bbbac41ea766fab24fe6d7ad747619f4.png" alt="image">  Sound </h2><br>  What can you say about the sound?  Headphones got new, not warmed up - as one would expect, I liked something from the very beginning.  But I didn‚Äôt remember what I didn‚Äôt like;  these were just some little things.  After 2 days of continuous playback of all sorts of things from the laptop, I tried again.  And then I really understood what the phrase "the sound was revealed."  In principle, there have been no particularly strong qualitative changes.  But quantitatively, almost any term from the description of the nature of the sound of audio equipment has changed significantly.  The very melodic and clear sound was lively, with excellent control over the slightest changes in dynamic tracks.  I liked literally everything - high frequencies, ‚Äúmiddle‚Äù and fast dynamic bass - yes, everything is real!  Any musical genres - from my favorite electronic music to rock or jazz sounded very worthy. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/1a2/2cd/d35/1a22cdd35e331915c1a00dd37a8bb34e.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Of course, up to the recently described <b><a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/hardware/77565/">ATH-AD1000</a></b> on a classic or the same jazz, these headphones didn‚Äôt hold out a bit - another class (closed overhead vs open monitor), a different price range ... But on electronics and rock they seemed even more preferable to me tight and elastic bass. <br>  In general, as with any good and universal technique, when listening to music in ES7, some personal preferences are not so important - because of the beautiful presentation of music, it is pleasant to listen to any well-recorded song. <br>  The only thing that embarrassed me was that some of my tracks in MP3 with a low bitrate sounded frankly tough and made me want to immediately switch to some other song.  However, as experience shows, this property of any such technique - the better it sounds, the stronger the flaws of the MP3 are noticeable. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/72e/9c5/0a0/72e9c50a03e9ad77239f25ef13d1fd6f.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Looks like a great sound - really trump ears from Audio-Technica!  And this model is no exception. <br><br><h2><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/af2/94a/228/af294a2281f2c106ec7aac2f877a8602.png" alt="image">  Check weighing </h2><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/881/117/ccb/881117ccbc836c685868fb19a2bf46c1.png" alt="+">  Look great; <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/881/117/ccb/881117ccbc836c685868fb19a2bf46c1.png" alt="+">  Compact size; <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/881/117/ccb/881117ccbc836c685868fb19a2bf46c1.png" alt="+">  Reliable design; <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/881/117/ccb/881117ccbc836c685868fb19a2bf46c1.png" alt="+">  Good sound insulation; <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/881/117/ccb/881117ccbc836c685868fb19a2bf46c1.png" alt="+">  Excellent sound quality; <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/24f/0ae/920/24f0ae920b085ead2e6d649649177122.png" alt="-">  Metal cups will scratch and get dirty; <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/24f/0ae/920/24f0ae920b085ead2e6d649649177122.png" alt="-">  Strong enough to hold the ears, ear cushions are not tight; <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/24f/0ae/920/24f0ae920b085ead2e6d649649177122.png" alt="-">  Thin wires; <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/24f/0ae/920/24f0ae920b085ead2e6d649649177122.png" alt="-">  Perhaps the price. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/2ee/c2a/8db/2eec2a8dbf2d0d77e20bbe57368327e3.png" alt="image"><br><br>  With the price, something incomprehensible is going on - judging by the dynamics on the Yandex.market, the numbers only grow over time.  Now you can become a happy owner for 4-6 thousand, although not so long ago, the ears were sold from 3,500 rubles. <br><br>  By the way ... rarely meet <a href="">such</a> reviews. <br><br><h2><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/af9/2a7/40a/af92a740a6d88eb7bf72752fca2cf022.png" alt="image">  The end </h2><br>  Eh, the price would be a bit lower and it would probably be ideal headphones ... for example, for home use.  It will just be a pity if these marvelous metal cups are scratched anywhere in the backpack - no case will save here.  But in general, the ears are more than universal.  And even, perhaps, I will not be afraid of this statement, one of the best in its class. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/180/fcf/081/180fcf08131bc79cfb33e8017c63e0a7.png" alt="image">  I advise. <br><br>  <b>Successes!</b> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/85811/">https://habr.com/ru/post/85811/</a></p>
