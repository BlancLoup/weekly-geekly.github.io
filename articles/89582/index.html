  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Ford The bitter smell of defeat. Contextual Advertising Experience</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  The launch of a contextual advertising campaign is a chore.  First, customer needs, terms, ads, keywords, minus words, ad correction, keyword correction, minus word correction.  Correction - writing - correction.  Some campaigns in my practice consist of 80,000 words, phrases and minus words.  Work takes a year.  Some campaigns consist of 10 words and take 1 hour. <br>  The biggest and difficult are the campaigns for the auto business.  Some keywords are up to 6,000. And the industry is very competitive, the cost of the request reaches $ 15 per click.  Even in the Runner for some requests up to 700 competitors. <br>  However, not about that. <a name="habracut"></a><br>  Moving contextual advertising campaign for a specialized technical center.  Sale and maintenance of cars: repair, painting, add.  equipment.  Normal medium sized business in the initial phase.  The site is fresh, beautiful.  Quickly clients will attract nothing except contextual advertising. <br>  We write: repair, maintenance, service, car service, and so a couple of thousand words that describe the work with the car, parts and components.  For example: painting a car and painting a hood, leveling the hood and replacing the hood, and there is also a hood latch and its lock. <br>  We remove all unnecessary.  We use minus words or other Yandex Direct features.  For example: we need a body, but the body is gone.  This is a visitor who asks about what kind of body there are for Fords, and not about where to buy / repair it.  This request to the technical center is not interesting, but they request a lot of it.  Therefore, the key phrase body Ford write: "! Body FOD."  Missed the plural and am-am-am.  Context money from Yandex, non-targeted visitors, failure to strive for 100%, the phone is silent.  Everything is fair and everything is bad. <br>  However, not about this. <br>  Launched an advertising campaign in Direct.  Specialized technical center, serves one brand.  All is well.  Spring - market revival - click went - 2-3 page view - average stay up to 2 minutes.  All indicators are normal.  The call however is sluggish. <br>  We convince ourselves that this is a crisis (spring 2009) and customers need time to make a decision.  10 days click grows.  The call is flaccid.  Very sluggish. <br>  Client is a marketer maritime - it is necessary to reduce the price and increase advertising.  Reduce - increase.  Click rolls 5 times higher than expectations.  There is no call.  The director of the technical center is throwing objects and constantly checking whether the telephone line, click, depth of viewing is working.  He is interested in how to determine the click from competitors.  There is no call. <br>  The client is already in apathy, he writes to shareholders that the crisis is not the time for a new technical center, and it is necessary, apparently, to shut down and something else about advertisers, site builders and other vermin.  Click already 12 times higher than forecast.  There is no call.  Yandex Deret eats money, shows brilliant attendance. <br>  AND? <br>  And nothing. <br>  Narrowly think. <br>  Specialized technical center Ford.  Excellent advertising campaign in Direct with about zero result.  500 dollars a day.  6,000 key and minus words in the Ford campaign. <br>  And it was necessary to subtract only three - Tom, - spirits and - toilet water. <br>  Along with our advertising campaign, designer Tom Ford with his perfumery entered the spring Russian market.  And thousands of the fair sex, having read glossy magazines, have begun an active search on the Internet.  Request: Ford, Tom Ford, Ford Eau de Toilette.  And there is an announcement: ‚ÄúFord.  Best offers and special spring prices!  And further, getting to the fascinating site pages about Ford cars selling and repairing them, they dumbfounded, for a couple of minutes, from such a blatant deception.  And even flipped through several pages in the hope that all this is a ridiculous mistake and that everything will be fine now, thus providing the necessary statistics on the depth and time spent on the site. </div>
