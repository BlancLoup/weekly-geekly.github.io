Ideas are both small - ‚Äúthe same, only with mother-of-pearl buttons‚Äù, and large, for the production of something in a certain way or to full-fledged commercial sites. <br><br>  But as a rule, they don‚Äôt live beyond ideas, they don‚Äôt realize any resources for this (home, family, work), it‚Äôs a pity to give someone ‚Äúfor free‚Äù, nobody will take it for money. <br><br>  Traveling across the Internet, I could not help but notice that the issue of ‚Äúselling ideas‚Äù at different stages of their development is not my only one, messages like ‚Äúhave an idea for a million, not myself, just won't give it, how to get money for it, at least ten thousand?

      The sites that have appeared relatively recently for startups, helping to search for investors have partially solved this task, but far from being useful to everyone. <br>  After all, investors do not give money for an idea or even for a good business plan.  They usually give money for the implementation of the idea by the author.  And what about those who do not want to / cannot? <br><br>  Having spent many sleepless nights thinking about the method of ‚Äúselling ideas,‚Äù I came up with one option that is itself a complete idea.  And since  I spoke above about the lack of time for their implementation - I want to present it to the public. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h5>  Again some lyrics </h5><br><br>  What is the idea?  This is a certain amount of certain information.  At the moment we are interested in information that can help make money.  A new diet for weight loss in 10 days is also an idea, but in itself it is of little interest to us at the moment.  But the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãhow to make money with a description of several diets is more interesting. <br><br><h5>  How can I sell any information? </h5><br><br>  1) According to the principle of morning money, evening chairs.  So you can sell movies, music, software, books, but it does not fit single materials.  The driving force in this case, the reviews bought, and we have only one buyer planned. <br><br>  2) According to the principle of morning chairs, and if you like - in the evening money.  So now some content is being sold, but it also does not suit us, with each subsequent ‚Äúinitiate‚Äù the idea falls in price. <br><br>  3) According to trial versions - read one chapter, if you like it - buy a book.  This is more interesting and with some stretch can be used to ‚Äúsell ideas‚Äù, listen to the description and get a detailed business plan for money, but I don‚Äôt think that according to such a scheme they will give a lot of money for the idea, it‚Äôs too likely that it‚Äôs bad . <br><br>  4) According to the principle of development to order or brainstorming - here you have the money, work on the result.  It works in some areas for ‚Äúselling ideas‚Äù, but this is more for slogans / logos, etc. <br><br>  There are more ways, now I do not remember, and I clearly do not know everything.  But I know one that, in my opinion, may well be suitable for our task. <br><br><h5>  We ship in bulk, we buy a discount. </h5><br><br>  The invented method is based on two "if": <br><br>  If you can‚Äôt get a million from one investor for an idea, then why not get a thousand of a thousand investors for it, and who among them implements - what difference does it make to me? <br><br>  If I‚Äôm afraid to buy one idea for a million, then why not buy a thousand such ideas for a million, and you‚Äôll probably like and shoot some, but will it be selling new diets or socks with mother-of-pearl buttons - what difference does it make? <br><br><h5>  And now the very description of the site service </h5><br><br>  When registering on the site, we choose for ourselves one of two roles: the seller of ideas or the buyer (call them what you want, this is me for clarity). <br><br>  <b>Seller</b> <br>  It can publish its idea on the website in almost any form, from the simplest ‚Äúit would be nice to make socks with flavor‚Äù to well-thought-out concepts with ready-made calculations, carried out by research and business plan. <br>  When publishing, he appoints a ransom price for his idea.  And for ideas at different stages of maturity, you can assign a price within different limits (more on that later). <br>  Everything published is pre-moderated by the administration for screening out frank delirium. <br>  Everything approved by the moderator is published in one general catalog with a breakdown by direction, degree of maturity, etc. <br>  If the idea is not redeemed within a few months, it goes to the archive. <br><br>  <b>Customer</b> <br>  Registered for the money - a certain monthly fee per month.  For registration, it is possible to lure demo versions of mature ideas, and later even with examples of successful implementation. <br>  Access to the entire catalog of published ideas without any restrictions.  (although of course as you fill the site, you can think of different tariff plans depending on the quantity / quality / sections). <br>  Any idea from the catalog, he naturally immediately after reading can try to implement. <br>  If he saw something really interesting in the catalog, he can, in addition to his subscription fee, pay an additional price for the purchase price, thereby removing the idea from the catalog, i.e.  limit yourself to the range of possible competitors, this will force to visit the site more often and keep track of new items. <br>  In addition, depending on the desire of the seller - you can also invite him to cooperate with any plan on the purchased idea, the seller‚Äôs contacts are transferred to the buyer. <br><br>  Accordingly, all sellers within a few months receive their small monthly amount (the sum of all monthly customer fees minus the percentage of the site divided by all active ideas multiplied by a certain coefficient of maturity of the idea). <br>  Those who come up with really worth things and bring them to maximum maturity additionally have a chance to actually sell their idea (the redemption price minus a percentage of the site), and it is also possible to get an invitation from the buyer to implement / work together / etc. <br><br>  Graphically, it looks like this <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/habraeffect/b8/59/b859d92d3204402c4ed6fabd13cbf127.png" alt="image"><br><br>  On this, in principle, everything, maybe I missed something from my thoughts, I am writing from memory and it is already deep night.  I am pleased to read the comments and answer some questions. <br><br>  And of course, I would love to use this site myself. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/114602/">https://habr.com/ru/post/114602/</a></p>
