This event passed on Habr√© unnoticed, although the work is full of amazing insights, and the name is significant: <b>The terrible Habrahabr</b> . <br>  The play has not yet been published, so I would venture to offer the habrovans a modest translation from Old English - perhaps it will interest someone. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h4>  This is a terrible word Habrahabr </h4><br>  <b>Characters:</b> <br>  <i>Gabriele</i> , Prince, 18 years old. <br>  <i>Francesca</i> , his bride, 16 years old. <br>  <i>Witch</i> , 20 years old. <br><br><h5>  Action 1 </h5><br>  <i>Gabriele and Francesca.</i> <br>  <b>Francesca</b> <br>  Tell me, Gabriele, why <br>  You frowned - noticed the tea? <br>  I don't understand this attitude <br>  After all, soon our wedding! <br>  <b>Gabriele</b> <br>  Not by chance <br>  Pensive my appearance. <br>  <b>Francesca</b> <br>  What say <br>  So worried, as if soon in a loop? <br>  Betrayal?  Enemy sharpened knives? <br>  Have them all be executed then. <br>  <b>Gabriele</b> <br>  Immediately! <br>  <b>Francesca</b> <br>  Are you kidding? <br>  <b>Gabriele</b> <br>  Yes - even sick to me now. <br>  <b>Francesca</b> <br>  Fi, this is arrogance!  Just before the wedding! <br>  <b>Gabriele</b> <br>  Please Francesca believe me <br>  There is some foreboding.  Learn to ... <br>  <b>Francesca</b> <br>  What, what to know? <br>  <b>Gabriele</b> <br>  What the witch will tell me. <br>  <b>Francesca</b> <br>  What other witch? <br>  <b>Gabriele</b> <br>  There is a custom <br>  Since ancient times in my family ... <br>  <b>Francesca</b> <br>  He's not against the accepted propriety? <br>  <b>Gabriele</b> <br>  That witch - grooms come to her <br>  For the oath of marriage soon. <br>  There is no ancient custom. <br>  <b>Francesca</b> <br>  Why be sad?  Go without talking! <br>  In vain worried. <br>  <b>Gabriele</b> <br>  Not at all. <br>  The world has not met the worst bitch, <br>  Than this witch.  Will crumble something <br>  And then I ... I would have kept my nerves <br>  Yes, I can not - custom to say. <br>  I'm afraid she will give us adversity <br>  When will she have a question to ask <br>  How we will spend years together. <br>  <b>Francesca</b> <br>  And you ask about something else. <br>  <b>Gabriele</b> <br>  I should ask her about the family. <br>  Oh, I finished playing, I feel, with fire, <br>  Although usually cautious! <br>  <b>Francesca</b> <br>  Ask, but suppose not about us. <br>  <b>Gabriele</b> <br>  Who then? <br>  <b>Francesca</b> <br>  About our remote <br>  Descendants, and let at least an hour <br>  Tells about his mirages. <br>  What is the matter with us? <br>  <b>Gabriele</b> <br>  May somehow <br>  And it will cost, even though I'm afraid to go. <br>  <b>Francesca</b> <br>  Ah, Gabriele, head on chest <br>  Bow to me and stand, my friend, brave. <br>  My baby ... Gabriele ... Well, bold <br>  Follow our upcoming happiness. <br>  <b>Gabriele</b> <br>  I do not like it, she-si. <br>  <i>Leaves.</i> <br>  <b>Francesca</b> <br>  And hurry, you hear, come back!

You beat your breath! <br>  <b>Witch</b> <br>  In captivity of illusions, schizium and allusions, <br>  A descendant in Habrahabr gazes down, <br>  In its patterns are bright ... <br>  <b>Gabriele</b> <br>  It's hard for me <br>  A madman for a family is such a shame! <br>  What is Habrahabr? <br>  <b>Witch</b> <br>  So, glass. <br>  To get carried away Habrahabrom destined <br>  Quite a few innocent people. <br>  Will come there once, but <br>  Not everyone will be able to return. <br>  <b>Gabriele</b> <br>  On Habrahabr night long? <br>  <b>Witch</b> <br>  All exactly. <br>  <b>Gabriele</b> <br>  In the glass look dull? <br>  Your prophecy will kill me <br>  No, I do not believe it is difficult to believe. <br>  You, witch, lie! <br>  <b>Witch</b> <br>  Items are not given <br>  To lie before people, even before you. <br>  We have forgotten how this long ago. <br>  <b>Gabriele</b> <br>  I am broken, destroyed.  What's next ?! <br>  <i>Leaves, staggering.</i> <br><br><h5>  Action 3 </h5><br>  <i>Gabriele (one).</i> <br>  <b>Gabriele</b> <br>  Oh my God!  I'm definitely disabled <br>  Since I heard about Habrahabr. <br>  Radiculitis senile broken <br>  And the gypsy camp is buzzing in my head. <br>  Just think about it!  Royal family <br>  On the uniform is interrupted by an idiot, <br>  Whom, look for a whole year, <br>  You will not find in the surrounding nature. <br>  Yes, better smallpox, hunger and prison <br>  Than Habrahabra slippery arms, <br>  In which my will be praprap- <br>  great great great great great grandson ... Here is a curse! <br>  How to live with it and overcome it? <br>  What to do, who will help the unfortunate <br>  When the flesh was not born yet, <br>  And the brain is already foreboding korezhit? <br>  Is this not the elimination of trouble? <br>  While prapra-prapra ... descendant is fragile, <br>  You can, prince!

All nonsense take <br>  From your source start. <br>  I said - in this place, here - <br>  No need to go.  What did you answer? <br>  <b>Francesca</b> <br>  What did the witch predict? <br>  <b>Gabriele</b> <br>  Nothing <br>  Good  Belly monster <br>  Appear - let not yours, <br>  And our descendant. <br>  <b>Francesca</b> <br>  Here is an old woman! <br>  <b>Gabriele</b> <br>  Upset?
