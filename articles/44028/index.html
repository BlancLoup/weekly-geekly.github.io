But once in 2028, let's say, they didn‚Äôt have anything, but in the last 20 years the world has really changed. <br>  How can we look into the future?  I know 2 ways: it is brilliant to predict the emergence of some new technologies, or to imagine that one of the existing technologies has reached perfection in implementation.  Take, of course, IT <br>  Why do we need it?  And then, that the community, reading in the present Habr, in the near future will create this very future.  Someone more, someone less.  Even if you think that you do not create anything, but just stupidly go to work so that there is something to live for - you are still a participant in this process. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  So, imagine that one of the technologies has reached its limit.  At the same time, let's forget about the technical implementation, just eat and work.  And how - we do not care.  This is an engineering problem, which means that it can be solved, it just takes time. <br><br>  For example, authentication.  Imagine that there is a technology that allows you to uniquely identify a person with an electronic system or another person.  In some moment.  Anywhere.  Contactless.  How will the world change? <br><br>  Most importantly, all actions of a person, all his social behavior can be saved and then summarized. <br>  It will be possible to get rid of money in the form of familiar papers, in the form of cards or any other physical media.  Where you need to pay, it will be enough to introduce yourself, and then everything will happen in electronic form.

      Documents disappear.  Everything.  Again, you can provide yourself, and set what rights, permissions, certificates, etc.  you possess. <br><br>  Disappear a bunch of material objects that need to carry with them.  Keys, tickets, cards on the subway.  No need to invent and remember passwords. <br><br>  All communications between people will change.  For example, a person comes to get a job, and we already know where he worked, what he did, what he can do. <br>  We will find ourselves again in a big village.  After all, imagine, you are walking along the main street of the village, and to meet you Petro.  And you already know what kind of person, good or bad, a thief or a righteous man, what you did yesterday, who you live with and who you booted yesterday :) <br>  Returning to a larger village brings another change - each person becomes more valuable.  And everyone, knowing that everything that he does is easy to become known to others, will begin to live differently. <br><br>  And what do you see?  Let's think about it.  Just remember - technical details are not important. <br>  Ethics probably too.  Because  in that world it will be different (maybe not much, but different). <br><br>  ZY: if we get something constructive, then next time we'll talk ... for example, about programming. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/44028/">https://habr.com/ru/post/44028/</a></p>
