  <section class="page js-page"><h1>40% of online store visitors are passive observers</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  After conducting a regular survey of Internet <a href="http://www.rmh.ru/">users</a> , <a href="http://www.rmh.ru/">ROMIR Monitoring</a> concluded that the key factors for success in e-commerce are the right prices and a streamlined logistics system. <br><br>  Questions related to shopping in online stores were answered by 2,296 active Internet users aged 20 years and older.  This sample represents the adult audience of the Network, which according to data for the second quarter of 2006 was 19% of the adult population of the country. <br><br>  Researchers have found that 95% of Internet users used to be at the ‚Äúpoints‚Äù of e-commerce.  According to the results of the May survey, their number was less, namely, 87%.  ROMIR Monitoring notes that the trend of growing popularity of online stores is recorded for the sixth quarter.

      Almost everybody visited online stores, and only 60% of respondents bought them in the last year.  Muscovites shop on the Internet a bit more often - 75%.  This, according to ROMIR specialist Tatyana Kozlova, is explained by the fact that most of the online stores are located in Moscow, and in other regions enterprises have to act through intermediaries.  ‚ÄúOften intermediaries are less experienced in logistics and management of online commerce,‚Äù explains Tatiana.  ‚ÄúNaturally, this affects the speed and cost of shipping the goods.‚Äù <br><br>  A significant share of respondents - almost 40% - visits sites of online merchants only in order to receive information about the product.  More often than in the sample in general, residents of the regions do so - in particular, the Volga, Ural, Siberian federal districts and St. Petersburg. <br><br>  Respondents also answered the question ‚ÄúWhy do you not shop on the Internet?‚Äù.  It turned out that for 44% of consumers it is important to see the product "live".  In addition, it is hampered by the lack of information on the product presented on the website.  42% of Internet users have not yet realized why they should buy things in such an unusual way.  About a third of respondents are afraid of possible problems with the delivery of goods to their homes, and a quarter of them, the process of buying goods via the Internet seems unnecessarily complicated. <br><br>  Even those who buy on the Internet, go shopping online relatively rarely.  72% of them do it less than once a month, 17% - about once a month, 10% - with a frequency of 2-3 times a month. <br><br>  The undoubted willingness to buy on the Internet in the future expressed 33% of respondents.  42% noted that ‚Äúmost likely‚Äù will become customers of online stores.  And only 2% categorically refused to shop on the Internet - even after a while. <br><br>  Still, lower prices than in regular stores could affect the decision of people to come to the Internet for goods - 41% of respondents identified this attractiveness factor.  Faster delivery of goods and a secure payment system with a guarantee of quality attract 35% of respondents who are not yet experienced in online shopping. <br><br>  Those who have tried the services of online merchants, for the most part - 74% - call time saving the main advantage of this method of shopping.  Most often, such a response was given by residents of Moscow (82%) and respondents with an income level of more than 25,000 rubles (82%).  Also among the advantages of online shopping, users noted the delivery of goods to your home (61%), lower prices compared to regular stores (54%) and the availability of goods that are not in regular stores (49%). </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/4481/">https://habr.com/ru/post/4481/</a></p>
