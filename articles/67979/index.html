  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Top 5 regional portals</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Since I myself am doing a regional project, which I will probably talk about in one of the posts, I was interested in how developed regional portals are in the vastness of our vast country. <br><br>  Having opened the section ‚Äú <a href="http://www.liveinternet.ru/rating/ru/regions/">Cities and Regions</a> ‚Äù in the LiveInternet`a catalog, selected projects made in the regions and focused mainly on a regional audience, having made such a <strong>TOP-5 regional portals</strong> . <br><br>  <strong>1)</strong> <a href="http://www.e1.ru/"><strong>E1.RU</strong></a> (Ekaterinburg, domain registration date: 02.22.2000).

    <img title="e1" src="http://jangl.name/wp-content/uploads/2009/08/e1.jpg" width="490" height="306"><br><br>  With a decent margin from the rest, our Ekaterinburg Portal takes the first place, to which I am extremely happy ... Or not happy (?) ... The portal is really big and really very functional and useful, despite that mess of blocks, and the structure as a whole.  It is worth noting the fact that, in my opinion, at least half of the sales transactions are used.  cars and real estate in the whole city is carried out through e1.ru. <br><br>  <strong>Average daily attendance:</strong> about 160,000 people per day.  There are ups to 200,000 per day - not bad for a regional portal, is it not? <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  <strong>Design.</strong>  It is difficult to call what is there, design.  But to be honest, I have somehow got used to it and can hardly imagine it in a different way.  By the way, in the design of e1 there is a small feature: earlier it had a different design (in bright orange shades), it was changed, but for some reason not in all sections of the site.  We can observe the old design, for example, in the section ‚ÄúCar sales‚Äù. <br><br>  <strong>Advertising.</strong>  She actually hung everything that could be hung.  And it costs very decently.  The most expensive place is a banner on the main page on the right, the size of 240x400.  It will cost you 64,900 rubles a week or 227,150 rubles a month, with a frequency of 50%!  I would have such money :) <br><br>  <strong>2) <a href="http://ngs.ru/">NGS</a></strong> (Novosibirsk, domain registration date: 05.11.1999). <br><br><img title="ngs" src="http://jangl.name/wp-content/uploads/2009/08/ngs.jpg" width="490" height="306"><br><br>  NGS is very similar to our E1: the same services, the same mess of blocks on the main one and the same popularity.  For some reason, it even seemed to me more understandable and more functional.  Although the logo, after all, does not interfere with the update :). <br><br>  <strong>Average daily attendance:</strong> about 120,000 people per day. <br><br>  <strong>Design.</strong>  Frankly, I like more than e1, but the logo doesn‚Äôt give me any peace, I just want to change it.  It is worth noting that all the main sections are located on subdomains and have an individual design and structure - in fact, as separate sites.  For example, the "Real Estate" section. <br><br>  <strong>Advertising.</strong>  On the completion of banners NGS is not inferior.  The most expensive banner is a banner at the top of the screen.  With a 100% rotation, it will cost you 66,000 rubles a week and 198,000 rubles a month, with a rotation of 50%: 33,000 rubles a week and 99,000 rubles a month.  Which is two times less than the E1. <br><br>  <strong>3) <a href="http://farpost.ru/">FarPost</a></strong> (Far East, domain registration date: 04/05/1999) <br><br><img title="farpost" src="http://jangl.name/wp-content/uploads/2009/08/farpost.jpg" width="490" height="306"><br><br>  To my surprise, the third place is the project oriented to the Far East (hello to <a href="http://www.kopernik.name/">Copernicus</a> !).  The main sections are: a bulletin board and a catalog of sites - and all by and large.  By the way, I was also surprised when I learned that the site drom.ru is directly related to the Far East, and in particular to the company that owns FarPost and several other projects. <br><br>  <strong>Average daily attendance:</strong> about 70,000 people per day. <br><br>  <strong>Design.</strong>  In my opinion the most understandable and pleasant design among the top three.  Nothing flashes, the eyes do not run, it is immediately clear where that lies. <br><br>  <strong>Advertising.</strong>  In comparison with the previous two, FarPost is simply not there!  And it costs a penny.  The most expensive banner, the size of 550 √ó 150, will cost ‚Äúonly‚Äù 15,000 rubles per week. <br><br>  <strong>4) <a href="http://www.sibnet.ru/">Sibnet</a></strong> (Siberia, domain registration date: 11/04/1996) <br><br><img title="sibnet" src="http://jangl.name/wp-content/uploads/2009/08/sibnet.jpg" width="490" height="306"><br><br>  The first impression - a holiday maker or an entertainment site - the roofing structure of the site, the roofing design does its job.  The main block contains news, and most of it is non-regional, although the site is focused on Siberia.  Services are basically the same as that of the NGS and E1. <br><br>  <strong>Average daily attendance:</strong> about 45,000 people per day. <br><br>  <strong>Design.</strong>  As I said, something like a vareznik.  It was not very pleasant to see the icons in the style of the end of 2002go.  The sections as well as the NGS own design, as an example, you can see the section "Auto" or "News".  But they are not distinguished by a special design. <br><br>  <strong>Advertising.</strong>  Here Sibnet surpassed both E1 and NGS - a floating banner for such a large project ... to put it mildly, a dubious decision.  With the cost, I honestly got confused.  Here it is stated that the cost of placing "stretch marks" is equal to 20,000 rubles, and at the same time, the CPM package price: 20 rubles per 1000 impressions.  And for what then actually 20 thousand rubles? <br><br>  <strong>5) <a href="http://www.cn.ru/">Electronic City</a></strong> (Novosibirsk, domain registration date: 12/21/1999) <br><br><img title="cn" src="http://jangl.name/wp-content/uploads/2009/08/cn.jpg" width="490" height="306"><br><br>  The second representative of the glorious city of Novosibirsk.  In contrast to the NGS, the electronic city focuses on the "entertainment": games, movies, blogs, forums.  Despite the fact that attendance is many times less than that of the NGS, the impression is exactly the opposite.  Most likely, this is due to the greater activity of the audience. <br><br>  <strong>Average daily attendance:</strong> about 35,000 people per day. <br><br>  <strong>Design.</strong>  Modern, very convenient and understandable, although the font of the logo seems familiar to me :).  Very pleased with the location of the blocks on the main - everything you need is available and noticeable at the first scrolling. <br><br>  <strong>Advertising.</strong>  It is like it on most other projects, but in the case of the Electronic City, for some reason it does not hurt the eyes and does not distract much.  The most expensive banner is a banner on all pages of the site, except the main one, its cost: 39,000 per week and 118,000 per month.  The same stretch on the main page will cost 29,000 per week and 90,000 per month. <br><br>  <strong>Here is such a TOP-5 regional portals.</strong>  In general, until recently, in almost all regions there was a clear monopoly of two, and more often one portal, which was a pioneer in this niche.  But now competitors are starting to appear, which make the ‚Äúmastodons‚Äù a little nervous.  This can also be seen in the example of Novosibirsk, where, as I understand it, the Electronic City began to develop later on the NGS, despite the registration of the domain, and the example of our city, where a promising <a href="http://66.ru/">66.ru</a> portal appeared just a couple of years ago, which is now very active developing and advertising which is hung up "half the city". So you can and even need to compete with monopolists :). <br><br>  <strong>PS</strong> Looking through popular regional projects came across <a href="http://forums.kuban.ru/">this site</a> , its average attendance of ~ 20,000 visitors per day.  From where  And why is there still no competitor? <br><br>  Via <a href="http://jangl.name/">Kroha Jangl</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/67979/">https://habr.com/ru/post/67979/</a></p>
