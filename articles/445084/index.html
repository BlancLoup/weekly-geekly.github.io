You can‚Äôt just answer this question ... <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h2>  General directions </h2><br>  For a start, there are three large ‚Äúniches‚Äù in the systems of the ‚Äúsmart home‚Äù: <br><br><ul><li>  <b>‚ÄúI bought the Livolo relay and now I turn off the lights from the remote control!‚Äù</b> Is a niche of every kind of ‚Äústupid‚Äù control, automatic maintenance of the boiler temperature, automatic ventilation, etc.  This is what all the Clever Houseers frown on, but once we all went through this step.  Some - run and not looking. </li><li>  <b>"BRANDS"</b> - Xiaomi, Rubitek, Siemens and a dozen more companies producing equipment for the smart home ... There are relays from them, there are sensors from them, you can write the interaction logic on their server or their piece of hardware ... until the server crashes , the manufacturer will not release a new version of the base unit, or some other garbage ... They are divided into three subgroups: with a closed API, with an open API and "I don't care, I changed the firmware in it!" ... It‚Äôs better to have 2 and 3, ideally generally with 3 </li><li>  <b>‚ÄúAnd I have my server's <s>benzene ring</s> !‚Äù</b> Is actually an option for the advanced ones.  We are almost independent and can almost do what we want ... </li></ul><br><h2>  Smart devices </h2><br>  Category from the "he is smart, but stupid!" <br><br>  Here I bring all kinds of relays with remote control, "smart" refrigerators, stoves, heaters, air conditioners, etc.  etc.

      Most often, this is something that is ‚Äúsmarter‚Äù than its ‚Äústupid‚Äù ancestor: a refrigerator that freezes itself, maintains a microclimate and waaaaa, a microwave or a stove, which can indicate on the digital display that there is a chicken inside and it should be cooked in this mode ‚Ä¶ Etc.  etc.  - devices are often really useful, but most often the thing is in itself: the refrigerator will keep the regime until you tell it, the boiler will at best be able to pump up new recipes on the bluetooth, the condo will maintain the specified temperature ... <br><br>  Yes, yes, this is all more convenient, do not waste time twice a year on defrosting the refrigerator, which stopped opening, you do not need to change the microwave modes during cooking, do not run and turn off the heater, which decided to arrange Africa here, and protect it from overheating believes that while with him all the rules - you can not mute ... <br><br>  But in practice - from this to the smart home there are more steps! <br><br>  Devices in this category can be divided into three groups: <br><br><ol><li>  The device is a thing completely in itself and it will not be managed from outside.  You can only disable the external relay or see power consumption.  In some cases, yes, and figs with it ... The category includes refrigerators, microwaves, kettles, washers, etc.  etc. </li><li>  In principle, the device can be steered from the outside: ik- or radio remote control.  There are usually kondei and televisions.  Like it is possible to steer, but there is no feedback ... </li><li>  Devices with bidirectional communication - you gave the command, he responded and responded.  They are few, but they are.  Just most often such devices are already in the group of ‚Äúecosystems‚Äù from brands.  There are mostly smart TVs and consoles ... </li></ol><br>  In principle - any of the devices in the future can become part of a smart home, just some will not give all the possible scope ... <br><br><h2>  Brands </h2><br>  It seems like "smart" home, but ... <br><br>  The common misfortune of all brands is that they simply don‚Äôt pull ALL the niches in the smart home. <br>  Some, like Xiaomi, carefully try to become a gag in each barrel, but ... <br>  Yes, yes, from leakage sensors and to robotic vacuum cleaners and smart trashcan, but you will stick the same blocking valve at the inlet using bypass methods, and there‚Äôs no dull temperature or pressure sensor for pipelines ... <br><br><h3>  Full brand </h3><br>  Firms did, tried the system of "smart home" and do not want to share the devices with anyone ... <br>  As a result, often it all comes down to a sad application that can be used to control the house, the base unit for recording millions and a dozen or so sensors ... <br><br>  The system is in itself, completely in itself.  It was possible, to buy at play, but the price level is such that the toad is stifling, and in the future you can‚Äôt expand IT ... <br><br>  To be honest - there are few of them and, to great happiness, they are stupidly dying of hunger, because  people are looking at the openness of the system, including this one I don‚Äôt take ... <br><br><h3>  Turn to me in front ... </h3><br>  Certainly Xiaomi is leading here ... <br><br>  They opened the API, although not all devices open immediately, but usually it concerns new products such as a new base unit from Akara, which was added - but the situation changes quite quickly. <br><br>  I will not list - this is not the point. <br><br>  The basic problem, like all brands, is that everything seems good on sensors and actuators, but it‚Äôs unreal to embed something new and yours there! <br><br><h3>  ‚ÄúTurn to the forest before, back to Ivan and lean a little!‚Äù </h3><br>  (Rock opera based on the Frog Princess, if someone did not recognize the quote) <br><br>  There are mainly devices based on esp8266, 8265, 32, etc., as well as with protocols open to all winds ... <br><br>  There is a piece of hardware, there seems to be some kind of software, it seems there is even access to the API, but 90% stupidly solders the comb and changes it to an open firmware for themselves ... <br><br>  And here we come to the "sweet": as if all the previous points did not consider themselves "smart houses", but in practice they are stupid and trite DEVICES that do some work in a smart house! <br><br><h2>  Server "smart home" </h2><br>  The main thing here is to understand that all projects, if they are alive, have certain disadvantages.  There is no absolute ideal ... <br><br><h3>  "I blinded him from what was" </h3><br>  The category of self-made smart houses from scratch ... Just from scratch, for a loved one, for his piece of iron, something might even be shared on GitHab, but the heroes who repeated it most often do not even have one. <br><br>  The people walk, click their tongues, look at some decisions, but almost never copy 1 to 1 ... <br><br>  Most often, this is trivial because in the modularity of this system, apart from the author, no one understands anything at all, and you simply cannot pull something your 99% down there! <br><br>  As an example - on the move I can only remember the Cluster with its CluNet ... <br><br><h3>  Majordomo </h3><br>  <a href="https://mjdm.ru/">Majordomo project website</a> <br>  Main characteristics: <br>  Development language - PHP <br>  Script Language - PHP and Blockly <br>  The main language of the system is Russian. <br>  The developers are the most important chief of Belarus, the modules and support are from all over the former USSR. <br><br>  <b>Benefits:</b> <br><br><ul><li>  Focused mainly on the former USSR, because  support in Russian. </li><li>  PHP is familiar to many. </li><li>  Many modules focused on services and hardware available in the ex-USSR. </li><li>  There are images under the Raspberry Pi </li><li>  Multiplatformer: Linux-Windows-ARMs </li></ul><br><h3>  disadvantages </h3><br><ul><li>  Installation according to the instructions - does not always give the result, even if you rearranged the system a hundred times before. </li><li>  The image under Malinu has some modules that the author of the image has put before the image has been rolled ... </li><li>  The base for the system is deployed through PHP MyAdmin ... </li><li>  Some modules have not been supported for a long time, some are crookedly written and can drive the processor under 100% load, despite the fact that they seem to receive some information once a hour ... </li><li>  "Protection?  What protection ?!  A smart home should not have access from Ineta! ‚Äù </li></ul><br>  The system has two branches - Master and Alpha, one of which seems to be release version ... <br><br>  Conceptually, the author breaks through the idea of ‚Äã‚Äã‚ÄúSimple devices‚Äù that can interact ... <br>  At the same time, he himself occasionally gets off and his colleagues knock him off, as a result ‚Äúsimple thermometer-hygrometers‚Äù and other thermostats appear ... <br><br>  Overall impression: for beginners, quite well, if not up to date with the English language ... <br><br><h3>  Home assistant </h3><br>  He is the same Assistant, he is the same HA, he is the same HASS.io ... <br><br>  Based on Python, can work in Docker, there is an image under Malin ... <br><br>  To configure, you do not need to be able to write on Python: it is configured using YAML files, and the beast is quite flexible ... <br><br>  Development language - Python <br>  Script Language - YAML <br>  The main language of the system is English. <br><br>  <b>pros</b> <br><br><ul><li>  Just put. </li><li>  From the box, it immediately picks up both the MiHome device and the ESPHome firmware. </li><li>  A fairly flexible setup of logic without programming as such. </li><li>  Multiplatformer: Windows, Lin, ARMs </li></ul><br>  <b>Minuses</b> <br><br><ul><li>  With the documentation strained, especially in Russian. </li><li>  The concept of setup files at the initial stage is slightly annoying. </li><li>  Sharpened by Yandex weather, currency rates and some ‚Äúlocal‚Äù services of the modules are not present, or I haven‚Äôt found them yet ... </li></ul><br>  It seems to have password protection, etc., at least security seems to be provided for ... <br><br>  A huge plus: unlike MQTT and other methods of device interaction with the server, you can associate devices with MULTIPLE servers simultaneously and achieve some kind of duplication, and the system config files allows you to make and restore backups by using a simple copy of the config directory ... <br><br>  Conceptually, it is close to ‚Äúsimple devices‚Äù: there are ‚Äúsensors‚Äù, there is ‚Äúlight‚Äù, there is ‚Äúrelay‚Äù, etc. <br>  There are scripts. <br><br>  There is ‚ÄúAutomation‚Äù - bundles between the reaction to sensors and state changes, and each automation can be trivially ‚Äúturned off‚Äù and it will not work, for example, if the server is currently working as a backup: it knows the status of sensors and relays, but it shouldn‚Äôt do click "to avoid duplication ... <br><br><h3>  Domoticz </h3><br>  Honestly afz on what is written.  Like the Python is mentioned, but there are doubts ... <br>  Scripts on Blockly and LUA. <br>  Language - English, but there are Russian in the settings. <br>  Multiplatformer - Windows, Linux, ARMs ... <br><br>  The concept of panel devices ... <br><br>  Alas, I will not mention the pros and cons: I tried it, but did not like it: I do not like LUA ... <br><br><h3>  Openhab </h3><br>  <a href="https://www.openhab.org/">openhab.org</a> <br><br>  Development language - JAVA <br>  Scripting language - a mixture with Java ... <br>  The main language of the system is English. <br>  Multiplatform ... <br><br>  I once looked at him and decided not to get involved: I know, but somehow there were few instructions, but given the fact that this is already a rather old project that has fans and has survived several rebuilds ... It has a place to be and live ... <br><br>  PS There are a few more, but now I just can‚Äôt remember just like that ... I will add on comments. <br><br>  PPS Paid systems are in "Brands".  Most often, everything is very strong in itself and for a specific iron ... <br><br>  PPPS MQTT is not a smart home, but a trite exchange protocol. <br><br>  PPPPS I will be glad to constructive criticism. <br><br>  ‚ÄúThis is not a smart home!‚Äù - they walk through the forest into their own through stupid caves, in which the switches of the switch knock out the smoke torch. <br><br>  At least we are trying to make our homes more or less comfortable and they are obviously ‚Äúsmarter‚Äù than ordinary ones! <br><br>  And, yes, the house is SMART - how clever is a trained dog compared to a dull lap dog.  He is smart, but not "reasonable"! </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/445084/">https://habr.com/ru/post/445084/</a></p>
