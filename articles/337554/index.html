From a small user to an employee of an IT company</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Hello! <br><br>  My name is Andrey.  I am an employee of one of the IT-companies, and to be more precise, I am QA.  I recently wondered how I came to this.  After scrolling through this period from my life, I wanted to share my story with ‚Äúsociety‚Äù.  Perhaps this will help someone sometime.  Let's get started <br><br>  It all started from the distant 2000s.  At that time computers grew far beyond computer clubs and began to appear in almost every home.  And of course this creation came from me.  As a teenager, my interest began of course with computer games.  I played a lot and for a long time.  But over time, I realized for myself that I wanted to do something on my computer and share it with people, and not stupidly cut myself with people I did not know on the network, earning levels and virtual sums. <a name="habracut"></a>

      The year was 2011.  I decided to create my own website.  I did not know anything in this subject, and even more so, I could not decide on the subject.  HTML, CSS, Javascript, etc.  - All this caused horror and at the same time - a deep desire to learn at least the basics, so as not to be such a tough layman.  Of course, it would be most logical to start with books, gradually translating what was read into what was done, but I was too lazy to read.  As a result, I ran into website designers who promised me my own website without straining and studying the hardware. <br><br>  Then I chose uCoz, for some reason at that time it seemed to me easier to "manage".  In addition to the very idea of ‚Äã‚Äãcreating a site, I wanted to start earning at least some minimal money.  From here the subject of a site was born - earnings on the Internet.  My parents raised me well, so I did not want to cheat for my readers.  I went surfing the internet trying to make money for myself.  I decided to stay cannon fodder and feel all the pain of kidalov.  If I managed to withdraw money, I wrote articles about this or that resource and told people how to earn money on them.  And the scammers went into the furnace. <br><br>  In the process of writing articles in the designer, I slowly began to learn HTML and CSS, but at that time I created them in a visual editor, which caused a lot of extra code in the article.  If I opened the source code, I just came across a dense mass of unreadable content.  In the end, this had to be corrected and combed its ‚Äútext‚Äù, but this is a separate topic. <br><br>  After filling my site with articles, I already more or less swam in HTML and CSS.  I got acquainted with the main tags, changed colors, font, text alignment, size, etc. Having read a lot of negative reviews about my Ucoz, I decided to try other site designers.  As a result, one year later (2012 came) I already visited wordpress, joomla, nethouse, blogspot, shopscript and several other little-known systems that allowed me to quickly rivet sites. <br><br>  The period from my first attempts to create a website and to experience in a large number of CMS took about 2 years.  Lot?  Probably yes, it was possible to manage in 0.5-1 years, but my studies and personal life did not give me much time for my hobby. <br><br>  What happened next?  I got a job in one of the usual gray one-day companies that tried to survive at any price among a heap of their own.  In spite of the fact that my education was far from computer subjects, I, at the call of my heart, besides my profile work, offered my services to my colleagues to create a website.  As a result, I created a website for this company on wordpress and subsequently it entered the TOP-1 on important company requests. <br><br>  I forgot to say: I am a terrible pedant.  This and only this later influenced my choice.  Which one  Whom did I end up being ... As I was ‚Äúturned off‚Äù by my specialty, only a computer and websites gave me joy and even some kind of pride or something.  Based on the paragraph above, I would have to become a workbench.  I began to read various manuals on the Internet for this.  Having made a couple of sites, I decided that I didn‚Äôt want to be a workbench.  It was interesting for me to make websites for myself, but create for others - thank you.  I was so carried out by the customers who wanted it the same day, and on another day, otherwise, I didn‚Äôt have the patience.  On top of that, I only managed to get freelance, but I wanted to get a job in a solid company. <br><br>  Somewhere at the same time, I met one person (a friend of a friend) who worked as a QA-Engineer.  I asked him about the work of QA, what was the point and what it was, what working conditions, etc. He recommended courses of Mikhail Portnov (https://www.portnov.com/ru) to me, which I used.  I did not know if I would like this profession and what would be the result of this training.  But starting to watch the lessons, I was filled with this specialty. <br><br>  For six months I studied on my own in my free time.  Buses, subways, parks, boring lonely evenings - I studied wherever I could.  And in the end, I blinded my resume and went to hunt my first IT job - Junior QA Engineer.  Perhaps it was a sign over, but I found work in the first week of searching.  I was taken by juna for a tenacious startup that needed a routine check of the site by a tester. <br><br>  After a year of work, I decided to move on and began to independently learn Java in one class resource (http://javarush.ru).  Added to this dozens of video lessons found on the Internet, and voila - after a year of additional training I learned automation.  Started with Selenium IDE and ended up with Java + Selenium with its own framework.  I, unfortunately, cannot recommend the Selenium courses, since I taught it from a great number of different sources.  <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/">Stackoverflow.com</a> and <a href="http://automated-testing.info/">automated-testing.info</a> helped a lot.  The only recommendation - in parallel with the training, try to write the code immediately.  Where to write?  I chose Intellij IDEA for this purpose.  I chose it because it was recommended for JavaRush. <br><br>  Now I have been working for QA for almost 5 years and do not regret it.  Not that I'm proud of who I am now.  To be honest, I'm just glad that I found the job that I don‚Äôt want every day and every weekend to relax in front of the TV with a bottle of beer.  I do not turn up from my work.  And I am grateful to all the people who helped me and suggested the right things at the right time. <br><br>  That's all.  I talked about a part of my life‚Äôs journey and showed, as it seems to me, one very important thing: if you look for something concrete and want it badly, then life itself will give it to you.  Yes, I did not know that I would become QA, but I always wanted to work in the IT sphere and did not want to be a programmer.  I'm glad it happened the way it did.  Never give up and do what you love.  So you will always succeed and be happy. <br><br>  PS: if someone needs info on video tutorials or something else - write, maybe I can help. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/337554/">https://habr.com/ru/post/337554/</a></p>
