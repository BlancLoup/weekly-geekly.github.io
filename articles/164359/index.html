We also did not stand aside, and we want to please you: LG is going to join the mobile chipset race to compete more closely with the other South Korean electronic giant. <br><br><img alt="Image #1671192, 34.5 KB" src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/d61/6ea/e2d/d616eae2db40dcf65f5c1dd52f3a250f.jpg" title="Image # 1671192, 34.5 KB"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  The first developments and characteristics promised to show at CES 2013, but some information is available now.  The new processors will be built on the latest ARM architecture of the seventh generation, the cores of the new processors will be the Cortex-A15 and Cortex-A7 cores; performance when it is really needed. <br><br>  Its feature is the use of two types of cores within a single chip at once - A7 and A15, united by a special controller that provides load balancing and automatic connection of powerful A15 cores when it is needed, and completely unnoticed for OS and high-level applications.

    <h4>  Cortex A7 </h4><br>  The new Cortex A7 cores are a simplified version of the Cortex A9, deprived (by analogy with Intel Atom's) of the extraordinary execution of instructions, due to which the wiring and the architecture of the crystal has been greatly simplified, and the power consumption has decreased.  In everyday and non-resource-intensive operations (work with the OS, work in the background, low-demanding applications such as messengers and social network clients), performance degradation on the background of A9 will not be noticeable due to an increase in the clock frequency and undemanding of such programs to computing resources.  In addition, A7 received a built-in (and not optional, as it was on the A8 and A9 architectures) unit for performing multimedia instructions and operations with a floating-point NEON.  The conveyor remained eight-speed. <br><br><img alt="Image #1671210, 17.3 KB" src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/56d/4ac/48b/56d4ac48b34f2b9867791a219533de60.jpg" title="Image # 1671210, 17.3 KB"><br><br><img alt="Image #1671228, 66.5 KB" src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/d01/262/2a4/d012622a4f80089fce7a82bf4c220f2d.jpg" title="Image # 1671228, 66.5 KB"><br><br><h4>  Cortex A15 </h4><br>  Cortex A15 is a new and high-performance solution, which is a further ideological development of the A9 architecture in the area of ‚Äã‚Äãcomputing speed.  Three decoders of instructions, 15+ stages of the pipeline, execution of extraordinary instructions, high clock frequency, full support for SMID instructions, floating point operations, NEON - a kind of Core i7 among ‚Äúmobile‚Äù chips.  About him there is an excellent material on Habr√©, read at your leisure. <br><br><img alt="Image #1671195, 312.5 KB" src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/a64/bb3/e53/a64bb3e53c31001db1a781a1a8dfe59d.jpg" title="Image # 1671195, 312.5 KB"><br><br><img alt="Image #1671219, 16.8 KB" src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/816/4ea/323/8164ea323f33802c77e28278cb512de1.png" title="Image # 1671219, 16.8 KB"><br><br>  Thus, the new cores used under one heat distribution cover is an attempt to ‚Äúembrace the immense‚Äù by making the processor faster and more economical than the past generation.  The dual-core Cortex A15 solutions show comparable (and sometimes even more) performance than modern A9-core chips, and the A7 cores provide energy efficiency and device operation when the computing resources of the higher-performance part are not required. <br><br><img alt="Image #1671207, 14.7 KB" src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/ed1/2ee/470/ed12ee47004a9af8c8818fd5f8b43e04.jpg" title="Image # 1671207, 14.7 KB"><br><br><h4>  Mali 600 </h4><br>  One of the fastest mobile mobile GPUs at the moment, the Mali 600th series, will be used as a graphics accelerator.  Its quad-core version is already used in the new tablet from Google and provides excellent performance in movies and games on the display with a resolution of 2560x1600 pixels. <br><br><img alt="Image #1671198, 48.6 KB" src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/65b/304/09f/65b30409f7ac2d90a011c7ec96dd9b1d.jpg" title="Image # 1671198, 48.6 KB"><br><br>  Unfortunately, it is not known which version of the graphics accelerator will be used in the ‚Äúsmartphone‚Äù and ‚Äútablet‚Äù versions of the processor, but in the Smart TV version, considering the capabilities of top-end video-processing solutions in 4K2K resolution and the technologies we already have for producing such matrices Most likely, one of the eight-core Mali T6 * 8 chips will be used. <br><br><img alt="Image #1671223, 311.2 KB" src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/b83/fb5/771/b83fb577196e5d0ce4f81b4126718b69.png" title="Image # 1671223, 311.2 KB"><br><br><h4>  Official information </h4><br>  In an official interview given to the Korean media, the company's management noted that the release of its processors will improve the performance of smart phones and Smart TV systems, as well as significantly improve energy efficiency and energy saving indicators in mobile devices. <br><br>  Also, the official representative gave comments on the development and serial production of new generation chips: <br><br>  ‚ÄúWe have assembled a team of more than 900 experts in the field of developing and improving mobile processors who will work on new, powerful and energy-efficient‚Äú fiery motors ‚Äùsmartphones and smart TVs.  The first prototypes are already being tested, but their characteristics are kept secret, as is the date of the start of mass production, which most likely will be placed on TSMC (Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company) facilities, which have technologies for the production of 28 and 20 NM chips. ‚Äù <br><br><h4>  Instead of conclusion </h4><br>  As you can see, progress does not stand still, and we try to keep up.  We hope that next year the flagship (and not only) devices will be released on native microprocessors, and will be able to please the end users (that is, you) with improved performance and autonomy.  Follow our news, we will definitely return to this topic as soon as we have additional information.  All happy New Year and to new meetings on the pages of our blog. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/164359/">https://habr.com/ru/post/164359/</a></p>
