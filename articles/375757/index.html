There are a lot of good decisions among all the devices currently available.  But most of them are united by one common problem - the complexity of installation and configuration.  Moreover, the wider the functionality, the more difficult it is to launch the device into operation. <br><br>  This problem is completely solved in iCam HD.  Our ‚Äútest blonde‚Äù managed to ‚Äúmarry‚Äù the camera with a smartphone in two minutes.  For this you need: <br>  1. Download the application on your smartphone. <br>  2. The application generates a QR code to be shown to the camera. <br>  3. The camera reads a QR code and ...

      ... and everything, the device is ready to work, the picture can be viewed from any place where there is Internet. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h3>  What can iCam HD? </h3><br>  The camera is equipped with a number of sensors and sensors, including a sound and motion sensor.  In addition, there is an infrared illumination so that the camera can be used in the dark, in a room with the lights off. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/5fb/ab3/de9/5fbab3de9bab94e23bfa21756dde951f.jpg"><br><br>  This system is a hybrid of three devices needed at home: it is a security system, a video monitor and a tool for holding teleconferences - the device supports two-way sound transmission, which is not often found in budget solutions. <br><br>  It is worth paying attention to the characteristics of the system: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/c0b/b6b/c18/c0bb6bc1857e6ae24ca0f1cd8974815d.jpg"><br><br>  All data is automatically saved to the Google cloud storage, from where it can be downloaded to your PC / phone at any time. <br><br>  iCam HD is also interesting because when using multiple cameras, the owner can watch streaming video from all cameras at the same time - the software included with the device allows you to do this without problems. <br><br>  And so that no one gets access to your data, the information is encrypted with a 256-bit key. <br><br>  Several possible ways to use the camera: <br><br>  <b>1. Baby Monitor</b> <br><br>  If you are worried that something may happen to the child when he is alone in the room, put up such a camera and everything will be fine. <br><br>  By the way, if you have a regular nanny, such a camera can encourage her to work more efficiently than without supervision.  Well, it is not out of place to sometimes see if a nanny does not offend a child.  Does she deal with him or chat on the phone. <br><br>  <b>2. Means of communication</b> <br><br>  At any given time iCam HD allows you to contact you.  A child, relative or colleague just enough to go to the camera and wave a hand.  All - the owner receives a notification, and you can communicate. <br><br>  For example, a child needs to quickly ask something from their parents.  In this case, the child approaches the camera, she catches the movement, informs parents.  There is a short conversation, the child receives the necessary consultation. <br><br>  The same can be said about older people - in a couple of seconds they can contact their relatives and tell about what happened (if something really happened) or just say hello. <br><br>  The camera can also be used as a webcam - this can be said to be a side function, but why not? <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/f7a/010/33c/f7a01033c54c9b3155cb06ac13dbf15c.gif"><br><br>  <b>3. Animal Watching</b> <br>  Yes, leaving animals alone at home, many owners are worried.  What will your favorite cat do?  Will a playful puppy gnaw a regular shoe for 20 thousand rubles?  You can watch the pet around the clock - and at any time you can contact the animal using the capabilities of the camera's speaker system. <br>  And if the misfortune does happen - prove to the beast who is guilty, using a video surveillance recording.  :) <br><br>  <b>4. Security system</b> <br>  Yes, if someone has entered your house, the camera will immediately fix it.  The slightest extraneous traffic, and you get a notification on your mobile device.  Well, having connected to the video stream, you can immediately understand what is happening at home. <br><br>  As mentioned above, the camera is configured quickly - no difficulties should arise for the user.  Most functions work out of the box.  Only a few advanced features require additional configuration. <br><br>  The process of connecting the camera is shown in detail here: <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/vM1UmvU0EW0%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,1500001,15700021,15700186,15700191,15700248,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhhibtYGtoWJKNxVJQhULSz5PnbZSg" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  <b>How much is this miracle worth?</b> <br>  Today, the price of the camera - 11.990 rubles on the <a href="http://dadget.ru/katalog/dom-i-dacha/oblachnaya-kamera/%3Futm_source%3Dgeektimes.ru%26utm_medium%3Dreferral%26utm_campaign%3DiCam_HD">website of the dadzhet</a> . </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/375757/">https://habr.com/ru/post/375757/</a></p>
