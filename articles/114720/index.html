  <section class="page js-page"><h1>QIWI or what should not be technical support</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/fdb39206/594ca824/04a68151/37b44123.jpg"><br>  1 day of each month is a black day for our company, a small provider.  The subscription fee for the Internet is written off exactly at 12 am with the onset of the new month, so on this day a huge number of calls arrive: ‚ÄúOh, and why do I write instead of the Internet what blocked me because of non-payment?‚Äù And ‚ÄúGive me the director, I will show him who among us does not pay! ‚Äù  We are used to this, but today, March 1, several hundred more calls with complaints were added. <br><br>  We accept payment through the bank and several payment systems, the most popular of which is the well-known QIWI.  The fact that there is no search in their terminals, and our company rarely rises above the 20th page of the list - I will not even speak.  But today - in the QIWI terminals the alphabetic virtual keyboard has been disconnected and only numbers have remained available for entering.  And the logins that we use as customer identifiers are made up of letters and numbers. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  After the second call with a complaint about it from customers (about 10-12 am), we contacted QIWI support and reported this problem, and we heard: ‚ÄúYes, we have such an accident, we will eliminate it within an hour.‚Äù  Unfortunately, the problem has remained and continues until the current moment, even in the evening, calls with complaints continue every 2-3 minutes. <br><br>  At the beginning, we recommended clients: ‚ÄúEnter only the numbers, and then call the phone number indicated in the receipt and ask for the correct login, i.e. add the letters,‚Äù it even worked for a while.  Moreover, a significant part of subscribers thought that this was the way it should be and they only entered the numbers themselves.  But in the evening, support QIWI was tired or changed, and their answers became much more diverse, starting from: ‚ÄúWe have to make a check, after that the money will be credited to your account, but it can take up to 2 days‚Äù and ending: ‚ÄúWe are not authorized to do this ", As well as numerous redirects, and more often - advice:" Contact your provider so that he solves <b>your</b> problem. "

      Until now, we have to deal with subscribers individually, report: ‚ÄúWe can turn on your Internet, but you will need to contact QIWI after 2 days so that they solve the problem with the undelivered payment‚Äù, which doesn‚Äôt please customers. <br><br>  The number of customers who covered the support of our company with foul language is better not to say, several people have already firmly decided to change the provider.  And we - seriously thought about finding an alternative or returning to accepting payments in the office.  And interestingly, this ‚Äúaccident‚Äù touched only us or there are other victims? <br><br>  <b>PS It's been a day.</b>  <b>The problem is not solved, QIWI telephone support at the beginning promised to correct her mistake within an hour, for subsequent calls they only say: "We will call you back."</b>  <b>There was no answer to the letter.</b> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/114720/">https://habr.com/ru/post/114720/</a></p>
