  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Coworking in an Internet cafe: Start</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Monday, eight o'clock in the morning, got the edge of the alarm clock.  It's time to get up and go to work, despite the strong desire to sleep for another half hour.  So begins the day at most office workers. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/660d5731/d3905c3b/18d4b1b6/0929606a.jpg"><br><br>  However, sooner or later, many of us understand that the world is limited by a single work.  And the search begins for options.  The most stubborn and courageous immediately go to the remote work from home.  However, it often happens that an abrupt change in the working mode does not benefit.  In such cases, laziness gradually overrides the desire to work, personal efficiency drops, and the new freelance freelancer spends the extra free time spending senseless surfing the Internet and watching TV.  Soon the man realizes that office work was not so disgusting.

Someone does not have enough of it and a person constantly postpones important matters for later for the sake of rest and entertainment.  The office in this case serves as a kind of catalyst that stimulates willpower and forces us to renounce personal temptations at least for an eight-hour working day.  But what to do if the work in the office is sick of hell, and at home it is impossible to get together and start making money productively? <br><br>  <b>The answer suggests itself - this is coworking.</b> <br><br><blockquote>  <i>Co-working (co-working, co-working) is a work model, which consists in the fact that instead of working at home, people (often freelancers) rent a common room, remaining independent and free, but not experiencing a lack of communication , working together, sharing ideas and helping each other.</i> </blockquote>  (c) Wikipedia <br><br>  I would slightly change this definition by adding the idea that I described in two paragraphs above: <br><br><blockquote>  <i>Co-working (co-working, collaborating) is a work model, which consists in the fact that instead of working at home, people (often freelancers) rent a common room, remaining independent and free, but tuned to the working mode, and are in a working atmosphere to stimulate their willpower.</i> </blockquote><br><br>  And it would seem, so we found a magic pill and a middle ground at the same time.  But not everything is so simple, because <a href="http://www.bn.ru/articles/2010/05/11/62186.html">co-</a> working <a href="http://www.bn.ru/articles/2010/05/11/62186.html">centers are quite small</a> , and the rates for renting a workplace are mostly monthly.  Do you know a lot of people who are willing to pay monthly for a workplace instead of working from home, even if not so efficiently?  Do you know many of those who left the office, immediately went to coworking?  I admit honestly, personally, I know only a couple of such people. <br><br>  In general, co-working centers are not in the best position right now, mainly because the Russian mentality still cannot get used to the fact that it is customary to pay for any services with money.  And of course, it saddens the fact that the cohort of freelancers and entrepreneurs is extremely small in comparison with the same office workers. <br><br>  It is financially difficult and unprofitable for both the tenant and the landlord to open coworking on the basis of leased office space, to start a business from scratch, to buy office equipment and computers. <br><br>  Having a little thought over it, it was decided to open a coworking center on the basis of an already working <b>Internet cafe</b> .  The main criteria for selection were: <br><br><ul><li>  complete infrastructure </li><li>  availability of a cafe where you can have lunch at the height of the working day </li><li>  availability of computers by default </li><li>  proximity to the metro or city center </li><li>  convenience jobs </li><li>  Wi-Fi by default </li><li>  standard amenities </li><li>  working atmosphere </li></ul><br><br>  The best and in fact the only candidate for this role turned out to be the cafe " <b><a href="http://5.3ghz.ru/">5.3 GHz</a></b> " <i>(I wonder how long the name will still be relevant?)</i> , Located in the center of St. Petersburg on Nevsky Prospect, 11. It is noteworthy that it does not smell like the usual "computer club".  The position of the cafe team is in favor of regular gaming events, corporate trainings and educational seminars.  So the basic requirements that coworking must meet, " <b>5.3 GHz</b> " fully satisfies. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/cdf07145/f7530089/bfb3df26/ea36e061.jpg"><br><br>  However, the working environment was necessary to adapt to the concept of Internet cafes.  If we give an example of a subjective list of advantages and disadvantages of a standard coworking center, then here they are: <br><br>  <b>Minuses:</b> <br><ul><li>  monthly payment of the workplace </li><li>  not all bonuses are available for a standard fee (for example, the presence of a computer, printer) </li><li>  the price tag on the rental space will suit not all </li><li>  lack of control over the work process from the outside </li></ul><br>  <b>Pros:</b> <br><ul><li>  working atmosphere </li><li>  availability of a meeting room </li><li>  your workplace or office </li><li>  opportunity to sit in the office seven days a week </li></ul><br>  The advantages are obvious, but it was decided to negate the disadvantages.  And I would also like to argue them from my point of view. <br><br>  As a person with experience as a freelancer, I don‚Äôt quite understand why I need to pay for a separate meeting room, if I can solve most of the tasks in instant messengers or <b>Skype</b> without face-to-face meetings. <br>  So the cost of renting a negotiation room, we simply excluded from the price list for the rental of a workplace.  Well, if there is a strong need for a meeting, the spacious hall will be at your service. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/ce1d1ece/e8d813db/dcb3979b/2781e229.jpg"><br><br>  Also raises the question of monthly rentals.  Perhaps it will seem extremely convenient to someone, but I support the idea that a person could choose the time for which to rent a workplace.  I think that it may be especially important for those who have just left the office and want to try their hand at freelancing, but do not want to change their habits and regime so dramatically, or do not have the opportunity to work at home all the time.  Therefore, it was decided to introduce both hourly pay (which is standard for Internet cafes) and flexible co-working packages for a week or a month. <br><br>  And of course, new freelancers need help to maintain their willpower.  As the roughest example: control or blocking <b><s>Vkontakte</s></b> distracting from outside sites.  In Internet cafes, administrators can choose different sessions on computers that differ in a set of rights.  For example, the client may ask to restrict access to browsers, but leave the opportunity to run local programs.  Or exclude the possibility of launching computer games during a working session.  It turns out a kind of motivator, but completely voluntary. <br><br>  Of course, it is too early to say that this approach to organizing coworking will fully pay for itself and be beneficial to both parties, but the first clients are already catching up and are satisfied with their productive work. <br><br>  In the future, I would like to keep you abreast of events taking place in our newly-made co-working center.  And now I will be happy to answer any questions and heed your wishes. <br><habracut></habracut></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/132257/">https://habr.com/ru/post/132257/</a></p>
