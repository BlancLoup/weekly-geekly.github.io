      But with your permission, I will continue. <br><br>  So, today, once again, in the late and dreary spring evening more like a winter evening (04/23/2015) I was returning home by train.  In order not to fall out of reality, I read a couple of articles on Habr√©, looked at new topics on the <a href="http://discuss.cocos2d-x.org/">coconut</a> forum, and then started reading political news, but this time the battery of my jolla could not stand it. <br><br>  The phone, blinking foully several times with a green bar at the top of the screen, issued a nasty squeak and turned off.  I was left alone with myself.  But now, at this very time, I saw and heard what was happening around me.  A few minutes later, two young guys entered the half-empty suburban electric train.  I saw their reflections in the glass openings of the vestibule sliding doors.  On the third or fourth word, I began to listen to the monologue of one of the speakers.  I was hooked that they came to Moscow from Volgograd, just as I did. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/061/cbc/086/061cbc086c6d4aa3a7b624ff50ee77d3.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  They were told that they had come for the sake of their favorite activity ‚Äî composing and performing their poems.  This proposal made me think again about the creativity of programmers and try to express my thoughts.  So, I will turn, finally, to the main part. <br><br>  Every time, seeing people playing various musical instruments in the subway or in electric carriages, the thought comes to mind: "Here they are creative people, they can easily earn on what they like most."  Perhaps at work they have to perform a range of tasks completely unrelated to music, but while playing, some get great pleasure from their work, give joy to passersby and get a certain amount of money for it. <br><br>  Almost always the thought comes to my mind: ‚ÄúProgrammers are creative people, right?‚Äù <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/476/b8b/bf8/476b8bbf8ff0479c849506e0ab0f91c4.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  It seems to me that most of us who create something by writing code consider themselves to be a creative person. <br><br>  Further, my imagination is trying to draw in my head an image of an IT specialist sitting in transition with a laptop in hand, intensively pressing the keys with his fingers, creating some kind of program or library.  The laptop is connected to a large panel where its code is visible.  Next to him is a guy who looks into his laptop, with burning eyes, seeing what a cool code our hero makes. <br><br>  Nearby, a girl with a flash drive around her neck is holding a jar from under a DVD and asks passers-by to file a programmer for the development of his project.  Several people paused, carefully reviewing the code on the screen.  One of them is drunk, says to the programmer: ‚ÄúAnd I wrote the code for sorting arrays using the bubble method‚Äù.  And when he sees the code appearing on the screen, he covers the left eye with pleasure and says: ‚ÄúKrasava, you perform very cool, you would not be in the transition to code!‚Äù. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/9f6/d54/c38/9f6d54c38a9e4c4297d5429bca13105f.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Every time I find myself thinking that this is utter nonsense.  Is not it? <br><br>  I am trying to draw a parallel to the programmer with other creative professions, but for some reason I fail.  Perhaps for examples I use the wrong profession.  But each time a shadow of doubt that the programmer is a creative profession / personality is becoming more and more.  My doubts are intensified by the continuous work on our game project, a truly creative person from my point of view - an artist and a musician with a capital ‚ÄúA‚Äù. <br>  And if in our project I was engaged exclusively in writing code, I would have long ago put an end to myself, as if I were a creative person. <br><br>  So, dear Khabarovsk people, the question continues to torment me.  Is writing code in all its manifestations creative? <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/6d8/dee/97f/6d8dee97f7e74015a2223f8b67cf04c6.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  I more and more come to the conclusion that the programmer is a translator.  Over the past seven decades, humanity has created many nationalities in the face of computers with their own languages.  So that they obediently fulfill the requirements of people, humanity needs translators from the language of people to the language of machines.  This, strictly speaking, is done by all programmers at work or at home.  And the more accurately the translator (programmer) translates the human language into machine language, the better the result is. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/2f0/e44/530/2f0e445304494b30b2bb99d5550f07f6.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Machines are still too stupid to correct translation inaccuracies on their own.  As long as they cannot make their own decisions, they thoughtlessly perform even the most miserable translations that can harm them.  The thought that comparing a programmer and a translator is more accurate than all the rest of my comparisons, makes me sad and sad. <br><br>  I would like to not lose hope that after all we are creative people.  Or is it not? </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/256571/">https://habr.com/ru/post/256571/</a></p>
