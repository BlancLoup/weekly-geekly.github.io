      My first acquaintance with the "Hosting Center" began in July of 2008, then I had to abandon the dedicated server and look for alternatives.  I chose a long and thoroughly.  I stopped at 2 options: Agave or HC.  I disliked agave for mail filters, and my choice fell on HC, as a more popular and, therefore, reliable provider.  As it turned out, nothing ... <br><br>  <b>Update:</b> Habr - power.  Today the support call and offered to transfer the VPS to another server. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  So, July-August of 2008.  Ordered virtual hosting service (Large) and Primary \ Secondary DNS ... <br><br><h2>  Shared hosting </h2><br>  <b>The patient at the time:</b> <br>  Forum IPB (license).  800 unique per day, database ~ 70MB, 30 000 messages. <br><br><h5>  First problems: </h5><br><ul><li>  The RAM limit of the MAIN domain is 128MB, the limit of subdomains is 32MB.  The forum is located at forum.domain.ru and when trying to upload a photo&gt; 2 MB, the user received a white page (as you know, IPB <b>doesn‚Äôt even deal with resizing the image</b> , but simply creates a thumbnail).  When I asked to make a forum, I was answered negatively by the main domain and most interestingly: I received the same answer to the question whether it is possible to order a separate virtual hosting service for a third-level domain.  Well, okay, I wrote a warning on the forum and limited my quotas ... You can live with this ... </li><li>  September 2008  For 48+ hours, my DNS zone fell off, which was located on the NS servers ns1.hc.ru and ns2.hc.ru.  Those support was notified within 2 hours after the crash (thanks to <a href="http://www.unialert.com/">unialert.com</a> ).  The site stopped opening after 6 hours of failure.  As a result - 2 days downtime.  To my question: ‚ÄúIs it possible to register another NS server zone in the DNS, in order to further insure against such problems‚Äù - I received a negative answer again. </li></ul><br><br><h2>  VPS hosting </h2><br>  Since I already, in my opinion, ponastupal on all rakes with virtual hosting, I decided to try transfer to VPS ... There are more places, and there is enough processor time and 1GB RAM and DNS I can keep there ... <br><br>  <b>The patient at the moment:</b> <br>  Forum IPB (license).  1200 unique per day, database ~ 100MB, 50 000 messages.  ubuntu server 8.04, nginx 7.30, php-fpm + eaccelerator, SVN over ssh, Mysql 5.1, search on the forum is implemented through sphinx, statistics is collected by munin. <br><br><h5>  Plant for the production of rake: </h5><br><ul><li>  September 2008  SSH fell off on the 22nd port for a day (which, by the way, cannot be killed with a VPS).  After regaining control over the server, we had to raise another SSH and webmin for everyone ... The problem is not critical, but unpleasant.  SVN lives on the server and was accessed through SSH, the work got one more day :( </li><li>  Mid-October 2008  Problems started with iowait, the disks started to die under load from other VPS ... From September 28, 2008 - October 16, 2008, the server died every day for a couple of hours. <br><br><h4>  October 16th: </h4><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/ed2/246/8a2/ed22468a23ea6549f21f1fef2d385db1.png" alt="image"><br><br>  The support except for: ‚Äúthe server is set for enhanced monitoring‚Äù and ‚ÄúYes, you are right, an overrun of disk resources was fixed on one of the VPS‚Äù said nothing.  I wrote on monitoring @ (support quality service) and VPS was transferred to a new server within 3 days.  <b>3 months of work without glitches.</b>  <b>Hooray!</b> </li><li>  4th January 2009  Holidays and alcohol ended and I wanted to work a little.  But here is a surprise!  At connection attempt to the server the console fell off on a timeout.  Got to look at the charts, waited 3 minutes until finally loaded and almost fell off the chair :) These are the cute charts I have been periodically watching since January 4th. <br><br><h4>  January 18: </h4><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/f6a/82c/33f/f6a82c33fe4010b18a72c34d74aa4d12.png" alt="image"><br><br><h4>  January 11 - 18: </h4><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/a5c/e53/563/a5ce5356304c17d96e887edc0b398736.png" alt="image"></li></ul><br><br>  Now the situation is such that the service is almost impossible to use.  In the evening, the server falls off on the Gateway timeout, and uploading more than 5 files into SVN at once becomes something fictional ... A request for technical support and monitoring was sent on January 4th, and on January 11 monitoring @ asked for some more Patience ... I wrote another letter to them yesterday, but no answer has yet been given. <br><br><h4>  What to do? </h4><br>  I certainly understand that there were holidays.  But gentlemen!  The 18th is already in the yard, good to drink, let's work!  I‚Äôm already tired of fighting technical support, I‚Äôm very disappointed in their VPS ... <br><br><h4>  Alternative </h4><br>  There are not so many options to leave, the offers on the Russian VPS market in general deserve a separate article (64MB of RAM for 100 bucks a month is strong).  Now I look towards foreign dedicated, for example <a href="http://www.serverpronto.com/">ServerPronto</a> .  Has anyone used it? <br><br>  <b>ps Tell me which blog is better to move?</b> <br><br>  <b>Update:</b> Thanks for the karma, moved to Hosting. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/49454/">https://habr.com/ru/post/49454/</a></p>
