During the conversation, he spoke about the ethical context of his act from a personal point of view and from the point of view of society.  In addition, he mentioned an interesting detail about life in Russia.  As it turned out, he had to work much more here than when he was an employee of the American special services.  What exactly Edward does in Russia, for obvious reasons, he did not specify. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Snowden developed the topic a bit, noting also an interesting fact: when he worked in America, he received an ‚Äúextremely large‚Äù amount of money for work, which, he said, did not require special qualifications.  In Russia, this has changed, but still his current work brings him a "tremendous sense of satisfaction." <br><br>  Evaluating his act - revealing the secrets of the NSA - from an ethical point of view, Edward said that he did not consider himself to be either a hero or a traitor.  He had to take this step, knowing that such a declaration would ruin his life, regardless of whether he was right or wrong.  ‚ÄúYou must have a greater desire for justice than the fear of the law,‚Äù says Snowden, adding that he was in the current situation by force of circumstances.  ‚ÄúWe all have our limits to injustice, lack of culture and inhumanity in our daily lives, which we are ready to pay attention to or ignore.  We are ready to hide the eyes of the beggar in the street.  But we all have a limit of strength, after which we must begin to act. "

      In March, Snowden's lawyer, Anatoly Kucherena, <a href="http://geektimes.ru/post/246726/">said</a> that his client would like to go back to the United States, even though the lawsuit, which is likely to await him.  Edward is ready to appear before the court, but only with the condition that this process will be open and society will be able to evaluate his arguments.  A similar case in the American judicial system has already taken place.  In 1971, military analyst Daniel Ellsberg also handed over secret documents about the war in Vietnam to journalists, but later, under public pressure, he was acquitted. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/356748/">https://habr.com/ru/post/356748/</a></p>
