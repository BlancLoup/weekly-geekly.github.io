I decided to raise the question - Is the use of open source software permitted in secondary education institutions? <br><br>  Habratopika was inspired by the sudden appearance of a check from the Ministry of Education in the school where I work. <br><br>  Two representatives who appeared in the morning politely introduced themselves and asked to use them for computers.  Nobody from the school administration objected, because everyone knew about the check in advance.

      Each computer was subjected to a thorough inspection.  The presence of non-licensed software, the possibility of accessing the Internet resources that were not desirable from the point of view of the Ministry of Education, as well as the compliance of the documentation on the <a href="http://shkola.edu.ru/about/base/">system</a> with the computer, were <a href="http://shkola.edu.ru/about/base/">checked</a> . <br><br>  At first everything went quite well, the software ‚Äúfrom the evil one‚Äù was not found by them, it was not possible to look at the erotic content pictures, to find the scheme of the bomb too, only the search engines asked to forbid it, because it was not supposed to. <br>  ‚ÄúWell, if it‚Äôs not allowed, it means we‚Äôll issue it now," I replied, and going by shh to a machine that I‚Äôm distributing to the internet running ubuntu, deftly added five search engines to the black list that came to my mind right away. some unhealthy reflections. <br>  After a minute pause, they asked me: <br>  - What is it? <br>  I was already delighted, I wanted to tell them all the delights of nixsystems, and then what a good administrator I am, but the harsh expressions of their faces hinted that they are not worth it. <br>  ‚ÄúThis is Ubuntu Linux," I replied. <br>  ‚ÄúBut such software was not bundled with the SBPPO,‚Äù they told me, ‚ÄúIt needs to be removed.‚Äù <br>  - Why?  After all, this software with open source code, which is free and free?  - I asked. <br>  - Do you have documents for it?  License for example? <br>  On this, my dispute with the authorities ended, due to how they essentially had nothing to present and I silently went to write from the console ‚Äúrm -rf /‚Äù. <br>  So, the main question that is raised in this article is exactly what documents (and by whom they should be certified) should be present in an educational institution in order for the use of free software to be considered legal? <br><br>  PS <br>  It was not possible to get an answer to this question from representatives of the ministry, they said that it is better to just delete everything. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/51785/">https://habr.com/ru/post/51785/</a></p>
