  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Biglion - Internet scammers</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Good day! <br><br>  I would like to complain about internet scam <a href="http://www.biglion.ru/">biglion.ru</a> . <br>  On October 16, 2011, we purchased 2 coupons in the company of Biglion for tennis.  It was clearly stated in the promotion that one person could purchase any number of coupons.  However, the provision of the service on the second coupon turned out to be impossible - it seems to be very unprofitable for the institution, and we decided to return the second coupon - the provision of the service on it was impossible through no fault of ours. <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  Immediately we contacted Biglion and informed us that we ask you to return the money for the second coupon to the bank card with which the payment was made.  This appeal was accepted, they said that a refund can be within 5 to 14 days. 
      <br>
        <script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>
        <ins class="adsbygoogle"
          style="display:block; text-align:center;"
          data-ad-layout="in-article"
          data-ad-format="fluid"
          data-ad-client="ca-pub-6974184241884155"
          data-ad-slot="8945601208"></ins>
        <script>
          (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
        </script>
      <br>
      After 10 days, October 26, we contacted Biglion to find out where the money is.  The operator said that it is necessary to write an application for a refund and this is necessary.  Thus, for 10 days they did nothing with respect to the appeal. <br><br>  On October 28, Biglion sent an e-mail in which he indicated that the application was processed, the money was sent, and the term for crediting it depends on how quickly the beneficiary's bank works.  Please note that the bank in which I hold the card handles the receipt of money day-to-day. <br><br>  To date, no money received.  Calls to the support service of Biglion end with boorish answers, incl.  operator Ruslana, which I would not like to quote here.  Attitude towards the client is as if I wish to receive not my money. <br><br>  Thus, 21 days have passed since the appeal.  In accordance with Art.  23.1 pp. 4 of the Federal Law on Consumer Protection, ‚ÄúThe consumer's requirements for the return of the amount paid for the goods and full compensation for losses shall be satisfied by the seller within ten days from the date of the corresponding claim.‚Äù.  Thus, the current day delay was 10 days.  But I do not know when I will receive this money and whether I will receive it at all. <br><br>  As I understood from the words of Ruslan, the operator of the call center of Biglion (he accidentally let it slip) in the company this violation is everywhere. <br><br>  In connection with the above, I turned to Rospotrebnadzor with the request: <br>  - to conduct an audit in respect of the specified organization, including the quality of the services provided, terms of returning money for the services that it cannot provide and punish the organization in accordance with the Law; <br>  - deal with this situation by imposing a fine on this violation; <br>  - to offer this organization, in accordance with Art.  23 FZ voluntarily compensate our nerves and strength in the amount of 1% of the amount for each day of delay. <br><br>  Let's look at the reaction. <br><br>  I resent.  =) </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/132177/">https://habr.com/ru/post/132177/</a></p>
