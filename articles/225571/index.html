      Over the past two months, we have developed two high-capacity mobile social networks with completely different functionality (Coastr and Symblistic).  The development of the first took 4 weeks, the development of the second took 3 weeks.  This design, and server, and iOS, and Android applications.  At one of the briefings, one of us asked, ‚ÄúIs it possible to develop a full-fledged social network in 48 hours, by our own forces?‚Äù.  Having pondered, having estimated the scope of work and taking into account the strict deadlines, I said, ‚ÄúWhy not?‚Äù. <br><br>  Thus, dear friends, we decided to put together a whole social network in 48 hours as a certain ‚ÄúProof of concept‚Äù.  We want to prove that we can create a working version with modern tools, perhaps even in a short time.  Moreover, each member of the team will broadcast their work on the Internet - you will be able to personally monitor the development progress. <br><br>  <b>Disclaimer</b> : Please do not take this article to heart, take a joke and have fun with this idea.  We are serious guys who decided to fool around a bit, so take a social network in 48 hours.  I know that it will seem incredibly simple to many;  I know that many will ask: "Why all this at all?".  We do not pretend either to the audience or to fame - we simply decided in practice to prove that, using modern technology, it is possible to write a social network in a short time.  Before you put a minus, please share a link to the broadcast of other people who did the same.  Thanks you! <br><br>  Interested please under the cat. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h4>  A few words about Sweater </h4><br>  In the light of recent events, our confidence in privacy in social networks has been considerably shaken.  Everything is there: the FSB, the NSA, the FBI, and the FRG are spying on what tomatoes you want to buy for dinner (regular or cherry varieties).  Enough tolerating this! <br><br>  We set a goal to create an Orthodox version of Twitter and register it in <a href="http://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%2594%25D0%25B6%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B1%25D1%2583%25D1%2582%25D0%25B8">Djibouti</a> .  What for?  So that none of the existing special services could follow your blog.  Yes, yes, I repeat, we will not pass a single "retinue" to the special services!  Viva la resistance! <br><br>  As part of the current hackathon, we plan to implement the iOS and Web versions of the application.  Break through! <br><br><h4>  A few words about the team </h4><br>  All of us are former freelancers with vast experience in a particular field.  Someone is a great designer, someone is a master of web-fu, someone has a black belt for iOS development, someone has eaten a couple of dogs on Android applications, someone is just beautiful and gets money for knowing how to round his eyes in time . <br><br>  The development will be broadcast online by 2 iOS developers, 1 Web developer and 1 superb designer who volunteered to help us - <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/users/mewz/" class="user_link">mewz</a> . <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/8eb/251/091/8eb25109198a2de3cb9a24950caf9321.jpg"><br><br><h4>  A few words about our blog. </h4><br>  Taking this opportunity, a little blog PR blog - because the article in the hub "I am promoting". <br><br>  Everyone needs a number of goals that need to be achieved.  Succumbing to the popular wave of mini-blogs about business, we decided to launch our own blog.  Our goal was to increase the volume of the studio to $ 100,000 / month for the year.  However, it is impossible to dwell on the goal - you need to split it into stages.  What we did! <br><br>  Our blog can be said to be the company's mirror.  Each step, each stage, monthly turns, interesting notes we publish there.  We are waiting for you in our cozy community!  And in the group in VKontakte, we periodically play cash prizes - have time to grab it, habrazhitel! <br><br><h4>  Conclusion and links </h4><br>  Thank you so much for reading the small announcement of our event! <br><br>  We are waiting for you on the broadcast: <a href="http://fun.borodutch.com/stream">fun.borodutch.com/stream</a> <br>  We are waiting for you in the blog: <a href="http://fun.borodutch.com/">fun.borodutch.com</a> <br>  We are waiting for you in contact: <a href="http://vk.com/borodutch">vk.com/borodutch</a> <br><br>  See you soon! <br><br><h4>  Small FAQ </h4><br>  <b>You will not succeed.</b> <br>  Unfortunately, absolutely all team members have at least two social networks in their portfolio.  We have already stumbled upon many pitfalls and know how to get around them.  So yes, collect social.  network for 2 days we can.  At least I'm sure of it. <br>  <b>Why all this?</b>  <b>Can you do something useful?</b> <br>  This hackathon does not commit anyone to anything.  We are not going to create competition for Twitter, we just want to prove that it is possible to assemble a social network in 48 hours.  Yes, and their ability to check. <br>  <b>What use is it to watch your hack ... waka ... jack?</b> <br>  Beginner programmers can learn something interesting for themselves.  And the rest can try their luck in our regular <a href="http://vk.com/topic-72595041_30127293">competition in contact</a> and win 5000 rubles. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/609/de4/c36/609de4c3631c603108e6802ebd226a5a.jpg"></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/225571/">https://habr.com/ru/post/225571/</a></p>
