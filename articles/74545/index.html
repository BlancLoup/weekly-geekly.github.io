  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Making a Google Wave: First Experience</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  After receiving an invite to Google Wave, I immediately began testing this service for possible non-standard applications.  And the farther, the more convinced that the wave is not just a hybrid of mail, forum, ICQ and something else, but a phenomenon comparable to the WWW and web 2.0 itself, capable of generating qualitatively new, non-existent socially -cultural phenomena, and even in a certain sense, synergistically enhance human intelligence, creating its fundamentally new command forms.  That is, it is a kind of near approach to a friendly scenario of technological singularity <i>(now in the comments someone will definitely mention SkyNet :))</i> <br><br>  In order to test, I created my own closed wave and started to keep something like a blog in it, but not linear-chronological, but branching out.  For example, one branch is devoted to testing the wave itself, identifying bugs, ideas for development, while the other departs from some post and contains in-depth thoughts on the topic.  It turns out a special tree structure - ‚Äúhyperblog‚Äù, and yet it can also be connected to gadgets and robots ... In general, it seems that this format has a chance to become the dominant form of content presentation on the network, as usual blogs, and even earlier static sites and documents. <br><br>  However, in order for this tool to fully realize its potential, you must first solve a number of functional problems.

    <a name="habracut"></a>  1. Bugs.  And the most important conceptual bug is the opacity of synchronization.  You press Done and think that the text is saved.  FIGHES!  I lost a whole post so much - an Internet interruption took place and what seemed to be a completed work, in practice turned out to be not fulfilled.  If the developers do not remove this false readiness, there will be a lot of mate and disappointment.  Also annoyed (on average once per post) some minor bugs right while typing.  IMHO, it would be nice to disable its real-time synchronization (especially since the feedback from this, as I wrote above, is not to be seen) - not everyone needs it, but who needs it will turn it on. <br><br>  2. Performance.  Google, of course, has recently seriously accelerated its Chrome (namely, in it I carried out testing), but there is still something to work and work.  If you increase the size of the wave, working with it can turn into hell, however, some unusual interface elements hint that someone is going to do something with it - for example, dynamically load only that portion of the wave that is currently viewed, and release memory from scrolling far up or being far below. <br><br>  3. Commercialization.  If Google turns on the ability to make whole waves and specific functionality paid, it will earn billions and allow users to earn money by creating a business field almost more than contextual advertising.  For example, the author of an e-book can create a paid wave club on its basis, selling the right to view author's updates, additions and comments, and maybe even his own publications.  Thus, the problem of ‚Äúpiracy‚Äù is solved - when a book turns from a static information object into a lively interactive process, ‚Äúcopying‚Äù participation in it is, to put it mildly, complicated. <br><br>  4. Confidentiality.  In order for the wave to become a real step forward and not repeat the fate of the good old e-mail, it should initially provide functionality for embedding anti-spam protection.  A user who wishes to avoid receiving unwanted waves can force the sender to do the following (using a customized plug-in): <br><br>  a) pay a certain amount of money; <br><br>  b) solve a captcha or other intellectual task; <br><br>  c) answer the secret question and so on. <br><br>  It is also necessary to implement a set of powers of the owner / participants / guests of the wave, in order to disable unwanted persons if necessary, and it is desirable to provide different levels of access at the discretion of the moderators. <br><br>  These are the wishes.  As for the pleasant surprises from the existing functionality, it is worth noting the function of the slide show of all the images available in the wave (try to find the right pictures in the mail archive!), As well as folders (tags with tags, but sometimes it is more convenient to just rigidly classify information flows).  In addition, this is the first such popular service since the advent of IE, which is not supported by default by this browser (and not at the whim of developers, but because of the flawed functionality of the Microsoft software). <br><br>  In general, a wave as it evolves has every chance of becoming a service defining the face of an era (2010s) to the same extent as the past decade was marked by blogs and social networks.  And what about the good old e-mail, does it threaten oblivion?  IMHO - hardly.  Television did not replace the radio at one time, although the advantages seemed obvious.  Mail changes the main function - it ceases to be a means of regular communication between people and turns into a tool for episodic human interaction (or rather, its agent) and automated systems (registration on websites, etc.), that is, into a low-level communication tool. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/74545/">https://habr.com/ru/post/74545/</a></p>
