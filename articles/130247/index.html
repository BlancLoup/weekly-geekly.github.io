  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Authorization in online stores - too expensive functionality</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Imagine that you, loading a supermarket trolley, very much hurry to the checkout.  The cashier girl politely asks - do you have a savings card from their store?  There is a card, but ... you forgot it in the car.  In response, you are invited - either to go for a card, or to issue a new one by filling out a questionnaire.  And without this, you will not be selling anything.  Your reaction <br><br>  It is not difficult to predict the reaction, but quite often the developers of online stores create for the buyer a similar situation when they offer him to register or log in when placing an order.  In one form or another, it looks like this <i>(drawn from one well-known site)</i> : <br><br><img src="http://out.nimax.ru/publications/register/nimax_publications_register_1.png" alt="image">
      <br>
        <script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>
        <ins class="adsbygoogle"
          style="display:block; text-align:center;"
          data-ad-layout="in-article"
          data-ad-format="fluid"
          data-ad-client="ca-pub-6974184241884155"

      The intentions are good and understandable - to give the user the opportunity to keep history and track the status of orders, to simplify his future form filling.  As a result, it turns out that at this point there is a loss of customers. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  All the problems lie in the script, when the visitor has already bought something, but does not remember his password.  He is not allowed as an old customer, and a new account for his e-mail is not allowed.  The user goes to recover the password, but not all are returned back. <br><br>  Some visitors may find something interesting on their mail portal or in the mailbox, get distracted and forget to complete the order.  For some, this situation may not be completely clear, and he will need the advice of another person who is not there now.  And someone can come back with a restored password, but the fuse he has already disappeared, and he will not make an impulsive purchase. <br><br>  In support of these arguments, there is already a classic <a href="http://www.uie.com/articles/three_hund_million_button/">article</a> on uie.com with a report on a very similar case in a large online store.  The article does not reveal who exactly was losing up to $ 300,000,000 per year due to the imposition of authorization on visitors.  But there are some interesting figures - there were up to 140,000 password recovery attempts per day, after which only 25% of visitors completed the order. <br><br>  <b>The essence of the proposed solution is very simple - the most opportune moment to ask the buyer for the password ... when he has already completed the order!</b> <br><br>  It might look something like this: <br><br><img src="http://out.nimax.ru/publications/register/nimax_publications_register_2.png" alt="image"><br><br>  If the user has forgotten his password - allow him to immediately enter a new one and activate it later by mail!  And if he misses this step?  He will easily do all the actions later, simply by clicking on the desired link in the letter with the order confirmation. <br><br>  You can go even further and additionally show such orders to the user inside your personal account - after all, he indicated the e-mail.  Maybe someday he will recover the password from the office and, by ticking, will be able to save the necessary lines in the history. <br><br>  <b>And even if he does not do this, it is his choice.</b>  <b>This will have minimal impact on the fact of your deal with him.</b> <br><br>  Regarding the second "good intention" - automatic substitution of previously entered data.  For most online stores it is usually enough form, type: <br><br><img src="http://out.nimax.ru/publications/register/nimax_publications_register_3.png" alt="image"><br><br>  If some visitors do not find the authorization in the page template and re-enter these fields, nothing terrible will happen.  If you still need to know much more about a potential buyer, then you can do something like: <br><br><img src="http://out.nimax.ru/publications/register/nimax_publications_register_4.png" alt="image"><br><br>  In this case, the visitor, having entered the password incorrectly, can immediately decide not to suffer with recovery, but to drive the data again. <br><br>  Summing up, I would like to mention a very relevant statement by Pavel Kolodyazhny (design bureau ‚Äúmake‚Äù): ‚ÄúUsability is a set of measures so that the user never stumbles while carrying you money.‚Äù  In this case, we just put the "steps" to some buyers, and already right before the cashier. <br><br>  PS Like many others, <a href="http://www.nimax.ru/">we</a> also made quite a few online stores with the described problem, but we will correct it and promise to share statistics on the converted projects. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/130247/">https://habr.com/ru/post/130247/</a></p>
