Now even schoolchildren can easily create an app or a cool startup.  The thing is that children are more observant, incredibly intuitive, and often understand that this world needs much better than adults.  So far, we have found and translated a western selection about young geniuses and / or lucky ones.  Maybe you have examples from Russia? <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/625/5dd/615/6255dd615c67d3cd61d92e0c75233f79.jpg"><a name="habracut"></a><br><br><h4>  1. Nick Daloisio (Nick D'Aloisio) </h4><br>  At the age of just 15, Nick created <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/id446909528%3Fmt%3D8%26src%3Daf">Trimit</a> , a great iOS app that cuts web content into short paragraphs for Twitter, Facebook and Tumblr.  The application will also be useful to those who prefer to view a summary of long articles. <br>  According to <i>Fast Company</i> , it took Nick about a month of research to develop an application algorithm, such as those commonly used in multi-million dollar companies and Ph.D. theses.

Thomas Suarez </h4><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/ehDAP1OQ9Zw%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700021,15700186,15700190,15700253,15700259&amp;usg=ALkJrhghZFXGiq1FTPvs1fNRLi6NiS3SaQ" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br>  ‚ÄúA lot of kids these days love to play games, but now they also want to create them,‚Äù said Thomas on TEDTalk in 2011, when he was only 12 years old.  That is exactly what Thomas did by creating his own company called <a href="http://www.carrotcorp.com/CarrotCorp/CarrotCorp.html">CarrotCorp</a> and implementing several iOS applications.  One of them, called <i>Earth Fortune</i> , simply displays the planet in different colors depending on your state.  However, the most successful game from CarrotCorp was the game <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/id404956571%3Fmt%3D8%26src%3Daf">Bustin Jieber</a> , dedicated to Justin Bieber (Justin Bieber) and made in the style of Whac-a-Mole (knock the mole). <br>  It is also worth noting that in 2012, Thomas won the <i>Tribeca Disruptive Innovation Award</i> . <br><br><h4>  3. Aaron Sonson, Satwant Singh and Gregory Paczkowski </h4><br>  With the help of the British educational program <a href="http://appsforgood.org/">Apps for Good</a> , aimed at teaching children how to create mobile, web, and applications for Facebook, teenagers Aaron Sonson, Setvont Singh and Gregory Pachkovski created <a href="http://www.m.scandpf.com/StopSearchMobilePhoneApp.php">Stop &amp; Search</a> .  The application allows young people to evaluate their experience of meeting with the police, as well as to find the necessary information about their rights and the procedure for stopping and searching. <br>  Each of the teenagers was not once stopped and inspected by the police, therefore, as they wrote on their website, their application was created with the hope of achieving justice and transparency in the procedure for stopping and searching. <br><br><h4>  4. Steven Gonzalez Jr. (Steven Gonzalez Jr.) </h4><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/5FS31HWzyVo%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700021,15700186,15700190,15700253,15700259&amp;usg=ALkJrhihQ3GIOISvlQgkqnerS95RNflq2A" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br>  At the age of 12, Stephen was diagnosed with acute myeloblastic leukemia, a rare form of cancer.  Then the doctors rated Stephen‚Äôs chances of living at just 2%.  But he took advantage of this chance and survived, although his immunity weakened so much that it took complete isolation from the outside world for 100 days.  He believes that video games have helped him withstand this difficult test. <br>  Now Gonzalez wants to help others with a peer diagnosis of cancer overcome this difficult illness.  To this end, Stephen developed the <i>Play Against Cancer</i> game in which players destroy cancer cells depicted as green ghosts.  He also created <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/steven-gonzalez/the-survivor-games-creati_b_2690280.html">The Survivor Games</a> , a social network and online community for teenagers with cancer. <br><br><h4>  5. Team 2-the-Res-Q </h4><br>  Stop &amp; Search is not the only innovative idea generated by the educational program <a href="http://appsforgood.org/">Apps for Good</a> .  The 2-the-Res-Q team included 4 girls, aged 14, who created an Android application for anti-bullying called <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details%3Fid%3Dcom.fuerte.resq%26feature%3Dsearch_result">CyberMentors</a> for young people.  The application focuses on building self-esteem and improving the user's personal security.  CyberMentors includes a messenger function that allows you to directly share experiences of a clash with hooliganism. <br>  2-the-Res-Q works with <a href="http://www.fuerteint.com/">Fuerte International</a> , a mobile application manufacturer based in London, to further develop the application.  At the moment it is available on Google Play and on the basis of a <a href="http://www.cybermentors.org.uk/">social Internet platform</a> . <br><br><h4>  6. Daniel Chao </h4><br>  Last year, when Daniel was 10 years old and was in the 5th grade, he invented an application to monitor home reading.  Since Daniel and his classmates had to monthly read a homework calendar to school, his application, <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/iread-monthly/id491234234%3Fmt%3D8">iRead Monthly</a> , allows the user to enter the number of minutes spent reading on a particular day.  At the end of the month, students can send ready-made reading calendars to their teachers. <br>  In an interview with <i>CBS Denver,</i> Chao said that he was proud of his application and was grateful that <i>Apple</i> accepted his application, despite the small age of Daniel. <br><br><h4>  7. Zora Ball </h4><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/24b/ea9/a67/24bea9a67e58305d743ab7d819297d14.jpg"><br>  <a href="http://bcove.me/xp9hgmir"><i>Watch the video with Zora</i></a> <br><br>  At the age of 7, Zora is currently the youngest mobile game developer.  She took part in the <i>University of Pennsylvania's FATE Bootstrap Expo</i> in December 2012, an exhibition originally created for children aged 12 to 16 years.  Zora worked with the programming language Bootstrap.  According to the <a href="http://www.phillytrib.com/cityandregionarticles/item/7418-first-grader-creates-mobile-app-video-game.html">Philadelphia Tribune</a> , the first grader could reconfigure her application as soon as she was asked.  This fact proves that Zora really wrote the whole game herself. <br><br><h4>  8. Lim Ding Wen </h4><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/Eovdro7jOwk%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700021,15700186,15700190,15700253,15700259&amp;usg=ALkJrhjIbnwF5X-eR7Nfk1opp9VvnaOrYQ" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br>  In 2009, when the young programmer from Singapore was only 9 years old, he wrote a drawing application for his younger sister.  The application, called <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/doodle-kids/id302828886%3Fmt%3D8">Doodle Kids</a> , was approved by Apple.  It uses a few simple gestures, imitating how children learn to draw. <br>  Lim is able to develop in 6 programming languages ‚Äã‚Äãand in his years already has several completed projects behind him.  In August 2012, he worked on two new projects, one of which was his first 3D game. <br><br><h4>  9. Zach Marks </h4><br>  When Zak was 11 years old in secret from his parents, he registered on the social networking <i>site Facebook</i> (which has an age limit of 13 years).  Of course, his parents were not thrilled with this act, and he decided to launch his social network, safe and friendly for children, called <a href="http://www.gromsocial.com/">Grom Social</a> . <br>  By December 2012, according to USA Today, about 2,000 unique users visited the Zack site per day, and the approximate number of views reached 6,000. Impressive, especially when you consider that users mainly learned about the network from each other, at that time as marketing was almost not involved. <br>  Grom Social has several different directions, including games, entertainment, health care and sports, as well as counteracting bullying, drugs and smoking.  Zak is now 12 years old and his entire family is involved in the development of Grom Social, which looks promising. <br><br><h4>  10. Santiago Gonzalez (Santiago Gonzalez) </h4><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/XWny9lZ9fM8%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700021,15700186,15700190,15700253,15700259&amp;usg=ALkJrhjC-0xhBYEksxfm0Sk6BjZw12tr4w" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br>  The fourteen-year-old developer has already created about 15 most interesting applications for iOS, from games to educational applications.  For example, <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/super-slide-puzzle/id436842485%3Fmt%3D8">Super Slide Puzzle</a> , allows the user to make a puzzle from any image and collect it alone or play with friends thanks to the built-in voice chat.  The <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/id317018769%3Fmt%3D8">Space - Solar System</a> application shows the user beautiful images of the planets, by clicking on which you can learn a lot about any planet. <br>  And if creating stunning apps at 14 is still not enough to impress you, how about the fact that Gonzalez will be only 16 years old when he graduates from college and only 17 years old when he gets a master's degree in computer science. <br><br>  Impressive, right? </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/172643/">https://habr.com/ru/post/172643/</a></p>
