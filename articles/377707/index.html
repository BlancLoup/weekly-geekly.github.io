      Over 2 years of work, we have accumulated a fairly large customer base throughout Russia, which includes both b2b and b2c customers, and we are ready for a separate section on real-life histories of using <a href="http://top3dshop.ru/kupit-3d-printer/">3D printers</a> and <a href="http://top3dshop.ru/kupit-3d-skaner/">3D scanners</a> in Russia. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  <b>Today we will start with <a href="http://top3dshop.ru/3d-pechat-ob-ektov.html">3D printing</a> :</b> <br><br>  1) <b>The company "Monitoring"</b> <br><br>  Specialization: implementation of integrated work on instrumentation, methodological and metrological support of analytical measurement technologies in various fields of science and production <br><br>  Website: <a href="http://www.ooo-monitoring.ru/">http://www.ooo-monitoring.ru/</a> <br><br>  Monitoring LLC purchased the <a href="http://top3dshop.ru/kupit-3d-printer/picaso-3d-designer.html">Picaso 3D Designer 3D</a> <a href="http://top3dshop.ru/kupit-3d-printer/">printer</a> in December 2014 to print prototype cases for new devices.  As an example, the photographs provided by the company show products created using this 3D printer. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/dcf/79d/66e/dcf79d66e58741bea15db6b60da8b51f.jpg"><br><br>  In the photos from left to right: a housing for a remote sensor, mounting the sensor to the cuvette and mounting mount for the pistons, different versions of the housing to the ‚Äúpocket‚Äù gas analyzer. <br><br>  After three months of confident work with the printer, representatives of the company told us that the <a href="http://top3dshop.ru/3d-pechat-ob-ektov.html">3D printing</a> technology met their expectations: in addition to saving time and money when designing the cases and parts of new products, in some positions the printer replaced traditional machining machines: transitional and mounting boards, fastenings, the whole parts of products now grow on eyes for very short, in comparison with the order "on the side" time. <br><br>  The device not only paid off, but already paid off.  The company is already thinking of purchasing a second printer, since  sometimes you have to wait for the print queue.  There are a lot of ideas and directions in this area, therefore in the near future this area will develop rapidly. <br><br>  2) <b>The company LLC "LED Microsensor NT"</b> <br><br>  Specialization: development and production of optoelectronic devices of the middle infrared range. <br><br>  Website: <a href="http://ru.lmsnt.com/">ru.lmsnt.com</a> <br><br>  A team of scientists and engineers with more than 15 years of experience in the field of research and development of LEDs and LED-matrices works in LLC LED Microsensor NT. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/f02/602/b2b/f02602b2b60845af92e22402518a9130.jpg"><br><br>  LLC "LED Microsensor NT" has a complete technological cycle, necessary for the creation of LEDs and photodiodes - from the initial stage to the output of the final product. <br><br>  Any design activity implies the possibility of quickly implementing the idea from the drawing to the finished layout, and one of the problems that any design engineer faces is the production of product models with different geometry of the elements. <br><br>  Thanks to rapid prototyping right on the desktop, you can quickly make adjustments to the design, which allows you to try all the ideas in action at the location of certain components. <br><br>  The presence of such a powerful tool as a <a href="http://top3dshop.ru/kupit-3d-printer/">3D printer</a> contributes both to increasing the speed of creating new projects and developing the engineering skills of the engineer himself. <br><br>  LLC LED Microsensor NT is the owner of the printer <a href="http://top3dshop.ru/kupit-3d-printer/picaso-3d-designer.html">Picaso 3D Designer for</a> about six months.  According to the employees, one should pay tribute, few of them could have imagined before buying how useful it would be, and sometimes it was necessary. <br>  Despite the relatively low price, the <a href="http://top3dshop.ru/kupit-3d-printer/">printer</a> provides acceptable <a href="http://top3dshop.ru/3d-pechat-ob-ektov.html">print</a> quality and speed. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/320/47f/188/32047f188a594235b0fd3b696aa05637.jpg"></div><br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/c26/0ab/5e0/c260ab5e0aee42b380dad8936dfc2237.jpg"></div><br><br>  As you can see from these two cases, the <a href="http://top3dshop.ru/kupit-3d-printer/">3D printer</a> can be used in almost any production.  It can be both cases, fastenings, and the whole parts of products.  This significantly shortens the cycle between creating a drawing and getting the finished part. <br>  At the end we will give the use of a <a href="http://top3dshop.ru/kupit-3d-printer/">3D printer</a> in a <a href="http://top3dshop.ru/3d-pechat-ob-ektov.html">3D printing</a> studio.  In our vision, such studios can be cost-effective over time in all more or less large cities, such as photo studios and copy centers.  Any person who has an idea or desire to print out his model will be able to contact such a studio and get the finished part.  Undoubtedly, this will contribute to the development of a culture of "meikkerstva" in Russia. <br><br>  3) <b>The 3D Company</b> <br><br>  Website: <a href="http://the3d.ru/">http://the3d.ru/</a> <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/76b/f75/e32/76bf75e32aa645fca298c41146cd1ecd.jpg"></div><br><br>  The 3D is a young company from Ufa focused on services in the field of 3D technologies.  Ruslan, the company's founder, purchased two personal <a href="http://top3dshop.ru/kupit-3d-printer/">3D printers</a> for his business at once.  Initially, the company was engaged in the manufacture of miniature copies of people, but due to the replenishment of 3D equipment, it also began to provide services for the creation of entrance groups and sculptures. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/658/300/099/6583000999f345dfa5f0e5febc2d87ef.jpg"></div><br><br>  The3D company plans to develop further in all areas of <a href="http://top3dshop.ru/3d-pechat-ob-ektov.html">3D printing</a> and <a href="http://top3dshop.ru/3d-skanirovanie.html/">scanning</a> , according to Ruslan, they have a lot of ideas in this regard: ‚ÄúOne of the tasks for us is the creation of entrance groups and sculptural structures.  At the same time, the demonstration of the object to the customer is quite complicated, since the virtual picture does not provide complete perception.  The output was obvious.  Having bought <a href="http://top3dshop.ru/kupit-3d-printer/">3D-printers,</a> we solved this problem.  Today, the client can not only see, but also ‚Äútouch‚Äù the geometry of the future decor.  And this is precisely the feeling that can convince even a sophisticated esthete. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/87d/635/6ed/87d6356ed2cd44bcb3bcf422fa897493.jpg"></div><br><br>  In our vision, such studios can be cost-effective over time in all more or less large cities, such as photo studios and copy centers.  Any person who has an idea or desire to print out his model will be able to contact such a studio and get the finished part. <br><br>  This is all for today's post, but we have accumulated many more stories of using 3D printers. <br>  How to use <a href="http://top3dshop.ru/kupit-3d-printer/">3D printers</a> doctors dentists? <br>  How popular are <a href="http://top3dshop.ru/kupit-3d-printer/jewelery">3D printers among jewelers</a> ? <br>  How are 3D printers used for small batch production? <br><br>  All this you will learn in our next releases.  Stay tuned! </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/377707/">https://habr.com/ru/post/377707/</a></p>
