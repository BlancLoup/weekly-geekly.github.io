  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Estonian Mine Museum</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"> Baltic is not really the sea.  It is a bay consisting of several even smaller bays.  The depths are relatively small, so are the distances.  A good coastal defense battery beats 30-50 kilometers.  Therefore, necha in the Baltic Sea fence battles.  Put down a minefield across, left a 10-kilometer pass at the coast, which is covered with a battery on some desert cape - and sleep well.  The main war in the Baltic is a mine war, so it is not surprising that there is a museum of mines in Tallinn, which you cannot pass by.  It is placed, by the way, in the former powder warehouse of the local castle. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/570/28d/5dd/57028d5dde662c2ad97d1011c88efeab.jpg" width="600" height="400"><br><br>  The museum has created a former Soviet mine officer, an Estonian German by nationality.  The man is wonderful and enthusiastic.  Therefore, if you have time, he will lead you through his powder warehouse for more than one hour.  Although the exhibition fits on some 60-80 square meters.  So, go ahead.  I will try here to retell his excursion.  If anyone needs a pruflink - tse his troubles.  let him look for him. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a>

      <b>Prehistory</b> <br><br>  What is Estonia in the Russian Empire.  This is the main supplier of Germans of noble origin.  Mr. Krusenstern and, it seems, also Bellingshausen - just from here.  Herr Jacobi, who made a great treasure in the Russian minefield, is also from here.  It is completely natural that German engineers needed Estonian workers well trained in the German order for about 600‚Äì700 years of domination. <br><br>  Therefore, in Tallinn, before World War I, not only mines were produced, but also the main mine depots of the Russian fleet.  In 1918 there was a terrible mess.  Here you are both young Estonia and reckless Bolsheviks, and no one needs a white movement.  In this confusion, almost the entire mine arsenal remained in the port of Tallinn.  By the way, in seventy and a few years the story will almost repeat. <br><br>  So, the 18th year the republic is young is going to a rich harvest of Russian mines (round) and catches even more German (oblong) ones - they didn‚Äôt thoroughly feed the first world Baltic.  In total, about 400 minutes were thrown in the port and even more anchor carts for them. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/adb/0ff/99c/adb0ff99c36c36c0abf9d79cd353da32.jpg" width="600" height="400"><br><br>  There are no miners of their own - sailors and officers from Estonia who have been trained in the mine business are scattered throughout the various fleets of the empire.  Cause retirees.  Grandfathers, scratching their head come up with a brilliant move.  At one time, each company had a special anchor trolley for each mine.  The Estonians decided that the whole arsenal should be planted on a standard one, which considerably simplified the task.  The rich arsenal is exchanged for other weapons and is distributed to the Balts neighbors.  So 2 tankettes and rifles were obtained.  The Poles, on the other hand, bartered some of the mines for cavalry spurs.  It was at the very beginning of independence, so that the exchange went on the principle of who has what.  Mines on the spurs - immediately became an anecdote.  Already at the time of NATO, Estonian miners were trained in the United States.  The internship took place in the regiment of the Marine Corps, which was once cavalry and has retained its full dress uniform since horse time.  At parting, all Estonian minerals presented a full set of dress uniform ... with spurs. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/f5f/d58/12e/f5fd5812e197b15e1219b2da409f68e7.jpg" width="600" height="400"><br><br>  By the way, this is a memorial sign to the 20th anniversary of the service of the head of the Estonian pre-war mine service - a nobleman of Lithuanian-Belarusian origin, Mr. Malevich.  In 38, he retired and left for Kaunas - the fate is unknown. <br><br>  <b>Story</b> <br><br>  For the first time mines appeared in the middle of the 19th century.  Then they were electroplated.  That is, the mine was placed in the strait, to it from the station led electrical wire.  At the right moment, the miner closed the contact and the mine exploded.  In Germany, for the first time, a minefield was set up to protect the bay of Kiel.  Hellish cars supplied a young enterprise of Herr Siemens.  Herr Siemens successfully married.  His father-in-law was a scientist and, in fact, came up with a galvanic mine.  Herr Siemens introduced some improvements, adjusted production and broke through the order.  So marriage is a profitable business. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/d8d/8ae/200/d8d8ae20092afa9af49d60f071cae93c.jpg" width="600" height="400"><br>  As an illustration, here is your wife with the first Siemens phone.  For mine batteries, a quality connection was needed :) In the background, the weapon of a miner peeks ‚Äî that same console. <br><br>  And here are the Russian-made electroplating mines.  Russia bought a license from the German and happily riveted them.  "Naked" mines - galvanic.  "Horned" - a new step in the art of mine. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/25d/abb/72b/25dabb72b48997c9abc99f25eec866de.jpg" width="600" height="400"><br><br>  This is the so-called Mina Herzi.  Herzi was a kind of French alchemist.  In experiments on the extraction of gold from lead, he created an easy-to-manufacture electrolyte.  They say that Edison was very grateful to Hertzi for getting a great instrument for experiments to free then.  The miners were grateful for another reason.  In the mine horns is a capsule with electrolyte.  When hitting the ship, the capsule breaks, activates the battery, the electrical circuit closes - an explosion.  That's how it looks about inside. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/926/6fd/06e/9266fd06e42758271317a05e6142c21e.jpg" width="600" height="400"><br><br>  As soon as the mines became an effective weapon, the trawls came up with the opposition.  This is a cable that reaches for a ship and tears a mine from the anchor.  Immediately appeared their answers and the miners - mine defenders.  Here they are.  These are floats, on the anchor cables of which there are cartridges.  In contact with the trawl, they exploded and broke the cable.  In addition to them, there were also original defenders.  Here in the background is a large German.  It‚Äôs just a very heavy mine in which, instead of trotyl, is concrete.  She rescued minefields in the coastal fairways.  Because of the small depths they were trawled by small vessels.  Having collected a couple of such defenders in his trawl, the cutter, at times, simply could not move. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/9d0/2f5/94a/9d02f594af48cc4a2e5e98e570b39064.jpg" width="600" height="400"><br><br>  This beauty, which I did not turn over - a French mine.  intended for the Dutch East Indies - hence the color. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/d48/b2d/3f1/d48b2d3f1d0add352e8683e038b8905c.jpg" width="600" height="400"><br><br>  The next two shots are the formidable Soviet weapon sonar mine M-26.  Exploded almost from screaming. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/42e/463/fd1/42e463fd1a894d347b078d40e0297324.jpg" width="600" height="400"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/9be/2f1/818/9be2f18187e33ddce7c1719285ea7224.jpg" width="600" height="400"><br><br>  Traditional mines with hertz fluids were dangerous in winter setting.  There were cases when they fell overboard they hit the ice and exploded.  In the USSR, a simple and effective fuse was invented, which became the source of cruel mine jokes. <br>  So on the "horn" wears a massive iron cap.  Beneath it is a strong spring.  Here in the picture is only a third of the full size.  At the bottom of the check.  Before staging, the mine is tightly wrapped with an iron cable.  In the cable lock - in the castle of sugar.  Getting into the water, the sugar melts, the lock disperses, the cable pulls the pin, the spring shoots the cast-iron fuse.  He flies with terrible force.  In their time, young officers loved to joke over their comrades: to come to visit and give the child as a horn with a fuse.  At some point, the child or spouse who were not familiar with the intricacies of the mine business tugged at the check ... According to our guide, the consequences were sad for the whole situation of the apartment, and sometimes for the walls. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/ff6/fbf/b95/ff6fbfb95f799802472e5c593b892d63.jpg" width="600" height="400"><br><br>  And here is the founder-keeper himself with dumb Soviet monsters with charges ranging from 300 to 600 kg.  TNT equivalent. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/a24/150/c07/a24150c071808c702b51002ec44b36fe.jpg" width="600" height="400"><br><br>  This is the pride of the Soviet industry.  Hydroacoustic magnetic anti-submarine mine.  The Soviet Union pushed aside its old brothers and taught far from all technologies.  The guide has a lot of history in store about the Socialbrothers, who, seeing this monster, cursed and cursed Soviet military aid.  Cursed military and civil engineers.  The fact is that here the carrying cable is combined with an electric cable and an antenna.  The technology remained for a long time exclusively military and civilian was not transmitted, although it could be useful. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/aae/0a4/ec1/aae0a4ec1dec04037eac0f441b2a4d98.jpg" width="600" height="400"><br><br>  The Baltic is polluted by mines.  Now, in general, everything is cleaned.  But still minesweepers, entering the Baltic Sea, announce combat trawling.  There is a double service, badges and salary.  Nikita Sergeich Khrushchev in 1956 decided to stop counting the trawling in the Baltic as combat.  Although it was cleared of mines almost to the end of the USSR.  Here is a calendar, on which are monuments to Finnish minerals.  One of them we photographed later in Helsinki. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/76e/cde/aa0/76ecdeaa0c0a18aee4e2666fca993f34.jpg" width="600" height="400"><br><br>  All kinds of anti-landing mines.  Striped - educational coloring.  Right green - modern NATO.  Discharge is not subject.  Frankly, I did not understand, whether he had training there, or fighting. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/713/1c2/f34/7131c2f34ab1f36737705223dab385e4.jpg" width="600" height="400"><br><br>  various air mines. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/c4f/534/47d/c4f53447d3e0ac380451ae5565093645.jpg" width="600" height="400"><br><br>  exposition of the first half of the 20th century <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/019/0b0/3a1/0190b03a18ff218a93fb116b3be73977.jpg" width="600" height="400"><br><br>  experimental coloring <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/022/5a4/29a/0225a429a5c3ec44562fc8d5dc23eee6.jpg" width="600" height="400"><br><br>  And this is the Soviet brilliant weapon of attack.  floating airfield  on one of the strategies of the third world.  at the outbreak of hostilities, these mines were to be dumped by the thousands into the English Channel, the North Sea, the Baltic and other lively shipping regions.  they explode from everything - from a direct collision, from the sound of the engine, from the magnetic circuit of the circuit.  Floating at the behest of the waves, such mines could in a few days paralyze any sea traffic.  But there was a ‚Äúfloat‚Äù in them that was blown away after ten days.  Below - pin fuse.  Lying on the ground, such a mine self-destructed.  It was assumed that during these 10 days the Soviet tanks would just go to the English channel - and the sea was already clear. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/965/95a/c08/96595ac083bffbe68332851be3f01821.jpg" width="600" height="400"><br><br>  And this is the thing that brought a lot of trouble to the Swedes.  Hydroacoustic automatic tracking station.  Delivered as a mine, it records any inclinations in the range, whether it is an American aircraft carrier or a submarine.  In the 80th year during the Olympiad such stations were instructed at the entrances to the Gulf of Riga, where the regatta was held.  Storm them tore.  Many caught the Swedes.  Only thanks to the museum of mines did they learn what to do with this hulk and from which side to approach it. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/1ff/56f/cca/1ff56fcca82cd578d71b6508dfea1cee.jpg" width="600" height="400"><br><br>  and here is the museum itself <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/1c4/66e/d8a/1c466ed8ab286bb1922c3e3efe443713.jpg" width="600" height="400"><br><br>  this is all.  somewhere, something I just forgot, I messed up somewhere. <br><br>  DOGS.
