      One of the main things that should be remembered when trying to win a software manager at the third level of an interview is that having this technical education specialist gives him the opportunity to evaluate a candidate at the macro level. <br><br>  It is assumed that if a programmer has passed a technical interview, it means that his degree of training meets the criteria for admission to a vacant position.  And now you need to check with him the availability of basic skills to help <a href="http://blog.mbaconsult.ru/blog/personal/rabotat-ne-bolshe-a-s-umom-kak-kreativnost-uluchshaet-produktivnost/">solve problems</a> . <br><br>  With this in mind, here are a few cheat codes that can be used in preparation for a fight with the software administrator. <br><br><h2>  <font color="#0071c5">Don't just answer the question.</font> </h2><br>  Because of the many subtleties that accompany the job of creating software, a candidate who has only encyclopedic knowledge of codes may not be enough. <br><br>  Real professionals must add value to their knowledge with ingenuity, which can be aimed at a balanced and calm solution of complex problems with the development of a step-by-step action plan. <br><br>  These skills are very difficult to identify.  Therefore, many software managers will ask questions that seem difficult or even absurd only to see the candidate's reaction. <br><br>  One of these questions might be included in the category ‚ÄúHow many pizza boxes were delivered in Manhattan in a year?‚Äù Despite the fact that, at first glance, this sounds meaningless, the best programmers-applicants will grab a pen and paper and start developing a strategy to get at least an approximate answer. <br><br>  For example, you can push off from the fact that Manhattan covers an area of ‚Äã‚Äãabout 23 square miles, and estimate the number of pizzerias per unit area.  And then estimate how many deliveries every institution makes every day, and come at least to a rude conclusion. <br><br>  Such an approach is more successful than simply naming a number or a pose with a glassy look into space.  In fact, you will almost certainly look better than the next candidate who has a lot of experience and a plump resume, but is deprived of the ability to understand the problem in terms of logic.  After all, this will mean that he does not know how <a href="http://blog.mbaconsult.ru/blog/personal/vosem-priemov-podnyatiya-produktivnosti-kotorye-mogut-kazatsya-neveroyatnymi-no-tem-ne-menee-vesma-e/">to think outside the box</a> and successfully copes with the task, only by receiving standard instructions. <br><br><h2>  <font color="#0071c5">Take an interest in the big picture</font> </h2><br>  Similarly, software administrators recognize as the best among applicants those who wish to understand how their technical niche will affect the overall prospects of the company. <br><br>  Therefore, they will look for evidence that you do not just want to do your job, but want to do it in a way that makes life easier for the entire organization and even its customers or clients. <br><br>  One of the strategies that software managers can use for such a check is a request to perform a simple task by drawing a moving figure.  In this case, the average job seeker will simply portray what comes first to his mind.  But the best challenger will begin to clarify the details: ‚ÄúFor which audience ‚Äî male or female ‚Äî is a character required?  What is it made of?  Should he have accessories? ‚Äù <br><br>  Additional questions of this type are excellent for demonstrating to the manager that you belong to the category of people who want to organically fit their work into the overall task of the company, and do not hope to complete all the tasks quickly and go home. <br><br>  The main point is that you have to remember: many questions at the highest levels of an interview may not be what they seem. <br><br><h2>  <font color="#0071c5">Share what keeps you up to date</font> </h2><br>  Given the rapid development of technology, software managers are looking for potential programmers among those who have the makings of a leader in their field and keep up with <a href="http://blog.mbaconsult.ru/blog/karera/pjaterka-naibolee-perspektivnyh-napravlenij-v-sfere-IT/">new trends</a> .  After all, such people will undoubtedly be able to improve their style and skills simultaneously with the development of the entire industry.  Therefore, talking about your regular visits to the Microsoft-based developer network and observing Scott Guthrie‚Äôs activities will make a stronger impression on your interlocutor than telling you about your love of reading blogs in your free time. <br><br>  In addition, even if you do not need to be an expert, for example, in working with the latest version of C #, software managers are still interested in applicants who know new products and discoveries related to the latest and main stages of the industry. <br><br>  In this regard, if you have not used the latest version of this or that technology, take the trouble to find out about the current news to at least seem knowledgeable. <br><br><h2>  <font color="#0071c5">Demonstrate a desire to learn and influence</font> </h2><br>  Average software developers want to find work.  Ideal applicants want a place where they can improve their professional skills, benefit and be noticed. <br><br>  To demonstrate to the manager that you are the perfect applicant, ask questions about what you can learn at work, or how you as a developer can accelerate the transition of an idea to the implementation stage.  This will highlight the features that are very popular: the willingness to constantly grow and develop, as well as the desire to achieve success in the company. <br><br>  You just left the battle with the software manager the winner, ready to complete your quest to get the coveted software developer post after meeting with the last boss - technical director. <br><br>  PS We recommend another article on the topic - <a href="http://blog.mbaconsult.ru/blog/karera/9-neveroyatno-uspeshnykh-lyudey-i-pervaya-rabota-kotoraya-sdelala-ikh-temi-kto-oni-est/">9 incredibly successful people and the first job that made them who they are</a> <br><br>  Translated by Vyacheslav Davidenko, founder of <a href="http://www.mbaconsult.ru/">MBA Consult</a> . </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/305512/">https://habr.com/ru/post/305512/</a></p>
