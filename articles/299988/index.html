Apparently, this is why we are now witnessing an unceasing start-up boom. <br>  The entrepreneurial spirit of the young generation is alive and well, they are ready to work productively and put all of them into their work. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a>  But before you take such a serious step, there are several things that a young businessman should understand.

      <b>1. Are you sure that entrepreneurial life is what suits you?</b> <br><br>  One of the criticisms that I constantly hear from young people who have decided to open a business is that they consider the ‚Äúcentenary‚Äù rules that many employers have cultivated so far to be rather dubious.  For example, the majority wants to work flexibly, be autonomous, be able to not follow a strict dress code and work from home.  Such an approach becomes a headache for managers of the older generation, however, it does not contradict entrepreneurial thinking at all. <br><br>  However, having opened your own business, be prepared for the fact that the first time (which sometimes lasts for years) you will have to work more than usual, sacrificing your personal time, hobbies, friends and many other pleasant things.  Yes, now you will be able to work on a flexible schedule, but you have to invest yourself in a new project, otherwise you will not succeed.  You will constantly struggle to preserve the boundary between work and your personal life, and this border will blur more and more. <br><br>  You will definitely be completely independent and completely independent, as you have long dreamed of, but at the same time, you will have to discipline yourself to meet all the new responsibilities that you will have to take on. <br><br>  <b>2. Will business be able to quench your financial appetites?</b> <br><br>  If regular salary increases and generous benefit packages were what you liked before in wage labor, and these things are important to you and now, then the life of an entrepreneur can be a daunting task for you. <br><br>  Whether or not you succeed depends on many factors: the type of business, how good the idea is, how efficiently you work, and much more.  The time will come and you will develop, you will begin to pay a good salary to the staff, but your personal salary will always depend on how successful you personally are as a businessman. <br><br>  <b>3. Are your "fads" a strong point?</b> <br><br>  Nowadays, young people are often called ‚Äúlazy‚Äù and ‚Äúhelpless‚Äù, accused of weak concentration, their attention constantly jumps from place to place.  This may be so, but one thing that I noticed while working with young colleagues, our franchisees of the Gorodor network of city portals, is that when they are passionate about something, their attention becomes incredibly sharp, concentration on the limit and they do not back down until you reach the goal.  And this is a great feature! <br><br>  Young businessmen are digital natives.  They literally grew up on the Internet, to understand new technologies is easier for them.  This gives a head start to the previous generation, even 30 years ago businessmen could not even dream about tools that you can easily use now.  Remember this. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/299988/">https://habr.com/ru/post/299988/</a></p>
