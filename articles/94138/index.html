I didn‚Äôt have to do any device reviews, but I really liked it, so I decided to tell the public about it. <br>  It is designed to convert solar energy into electrical energy, which accumulates in the built-in lithium-ion battery with a capacity of 1500-2600mA / h. <br>  P1100F requires only the presence of sunlight, and for cloudy days a power adapter is included in the kit, which allows you to charge the built-in battery from the mains at any time of the day. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h4>  PACKAGE </h4><br><h5>  1.

Instruction </h5><br>  Made on one small sheet (half A4, folded vertical - 105x297mm), on which information in English and on the reverse side in Chinese is compactly placed.

    <h5>  3. A set of adapters </h5><br>  With their help, you can connect various devices.  The manual says that it can be a mobile phone, digital camera, mp3 player, mp4 player and other digital products. <br> <a title="adapters" href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/habraeffect/db/fb/dbfbd02384b53a88f413a0896273b060.jpg"></a> <br><br>  I do not know the connectors of all the devices, but among the available ones I found out for sony ericson, nokia of the old sample.  For his old siemens cx-75 and camera pentax s12 did not find suitable adapters.  I would like to believe that they can be obtained at retail in some specialized store, but so far it has not been possible to tackle this issue. <br><br><h5>  4. The main functional component - the panel of collecting solar energy </h5><br>  The main part, of course, is occupied by photocells.  The body is made of high quality, made of thin metal.  The size of the panel 120x73x10mm <br> <a title="front view" href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/habraeffect/86/c3/86c36733010736230f6ac6f4855e5414.jpg"></a> <br> <a title="back view" href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/habraeffect/f5/ee/f5ee8f5879f808c383a5bb34c5d07c18.jpg"></a> <br><br>  To monitor the status there is an indicator, and two connectors for connection: 5V power supply and output - 5.5V.  Output current: 500-800mA. <br>  During the charge of the internal battery, the indicator lights up and lights up green, regardless of the source of charge: the sun, USB or the AC adapter. <br>  When the device was connected and its charge, the display did not react at all, and after the process was completed, it lights up red. <br> <a title="Control Panel" href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/habraeffect/4a/98/4a987fae5f874af0705eae6ba64f5a53.jpg"></a> <br><br>  The declared time of a full charge of the built-in battery from the sun: 10-14 hours.  Approximately these figures correspond to reality and, I think that everything depends on the amount of light falling on the panel.  I used the houses on the windowsill, but the direct sunlight almost did not reach because of the large number of trees. <br><br><h5>  5. Network adapter and USB cable </h5><br>  Most liked the fact that the internal battery can be charged from the network or from the USB port of the computer, and the accumulated charge to use when it is convenient.  If you look at the image of the cable, you can see that, on the one hand, it is USB, and on the other, a mini-USB connector.  mini-USB connects to the input panel for charging, and USB can be connected to a network adapter, or directly to a computer port.  As it turned out, the cable can be used to directly connect my 6300 to a laptop, but it will work only for data transfer - the phone will not charge!  This flexibility is very convenient and allows you to get rid of unnecessary wires and adapters in the bag, and the device itself acts as a buffer for charging many modern devices. <br> <a title="Habraffe.ru" href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/habraeffect/cd/bd/cdbdc4e491741edbc470b8be61f740c9.jpg"></a> <br> <a title="Habraffe.ru" href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/habraeffect/f1/45/f145cd07d0bf473e39731d7fd27bec8d.jpg"></a> <br><br><h4>  Conclusions and results </h4><br>  The charge time of my good old nokia 6300 is 2-3 hours, but I still have to experiment, because the phone is not completely discharged.  I also want to check how the non-use time of the device affects the conservation of charge in the internal battery and supplement the post with information.  Such experiments require a longer period of time and the desire to write an article today, not shelving them, won))) <br><br>  The device does not claim to be 100% replacement of the ‚Äúnative‚Äù charging of the phone due to the fact that the charging process is longer, and also depends on weather conditions.  But he can play an excellent service: <br><ul><li>  <i>on trips</i> </li><li>  <i>lovers of outdoor activities, or just away from civilization,</i> </li><li>  <i>serve as an adapter for charging from a computer in the absence of "native" charge,</i> </li><li>  <i>to help friends who came to visit, because the necessary charger, by all known laws, is often not.</i> </li></ul><br><br>  At the moment I am not using it as actively as I would like, but I plan to buy a case for safe transportation and carry it in a bag from the laptop all the time. <br><br>  I also found the announcement of a charger that uses the power of wind <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/energy/13381/">habrahabr.ru/blogs/energy/13381</a> , but as far as I understood it, it never came to implementation in 3 years. <br><br>  Manufacturer - everyone's favorite China. <br>  Weight - 110 grams. <br>  It was not possible to find out the price of the purchase, because it was a gift, but after a little googling, I came to the conclusion that from $ 10 to $ 50 for this and similar devices.  Of course, any geek can argue, ‚Äúit's made in china, but what about my netbook, using it as a UPS, etc.,‚Äù but the device was not made for this, justifies its cost and performs the functions assigned to it.  Although someone may not be suitable for a number of reasons and conditions that I do not encounter in my life. <br>  <b>The main thing - the impressions were good, friends, thanks for the gift and all with the upcoming weekend.</b> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/94138/">https://habr.com/ru/post/94138/</a></p>
