Like here: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/megamozg/post_images/212/cbb/429/212cbb429c667d5410541b3d153e7570.png" alt="image"><br><br>  <b>This approach is devoid of:</b> <br>  ‚Ä¢ interactivity; <br>  ‚Ä¢ communication with the visitor; <br>  ‚Ä¢ individual approach; <br>  ‚Ä¢ ergonomic use of page space; <br><br>  <a href="http://padiact.com/">Service PadiAct</a> , which is devoted to the review, offers a simple way to optimize the work with the database of subscribers. <br>  The widget will help to create an attractive pop-up subscription form with display settings for different categories of site visitors.

      The service of placing a pop-up window is also available for the mailing services themselves, but this is devoid of meaning without taking into account behavioral factors, which is implemented in PadiAct. <br><br>  The system is based on the targeting criteria: the source of the transition, the time spent on the site, the last visited pages and others.  You just need to specify who should see the form.  Then it remains to monitor the campaign, which is activated using the email client's key API. <br><br>  You can choose one form to show to visitors who are on the site for the first time, another form for regular visitors, or a variety of different forms, chosen depending on which pages the client visited and what actions they took. <br><br>  <b>Form design</b> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/megamozg/post_images/3b7/806/29c/3b780629c0ade9a2550fba945e231ed8.png" alt="image"><br><br>  Of course, you can add as many fields to the form as you need, including fields with your headings. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/megamozg/post_images/036/7a1/965/0367a1965a131078f9505eaeef1c6592.png" alt="image"><br><br>  PadiAct can handle the rest by providing instructions on how to add a form to the site, connect a Google Analytics account and so on. <br><br>  Appearance form settings are made using HTML code, which means unlimited design possibilities.  You can use the standard templates.  Drag-and-drop editor is not. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/megamozg/post_images/ea4/6d9/d91/ea46d9d91192e83d722cb2a00b45493c.png" alt="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/megamozg/post_images/6f5/6a5/057/6f56a5057ec392ff873f6957ed963fa1.png" alt="image"><br><br>  Until the moment when you determine the best display options and select, the design can be carried out A / B testing. <br><br>  <b>Sticky widget</b> <br><br>  The second configuration of the widget.  The word "sticky" (Russian - sticky) perfectly reflects its main difference: it is a static die with a proposal to subscribe, which is placed on all pages of the site: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/megamozg/post_images/b3a/a3c/e01/b3aa3ce0147f9f225f47e0bd26667245.png" alt="image"><br><br>  After clicking on the widget opens the full form of subscription.  There are 4 options for the location of the plate. <br>  The style is set up in the same way: you can use standard styles (there are 3 of them), changing only the text, you can use HTML. <br><br>  <b>Keeping statistics with Google</b> <br><br>  One of the main advantages of PadiAct is the formation of real-time reports.  With the help of Google Analytics, the statistics used in advertising campaigns are reflected in a personal account: the conversion rate from the form, the average time spent on the site, the days with the best and worst indicators. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/megamozg/post_images/a06/15c/d7e/a0615cd7e061df1e59fd34d472d436d8.png" alt="image"><br><br>  By default, every time a site visitor interacts with the PadiAct widget, all the details are sent to the Google Analytics account. <br><br>  All relevant PadiAct reports are always available there: <br><br>  ‚Ä¢ number of visitors who were shown the form (Total Displays); <br>  ‚Ä¢ number of visitors who have subscribed (Subscribed); <br>  ‚Ä¢ number of visitors who closed the form without entering email (Closed). <br><br>  <b>PadiAct effectiveness</b> <br><br>  In an interview with eCommThinkTank.com, founder and CEO of PadiAct Claudiu Murariu explained what he considers the main advantage of a pop up widget. <br><br>  ‚ÄúWhat I really like is that the form opens a dialogue between the visitor and the website, a channel is created for communication with the client.  After receiving the email address, you can continue to communicate for a long time: not only using the form, but then through the mailing, ‚Äùsays Claudiu Murariu. <br><br>  The secret ingredient in the pop up campaign, Claudiu calls targeting: ‚ÄúTargeting is what people do not leave the site as soon as they see a pop up window.  If it appears immediately upon entering the site, most visitors will not even read the message, as it is distracting.  On the other hand, if a subscription is offered without any obvious benefits and advantages, the indicators will also be low. ‚Äù <br><br>  The PadiAct website in the <a href="http://padiact.com/customer-stories">Customer Stories</a> section presents the most effective campaigns. <br><br>  Duplicate one of the cases: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/megamozg/post_images/1f2/089/fae/1f2089faee3024e49d34eb192648bd02.png" alt="image">  " <br><br>  The company managed to increase the percentage of subscriptions by 21 times in less than a month. <br>  Ringer is the largest Swiss media company producing more than 120 newspapers and magazines. <br><br>  They placed the PadiAct form on websites from their portfolio and received a growth in the number of subscriptions by 2100% - from three-digit to five-digit number of subscribers per month. <br><br>  A / B testing allowed us to determine the best targeting parameters and maximize subscription rates. <br><br>  <b>Analogs in Russia</b> <br><br>  In Russia, other pop-up plug-ins are used, both paid and free. <br><br>  <b>Free:</b> <br>  ‚Ä¢ <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/simple-popup-plugin/">Simple Popup Plugin</a> ; <br>  ‚Ä¢ <a href="https://ru.wordpress.org/plugins/wp-super-popup/">WP Super Popup</a> and others. <br><br>  These options allow you to display a subscription form to any page of the site and are easily customized.  There are no ready-made templates for services, you can create them using Dreamweaver or HTML. <br><br>  <b>Paid:</b> <br>  ‚Ä¢ <a href="http://codecanyon.net/item/subscribe-popup/2421232%3Fsso%253FWT.ac%3Dsearch_item%26WT.seg_1%3Dsearch_item%26WT.z_author%3Dichurakov%26ref%3Dleysanrich7%26ref%3Dleysanrich7%26clickthrough_id%3D528349859%26redirect_back%3Dtrue">Subscribe Popup</a> ; <br>  ‚Ä¢ <a href="http://codecanyon.net/item/ninja-popups-for-wordpress/3476479%3Fsso%3FWT.ac%3Dsearch_item%26WT.seg_1%3Dsearch_item%26WT.z_author%3Darscode%26ref%3Dleysanrich7">Ninja Popups for WordPress</a> ; <br>  ‚Ä¢ <a href="http://codecanyon.net/item/multi-events-subscription-pop/2764578%3FWT.seg_1%3Dsearch_item%26WT.z_author%3Dichurakov%26ref%3Dleysanrich7%26sso%253FWT.ac%3Dsearch_item">All-in-One Subscribe Popup</a> . <br><br>  Services with wide functionality and price from $ 8 to $ 16.  All of them, like PadiAct, have an English interface. <br><br>  Paid widgets allow you to make more fine-tuning the display of the form, support work with social networks, have standard design templates.  They have some key differences, so you need to choose a service by comparing specific, necessary criteria.  More details on the functions can be found on the links. <br><br>  <b>Installation</b> <br><br>  Installing and configuring PadiAct occurs in a few clicks.  With the email client, the widget is integrated using the API key.  Among the available mail clients there are also frequently used in Russia.  In general, the site states that you can use any mail service with the ability to bind to the API. <br><br>  &lt;img src = " <img src="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/53215646/Padiact/pad9.png" alt="image">  "alt =" image "/&gt; <br><br>  PadiAct is placed on the site by inserting a java-script. <br><br>  For simple interaction of the service with WordPress sites, a special plugin has been developed.  You just need to download and activate it in the Plugins section. <br><br>  The trial period of using the service is now 30 days.  This time is enough to use Campaign Monitor to see if there is a difference in the number of subscriptions you receive. <br>  In PadiAct, it is considered that it is possible to achieve a conversion of 10% (that is, every 10th person who sees the form makes a subscription).  This is very good, if you take, for example, a large store. <br><br>  The application has a support section with a detailed description of all functions: installation, configuration, statistics, etc., which, however, like the entire interface, is only available in English. <br><br>  The tariff grid is based on the number of subscribers, the service can be used free of charge until their number reaches 50. A / B testing can be performed only after receiving at least 300 subscriptions. <br><br>  &lt;img src = " <img src="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/53215646/Padiact/pad10.png" alt="image">  "alt =" image "/&gt; <br><br>  In short, if you are looking for an easy way to unobtrusively contact customers and get new subscribers, use PadiAct, and keep the subscription bonuses for yourself. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/295516/">https://habr.com/ru/post/295516/</a></p>
