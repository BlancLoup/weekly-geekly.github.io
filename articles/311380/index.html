We continue the <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/company/twins/">cycle of materials</a> about the organization of business web studio in the budget segment.  Today let's talk about the formation of the product.  Let's try to plan the product is not expensive for the client and cost-effective for us. <br><br>  As planned, we will produce four types of sites: an information site, a site with a product / service catalog, an online store and a landing page.  The description of these products I gave earlier, in the material <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/post/309608/">about the business planning studio</a> .  Let's start pricing. <a name="habracut"></a>

    <h3>  Determine the price tag on products </h3><br>  I will now analyze the pricing on an abstract example, but you can step aside, evaluating your own market and competition.  I think the variation is possible plus / minus 30%. <br><br>  The average price tag for a corporate website on the market, following the statistics of CMS Magazine, is 80 thousand rubles.  To be competitive, especially at first, we need to be cheaper than the average market price, at least two.  So we will request 40 thousand for a corporate site.  It is also desirable to reduce the development time.  Let it be 2 times faster too - 20 working days instead of 40. Price and terms are the first due to which you will be able to compete at the start without a normal portfolio and reviews. <br><br>  Take the average market price tag price per hour at 1000 rubles.  We get 40 standard hours to the site.  Well, not completely bad.  Now you need to learn how to work effectively in these hours, showing the result for the client.  Note that demiping, we do not reduce the cost of an hour, but the number of hours per project.  It is not simple.  This is what makes you think.  Think about how to do quality work for less money and time.  We will also tell about this, but a little later. <br><br><h3>  Product planning by constituents </h3><br>  We make a breakdown of all 40 standard hours per participants in the development process.  Depending on the stage at which you are (see the post ‚ÄúPlanning a Team‚Äù), you will have a different team composition (from a small one - a project manager and sales manager, to an extended one with the participation of content managers, designers, etc.).  Let us examine an example of an extended command. <br><br><ul><li>  Project Manager: 8 hours (according to statistics we set at least 20% of the budget) </li><li>  Designer: 8 + 2 hours (for a working day we make a layout based on ready-made solutions + edits) </li><li>  Maker-up: 6 + 2 hours (layout using ready-made solutions + edits) </li><li>  Programmer: 8 + 2 hours (connecting the CMS and setting up the functionality + editing after the test) </li><li>  Tester: 2 + 2 hours (testing before showing to client, testing after laying out) </li></ul><br>  The experienced developers will laugh and say that nothing can be done during these hours.  Do not listen to them.  Ikea collects high-quality, functional furniture much faster.  Why not with sites?  Can. <br><br><h3>  How many developers are needed </h3><br>  From the business plan, we know how many sites we will make, respectively, we can calculate how many people we need.  To do this, you can use a <a href="https://yadi.sk/d/1hJMVVAivukYh">simple sign</a> .  Add your own values ‚Äã‚Äãto it.  At the exit, we get how many people we need for production. <br><br><h3>  Create calculation templates for our products in CRM </h3><br>  CanapeCRM has a handy tool for calculating the cost of solutions.  We create a template (for example, an ‚Äúinformation site‚Äù), add specialists who take part in the development (we actually sell their watches), we put together the component stages and fill them with relevant works.  Each work is estimated in hours.  At the output we get the calculation of the cost of the project.  We will need the rest of the CRM capabilities later.  To begin with, let's create calculation templates.  On their basis, we will continue to create KP for customers, automatically calculate profitability, etc. <br><br>  Read to the end to understand the big picture.  After that, you can proceed to creating cost calculation templates.  We will need them now and in the next stages. <br><br><h3>  Check the profitability of production </h3><br>  Make sure that the underlying commercial value of the hour corresponds to your business.  Simplified scheme is as follows.  In order for the production to be profitable for the studio, it is necessary that the cost price of buying watches is about 3 times less than the commercial value at which we sell.  This is by experience. <br><br>  The cost of an hour can be easily calculated by dividing the average amount of the employee's salary by 140 hours (this is the average monthly fund for the work on the production calendar).  Either the fund of salary of production employees is divided into the fund of their working time.  Suppose the average developer's RFP is 40,000 rubles.  So the cost of an hour is 40,000 / 140 = 285 rubles.  It is seen that the commercial value of the hour laid more or less true (285 * 3 = 855) with a small margin.  The remaining 715 rubles from each hour go to the fund for payment of administrative staff, management team, covering risks and unforeseen expenses, marketing, taxes, office, investment for development and, finally, studio profit. <br><br>  In our experience, after all expenses, the studio's profitability is obtained at the level of 10% (at the start) to 30-50% (for 3-4 years of work with skillful management).  This is confirmed in the business plan. <br><br><h3>  Let's sum up </h3><br>  We determined the prices of products for which we will work in the market, we determined the commercial cost of an hour, made a breakdown of products into components, made up templates for calculating the cost of our products, determined how many people we need.  Now is the time to learn to fit in these hours and go to the desired profitability indicators. <br><br>  In the next article we will talk directly about the development and automation tools. <br><br>  Questions and ideas can be discussed in the comments. <br><br>  Vasily Churanov and <a href="http://www.web-canape.ru/">WebCanape</a> team </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/311380/">https://habr.com/ru/post/311380/</a></p>
