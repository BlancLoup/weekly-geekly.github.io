  <section class="page js-page"><h1>uLogin a year later. Social Authorization Facts</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"><img src="http://www.habrastorage.com/images/spoiler.jpg"><br><br>  At the end of October last year, we released our <a href="http://ulogin.ru/">uLogin</a> project to the Internet, and over the next 12 months, he managed to gain the trust of thousands of webmasters.  Now uLogin use more than 10,000 sites.  Following the results of the last few months, we have analyzed and collected interesting facts about social authorization. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br><h4>  Social Authorization Trends </h4><br>  Take a look at the following chart, which shows the percentage of authorizations for different providers: <br><img src="http://www.habrastorage.com/images/authsbynet.png"><br>  <b>VK leads (46.39%)</b> , then <b>Mail.ru (17.32%)</b> , <b>Odnoklassniki (14.75%)</b> , <b>Facebook</b> ( <b>9.05%</b> is a decent result, considering the difference in MAU with our native networks), <b>Google (5.20%)</b> , <b>Yandex (3.87%)</b> , and closes the seven leaders of <b>Twitter</b> ( <b>1.69%</b> of the total number of authorizations).  The rest of the networks total 0.86% (in descending order of popularity, these are Live ID, Youtube, Steam, LiveJournal, Open ID, Last.FM, LinkedIn, Vimeo, Webmoney, Soundcloud, Flickr).

          (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
        </script>
      <br>
      Current figures are not bad, but how are things going with the dynamics?  That's how: <br><img src="http://www.habrastorage.com/images/authsdzez.png"><br>  <b>VK is steadily and steadily gaining momentum</b> , Mail.ru and Odnoklassniki balance with general traffic back and forth (if you add up their schedules, it turns out to be straightforward), <b>authorization via Google has decreased by 40% over the reviewed period and 30% via Twitter</b> .  It seems that users either increasingly trust our services with regard to authorization, or our foreign services do not grow, despite all the assurances of their marketers. <br><br><h4>  Sotsdem and who is easier to enter through the social network </h4><br>  The collected statistics on socio-demographic data made it clear that there is a wide variation in age with respect to the propensity to social authorization, and that men are more likely to authorize women.  Look at the facts again: <br><img src="http://www.habrastorage.com/images/liruulogin.png"><br>  Statistics of social demo lyre against our statistics in terms of age and gender.  Indicative differences, but with what it can be connected?  Either we choose a somewhat inaccurate lyre, or we have very different factors passing through uLogin along different sections.  The first hypothesis was not confirmed, so we will carry out the analysis in the thesis of the correctness of the social issue of the lira. <br><br>  Initial sex distribution (at the stage of viewing the social authorization widget): <br>  <b>Men - 41.37%</b> , <b>women - 58.63%</b> . <br>  After logging in via social network: <br>  <b>Men - 49.30%</b> , <b>women - 50.70%</b> . <br><br>  It is easy to see that men log in much more often than women (the ratio of male conversions to female conversions will be (49.3 / 41.37) / (50.7 / 58.63) = 1.378).  So, if the conversion of women is taken as 100%, then the <b>conversion of men will be almost 138%</b> .  Solid difference of 38%.  Apparently, the male population is more ‚Äúadvanced‚Äù in terms of technology, and the mechanism of social authorization is perceived by them more naturally.  I wonder if something like this is observed during normal registration (is it more difficult for women to pass it? Does anyone have any similar data?). <br><br>  The ratio for a specific slice (in particular, for men, this will be 49.30 / 41.37 = 1.19) is called a propensity for social entry, and see how it is arranged in the context of ages: <br><img src="http://www.habrastorage.com/images/inclinatio.png"><br>  We see that the figure for men in 1.19 is not particularly prominent.  Users aged 18-24 have this indicator at 1.57.  And for people over 35 it is not typical to log in via social networks, at their age and the percentage of social networks penetration is not so great. <br><br>  We have come to the portrait of the most socially authorized user: <b>this is a man of 18-24 years old</b> , a <s>geek</s> . <br><br><h4>  Results for the year of work </h4><br>  Now we have already exceeded the mark of 18,000,000 views of the widget every day, with 3,500,000 unique visitors. <br>  The graph shows the growth from the start of the service ( <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/130893/">we started at the end of October 2011</a> ). <br><img src="http://www.habrastorage.com/images/growth.png"><br><br>  We have plugins for 27 CMS and we support 18 authorization providers: <br><img src="http://www.habrastorage.com/images/insidewcw.png"><br>  Of the important innovations: https, easyxdm, the ability to insert their own buttons, the acceleration of the service.  Soon there will be new buns. <br><br><h4>  Battle of social authorization and registration </h4><br>  One of our partners provided us with interesting statistics: <br><img src="http://www.habrastorage.com/images/uloginvsol.png"><br><h6>  the graph shows the percentage of conversion of visitors into registered users using regular registration and our widget, by time </h6><br>  The graph clearly shows that uLogin not only overtook quantitatively familiar registration on the portal, but also helped to increase the conversion of visitors to users by more than 2 times.  The victory over the registration is won. <br><br>  In general, the average website with our widget over the past six months, the <b>conversion of visitors into users</b> (the ratio of registrations through social networks to the widget views) <b>increased by 30%</b> . <br>  Users definitely like social authorization. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/159387/">https://habr.com/ru/post/159387/</a></p>
