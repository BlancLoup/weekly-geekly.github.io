      Images have to change depending on the current situation in order to perform their functions in an increasingly heterogeneous environment of the modern Internet.  Imgix was created specifically to solve this problem. <br><br>  The service allows you to dynamically process any images on the Internet and adapt them to current conditions in real time.  Of course, to solve this problem requires a huge stock of power and resources. <br><br>  Experts <a href="http://www.datacenterknowledge.com/archives/2015/04/21/cloud-changed-data-center-architect/">list</a> several reasons that influenced how data centers operate and operate today.  The desire of companies to achieve a more flexible and efficient use of resources actually leads to the emergence of a new profession of ‚Äúarchitects‚Äù - these people manage the infrastructure in order to achieve its greatest efficiency.  When designing and managing data centers, new approaches are used: from DevOps to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_center_infrastructure_management">DCIM</a> . <br><br>  Today, they are increasingly introducing technologies that can provide greater power density while reducing the area occupied by the data center.  So, imgix infrastructure is based on the principles of rapid deployment at the design stage.  Under rapid deployment should be understood the introduction of the basic infrastructure to its actual use, while ensuring sufficient flexibility in making changes in the future. <br><br>  Such an approach to the design of a data center has its own difficulties: initial expenses may be too high, a small mistake may entail negative consequences. <br><br>  Imgix engineers recommend to think over their infrastructure in advance, because [in "combat" conditions] there is not enough time to adapt to changes in traffic.  Cable photo hosting infrastructure built on this principle.  Each cable was laid in advance, and the volumes of the "dark" optical fiber exceed the current needs by three times. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/cce/5a3/640/cce5a364031d40a6b389254881d119d4.jpg"><br>  / <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/jemimus/14916003245/in/photolist-oJ5q6K-bqY7tn-8kYgmL-5JjiDv-4qETvU-8eRC2-2jv36k-kyK36i-fTsy1Q-dtbhzp-KCRFY-5Jozbh-bqY7De-fTsxGJ-kyKuig-dZ5xUX-eZv6r-bVTJea-dZaiRC-cs6chU-aCXAa-pxDgC-nXpUbD-8Vvwh-6tJA47-imfDLH-6tJAa7-avnpd5-6tEsgr-4qFg1h-e4bDb-orAbaH-6tEs88-cs5VUm-5cPSAD-d75EDE-dZ8BAo-4qBcYF-nXpTUB-oDnBit-6tJzZS-dtbdxz-cdg5wd-4Yju89-55VAZm-dtb2AR-EN7RV-bVTJHc-5dtfKN-eSqrCe">photo Atomic Taco</a> <a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/2.0/">CC</a> <br><br>  Companies that manage data centers are trying to increase power density by creating a more compact infrastructure with fewer racks that can hold more servers.  This allows not only to save space and resources that were required for its heating and cooling, but also to get rid of excess infrastructure (wires, raised floors, ventilation, etc.) <br><br>  Instead of the classic busline, engineers provided the ability to use the same power supply connection option for each server cabinet, which allowed to install any cabinet in any place and at any time (with only minor restrictions). <br><br>  By creating the power supply infrastructure in advance, the project team reduced the risks when working with the equipment turned on and reduced the supply of new cabinets to the operation of the circuit breaker. <br><br>  In addition, the supporting structure system plays an important role in the rapid and mobile placement of server cabinets.  Engineers installed custom-made bolt couplings in floor tiles that allow you to securely attach the cabinet to the floor. <br><br>  All rapid deployment solutions allow imgix to install additional servers, if necessary, and deal with everything that interests customers of the service.  The Apple operating system offers many advantages over other platforms, in terms of image processing, and for the same reasons, many designers prefer it.  Some tasks are better solved using Linux systems running on traditional server hardware. <br><br>  The network infrastructure of the data center is logically and physically heterogeneous and has a high degree of reliability.  As in the case of server hardware, a technique was chosen, ready for reuse, in order to minimize the operating costs incurred by a small number of project teams during equipment operation. <br><br>  The development of virtualization technologies has led to the active proliferation of "clouds" - according to Gartner, in 2016 cloud resources will account for a significant portion of the costs of all IT budgets.  And according to Cisco, by 2018, up to 78% of all workloads will be processed by cloud-based data centers.  Goldman Sachs predicts that the cloud infrastructure market by 2018 will grow by more than 19.5% from 2015, reaching $ 43 billion by the deadline. <br><br>  <b><i>PS We try to share not only our own experience on the service of providing virtual infrastructure <b><a href="https://1cloud.ru/">1cloud</a></b> , but also to talk about related areas of knowledge in our <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/1cloud/blog/">blog</a> on Habr√©.</i></b>  <b><i>Do not forget to subscribe to updates, friends!</i></b> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/261089/">https://habr.com/ru/post/261089/</a></p>
