      In our case, <b>moderators</b> are ordinary players who have expressed a desire to help other members of the community.  As a rule, such enthusiasts are well versed in mechanics and can answer questions both for beginners and experienced players.  In addition, the duties of moderators include maintaining order in the community, namely, removing spam, reminding players about the rules of behavior in a group and resolving conflict situations. <br><br>  Let's, in fact, talk about what the antipode of a good moderator should be and how he should behave. <br><br>  <b>1. The most terrible moderator does not know what patience, calm and respect are.</b> <br><br>  In fact, it doesn‚Äôt matter to such a moderator whether a healthy friendly atmosphere reigns in the community, he will calmly ignore the conflicts between the players or, on the contrary, selflessly take part in heated debates without stopping them. <br><br>  <b>Cognitive history 1:</b> Yes, there was a simple player who suddenly became a moderator.  As a result, this moderator player stopped worrying the mundane concerns of mere mortals, moreover, when some ordinary players tried to argue, he simply sent them to the ban. <br><br>  In a community where users do not feel the respect of administrators and moderators, all discussions can turn into endless disassemblies and showdowns. <br><br>  2. Our most terrible moderator is a cocky guy.  <b>He doesn‚Äôt care that reputation is fragile.</b>  That is why he forgot to think that it is important to be polite, tactful and, let's be honest, adequate, not only within the official community, but also outside it. <br><br>  <b>Cognitive history 2:</b> One moderator was a real angel in the official community, and his work was excellent.  But it turned out that the same moderator in unofficial groups behaves just awful - in the strongest terms insults everyone who catches his eye. <br><br>  Authority and respect among the players is hard to earn, but easy to lose due to rash behavior.  Subsequently, this greatly complicates communication within the official community. <br><br>  <b>3. The development of the gaming community is not interested in a bad moderator.</b>  He will not share his tactics and game strategies, and answers questions from players routinely and reluctantly. <br><br>  <b>Cognitive Story 3:</b> One moderator was well versed in the game, but he could not communicate with other players at all.  Only ‚ÄúWrite to tech support‚Äù answered questions.  And very soon it became clear to all those around that this moderator is not at all interested in sharing information with other players, and his place could easily be replaced by a bot answering machine. <br><br>  <b>4. A bad moderator does not accept humor in the gaming community.</b>  The game is a serious thing, so entertainment is not appropriate here. <br><br>  <b>Cognitive history 4:</b> One moderator has always been a responsible and serious person and he approached his duties with all rigor.  After learning all the rules by heart, he deleted all the funny posts from community members, if they only indirectly related to the game.  This moderator sincerely believed that the group did not need all these jokes, and, frankly, the players did not like him for that. <br><br>  <b>5. The most terrible moderator with might and main takes advantage of personal communication with the game developer</b> and solves only his own problems.  At the same time, he does not care about the need to transfer the received information about updates and their benefits to the gaming community.  The most terrible moderator fills up his piggy bank of knowledge and does not share useful information with anyone.  Except when confidential information falls into his hands. <br><br>  <b>Cognitive Story 5:</b> One moderator came to the gaming community, pursuing personal goals.  He wanted to receive information about the changes in the game firsthand, as well as gain special status. <br><br>  He was in no hurry to share information with the community, but, having learned the details of the upcoming update, he could not restrain himself and told everything to his friend.  Rumors spread quickly and caused a lot of discussion and conflict situations. <br><br>  And this is just a small list of qualities that you can meet at the potential most terrible moderator.  It is up to you to decide with which people you want to cooperate to develop the gaming community and how you need to build work.  Of course, the official groups are developing not only due to the work of the moderators, but the right choice of the team and constant communication with it can be of great importance for the entire community. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/395741/">https://habr.com/ru/post/395741/</a></p>
