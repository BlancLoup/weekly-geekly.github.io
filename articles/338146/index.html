Therefore, we do not get tired of experimenting with new formats of events to achieve higher goals (Cool sounds, right?).  At first we abandoned the usual DevCon conference and switched to the DevCon School format: industry experts and their real experience in real projects.  During the experiment, we conducted 6 schools and realized that this format allows us to ‚Äútouch‚Äù new technologies, get a general idea about them, get back into working routine with the usual lack of time and stop. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/fe2/4b7/e5d/fe24b7e5d3d947c5adf66c631dfc73a2.jpg"><br><br>  Today I want to tell you about the next step - OpenHack, which will allow to conduct an experiment together with experts and test the working hypothesis in the case. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  <b>OpenHack is:</b>

    <ul><li>  no more than 10-12 teams of 2-4 people; </li><li>  3 days for coding, scripting and other joys; </li><li>  Microsoft experts and new technologies; </li><li>  market experts and the actual use of these new technologies. </li></ul><br>  <b>The goal of OpenHack</b> is to work on solving a real problem or a pilot task of a company, using new technologies with the support of experts.  This time we have chosen three directions for each of which we are waiting for 10-12 teams: <br><br><ul><li>  containers, orchestration, and CaaS in the Azure cloud; </li><li>  Building DevOps solutions and processes based on open source products in the Azure cloud; </li><li>  work with big data in the Azure cloud. </li></ul><br>  <b>Why containers and orchestration?</b>  The use of containers in enterprise information systems has ceased to be surprising and even has become a trend.  Most often, serious decisions are not complete without the use of orchestration of containers in one form or another.  Also, cloud-based CaaS solutions (Container-as-a-Service) have become much wider and allow dynamically adding capacity to the existing infrastructure.  Azure Cloud provides developers and DevOps engineers with a platform for creating hybrid and cloud production scenarios, as well as development and testing scenarios.  However, in order to implement them even in the basic version, it is necessary to understand a large number of terminology, new technologies and approaches. <br><br>  In this school, we offer you to work through all the issues that you may have when starting to work with containers, orchestrators and container services, as well as discuss and solve your actual problem or go through specially prepared laboratory works. <br><br>  <b>Machine learning and neural networks</b> are not the first year in the technological trend.  An important part of machine learning tasks is not only the training itself, but also the preparation and preliminary processing of large data arrays.  Today, almost every company has such tasks, so the logical solution is to bring this process to the cloud. <br><br>  Within 5 days we together with you will build a prototype solution for the preparation and analysis of big data of your company. <br><br>  <b>Consider building solutions and processes DevOps.</b>  Despite the growing popularity of using cloud solutions, many are stopped by vendor lock - the use of technologies from a specific manufacturer and the impossibility of further migration.  Microsoft builds an Azure cloud so that you can choose the product or tool that you find most appropriate for your solution.  Examples of this are the recent release of MySQL and Postgres SaaS services, as well as many years of support for a wide range of Linux distributions, including commercially supported ones. <br><br>  At the event, we will look at, get to know, and in practice, deploy several popular use cases for Linux, MySQL, Postgres, and other open source products in the Azure cloud.  Come to us with your script, and we will implement its pilot version together. <br><br>  So, we are waiting for <b>September 26 - 30,</b> teams of <b>2 to 4 people</b> from one organization, <b>3 streams / directions</b> , participation and goodies <b>for free</b> , you need to register the whole team by <a href="https://events.techdays.ru/Microsoft-Developer-School/2017-09/">reference</a> . <br><br>  <b>Waiting for you at Microsoft OpenHack aka Microsoft Developer School!</b>  If you have any questions, write in the comments. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/338146/">https://habr.com/ru/post/338146/</a></p>
