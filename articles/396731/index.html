Here both the appearance of new drivers and the accumulation of a common fleet play a role.  Unfortunately, architects and town planners of the Soviet era couldn‚Äôt even think that a three-lane road in the city center in fifty years could turn into an ‚Äúeye of a needle‚Äù along which traffic would drag at an average speed of 5‚Äì15 km / h. do not fly by passing an air wave past people passing by.  The situation in the courtyards is even sadder: the majority of residential buildings in the CIS countries were designed according to Soviet standards for parking, that is, on average, this is one parking space for several apartments. <br><br>  The problem of parking, traffic violations and driving on the sidewalks is particularly acute for large Russian cities.  Many drivers behave so aggressively that they not only create problems for pedestrians, parking on the sidewalks or destroying the green zone in the courtyards of houses, but also simply pose a danger to city residents.

      Previously, video or photographing of the violation could not be unambiguous evidence of the driver‚Äôs guilt, and the bureaucratic procedures for the proceedings upon receipt of the materials and the application from the citizen could take much longer than the two months provided for by the law for the proceedings.  Now the traffic police proposes to release a special application for popular mobile platforms, photos and videos from which could be sufficient grounds for issuing a fine to the violator. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Some publications that <a href="https://news.yandex.ru/yandsearch%3Fcl4url%3Dria.ru%252Fsociety%252F20160815%252F1474364557.html%26lr%3D11212">have already written about this initiative</a> do not provide an entirely correct comparison with the sensational Pokemon GO, others draw analogies with the squealing and denunciations of the Soviet era. <br><br>  The appearance of an application capable of correctly fixing the location of the violation is, first of all, a simplification of the bureaucratic procedure and a new tool for increasing civil liability.  That is, the notorious ‚Äúcome when the kill will be‚Äù, at least in case of driving along, for example, trawlers, will gradually sink into oblivion: the very fact that you can receive a ‚Äúletter of happiness‚Äù for many violators will become a serious deterrent.  Up to this point, traffic police and similar services in the CIS responded to similar events only during raids or after fatal incidents. <br><br>  The Mincomsvyaz is already developing the application, and the <a href="https://regulation.gov.ru/projects">Ministry of Internal Affairs of the Russian Federation proposed amendments to the Administrative Code</a> in order to legalize the use of the received video and photo materials through software without a written statement from the citizen. <br><br>  The old appeal procedure was as follows: <br><br><ul><li>  photo and video materials were sent to the traffic police; </li><li>  the person who sent the materials needed to fill out an application; </li><li>  to come to the inspection; </li><li>  Interior Ministry officials collected information, interviewed witnesses and conducted investigations; </li><li>  only after that measures were applied to the violator. </li></ul><br>  The law gave everything for everything for two months from the moment of the violation, therefore, law enforcement officers often did not physically have time to meet the deadlines. <br><br>  Now, as the Ministry of Internal Affairs hopes, with the help of the new application, the vigilance of citizens and the introduction of changes to the Administrative Code, the whole matter will be noticeably accelerated. <br><br>  The software will be available on the state portal.  services and, apparently, will use the real passport data of the citizen who downloaded it.  As planned by the Ministry of Internal Affairs, the average user will not be able to somehow edit the photo or video obtained using the software, and geolocation will help determine the exact location of the offense. <br><br>  The idea to create an application that will help control public order and the observance of traffic rules did not arise just like that.  The project ‚ÄúAssistant of Moscow‚Äù is already successfully operating in Moscow, and in Tatarstan - the ‚ÄúPeople's Inspector‚Äù.  Plus, there is a successful experience with the Ministry of Internal Affairs of the Republic of Belarus.  For several years now, on Twitter, with the assistance and authorship of the current spokesman for the Minsk city police department Alexander Lastovsky, hashtag # interception has been actively used and a <a href="http://xn--80adia2chrv.xn--90ais/">web site of the same name has been</a> created, through which a citizen can report an offense.  After the application, the information is officially transmitted to the control room, and, based on practice, the reaction of the police follows it.  One of the disadvantages of the system is that it is a civil initiative and is not directly connected with the Ministry of Internal Affairs.  The project of the Russian colleagues is reaching the level of creating an appropriate legislative base and centralized, official use. <br><br>  Unfortunately, the materials from the DVRs, which most often fix the most serious traffic violations, remain behind. <br><br>  It would seem that a commendable initiative that will help increase the overall level of civic responsibility and more effectively deal with inadequate drivers, however, this whole situation has a downside.  The offender, according to the law, will still be able to request the data of the accusing party, that is, the operator, which may lead to a spiral of violence and reprisals against ‚Äútoo vigilant‚Äù citizens. <br><br>  Is it possible to call the initiative of the Ministry of Internal Affairs a denunciation system?  More likely no than yes.  In EU countries, going to the police with a message about a violation of traffic rules or law and order leads to a quick and tough reaction of the authorities, and the main motivator not to violate the law and order is the safety of their own funds, since even for smoking and driving you can get a considerable fine.  Russia is still in some puberty period of public self-consciousness, where lynching, and, as a result, breaking the law, is considered by the majority of society to be a more acceptable development of events than contacting internal organs.  It is quite possible that the initiative of the Ministry of Internal Affairs will ‚Äútouch the ice‚Äù, and the simplification of the procedure will demonstrate that first of all the interested party, the society, is able to effectively help maintain order in the streets and without damage to property in the style of ‚Äústopham‚Äù or assault. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/396731/">https://habr.com/ru/post/396731/</a></p>
