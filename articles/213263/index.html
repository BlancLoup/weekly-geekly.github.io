Probably not loved by many Arduino. <br>  Therefore, it is necessary to know the <a href="http://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%25A1%25D0%25BF%25D0%25B8%25D1%2581%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BA_%25D1%258F%25D0%25B7%25D1%258B%25D0%25BA%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B2_%25D0%25BF%25D1%2580%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B3%25D1%2580%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BC%25D0%25BC%25D0%25B8%25D1%2580%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B2%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B8%25D1%258F_%25D0%25BF%25D0%25BE_%25D0%25BA%25D0%25B0%25D1%2582%25D0%25B5%25D0%25B3%25D0%25BE%25D1%2580%25D0%25B8%25D1%258F%25D0%25BC">other</a> , which I do not have, but there are many smart people.

      In the topics on Habr√© author's post is clearly separated from the comments.  Sometimes, after publication, the author voluntarily adds comments from some users to his post. <br>  But everything can be radically changed ... <br><br><h5>  The idea of ‚Äã‚Äãimplementing a collective post </h5><br>  The author of the post comes up with the title: ‚ÄúThe subject of the letter and the address of the message‚Äù, if you wish, writes a brief introductory part, puts Habracut <a name="habracut"></a>  and publishes a post.  His discussion begins. <br>  A program running on a topic‚Äôs computer constantly monitors a post.  When new comments appear, email, tracker or tracking of the comment field, they are included in the text field of the topic and it is republished. <br>  The comments are arranged in the text strictly in the order of the time of appearance in the field of comments to this topic.  This is different from the tree structure adopted in the comment field, but allows you to change the meaning of the text in the most unexpected form. <br>  The program can work on the server Habra.  This gives round-the-clock performance and automatic information about the receipt of a comment. <br><br>  Fasting will be kind and dynamic.  If the comment gets a grade below the plinth (zero), the program evaporates it from the post, after which the meaning of the main text changes again.  If the comment goes out of the red zone, then its text reappears in the text. <br><br>  The name of the author of the comment, the time of its appearance and evaluation in the post do not fall (if you wish, this information can be found in the comments field), only the text of the comment is published with the formatting, links, photos, etc. <br><br>  In fact, the post is obtained from comments with a non-negative rating, arranged in the order of their receipt. <br>  The content should be fun, sometimes even related to the message of the letter. <br><br>  What this will lead to and what storylines will determine whether the content of the post will develop or not depends on many factors: the name of the topic, the interests of people, their activity, mood, phase of the moon, time of day and day of the week, as well as many other reasons. <br>  If it works in some places or is generally interesting, you can make several similar letters, and not only on April 1. <br><br>  Readers of the post will no longer have preferences - read the comments or just the topic itself, everything is located together.  And commentators become co-authors of the post and can always say: ‚ÄúI also participated in writing!‚Äù <br><br>  It is necessary to solve the problem of the same time. <br>  If the program will ‚Äúspin‚Äù on the Habr server, then this problem will disappear. <br>  If the post's author is on the computer, then you need to figure out in which order to post comments with the same appearance time. <br>  Options: <br>  - in alphabetical order of the first letter beginning the comment; <br>  - by the number of letters (the more, the longer it was written, which means earlier at the beginning of the idea); <br>  - most likely, messages about new comments are sent to the mail or tracker in the correct time order, you just need to check; <br>  - other options. <br><br>  The time of the appearance of the comment in the post. <br>  It can be done immediately upon appearing, or after the end of time, giving the opportunity to change the comment.  Both cases are interesting for confusing the following text, which will be written by other co-authors / commentators. <br><br>  The writing will be unfinished, you can always add another ‚Äúlast‚Äù word.  But it is possible to limit the time of writing the ‚Äúwork‚Äù, for example, three days. <br><br>  For the sample, you can take any post and arrange the comments in the order they are received.  It is only necessary to take into account that in this case comments are often not very tied to the main topic of the post, since discussion threads roll into many separate topics.  But this is their charms. <br><br>  In the comments, you can discuss both the idea itself and various aspects of the implementation, and from the vote it will become clear the most important thing. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/213263/">https://habr.com/ru/post/213263/</a></p>
