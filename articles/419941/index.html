Today (in the first part of a large photo tour) the focus is on the business center, showrooms and cinema halls. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/xq/5o/_r/xq5o_rmc8w8juvbckkxdgn5adaw.png">  <i>Our microformat - Telemania <a href="https://t.me/audiomaniaRU/">channel</a> "Audiomania"</i> <br><br> <a href="https://habr.com/company/audiomania/blog/419941/"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/zq/bk/xo/zqbkxoh-g_mogri4p_pottf6_7i.jpeg"></a> <a name="habracut"></a>

      The nearest station is m. Elektrozavodskaya.  The road from the subway takes no more than 5 minutes.  At the entrance to the territory you will meet the sign "Audiomania" with an arrow.  She points to the checkpoint of the office center (this checkpoint is shown in the photo above). <br><br>  To find our office, after the checkpoint, go straight ahead and then turn left.  Between the buildings you will see another of our signs (entrance number 11). <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/jv/7a/3z/jv7a3zgzacg83fvpzv_ccpgvnx0.jpeg"><br><br>  In our office, we equipped several special rooms - two cinema halls and a showroom, in which we organize various exhibitions and seminars. <br><br><h2>  Small cinema hall </h2><br>  At the entrance you are met by the reception desk, decorated in the acoustics style of the Old School brand (we will tell about the acoustics just below).  The door leads directly to the big showroom. <br><br>  The door in the photo on the right leads to one of the office sections - it will be discussed in the second part of the photo tour - and to the small cinema hall (in the photo below). <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/-r/dx/ry/-rdxryf-_sisl0biufbhg2ctp2g.jpeg"><br><br>  The small cinema room looks like an ordinary living room.  However, this is a full-fledged cinema in Dolby Atmos format based on the ‚Äúinvisible‚Äù acoustic panels Cerasonar. <br><br>  The columns are mounted directly into the plasterboard walls, where neat rectangles are cut, where the acoustic panels are placed.  Then the surface is plastered. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/de/hp/mh/dehpmhhkb55_w6maviwpm8z3soo.jpeg"><br><br>  We wrote about the acoustics of <a href="https://www.audiomania.ru/shop/ceratec.html">Ceratec</a> in <a href="https://www.audiomania.ru/content/art-5248.html">our ‚ÄúHi-Fi World‚Äù</a> and discussed it <a href="https://habr.com/company/audiomania/blog/401693/">in one of the episodes of the ‚ÄúSound‚Äù podcast</a> .  While this decision is unfamiliar to most buyers.  We built the showroom specifically to correct the situation and show these systems in action. <br><br>  About this acoustics and our small cinema two television programs have already been shot, and we are seeing an increase in interest in such ‚Äúinvisible‚Äù solutions from interior designers.  For them, the integration of "traditional" speakers is a real headache: you have to take into account the location of the system in the interior, its appearance, and hide the wires.  And here, great sound from the speakers, which are completely invisible. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/bn/1h/7l/bn1h7lve_6plllwqa4q3sw6pv7i.jpeg"><br><br>  This is the Cerasonar column itself: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/mv/mb/7x/mvmb7x1eabsozt7p5r-ennk8sre.png"><br>  <font color="#A9A9A9"><i>In the photo: <a href="https://www.audiomania.ru/vstraivaemaya_akustika/ceratec/ceratec_cerasonar_1520_x1.html">Ceratec Cerasonar 1520 X1</a></i></font> <br><br>  A video on how to install this solution can be found on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3DE6DtBqqx-ag">the manufacturer‚Äôs official YouTube channel</a> . <br><br><h2>  Big showroom </h2><br>  Our experts are always ready to assist in the process of selecting components for an audio system, to advise on headphones or speakers.  However, we are convinced that it is always better to entrust the final choice to the buyer.  For these purposes, we have built a large showroom in which you can independently evaluate the sound of the acoustics. <br><br>  The showroom room is specially ‚Äúsharpened‚Äù for listening to audio systems.  It creates a comfortable acoustic atmosphere: the walls are treated with damping material and sound-absorbing coating.  To sign up for drying, you need to <a href="https://www.audiomania.ru/contact/">contact the store employees</a> or <a href="https://www.audiomania.ru/showroom/">fill out a form on the website</a> (at the bottom of the page). <br><br>  Usually, one or two clients come to auditions per week (sometimes their number grows to five or six).  You can listen to all the acoustics installed in the hall, and if the necessary system was not there, then we bring it from the warehouse.  There are situations when one or another acoustics is located in the Russian Federation in a single copy and stands in the supplier's showroom.  At the same time, in order for it to ‚Äúplay‚Äù, a long process of setting up and installation is required - in this case, we will organize an audition ‚Äúon the spot‚Äù. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/wg/wh/22/wgwh22ytsr_kz4xgoz2bgge7uys.jpeg"><br><br>  Listening is better to come with your favorite music.  For tests, it is important to use the recordings that you will listen to after purchase.  This is due to the fact that certain models of acoustics have their own specifics - some reproduce rock in the best way, others were designed with the expectation of classical music. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/z7/cg/uh/z7cguhhzqogks4uofgokeoalob8.jpeg"><br><br>  At the same time, don't forget about the recording quality - we recommend taking tracks recorded in Hi-Res formats with you.  It is clear that even the coolest and expensive devices will not be able to reach their full potential, if they play they will be squeezed or ‚Äúcut off‚Äù audio material. <br><br>  If for some reason you have not brought your music, you can use demodisks, which are offered by major acoustic manufacturers.  They contain tracks that demonstrate the strengths of the devices.  It cannot be said that such recordings are a standard and are suitable for all listeners, but they can still help with the choice of speakers. <br><br>  In addition to auditions, we hold presentations and seminars in the large showroom, as well as various events for designers, architects and journalists.  This year, for example, we carried out the <a href="https://www.audiomania.ru/content/art-5759.html">exhibition</a> ‚ÄúContinuing Inspection at Drum‚Äù there - it went along with the Hi-Fi &amp; High End Show and, as the name implies, allowed us to get to know our developments and talk with the engineers are standing. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/2n/z2/ye/2nz2yeidwxvysvwdpygvbti6us0.jpeg"><br><br><h2>  Big cinema hall </h2><br>  Politicians ‚Äúit is better to hear (and see) once‚Äù, we also followed when creating a large cinema hall.  Here you can get an idea of ‚Äã‚Äãthe immersive sound of home theaters in conditions as close as possible to the "battle". <br><br>  In the cinema we show films in FullHD and 4K.  For the most part, these are Hollywood blockbusters with complex, deep sound tracks in the formats Dolby Atmos and DTS: X. However, there is in our collection a Russian picture - ‚ÄúHero‚Äù - it was also released in Dolby Atmos. <br><br>  The demonstration hall is completely soundproofed - the thickness of the front door hints at this (in the photo below) - in the adjacent rooms you can safely listen to other speakers.  We did not just build walls with soundproofing materials, but built a ‚Äúroom inside the room‚Äù.  We talked more about the construction stages in the <a href="http://vigorousspace.co/zvoook/00039">39th edition of the Sound podcast</a> [ <a href="https://www.audiomania.ru/content/art-4852.html">transcript</a> ]. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/iv/d0/sg/ivd0sg817ujays467wtrsduyxng.jpeg"><br><br>  All equipment in the hall is controlled from the tablet.  He <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3D1x2hzU6jnSg">acts as a full-fledged remote</a> control for the cinema.  From there you can ‚Äúcommand‚Äù all system components and playlists, switch video tracks and adjust the volume. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/dx/oi/-6/dxoi-6imojufnibwbirrx3iz8ri.jpeg"><br><br>  When you go to the cinema, you do not see any speakers.  Columns of effects are placed high under the ceiling and painted black so as not to distract.  Part of the acoustics built into the walls.  And the frontal group is hidden behind a sound-transparent screen, which allows for a more realistic transmission of the dialogues. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/bu/ml/3a/buml3amiqrap8zgbqem-wahmiam.jpeg"><br><br>  However, we still outfitted all the columns in the cinema with LED lighting, denoting the outlines of the speakers, so that the viewer could understand where they are located. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/fa/gh/yq/faghyqhn6w9bfj4fy7n26fzpikq.jpeg"><br><br>  The cinema hall was made according to the immersive sound format 9.4.6 scheme based on the acoustic systems of our own <a href="http://www.audiomania.ru/shop/ice.html">ICE</a> design.  The 9.4.6 configuration includes nine surround satellites, four subwoofers and six ceiling speakers. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/zr/ni/gb/zrnigbgg0brhld_iw3w4kmyy4c0.jpeg"><br><br>  Subwoofers work in conjunction with professional-grade amplifiers.  The heart of the system is the Trinnov Altitude 32 processor. It decodes the audio data and distributes it between 19 ICE speakers.  This allows you to create a realistic sound stage. <br><br>  Just in this cinema hall we recorded one of the releases of our podcast, in which we discussed hi-fi trends, new music and movies. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/DgQwh5KmQcE" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><hr><br>  <i>This is where the first part of our photo tour has come to an end.</i>  <i>We thank you for your attention!</i>  <i>In the second part, we will show office space for engineers, a store, a warehouse and an office part.</i> <br><br>  <i>By the way, while we are preparing the second part of the photo tour, we bring to your attention our microformat - <a href="https://t.me/audiomaniaRU/">Telegram-channel</a> "Audiomania":</i> <i><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/xq/5o/_r/xq5o_rmc8w8juvbckkxdgn5adaw.png"></i>  <i><a href="https://t.me/audiomaniaRU/615">Amazing sounds of nature</a></i> <i><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/xq/5o/_r/xq5o_rmc8w8juvbckkxdgn5adaw.png"></i>  <i><a href="https://t.me/audiomaniaRU/616">How to hear the color</a></i> <i><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/xq/5o/_r/xq5o_rmc8w8juvbckkxdgn5adaw.png"></i>  <i><a href="https://t.me/audiomaniaRU/617">Water songs</a></i> <i><br><br></i>  <i>And narratives in our blog on Yandex.DZen:</i> <i><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/lu/1g/wb/lu1gwb60qf3wy2nt6xrui8tffpm.png"></i>  <i><a href="https://zen.yandex.ru/media/id/5b0e77ae1aa80c98ec3588de/4-izvestnyh-cheloveka-kotorye-uvlekalis-muzykoi-5b575630ca14c800a854832a">4 famous people who are addicted to music</a></i> <i><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/lu/1g/wb/lu1gwb60qf3wy2nt6xrui8tffpm.png"></i>  <i><a href="https://zen.yandex.ru/media/id/5b0e77ae1aa80c98ec3588de/11-interesnyh-faktov-iz-istorii-brenda-marshall-5b45d025e9e97b00a985180f">11 interesting facts from the history of the brand Marshall</a></i> <i><br></i> <br><hr></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/419941/">https://habr.com/ru/post/419941/</a></p>
