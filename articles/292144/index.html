    <h4>  1. "We can not do this" </h4><h6>  It is the ability to solve any customer problems and understand their priorities that makes people and companies successful.  If customers have a particular need especially often, successful people try to study this need in order to figure out how to satisfy it in the shortest possible time. </h6><br><br><h4>  2. ‚ÄúI don't know how‚Äù </h4><h6>  Instead of immediately abandoning the search for solutions, successful people try to figure out everything that can be done.  Moreover, this applies both to work (say, to do everything possible to successfully complete the project) and to personal life (for example, you will not see a good international business consultant who visits Italy several times a year and who has not started studying Italian language). </h6><br><br><h4>  3. "I do not know what it is" </h4><h6>  If you ignore any problem or tell the client that you do not know what to do with it, then believe me, the client will find someone who will try to solve this problem.  Be honest with the client: keep him informed and notify me of any problems that arise, and, most importantly, always end your sentence with the words: ‚ÄúBut I‚Äôll find out now.‚Äù  This will give the client confidence, and you - time to still help solve the problem (see point number 2). </h6><br><br><h4>  4. ‚ÄúI have achieved everything myself‚Äù </h4><h6>  Successful people know that it is just necessary to surround themselves with people who are smart, sober, and as purposeful as they are. </h6><br><br><h4>  5. "It's too early." </h4><h6>  You would never have heard Benjamin Franklin or someone like Steve Jobs say, ‚ÄúIt's too early for me.‚Äù  Whether it is a corporate meeting, a project launch or a discussion of a new opportunity at the very beginning of the day, successful people will do everything to be there.  Being in the right place at the right time is an integral part of success, whether it is a lark or a night owl. </h6><br><br><h4>  6. "It is too late" </h4><h6>  At the same time, if a potential business partner offers you a business meeting at 9 pm, and you have the opportunity to go to it, go.  The next day you may feel tired, but the connections you made yesterday during a small meeting can make a big difference in your business and / or career. </h6><br><br><h4>  7. ‚ÄúUnfortunately, we will not be able to work together‚Äù </h4><h6>  Sometimes there are people with whom it is difficult to find a common language, however, if these people may be you (or your company) really helpful, you need to find an approach to them.  Otherwise, it will be done by someone else and leave you in the cold. </h6><br><br><h4>  8. ‚ÄúLet's go back to this a little later.‚Äù </h4><h6>  Many times this phrase was said for nothing, without any real continuation.  Successful people know that if they really want to continue the work begun with someone later, they will do it.  Moreover, if you say this phrase and continue not to take any action, you can earn a not very good reputation and delay your success. </h6><br><br><h4>  9. ‚ÄúSorry, but I'm too busy‚Äù </h4><h6>  If successful people encounter a good opportunity on the way, they go to meet her, by all means.  Of course, sometimes you need to find more time, but if you want to use the opportunity, you will have to pay this price.  As the ancient Chinese philosopher Lao Tzu said: ‚ÄúTime is a created thing.  Saying: ‚ÄúI have no time,‚Äù is the same thing as saying: ‚ÄúI do not want.‚Äù </h6><br><br><h4>  10. "It was exclusively my idea" </h4><h6>  Again, as mentioned in paragraph 4, the most successful people tend to share fame upon the completion of outstanding projects.  No idea can belong to one single person - it is the result of interaction and exchange of ideas between a whole team of specialists.  Promotion is an integral part of a healthy corporate (and not only) culture. </h6><br><br><h4>  11. ‚ÄúI never read books‚Äù </h4><h6>  Studies show that rich people read (and listen) a lot more books than the poor: ‚Äú63% of rich parents force their children to read at least two popular science books a month, while only 3% of poor parents do it . ‚ÄùAlso,‚Äú 63 percent of the rich listen to audiobooks on their way to work versus 5 percent among the poor. ‚Äù  Reading popular science (as well as fiction) helps get rid of stress, develop creativity and improve memory. </h6><br><br><h4>  12. "I'm not good enough" </h4><h6>  An important part of success is high self-esteem.  Be yourself, it will ensure your success in business and personal life.  Go for your true interests.  What would you do in life if you didn't need money? </h6><br><br><h4>  13. ‚ÄúOkay‚Äù (again and again) </h4><h6>  Successful people know when to stop accepting an apology from others and leave.  If there is any obstacle, and something (or someone) prevents you from completing your project on time, focusing on your affairs or getting closer to your goals, then it is time to set boundaries and stop your participation in it.  Your time is the most valuable resource. </h6><br><br><h4>  14. "If our competitors do not have it, then we also do not need it" </h4><h6>  Copying competitors is one of the most common causes of the collapse of a company.  True innovations come from the outside: you need to find out what competitors do not have, and fill this niche yourself to be the first to satisfy market demand. </h6><br><br><h4>  15. "Leave for wimps" </h4><h6>  It is foolish to assume that all successful people work on a 24/7 schedule.  Very often, new ideas do not come during the work day, when you sit at your desk, but during the weekend, when you are on a walk with friends, or during a vacation.  Successful people have long understood this and try not to neglect holidays and days off. </h6><br><br>  Have you refused to use these phrases and decide to change your life?  We support.  And <a href="http://icanchoose.ru/blog/s-chego-stoit-nachat-esli-vy-reshili-izmenit-svoyu-zhizn/">that</a> 's what you should do. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/292144/">https://habr.com/ru/post/292144/</a></p>
