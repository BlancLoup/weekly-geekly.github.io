In pursuit of conversions, only ‚ÄúPribluds‚Äù are not hung by the developers, like on a New Year tree: here the callback ‚Äúwinks‚Äù, there the online consultant suggests to talk, after the pop-up sticks ‚Äúonly today, only for you ...‚Äù And You can make the buttons brighter, so that it is noticeable and the users immediately reached for their wallets.  And so on to infinity: change, add, rearrange. <br><br>  How to avoid mistakes and not to alter the landing page?  Always start with text.  One of our subscribers wrote: ‚ÄúIf you read the text and want to call after it, then you can call the designer and layout designer.  If not, redo it again and again. ‚Äù  We vote for it with all limbs!

      In this article you will learn what and how to write on the landing page.  In the case and without the "water".  Those who develop the landing page, the material will help save time and money.  For those who want a growth in conversion, clear the text of debris and make it more convincing. <br><br>  Next we will examine the headings / subheadings, a description of the services and advantages of the company, where there is the most office space and empty words.  On specific examples, with recommendations how to fix it.  Plus we give a simple UTP formula.  So let's go! <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br><h2>  Title / Subtitle </h2><br><br>  Here we fix three problems: <br><br>  1) Title as the service name.  What you are doing?  Plastic windows: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/11c/52e/6c0/11c52e6c06724684a930f2751d9556c9.jpg"><br><br>  And ... everything.  Well done, take a pie from the shelf.  Supercompetitive topic, one click in the Directive on targeted keywords costs more than 2,000 (!) Rubles.  How to remember you?  Unclear. <br>  The title does not sell goods.  He sells attention: ‚ÄúOp-pa, something interesting, these guys are not like everyone else.  Must see. <br><br>  2) The opposite sin: verbiage, when too many words without specifics. <br><br>  As in the following example - about everything and nothing.  To give the liner to the order button, they told about a huge range, the best solution and even saving time and effort. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/1bd/098/897/1bd098897f6741fb8a048214abae304a.jpg"><br><br>  What's the point?  ‚ÄúDude, we do dofig what.  Do not waste time studying, zhmakay on the button. "  From what ...? <br><br>  3) Slip with the target audience.  When you work clearly with some segment of the audience, these people should recognize from the first second: ‚ÄúYes, this is an offer for me.‚Äù <br><br>  One of our subscribers sells designer bags for wholesalers.  These citizens do not tolerate chatter and want to know how much they will earn on your product. <br><br>  Initial option: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/ca3/9f9/f5d/ca39f9f5df304be29ff90a3b2119a407.jpg"><br><br>  Vysokomrzh ... What?  A word from the economics lexicon.  Tooth give that 50% of the target audience do not know it.  And where are the wholesalers?  A hint of sales - "100% high demand."  However, go guess. <br><br>  What they did: clarified + added a clear profit margin: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/be5/a27/b3f/be5a27b3f1014171a0a7a6ebca229694.jpg"><br><br><h2>  Simple UTP formula </h2><br><br>  Everyone knows about the unique selling proposition, but very few people use it.  The main objection is ‚ÄúHow to make it if we have the same product?‚Äù The whole ‚Äúsalt‚Äù is in the details.  Product or service does not differ from competitors?  Play on the benefits of service, working conditions, delivery.  With facts and figures, in the world of the client. <br><br>  Tsiferki "from the bald" will not pass.  Write about what is really important for this audience.  1-2 strongest "chips".  What your customers pay the main attention to, what is most often asked of managers, what details incline them to the transaction. <br><br>  <b>We recommend two schemes:</b> <br><br>  1) The subject of advertising + benefit + benefit.  The easiest option.  An example is just designer bags.  Indicated that we are selling + gave measurable benefits. <br><br>  Another example: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/c42/e22/ed8/c42e22ed86744eb5bb856fea1d4632ce.jpg"><br><br>  2) 4U headers. <br><br>  Full version: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/91a/d6f/197/91ad6f197cb24dc3848d4c00a1779ba3.jpg"><br><br>  In this case, it is enough to use 3 elements - an active benefit, a measurable benefit, and due to which the client will receive this benefit.  No time factor: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/2c9/6cf/d2f/2c96cfd2fce54bbe94ac0653b01a7e35.jpg"><br><br>  For details of the mechanics, see the article <b><a href="https://habrahabr.ru/company/yagla/blog/296920/">‚ÄúHeaders by the 4U method: 30 examples‚Äù</a></b> . <br><br>  <b>The important point</b> : be careful with numbers.  They attract the appropriate people. <br><br>  For example, a banal topic - the development of landing pages. <br><br>  Option number 1 <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/be6/395/20a/be639520a05846f386e13217f843ed6e.jpg"><br><br>  Who will attract such a headline?  Nishchebrodov and BMovtsev (which is often the same thing), who are accustomed to beg for discounts. <br><br>  Adequate customers pay attention to the nuances of the work and the end result.  Development terms and conversion forecast, for example. <br><br>  Option number 2 <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/2f1/c9f/fe4/2f1c9ffe4c8c4954a225e81f9e8e44de.jpg"><br><br><h2>  Description of the product / service </h2><br><br>  If the situation with the headings is more or less tolerable, then ‚Äútrash and waste‚Äù begins in the product descriptions. <br><br>  Immediately emphasize: long text descriptions do not fit every product.  It is not necessary to explain things in the spirit of "captain obvious".  We came across such opus: <br><br>  ‚ÄúPlastic windows consist of glass and plastic‚Äù; <br><br>  "Entrance doors will protect you from thieves and drafts." <br><br>  Many web studios like to paint the essence of the Landing page: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/ba8/efb/84e/ba8efb84ef8347a98ed8a84e2beb389b.jpg"><br><br>  Suppose customers come to them without a concept of landing pages.  How we would write it: <br><br>  1) ‚ÄúWring out‚Äù unnecessary phrases without losing the meaning: <br><br>  <i>"Landing (landing page) encourages visitors to refer to an ad, to the target action - a call, request or order goods."</i> <br><br>  14 words instead of 66!  What is bad: the definition is faceless, there may be questions. <br><br>  2) Let's show the process, add facts and "buns" in the client's world: <br><br>  <i>‚ÄúLanding is a special page where visitors come from advertisements in Yandex and Google, social networks.</i>  <i>We make sure that at least 7 out of 100 of these visitors call or leave a request to you - we create a unique selling proposition, we write convincing texts.</i>  <i>We do not create pictures from the Internet - our own designer works on staff.</i>  <i>After creating the landing, we set up to set up an advertising campaign. ‚Äù</i> <br><br>  You can still ‚Äúconjure‚Äù, but this is enough to understand what we are doing, how we are doing, what results we guarantee + we close the need for an RC, which will appear 100% after development. <br><br>  Another example is the Apple Appliance Repair Workshop.  Source text: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/e85/908/219/e859082192ee48f29a3516c7a9817ee9.jpg"><br><br>  Key things - what specific equipment we are repairing;  what specific work we are doing;  experience and qualifications.  Everything a customer needs.  Let's try to make this a ‚Äúhuman-understandable‚Äù text without ‚Äúwater‚Äù: <br><br>  <i>‚ÄúWe have been repairing Apple hardware since 2012 - iMac, MacBook and Mac mini.</i>  <i>We fix the damage from the non-closing cover to the processor.</i>  <i>Change any details, add memory, restore data.</i>  <i>Only original spare parts, there is always a monthly stock.</i> <i><br></i>  <i>Spilled coffee on the keyboard for us is not a sentence, but everyday work.</i>  <i>In 50% of cases we return to the life of the equipment, which was abandoned in other centers.</i>  <i>For any repair we give a 3 year warranty. ‚Äù</i> <br><br>  As you can see, besides the description of the services, we have fulfilled a possible objection ‚Äúwhat if the necessary part will not be?‚Äù <br><br>  <b>Important points:</b> <br><br>  1) Adjust to the target audience.  Let's take the development of landing pages: if ‚Äúblondes‚Äù come, throw out nafig html 5 and a / b tests.  Any misunderstanding in the text plays against you (the objection "this is too difficult, it is not for me"). <br><br>  2) Talk only about what influences decision making.  With numbers. <br><br>  3) Be ahead of objections. <br><br>  If the product is new, explain ‚Äúon the fingers‚Äù how it works.  Ideally - using graphics.  Sample <b><a href="http://yagla.ru/">Yagla</a></b> Landing Page: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/ec7/c4f/38c/ec7c4f38cb1143688b811c53dd4d436b.jpg"><br><br><h2>  The advantages of the company </h2><br><br>  Landing authors like to call them ‚ÄúWhy 100500 clients work with us‚Äù or simply ‚Äú10 advantages of our company‚Äù.  And if the company is new to the market, but can it give odds to the leaders?  All these show-offs do not interest anyone.  It is much more honest to write the headline ‚ÄúWhat you get‚Äù or ‚ÄúWhat we guarantee‚Äù. <br><br>  OK, now by the wording.  "Palim" secret technique developed in the depths of the FSB: <br><br>  1) Start with the text about the product or service (see the previous part). <br><br>  2) Write out all the facts with numbers. <br><br>  3) Make from this a list of benefits with short explanations. <br><br>  Voila!  No fiction "from the bald." <br><br>  How to write?  For example, pull out the list of benefits from the landing of a construction company: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/90f/335/fe3/90f335fe33284d909aad5f55a257a779.jpg"><br><br>  We see this thrash in varying degrees on every second landing page, so the scheme is suitable for builders, flower sellers and IT specialists.  It's simple: decipher these words: fast, reliable, high-quality, excellent, professional, rigorous, wide, etc.  Show what you mean, because each person has his own understanding of speed, quality and reliability.  For example: <br><br>  Quality - "We bring parts from Germany." <br><br>  Reliable - "Withstands the weight of 130 kg." <br><br>  Comfortable - "Fit in a jeans pocket." <br><br>  <b>How we would write the advantages of builders:</b> <br><br>  Delivery - "We buy and bring building materials directly to the object"; <br><br>  Construction control - ‚ÄúThe work is checked daily by the chief engineer‚Äù; <br><br>  Terms - ‚ÄúWe finish as agreed.  For every day we put a bottle of Hennessy over ‚Äù; <br><br>  Cleaning - "Clean up we take out all the garbage." <br><br>  And for the sake of all that is holy, never write phrases with ‚Äúcarry out‚Äù and ‚Äúare.‚Äù  Everything is much simpler: <br><br>  <s>"We carry out transportation of goods"</s> - "We transport goods". <br><br>  PS Throw in the comments your examples - we will help with the wording. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/301942/">https://habr.com/ru/post/301942/</a></p>
