Currently, the share of cash payments in the world accounts for about 85% of the total number of consumer payments.  This percentage is also noted in some countries where the majority of the population has access to non-cash payments.  Nevertheless, every year the share of non-cash payments is gradually increasing.  <a href="http://www.mastercardadvisors.com/cashlessjourney/">MasterCard Advisors</a> offers to make a trip through the ‚Äúcashless world‚Äù and see how, under the influence of local factors, the world is gradually moving to electronic payment systems for purchases.  Source of the CNBC report.  And we, the site about payment systems with monitoring of exchangers <a href="http://web-payment.ru/">Web-payment.ru</a> , have added it. <br><br>  Each of the countries presented below is evidence that it is actually possible to build a cashless society, and that once all existing barriers are removed, any state will be able to quickly switch to an electronic payment system for goods and services.  Below is a ranking of the leading countries in the world in the introduction of non-cash payments. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h4>  1 Belgium </h4><br><ul><li>  The share of non-cash payments in the total volume of consumer payments: 93% </li><li>  Percentage of Belgians with a debit card: 86% </li></ul><br>  Belgium has become one of the most progressive countries in the field of cashless payments.  Improving the efficiency of payment systems is one of the priorities of the Belgian government.  Most of the country's population is urban and has free access to payment services, modern payment infrastructure and the latest technologies.  It should also be noted that the Belgian government has imposed a limit on cash payments in cash, the maximum amount of which may not exceed 3,000 euros.  However, this is not the only revolutionary payment solution.  Recently, a new mobile payment system was launched in Belgium that allows you to pay for purchases using QR codes.  The application created to manage the new wallet, called <a href="https://www.sixdots.be/">Sixdots</a> .  The mobile wallet is designed to work with Android and iOS operating systems.  The payment system is supported by many Belgian banks and the mobile operator Proximus. <br><br><h4>  2 France </h4><br><ul><li>  The share of non-cash payments in the total volume of consumer payments: 92% </li><li>  Percentage of French with a debit card: 69% </li></ul><br>  France has achieved great success in avoiding traditional methods of payment due to the large number of banking clients (97% of the country's population), as well as the government program aimed at improving the efficiency of payment systems and financial accounting of payments.  France focuses on the introduction of innovative approaches in the field of electronic payments, the release of modern payment products, such as mobile payment systems, contactless cards and mobile POS-terminals to meet the needs of all French payers.  On February 13, 2014, Visa Europe and French telecom operator Orange announced the launch of Orange Cash contactless payment system in Strasbourg and Caen.  These two cities occupy leading positions in the number of users of contactless payments in France.  Orange became the first French mobile operator to offer its customers its own contactless payment system.

    <h4>  3 Canada </h4><br><ul><li>  The share of non-cash payments in the total volume of consumer payments: 90% </li><li>  Percentage of Canadians with a debit card: 88% </li></ul><br>  Canada demonstrates a high level of payment system development due to a high level of financial accessibility (96% of Canadians aged 15 years and older have a bank account) and a government program aimed at optimizing the national payment system.  The successful initiatives in the field of cashless payments can also be attributed to the timely introduction of POS devices and the rapid spread of MasterCard PayPass cards, which gave impetus to the development of new payment solutions with NFC support.  78.1% of Canadian outlets are equipped with POS terminals, with an average of 2.13 POS devices per Canadian store.  The market volume of mobile POS-terminals and devices intended for receiving contactless payments is growing annually by 9.2% and 16.4%, respectively. <br><br><h4>  4 United Kingdom </h4><br><ul><li>  The share of non-cash payments in the total volume of consumer payments: 89% </li><li>  Percentage of Britons with a debit card: 88% </li></ul><br>  In the UK, cash is usually used for small retail purchases, but often even minor purchases are paid using PayPass.  Currently, there are not many places in the country where only cash is accepted for payment.  In the UK, there are more and more points of acceptance of contactless cards in those places where consumer interest in such solutions is maximum, for example, on toll roads and in public transport.  Today, there are 1, 326, 333 POS terminals in the UK, with the share of mobile and contactless POS devices in the total number of POS terminals increasing annually by 14.3% and 26.7%, respectively.  The total amount of mobile payments made through the popular British Paym system exceeded 26 million pounds.  Two thirds (66%) of all Britons are aware of mobile payments, and more than half (52%) of them are familiar with <a href="http://www.paym.co.uk/">Paym</a> . <br><br><h4>  5 Sweden </h4><br><ul><li>  The share of non-cash payments in the total volume of consumer payments: 89% </li><li>  The percentage of Swedes with a debit card: 96% </li></ul><br>  There is widespread use of debit cards for retail payments in the country.  Refusal of cash payments is also due to the reduction in the share of small purchases and the introduction of new technical solutions, such as PayPass and mobile applications for purchases through a smartphone.  Since Sweden has long set itself the goal of reducing the use of cash, the Swedish government sought to make electronic payments affordable, affordable and ubiquitous.  Currently, the volume of contactless payments in the country is about ‚Ç¨ 9.5 billion. The leading Swedish mobile operators - Telia, Tele2, Telenor and Three launched <a href="http://wywallet.se/">WyWallet</a> - a mobile payment service, already 97% of which use NFC-enabled mobile phones. . <br><br><h4>  6 Australia </h4><br><ul><li>  The share of non-cash payments in the total volume of consumer payments: 86% </li><li>  Percentage of Australians having a debit card: 79% </li></ul><br>  In Australia, cash is fought by reducing the share of cash payments when making small retail purchases.  Australian payment systems, including MasterCard and EFTPOS, have recently introduced new tariff rates in order to attract as many customers as possible to make small cash purchases for electronic payments.  At present, the efforts of all Australian payment operators are aimed at capturing the market for small retail payments.  The efforts of payment systems are not in vain.  Australians are increasingly preferring contactless payment methods.  Sellers also show interest in electronic payments, equipping their outlets with payment terminals.  Last July alone, more than 58 million payments were made in Visa PayWave in Australia.  Between November 2013 and November 2014, the share of contactless mobile payments in the country accounted for 60% of all debit card transactions. <br><br><h4>  7 Netherlands </h4><br><ul><li>  The share of non-cash payments in the total volume of consumer payments: 85% </li><li>  Percentage of Dutch with a debit card: 98% </li></ul><br>  Over the past few years, the number of non-cash payments in Dutch supermarkets has increased significantly.  This growth was the result of the national project Hotspot, launched in 2012 by the Efficient Payments Development Foundation (SBEB).  The goal of this initiative is to increase the security and convenience of payment transactions by customers of stores equipped with plastic card terminals.  Last year, there were about 2.9 billion plastic card transactions in the Netherlands.  The number of contactless payments also increased significantly and amounted to 8.3 million in 2014. <br><br><h4>  8 United States </h4><br><ul><li>  The share of non-cash payments in the total volume of consumer payments: 80% </li><li>  Percentage of Americans with a debit card: 72% </li></ul><br>  After Apple introduced its e-wallet, and along with Microsoft and other high-tech companies released smart watches with payment capabilities in America, there was a significant increase in the number of non-cash payments. <br><br>  Ken Shen, CEO of American Express, said that he was not afraid of the loss of plastic cards as a type of payment instrument, moreover, Chenot did not rule out that in the coming years, ATMs would also become unclaimed. <br><br><h4>  9 Germany </h4><br><ul><li>  The share of non-cash payments in the total volume of consumer payments: 76% </li><li>  Percentage of Germans with a debit card: 88% </li></ul><br>  The Munich Oktoberfest, widely known for its national costumes dirndl and lederhoze, as well as drunken American tourists, has become quite an expensive event in recent years: last fall a liter of beer at a famous festival cost about 10 euros. <br><br>  A small consolation for the participants of the event was that they did not have to carry cash to pay for their purchases: to enjoy a glass of fresh Bavarian beer, it is enough to carry a credit or debit plastic card with you.  Non-cash payments are accepted via smartphones equipped with an EMV-reader. <br><br><h4>  10 South Korea </h4><br><ul><li>  The share of non-cash payments in the total volume of consumer payments: 70% </li><li>  Percentage of South Koreans with a debit card: 58% </li></ul><br>  The popularity of non-cash payments in South Korea might have been higher, however, social and government initiatives aimed at reducing consumer credit issuance by reducing the number of credit card users do not allow the republic to take a leading position in the cashless payments market. <br><br><h4>  And on what place is Russia? </h4><br>  At present, Russia is not among the countries leading in terms of non-cash payments, however, in general, Russians are not far behind the global trend.  Residents of the Russian Federation are increasingly using bank cards when paying for purchases on the Internet and in traditional stores. <br><br>  So, according to a Synovate Comcon RosIndeks research, as of the end of last year, 60% of adult Russians use bank cards.  Over a quarter of Russians (26%) aged 18 years and older have more than one credit card.  Possession of several cards is typical for economically active groups of the population.  So, at the end of 2014, more than two cards were owned by 32% of residents of million-plus cities. <br><br>  The most popular operations among the owners of Russian cards were cash withdrawals (85%), Internet or mobile services (53%), as well as transfer of funds from card to card (41%) and payment of utilities. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/258625/">https://habr.com/ru/post/258625/</a></p>
