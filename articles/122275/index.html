  <section class="page js-page"><h1>5 tricks for writing a game</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  For some time I have been developing games for Android and in this article I want to talk about my general rules for creating a game (application).  According to statistics, first of all, the fresh game is not downloaded by a child or teenager, namely, an office worker, who spends hours on his pants for the ‚Äúgood‚Äù of the company that pays him money for it.  Large companies resort to blocking computers to download certain sites, put restrictions on working Wi-Fi on MAC addresses of workers' devices.  But this is sometimes not enough. <br><br>  Let's define some exciting games.  I think everyone will agree that Tetris, Lines, Bejeweled and the like should be on this list.  There are 5 tricks that are typical for these games. <br><br>  So, consider these tricks ... In fact, the tricks for making big and exciting games are pretty simple and reasonable.

      1. Uploaded and play <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  If the player does not have to read the instructional instructions and can immediately start playing, this is a great advantage for any game.  Gamers want to play, not read boring manuals ... so give them what they are used to doing.  Of course, on more complex levels it makes sense to read the FAK in order to arrive at the best result, but the beginning should be simple and intuitive for everyone. <br><br>  2. Mentally light <br>  Many players want to relax the brain from everyday tasks.  That is what they find in the toy.  Of course, do not make silly games.  Make a game that requires only basic cognitive effort.  Here is one game for an example from your favorite Appstore <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/paper-glider/id384044746%3Fmt%3D8">itunes.apple.com/us/app/paper-glider/id384044746?mt=8</a> There is no meaning here, just fly a paper airplane so that it does not fall.  This can be done for a very long time and the head does not ‚Äúboil‚Äù <br><img src="http://cdn.pocket-lint.com/images/yXMW/aotd-paper-glider-iphone-ipad-5.jpg?20110124-110525" alt="image"><br><br>  3. Promotion <br>  Everybody likes being flattered.  This can be done with good words like: ‚ÄúCongratulations‚Äù, ‚ÄúBest score‚Äù, etc. Bonuses for which you can download a new level.  Or at the end of a successfully passed level you hear a storm of applause, shouts or screams that are heard not only to you but also to potential gamers around, this is always a huge plus to the game.  Here is a great example. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/08d/21d/e8b/08d21de8b42ba19d2b040d4de2c5217f.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  4. Competition <br>  Live competition is always held in high esteem!  Allow gamers to upload their best results to a public server and upload tables with new records in this game.  It always stimulates players and increases the time spent in your favorite "hairpin" <br><br>  5. Progress <br>  Every gamer wants to see his game progress.  No need to do long and laborious levels - it is annoying.  Each new Levl should last 7‚Äì9 minutes in order for the user to beat him with pleasure in the event of no luck.  By myself I know the difficult and long level is better to skip (if there is such an opportunity) than to restart for another 20 minutes without a guarantee of victory. <br><br>  Learn games <br><br>  Do not just play, and learn the game.  Many people are fond of games, but few understand them, and this is the key to creating games.  Why is it impossible to break away from some games, while others cause only boredom and a desire to bring them back to the store?  Why do some games immediately cause delight, while others - irritation?  The difficulty lies in the fact that there are no generally accepted rules for creating games, therefore many projects are developed on the basis of pure intuition.  Studying games, trying to understand the reasons for their popularity or unattractiveness allow you to gain experience, which is so necessary to create good games.  But remember - the experience just does not come: just spending time behind the monitor screen is not enough.  It is necessary to constantly analyze all the games that fall into your field of vision, asking yourself why they were made that way and not otherwise ... </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/122275/">https://habr.com/ru/post/122275/</a></p>
