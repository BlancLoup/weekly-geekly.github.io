      It would be more correct to take the last one (3G - I used it only for a couple of hours), but the first one will appear on the photo (2G), since  it was he who was at hand.  I won it, by the way, in a stupid contest of a newspaper)) <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/eaf/3df/afe/eaf3dfafe7b285b5a2d8cb555d431e7e.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Both fighters belong to the lightweight category (up to 20 grams), however, the slaughter has to be promising) After all, Apple and Cowon know a lot about musical things. <br><br><h2>  Doping Control </h2><br>  Shortly before the fight, important information came from the test lab.  As it turned out, both fighters used 2GB of music in different formats before the battle. <br><br>  Cowon E2 injected in MP3 files, WMA, OGG (up to Q10), FLAC (0-8) and WAV. <br>  The iPod Shuffle introduced MP3, AAC, Audible, Apple Lossless, WAV and AIFF files via enema. <br><br>  Laboratory analysis showed that no prohibited substances were detected.  By the way, the elder brothers of fighters (watched the battle from the stands) are able to eat 4 GB each. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/94c/67a/dd6/94c67add6e5924144fabe9b52c9ab3bb.png" alt="image"><br><br><h2>  Round 1: Package Content </h2><br>  The ipods are shipped in a small plastic case, where they are carefully secured.  Included - a player, headphones and instructions.  In the second generation, there was a docking station for the USB connector, in the third, a simple 4.5cm long cord (USB-&gt; Mini-jack) was used instead.  Also in the updated version, new headphones with a remote control are used, which excludes the possibility of using any other headphones (there are no buttons on the player)! <br>  Hint: in the box from the player it is convenient to store all sorts of small details like jumpers, screws, bolts and other batteries. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/1b5/1a0/088/1b51a0088f0ac7d0d4b500b9c54f6f29.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Cowon E2 comes in a ‚Äúsoft‚Äù plastic package in the form of a prism, which is about half the size of an iPod package.  On the "hypotenuse" of the prism is the player itself, inside - standard headphones, instructions and USB-cord (USB-&gt; Mini-jack) 10cm long. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/083/5b7/0be/0835b70be93a4ecc734f191b56a74105.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><h2>  Round 2: Appearance </h2><br>  <b>ipod shuffle</b> <br>  The dimensions of the case (with fastening) of the new ipod are 45.2x17.5x7.8mm.  The player itself is made of either anodized aluminum (weight = 10.7 g) or stainless steel (17.2 g).  If the player is positioned as a musical toy for active wear, then it is strange that there is no titanium in the list - it would be both easy and indestructible.  The case has a clip, thanks to which the player can be attached a lot (without fanaticism).  At one end there is a point status indicator, a 3.5-mm stereo headphone jack and a three-position switch (Off / Shuffle Off / Shuffle On).  Matte body, with rounded edges, made in different colors (gray, black, light green, blue and pink). <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/0b3/8c9/d8a/0b38c9d8a81d138aa3b0404e91add079.png" alt="image"><br><br>  <b>Cowon e2</b> <br>  The player is still "brick-shaped" - all the same right angles with clear edges.  But this time, this is probably a functional plus and not at all to the detriment of appearance.  The case has dimensions of 26.6x64.2x7.7 (mm) and weight 16.6 (g);  Made of matte plastic.  It also has several body colors (it is easier to insert a picture than to describe them): <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/5ff/f52/680/5fff526808f849432971a662bcb763d1.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  In the middle of the bottom end there is a headphone jack (or for charging), on the other end there is a metal ring that will allow the player to wear as a pendant.  It‚Äôs possible that the producer (and some of the case colors) hints at Central Asia in the girls' face, but I felt completely normal with the white player I was wearing in my hand or my pocket. <br>  On the back of the player, the ring, there are two screws, which seem to be the ring and fasten.  If they unscrew, you can significantly reduce the weight and size of the player.  There are also two ‚Äúpoints‚Äù - a functional indicator of the work and Reset. <br>  On the front side, absolutely nothing - all the most delicious on the sides.  On the one hand there are two buttons - ‚Äúrocker‚Äù for volume control and the menu button - when pressed, allows changing the equalizer modes, while holding it - changes the playback mode (in order / apart). <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/00a/8d4/4f5/00a8d44f53dd9d18920f62a9949b0c0d.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  On the other hand, the same swing for track management (FF and REW) and the power control button. <br><br><h2>  Round 3: Turn on and work </h2><br>  <b>iPod Shuffle 3G</b> <br>  I think it makes no sense to talk about the file playback itself.  But about the differences in playback between players - it is possible;) Onboard, embedded <b>VoiceOver</b> technology, which Apple seems to be making yet another attempt at introducing its iTunes to the masses.  The meaning of technology - when you press the central button of the remote on the headphones, the player puts in the ‚Äúlive broadcast‚Äù the pronunciation of the name of the song, artist or playlist.  Everything would be fine, but first, for the function to work, you must first make friends with iTunes, and secondly, by listening to the synthesized reading of Russian tags, you can learn a lot about your music collection. You can evaluate the sound sample on the official website.  So the chip will be more in demand for foreign compositions, with tags that are full order. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/bcb/d93/58a/bcbd9358ab8746b8cebed95e08707cb8.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Do you need to tell about downloading via iTunes?  ) By the way, I once used the Floola utility - I liked it much more than a combine. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/a71/f2a/274/a71f2a2741f1087bbf3b0bf51bd86f79.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  The player on one charge plays 10 hours - for most cases it will be enough to use it.  If you turn off the player and immediately turn it on, the voice will say an approximate battery charge. <br><br>  <b>Cowon e2</b> <br>  It's all much easier.  When connected, it is detected as removable media and any files can be downloaded to it (i.e., the player can be used as a small USB flash drive; a couple of tracks and a detailed manual in Russian were originally recorded).  Lots of well-thought-out small chips - playback stops when the ears are turned off and the player turns off the like idle after a minute, the indication of the built-in LED (the description of which has a whole page in the manual), etc. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/f30/f66/c6b/f30f66c6b565fdc3a0d2224ff0e27399.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  There is no voice synthesizer per se, however, the machine sometimes chatter.  In particular, when switching the equalizer (more precisely, the BBE + sound modes), the selected preset is pronounced.  There are nine of them - Normal, BBE, BBE ViVA, BBE ViVA 2, BBE Mach3Bass, BBE MP, BBE Headphone, BBE Headphone 2, BBE Headphone 3).  What is BBE +?  Well, the supposedly cool sound technology that people like Eric Clapton, Michael Jackson, Jon Bon Jovi and others used to record their tracks ... for me it‚Äôs just a good sound, changing the presets of which is equivalent to changing the equalizer.  But in general, BBE + is something new, fresh, cool, inaccessible to mere mortals - did you expect me to write this?  ))) <br><br>  Time to full charge is approximately 1.5 hours, after which the player can listen to 11.5 hours. <br><br>  Both players support the ability to update the firmware. <br><br><h2>  Round 4: Features </h2><br>  If the iPods have been sucked already far and wide, then about Cowon E2 on the Internet, I really did not find anything even in the lands of Obama.  Therefore, I will focus on it in more detail.  More precisely, on one of his unpleasant moment. <br><br>  The fact is that the player itself has two symmetry axes (both go through the ring) - accordingly, when the player is in the pocket, it is impossible to understand which side the volume and equalizers are and with which track control and shutdown.  In any case, the mistake of pressing the button will be unpleasant. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/811/0d5/447/8110d5447a059b373285a9047c0339de.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  As an option - you can independently somehow change the surface of the player for tactile identification, but why the manufacturer did not do this is not clear.  After all, it was possible to make the buttons different or move them at the ends ... but no.  So while the player has to periodically get out of his pocket.  By the way, the weight of the player allows it to hang not only on a chain (like a pendant), but also simply on headphones. <br><br>  Speaking of headphones.  Usually they are not subject to discussion, but in this case it is impossible to pay attention to them, because  This is one of the key points.  The fact is that Cowon E2 supports absolutely any ears (I didn‚Äôt even listen to them, for they are the same as they were in <b><a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/hardware/74093/">Cowon D2 +</a></b> and <b><a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/hardware/72322/">Cowon S9</a></b> ), the new Shuffle is only those that come from the kit, since  they are "remote control".  Old shafla also worked with any headphones. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/218/0bb/ae4/2180bbae4ff66977fe7f9e59508ca0e9.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Standard ipodovskie ears?  They sound very mediocre, while having poor sound insulation - in the subway or on a busy avenue, you will have to turn the volume up to its maximum.  In addition to this, the plugs themselves are quite large - many of them can and will be just, but when I lived with a shuffle (2G), I quickly changed them.  And for what reasons: 1) they are very easily soiled 2) over time (week-month) the rubber layer peels off, from which sharp edges come out, due to which there will be at least discomfort (maximum - you will scratch your ear). <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/2e9/47c/d51/2e947cd51d400548bf06b602a5ddc7bc.png" alt="image"><br><br>  Because  more relevant in this comparison is the latest iPod Shuffle (it came out later), the headphones of which cannot be changed, then the relevance of its acquisition becomes a very big question. <br><br><h2>  Round 5: Sound quality </h2><br>  I listened to iPods on recordings and headphones, which are not peculiar to me at all. Therefore, I cannot evaluate the details of the sound.  Overall, good. <br><br>  Cowon with me about a week and I managed to drive him in every way.  On four ears - on cold-blooded <b><a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/hardware/67534/">Razer Moray +</a></b> , sexy <b><a href="http://www.audio-technica.ru/cat/port/CK/CK_115.html">Audio-Technica CKS70</a></b> and impossible <b><a href="http://www.audio-technica.ru/cat/phones/AD/AD1000.html">Audio-Technica AD1000</a></b> . <br><br>  The sound at first is similar to the sound from the CKS70, only it is less bass.  It is very pleasant to listen, everything is clean and without any artifacts (I remind you that I do not listen to violins and other pianos, therefore I do not listen to individual sounds, but music and songs, listening to the words from time to time). <br>  The biggest impression was made by the open AD1000, which is quite expected - the sound is simply beautiful and exceeded all my expectations.  Very detailed, clear and clear sound of instrumental music (I listened for the sake of interest), dynamic and unclouded, with the transfer of all the nuances of recording on "electronics", as well as impressive vocal reproduction.  But you can only enjoy being at home or just in a quiet environment - due to the construction, these monitors have almost no sound insulation (in the metro you will hear that the doors are closing, while everyone will hear what you are listening to). <br>  Despite the fact that listening to these monitors is expected on serious stationary equipment (players simply do not reveal their full potential), the character of the sound production will surprise the unsung individual even from sources in the form of a portable player.  What I personally saw on the example of this E2, as well as on other models from Cowon.  The sound is ravishing;) <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/146/5ff/acf/1465ffacf254db155d3261e347f4541e.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  On the headphones still dwell in more detail, but somehow another time. <br><br>  To summarize, the novelty is designed for Central Asia, which is designed for the same iPod - young people who belong to the sound without snobbery, but at the same time provide a higher-quality sound that can be additionally ‚Äútweaked‚Äù with the equalizer settings onboard with BBE +. <br>  Accordingly, for a pleasant listening of MP3-NIS (or a small number of tracks without compression), you can fit in a couple of thousand rubles, taking a player and good headphones (it‚Äôs better not to save). <br>  For more advanced music people (I don‚Äôt like the word ‚Äúaudiophile‚Äù and that's it), it‚Äôs probably better to look for something else  louder and more dynamic, with a huge volume, with a lot of work time, with a sound EQ and, if necessary, with a display . <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/1ae/f0f/7fa/1aef0f7faa559b993434274c760a8800.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><h2>  Round 6: Victory KO </h2><br>  I have nothing against Apple products - great things for connoisseurs of the beautiful) But in my particular opinion, I lost the iPod in a specific match. <br><br>  <b>iPod Shuffle 3</b> <br>  <u>Pros</u> : <br>  - Metal body, small size and weight, minimalism; <br>  - Playing many formats, including without compression; <br>  - Pleasant aesthetic sensations; <br>  - The possibility of flashing; <br>  - Built-in clip. <br><br>  <u>Cons</u> : <br>  - A small amount (up to 4GB) of memory and operating time (up to 10 hours); <br>  - Headphones are not supported, except for relatives !!!; <br>  - Download music only through iTunes; <br>  - High price (4000r for 4GB). <br><br>  VoiceOver did not consider it a plus, for there is almost no practical value in it. <br>  <b>* upd *</b> - third-party ears can still be used if you pay $ 20 for <a href="http://www.ilounge.com/index.php/reviews/entry/belkin-headphone-adapter-for-ipod-shuffle-3g/">such an</a> adapter.  Thanks Apple for caring;) <br><br>  <b>Cowon e2</b> <br>  <u>Pros</u> : <br>  - Small size and weight; <br>  - The possibility of flashing; <br>  - Supports any headphones; <br>  - A possibility of fastening on a chain or a carbine. <br>  - Playing many formats, including without compression; <br>  - 9 equalizer presets, convenient playback control; <br>  - Ability to use as a flash drive, no additional software required. <br><br>  <u>Cons</u> : <br>  - A small amount (up to 4GB) of memory and operating time (up to 11.5 hours); <br>  - It is sometimes inconvenient to use the player in your pocket due to its symmetry. <br><br>  The price is still unknown, because  The device <a href="http://cowonrussia.ru/%3Faction%3Dproducts%26mode%3Dsearch%26category_id%3D6%26product_id%3D27">is not yet sold</a> .  But I think it will be slightly lower than that of the ipod. <br>  <b>* UPD *</b> The price of a Cowon E2 has become known.  A version with 4GB on board is about to appear in stores at a price of 2,200 rubles apiece. <br><br>  The amount of 4GB in both players recorded in the penalty points, because  for those who listen to multi-megabyte FLAC, it will be like a mockery) By the way, microSD would fit perfectly in both devices.  And I don‚Äôt understand why they haven‚Äôt made a radio so far - after all, this is a primitive that would allow at least something not to rest on the available volume.  The clip is more practical than the ring, but still, the player can be fixed in both cases. <br><br>  Both devices are good, both have pros and cons, and both have a right to exist.  But my personal refereeing decided: in the sixth round, the player Cowon E2 won by technical knockout.  Like Tyson, who bit off part of Holyfield's ear, the novelty bites off an iPod's apple from the other side) <br><br><h2>  If serious </h2><br>  But seriously - I am pleased to observe the success of Apple - in many areas it makes great products.  Their player is surely a great thing that will surely find its buyer.  But the review today, by and large, is not about them. <br>  I am equally pleased to watch Cowon - it specializes only in music devices and, one has to admit, it is making progress in this area. <br>  The novelty is definitely a success - for a person not demanding musical devices (able to be content with such minimalism), numerous trifles of this player gather in a solid barrel of honey.  It is strange that the player did not appear a couple of years earlier, but during the crisis its appearance is very opportune. <br>  Small size and weight, durable case, hardware buttons, excellent sound and, I hope, a pleasant price - all this will please the future owner.  Verified <br><br>  All are free, you can not eat up an apple;) <br><br>  Can make any <a href="http://twitter.com/Boomburum">competition</a> ? <br><br>  <b>Successes!</b> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/75434/">https://habr.com/ru/post/75434/</a></p>
