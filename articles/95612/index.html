Opinion of one expert in 25 tweets</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  <b>Translation of the article mentioned in my <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/webdev/95212/">previous translation</a> .</b> <br><br>  Not many experts are well aware of all the ins and outs of the web.  Among them is <a href="http://www.crunchbase.com/person/joe-hewitt">Joe Hewitt</a> .  For the past ten years, he has worked for industry giants like Netscape, AOL, Firefox, and Facebook (where he currently works).  About iPhone Hewitt also knows not by hearsay.  He was the first to write a great Facebook web application for iPhone (when there were no native applications before), and then the native client is one of the best applications on the iPhone platform.  Therefore, when Joe says something on the case (he does it from time to time), people listen.  And today he decided to speak out. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Responding this morning to an email from Apple CEO Steve Jobs about Flash, Hewitt went on twitter to share his thoughts.  I asked Joe if I could put them in an article, he replied, "of course, why not."  Hewitt, as many of you know, stopped developing iPhone applications due to a conflict with the AppStore user agreement. <br><br>  Today, watching a wave of anti-flash propaganda on Twitter, launched by Jobs' letter, Hewitt said:

      <i><b>- Address your dissatisfaction with the Flash-em on the W3C, the annoying sluggishness of which forced developers to use plug-ins due to the weakness of the standards themselves.</b></i> <i><b><br><br></b></i>  <i><b>- In addition, I appeal to you, the developers, whining whenever the browser offers a "non-standard" but innovative API.</b></i> <i><b><br><br></b></i>  <i><b>- Browser manufacturers must offer non-standard APIs that the W3C can standardize even after they are distributed.</b></i>  <i><b>Waiting for innovation from W3C - death like.</b></i> <i><b><br></b></i> <br>  Thus, Hewitt believes that Flash (and other plug-ins) exist only because the W3C (Administrative Council for Web Standards) is too slow in formulating and adopting new technologies.  He urges browser manufacturers to move away from the limitations of W3C and start experimenting with new APIs. <br><br>  Then he begins to defend Microsoft, the winner (although everyone, including the US government, believes that this was done by dishonest methods) to another company where Joe (Netscape) began his career. <br><br>  <b><i>- 10 years ago we ran into Microsoft, forbidding it to develop IE, transferring the reins to the W3C.</i></b>  <b><i>What came of it?</i></b> <b><i><br><br></i></b>  <b><i>- For those of you who are too young to remember, IE has been developing at a crazy pace from 4.0 to 6.0, just as long as the DOJ (Department of Justice) and the W3C got in the way.</i></b> <b><i><br><br></i></b>  <b><i>- Come on.</i></b>  <b><i>In addition to ActiveX, during 1996-2000, Microsoft developed the web faster than any other browser maker.</i></b> <b><i><br><br></i></b>  <b><i>‚ÄúI don't know why MS abandoned IE, but I know that web developers asked them to stop innovating and just follow the W3C standards.</i></b> <b><i><br></i></b> <br>  Hewitt believes antitrust measures against Microsoft have stopped the development of Internet Explorer.  In 1996, when, according to Joe, the real innovations in IE just started, this browser did not even have a 10% market share, while Netscape had almost 90%.  And as a catch-up, IE had to innovate.  Until he captured the entire web, and then Microsoft, being on a horse, abandoned the product. <br>  Hewitt then pays attention to the development of online stores (including, yes, the Apple AppStore). <br><br>  <b><i>- Why do online stores threaten the web and scare developers like me?</i></b>  <b><i>‚ÄúEvil‚Äù proprietary technology breaks the web into pieces.</i></b> <b><i><br><br></i></b>  <b><i>- I desperately want to become a web developer again, but if I have to wait until 2020, while browsers can finally offer something that Cocoa can already in 2010, then well, it nafig.</i></b> <b><i><br></i></b> <br>  ‚ÄúThe‚Äú evil ‚Äùproprietary technology breaks the web into pieces.‚Äù Is a very challenging quote (still holding back not to use it in the title of the article).  Again, Hewitt claims that the web has not yet reached the capabilities of non-web technologies like Cocoa - and will not reach it in the next 10 years. <br><br>  <b><i>- Did Microsoft patent its non-standard html / javascript / css extensions, not allowing other browsers to implement them?</i></b> <b><i><br><br></i></b>  <b><i>‚ÄúIt's true that [W3C] does not dictate its standards, but developers are ashamed of those who use non-standard APIs.</i></b>  <b><i>That's the problem.</i></b> <b><i><br></i></b> <br>  He reasons here why some of the Microsoft standards were not adopted by the committee (W3C)?  Then he condemns web developers for criticizing other developers who use technology unauthorized by the administrative board. <br><br>  <b><i>- I am outraged by the fact that I have to forget about Cocoa in order to return to creating web applications.</i></b>  <b><i>It upsets how serious opportunities I have to lose.</i></b> <b><i><br><br></i></b>  <b><i>- As it should be: browsers introduce various innovations, users choose the best, after that the W3C standardizes what users choose, the losing browsers implement the missing APIs.</i></b> <b><i><br></i></b> <br>  This is the essence of the Hewitt argument.  Web technologies are not developing fast enough, and why should we use a less powerful language in order to meet web standards?  Again, he hopes that browsers will begin to innovate and force the W3C to embrace these innovations. <br><br>  <b><i>- I like what Cocoa is capable of, I just don‚Äôt like C-like languages ‚Äã‚Äãfor UI programming.</i></b> <b><i><br></i></b> <br>  The reason why Hewitt lacks Cocoa, even if he finds it to be the best of the web languages.  i.e., iPhone Cocoa for creating iPhone applications]. <br><br>  <b><i>- Users will understand that they are required to choose if more developers will sharpen their sites for certain browser technologies.</i></b>  <b><i>Developers will actually choose the winner.</i></b> <b><i><br></i></b> <br><br>  And encourages developers to take active steps to reverse the trend. <br><br>  <b><i>- IE6 was pretty darn cool in 2000.</i></b>  <b><i>It's just not fair to compare it with modern browsers.</i></b> <b><i><br></i></b> <br>  Attention to those who criticize IE6 - remember what happened when it came out. <br><br>  <b><i>‚ÄúUnfortunately, I would recommend Cocoa [and not web languages] at the moment.‚Äù</i></b>  <b><i>I wish I didn't say that.</i></b> <b><i><br><br></i></b>  <b><i>- Cocoa, while not being perfect, is better than web languages.</i></b> <b><i><br><br></i></b>  <b><i>- So make another browser.</i></b>  <b><i>Spit it out.</i></b>  <b><i>You know what is not trifling?</i></b>  <b><i>Buy a new phone for every AppStore.</i></b> <b><i><br></i></b> <br>  Interesting idea.  Hewitt says that it can be a hassle, programming the web for different browsers, much more hemorrhoids - programming applications for various AppStore. <br><br>  <b><i>- I do not blame ActiveX, but the html / css / javascript in IE was one time at a very high level.</i></b> <b><i><br></i></b> <br>  Again, protects IE in those times. <br><br>  And starting from here, Hewitt reflects on the topic of web applications against native ones. <br><br>  <b><i>- Yes it is.</i></b>  <b><i>It would be better for developers to force users to launch different browsers instead of creating thin cross-browser sites.</i></b> <b><i><br><br></i></b>  <b><i>- Something like this happens in the mobile web, where native applications are against web applications, except that the AppStore does not expand the browser, but replaces it.</i></b> <b><i><br><br></i></b>  <b><i>- ‚ÄúBest viewed in X‚Äù was not as bad as ‚Äúbuy another phone‚Äù, which we have now since we were allowed to rot on the web for the sake of developing native applications.</i></b>  <b><i>Those who tried to develop serious native and web applications for the iPhone know that the iPhone Safari is a joke compared to the iPhone Cocoa.</i></b> <b><i><br></i></b> <br>  Hewitt believes that the AppStore have replaced the web, simply because their programming languages ‚Äã‚Äãare better.  And this is our fault with you that the web is rotting, and we allowed it.  His latest tweet message is especially strong: Hewitt, having extensive experience in both native and web technologies, considers iPhone Safari a ‚Äújoke‚Äù compared to what can be done in native applications.  This is something that many developers are whispering on the sidelines, but rarely speak openly. <br><br>  In the end, Hewitt clarifies some of his statements. <br><br>  <b><i>‚ÄúI was cruel to Flash, but we all have to thank Macromedia / Adobe for 10 years of continuing the relay, started by the W3C, Microsoft and Mozilla.</i></b> <b><i><br><br></i></b>  <b><i>‚ÄúAnd actually, it would be bad if the WebKit team were not so damn competent.‚Äù</i></b>  <b><i>Everything, I go out, thanks for listening.</i></b> <b><i><br></i></b> <br>  Honestly, a lot of juicy comments in one day. <br><br>  <i>UPDATE.</i>  <i>Translator's Notes:</i> <i><br><br></i>  <i>Since the comments have a lot of answers about IE, I want to note that the article is not about that.</i> <i><br><br></i>  <i>An article on how to simplify web development by creating innovative extensions (for example, Cocoa) in browsers, and then, using these extensions for all mobile platforms, become independent from AppStore.</i>  <i>Let there be one browser (for example, on the WebKit core) for all platforms with Cocoa-extension, which will work from any mobile phone, communicator, axis, than programmers will create their own version for each AppStore (Apple, Google, Nokia, Samsung, MS) web applications.</i> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/95612/">https://habr.com/ru/post/95612/</a></p>
