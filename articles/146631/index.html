If there is no answer, we feel that something is wrong.  Perhaps some do not feel discomfort from the lack of feedback.  And really - what to worry about if the restrictions are lifted and you can ‚Äúbe yourself‚Äù, as sometimes you can hear from young people. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Feedback can not be one-time.  She is always and she is constant.  For example, you always have ‚Äúfeedback from customer‚Äù.  It is not a one-time (‚Äútoday is and never will be‚Äù) - but quite the opposite.  The child will always tell you that he wants ice cream (or whatever he wants at the time) when you walk with him.  When designing any system, program, device or anything else - feedback is used for its calibration and correct operation. <br><br>  But what if the feedback is broken?  If there is interference in the signal flow?  If there is no feedback at all (everything is <s>gone</s> broke)? 
      <br>

      In this situation, we do not know what the customer or subordinate thinks about us.  The man does not know whether he is hot or cold.  The spacecraft, plowing the expanses of the <s>large theater of</s> space, loses its connection with the MCC.  Everything is falling apart ... <br><br>  There are two types of feedback: positive and negative.  Positive feedback is a type of communication, where a change in the output signal of the system leads to a change in the input signal, which further deviates the output signal from the original value.  Those.  it is an explosion or collapse.  But in any case, this is a clearly understandable ending and end of the existence of the system / process / society.  Negative feedback is a type of communication in which the output signal of the system is transmitted back to the input to cancel part of the input signal.  Negative feedback makes the system more resistant to random parameter changes.  Those.  it is a roly-poly, self-regulating, having a certain standard for correction. <br><br>  If we look from the point of view of processes and management, then all those processes that diverge into distant distances, or vice versa - collapse to zero (well, we designed them like this) - these are processes with positive feedback.  And vice versa - correctly designed processes that allow the system to function the necessary time (laid during the design) is a direct example of negative (corrective) feedback.  A project that is conducted somehow and somehow managed, has a positive feedback or a negative disturbed one ‚Äî it will not be completed on time, with a given cost, with a given quality (individually or all at once).  Renovation in the house, when there are always opinions from the outside, changing your original plan - just the same example.  A restaurant with missing / disturbed negative feedback will go bust because  the quality of its dishes will constantly go farther from the standard (in any direction).  A country ruled with broken or no feedback from the people at all is doomed, just like a project or repair that was managed in the same way. <br><br>  At the same time, repairing or creating from scratch the necessary feedback can often solve 90% of control problems.  In projects, this is often communication.  In system design - the right design.  In society there are all the same communications and processes that can be controlled by society. <br><br>  Unfortunately, many people are not accustomed to reason in such categories.  They are trying to come up with "crutches" for improperly designed processes that support the process / system from different angles.  But such ‚Äúcrutches‚Äù - in 90% of cases, they are not repair of feedback (the creation of an absent connection).  These are crutches, props.  The result of the use of such ‚Äúinnovations‚Äù is always predictable, even with a fairly high degree of accuracy in time, not to mention the 100% probability of a collapse, which the crutches tried to prevent. <br><br>  Thanks for attention.  Feel free to comment. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/146631/">https://habr.com/ru/post/146631/</a></p>
