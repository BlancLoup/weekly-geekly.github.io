A good reason to look back over the past three years and recall the main milestones in the history of smartphones by Sony Ericsson.

These are Walkman music phones (denoted by the W, and one of which, the W660i, has faithfully served me for 4 years), and the Cyber-shot cameraphones of the legendary K series (the Sony Ericsson K790i became one of the most popular phones at that time in the world ), later renamed to a separate line under the letter C. <br><br>  These were successful, but still borrowed from the "big brother" - the company Sony - brands.  Relatively young at that time, formed in 2001, Sony Ericsson needed its own successful brand, and just at that time the smartphone market began to grow.  And it was decided to create an original line of phones - in fact, a series of "smart phones¬ª Xperia, which was supposed to combine the best solutions in playing music, photography with the flexibility and versatility of the smartphone platform, which only mobile OS can provide. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/b0256498/5bf80808/e2af9670/5490d6ac.jpg"><br><br>  The first in the line, the Xperia X1 smartphone worked on Windows Mobile 6.1 (about Android, the first version of which appeared 7 months later, nobody has heard it yet).  The phone was distinguished by high-quality materials of the housing trim, a sliding keyboard and an unusual design of the front panel with triangular buttons.  Special envy of the owners of other Sony Ericsson models at that time could cause a standard miniUSB connector and the standard 3.5 mm audio jack.  By this, all models of the line differed further. <br><br><h4>  Sony Ericsson Xperia X2 </h4><br>  A year and a half later, in September 2009, a new model replaced the X1.  The second and last smartphone on WM in the Xperia lineup, the X-second developed the main ideas embodied in the previous model. <br><br>  The buttons on the extendable half-curved clave found bevels around the edges and it became even more convenient to press, and the keyboard itself was also pleasant and reliable to push forward time after time. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/fa1ffddf/159d5195/a14d7357/306ac761.jpg"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/cd312a99/ff9f9cc8/84eade2e/c57b2ca5.jpg"><br><br>  The model has a more rigorous and stylish design, an enlarged display (from 3 "to 3.2") and a microUSB connector, functionally it has been enriched with a 8.1 megapixel camera, built-in stereo speakers, motion and lighting sensors. <br><br>  The X2 also came with a stylus, and the software survived two updates ‚Äî in April and May 2010, to Windows Mobile 6.5.2 and 6.5.3, respectively, so that, as a reliable business phone, it has not lost its relevance. <br><br><h4>  Xperia pureness </h4><br>  A separate feature in the history of the Xperia family is the Pureness model first introduced in September 2009, which formally cannot even be attributed to smartphones - it works on the standard Sony Ericsson java platform. <br><br>  The key feature of the model is a transparent screen.  The ‚Äúpayment‚Äù for the unusual display was its monochrome, which uniquely determines its positioning - the phone is not for geeks, but stylers. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/95ef3034/3455eec8/2027da9e/3c4a923f.jpg"><br><br>  In accordance with the ‚Äúclean‚Äù concept of the phone, its appearance is not disfigured even by the icons on the keyboard - the backlight turns on only in the active state: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/6d979e27/59d7ada5/828d18d0/f851e4fa.jpg"><br><br>  Among the style-forming options is a service such as <a href="http://www.sonyericsson.com/pureness/concierge/pc_activation_russian/">the Pureness-Concierge system</a> , which implies the services of a personal assistant secretary who will help organize a vacation or find the necessary service ‚Äúfrom Moscow to Hong Kong.‚Äù  Before, I heard about similar services going to the load with the goods only in connection with one industrial product - the Maybach car. <br><br>  Another feature of the service that accompanies Xperia Pureness is the free replacement of a failed phone for 48 hours, reminded me of an anecdote about another famous automaker - a real gentleman should have two Jaguars in his garage - one for each day, and the second for the case when the first breaks. <br><br><h4>  Sony Ericsson Xperia X10 </h4><br>  Sign model.  Having announced it on November 3, 2009, Sony Ericsson marked a ‚Äúchange of orientation‚Äù from the losing relevance of the Windows Mobile platform to the promising Android, the 1.6 version of which was new. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/2f5d75ed/5d5f73a6/06e484f6/39d81d5a.jpg"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/62ae8941/7fe4dda7/3efe32fc/328979f4.jpg"><br><br>  This model has not yet lost its relevance, it is being actively sold and boasts <a href="">excellent reviews on the Market</a> , supported by 8 GB of internal memory, a large 4 ‚Äùdisplay, an 8.1-megapixel camera - according to reviews, one of the best among X10 competitors on Android, and Qualcomm gigahertz processor, as well as a unique interface with the original TimeScape application and the Infinite button. <br><br>  <b>Timescape</b> is the event and activity manager, as a social one - including twitter, facebook and contacting notifications, and on the phone: the log of missed calls, sms and mms messages or notes from the organizer can be viewed in the general event feed with one keystroke. <br><br>  <b>Infinite</b> is a miracle button that develops the idea of ‚Äã‚ÄãTimescape, representing, depending on the context, the maximum of related information about any object ‚Äî be it music or a contact in your phone book.  For example, it finds all the events related to a contact in the phone book (calls, sms, tweets, statuses on VKontakte and facebook), or other tracks of the artist you are currently listening to on Youtube (from which you can watch them). <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/65f192e0/a39a281e/0ac600a1/4a39c869.jpg">  ‚Üí <img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/563e6da2/e938886e/476130f9/4d742b47.jpg"><br><br><h4>  Sony Ericsson Xperia X10 mini and X10 mini pro </h4><br>  A smaller, but not trimmed version of the ‚Äúolder‚Äù model Xperia X10, X10 mini was presented on February 14, 2010 in two ways at once - in a more feminine version of a candy bar, with additional interchangeable color panels, and a male-oriented slider with a sliding-out keyboard. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/a73e5bad/e1c706f4/c40416df/17fa3e64.jpg"><br><br>  Against the background of competitors, "minks" are distinguished by small dimensions and a small screen with a diagonal of 2.6 "with a resolution of 240x320. However, a small screen is not a bug, but a feature - its dimensions allow you to fully control the phone with one hand, which was noted when awarding "Red Dot Product Design Award 2010" for the best product design: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/695a236d/0e54b39c/61f2056a/65d5feb2.jpg"><br><br>  Xperia X10 mini in general was not deprived of awards, becoming, in the opinion of the European Association of Images and Sounds (EISA), also the " <a href="http://www.sonyericsson.com/cws/companyandpress/aboutus/awards/award/x10minieisaaward%3Fcc%3Dru%26lc%3Dru">European mobile phone of 2010-2011</a> ." <br><br>  The sliding ‚Äúalmost full-qwerty‚Äù keyboard mini pro version inherited the traditions of X1 and X2 - becoming smaller, it is still very ergonomic and convenient for typing, including blindly. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/8605e399/bf05b5e0/f01b8f8b/3bf7ff63.jpg"><br><br>  In Russia, ‚Äúminks‚Äù went on sale on June 4, 2010, with version 1.6 ‚Äúandroid‚Äù.  Last November, firmware 2.1 was released, which became the formal reason for a large <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/sonyericsson/blog/109438/">joint review of the Sony Ericsson Xperia X10 mini and mini pro</a> . <br><br><h4>  Sony Ericsson Xperia X8 </h4><br>  A budget Android smartphone with high performance is a good suggestion, whatever one may say.  "Junior" in the family was born June 16, 2010.  Initially, the phone came to the market in a white case with a pair of interchangeable colored caps, and it was in this color that he visited us <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/sonyericsson/blog/110786/">for a detailed review</a> . <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/3dad54d4/e812aebc/1e27765e/2055fcad.jpg"><br><br>  At the end of 2010, black models went on sale, and a new Android 2.1 firmware was released - simultaneously with the update for Xperia mini.  By the way, traditionally strong in terms of hardware and design, smartphones from SE were criticized for their unhurried update policy.  Taking into account this experience, the company launched the new 2011 with a new tradition - the latest Sony Ericsson‚Äôs latest from the Xperia line on the freshest Android 2.3 version at the time of release, which was announced a month ago in Las Vegas.  Now all Xperia smartphones will come out with the latest version of Android. <br><br><h4>  Sony Ericsson Xperia Arc </h4><br>  A full review of the novelty is still being planned, but the first acquaintance with it <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/sonyericsson/blog/112497/">has already taken place</a> , and the impressions are very positive - the dimensions are almost the same as the Xperia X10, the arc is lighter, the screen is larger, and the software is fresh. <br><br> <a href="http://community.livejournal.com/sonyericsson/"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/d3f4caf4/582c2d58/8bd95847/dbf242c2.jpg"></a> <br><br>  Plus, several innovative solutions - a screen made according to the standard No air gap, thanks to which the display literally merges with the case, the image quality is the responsibility of the Reality Display with the Big Brother technology of Mobile BRAVIA Engine used in Sony TVs, and the Exmor R reverse illumination matrix Shoot in low light without loss of quality.  In general, a worthy flagship ambitious company with very good roots. <br><br>  But the year is just beginning - Mobile World Congress will start next Monday, and surprises are guaranteed.  One of them, the long-awaited ‚ÄúPSPhone‚Äù, which will be released in people called Xperia Play, <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/sonyericsson/blog/113286/">has already lit up</a> : <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/7851a8eb/3b96aa63/ea89c414/e5a6015c.png"><br><br>  We will be the first to cover information about new items.
