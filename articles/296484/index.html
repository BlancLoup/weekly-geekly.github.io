Recall that as the basis for the classification of services for the construction of contractual schemes, we use a set of their functionality.

      If a <a href="http://www.it-lex.ru/usloviya_ispolzovaniya_servisa/obrazec-politiki-konfidencialnosti-2017/">privacy policy is</a> necessary and sufficient for a site with a feedback form, then a free Internet service with a personal account will additionally require a user agreement.  For the remote sale of goods through an online store, a Public Offer will be added to the Privacy Policy with the User Agreement. <br><br>  Now we will consider the list of documents for paid Internet services and online exchanges. <a name="habracut"></a><br><br><h2>  4. Internet service </h2><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/27d/f82/581/27df8258141149da889da1c645305ff9.png" align="left">  <b>Functional.</b>  View content and service catalog, personal account, remote sale of services by the owner of the service. <br><br>  This group includes any services provided directly by the site owner.  Among the most common, you can list various sites of paid services, catalogs, bulletin boards and services provided by the SaaS model. <br><br>  <b>The package of documents for the Internet service</b> (see. <a href="http://www.it-lex.ru/store/base/dokumenty-internet-servisa/">Description</a> ). <br>  1. Rules for the provision of information services (Rules) <br>  2. User Agreement <br>  3. Privacy Policy <br><br>  Unlike an online store, instead of an offer to sell goods, the standard Rules of Service are used here.  The rules include the procedure for the acquisition of one-time or subscription for continuing paid services. <br><br>  As applied to the bulletin board service, the services may include placing announcements in excess of the established limit, in separate headings, with a special design or priority, for a certain period, etc.  In the SaaS model, as a rule, a subscription to access the service for a certain period is sold. <br><br>  The content of the Rules depends on the category of users of the Internet service.  The Rules for B2B-oriented services additionally include conditions on the procedure for simplified document management in compliance with the rules of accounting and tax accounting. <br><br>  Commercial and technical terms of service are presented in separate documents: tariffs, regulations, etc., which are posted on the website of the service or communicated separately to the client. <br><br><h2>  5. Internet exchange with order processing </h2><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/3aa/c40/461/3aac4046135c437d815ff7abcaf5dafa.png" align="left">  <b>Functional.</b>  View content and service catalog, personal account, remote sale of services between users of the service.  The owner of the service does not participate in the calculations, receives a commission in% of the transaction amount or a fixed rate for the application.  There are other paid features to promote the services of the contractor. <br><br>  <b>The package of documents for the Internet exchange</b> (see. <a href="http://www.it-lex.ru/store/base/dokumenty-internet-birzhi-zakaz/">Description</a> ). <br>  1. Offer for performers <br>  2. User Agreement <br>  3. Privacy Policy <br><br>  The offer determines the order of conclusion between the owner of the service and the executor of the agency agreement.  Contracts for the provision of services with consumers are concluded directly by the performers included in the catalog of specialists on the Internet exchange. <br><br>  The owner of the service does not participate in transactions between users.  The agency agreement with the contractor is only needed for the calculation of the commission as a percentage of the remuneration received by the contractor. <br><br>  In the future, the agency scheme can be used to collect payment from consumers and transfer it to performers through the account of the owner of the service (see the next option). <br><br><h2>  6. Online exchange with payment acceptance </h2><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/fc8/ec5/310/fc8ec53104224995bc88f4fa81b82eb6.png" align="left">  <b>Functional.</b>  Similar to the online stock exchange.  The difference in connecting to the exchange of payment services to collect payment directly by the owner of the service in the interests of registered artists / sellers. <br><br>  <b>The package of documents for the online exchange with the function of collecting payments</b> (see. <a href="http://www.it-lex.ru/store/base/dokumenty-onlajn-birzhi-oplaty/">Description</a> ). <br><br>  1. Rules for the sale of goods (services) <br>  2. Offer for performers <br>  3. User Agreement <br>  4. Privacy Policy <br><br>  As you can see, the list of documents is the same as in the above example with the Internet exchange.  Added only the rules for the sale of goods (services). <br><br>  The emergence of a new document due to the fact that the owner of the service begins to participate in transactions between users.  Therefore, it is necessary for them to introduce uniform rules for ordering and selling goods / services.  This allows you to take into account the facts of the order, payment and delivery of services by the contractor, which are essential for the calculation of commission fees and transfer the balance to the contractor. <br><br>  In addition, the offer for the executors is supplemented by the conditions on the inclusion in the agency agreement with the platform of conditions for collecting payments and transferring them in favor of the performer minus the commission.  The agency scheme in this case is necessary to comply with the requirements of the Federal Law ‚ÄúOn the National Payment System‚Äù.  As stated above, such conditions are additionally linked to the new Rules for the sale of goods / services. <br><br>  We have resulted the main categories of services taking into account functionality which demand legal registration.  Of course, there are many services that can not be uniquely attributed to the proposed classification.  However, the proposed approach to the compilation of legal documentation for sites allows you to quickly resolve such issues. <br><br>  The examples given illustrate that the modular system of legal documentation has a significant advantage in the development of a project or the discovery of a fundamentally new startup.  It is easy to make a replacement in the package of documents, to supplement it with a missing document or to make necessary clarifications in the existing one. <br><br>  As a result, we get savings in time and costs for the creation of legal documentation for any service. <br><br>  <a href="http://www.it-lex.ru/article/primery-dokumentov-sajtov/">A source</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/296484/">https://habr.com/ru/post/296484/</a></p>
