And she showed that the site began to use. <br>  As a result, I moved the site to a separate domain and began to replenish fonts. <br>  What is now. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h4>  Statistics </h4><br><ul><li>  Since moving to their own domain (August 28), the site has been visited by a little over two thousand people. </li><li>  It was possible to identify a dozen sites that directly pull fonts from WebFont.ru. </li><li>  Almost 430 times downloaded fonts (the most popular is Cuprum) </li><li>  They sent about a dozen fonts, but almost all were paid.  Nevertheless, I want to express my gratitude for the activity shown. </li><li>  The site has written two comments, one with a problem, and the second with a recommendation. </li><li>  Tweeted the site 9 times :) </li><li>  I do not consider comments and messages on Habr√©. </li></ul><br>  And all this time the reference mass grew. <br><br>  I must say that I did not really expect that someone would need the site and did it literally on the knee, not really thinking about the usability.  And the problems were obvious. <br>  From the middle of September I started to rework it and now I am ready to present you the latest version of the site - <a href="http://webfont.ru/">webfont.ru</a> . <br><br><h4>  What is done </h4>
      <br>
        <script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>
        <ins class="adsbygoogle"
          style="display:block; text-align:center;"
          data-ad-layout="in-article"
          data-ad-format="fluid"
          data-ad-client="ca-pub-6974184241884155"
          data-ad-slot="8945601208"></ins>
        <script>
          (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
        </script>
      <br>
    <h5>  Some kind of cataloging </h5><br>  Now all fonts are divided alphabetically and by type (with serif \ without, handwritten, monospaced, decorative) <br><br><h5>  Added fonts </h5><br>  At the time of this writing, there are 51 font-families in ~ 150 styles.  A few more fonts are waiting in the wings. <br>  Just want to ask everyone not to be shy and delve into their bins.  Maybe you have a good free font, <a href="http://webfont.ru/form/">send</a> it to WebFont, help the common cause;) <br><br><h5>  Traffic reduction </h5><br>  More or less optimized fonts for viewing.  Now the user does not fall out a huge css with inserts in base64. <br>  Fonts are compressed with gzip and caching is configured.  We are not going to stop at this and we will continue to work on optimizing the load / load.  There is still much to dig. <br><br><h5>  Buns </h5><br>  Since there were more fonts than 10 or 20, it became impossible to use snippets that were written for automation.  When spreading, more than 100 lines of code fell out. <br>  The issue was resolved dramatically - a plug-in for Sublime Text 2 was written. It loads the entire list of fonts when it first starts up and displays the following window: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/552/8a5/1e7/5528a51e70165b95d4ed5de7fce0483d.png"><br><br>  When you click on a line with the name of the font, the line with the import and font-family set for this font is inserted on the current page.  At the top of the window there is a line "* update the list of fonts."  When you click on it, in a split second, the entire list will be updated and you will have the current version of all the fonts of the site.  Since  fonts do not appear every 10 minutes, then we decided to stop on such an implementation. <br>  From day to day, the plugin should appear in Package Control. <br>  The plugin for the site was written by Alexander Solodovnikov ( <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/users/dbc2h/" class="user_link">dbc2h</a> ).  For which many thanks to him :) <br>  For NotePad ++, nothing has been done yet, sorry. <br><br>  In addition, one user script that works with fonts from WebFont was written and <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/151060/">presented</a> in Habr√©.  Soon we will finish it together with the author, and he will serve as a tool for selecting fonts on any site. <br><br><h5>  Hosting </h5><br>  As I wrote above, from the site, contrary to my warnings, they began to draw fonts directly.  Consequently, the load on the hosting has increased.  We had to think something.  I decided to contact my hoster, whom I have been sitting for four years, and ask for a bit of space and memory and all the rest.  Unexpectedly, he quickly received approval for project support. <br>  In general, the site lives and does not bother much. <br><br>  That's all about innovation. <br>  The site works, fonts are replenished, they are used. <br>  Another <a href="https://twitter.com/webfont_ru">account</a> appeared on Twitter.  I chose it as a platform for news site, it is there that will now appear all the news, ads and more. <br><br><h5>  Acknowledgments </h5><br>  I thank my comrades and our colleagues from the workshop: <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/users/alexriz/" class="user_link">Alexriz</a> , <a href="http://forum.htmlbook.ru/index.php%3Fshowuser%3D12397">sigma77</a> , <a href="http://forum.htmlbook.ru/index.php%3Fshowuser%3D27140">Svatov</a> for the advice, assistance, recommendations and feedback.  As well as all those who were not indifferent to the project, wrote articles in their blogs, called the site an analogue of google / webfonts, spoke about the support of domestic producers - you inspire!  :) <br><br>  Colleagues, please express your opinions, suggestions, mistakes, inaccuracies, recommendations, bugs. <br>  The goal is to make the most convenient service for connecting / using web fonts. <br><br>  Thanks for attention. <br><br>  <b>upd 10/24/12 Plugin available in Package Control.</b>  <b>Search by name - WebFont.</b> <br>  <b>upd 11/22/12 Vkontakte page is <a href="http://vk.com/webfont">open</a> - <a href="http://vk.com/webfont">vk.com/webfont</a></b> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/154265/">https://habr.com/ru/post/154265/</a></p>
