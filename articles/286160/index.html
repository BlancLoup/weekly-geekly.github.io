      To understand the importance of learning the latest technologies today, you just need to look back over the past ten years to see breakthrough technologies that have fundamentally changed the modern information infrastructure.  Server virtualization, big data and cloud computing were once nothing more than conceptual hypothetical theories.  However, the most far-sighted of us who investigated similar technologies in the initial stages turned out to be in a significantly advantageous position compared to all the others, after the implementation of such technologies. <br><br>  With the increasing complexity of technology, the time required to comprehend them increases, so that it is in the interests of every industry-related person to identify technological trends as early as possible that can advance the industry to a new level of development in the coming years and find themselves in the ranks of a kind of IT avant-garde. <br><br>  Here you have a small list of modern technologies that are most capable of a breakthrough. <br><br><h4>  Homomorphic encryption </h4><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/8d7/049/897/8d70498975ba4d168377931d8bc9dd37.jpg" alt="cyfer"><br><br>  One of the problems of trampling cloud technologies in place is the lack of assurance of data integrity.  Current encryption technologies leave much to be desired, and force us to either completely trust the suppliers of the "clouds" or encrypt the data before moving them to the cloud.  The second option, as it is more preferable and all that (the fact that you are paranoid does not yet prove that you are not really being watched), is also more inconvenient.  And here homomorphic encryption can come into play.  <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%2593%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BC%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BC%25D0%25BE%25D1%2580%25D1%2584%25D0%25BD%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B5_%25D1%2588%25D0%25B8%25D1%2584%25D1%2580%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B2%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B5">Homomorphic encryption</a> is a form of encryption that allows you to perform certain mathematical operations with ciphertext and get an encrypted result that corresponds to the result of operations performed with plain text.  The concept for more than 30 years has been just a concept.  Homomorphic encryption would allow combining different services into one, without providing data for each service separately.  Over the past few years, some steps have been taken that may soon lead to the creation of fully homomorphic encryption systems. <br><blockquote>  - <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/230645/">Habr: Areas of application of homomorphic encryption</a> <br>  - <a href="http://www2.technologyreview.com/article/423683/homomorphic-encryption/">Technology review</a> </blockquote><br><h4>  Foggy calculations </h4><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/2a2/25a/422/2a225a4228e049fab7963b46f5899909.jpg" alt="fog" align="right"><br>  If cloud computing can be compared to fluffy white clouds high in the sky, the computational fog surrounds us with a myriad of its minor constituents.  Here, fog is considered as a set of any network-connected systems, ranging from PCs to devices from the IoT world.  The main lack of cloud computing is the last mile, slow service delivery to a user from a specific data center without delays.  Instead, this principle comes to providing it with systems that combine the speed of local systems and the power of cloud systems. <br><br><blockquote>  - <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/135568/">Foggy calculations</a> <br>  - <a href="http://www.cisco.com/web/about/ac50/ac207/crc_new/university/RFP/rfp13078.html">Fog Computing, Ecosystem, Architecture and Applications</a> </blockquote><br><br><h4>  3D displays </h4><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/110/1db/f67/1101dbf67e1547b282af9a15548a86f6.jpg" alt="iron" align="left"><br><br>  Three-dimensional technologies for a simple inhabitant are a very expressive ideal of technological innovation.  The main technical problem has always been the translation of slightly different images in both human eyes, for which various crutches in the form of glasses were used (and are still being used).  At the moment, this problem seems to be solved, but the problem of user purpose still remains.  The main question is why?  And while his solution seems to be niche use, in such industries as engineering, design, design, advertising and medicine. <br><br><blockquote>  - <a href="http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2015/01/150115102837.htm">Huge 3D displays without 3D glasses</a> </blockquote><br><h4>  Biometrics </h4><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/db9/326/858/db932685852d459590ed1eec4f527864.jpg" alt="bio" align="right"><br><br>  The modern development of computing power is gradually beginning to translate the problem of selecting, even extremely complex passwords, into the category of easy-to-solve.  And here the natural uniqueness of a single% username% can come to the rescue.  Fingerprints now, however, can only surprise Papuan (although there are <a href="http://old.computerra.ru/offline/2007/695/327708/">controversial opinions</a> about the accuracy of fingerprinting), but there is still an iris, heart rate, face recognition and DNA in the end.  It is clear that over time we will use biometric systems more widely. <br><br><blockquote>  - <a href="http://www.infoworld.com/article/2885187/security/microsoft-biometrics-are-the-future-of-windows-10-security.html">Microsoft: Biometrics are the future of Windows 10 security</a> </blockquote><br><br><h4>  Energy storage technologies </h4><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/b06/80d/5e8/b0680d5e832845e4a054fc41f8d28e54.png" alt="bat" align="left"><br>  While the battery life increases every year and the size decreases, the power still remains the Achilles' heel of mobile technology in the broadest sense of the term.  Here there are not only our smartphones-tablets, but also cars, airplanes and much, much more. <br><br><h4>  Wireless communication </h4><br>  Wireless technology is currently the hottest.  The avalanche-like growth in the number of wireless devices, already in major cities around the world, eats away the bandwidth of networks.  To date, the bandwidth of the frequency spectrum has been limited by the physical nature of the spectrum.  All technologies that use spectrum face these physical limitations.  The question arises: how to connect an unlimited number of devices using limited spectrum bands?  This is a major spectrum related issue.  It has become one of the main directions of development of communication technologies and will be of great importance in the coming decades. <br><br><blockquote>  - <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2015/02/10/usa-internet-autos-idUSL1N0VK1VT20150210">US bill seeks more Wi-Fi airwaves alongside smart cars</a> </blockquote><br><br><h4>  Interaction with robotics </h4><br>  Robotics has recently made a huge step in terms of utility.  Fully robotic production, medical procedures (including operations), law enforcement agencies (sappers), and even catering facilities ‚Äî these and many other areas are likely to do without human labor soon.  At the same time, there are a huge number of tasks that are beyond the control of robots entirely, but in cooperation with people who are quite feasible.  In such industries, you will certainly need very sophisticated software that someone will have to develop and maintain, so that people and robots can effectively interact and solve tasks. <br><br><h4>  findings </h4><br>  In all promising technological industries, there are always some unresolved problems, and the listed ones are not exceptions.  Give me at least one area without any visible problems that can bring significant profit?  The industry in which there are no problems, nobody cares.  The best harvest can be gathered only from freshly plowed field. <br><br>  Obviously, in addition to the above, there are whole clusters of technologies that would also be worth tracking and analyzing, and let this list be a small part of your future investment and production plans.  Let your personal forecasts and the list of promising technologies expand in every way, in which your humble servant will try to provide you with all possible assistance.
