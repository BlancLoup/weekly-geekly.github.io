  <section class="page js-page"><h1>How much should you sleep?</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Recently asked the question: ‚ÄúHow much should I sleep?‚Äù <br> <a href=""><img align="left" src="http://yury.samsonov.name/images/2a015cdeb88f_EA55/image_thumb.png" alt="image"></a>  The motive is that sorely lacking time.  Work, family, a lot of different projects and everything asks for time.  There is an idea to reduce sleep time.  Is it only useful and will I not go away? <br>  On request: ‚ÄúHow much to sleep‚Äù issued 3,130,000 links.  It can be seen this problem interests many.  I opened and re-read them from a dozen, but there is no clarity. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h3>  Article 1 </h3><br><blockquote>  Scientists have finally figured out how long a person needs to sleep in order to live as long as possible and stay healthy - about seven hours a day.  Studies conducted by well-known experts on longevity - the Japanese. <br>  As it turned out, the most healthy were people who usually slept 6.5-7.5 hours, in this group the death rate was the lowest.  For those who slept less than 4.5 hours, life expectancy has decreased by an average of 1.6 times, even more dangerous, as the experiment showed, to sleep regularly for more than 9.5 hours - this shortens life by 1.7-1.9 times. </blockquote><br>  How did they figure it out?  Well, okay, let's go further. <br><br><h3>  Article 2 </h3><br><blockquote>  Winston Churchill believed that a man needed to sleep for six hours, a boy for seven, and only women and fools needed more hours to sleep. <br>  Chronic lack of sleep destroys the immune system, inhibits the production of hormones, leads to nervous exhaustion.  If we are little, or sleep poorly, IQ drops, body and brain reactions are dulled, eyes, skin and hair become dull.  During sleep, growth hormone is produced, which helps children and adolescents to grow, and in the body of an adult person regulates the formation of fats.  Therefore, in order to preserve youth and health, sleep as much as you want.  Each person has the time required for recovery and rest of the body, individually.  In addition, it varies depending on the season and the length of the daylight hours.  A person must sleep so much time to wake up awake and rested. </blockquote><br>  The fact is that you can sleep for a couple of hours and be fresh and vigorous, or you can sleep and wake up for 12 hours broken. <br><br><h3>  Article 3 </h3><br><blockquote>  Unfortunately, light sleep deprivation is considered the norm in our society: everyone is working, and sleeping is supposedly only wasting time to lose ... But I tell my patients like this: you will constantly gain one hour from sleep - your life will be reduced by ten years.  Usually this fact is very sobering. <br>  Suffice it to say that 40 to 50 percent of accidents on the roads, especially during long trips, are due to the fact that drivers lack enough sleep. <br>  People who work at night and go on business trips are dedicated. <br>  I want to say that those who chose such a job have a strong nervous system.  Even among the actors and singers who spend almost all their lives on tour, there is a big dropout in the early stages of a career.  Not everyone will withstand such overload.  It is also known that pilots, truck drivers, conductors on trains - that is, all those who have neither a clear sleep time nor an established ritual of falling asleep, eventually start to suffer from these or other sleep disorders. </blockquote><br>  This is precisely verified by personal experience.

      How much should a person sleep to his body fully recovered? <br><blockquote>  Everyone has their own sleep duration range.  There are people who have very productive sleep cycles, and their nervous system takes much less time to recover.  Such a person will sleep less than the norm, but, as they say, as killed.  (True, some of these ‚Äúshort sleep heroes‚Äù do not even notice how they get the necessary norm when they sleep in the afternoon.) And the other may turn around all night - it will be not enough for him for ten hours, he will get broken, as if he didn‚Äôt sleep at all.  But, as a rule, for an average person you need to sleep at least 7 - 9 hours a day. </blockquote><br>  I read quite a lot of different and interesting things.  It is useful to ask such questions. <br>  I got it, I need to sleep.  I do not understand how much? <br> <a href=""><img align="left" width="119" src="http://yury.samsonov.name/images/2a015cdeb88f_EA55/image_thumb_3.png" alt="image" height="90"></a> <br><br>  What do you think about that?
