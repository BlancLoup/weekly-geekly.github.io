  <section class="page js-page"><h1>The flagship Astell & Kern SP1000: perfectionism to the masses - money in cash</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  At one time, iRiver products were the leader in the mass market of portable players.  Not infrequently, starting stories about their products, many of my colleagues remind readers of this fact.  On the contrary, I want to talk about something else.  Today, the situation has changed radically, since Astell &amp; Kern is a technique for those not many who are not ready to put up with any compromises in portable audio. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/75e/e43/00c/75ee4300c9104da485c70330d9abfec0.jpg"><br><br>  It is often not enough for such people to just listen, they need to know that the devices they use are unique, and the capabilities of these gadgets are superior to any analogues.  It is completely natural that the prices for such "toys" are just as uncompromising. <br>  In this post we will talk about the device, which, without exaggeration, can be called not only the flagship of the company, but one of the best in the history of the industry.

      Looking ahead, I can say that I hold a low-key, often skeptical opinion regarding most high-end decisions.  I consider such devices somewhat unreasonable, in part because of astronomical prices, and also because of the hypertrophic investment in the development.  At the same time, <a href="http://www.pult.ru/product/pleer-astell-kern-a-ultima-sp1000-stainless-steel">Astell &amp; Kern Ultima SP1000</a> is, in my opinion, one of those devices that, in principle, justifies the existence of High End technology as a phenomenon. <br><br>  <i>Under the cut there are subjective listening impressions, an overview of the hardware and functionality of the device, as well as a few words about ergonomics and design</i> <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h3>  First meeting </h3><br>  <i>This is followed by a very subjective assessment and the results of a blind comparison with the list of test compositions.</i>  <i>Those who are interested solely in the description of functionality, hardware and characteristics, I recommend to skip this part of the article.</i> <br><br>  People who visit our showrooms and at the same time read our blog, could draw attention to the fact that the opinions of some of our experts, approaches to sound and equipment are significantly different from mine.  So here is one of my ideological rivals, an ardent supporter of High End and, concurrently, our expert suggested that I listen to the firstborn of the Ultima line from Astell &amp; Kern. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/30c/a13/0da/30ca130dab104503ae3f1dccec8c5362.jpg"><br><br>  I agreed, thinking that it is unlikely that someday natural mischief would allow me to pay 250,000 rubles for a player.  But I didn‚Äôt want to listen just like that - I offered to conduct a blind test and compare it with my not very old COWON (in order not to do anti-advertising to a good manufacturer, I will not indicate the model, I‚Äôll just note that my player is more than 20 times cheaper than <a href="http://www.pult.ru/product/pleer-astell-kern-a-ultima-sp1000-stainless-steel">SP1000</a> ). <br><br>  He always respected iRiver devices with great respect, but, frankly, did not expect to hear a significant difference.  Since I am convinced that the sound quality is almost independent of the source.  For the purity of the experiment, we used the same HiFiMAN HE1000 V2 headphones (which is interesting, despite its low sensitivity, we didn‚Äôt need additional amplification for the SP1000). <br><br>  The following tracks were used as test tracks: <br><br><ul><li>  V.A. Mozart ‚Äì‚Äì the London Philharmonic Orchestra and choir directed by Georg Solti ‚Äì‚Äì The re-major of D minor - ‚ÄúDies Irae‚Äù.  (wav format); </li><li>  Metallica with the San Francisco Symphony Orchestra (Live - 1999) - ‚ÄúEcstasy of gold‚Äù (Ennio Morricone cover) (wav format); </li><li>  Death - ‚ÄúLack of Comprehension‚Äù (remaking of 2011 of the original composition of the album ‚ÄúHuman‚Äù) (DSD format - 2,822,400 Hz); </li><li>  Pink Floyd ‚Äì‚Äì ‚Äúcomfortably numb‚Äù (The Wall) (DSD format - 2,822,400 Hz); </li><li>  Steen J√∏rgensen - ‚ÄúYesterday Is Here‚Äù (Tom Waits cover) (DSD format - 2,822,400 Hz); </li><li>  Steen J√∏rgensen - ‚ÄúHelp‚Äù (Beatles cover) (DSD format - 2,822,400 Hz); </li><li>  Alfred Schnittke - (State Chamber Choir of the Ministry of Culture of the USSR, conductor. Valery Polyansky) Concerto for Choir - 1. ‚ÄúO, Thee the sovereign ...‚Äù (wav format); </li><li>  Alfred Schnittke - (State Chamber Choir of the USSR Ministry of Culture, Valery Polyansky) - Concerto for Choir - 4. ‚ÄúThis work which I begin ...‚Äù (wav format); </li><li>  Eduard Artemiev - ‚ÄúEternity‚Äù (OST Siberiada) (flac format - converted from SACD). </li></ul><br>  The result - in eight of the nine tracks, I unmistakably identified Astell &amp; Kern Ultima SP1000 (I did not hear significant differences only in the track Metallica, I suppose, due to the nuances of the live recording).  I can say that the source more accurately conveys the features of the stereo panorama, making it realistic and voluminous, in other words - this is what audiophiles call the deep and wide stage. <br><br>  The apparent sound sources (CID) in the Astell &amp; Kern sound pattern were arranged more accurately.  T.N.  the detail is ideal, respectively, the level of distortion (at high power) in the audible frequency spectrum is minimized.  Astell &amp; Kern SP1000 made it easy to concentrate on individual parts of instruments in symphonic works and individual voices in choirs.  With my device, such ‚Äúlistening‚Äù required effort, especially when listening to the brass and choir parts. <br><br>  Both players did not give significant differences in timbre sound, which, however, is not surprising.  The sound of the device is very smooth, I noticed certain small accents at medium lows, but I tend to write them off on <a href="http://www.pult.ru/product/naushniki-hifiman-he1000-v2">HiFiMAN HE1000 V2</a> , in my native COWON these accents were exactly the same.  I can not say that I experienced a shock, but I expected a smaller subjective difference, and therefore I was very surprised.  And yet, I can not say with certainty that I heard significant differences between DSD, FLAC and WAV, but perhaps such delights are not for my ears. <br><br><h3>  Iron and software </h3><br>  The performance of the SP1000 is provided by an octa-core 8-core processor (the manufacturer does not indicate the clock speed in datasheets).  Apparently, it (performance) is large enough, because the device provides instant response and the absence of failures associated with speed.  Yuzal is a costly miracle during the week quite actively: he didn‚Äôt reveal any delays or problems with the process loading.  Download almost instant, when using everything happens quickly.  The firmware deserves a separate mention - it is convenient, intuitive and completely free from bugs, which contrasts well with some devices of this type (and not only with budget ones). <br><br>  Support for USB Type-C and octa-core allows you to quickly fill 256 gigabytes of internal memory (speed up to 10 Gbit / s).  If necessary, you can add a microSD carrier for another 256 GB.  The device uses as many as 2 AKM AK4497EQ D / A converters capable of delivering high-resolution sound far beyond the capabilities of human hearing (including burnt, demanding audiophiles).  Those.  Each channel is provided with its own DAC. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/262/bcd/822/262bcd822c4f4c68a0e9d5158d87f77f.JPG"></div><br>  The practical recording resolution ceiling is 32 bit / 384 kHz, DSD's own two-bit reproduction (with a sampling frequency of up to 11.2 MHz).  This is for those who need a bit to bit (like a musician and a sound producer at the studio).  I treat such things with a bit of mercantile skepticism, but of course an audio perfectionist cannot survive without this. <br><br>  Describing my subjective feelings, I have already noted that a sufficiently powerful amplifier was used in the player.  SP1000 easily copes with headphones, where the resistance exceeds 35 ohms and has a significant volume margin.  In this case, the built-in amplifier does not introduce significant distortion. <br><br>  Among other things, the developers took care of amateur wireless devices, equipping the Bluetooth device with the aptX HD codec developed by Qualcomm.  Thus, high-speed (24-bit, 48 kHz) transmission of sound without a wire is implemented.  The codec is interesting in that it has 2 extra bits in each sub-band, which made it possible to reduce the signal-to-noise ratio and reduce distortion when playing high-end format via bt-headphones. <br><br><h3>  Functionality, ergonomics, design </h3><br>  A five-inch touchscreen display with resolution (HD5) breaks the stereotype that in hi-fi / high end players they save on image quality.  Lithium-polymer battery with a capacity of 3400 mA / h allows the device to operate continuously for about 12 hours, while charging in 2 hours.  I think this feature is important for those who are regularly in headphones.  Considering the energy intensity of the technologies used in the player, and the computing power of 12 hours is a lot. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/9ba/c36/ea3/9bac36ea3f624bdaa9008ba2ead30005.jpg"></div><br><br>  The volume control and the ‚Äúpower‚Äù knob are located on the multifunction wheel, which allows you to conveniently control the device.  Of the functional elements, you can also note the playback control buttons placed on the side panel.  However, it is almost standard for devices of this class.  In spite of the aggressive form, which has long been a hallmark of iriver design, the player is easy to handle.  With management, too, no difficulties arose, as I have already written, everything happens at the level of intuition.  A useful feature is the integration with the phone.  Using the Bluetooth interface, the player is able to notify the user about calls and messages coming to the phone. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/895/d05/051/895d050511f240d5980d30b6fd6329a4.jpg"><br><br>  The outer casing is made of steel and is resistant to signs of wear.  I can not say anything about the copper version as I did not hold it in my hands.  But, if I had intended to buy this player, I would surely take a steel one, for personal aesthetic reasons.  Sharp, rather aggressive lines of the case emphasize the ‚Äúthoroughbred‚Äù origin of the gadget.  Anyone who has ever seen Astell &amp; Kern, immediately recognizes the features of the manufacturer.  I would say more, in my opinion - this is perhaps the most original design among devices of this type. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/30c/a13/0da/30ca130dab104503ae3f1dccec8c5362.jpg"><br><br>  According to the manufacturer, the main idea of ‚Äã‚Äãthe design is to appeal to the user the analogy with the precious stone, which has undergone a thorough, jewelery, professional cut.  Very conceptually, given the quality and positioning of the device on the market. <br><br>  And one more important point, our customers using Astell &amp; Kern, note the tremendous endurance and mechanical survivability of devices from this manufacturer.  In particular, this applies to functional wheels, buttons, connectors.  It seems that the South Korean manufacturer ignores the deliberate obsolescence and makes the old fashioned way for centuries.  This is probably a justified step, especially if we take into account the market value of the devices. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/a9b/afd/cc2/a9bafdcc29184c62a0b8427bbec83fb4.jpg"><br><br>  Passport details: <br>  Audio DAC resolution: 32 bit; <br>  Audio D / A sampling rate: 384 kHz; <br>  Outputs: balanced, unbalanced; <br>  Signal / noise: unbalanced - 120 dB (1 kHz), balanced - 122 dB (1 kHz); <br>  THD + noise: unbalanced - 0.0005 (1 kHz), balanced - 0.0008 (1 kHz); <br>  Playable formats: MP3, AIFF, AAC, WAV, WMA, OGG, DSD, ALAC, FLAC, APE, DSF; <br>  Output voltage level (without load): unbalanced - 2.3 V rms, balanced - 3.9 V rms; <br>  Recommended headphone impedance: up to 40 ohms; <br>  Built-in memory: 256 GB; <br>  Screen: 5 inches 720 by 1280; <br>  Wireless interfaces: WI-FI, Bluetooth; <br>  Body material: metal (steel / copper). <br><br><h3>  Total </h3><br>  Astell &amp; Kern SP1000 is designed for people who need not only to hear the perfect sound, but to know that it cannot be different even on a theoretical level.  Given all the technical data of the device, we can safely say that the player is the embodiment of the technological maximum, which is hardly necessary for a simple man in the street or even an experienced music lover.  In my opinion, such a device will be in demand by two categories of buyers.  Extremely demanding audiophiles who want to complete (or suspend) the tedious search for impeccable (divine, transcendent) sound and people for whom such devices are an essential element of status.  Simply put, the SP1000 is ideal for sound and for show off. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/373735/">https://habr.com/ru/post/373735/</a></p>
