Thus, the US counterpart SOPA was adopted on the territory of the Russian Federation, which for American media companies became an experimental platform for introducing a new procedure for protecting copyright and retaining a monopoly on copying and distributing content on the Internet. <br><br>  This is already the third month that we are fighting for the abolition of the Law of Against the Internet.  By our joint efforts, in an unprecedentedly short period, more <a href="https://www.roi.ru/advisement/petition/gosudarstvennoe_upravlenie1/otmenit-zakon-o-proizvolnyh-blokirovkah-internet-resursov-ot-02072013-187-fz-zakon-protiv-interneta/">than 100,000 votes</a> were collected <a href="https://www.roi.ru/advisement/petition/gosudarstvennoe_upravlenie1/otmenit-zakon-o-proizvolnyh-blokirovkah-internet-resursov-ot-02072013-187-fz-zakon-protiv-interneta/">at the ROI for the abolition of the law.</a> <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  On September 19, 2013, the so-called <a href="http://xn--80abeamcuufxbhgound0h9cl.xn--p1ai/events/5508823/">‚Äúpublic hearings‚Äù were held</a> on a petition filed in which there were almost no representatives of public organizations and users.  During the discussion of the petition by the same talking heads from copywriters and IT business, high-ranking officials and deputies, the view was expressed that we are all marginalized and do not understand the essence of the adopted law.  There were attempts to arbitrarily interpret the submitted petition, in connection with which it was concluded that society does not object to the adopted law, but only seeks to make some changes to it.

      Thanks to only <a href="http://geektimes.ru/users/temych/" class="user_link">temych</a> (Artem Kozlyuk), the voice of many members of the Habr community and users of the RuNet was voiced, who asked to either cancel the law or suspend its action until new public discussions are held. <br><br>  However, the government, in its usual manner, laughed at our demands, and showed us all that <a href="http://nr2.ru/moskow/461037.html">it is not going to repeal the ‚Äúanti-piracy law‚Äù</a> , but on the contrary <a href="http://www.pcweek.ru/gover/article/detail.php%3FID%3D155268">intends to expand its effect on all other copyright objects</a> listed in the Civil Code. <br><br>  To date, a <a href="http://blog.pravo.ru/blog/zip/7482.html">large number of different bills have appeared</a> , one way or another offering government regulation of civil law circulation of copyrighted objects on the Internet. <br><br>  Many of us have done a lot of work on open monitoring of website blocking, advocacy activities, constructive criticism of the draft law and making proposals for its radical change: <br>  <a href="http://rublacklist.net/">RosKomSvoboda</a> - a project dedicated to monitoring website blocking and fighting for a free runet <br>  <a href="http://wiki.bloku.net/%25D0%2597%25D0%25B0%25D0%25B3%25D0%25BB%25D0%25B0%25D0%25B2%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B0%25D1%258F_%25D1%2581%25D1%2582%25D1%2580%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B8%25D1%2586%25D0%25B0">Blok.net</a> - <a href="http://wiki.bloku.net/%25D0%2597%25D0%25B0%25D0%25B3%25D0%25BB%25D0%25B0%25D0%25B2%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B0%25D1%258F_%25D1%2581%25D1%2582%25D1%2580%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B8%25D1%2586%25D0%25B0">Wikiproeka</a> , on how to bypass blocking sites <br>  <a href="http://www.rutakedown.ru/">RuTakeDown</a> - a project dedicated to monitoring, examination and self-regulation <br>  <a href="http://dialog.so/">Dialog.so</a> is a project aimed at public discussion on the analysis of the norms of the Federal Law No. 187- and making suggestions from users. <br>  <a href="http://veche.duma.gov.ru/">Veche</a> is the official platform of the State Duma for public discussions, in which many users and experts discuss the accepted norms No. 187- and make their proposals on how to change them. <br><br>  However, being realists, we understand that all this work done is still not enough to force the inflexible vertical of power, which received the go-ahead of the head of state, change its opinion and finally hear users demanding to cancel the adopted law and start new public discussions on the adoption of legal act on content regulation on the Internet.  The propaganda work about the ‚Äútheft of intellectual property‚Äù has been carried on for too long and diligently, and copyright myths have spread in society.  In accordance with the rhetoric of rights holders, a preliminary security measure is necessary to block video content that has not yet been released (the so-called pre-release content).  However, having observed the data in the <a href="http://mos-gorsud.ru/inf/infp/zpo/%3Fyear%3DHH010_year2013">register of blocked content</a> , we see that the indicated blocking algorithm was used by right holders for video content of which the film and television release was implemented a long time ago.  Given the almost endless term of protection provided by the Bern Convention and national legislation (70 years after the death of the author), we can safely assume that all content created in the 20th and 21st century, owned by media companies, and posted on different websites on the Internet will be blocked by such owners right <br><br>  On the side of those who lobbied and voted for this law - the most powerful weapon in the form of central TV channels and controlled by the media.  On our side - the Internet, which is still free.  We need to continue to fight and convey to each Internet user information about what the law is dangerous for, and what consequences it can bear for the entire RuNet. <br><br>  We, the <a href="http://freerunet.ru/">Association of Internet Users</a> , along with the entire Internet community, are fighting for the abolition of the ‚Äúanti-piracy‚Äù law and the reform of the copyright institution in the information age.  Now we are preparing a video about how the law actually works, what its expansion will lead to, as well as preparing an alternative proposal on the regulation of copyright to works on the Web.  There is still much to be done, and we need the support and assistance of every Internet user. <br><br>  We ask all those who want to see Runet free to support our non-commercial project with a ruble and spread information about it (with the placement of <a href="http://affiliate.planeta.ru/widgets-external.html%3FcampaignId%3D2103%26affiliateId%3D145500">widgets</a> ) in all available sites.  We appreciate the help of each user who joined the fight, and will make your name remain in the history of the free Internet forever. <br><br>  <b>UPD 1:</b> To produce a video, we need to make the following costs: <br>  1. 60 000 rubles - the work of the director and operator; <br>  2. 40 000 rubles - the work of 2d-designer to create infographics and effects; <br>  3. 20 000 rubles - equipment rental; <br>  4. 30 000 rubles - promotion of the video in Youtube, social networks and partner networks; <br>  5. 15 000 rubles (10%) - commission Planeta.ru and the payment aggregator. <br><br> <a href="http://start.planeta.ru/campaigns/2103%3Faffiliate%3D145500"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/4ef/fb0/9a5/4effb09a5027feb1e64d4e3f3bfe9539.png"></a> <br><br>  <b>UPD 2:</b> So our crowdfunding campaign has ended to create a video about the need to reform copyright and cancel 187-.  Thanks to all those who participated and supported! <br>  We also thank the portals who posted widgets about our campaign: <br>  <a href="http://kinozal.tv/">kinozal.tv</a> <br>  <a href="http://rutor.org/">rutor.org</a> <br>  <a href="http://opensharing.org/">opensharing.org</a> <br>  <a href="http://free-torrents.org/">free-torrents.org</a> <br>  <a href="http://plushev.com/">plushev.com</a> <br>  <a href="http://chaskor.ru/">chaskor.ru</a> <br>  <a href="http://rublacklist.net/">rublacklist.net</a> <br>  <a href="http://pirate-party.ru/">pirate-party.ru</a> <br><br>  Meanwhile, while the project was still active, we had a long thought about the concept of the video and the script plan.  A rather difficult task is to present complex legal constructions and the topic of legal regulation of circulation and protection of copyright objects for an ordinary user who does not possess specialized legal knowledge in the field of the right to the results of intellectual activities.  And it should be done in such a way that it would be boring, concise and extremely clear what is dangerous about Law No. 187-, why we need copyright reform so much and what we offer. <br><br>  As a result of reflection, we came to the conclusion that the best solution would be to create a video in the form of a conceptual infographic, in which we show: <br>  1. Myths about ‚Äútheft of intellectual property‚Äù, and why they are not true; <br>  2. What is the copyright crisis, and what threats do outdated laws and new bills carry to users; <br>  3. What can really be done to change the existing state of affairs and amnesty millions of potential offenders and criminals; <br><br>  To create such a video, we have attracted great professionals in our field - the company ‚ÄúRezeptor‚Äù, with whom we have already begun work.  The video will be ready in a month and presented to a wide range of media. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/195850/">https://habr.com/ru/post/195850/</a></p>
