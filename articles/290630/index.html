The <a href="http://hbswk.hbs.edu/archive/1590.html">report of the</a> Harvard Business School states that an increase in customer retention by an average of 5% increases profits by 25-95%. <br><br>  To the deep disappointment of many, in ordinary business articles they often write only about customer retention strategies and managing their outflow.  You need more detailed materials.  You have heard about the incredible achievements of projects such as Disney World, where customers return more than 70%.  How to make people like your business so much?
