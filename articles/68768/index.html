Well, if there was a passing cart.  Then some old collective farmer would say ‚Äúclimb, lad‚Äù, and you could take a nap in the straw, while the cart slowly rides through the potholes.  And now, in less than an hour, I find myself in a cold room with a flickering dim light bulb.  The internet was almost a miracle.  The old women were baptized, passing through the windows of the Internet club. <br><br><img src="http://boomburum.ru/wp-content/uploads/2009/09/04.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Detailed review, traffic. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  What about today?  In every McDonalds sit teenagers with laptops.  In schools and couples in institutions, lectures are outlined in the netbook.  Previously, this could not be imagined.  Still, today's young people are lucky: they are ready for anything.

      Netbooks thousandth series of <b>Eee</b> - a classic of the genre.  Similar machines are used not only by ordinary consumers, but also installed in school computer classes around the world.  The presented model 1000HE has already been sold abroad for some time, but we have become rather recently hiding on the shelves.  The 1000HE boasts not only a matte screen and a comfortable keyboard, but also significantly longer battery life - this model is useful to anyone who spends a long time away from the wall outlet. <br><br>  If my information is correct, then the <b>ASUS EeePC 1000HE netbook</b> is the first model on the market that ran on an <b>Intel Atom 280 processor</b> with a frequency of <b>1.66 GHz</b> (this is not any 1.6 GHz from an Atom 270!)) The bus frequency grew to 667 MHz against 533 MHz for the N270.  Energy consumption (at maximum load) and L2-cache remained at the same level - 2.5W and 512Kb, respectively;  The system runs on the <b>Intel Mobile 945GSE chipset</b> .  By the way, there is no point in expecting a big performance gain in comparison with the Intel Atom 270 in this model;  The battery life from one charge is much more interesting - 9.5 hours of uninterrupted work is promised!  Apparently, such promises are made, relying on the less voracity of the new processor and the technology of the <b>ASUS Super Hybrid Engine</b> - we will check. <br><br><img src="http://boomburum.ru/wp-content/uploads/2009/09/cpu.png" alt="image"><br><br>  <b>About netbook</b> .  Inside there is 1024 MB of RAM (DDR2 PC2-5300, 667 MHz; can be expanded by replacing a single bar to 2048 MB);  160GB on SATAII disk (Seagate ST9160310AS, 5400rpm);  Bluetooth and Wi-Fi support (802.11b / g / n), built-in 1.3MP camera.  Works "book" running Windows XP Home 32bit. <br><br><h3>  Equipment </h3><br>  The box fit easily into my portfolio, but, despite its modest size, there were a lot of things inside: <br><br><img src="http://boomburum.ru/wp-content/uploads/2009/09/11.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  - <b>ASUS EeePC 1000HE netbook</b> ; <br>  - Battery (Li-Ion, 6 cells, 7.2V, 8700 mAh, 62Wh); <br>  - Mains wire + AC adapter; <br>  - Special cloth for cleaning the screen; <br>  - Netbook bag; <br><br><img src="http://boomburum.ru/wp-content/uploads/2009/09/31.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  - Warranty, WinXP Quick user guide, XP Support DVD; <br>  - EeePC User Guide; <br>  - Guide to restoring the EeePC to factory settings. <br><br>  One oddity - for many years, manufacturers in every way struggled with glare and prints, and now everyone, as one makes the gloss, but often forget at the same time to put in a box a means to fight against adversity.  So fibrotryapochka - a very useful and effective bonus.  What can we say about the neoprene case, which is made soundly and closes with the usual zipper - it will not protect against falls, but more than against dust. <br>  In the box to the white netbook go white power cord and adapter - all for connecting to a white outlet) <br><br><img src="http://boomburum.ru/wp-content/uploads/2009/09/42.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><h3>  Appearance </h3><br>  The most interesting thing in the box is, of course, the laptop itself.  Its dimensions (LxWxH, mm) are 266x190x38;  weight - 1400+ grams with battery (the battery itself weighs about 300 grams).  The netbook is snow-white, which, most likely, will appeal not only to guys, but also girls.  But to say that in the model can be traced some kind of gender, it is impossible. <br><br><img src="http://boomburum.ru/wp-content/uploads/2009/09/17.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  The outer surface is glossy, but, fortunately, completely unmarked - you can only see the prints carefully peering;  the screen is matte. <br>  The case is made using the technology of <b>ASUS Infusion</b> , which provides increased resistance to inevitable abrasions and scratches that occur during active operation. <br><br>  There is nothing on the outer cover except ‚ÄúEee‚Äù.  On the "belly" - a pair of vents and holes of the speakers, battery latch, 4 rubber feet, stickers.  By the way, about the legs - they hold very well!  I compare with the classmate Acer Aspire legs.  But on my old laptop (also ASUS) they are made of a different material - with age, some agility appeared the other way around.  What else you liked - you can get access to the hard drive and RAM (for example, to increase its volume) by unscrewing only two screws and without violating the warranty. <br><br><img src="http://boomburum.ru/wp-content/uploads/2009/09/5.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  A high-capacity battery (8700mAh) weightierly thickens the device itself, for me it would be better to stick out behind the screen.  On the other hand, such a ‚Äúbottom lift‚Äù allows air to circulate freely under the netbook, so the cooling fan will turn on less frequently. <br><br><img src="http://boomburum.ru/wp-content/uploads/2009/09/8.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  A variety of ports and other functional elements is typical enough for netbooks.  On the left side there is a lock hole, one network (RJ-45) 100-megabit port, one USB (2.0) port, an air vent, and two 3.5mm jacks for headphones and a microphone.  Each connector has its own icon. <br><br><img src="http://boomburum.ru/wp-content/uploads/2009/09/7.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  On the right side there is a memory card slot (MS / MMC / SD-SDHC), two USB ports, a VGA (D-Sub) connector for an external monitor and a power connector for connecting to the network via an adapter. <br><br><img src="http://boomburum.ru/wp-content/uploads/2009/09/9.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  On the back side, as I said above, there is nothing but a non-returning battery. <br>  The last side remained - the front;  If you look at it with the lid closed, two metal buttons and 4 indicator holes to the right of them are partially visible. <br><br><img src="http://boomburum.ru/wp-content/uploads/2009/09/6.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><h3>  Screen </h3><br>  Opening the cherished white cover, the first thing to notice is the black matte screen (10.2 ‚Ä≥, 16:10, 1024 √ó 600 [WSVGA], TFT LCD, with LED backlighting, contrast 832: 1).  Matte means that your reflection will not be visible on dark images.  And with LED illumination look at the image a pleasure!  Viewing angles are not the most outstanding ... but from the angle from which sometimes you have to watch TV, when washing dishes, you can see everything without distortion.  When viewed from below, the colors are not inverted, but noticeably dim.  You can make out the picture in the sun, but it will be much more comfortable to work in the shade. <br><br><img src="http://boomburum.ru/wp-content/uploads/2009/09/10.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Thanks to the bundled program (ASUS Tray Utility), you can change the screen resolution on the go.  There are 3 options available: 800x600 (it looks scary), 1024x600 (the original resolution, all screens in the article are made in it) and 1024x768 (the taskbar appears scrolling if you move the cursor to the bottom of the screen). <br>  Above the screen is a 1.3 megapixel camera.  The image is very good (compare with those pictures that gave the camera from the recent "Battle of the Cyclops"). <br>  Under the "monitor" there are two holes of the built-in microphone and 5 buttons - turning off the display, changing the resolution, two customizable buttons and a button in the switch (s) (separately to the right).  Two customizable buttons will enable Skype and the <b>ASUS Super Hybrid Engine</b> feature by default.  This feature allows you to adjust the speed of the processor depending on its load, which as a result allows you to stretch a long time;  the available modes are ‚ÄúSuper Performance‚Äù (overclocking the processor to 1750 MHz), ‚ÄúHigh Performance‚Äù (1660 MHz), ‚ÄúPower-Saving‚Äù (1250 MHz), ‚ÄúAuto Power-Saving‚Äù (when running on battery) and ‚ÄúAuto High ‚ÄúPerformance‚Äù (when running on a network). <br><br><img src="http://boomburum.ru/wp-content/uploads/2009/09/13.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><h3>  Keyboard </h3><br>  This is what I particularly liked about this model!  The layout is standard, the buttons are square (17.5x17.5) with rounded corners, with a small (about 2mm) keystroke.  The text on the buttons is gray;  what works in conjunction with the Fn button (of which there are now two on the keyboard) is written in blue. <br><br><img src="http://boomburum.ru/wp-content/uploads/2009/09/14.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  The right Shift was returned to its rightful place (on the EeePC 1000H model, which I borrowed from a group mate to write in pairs, Shift was completely to the right - I often swore at developers for such a ‚Äúbold move‚Äù) - hurray!  The right ctrl also grew a bit.  With high-speed typing, the clattering of the buttons becomes noticeable, but this is not so critical. <br>  Perhaps the most unusual thing in this instance is the absence of the Russian layout, because it was a sample from the marketing department of the ASUS Moscow office for me to test (it added that it was immediately clear that this was a sample).  For me it's not scary - at one time I was learning the blind method of printing like that (I just stuck all the buttons), but for novice users this would be a rake.  Naturally, the 1000HE comes with familiar Cyrillic with mass deliveries. <br><br><img src="http://boomburum.ru/wp-content/uploads/2009/09/15.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><h3>  Touchpad </h3><br>  The touchpad in this model also acquired certain changes.  Now it is not Synaptics, but the multi-touch Elantech.  Multi-sensory means the possibility of processing more than one touch at a time - in practice it turned out to be a very convenient thing, it‚Äôs a pity that it does not work everywhere.  At the same time, no more than three touches can be processed. <br><br><img src="http://boomburum.ru/wp-content/uploads/2009/09/pad.png" alt="image"><br><br>  The touch panel with a size of 68x38 mm is edged with a metal frame, below which are two buttons.  They are pressed not very tight, without a loud click - everything is as it should.  What I don't like about many laptops is the ‚Äúdrowning‚Äù of the touchpad, which causes a lot of dust and dirt around its perimeter.  This is not there, so I'm glad again.  The surface material is chosen very well - it is convenient to work on it even with wet fingers.  Sensitive enough sensor, but sometimes a little slow - addictive comes after about an hour of use. <br>  It is good that the lid closes without a click and opens without unnecessary movements. <br><br><h3>  Turn on and work </h3><br>  After turning on the device, the blue operation indicator lights up (in the power button under the screen);  This indicator is duplicated in the touchpad area;  By the way, the hard drive indicator lights up in the same place. <br><br><img src="http://boomburum.ru/wp-content/uploads/2009/09/16.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  You can't call the device silent - the sound of the coolers is noticeable in silence.  However, the hum from them in a normal setting is so quiet that I suggest that the device be considered conditionally silent.  Heats up during normal operation slightly - the keyboard temperature almost all the time was no higher than body temperature. <br>  OS boots fast enough;  after the first launch, you need to spend a couple of minutes on setting up the language of users.  Initially, the screen backlight is almost minimized, but even with a small backlight you can work comfortably.  ‚ÄúScrewing‚Äù a couple of ‚Äúlight bulbs‚Äù, on the desktop you can see the shortcuts for the pre-installed programs. <br>  Despite the fact that the ‚ÄúStart‚Äù is literally teeming with various labels with the word ‚ÄúWindows‚Äù, of course, there is no usual office.  Instead, it installed Sun StarOffice 8. Pre-installed Skype, as it were, hints to mobile operators that widespread skypization is not far off.  Just in case there is even WinDVD - and is it on a device without a DVD-drive? <br>  By the way, you may have already noticed the Hybrid Storage sticker on the touchpad - they say, 160GB + 10GB.  No, this is not HDD + SSD - under the additional ‚Äúdesyatochku‚Äù I mean a place on ASUS Internet servers, which is called Eee Storage. <br><br><img src="http://boomburum.ru/wp-content/uploads/2009/09/12.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  If you wish, you can clean up a lot of things (only in the tray when you run about a dozen icons!) And remove that will only have a positive effect on performance, and therefore on the time of work.  But it is worth noting that even with the initial layout, the netbook works very quickly. <br><br><img src="http://boomburum.ru/wp-content/uploads/2009/09/proc.PNG" alt="image"><br><br><img src="http://boomburum.ru/wp-content/uploads/2009/09/run.png" alt="image"><br><br>  I insert a modem, install Opera - the Internet really flies (although, for 9 SpeedDial cells, six hundred pixels in height, of course, is not enough).  I launch StarOffice - it is possible to work, but it is unusual. <br><br><img src="http://boomburum.ru/wp-content/uploads/2009/09/office.PNG" alt="image"><br><br>  Of course, you can listen to music, but you shouldn‚Äôt expect much from the built-in speakers - you won‚Äôt hear the bass at a football stadium.  In addition, netbooks as a class imply sufficiently active movement on the earth's surface - where are the headphones in the trim levels then?  Manufacturers, think about this moment. <br><br>  In one of the reviews is the following table for performance comparison: <br><br><img src="http://boomburum.ru/wp-content/uploads/2009/09/speed.png" alt="image"><br><br>  I did not chase 3DMark, but CPUMark 2.2 produced absolutely similar results.  By the way, such performance readings were achieved at system default values.  If, however, conjuring, then I am sure, you can achieve great results. <br><br><img src="http://boomburum.ru/wp-content/uploads/2009/09/cpu-bench.png" alt="image"><br><br>  The speed of the hard disk (and there is only 5400 rpm, not 7200) - at a very good level, an average of almost <b>70Mb / s</b> . <br><br><img src="http://boomburum.ru/wp-content/uploads/2009/09/hdd3.png" alt="image"><br><br><h3>  Working hours </h3><br>  Perhaps this is really the most delicious.  The battery capacity is 8700 mAh, the voltage is 7.2V.  Accordingly, the capacity in watts is 62Wh, and the consumption of the laptop itself is 8.5W! <br>  After a full charge cycle (about 4.5 hours), I had to suffer a lot to ‚Äúkill‚Äù the battery - at 50% backlight (brightness is adjustable from 5 to 115 cd / m2), without a memory card and without Wi-Fi, with ASUS Super technology turned on Hybrid Engine I spent at the working screen about 8 hours!  I think those 9+ hours are meant when the power saving mode is on and with minimal backlight.  In any case, it looks like a record.  For comparison, the same EeePC 1000H could barely withstand 3 pairs (one and a half hours each) at the university.  So for fans to write lectures in electronic format, I can safely recommend this netbook. <br><br><img src="http://boomburum.ru/wp-content/uploads/2009/09/111.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  In the Power Saving profile, the BatteryEater test (Reader test) gave 510 minutes, which is equal to the 8.5 hours mentioned above.  In the Super Performance profile (Classic test), the netbook worked 270 minutes (4.5 hours). <br><br><h3>  Advantages and disadvantages </h3><br>  <u><b>Pros</b> :</u> <br>  - Decent equipment (not enough headphones);  case; <br>  - Excellent build quality, durable, scratch resistant; <br>  - Fast processor - sufficient performance for a netbook; <br>  - Comfortable keyboard layout;  matte screen; <br>  - Battery life (up to 9 hours!); <br>  - Price (from 15 thousand). <br><br>  <u><b>Cons</b> :</u> <br>  - Gloss case; <br>  - The keyboard is somewhat "noisy"; <br>  - The display is "blind" in the sun; <br>  - Dimensions and weight slightly more than the "classmates". <br><br><h3>  findings </h3><br>  For me, the critical price bar for a netbook is about 15,000 rubles.  Here the cost got a little higher than the ‚Äúwaterline‚Äù, however, it‚Äôs not a pity to pay extra for such battery life, especially if you consider that you won‚Äôt find something longer lasting for the same money. <br>  A large, high-quality matte screen, a 160GB hard drive (with a light upgrade), an amazing keyboard and a multi-touch touchpad, decent performance - yes, these are also netbook strengths. <br>  For students, the issue of battery life can be considered conditionally resolved - it will definitely be enough for 4 pairs of 1.5 hours each.  So if you type and learn quickly, feel free to take this netbook into service. <br>  If you are satisfied with the appearance and weight, then you can safely not deny yourself the pleasure - this netbook will not disappoint. <br><br>  <b>Successes!</b> <br>  <i>¬© Boomburum, 2009, specially for <b><a href="http://trendclub.ru/">Trend Club</a></b> &amp; Habrahabr.ru</i> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/68768/">https://habr.com/ru/post/68768/</a></p>
