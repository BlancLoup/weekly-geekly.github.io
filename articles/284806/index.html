  <section class="page js-page"><h1>What is it like to be? Conclusions after a year of work</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Hello again! <br><br>  We spend our lives looking for the best for ourselves.  Work is no exception.  I am sure that even someone who already has it is looking for a good / better job. <br><br>  A year ago, I quit a good IT company after working there for 5 years.  I will not give reasons, so as not to be distracted from the topic.  And having issued IP, I became an individual developer (I don‚Äôt specifically say ‚Äúfreelancer‚Äù, because I don‚Äôt like this word).  During this year I managed to draw some conclusions and now I share them with you (I‚Äôll clarify that I will be talking only about remote work): <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><ol><li>  <b>Ponty</b> .  Do not think that if you became an entrepreneur, now everything will be fine and the money will flow like a river.  Stop show off and just work. </li><li>  <b>Uncertainty</b> .  If you think about how to search for projects now, do not worry, read the thematic sites (I constantly read rubyjobs.ru) and you will certainly find something.  The labor market is designed so that 90% of active projects need the help of adequate developers. </li><li>  <b>Nothing lasts forever</b> .  If you joined the project, you do not need to think that it is for a long time.  No matter how "cool" it is, tomorrow it may not be - this is normal.  The permanent state of searching for other projects will become habitual rather quickly. </li><li>  <b>Work on the contract</b> .  In most cases in the project you will work under a contract.  It makes life much easier for the customer, and limits you.  No sick leave, no benefits and other things.  Therefore, if it is important for you to put a filling on a tooth at the expense of the company, then all this is not for you. </li><li>  <b>Communication</b>  The worst thing about this kind of activity is that you are losing the live communication.  Skype, correspondence by mail, etc., all this can not replace you personal communication with the same as you.  By the way, I miss corporate parties very much, because  In the organization in which I worked, corporate events were stunning in their scope and cheerfulness. </li><li>  <b>Workflow</b>  Do not think that now you will work lying on the couch and have fun.  Have pity on your back!  Buy yourself a table, a chair and a large monitor (if you have a laptop). </li><li>  <b>Normalize the working day</b> .  In the morning, you need to quickly get into work, and in the evening, it will also turn off quickly.  If you work for 10-12 hours, it will only adversely affect your performance in the future. </li><li>  <b>The cost of your services</b> .  Here you are not limited to any framework.  Coolly estimate how much your labor costs and negotiate with the customer for this amount.  The main thing is to be honest and first of all to yourself. </li><li>  <b>Payment of projects</b> .  Refuse hourly pay projects.  Accounting for time in this case will take some amount of time and effort.  Try to look for projects with a monthly payment, it will help you to focus on solving the problems of the project, and not on how many hours you have worked there. </li><li>  <b>Invest in yourself</b> .  Try to allocate money and time for books, courses and other activities that will help you to pump your skills.  It is very important! </li><li>  <b>One you - one project</b> .  Never, I repeat, never take on several projects at the same time!  Save your customers' nerves and nerves when you drag out with modifications and break deadlines. </li><li>  <b>Reporting</b> .  If accounting and other statements begin to take away a lot of time and effort, leave this business and find an accountant.  Although for individual entrepreneurs without employees and at the simplified tax system there should be no difficulties. </li></ol><br>  That's all ... I hope that something from the above will be useful for you.  Good luck! </div>
