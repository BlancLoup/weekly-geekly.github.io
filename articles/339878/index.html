What's left overs</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"><p>  <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/users/aleshqqa1337/" class="user_link">aleshqqa1337</a> in the publication <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/post/339022/">Uneducated youth</a> raises a very important question, the teacher <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/users/pavelmstu/" class="user_link">PavelMSTU</a> gives an <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/post/339208/">exhaustive answer to it</a> .  However, judging by the comments, many do not see the situation as a whole.  Moreover, many are not able to notice the obvious. </p><br><p>  Most of us are insufficiently educated and do not even notice it.  Due to the lack of culture and holistic perception of the world, we are scattered on the irrelevant.  We pay attention to the methods, tools (one of which is money) - anything, but not Life itself! </p><br><p>  <em>Cybernetics, system programming, information security, electronics</em> - <u>specialists in each of these areas have an extensive store of knowledge applicable to life in general and to man (as a living object) in particular</u> . </p><br><p>  But it so happened that techies apply their knowledge to technology.  Given that the models and methods they use can be applied much more widely. </p><br><p>  <strong>So what's the problem?</strong> </p><a name="habracut"></a><br><h2 id="kultura-prezhde-vsego">  Culture first </h2><br><p>  The problem is the lack of culture.  Because there is no abstract thinking, but there is a figurative thinking.  And the abstraction is only a separate method of reducing the dimension of the problem being solved, which consists in cutting off what is irrelevant to the solution of the problem. </p><br><p>  But people are introduced into the head, that there is "abstract thinking".  What for?  You will answer this question yourself, if you know the meaning of the word (Latin abstractio - distraction). </p><br><p>  Those who have a sufficient depth of perception are distracted. <br>  Those who are ready to act (read entrepreneurs) - occupy irrelevant. </p><br><p>  The businessman, contrary to the well-established translation "business man", literally translates as "busy man."  And what is he doing?  Making money!  But excuse me, money cannot be an end in itself, <em>money is just a tool</em> . </p><br><p>  This is a response to <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/post/339208/">erroneous</a> <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/post/339208/">opinions</a> <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/post/339208/">in comments</a> whose authors believe that the use of native speech in professional activities is not important. </p><br><p>  In fact, <u>native speech is the basis of understanding</u> !  Let me explain with examples of areas of professional activity described above.  But first, remember the school. </p><br><h2 id="srednyaya-shkola">  secondary school </h2><br><p>  As I explain for techies, let's take an example from mathematics.  There are some numbers that are called <em>real</em> in English, and <em>real</em> in Russian. <br>  <strong>It is very important that we call these numbers in Russian.</strong> </p><br><p>  Because of this, we still remember that <em>there is no reality,</em> but <strong>reality</strong> .  And when someone says <em>"unreal cool"</em> ... <br>  Any <strong>sane person understands that this statement is ridiculous.</strong>  If literally translated "unrealistic", then the phrase will sound rather ridiculous: <em>"invalid is</em> really <em>cool</em> . <em>"</em> </p><br><p>  By the way, I also made a similar mistake when I wanted to give a more vivid example. <br>  Thanks <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/users/lair/" class="user_link">lair</a> , for <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/post/339878/">pointing out the error</a> . </p><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Incorrect example (left for history)</b> <div class="spoiler_text"><p>  For comparison, say <em>"unrealistically cool"</em> and <em>"invalid for cool</em> . <em>"</em>  And compare your feelings.  Feelings are different, despite the fact that <em>Real</em> and <em>Valid</em> are synonymous!  Say <em>"invalid void"</em> sounds ridiculous. </p></div></div><br><p>  The power of native speech is that you <em><strong>understand it</strong></em> .  And you <em>interpret</em> foreign words. </p><br><p>  If a person does not have a depth of perception, then his judgments are superficial.  Perhaps, by saying "unrealistically cool," the man meant routine.  So I would say "unusual", because there is no ... </p><br><h2 id="informacionnaya-bezopasnot">  Information Security </h2><br><p>  A person should be <u>very serious about words and images</u> , because <em>they program</em> his <em>mind and subconscious</em> . </p><br><p>  Often in the discussion of the article related to advertising and / or ad blockers there are discussions about advertising as a phenomenon (good or bad, degree of obsession, etc.). </p><br><p>  But look at it as a technician. </p><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">On the example of advertising in the subway.</b> <div class="spoiler_text"><p>  Man in the morning goes to the subway to work.  He is not yet fully awake.  Advertising in cars at eye level affects his subconscious. </p><br><p>  A man rides the subway in the evening from work.  Since the psyche is overloaded, filtering information is difficult.  And again, advertising in cars at eye level affects the human subconscious. </p><br><p>  A man rides the subway on a day off, he is fresh and full of energy.  Advertising in the car is at eye level, so a person reads what is written in the advertisement.  Advertising affects the mind.  Yes, a person can filter information (and it will have to spend the resources of the body). </p></div></div><br><p>  From the point of view of an IT specialist, <em>advertising</em> is an <strong>attack akin to sql injection</strong> .  A person (who can be considered as a very complex system) is given a certain way prepared information in the hope that this information will be executed as a command. </p><br><p>  When you <strong><em>understand this</em></strong> , no <u>argument in favor of advertising will affect you</u> . </p><br><p>  An example of a dialogue with arguments in favor of advertising: </p><br><pre><code class="python hljs">: ‚Äî   !    ! : ‚Äî        ,      . : ‚Äî -.. ..  ..</code> </pre> <br><p>  The same dialogue, just imagine that you are accepting a software product: </p><br><pre> <code class="python hljs">: ‚Äî     .  ! : ‚Äî     ! : ‚Äî    .. ..   .</code> </pre> <br><p>  To put it mildly, it looks ridiculous. </p><br><h2 id="sistemnoe-programmirovanie">  System Programming </h2><br><p>  The state machine is a convenient model for describing complex systems.  Sitem ... Something familiar, where have I heard this before?  Circulatory system, nervous system ... Man!  <em>Man is a very complex biological system!</em> </p><br><p>  And indeed, the state when you communicate with your beloved people - mother, brother, children is fundamentally different from the state when you go to the gym and beat the face of the sparring partner.  And when you are engaged in creative work, you transfer to the third state, research activity is the fourth, monotonous routine is the fifth, and so on. </p><br><p>  At the same time, <em>we know which states are useful for us and which are harmful</em> .  The state of love and care that parents create for their children, purposefulness and desire to learn - it helps us grow and strengthen. </p><br><p>  Competition, lack of prospects, nervousness - this depresses and affects us destructively. </p><br><p>  Who among us <em>regularly consciously controls our states</em> ?  For example, corrects irritability, humbles anger?  Just see how many people around you swear.  When a person speaks foul language, it is an unhealthy, painful condition of the body. </p><br><p>  It's amazing that articles are written about the "state of flow", about "procrastination."  But at the same time, people do not use <em>the state machine model for self-analysis</em> . </p><br><p>  Since we remembered the "procrastination", let's sort it out.  You already know the method: we <em>translate into our native language, and we use common sense</em> . </p><br><p>  Procrastination - delay, delay.  Why has become relevant in our time? <br>  Because people are not engaged in their tasks.  Instead of setting goals, setting and solving important tasks for him, a person often solves <em>other people's tasks</em> .  To make it possible for a person to solve an <em>alien</em> task, a reward (money) is relied upon, but not too large (otherwise, he may stop solving these tasks). </p><br><p>  Naturally, a <em>person feels it</em> , <em>but</em> since he <em>does not understand</em> , his defensive actions are primitive: to shut out, postpone for later.  But here comes the boss, stimulates (stimulus - a sharp metal tip on the pole, which is driven by a buffalo harnessed to a wagon) and through the "unwilling" person work works. </p><br><p>  Now, remember <em>the state machine</em> .  A person regularly arrives <strong>in a state of solving an alien task</strong> , and <strong>in a state of postponement for later</strong> .  After some time, this person starts to score on their own tasks.  The program is written - the program works. </p><br><p>  At the same time, there are those who claim that prokastination is in fact a bug, but a feature of the psyche.  And in order to use its (psyche) power, you need to purchase a plugin in the form of a book / course on motivation. </p><br><h2 id="kibernetika">  Cybernetics </h2><br><p>  There is such a direction artificial intelligence.  At one time, expert systems were popular in it, which then evolved into multi-agent systems.  In fact, each agent is an expert system in miniature and perhaps a set of any sensors. </p><br><p>  Any believer will tell you what the <em>Creator is doing on Earth through Man</em> . <br>  <strong><em>Does this remind you of a multi-agent system?</em></strong> </p><br><p>  If you are still in doubt, remember that Man making discoveries mostly looks at Nature.  You guessed that for a number of tasks a distributed multi-agent system is more efficient than a centralized expert system?  Good!  And yes, perhaps ... The Creator guessed earlier. </p><br><h2 id="radioelektronika">  Radio electronics </h2><br><p>  Good, multi-agent system.  But how does the Creator get answers from people (read agents)?  For example, Reason Schumann, the main frequency of which corresponds to the frequency of the alpha rhythm of the human brain - 7.83 Hz (state of relaxation, the transition from wakefulness to sleep). </p><br><p>  From the technician‚Äôs point of view, this <em>can be interpreted as follows</em> : the program worked, dumped into the general information bank of the Earth, then performs self-diagnostics (such a hypothesis is expressed, for example, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3DHsnCMT_EYmg">in this report</a> ) and a new cycle of work after awakening. </p><br><p>  The brain is often compared to a computer processor.  And why no one compares the head with the antenna?  Because then you have to admit that under certain conditions, you can transfer thoughts-images directly.  And it does not suit someone. </p><br><h2 id="ne-nado-interpretaciy-tolko-fakty">  No interpretations, only facts </h2><br><p>  According to <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%25A0%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BB%25D0%25B8%25D0%25BA%25D1%2582%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B2%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B5_%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B7%25D0%25BB%25D1%2583%25D1%2587%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B5">Wikipedia</a> </p><br><blockquote>  relic radiation is considered as one of the main confirmations of the Big Bang theory </blockquote><p>  The conclusion about the confirmation of the Big Bang theory is an <u>interpretation of</u> the <u>fact</u> that the <em>whole Universe is filled with electromagnetic waves (read energy)</em> .  It relies on calculations, but it is an <u>interpretation</u> .  And the fact is that the <strong><em>entire Universe is filled with electromagnetic waves (read energy)</em></strong> . </p><br><p>  A good reason to turn to the ancient teachings, which so directly and stated that the <em>entire Universe is permeated with energy</em> . </p><br><h2 id="vmesto-zaklyucheniya">  Instead of conclusion </h2><br><h3 id="istoki-problemy">  Origins of the problem </h3><br><p>  In publications, the <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/post/339208/">response of the teacher</a> , the <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/company/regionsoft/blog/339284/">answer of business</a> shows that problems arise when a person refuses from human greed. </p><br><p>  Teachers do not deduct students, i.e.  afraid to lose funding.  In the end, everyone starts to pick problems. </p><br><p>  Business treats people as instruments (hi HRs) of making a profit.  In the end, everyone starts to pick problems. </p><br><p>  <em>In our university, by the way, we were not afraid to deduct!</em>  <em>The principal teacher could discharge a quarter of the flow.</em>  <em>And the students turned as they could - someone in the academic;</em>  <em>someone PSG and in another university, simpler;</em>  <em>someone on the adjacent paid and / or evening faculty.</em> </p><br><h3 id="dlya-teh-komu-nebezrazlichno">  For those who are not indifferent </h3><br><p>  You, as a technician, have a good base, applicable to the study of life.  Learn to see. </p><br><p>  Natural question: from whom to study?  Well, we - pragmatic techies - are accustomed to learn from professionals. </p><br><p>  <em>... Created in the image and likeness of his ... And the one who follows the Creator's plan through his actions will become like him ...</em> <br>  And in superlatives will become <strong><em>reverend</em></strong> .
