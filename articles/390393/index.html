  <section class="page js-page"><h1>How to excite games interest in the story or a round table Wargaming</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  On February 10, the press center of the MIA of Russia hosted a round table on the topic ‚ÄúHow modern computer games increase the interest of young people in the EAEU countries in history‚Äù.  The organizers of the round table were employees of the companies Russia Today and Park Patriot.  They convened members of the Ministry of Defense of the Russian Federation, representatives of the leadership of the Ministry of Defense of Belarus, employees of the Publishing House Drofa, and even high-ranking comrades from the Wargaming company.  "Vargi" came as creators and publishers of an important product for the education system - World of Tanks. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/579/3f0/2fd/5793f02fd0dd44fa966f0c379032ffc7.jpg"><br><br><a name="habracut"></a>

      Throughout the meeting, many important topics were heard that have been raised in the media and the government for more than a year.  They talked about the necessity of the ‚Äúdomestic product‚Äù, about raising a love for national history, about the importance of military education in the current political situation, etc.  However, turning on the news, you almost every day something like that and hear. <br><br>  There was a quote from Allen Dulles: "We will not be able to defeat Ivan, who went through the crucible of war, but we will be able to deceive Vanya."  The key point lies in the fact that the Soviet mentality can be overcome only by ideology, but by no means brute force.  And today we and our children are playing projects that are steeped in the substitution of historical meaning.  The vast majority of plots explained that the USSR only helped to win the war, and did not break the perfidious German invader.  This is unacceptable if we want to educate the truth of the past in children.  Therefore, the company Wargaming and was invited to the event as a speaker. <br><br>  Employees of ‚ÄúVargov‚Äù told how the project was made, that it was noticed by the Ministry of Defense of Belarus and after that received support from the armed forces.  Regular consultations on equipment, field trips of the latest achievements of the defense industry and other types of interaction helped the game become what it is now and in the period 2008-2010, the project received a new breath, becoming not just a game called Operation Bagration, but the very World of Tanks, which today know more than 150 million people worldwide (such a number of registrations was officially announced in October 2015 at the international exhibition Igromir in Moscow). <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/6a4/87a/887/6a487a8873b14c3c8ed85c80414552d6.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  A member of the Ministry of Defense of Belarus said during the teleconference that if Lenin had been born in the second half of the twentieth century, he probably would have declared today: ‚ÄúThe computer game is the most important art for us‚Äù. <br><br>  It is worth noting that during the round table itself it was not suggested that today's game industry can provide the consumer with not only military-themed games that teach the history of the nation.  There are a number of projects in which the national flavor is affected without the use of hostilities.  The best example is in this case the quest genre. <br><br>  It was also said that there were no drone control courses in the Russian Federation (they complained that Japan and the United States were already teaching this), and also that there was no place to learn from game designers in Russia.  Fortunately, this last statement turned out to be incorrect, because it is not the first year in the country that they offer training in similar professions at once in several educational institutions - on the basis of <a href="http://hsbi.hse.ru/programs/vocational_retraining/menedzhment-igrovykh-internet-proektov/">HSE</a> , in <a href="http://www.realtime.ru/courses/gamedesign-base/">Real Time</a> and in Scrime. <br><br>  Video of the round table is on youtube.  You can see it here: <br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/KfBEayjT9Zs%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700021,15700186,15700190,15700248,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhhl5gy8Ear3hr9K6BHjQXoDNWPBbA" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  The fact of holding such a round table pleases.  If every developer of popular games with high social significance takes part in such events and helps develop such qualities as patriotism, knowledge of history and other cultural values ‚Äã‚Äãin people, the world will clearly become better.  After all, the creator of a high-quality domestic game product, for sure, can tell dozens of useful and educational facts about creating his game, in order to convince high-ranking officials of the usefulness of their game for the culture of the country. <br><br>  From my experience I will say, three years ago playing Allods Online, I felt there the very Russian flavor and the very ‚ÄúRussianness‚Äù for which representatives of the round table fought.  But this is just my personal opinion :-) <br><br>  What do you think?  <b>Write in the comments, what games do you think develop useful qualities and cultural values ‚Äã‚Äãin us?</b> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/390393/">https://habr.com/ru/post/390393/</a></p>
