    <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  MySpace began launching websites in other languages ‚Äã‚Äãabout a year and a half ago.  Currently, there are already 24 sites in 20 countries, in 12 languages, including French, German and Japanese. <br><br>  MySpace has the largest social site in Europe and is the second most popular in Germany and the UK. <br><br>  However, in countries like France, the local social network SkyRock dominates, which controls more than 70 percent of the social networking market.  MySpace is far behind (albeit in second place) with almost 17 percent, according to research company ComScore. <br><br>  Even in the UK, MySpace is under the influence of competitors.  Although MySpace was the most popular network in the UK, according to Nielsen // NetRatings, however, its rival Facebook recently surpassed MySpace by the total number of users.  According to ComScore, the UK is leading the Bebo project. <br><br>  Penetration into the markets of Brazil and India can be very difficult, as in these countries the Orkut network, which is owned by Google, dominates. <br><br>  In Poland, Grono.net has very strong positions with more than 1.3 million registered users.  In Russia, LiveJournal, a blog platform owned by a San Francisco company, stands very firmly on its feet.  Yandex, a local company that dominates the Russian Internet search market, far ahead of Google, owns its own social network, My Circle. <br><br>  ‚ÄúLocal sites like SkyRock will not disappear,‚Äù said Nick Thomas, an analyst at Jupiter Research.  ‚ÄúThe number of social networks in which people want to participate is limited, and the more time local companies have for development, the harder it will be to compete with them.‚Äù <br><br>  Travis Katz, head of the international office of MySpace, recognizes that the expansion will not be easy.  ‚ÄúIn the US, we had four years of odds for starting, but in regions such as Europe, we enter the market with already existing competitors.‚Äù <br><br>  Mr Kratz said that new sites in Brazil, India, Poland and Russia could be unprofitable at the start. <br><br>  ‚ÄúAt first, we launched our projects in countries where we could make money, just like there is a developed online advertising market in these countries.  At the moment, we are coming to countries that are not so developed.  In Russia, for example, there is no well-developed online advertising market.  However, now is the time to enter these markets, because we can capitalize on their growth. ‚Äù <br><br>  Currently there are still many foreign markets to expand. <br><br>  In the US, about 18 percent of Internet users participate in social networks.  In Europe, for example, only 14 percent. <br><br>  From the translator (that is, from me): This is how gentlemen are.  Our online market is becoming more popular. <br><br>  PS: I can't transfer to translations.  Writes the following: <br><blockquote>  You can write to this collective blog only after joining it. </blockquote><br>  What is it for? </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/15061/">https://habr.com/ru/post/15061/</a></p>
