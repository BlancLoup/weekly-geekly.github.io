Moreover, my path was not at all <b>Raiffeisen ‚Üí Alfa-Bank ‚Üí VTB24</b> .  I use the VTB24 card in parallel, but rarely. </p><br><p>  So, on banks: <a name="habracut"></a>  <b>Raiffeisen:</b> </p><br><p><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/a06/38f/d62/a0638fd622904f11bdf1e404ffb589af.png" align="left">  Dear Habrakhabrovtsy, who began to comment on whether I am right or wrong in challenging.  In general, I immediately wrote that it is possible and wrong.  But the case is quite extraordinary, and on whose side the IPU would stand in arbitration is still a big question. </p><br><p>  And I remember exactly what my message was simply ignored - ‚Äúwe tried to call you all day‚Äù.  If I could clearly explain why they believe that I will lose the challenge to the transaction, and whether I want to try anyway, is a completely different question.  When Raiffeisen really wants to call, then you receive a call from the robot that asks you to stay on the line from 9-10 am until the operator answers you to conduct a survey.  Agree - it just shows the attitude to the client! </p><br><p>  <b>Alfa Bank</b> </p><br><p><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/913/f89/875/913f8987545c4ba0a64d770f13ddd599.png" align="left">  Yes, I completely agree that I have not read the tariffs myself.  Just for me it's a relic of the 90s.  A bank is a financial institution that makes money to its shareholders from the contributions that people carry to them.  The bank can invest my money in construction or give loans.  And when I hear that I still have to pay a commission of 5% for withdrawing money - this is just something fantastic.  Say thank you for keeping my money with you.  Those.  held) </p><br><p>  <b>VTB 24</b> </p><br><p><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/a37/936/db3/a37936db33d049388aa86c3fc4f9bad4.png" align="left">  Of course, I myself can walk to the ATM and turn on SMS confirmation and 3D-Secure, if possible.  Only here, 3D-Secure was invented not at all to protect the cardholder, by the way, as written on the website of the same VTB24, but to protect retail outlets from friendly fraud. </p><br><p>  You probably know that it is extremely difficult to challenge a password-prone transaction on the website of the issuing bank (3DS - we have sms), as fraudulent.  But if the channel of the store is 3D-Secure, and the card does not support this technology, then you will win 99% of the challenge (if the bank wants to start it).  And VTB24 itself (that is, the issuer) will pay for fraud, and not the acquirer bank (as is the case with the non-3DS channel).  This is beautiful in English called the liability shift - the shift of responsibility from the acquirer to the issuer when using 3D-Secure technology. </p><br><p>  Those.  in fact, it is epic fail on the part of VTB24.  Issue cards that can literally damage the bank. </p><br><p>  As for the ‚Äúcard fraud‚Äù insurance sold in Russia - I, in general, believe that this is pure fraud: </p><br><ol><li><p>  There are rules of the Ministry of Railways that banks must comply with, and in them the procedure for challenging and the timing is clearly regulated.  The problem here is if the bank does not follow the rules that you cannot complain to Visa / MasterCard.  Only the participants of the IPU (banks) can complain. </p><br></li><li>  After all, banks have made such an imperfect system as a magnetic stripe, which until now is even on chip cards.  Why should the cardholder pay for the security bounds of their system?  After all, you are already putting money into accounts, and banks earn using this money. </li></ol><br><p>  The American legislator understood this as early as 74 in the <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/company/chronopay/blog/280480/">Fair Credit Billing Act</a> . </p><br><p>  We, of course, also have a law <a href="http://www.consultant.ru/document/cons_doc_LAW_115625/b0062cfb1c3cae710d57f0557303e78760a31d16/">161 FZ, part 9, item 11,</a> which is written very crookedly and gives you a whole <b>day</b> , to the message about a fraudulent card transaction.  Of course there is also <a href="http://www.consultant.ru/document/cons_doc_LAW_9027/50e48126d20fd763008466e35f8f21f22fb66ce7/">Article 854 of the Civil Code of the Russian Federation</a> , if you remember that each card is tied to an account. </p><br><p>  As I said our law says that in case of card fraud, you have 1 (one!) Day to declare it (as opposed to 60 days in the US).  And the bank must either prove that the cardholder actually made the payment, or refund the transaction amount. </p><br><p>  The lack of judicial practice and the violation of the rules of the IPU by banks also leads to the fact that some banks on operations with a magnetic stripe in the offline line equate the pincode to a handwritten signature.  While from the point of view of the IPU, the operation is easily challenged and the money is returned.  Unlike EMV operations with pincode input. </p><br><p>  After all, the magnetic stripe is very simply copied, after which a duplicate card is made and with your money they pay for purchases in the store, or simply withdraw them from an ATM. </p><br><p>  In America, this is all overgrown with jurisprudence and resulted in Zero Liability, which is publicly stated by the IPU, and do not sell you insurance. </p><br><p>  And I repeat once again: when will it reach even one bank that whoever gives the market the very first <a href="https://www.visa.com/chip/personal/security/zero-liability.jsp">Zero Liability</a> will conquer the issue market in Russia! </p></div>
