  <section class="page js-page"><h1>How I went to the Android Market</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  There have already been several articles about the first steps on the market, and each is of interest.  Anyway, from me.  And I thought that it would not be superfluous to share a banal, in general, a story about another case.  I‚Äôm not going to promote my application in this article, but I‚Äôm going to talk about some aspects of the project‚Äôs life in the first month and how to promote it, accessible to everyone.  Well, some lyrics, of course ... <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h5>  Prehistory </h5><br>  It all started with the fact that friends gave me a google phone Nexus S. This device I was very interested in - before that I used the ASUS P500 mobile bricks wines.  Immediately began to try anything.  I liked how the market is organized.  And I decided - it is imperative that I write something and push it there.  The main doubt was the fact that most of the obvious and simple ideas have already been implemented.  On the other hand, I was inspired by the fact that there is such a heap of junk and sludge on the market that at least any decent application can look at all. <br><br>  Another factor that unexpectedly led me to the market was my enthusiasm for physical education.  It‚Äôs not that I succeed in any sport, quite the opposite.  But I do it diligently.  And, due to the fact that I am no longer 18 years old, I try to keep track of my weight.  Earlier, about 7 years ago, he wrote in a notebook.  Then he began to enter in Excel.  After getting the google phone, I downloaded the program for this, the most popular one.  And something she did not look to me - too much superfluous, but the one to which I was accustomed, the tablet in eksel, absolutely not.  Eureka!  I thought.  I will write a program for myself.  Realizing perfectly well that there is darkness on the same market, there is no talk about any innovative idea, and in general the prospects for the popularity of the project are most likely none, I set to work. <br><br>  Writing for android turned out to be interesting and relatively simple - they didn‚Äôt invent even more bulky frameworks.  That's for me, I'm used to programming in PL \ SQL, where everything is primitive, simple and accessible.

      After the program began to work, it's time to think about its appearance.  I hired a designer, and I was made quite a beautiful (in my opinion) design according to my interface concept.  I even managed to pull it on the program.  I tested it personally, and for quite some time.  Therefore, as soon as the design appeared, he immediately happily laid out his creation on the market, making a description in Russian and English. <br><br><h5>  Week one </h5><br>  Put it laid out, but how will people know about it?  The first thing that came to mind - write on the forums.  What he did, in Russian and English.  Since the ultimate goal of my existence is to transfer all petrodollars back from abroad to Russia, I initially focused on a foreign client.  But something in my foreign forums didn‚Äôt show much interest in my work - only one did not disappoint: <a href="http://www.androidforums.com/">www.androidforums.com</a> . <br><br>  Of ours, the program has caused some interest on google-androids.ru, w3bsit3-dns.com, androidfan.ru.  There I also laid out the application, not sorry. <br><br>  I immediately hooked up an AirPush ad to the application, which is hated by many.  Perhaps especially zealous haters will now put a minus and close the article.  But, analyzing the situation, I decided that I needed AirPush.  There is nowhere to place advertising in the application itself, it will spoil the view, and people use it for three seconds a day - no one will poke into advertising.  Put one advertising message per week, it's not so scary, in my opinion. <br><br>  As people downloaded the program, there were requests from users: export / import from CSV was implemented, two bugs were fixed.  In my topics on these forums, I sometimes wrote something, I even exchanged emails with one foreign user - he sent me a CSV from an old program with which he crawled onto mine, and I made a downloader based on this format.  True, then un learned that I had Airpush, put 1 instead of 5 on the market and angrily wrote about it on the forum.  Bourgeois damn. <br><br>  Posting on forums and supporting topics at the top of the list has had some effect.  As can be seen from the diagram, Users from Russia were the most active - I think the point is in the forums. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/45b/83c/8da/45b83c8dae25a518f11cb4e1bb8f046b.png"><br><br><h5>  Second week </h5><br><br>  For several days I disregarded my project.  As a result, the number of active users according to Google statistics began to grow much as slowly.  A few days later I added Chinese to the market ‚Äî at first, only the name was translated, and downloads from Taiwan started, as can be seen in the diagram. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/4d4/9bf/e89/4d49bfe890b51868eaa9d178308c8618.png"><br><br>  And here I understood - adding languages ‚Äã‚Äãis important.  But while the plan was different: it was decided to check the effect of the publication of paid reviews.  On November 8, a review was published on <a href="http://www.androiddevelopmenttalk/">www.androiddevelopmenttalk</a> .  I already knew in advance that this is garbage, and I‚Äôm unlikely to add more downloads to my project.  The site sometimes just lay.  Do not use his services, $ 25 spent in vain. <br><br>  The 11th of November published a review on <a href="http://www.androidapplog.com/">www.androidapplog.com</a> .  No results.  Another 36 dollars in worthless expenses.  However, a negative result is also a result, and I can save some money for the readers. <br><br><h5>  Third week </h5><br><br>  It became clear that it was necessary to develop a theme with languages.  They made a translation into French, promised (still not done, ordered for money - soon will be) transfers into Korean and German.  For the rest of the languages, I filled in the information with automatic translation.  By the way, Koreans are superactive users of android, in my category of applications they are the second after the USA, keep in mind.  After these manipulations, there was an increase in the number of active users, which was what was required to prove.  Especially happy Taiwan, thank you friend for the translation.  Apparently, the name successful for the search turned out. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/542/ce9/272/542ce927297f9c0abeb7d5adce37d31a.png"><br><br><h5>  Fourth week last </h5><br><br>  In the last week of the experiment, it was decided to try the most common way to promote an application - paid advertising.  We estimate the budget - 136 dollars.  In this case, the cost of the entire project as a whole will become a tidy 10,000 rubles. <br><br>  On the market in the developer section there is a link - advertise the application.  Go there, <br>  getting to adMob.  Choose 4 days, from 2011-11-22 to 2011-11-25, at $ 34 per day.  AdMob allows you to choose the geography of the service.  In order not to disgrace the autotranslated text, I select countries with languages ‚Äã‚Äãfor which there is currently an adequate translation: English, Chinese, French.  Russians will not show ads, we will regret. <br><br>  Demographic filters do not set, show all age groups and sexes. <br>  Next, adMob offers to choose a bid.  This is the cost per click.  It turns out that if you put 9 cents, then there will be 400 clicks on advertising per day.  Earn millions will not work, but you can estimate the effect. <br><br>  After going through all the stages of creating a campaign, we get to the adMob page, where a new campaign is visible, <br>  the ability to edit it, and the subtle inscription that we have no money. <br>  Click ‚Äúadd funds‚Äù, and pay via Google checkout - everything is simple and convenient. <br><br>  The truth is that on 22.11 at 00:00 my campaign did not start - the status of pending for approval is calm <br>  hung in the plate on the site.  I read on the forums - people tend to complain about the long term confirmation campaigns.  Without hesitation, I wrote to the support - suddenly it speeds up the process.  After the second letter, the support started after four days.  I decided to spend all the money in one day, and not stretch them for a few - it would be easier to evaluate the effect.  They flew away in half an hour.  Here is a picture: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/b29/8c5/4aa/b298c54aa73181a85543bdb90f55fe0b.png"><br><br>  The effect was what can be seen on the chart active downloads.  Surprisingly, the effect lasted two days, although the campaign took half an hour.  But it is quite small, out of 1500 clicks - a maximum of 100 additional installations, or even less.  It is unlikely to ever pay off.  The conclusion is appropriate. <br><br>  Here is a chart of active downloads from Google: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/987/017/201/987017201cbef16b20faf25b445a9c5d.png"><br><br>  And country statistics <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/a74/3be/f95/a743bef956462a882f24f32106682b8c.png"><br><br><h5>  Summary </h5><br>  Summing up this small experiment, I want to say that it is also fascinating - to follow the fate of my own, albeit microscopic, project.  He still does not bring money ($ 10 per month is not money).  Let's see what will happen next. <br><br><h5>  Conclusion </h5><br>  1. Even a simple application has a chance for someone to download it and start using it.  But make sure that it is necessary for someone, do something that you yourself or someone you know would use. <br>  2. Promotion of free applications - the task is not entirely clear.  Investing money in advertising and paid reviews is pointless.  There are forums left. <br>  3. The best way to increase the number of users is to make translations of descriptions in the market into different languages.  It is desirable that the name was simple and clear, and suitable for the search conditions.  If you make an alarm clock, and call it Daisy, users who are hardly looking for an alarm clock will meet your creation.  Well, automatic translation does not always rule.  I was obviously lucky with Taiwan, but it is clear that France is a little bit overtaking other European countries. <br>  4. This is not reflected in the article, but I will say post-Fatum: the project site is not very important if there is no need for a large manual.  Attendance of the blog page, where I made a description and where I referred from the market, was not significant. <br><br>  That's it. <br>  You can view the application here: <a href="https://market.android.com/details%3Fid%3DAndroid.WeightLog">market.android.com/details?id=Android.WeightLog</a> <br><br><h5>  PS About the unexpected effect of the publication on Habr√© </h5><br>  Two days have passed since the placement of the article.  It is evident that the people became interested in the application, although, I repeat: I did not have a goal to promote it, a note about something else.  I am glad that many were interested in the subject, it can be seen from the comments and messages in personal mail.  Also, thanks to the guys who added positive ratings on the market - a trifle, but nice.  Although, I repeat: the purpose of publishing this program on the market is to study the operation of the system, which I wrote about. <br>  On the other hand, there were amazing people: perhaps, of those who were mined in kamentah, or maybe just in life dissatisfied.  Or not with a habr (but then this is an amazing coincidence).  So here, instructed units - do not like our people that there AirPush.  Although I warned that he was there.  Reviews like "the program does not work" in general beyond good and evil, because  it still works. <br>  In general - the people are amazing to do filth, I do not understand. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/133688/">https://habr.com/ru/post/133688/</a></p>
