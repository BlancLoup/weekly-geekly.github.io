But most people do not understand this.  They put off making decisions indefinitely, not realizing the fact that they have the ability to make life-changing decisions.  So, how to jump over this ‚Äúwall of resistance‚Äù?  Successful leaders around the world have developed decision making skills, and this is how they do it. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h4>  They plan well. </h4><br>  A clear plan with precise and clear deadlines sends a powerful signal to both your consciousness and the subconscious.  He says: "Hey, you need to do the work, so don't waste your time on all sorts of nonsense."  It helps you focus on the most important tasks.  In this situation, it is unlikely even a single glance to look at the news feed on Facebook. <br><br>  By working this way, you force yourself to move in simple and short steps, speeding up and completing your task.  Thanks to this tactic, you will be able to make decisions automatically, it will also help you overcome your need for procrastination and create a clear workflow.

    <h4>  They do not meditate - they just begin to act. </h4><br>  During planning, the head can spin from the seemingly fantastic goals.  It is important to know exactly when it is worth stopping to plan and move on to action.  The endless hours spent planning a plan will lead you to nothing if you stay in the planning area for too long. <br><br>  If you want the work done, it is important to start.  Do not wait until a wonderful idea falls on your head.  Act little by little - but don't stand still. <br><br>  <i>You do not need to develop the most complex plan in the world.</i>  <i>You just need to start.</i> <br><br><h4>  They go to the goal in huge steps. </h4><br>  After you take a small step, it's time to make a big one.  And even better - to quickly gain momentum and rush c cosmic speed.  The world is changing very quickly, and you just can not afford to slowly respond to change. <br><br>  <i>Therefore, successful leaders love to act.</i> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/784/7f0/bda/7847f0bdae7b4f229216a1b8d55c0a5e.png"><br><br>  Take into consideration any successful company, and you will be amazed by its speed.  They fly forward at the speed of lightning, crushing and inventing something new every day and releasing products at the right moment. <br><br>  <i>This will not happen if you go to the goal with childish small steps - you need to jump and jump as far as possible.</i> <br><br><h4>  They turn a soft "I should" into a hard "I have to." </h4><br>  When you think that you ‚Äúshould‚Äù do something, the fuse is lost before work begins.  On the other hand, when you say that you ‚Äúneed‚Äù to do something, the energy around is transformed, and enthusiasm returns to you. <br><br>  The phrase ‚ÄúI should‚Äù makes the work a burden, while the phrase ‚ÄúI should‚Äù makes it a priority. <br><br>  <i>Soft questioning leads to delay, and tough - to action.</i> <br><br>  Changing ‚Äúshould‚Äù to ‚Äúshould‚Äù may seem an unconvincing method to you, but it brings huge changes in attitude to work, pushing you to action.  Why not test this tactic on yourself? <br><br><h4>  They know when to listen to the mind, and when - the heart. </h4><br>  Many say that you need to listen to the heart, not the mind.  But often the decisions made by the heart are too emotional and can lead to serious consequences.  So in the end you can regret their impulsive decisions. <br><br>  <i>Do not focus on the heart or mind - use them "in a bundle."</i>  <i>Hold the balance.</i> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/b63/5b0/e37/b635b0e37f18439fbafd994c09336466.png"><br><br>  Great leaders know when to empathize, and when to exercise rigor.  When to console, and when - to get angry.  In this and all the difference. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/293708/">https://habr.com/ru/post/293708/</a></p>
