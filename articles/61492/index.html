  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Results of the week: Reader and fragments of Gmail</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  All past week, wrote the seventh chapter on <a href="http://reader.google.com/">Google Reader</a> .  Goes surprisingly difficult.  For the past five days, written to the insulting little - only 17 thousand characters.  And this is despite the fact that I usually try to comply with the established daily rate of 8 thousand.  The reason is that I use far from all the capabilities of the Reader - I practically don‚Äôt read messages shared by ‚Äúfriends‚Äù and haven‚Äôt been looking for channels for a long time using the ‚ÄúView materials‚Äù option.  I have certain reading habits, according to which my aggregator works like a long-established mechanism that does not require lubrication.  And in the book you need to try to make the description of functions wider in order not to make the narration similar to the singing of the akyn.  Therefore, I sit, experiment, try on myself. <a name="habracut"></a><br>  About editing.  How useful is a fresh look!  How useful happens after a couple of days to see what you have written!  How many stupid mistakes and self-replays are found are amazing.  I wonder how much the quality of writing improves over time?  Do problems with word matching and building applications go away?  Time will tell. <br>  As an experiment, I will lay out a small fragment of the first chapter of the Gmail service.  If it seems to me and readers successful - I will continue.  Comments on the style and content are greatly appreciated. <br><br>  <strong>Acquaintance.</strong> <br>  Revolutionary (I feel that the author will use this word on the pages of the book more than once) the Gmail postal service saw the light of the day on April 1, 2004.  Despite the festive atmosphere of the day of laughter, the new mail was not a joke, but at first it was really hard to believe in its capabilities: work only through the web interface, the lack of folders, some strange stars, shortcuts, and ... a whole gigabyte of storage space mail!  For the now distant two thousand and fourth, such a volume was unthinkable - no joke, the most generous offers of other free services did not exceed one hundred megabytes!  All that exceeded the limit was necessary to delete from the server.  And Gmail already on its homepage offered to refuse to delete letters and at first there was no ‚ÄúDelete‚Äù button at all in the interface, it was added some time later ‚Äúat the request of the workers‚Äù.  A year after the launch of the service, the bar for storing letters was raised once again, and since then it no longer stops - the user-accessible space counter is spinning, not stopping for a second, and now Gmail users have access to about 8 gigabytes. <br>  However, this innovation is not over.  Instead of the usual folders in which you could put messages, Google engineers decided to use shortcuts.  The main difference of this approach is the ability to ‚Äúattach‚Äù several tags to one message.  What is convenient?  Any message thus acquires as if several dimensions, now they can be selected and viewed according to different criteria.  Below you will see for yourself that the new approach is very convenient and effective. <br>  But let's start from the beginning.  Enter in the address bar of the browser <a href="http://www.gmail.com/">www.gmail.com</a> , admire the welcome message, specify the account name, password ... and here we are in front of the main page: <br><img title="english_screen3" src="http://gappsbook.ru/wp-content/uploads/english_screen3-600x313.jpg" alt="english_screen3" width="600" height="313"><br><br>  How is your English?  Speak English?  Oh, not so?  Then I propose to switch the application language to a great and powerful one without saving time - save yourself a lot of time.  Personally, I use the English version for one reason - all innovations are first tested on the English-language interface and only some time later spread it to all the languages ‚Äã‚Äãof the world (Google applications, by the way, are translated into more than 40 languages, including such exotic for us as Arabic and Hindi ).  And I really love the new items!  However, in order to switch to the native speech, you need to go to the Setup menu, located in the upper right corner of the screen and on the General tab, in the Languge item, select Russian, and then press the Save button.  The main screen will change: <br><img title="russian_screen1" src="http://gappsbook.ru/wp-content/uploads/russian_screen1-600x356.jpg" alt="russian_screen1" width="600" height="356">

      The first thing you should pay attention to is the list of messages.  Surely you don‚Äôt have too many of them, but if you pay attention to the heading of any of them, you will surely notice that besides the actual subject of the letter there is also a short fragment of the message itself.  In addition to the formal ‚ÄúHello!‚Äù, In the heading, it‚Äôs very convenient to see the coveted sequel: ‚ÄúCould you please take me a little more money ...‚Äù and, without reading further, send the letter to the basket :) By the way, deleted letters lie in the basket for exactly thirty days , then completely removed. <br>  All incoming messages to you by default (that is, unless otherwise noted) go to the "Inbox" section.  What can be done by seeing a new letter there?  Well, firstly you can select it using a small flag to the left of the message.  You can perform various actions on one or several messages selected in a similar way - for example, send them to the archive (Pressing the ‚ÄúArchive‚Äù button, as you might guess), Cart (Move to - Basket) or complain the system to intrusive advertising messages (Move to - Spam) <br>  To the left of each letter is a star symbol.  Clicked on it, and the asterisk caught fire.  Pressed again - went out.  Guys, here are the stars!  The fact is that they can mark completely arbitrary messages.  And for what purposes, everyone decides for himself.  Personally, in my daily work I single out letters that require an answer, but not now, but a little later ‚Äî this approach allows us not to stop and look at more messages for one approach, while not forgetting the important one.  There can be any number of ‚Äústar‚Äù applications - the main thing is that then all the letters gifted with a yellow pentagram can be easily selected with the help of the ‚ÄúMarked *‚Äù item located exactly under the ‚ÄúInbox‚Äù section.  When the time comes, I go to the "star" section and answer the accumulated questions. <br><br><img title="starred2" src="http://gappsbook.ru/wp-content/uploads/starred2-600x333.jpg" alt="starred2" width="600" height="333"><br>  Click on the message header.  Now it can finally be read in its entirety.  Oh, new buttons!  While you are reading a letter from the Gmail developers (it is the very first in the list), I‚Äôll tell you why they are all needed. <br><br>  ... <br>  (To be continued) <br>  PS You can follow the developments on the site of the book <a href="http://gappsbook.ru/">GAppsBook.ru</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/61492/">https://habr.com/ru/post/61492/</a></p>
