  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Hackathon in deep learning</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Deep learning is rapidly developing, and the list of new breakthroughs and areas of its application ( <a href="http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~fritz/absps/imagenet.pdf">image processing</a> , <a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/roberthof/2013/05/01/meet-the-guy-who-helped-google-beat-apples-siri/">speech recognition</a> , <a href="https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~vmnih/docs/dqn.pdf">reinforcement training</a> , <a href="http://104.131.78.120/">neuromachine translation</a> , computational pharmaceuticals <a href="http://blog.kaggle.com/2012/10/31/merck-competition-results-deep-nn-and-gpus-come-out-to-play/">1</a> and <a href="http://www.bioinf.jku.at/publications/2014/NIPS2014a.pdf">2</a> and further) is steadily growing.  As a result, the world's largest IT companies (Google, Facebook, Baidu, and many others) continue to actively implement deep learning technologies, creating new jobs. <br><br>  In the meantime, the illusion persistently supported by journalists arises that technology of deep learning is about to solve the problem of creating artificial intelligence [ <a href="http://www.technologyreview.com/view/538431/deep-learning-machine-beats-humans-in-iq-test/">1</a> , <a href="http://www.technologyreview.com/view/537101/deep-learning-machine-solves-the-cocktail-party-problem/">2</a> , <a href="http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/is-deep-learning-a-revolution-in-artificial-intelligence">3</a> , <a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/anthonykosner/2014/12/29/tech-2015-deep-learning-and-machine-intelligence-will-eat-the-world/">4</a> ].  But the reality is that the range of unsolved problems will suffice for many more theses (see the <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/0BxKBnD5y2M8NVHRiVXBnOVpiYUk/view%3Fsle%3Dtrue">presentation of</a> J. Lekun (Yann LeCun) on CVPR15, <a href="http://people.idsia.ch/~juergen/naturedeepmind.html">note by</a> J. Schmidth√ºber, <a href="http://wp.goertzel.org/google-deepminds-new-video-game-ai/">post by</a> B. Goertzel), already mentioned in the <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/259191/">article</a> on Habr√© <a href="http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~fritz/absps/transauto6.pdf">by</a> J. Hinton (Geoffrey Hinton)).  Aware of this fact, specialists in machine learning seek to improve their skills;  As an indicator, this year there were more than 600 applications for 100 places in the <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/deeplearningsummerschool/">summer school</a> for in-depth training by Yoshua Bengio (Yoshua Bengio). <br><br>  Probably, not many of Habr's readers had the opportunity to get to the school of Y. Bengio, however, it will be possible to gain experience and knowledge of in-depth training during an intensive weekly competition (hakaton), which will be held in Moscow in July.  The hackathon participants will have the opportunity to listen to lectures from the world's leading experts, put their skills into practice and win prizes. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/cb1/2df/836/cb12df836579401c9b20b65ae39058ee.png">

    <a name="habracut"></a><br>  The event will be held on the basis of the Moscow Institute of Physics and Technology from July 19 to 25 and with the support of many companies (see pictures on the website), and senior students, graduate students, young scientists and professionals of the IT industry from all over Russia are invited to attend.  To participate in the hackathon will be selected from 30 to 50 people, who will gather in teams of 3-4 people. <br><br>  The main goals of the hackathon are: to unite people interested in machine learning and the problem of AI, in an intensive mode to obtain modern knowledge and practically apply them in an attempt to break world records. <br><br>  The teams will be assigned the task of developing an algorithm capable of independently learning to play any of the retro computer games Atari.  This formulation is determined by the fact that one of the most promising areas in the field of AI is the construction of neural network algorithms that can not only ‚Äúrecognize‚Äù, but also ‚Äúunderstand‚Äù.  In January of this year, the DeepMind team (Google) published <a href="http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v518/n7540/full/nature14236.html">an article</a> in the prestigious scientific journal Nature, in which the best global result in developing a universal reinforcement learning algorithm was obtained using deep learning.  This is just one of the first steps on the way to neural networks that are able to control the environment around them and at the same time learn. <br><br>  The participants will be helped by the world's leading experts who will read a series of lectures on the latest achievements in machine learning at MIPT (live and remote).  See the list of lecturers on the hakaton website, and what they will be telling about is usually already on their personal pages. <br><br><h5>  Brief schedule of the event </h5><br>  Sunday: participants gathering, organizational meeting, team building, setting up the environment, introductory lecture, and the first nightly launch of the calculation. <br><br>  Monday-Friday: discussion of intermediate results, programming of new solutions developed in a team, lectures, launching calculations. <br><br>  After a week of development, teams whose algorithms will show the best results will participate in the final tournament ‚ÄúHack the Game!  Day ‚Äù, which will be held July 25 on Saturday at the site of the Polytechnic Museum at ENEA.  And, of course, the winning teams will be awarded prizes. <br><br>  ‚ÄúHack the Game!  Day ‚Äùis planned as an open holiday for all interested in games and artificial intelligence.  On it, the best teams will present their results to visitors and tell you what algorithms these results were obtained with, and visitors will be able to compete with team bots. <br><br>  Applications for participation in the hackathon DeepHack.Game are accepted until July 1, 2015. <br><br>  All participants will be provided with <b>accommodation and computing resources</b> .  But you need to bring your laptop with you. <br></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/260795/">https://habr.com/ru/post/260795/</a></p>
