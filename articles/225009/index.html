      Of course, the first question will be: ‚ÄúWhy all this?  There are already thousands of such devices on the market, why reinvent the wheel? ‚ÄùOf course, we ourselves would not have decided to enter this market if it were not for one Chinese customer.  His main wish is a quality picture in any weather during the day and especially at night.  We have no restrictions on sales to other countries, therefore we want to take into account as many wishes as possible. <br><br>  So, customer requirements: <br>  1. Price no more than $ 300 <br>  2. Sensor resolution not less than 1920x1080 and 30 frames per second <br>  3. Built-in 3G modem, GPS, G-sensor, WiFi. <br>  4. Record on microSD up to 128 Gb. <br>  5. Constant connection to the external server through OpenVPN, for transfer of coordinates and video on demand. <br>  6. Connectors for external antennas 3G, WiFi, GPS. <br>  7. Built-in Li-polymer battery to keep the entire system running for at least 2 hours at full load.  (4000mAh with a large margin) <br><br>  That's all, the rest - at our discretion.  The deadlines are very tight, we have to issue working samples in mid-July.  What we came to this time: <br><br>  1. Decided on optics and a sensor.  The main factors affecting the quality of night shooting are the sensitivity of the sensor and the aperture of the lens.  It makes no sense to chase megapixels, if you need decent quality at night.  Therefore, we take the most sensitive matrix FHD size 1 / 2.8 mm, SONY - or IMX122, or IMX136.  Lenses used on almost all DVRs are in M12 format, whose luminosity is rarely below F2.  After talking with the engineer of one of the optical factories, we realized that it was impossible to make the lens aperture F1.2 in this format.  Therefore, we decided to put the CS connector under the external lens and at the same time ordered it at the factory with a focal length of 2.7 mm.  Using the lens F1.2, we will receive light twice as much as from F2, which means that under the same conditions there will be less exposure and sharper frames.  And, of course, do not forget about the IR filter, which is completely unnecessary at night, and absorbs as much as 30% of the light.  Therefore, we put the mechanical. <br><br>  2. Due to the tight deadlines, it was not possible to switch to a faster processor, <br>  I had to leave the TI DM368, as in all of our cameras.  In the following installments, we change it to DM369, DM369 = DM368 + good shumodav.  The sensors, by the way, will also be the new IMX236, they are more sensitive in the IR range. <br><br>  3. The manufacturer of the 3g modems was recommended by the customer, this is what he is: <br><br><table><tbody><tr><td><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/dd2/076/ce2/dd2076ce2e9a700728bdbf828b2c671c.jpg" width="400"></td><td><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/a06/fd0/86e/a06fd086e51031d4a04066e2a674c981.jpg" width="400"></td></tr></tbody></table><br><br>  On the same GPS and G-sensor board.  All software from Qualcomm is completely closed, and, fortunately, the manufacturer is familiar with the DM368 and has already begun to collect binaries for us.  So we wait, when will issue. <br><br>  4. Now about the design.  In haste it turned out this: <br>  Dimensions: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/231/31e/9d0/23131e9d034af50989cab7e92ac35aca.jpg"><br><br>  They took the mount for now from GoPro: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/c60/619/110/c6061911046e7637a94ea4d4b207bf9e.jpg"><br><br>  The back wall, there will still be a button POWER: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/ede/112/f53/ede112f53e27097cd7446010a7adb659.jpg"><br><br>  View from above: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/fe6/46b/97f/fe646b97ff39cab559255c6d6599252e.jpg"><br><br>  Bottom view, as long as there is no other external connector for WiFI, we plan to make two options - with integrated and external GPS: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/b49/dba/176/b49dba1763e0a8dd866a2df9cd29617c.jpg"><br><br>  That's all.  We would like to take into account as many wishes as possible. <br>  did not launch samples into production.  Knowing the registrar users love to change the firmware, we make all the software completely free, not counting the closed 3G modem or Qualcomm.
