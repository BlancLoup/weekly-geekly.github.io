  <section class="page js-page"><h1>About choosing PC configuration</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  As the flow of people who want advice on how to build a good computer for reasonable money is increasing, I want to share information about how I choose computers for myself and my friends.  Perhaps, thus, it will be possible to send these friends to this publication, which will save a little time, both for me and for them. <br>  Actually, it's just :) Trying to algorithmize my way of selecting components.  <b>It doesn't matter where to start, the main thing is to come</b> (in our case - to make a configuration).  It is appropriate to recall such a truth in the selection of PC, as the <i>recursiveness of</i> choice.  The choice of iron consists of 3 parts ‚Äî the choice itself, the evaluation of the configuration obtained and, sometimes, the recursion ‚Äî a return to the previous stage and the selection of another iron.  Therefore, for simplicity, start with something, and the chain will come to <i>its</i> configuration.  I often wondered - ‚ÄúWhy do they start the choice with the processor and end with the power supply?‚Äù It turned out that the answer is simple - because the processor was heard most of all, and what the power supply is - some people don‚Äôt even imagine ... I hope you are not one of those;) So let's get started <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h4>  Selection technique </h4><br>  Often, the basic requirements for a PC are known initially - what opportunities the PC should provide, and, of course, the number of banknotes allocated to this computer.  Recently, it is also the noise level, it should be at an acceptably low level. <br>  Thus, we first choose a specific configuration for this money, we look at what happened, what can be improved, what is a painless cut.  It is also useful to make several configurations for the same money - this will help you determine what is more important for you in your future build. <br>  Let me remind you that any computer consists of a monitor, a system unit, a keyboard and a mouse.  I will not consider the choice of keyboard and mouse, for these are too specific, personal things, the best method of their choice is ‚Äúto touch in person‚Äù.  Often, an inexpensive manipulator is a better choice than a cool and sophisticated one. <br><br><h4>  System unit or monitor, or a little bit about the main components </h4><br><h5>  Window to the parallel world </h5><br>  As I said above, no matter where to begin to make a configuration - so why not start with a monitor?  I most often start it with him.  Because this is a window into the world, a device, the quality and size of which most often determine your pleasure from the game / movie / work efficiency (underline the necessary). <br>  There are many monitors, but I would like to highlight only a few models that deserve attention.  In my opinion, it is: <br><ol><li>  relatively accessible monitors on S-IPS matrices: <br><ul><li>  Dell 2209WA </li><li>  NEC EA231WMi </li><li>  Philips 240PW9ES </li><li>  HP LP2475w </li><li>  Dell U2410 </li></ul></li><li>  32 ‚ÄùFullHD TVs on S-IPS matrices: <br><ul><li>  LG 32LF2510 </li><li>  LG 32LH3000 </li></ul></li><li>  23-27 "monitors on TN-matrices (there are too many of them to enumerate, in my opinion, the main thing when choosing them is that there is a digital input and the necessary adjustments). </li><li>  Samsung F2380 on PVA for working with texts, it is not suitable for another, because it is brake. </li></ol><h5>  Rocket under the table </h5><br>  Let's go back to the system unit.  Minimally, it includes a processor + cooler + motherboard (a so-called <i>platform</i> ), RAM, HDD (SSD), a video card, an optical disk drive, a case with a power supply. <br><ul><li>  Recently, the choice of platform has become a simple task: if there is no $ 330 for a processor + mother, then AMD is taken, otherwise Intel.  Those.  The minimum Intel processor I can recommend is the Core i5-750. </li><li>  From the ‚ÄúAMD mill‚Äù, the most attractive is now the Athlon x3 435 - all four of these processors I bought turned out to be the unsecured Deneb core - this means that you could safely unblock another core and 6 MB of L3 cache.  It is desirable now to take the mother already on AM3 with DDR3 memory. </li><li>  Both DDR2 and DDR3 standard memory now costs about the same (~ $ 50 for a 2 GB module).  I always take a standard, non-Vierklokersky memory.  For overclocking is needed only during extreme overclocking, and since you are reading this topic, you are unlikely to need it;) </li><li>  Regarding the storage subsystem - if the computer is not budget, I recommend to take 2 disks (or SSD + HDD) - one for the system, the other for data storage.  I prefer WD, Hitachi, sometimes I take Samsung. </li><li>  Since the plates of hard drives at 7200 rpm have now reached 500 GB, it is advisable to take a 500 GB screw for the system.  For data - this is how much you personally need - you can take the Green version (5400 rpm) </li><li>  DVD-RW, I personally take the LG for the usual 25 bucks - they serve for a long time, and high-quality record. </li><li>  The video card is here or it is, or it is not :) For games, it is recommended to use at least Ati 4670 / GeForce 9600GT for a 19 ‚Äùmonitor, 4770 / GTS250 for 20-22, and GTX260 / 5770 for FullHD.  To work (with graphics) in the general case, the built-in one will be enough, but here you need to look at specific software - can it load the video card and with what API.  For multimonitor modes, simple video cards with two dvi are most often taken. </li><li>  The case and power supply unit is selected according to the number of peripheral devices / system voracity / length of video cards ... </li></ul><h4>  Selection examples </h4><br>  And now let's explain the general reasoning with examples. <br><br><h5>  Example 1. Computer for programming </h5><br>  So - TK: <br>  Need a computer for programming.  Eclipse development environment.  Java language.  It is quite possible to use servers like Apache Tomcat, etc.  The budget is $ 1000. <br>  The task is clear.  Where to distribute money?

      Option 1. We start with the monitors.  For a programmer, it will be convenient to take 2 displays, isn't it ?;) Suppose a programmer is spoiled for good display quality, so take two Dell 2209WA.  Total $ 700. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/bfe/ac8/4d4/bfeac84d4fd85a971433fd7f80687deb.jpg" alt="image"><br>  On the system unit remains $ 300.  Not much. <br>  We take your favorite spreadsheet and the price of the nearest <s>stall of a</s> sane store.  We pretend. <br><ol><li>  CPU choose 3-core, with the ability to unlock the cores - AMD Athlon II X3 425 BOX - <b>$ 80</b> </li><li>  Cooler - boxed - <b>$ 0</b> </li><li>  We will choose an inexpensive motherboard, on an AM3 socket, with the possibility of unlocking (SB710 and SB750 south bridges) with DDR3 support ‚Äî for the future, as well as with integrated video ‚Äî for real 2 monitors, it‚Äôs a pity that one will have to be connected via VGA.  Let it be, for example, MSI 760GM-E51 - <b>$ 70</b> </li><li>  In memory, let's take one bar 2 Gb DDR3 Hynix 1333 MHz - <b>$ 50</b> </li><li>  One hard drive, on one plate and at 7200 rpm - Samsung HD502HJ - <b>$ 55</b> </li><li>  LG DVD-RW - <b>$ 25</b> </li><li>  The case and power supply unit - since we have a built-in video, it is quite possible to do 400 watts.  ASUS TA8xx 400W series - <b>$ 45</b> </li></ol>  Total - 325 bucks. <br>  The selection stage is over, now is the evaluation stage. <br><br>  As always got out of the budget :) Yes, and 2 GB is not enough for today.  You always have to make compromises;) Well, it's not scary, you can search where it is cheaper, you can cut down the percentage ... For example, put the dual-core Athlon 240. Although 4 potential cores and another L3 cache is IMHO overpayments. <br><br>  Option 2. Let's start with the system unit ... So, I want a normal system unit that will not slow down.  We take 2 screws, a good processor, enough RAM ... Let's see what happens. <br><br><ol><li>  CPU - Intel Core i5-750 BX80605I5750 - <b>$ 220</b> </li><li>  cooler - box - <b>$ 0</b> </li><li>  MB - Gigabyte GA-P55-UD3 - <b>$ 130</b> </li><li>  RAM - 4 Gb DDR3 Hynix 1333 - <b>$ 100</b> </li><li>  HDD - Samsung HD502HJ <b>$ 55</b> </li><li>  HDD2 - WD WD10EADS <b>$ 95</b> </li><li>  Video Card - ATI HD4350 <b>$ 40</b> </li><li>  DVD-RW LG - <b>$ 25</b> </li><li>  Case ASUS TA8xx 400W series <b>$ 45</b> </li></ol><br>  We received 710 dollars - in principle, one more Dell 2209WA is enough, or, if you're a fan of a larger diagonal at the expense of quality, you can even take 27 ‚Äùon the TN - LG W2753V. <br><br>  The evaluation phase is over.  Now the stage of revaluation and recursion. <br>  After compiling several such configurations, we take the one that is closer to our liking :) - and we are already starting to work with it - we will cut something down, add something, replace something.  I think that any literate person, by searching on <a href="http://google.com/">google.com</a> by the name of the device, can find information on specific pieces of hardware, their tests and reviews on them.  So the choice in the revaluation leave to readers. <br><br><h5>  Example 2. Computer for the animator </h5><br>  Suppose you need a computer for an artist-animator, he likes to use Maya, for a couple of 3D Studio MAX, there is $ 2800, which you want to spend with maximum sense.  A lot of money, so an unsuccessful example :) <br>  There is already a good quality display needed. <br>  I think a 30 ‚Äùdisplay on S-IPS of any brand is suitable - this is minus $ 1500. <br>  Of course, you can use two 24-inch - $ 1200-1500.  Who is more convenient. <br>  For the remaining $ 1200, the Core i7 is taken with a good cooler - the processor will often be 100% loaded ... <br><ul><li>  CPU - Intel Core i7-920 BX80601920 - <b>$ 320</b> </li><li>  cooler - Noctua NH-U12P - <b>$ 55</b> </li><li>  MB - MSI X58 Platinum - <b>$ 250</b> </li><li>  RAM - 12Gb DDR3 Hynix 1333 - <b>$ 300</b> </li><li>  HDD - 3xSamsung HD502HJ - <b>$ 165</b> </li><li>  Video Card - Palit GeForce 9600GT 512 MB - <b>$ 90</b> </li><li>  DVD - LG DVD-RW - <b>$ 25</b> </li><li>  Case - Cooler Master Elite 33x 460W series - <b>$ 75</b> </li></ul> Total 1280 dollars <br>  Further - assessment and refinement by the client. <br><br>  I won‚Äôt write configurations for games - I have already divorced them a lot :) I‚Äôll say that they mostly need a powerful video card, 4GB of memory, and, recently, 3-4 core processors. <br><br>  When choosing, you can use the price lists of your favorite offices, or the largest sites - you can immediately collect the config in them virtually, based on the compatibility of the components. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/82169/">https://habr.com/ru/post/82169/</a></p>
