A rude boss, a bad team, an irregular working day - all these are disadvantages, and the majority just tolerate them, not trying to change anything.  But there are exceptions, and quite unusual ones.

      For example, a 44-year-old Frenchman named Fr√©d√©ric Desnard sued his former employer.  Disnard, who previously worked at the perfume company, demands compensation in the amount of 360 thousand euros for low workload and boring work, writes <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2016/05/02/frenchman-demands-280000-after-being-bored-out-of-his-job/">The Telegraph</a> .  Moreover, there was so little work that Desnard simply ‚Äúwas mortally bored‚Äù in the workplace.  According to the plaintiff, his employer did not let him show himself, loading with routine, petty and boring tasks.  As a result, the Frenchman was unable to move up the career ladder or grow like a professional. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  He also claims that he got health problems, including depression, sleep disorders, epilepsy and stomach ulcers, because of the boring work. <br><br>  The plaintiff‚Äôs lawyer argues that it was beneficial for the employer to ‚Äúkill the client with boredom to death‚Äù rather than pay his severance pay.  The company's lawyer claims that Desnard has no evidence, and his accusations are unfounded.  ‚ÄúFor four years, he never said that he was bored.  And if he really didn‚Äôt have anything to do during all these years, why didn‚Äôt he talk about it? ‚ÄùThe lawyer commented on the situation. <br><br>  The plaintiff insists that his superiors at Interparfum did not give him any real management tasks, allowing him to carry out small and routine tasks from time to time. <br><br>  In France, litigation involving workers who ‚Äúburned‚Äù in their workplace due to excessive workload is not uncommon.  But the process where the employer is accused of a small amount of work is unique. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/368901/">https://habr.com/ru/post/368901/</a></p>
