      A couple of weeks ago, YouTube tested this theory by releasing the annual YouTube retrospective Rewind.  The eight-minute video was crammed with YouTube-related meta-humor, YouTube stars (Ninja! The Try Guys! Bongo Cat!) And familiar stars (Will Smith! Trevor Noah! John Oliver!).  The video was cleverly produced and looked solid, mentioned the popular game Fortnite, popular video formats and sang praise to the variety and inclusiveness of YouTube. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  This was supposed to be a celebration of the whole year of YouTube's creative success, but the video caused a real storm and led to <a href="https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/krishrach/people-are-campaigning-to-get-this-years-youtube-rewind-as">the</a> minus <a href="https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/krishrach/people-are-campaigning-to-get-this-years-youtube-rewind-as">campaign</a> , which itself became a meme.  48 hours before the video put dizlik more than 4 million people.  Last week, the video received the most dizlike in the entire history of the site, collecting more than 10 million, and beating the previous record holder, the video for Justin Bieber‚Äôs song, Baby. <br><br>  It turns out that so many YouTube fans were angry about something that was not in this video.  Many of the most memorable moments of the outgoing year - the August boxing match between KSI and Logan Paul, two UT stars, whose fight became a <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-45310986">popular show</a> , followed by millions - was left behind the scenes.  Some of the most famous YouTube were missing, including Felix Kjelberg, known as PewDiePie, one of the most popular creators in UT history, who most recently appeared in the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3D_GuOjXYl5ew%26t%3D103s">annual review of</a> Rewind in 2016. <br><br>  Some YouTube videos <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3DNL9Wbd0Bzl4">liked it</a> .  But many people perceived it as evidence that the UT company insults the UT community, slipping into the company of local creative leaders a handful of generally accepted stars, and smoothing out the main points in order to get a suitable advertising scene. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/YbJOTdZBX1g" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs completely divorced from the community and its authors,‚Äù said Kjelberg, who called this year‚Äôs Rewind compilation ‚Äúa catastrophe filmed‚Äù in his own <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3DwYT1Qq6mo4I">video review</a> . <br><br>  Ethan Klein, another popular yutuber, published his review entitled ‚ÄúIt's time to stop YouTube Rewind‚Äù. <br><br>  Marquez Brownlee, the author of UT, who was included in Rewind, made his own video clip called ‚ÄúThe Problem with YouTube Rewind‚Äù based on his motives, where he more calmly explained that the main problem of the video was that he tried to please two incomparable audiences who wanted to get the full breadth of response from UT, and advertisers who need to be convinced that you can safely spend money on this platform. <br><br>  UT spokesperson, Andrea Favil, said that ‚Äúthey didn‚Äôt have such a goal as dropping the Baby clip from the throne‚Äù.  She added: ‚ÄúWe may not like honest reviews, but we listen to them and are grateful for how much people care.  Trying to express all the magic of UT in one video is like trying to drive a lightning into a bottle.  We also learned that creating good content is hard - with this we emphasize our respect and admiration for the authors of UT who do this every day. ‚Äù <br><br>  Favil's statement ended with an animated excerpt from the cartoon about Bob's sponge: <br><br><div class="oembed"><div><div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"><video controls="" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;">  Your browser does not support HTML5 video. <source src="https://int.nyt.com/data/videotape/finished/2018/12/1544727955/14spongebob-476w.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video></div></div></div><br><br>  The decision of UT to fit within the framework of <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%25A1%25D0%25B8%25D1%2581%25D1%2582%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BC%25D0%25B0_%25D1%2580%25D0%25B5%25D0%25B9%25D1%2582%25D0%25B8%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B3%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B2_%25D0%2590%25D0%25BC%25D0%25B5%25D1%2580%25D0%25B8%25D0%25BA%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BD%25D1%2581%25D0%25BA%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B9_%25D0%25BA%25D0%25B8%25D0%25BD%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B0%25D1%2581%25D1%2581%25D0%25BE%25D1%2586%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B0%25D1%2586%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B8">the G rating</a> can be understood.  Advertisers are suspicious of the platform since last year‚Äôs disclosure of the fact that UT algorithms put some commercials in videos containing extremist materials, racist content and hate speech texts.  This has led some advertisers to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/23/business/media/youtube-advertisers-offensive-content.html%3Fmodule%3Dinline">stop advertising</a> for UT.  After that, the service tightened the monetization rules, limited the set of videos that can make money through advertising, which caused a new conflict with the authors, who called it ‚Äúadpokalipsis‚Äù [from (ad) vertisement - advertising]. <br><br>  It is also natural that UT avoids advertising authors with controversial creativity.  Paul, with 18 million subscribers and one of the most famous YouTube, spent most of the year smoothing his blame for the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/02/business/media/logan-paul-youtube.html%3Fmodule%3Dinline">unfortunate episode</a> in which he removed a corpse hanging from a tree in the Japanese "suicide forest".  With over 76 million subscribers, Kjelberg has been constantly criticized for his behavior in front of the camera, including <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-intersect/wp/2017/02/16/an-attack-by-the-media-pewdiepie-apologizes-for-nazi-jokes-but-says-the-press-is-out-to-get-him/%3Futm_term%3D.0977ef2caffc">Nazi jokes</a> and the exaltation of the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/12/10/18134748/pewdiepie-er-pewnews-youtube-hateful-content-anti-semitic">anti-Semitic</a> UT <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/12/10/18134748/pewdiepie-er-pewnews-youtube-hateful-content-anti-semitic">channels</a> . <br><br>  Swearing between the service and its authors is not a new phenomenon.  However, disputes over Rewind are a signal of larger problems of UT, trying to expose themselves as a stronghold of cold-blooded and inclusive creativity, while he is accused of <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/10/opinion/sunday/youtube-politics-radical.html%3Fmodule%3Dinline">radicalizing a</a> generation of young people whom he allegedly pushes to more and more extreme content, allowing reactionary fanatics and lovers of <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/08/business/youtube-rapid-response-partisans.html%3Fmodule%3Dinline">conspiracy theories</a> dominate the platform. <br><br>  Attempts of UT are complicated by the fact that the service actually has a lot of diverse and interesting authors making exciting videos.  However, these voices can hardly be heard behind the roar of the most odious figures.  On YouTube, Rewind did not mention Alex Jones, the founder of the Infowars website, devoted to conspiracy theories [and not only] that created an UT empire with millions of subscribers, whose videos scored more than 1.6 billion views.  No one mentioned the political YouTube group that makes up the ‚Äú <a href="https://datasociety.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/DS_Alternative_Influence.pdf">alternative influence network,</a> ‚Äù as Rebecca Lewis from the Data and Social Studies Institute calls it ‚Äî a cohort of video authors who use them to promote radical right ideas. <br><br>  Last year, UT made excellent attempts to clean up the platform.  This summer, the service <a href="https://variety.com/2018/digital/news/youtube-alex-jones-ban-1202896074/">banned Alex Jones</a> for inciting hatred, [ <a href="https://aurora.network/articles/136-chelovek-i-obshhestvo/60702-tekhgiganty-stirajut-politologa-aleksa-dzhonsa-iz-sotssetey">not so simple</a> / approx.  transl.] and tried to make so that video related to conspiracy theories, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/03/technology/youtube-right-wing-channels.html%3Fmodule%3Dinline">did not fall into sections of popular</a> . <br><br>  However, people like Kjelberg and Paul - the stars that have gained popularity thanks to UT, and still collecting tens of millions of views a month - maintain dysfunctional relationships with the platform.  UT does not want to encourage their behavior by promoting their videos officially, but at the same time does not want to quarrel with their large and passionate audiences.  And since other platforms cannot boast of such large audiences and earning potential, they are stuck in unpleasant purgatory, and make offended videos about how unfairly UT dealt with them, while trying not to cross the line beyond which they can be banned or not give them money to make videos. <br><br>  This tense relationship - between the image of the service, which is building up a supportive and tolerant space and the people behind the most popular content of the platform - is at the center of disputes about YouTube Rewind.  If UT tried to create the right picture representing the most popular faces of the service, he would have to include fanatics, reactionaries and young fans of humor on the edge of the video.  A review of past events at UT, which included only a demonstration of tolerance and pluralism, resembles a sample of frames from a meteorological show, where only clear days are shown.  It is possible to look at it more pleasantly, but it does not convey the real state of the weather. <br><br>  There is nothing wrong with UT showing in the summing-up of the year a video of the good work done on the platform.  It is a pity that for this the platform has to cut out a large part of its history from the script.  Perhaps, instead of trying to please everyone next year, the service will have to become more similar to how he presented himself in the review video of this year - as a platform, which he obviously wants to be. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/433688/">https://habr.com/ru/post/433688/</a></p>
