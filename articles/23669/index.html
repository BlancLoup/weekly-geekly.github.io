  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Motivation, life and work, again about her</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Learning to force myself to do something for me was unrealistically difficult.  I was very lucky with the abilities, so everything that I undertook to do was very simple.  This has been terribly cheering on me for the past five years.  When I know that for me the business costs 30 minutes, I will reach the last 30 minutes and will do everything ‚Äúalmost on time‚Äù.  ‚ÄúAlmost‚Äù, because the further I tested my abilities, the more often they gave misfires.  I simply did not have time, I was late with the surrender, for meetings and of course I was worried about this.  Incomplete, deferred cases were accumulating and accumulating, I was overgrown with increasing obligations, ideas, projects.  All this was so depressing that the brain worked out a defensive reaction - to throw everything out of my head, and then push in another day, two, an hour, ahhrrr! <br><br>  <strong>It was all over the fact that I missed a bunch of good projects, spoiled relations with some people and left the institute, like that.</strong> <br><br>  About three months ago I began to look for a solution, and it seems that it was already in my head.  I am pleased to tell you about it.

    <a name="habracut"></a><br>  <strong>1. I want and need</strong> <br>  In my head there are always heaps of ideas, customers constantly call, beautiful girls run over in front of their noses, life boils around and the word ‚ÄúI want‚Äù pops up. <br>  I want to make this project and make money.  I want to write a search engine steeper than Google.  I want in the end that dark little one. <br>  This is a drive!  Emotions overwhelm us, we see the goal, we see the picture of how we achieve it and we want it. <br><br>  Here we make the decision to do, go to our goal, throw plans and for some reason quickly replace the ‚ÄúI want‚Äù with ‚Äúwe need‚Äù.  This is a routine.  When you set yourself the condition ‚ÄúI need to do what I have planned,‚Äù you simply struggle with the need, stubbornly resist the cause.  "It is necessary" knits hand and foot. <br><br>  <strong>This is similar to auto-training, but with the wording: ‚ÄúI want to work,‚Äù it is much more pleasant to turn up the mountains than: ‚ÄúI need to work.‚Äù</strong> <br><br>  <strong>2. The cost of owning</strong> <br>  You want to do the right things.  Think, really this is what you want. <br>  Not so long ago, I wanted to become a professional snowboarder, and now I understand that this is just nonsense.  I want to ride and have fun, but dragging my life up to 40 years from a sponsor to a sponsor until you are thrown out of old age is not. <br><br>  If you agree to any stupid want, then very soon you can acquire a bunch of things that you really do not need and miss the most important thing. <br><br>  <strong>Any goal must be carefully analyzed.</strong> <br><br>  <strong>3. Honesty</strong> <br>  The brain is an amazing thing, it always takes care of our mental balance.  This often leads to self-deception.  If something goes wrong, we are often afraid to worry about it and just put it away, doing anything, but not this. <br><br>  It is important to constantly note, especially for yourself, if something is wrong.  Cut down any project at a stage when it is clear that it will not give anything.  Clearly record any change in timing.  It is not necessary to imagine that the coder will be able to ‚Äústrain up‚Äù and do weekly work in two days.  Do not think that the designer will suddenly surrender work ahead of time.  It‚Äôs gone, we don‚Äôt fit - we chop off our shoulders without guilt and regret - we decide how it will be now. <br><br>  Honesty with yourself will lead to honesty with the rest. <br>  Today I got into a completely idiotic story when I arrived at the meeting and waited for the person for 50 minutes.  It turned out when I called him to confirm the time and place of the meeting, he was at home in his bed and just struggled with sleep.  I asked where he was, he lied that he was not at home to justify himself, as a result, he completely overslept.  Nightmare, yes? <br>  And, putting a hand on the heart, didn‚Äôt any of us ever do the same: didn‚Äôt we call, say, a deliberately unrealistic term, didn‚Äôt indicate the cosmic cause of the breakdown?  By deceiving ourselves, we easily deceive others.  If it is clear that something is not working, it breaks down - those who depend on this period should immediately find out about it. <br><br>  <strong>Be honest with yourself and others in everything.</strong> <br><br>  <strong>4. Trifle</strong> <br>  Yeah, calling, say, a customer and telling about new terms is an unpleasant business, but if you don‚Äôt do it now, it will grow into a whole problem. <br>  Life is full of small unpleasant affairs, I got masochism to resolve them.  It's nice that you already did it when you did. <br><br>  <strong>We are happy with the resolution of any small, unpleasant business.</strong> <br><br>  <strong>5. Planning</strong> <br>  I do not write for myself daily routines by the hour, except in rare cases when it is important to get to many different places in one day.  But I keep a todo list with deadlines.  Cases are divided in great detail into small ones, it is easier to swallow them. <br><br>  I have it is not an auxiliary, but the main tool of work.  I just see what I need to do and the sequence of events is immediately in my head. <br>  Here is a beauty: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/olpictures/417/f8c/306/417f8c30652884b5e215e385ceaec755.jpg" width="450" height="296" hspace="10" vspace="10"><br>  <em>An old office joke: ‚ÄúThere is one problem with these leaflets of urgent matters - in a year the glue shatters and they fall off.‚Äù</em> <br><br>  It's nice not to throw away the leaves with the done things, but to collect them as especially valuable stamps. <br><br>  In general, the technology of execution is completely unimportant, be it a notebook, board, PDA or laptop - as convenient. <br><br>  <strong>The main thing - all things are always in sight.</strong> <br><br>  <strong>6. Pirates!</strong>  <strong>Live the life</strong> <br>  The world around us is beautiful, why do many people fly headlong without noticing it?  Every minute of life is so awesome that you should not miss the chance to enjoy it. <br><br>  <strong>Whatever you do - if you don‚Äôt catch the buzz from it, then you‚Äôre doing something wrong.</strong> <br><br>  This is funny: <a href="http://www.procrastinators-anonymous.org/">Anonymous Volunteers Society</a> <br></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/23669/">https://habr.com/ru/post/23669/</a></p>
