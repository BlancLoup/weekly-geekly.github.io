To offer IT specialists free beer with pizza at some cafe / restaurant is a stereotype that got everyone - we know it for ourselves! <br><br>  Yes, we are tired of the image of an IT person as a shaggy and unshaven student with a bottle of beer in his hand! <br><br>  <b>Our action</b> is a joint promotion of two different services, but in both cases, personifying modern choices and modern technologies, whether at work or at home. <br>  In Moscow, we selected the most popular and specialized medical center that provides laser hair removal services, contacted a representative and organized integration with their CRM to enable automatic generation of individual promotional codes after the creation of a new server in the VPS.house personal account within this promotion. <br>  According to the results of visits to the procedure of hair removal, we pay the full cost for all the clients that came, and this is not less than 1000 rubles.  if the patient is a girl and 1500 rub.  if a man (see full price on the site <u><a href="https://epilas.ru/">epilas.ru</a></u> ). <br><br>  You are not ready for professional medical epilation yourself - offer a free procedure to your wife, girlfriend or friend - we assure you that she will not refuse. <br><br><h2>  What is laser hair removal? </h2><br>  Laser hair removal is the most modern way to get rid of hair radically in places where you would not want them to grow more.  The procedure is carried out by exposing the hair to light with a specially selected wavelength (810 and 940 nm), this wavelength affects the melanin contained in the hair, heating it, heat reaches the hair root, from which the microvessel feeding the hair follicle is sealed.  Having no power, hair falls out of it for 10-14 days and no longer grows until 8 years old. <br><br>  The main nuance of laser hair removal, which still stops many, is that the procedure needs to be done in a course, an average of 6-10 sessions with an interval of 3-5 weeks.  This is not due to the desire to dissolve you for money, but with the biology of our bodies.  The laser acts on the follicles through the hair, and at one time in the active growth phase is about 10-20% of the hair follicles, these are exactly the hair that we can see.  The rest are in a dormant state and the hair does not grow from them.  These phases alternate on average after 3-5 weeks, so the interval between treatments is recommended to choose one. <br>  With each new procedure, the hair will appear less and less.  So, by the way, including it is possible and to regulate the abundance of hair in those or other places, and not only radically remove all growing. <br>  <i>* Information from the official site of the medical center EPILAS, confirmed by our own practice!</i> <br><br>  There is no need to fight for the remaining scraps of body hair, accept that evolution will still take its own: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/-b/uc/bj/-bucbjymivro70qwgy7puse9cmk.png"><br><br><h2>  How to use the action? </h2><br>  On the main page of the <b><u><a href="https://vps.house/">VPS.house</a></u></b> website <b><u><a href="https://vps.house/">,</a></u></b> select the server configuration you need, then click on the ‚ÄúCreate server‚Äù button and you will see a window with confirmation of the selected tariff and specification of the calculation period: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/3z/ec/bl/3zecbla-i1lyvjvlnypnrvkfr2o.png"><br><br>  Under the cost of the server there is a link "I have a promotional code" - click on it and enter the promotional code: <br><table><tbody><tr><td align="center">  <b>EPIL-FOR-VPS</b> </td></tr></tbody></table>  Immediately after that, <b><u>the server cost will decrease by 10%</u></b> <br>  The next step is to proceed to the payment and choose any method convenient for you, including from the company's settlement account - all closing documents will be provided by the accounting department. <br><br>  You need to pay for the server immediately, only then the generation of a promotional code for a free laser hair removal procedure will work.

Thanks to a small range of services and involvement in conducting procedures exclusively for people with higher medical education (primarily dermatologists), they achieve maximum efficiency and safety procedures for the end client, while at one of the lowest prices in Moscow. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/uw/4f/u3/uw4fu32h_mgkirmjulac1zp4qzg.jpeg"><br><br>  A medical center was opened last summer and is now actively developing, publishing a lot of information in the media and popular blogs, actively promoting a new level of service and effectiveness of the procedures.  In March of this year, they already reported on a <a href="https://ria.ru/economy/20180321/1516957397.html"><u>ten-thousandth laser hair removal procedure</u></a> . <br><br>  Medical center EPILAS is a 5-minute walk from the Trubnaya metro station and is open daily from 09:00 to 22:00. <br><br><hr><br>  We hope that you perceive our small impromptu partner with enthusiasm! </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/358670/">https://habr.com/ru/post/358670/</a></p>
