Without using geek tools.  Like Skype. <br><br><h5>  Foreword </h5><br>  Few people know that mobile operators receive a huge percentage of income from those who once bought a SIM card-inserted and calling.  This is because buying a tariff with an enticing inscription or on the advice of a consultant, most often we do not think about the passage of time, operators have more and more new offers.  And at the old rates the price rises. <br>  Operators <b>specifically</b> raise prices at old rates.  Motivating it so that users switch to new tariffs and do not linger on old ones.  But in reality, few people follow the changes in tariffs.  There is an opinion rooted in society that once written in a piece of paper 2 rubles a minute, it means it will always be like that.  In fact, everything is different.  Operators simply profit from subscribers.  And it is difficult to find fault with them, because everything is for us, for our good. <br>  Unfortunately, really profitable old tariffs remained only for corporate users - connection to such tariffs is possible only on the gray market.  For us, ordinary citizens are constantly raising prices.

      In this topic, the main emphasis is placed on the fact that for some reason your operator suits you.  And you just want to save as part of your operator.  Despite the fact that competitors are cheaper. <br>  However, those who wish can also take advantage of the recommendations from this topic and choose for themselves something from the tariffs of another operator. <br>  In this topic, the focus will be only on logistics. <br>  No secrets.  :) <br><br>  The main thing to start! <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br><h5>  A small example: </h5><br><br>  In 2007, the Beeline introduced the <b>First Children's</b> Tariff to the market. An attractive price for SMS messages was <i>1 ruble 45 kopecks.</i>  Times went by, at first there was an increase in prices during the crisis time to <i>2 rubles 20 kopecks.</i>  Today, the cost of SMS at this rate is <i>3 rubles 95 kopecks.</i>  Whereas the continuation of the tariff is <b>First Children *</b> 2 rubles, 20 kopecks, while the popular <b>communication monster +</b> price of sms is 1.5 rubles. <br><br>  Think about it!  You bought a box inserted and think that everything is ok.  And during this time you began to overpay almost 2.5 times more expensive. <br><br>  <i>oh how much they love *</i> <i><br><br></i>  <i>All prices are for Moscow and MO</i> <br><br>  If you think that this story is only in Beeline, you are greatly mistaken.  All the operators of the so-called " <b>Big Three</b> " suffer from <b>gluttony</b> . But the topic is not what the bastards and bastards are. <br>  <i>Hedgehogs cried pricked but continued to eat a cactus.</i>  And how to make <s>these cacti smaller.</s>  It is cheaper to use communication. <br><br><h5>  Glue, scissors, paper </h5><br><br>  So, to save us, we need: <br><br>  Mobile phone. <br>  Half an hour of free time. <br>  ¬± 200 rubles in the account. <br><br>  If the first two points are clear.  So with the third, a lot of questions usually arise. <br>  I explain, 200 rubles is based on the cost of detailing the account and the transition to a favorable tariff.  Detailing Beeline for 30 days costs 30 rubles.  MTS, Megafon and TELE2 are free. <br>  For the transition to a more profitable tariff will also fork out.  From 90 to 150 rubles, depending on the operator. <br>  You feel, the desire to save immediately disappears somehow.  With the thought of having to pay 200 rubles.  This is the whole calculation of the operators.  Suppose I will overpay, but immediately I don‚Äôt want to give 200 rubles.  But in reality, the savings from today's investments will be greater than from overpayment on the old rates. <br>  For complacency, we can only note that 100 rubles is a new number with a favorable tariff.  You keep your number for another hundred rubles - a reasonably inexpensive charge for saving money. <br>  In general, we can assume that the net consumption of 100 rubles.  because the first hundred rubles are inevitable on the way to savings. <br><br>  <i>Prices are approximate, for Moscow and Moscow Region, for pricing in other regions I recommend to contact technical support of your telecom operator</i> <br><br><h5>  Process </h5><br><br>  First we need to get the bill details in order to understand what we pay for and how much.  And is it possible to save on this? <br><br>  <b>Bill</b> details - a detailed description of charges from your account, indicating the time and type of operation: call, sms, mms, Internet traffic. <br><br>  <b>Mytarif.ru</b> service <b>has</b> published on its website a wonderful instruction on how to get the details from its operator.  But in order not to create an extra habraeffect, I transferred this instruction to google docs. <br><br>  <i>To receive a password from your personal account, you must contact your operator‚Äôs technical support</i> <br><br>  <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Ai_7He3JMMrg4zcssjeSWgULgKxmMUD797KBbUY71gE/edit%3Fhl%3Dru%26authkey%3DCKXEo8gM">Mts</a> <br>  <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1iEpq34AD0XIGe5lAuuZtUtO1fuMZWZzxgN5kBgVDYWM/edit%3Fhl%3Dru%26authkey%3DCIbch6MP">Beeline</a> <br>  <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1-wSiQUBoVTahY1NbJUaddcAuv7LyYUK8sbCS7jtIprw/edit%3Fhl%3Dru%26authkey%3DCM-_xcEE">Megaphone</a> <br>  <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/18Q-5qLETYiybQuyA9oAInFt6_q4bAe7F-bmvv8_kKUQ/edit%3Fhl%3Dru%26authkey%3DCImElOEC">TELE2</a> <br><br>  So, we received a bill specification, while spending the conditional 30 ..... 150 rubles. <br><br>  Now, it needs to be analyzed with the help of specialized services.  On Habr√© was a review of two such analyzers.  This: <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/subconsciousness/16677/"><b>Tarifer.ru</b></a> and <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/personal/69201/"><b>MyTarif.ru</b></a> <br><br>  Subjectively, I like <a href="http://mytarif.ru/">mytarif.ru/ more</a> , the interface looks fresher and lighter.  However, <a href="http://tarifer.ru/">Tarifer.ru</a> gives more information, someone needs it not so much. <br><br>  Actually, we fill in the detailing for both services, and see what the system advises us.  However, if you recently connected any discounts significantly cheapening your tariff.  The system may be wrong. <br><br>  But this is a topic for those who have the old fare.  Here, just from the system will be useful. <br>  Also on these sites, you can find out what promotions, discounts you can connect.  However, the most information about promotions and discounts, posted on the website of your operator. <br>  Also, if you are ready to change your operator, the system can search for offers from competitors. <br><br>  Once you have decided on the tariff.  To which you want to go, you should go to the operator‚Äôs website and clarify the cost of switching to this tariff. <br><br>  Then go to him.  By typing a special team or in your account, where you ordered the account details. <br><br>  Everything.  It‚Äôs so easy to start saving on such a common thing as a mobile phone. <br><br>  <b>Brief conclusions:</b> <br>  (thanks <a href="http://geektimes.ru/users/shedal/" class="user_link">shedal</a> and <a href="http://geektimes.ru/users/volch/" class="user_link">volch</a> ) <br><br>  1. It is possible that the tariff that you took is not the same as it was when you took it. <br>  2. Perhaps your mobile tariff is not optimal for your needs; <br>  3. Compare fares and choose the most appropriate one; <br>  4. To simplify the comparison, ask for details from the opsox and upload to services like mytarif.ru. <br><br>  <b>Information from the developer</b> <a href="http://tarifer.ru/">Tarifer.ru</a> <a href="http://geektimes.ru/users/ulex/" class="user_link">Ulex</a> <br><br>  On behalf of the tarifer.ru developers, I would like to clarify something.  We are currently testing a new scheme of the service, so some users will not be able to directly download the details to the site.  Instead, there will be a field for entering the phone number and password to the personal account (and brief instructions for obtaining a password if it is not already there). <br><br>  Why is that?  I plan to write on Habr a separate article on this subject, but briefly I will tell here: <br>  First of all, most people have difficulties with obtaining details, including quite objective ones (for example, the Beeline server periodically lies and cannot fulfill requests). <br>  Secondly, and this is important - the call detailing does not give a complete picture.  In most cases, it does not contain information about the connected services, it most often does not contain information about periodic and one-time charges (subscription fees for the tariff and additional services, some content services). <br>  Thirdly, we have expanded the list of features of our service.  It is now not just the selection of the tariff. <br><br>  What the service does: <br>  After receiving the number and password, the robot enters the user's personal account, orders the call detail for the full calendar month, the bill for the same period, analyzes the list of connected services, receives data about the current tariff and the list of tariffs that are available for the transition.  After receiving and analyzing data, several levels of recommendations are formed: <br>  - A list of ‚Äúsuspicious‚Äù services and paid services that could be connected implicitly (operators and content providers have a lot of ways to do this) plus information on how to disable these services. <br>  - Recommendations to reduce costs without changing the tariff - which options, packages, favorite numbers to connect to the current tariff and what will be the benefit of it. <br>  - Recommendations on changing the tariff - which tariff to switch to and which services to connect, while maintaining the current number. <br>  - Recommendations for changing the tariff with changing numbers. <br><br>  In other words, we are developing a service that will allow you to do a full audit of mobile costs, which will check if everything is in order and what ways are there to optimize, as well as protect you from fraudsters and imposed services. <br><br>  Today it works in test mode for Moscow subscribers of MTS, Beeline, MegaFon.  For the rest of the regions, so far everything is unchanged - it is possible to upload a detail file directly to the site and select tariffs.  By the way, today we support 15 regions and about 70 detail formats. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/117650/">https://habr.com/ru/post/117650/</a></p>
