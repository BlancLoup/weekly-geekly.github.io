  <section class="page js-page"><h1>I needed a report ...</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  It often happens that the ultimate goal of the existence of an enterprise information system is the relevance of the reporting data used by company management or provided to government bodies. <br><br>  At the same time, approved reporting requirements are already in place, as are reports that today, of course, are not compiled on paper, but, say, in MS EXCEL, but often still contain unsupported summary figures sent "from departments".  Of course, the quality of this information is positively affected by the high likelihood of subsequent checks and the severity of liability that comes from, but this does not save from mistakes.  One can not talk about how this ‚Äúwork‚Äù of specialists distracts from their professional activities and their attitude to reporting. <br><br>  Of course, now many organizations have inventory accounting information systems, but the structure of a specific accounting is determined by the configuration of this information system and the underlying information model of the organization‚Äôs accounting objects. <br>  In this article I want to describe the approach to the design of the information model of the accounting (inventory) system based on the requirements for the necessary reporting of the enterprise ... <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Obviously, primary data from places is still needed for the current summary report, and in order to avoid emergency hands during the reporting period, field users must regularly enter the necessary information.  In order not to overload many users with unnecessary work when creating a system, it is necessary to clearly define what minimum necessary input data are needed for reporting.  The composition of these data and their organization together determine the information model of the system.

      In my opinion, one of the key criteria for the quality of the information model is the accuracy of the reflection of the simulated physical reality.  But the track is like a ‚Äúmodel‚Äù - it should reflect only the objects that are significant for the applied tasks, their properties, and their interrelationships. <br><br><h3>  Infrastructure model </h3><br>  For example - the infrastructure model of any enterprise in general contains: <br><br><ul><li>  organizational and territorial structure of the enterprise (as infrastructure binding objects) </li><li>  composition (nomenclature, classifier, models) of the infrastructure objects </li><li>  their hierarchical (parent-child) and other relationships </li><li>  their attributes that are relevant to the tasks we solve </li></ul><br>  An analyst who understands the business of an enterprise can quickly form the core of an infrastructure model ‚Äî select the composition of objects necessary for accounting and build one or several hierarchical trees from them.  Further, when it is necessary to determine the composition of the attributes taken into account, the proposed method for analyzing the required reporting using the so-called ‚ÄúChessboard‚Äù can be useful. <br><br><h3>  Chess boards </h3><br>  Perhaps now there is some kind of ready-made solution for solving such problems on the market, maybe even all of this can be done in Excel, I will be happy with advice, suggestions and alternative proposals.  I did not find anything ready and had to write my small piece in the corporate web application environment on the ORACLE DBMS platform (the point is not how it was done - the article describes the general principle). <br><br>  The image of the required report is downloaded as a scan (photo) and placed under the transparent ‚ÄúChess Board‚Äù from which only the markup is visible in the pictures.  This board is - in this case, just a transparent table placed on top of the report image loaded into the system.  The table has column markings in letters and rows in numbers, which allows you to visually determine to which cell the picture area belongs - a report scan containing an element of interest to us.  Naturally, the scaling of the image scan and the table in the browser should be synchronized so that nothing slips. <br><br>  In the user interface it looks like this (examples of reports for railway workers): <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/hn/63/la/hn63lafccejjibkhoixnt5-8drk.png"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/ap/k-/ae/apk-aeso_7ulq_nqbu46o0scbew.png"><br><br>  Everything is simple - there are 2 frames - in the right is the very picture on the ‚ÄúChessboard‚Äù, and on the left is a table for manually entering the rows containing the necessary ones (according to the analyst): <br><br><ul><li>  The object of the information model is the primary object of accounting for the properties of which include the characteristics depicted in the cell (column) of the scanned report </li><li>  Characteristic (Attribute, Parameter) of the specified information model object </li><li>  Position on the board, for example, in the first picture, line 1 corresponds to ‚ÄúB-34‚Äù </li></ul><br><h3>  Accounting model formation </h3><br>  Thus, the information model of the accounting system (inventory) is formed on the basis of the Objects and their parameters used in the specific required reports. <br><br>  Accounting and Objects and their Parameters were previously formalized in the form of separate reference classifiers - the result of this is formed: <br><br><ul><li>  general structure-tree of accounting objects </li><li>  Cards of accounting objects containing parameters.  included in them from a single reference classifier of parameters and ordered in groups or reordered in accordance with the specific needs of accounting for this object </li></ul><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/tf/07/7a/tf077a_x3xq_y4wz_xwlpr4ii_s.png"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/uo/0b/q7/uo0bq7i6k2lkbzjhnmws23nljbg.png"><br><br>  The second picture on the right shows the links to the reporting forms for the formation of which there is a parameter in the card. <br><br><h3>  Conclusion </h3><br>  In practice, the use of this approach allowed: <br><br><ul><li>  justify the presence of objects and parameters through the need to implement on the basis of these data the required final reporting </li><li>  indicate, on specific parameters, their need for the implementation of specific reports, put forward requirements for the procedure for filling in registration cards in the product system and mandatory parameters </li><li>  in an orderly manner (without confusion and errors) to supplement the composition of the Accounting Objects and the composition of the parameters included in their registration cards with the information necessary for specific reporting purposes </li></ul><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/zv/uk/2f/zvuk2fai3pde1hnsnsymzbrundu.png"><br><br>  Thank you for attention! </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/283542/">https://habr.com/ru/post/283542/</a></p>
