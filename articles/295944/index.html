Having enough time and a good budget, I decided to experiment with the promotion of the products of my client.  How it was and what came out of it, read under the cut. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  For a start, I want to clarify the situation with the online store, it sells its own goods (clothing), and third-party products. <br>  It so happened that the store sells very well to small wholesale customers, but large, as it is not very.  This may be good, production is 100% loaded, and profits are more from small wholesale than from large sales.  Also, the client does not have a fully sales department, that is, a girl who processes customer requests from the site, mail and from the phone does not count.  Plus, the girl who is responsible for invoicing and sending the goods also cannot be considered in my opinion as a salesman. <br>  I thought that it was time to form such a department, since I had little experience in this, I decided that I should try everything on myself and then train a new employee. <br><br><h3>  Start.  Cold calls. </h3><br>  I chose this first as a way to attract customers because it is easier for me to communicate with people on the phone than to send the same type of ‚Äúspam‚Äù offers to e-mails.  The first problem, where to take the base for calling, for this is very well suited base of organizations 2GIS.  I chose a neighboring regional center, put keywords into the search, got a list of potential customers, carefully selected customers (I looked at their sites, read reviews on the network).  Then I created a sign, prepared the text of the offer and a letter template for sending to the interested client with more detailed information about the product and working conditions. <br><br><h3>  First call </h3><br>  The first few clients helped to understand what needs to be added to the speech of the appeal, they began to ask those questions that I did not expect to hear, but I knew the answers to them well.  After that, I made corrections to the speech of the appeal and began to ring round.  After 12 calls, I had 9 sent offers by mail, and a completely new appeal for customers.  I concluded that you need to listen to the client, he will prompt the right words for you to sell better. <br>  By the end of the day, 24 calls were made and 17 letters were sent.  After that, I decided to wait for the back reaction to the letters and see the result.  The next day there were 2 return letters from new customers, and the first sales were for good sums.  The next two days gave another 5 return letters and the same 2 sales.  Summarizing one day of work with cold calls, I can say that this method works. <br>  Choose the best base for calling, constantly consider feedback from the customer, this will speed up sales. <br>  This was my first, but not the last step towards the creation of a sales department. <br>  <b>To be continued.</b> </div>
