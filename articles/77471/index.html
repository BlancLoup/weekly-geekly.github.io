Today I want to tell you about such an outstanding personality as <strong>Steve McConnell</strong> . <br><br>  Interestingly, back in 1998, readers of Software Development magazine recognized Steve as one of the three most influential people in the software development industry along with Bill Gates and Linus Torvalds. <br><br>  In short, <strong>Steven C. McConnell</strong> is a programmer and author of books on software development.

      He wrote the books Rapid Development (1996), Software Project Survival Guide (1998), Professional Software Development (2004).  Software Development magazine, by the way, twice honored his books with the Jolt Excellence Award as the best software development book of the year. <br><br>  By the way, you must have heard the phrase ‚ÄúWrite the code as if it would be accompanied by a violent psychopath who knows where you live.‚Äù  So, this phrase is attributed to <strong>Steve</strong> . <br><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h2>  Perfect code </h2><br>  The book of <strong>Steve McConnell</strong> , which you are highly desirable to read at least once in your life.  Extremely useful for real practice material that promotes extremely competent principles in software development. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="http://img51.imageshack.us/img51/3903/1001320063.jpg" alt=" &amp;quot; &amp;quot;" title="Book &amp; quot; Perfect Code &amp; quot;"></div><br><br>  Here is a description of this <a href="http://lib.rus.ec/a/36822">book</a> , taken from the online store <a href="http://www.ozon.ru/context/detail/id/4729959/">OZON</a> : <br><br><blockquote>  <em>For more than 10 years, the first edition of this book was considered one of the best practical programming guidelines.</em>  <em>Now this book is fully updated with current trends and technologies and supplemented with hundreds of new examples illustrating the art and science of programming.</em> <em><br><br></em>  <em>Based on academic research, on the one hand, and practical experience in commercial software development, on the other, the author synthesized a clear, pragmatic guide from the most effective methods and most effective principles.</em> <em><br><br></em>  <em>Whatever your professional level, whatever development tools you work with, whatever the complexity of your project, you will find the necessary information in this book, it will make you think and help you create a perfect code.</em> </blockquote><br><br><h2>  Professional software development </h2><br><br>  I will not recommend this book for mandatory reading.  For the most part, it is a memoir and a lot of thoughts of the author.  (they say it is similar to Straustrup <a href="http://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%2594%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B7%25D0%25B0%25D0%25B9%25D0%25BD_%25D0%25B8_%25D1%258D%25D0%25B2%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BB%25D1%258E%25D1%2586%25D0%25B8%25D1%258F_C%252B%252B">Design and Evolution C ++</a> ) <br><br>  An interesting and easy-to-read book, if you are passionately studying all the issues related to software development.  Otherwise, it is better to devote more time to more practical materials. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="http://img51.imageshack.us/img51/3152/1000420428.jpg" alt=" &amp;quot;  &amp;quot;" title="Book &amp; quot; Professional Software Development &amp; quot;"></div><br><br>  For convenience, I also provide a description of the book: <br><br><blockquote>  <em>Steve McConnell, author of the best-selling book "Perfect Code", other books and numerous articles on software development, convincingly shows that software development can be consistently successful if you make the software developer profession itself more perfect.</em> <em><br><br></em>  <em>It not only shows why and how the industry came to its modern state, and describes the steps that anyone who wants to take a new level in software development must take.</em> <em><br><br></em>  <em>He also speaks about corporate methodologies designed to increase the number of professionally executed projects, and the licensing of organizations and academic curricula as a means of enhancing professionalism and individual developers, and in the software industry as a whole.</em> </blockquote><br><br><h2>  10 deadly sins in assessing the complexity of software development </h2><br><br>  On HabraHabr relatively recently there was <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/pm/75903/">an excellent article</a> , which I just can not fail to mention.  Namely, a short and clear retelling (and translation) of the hour of the <a href="http://construx.com/Page.aspx%3Fhid%3D2929">webinar</a> from Steve McConnell, which was held in June 2009. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="http://img190.imageshack.us/img190/4673/conev.png" alt=" " title="Cone of uncertainty"></div><br><br>  I strongly recommend to read.  One of the commentators of this article noticed very correctly: <br><br><blockquote>  <em>Most (or even all) of the ‚Äúdeadly sins‚Äù cited in one way or another are understood by any adequate developer, but having such a list is very useful - you can once again review it before starting a new project and save yourself from unnecessary mistakes.</em>  <em>To favorites!</em> </blockquote><br><br>  <strong>PS</strong> It so happened (I already wrote about this on <a href="http://twitter.com/v673">Twitter</a> ) that in my life I ran into two McConells: Steve and <a href="http://financepro.ru/2008/01/08/k.-r.-makkonnell-s.-l.-brju-jekonomiks..html">Campbell</a> .  Do not confuse them.  These are two completely different professionals.  One is in economics, the other is in software development. <br><br>  Steve McConnell is an extremely interesting person.  Look, for example, what he did in his <a href="http://www.stevemcconnell.com/theater/theater.htm">home theater</a> .  A list of all <a href="http://www.stevemcconnell.com/books.htm">his books</a> can be found there.  In general, I recommend to explore his <a href="http://www.stevemcconnell.com/">personal site</a> . <br><br><h2>  Btw! </h2><br><br>  I already mentioned an amazing book. <a href="http://lib.ru/ANEKDOTY/FEINMAN/feinman.txt">You are joking of course, Mr. Feynman!</a>  in one of <a href="http://v673.com/personalities/paul-graham/">his</a> past <a href="http://v673.com/personalities/paul-graham/">articles</a> . <br><br>  So: it turns out that there is also a continuation of this wonderful book: <a href="http://lib.rus.ec/b/136069/read">What do you care about what others think!</a>  If you have free time and you like to read other people's stories (very close to us, programmers) - I definitely recommend it! <br><br>  <strong>PS</strong> Taking this opportunity: I post a huge amount of interesting links, articles, recommendations and information about various web projects on my <a href="http://twitter.com/v673">twitter</a> , which I try to keep interesting.  [the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãthis article, by the way, was born on twitter] And I write separate articles about IT-subject in my <a href="http://v673.com/">non-commercial blog</a> .  Join now! <br><br>  Respectfully, <br>  Adept of Logic. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/77471/">https://habr.com/ru/post/77471/</a></p>
