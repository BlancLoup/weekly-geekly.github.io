In other words, reduce the number of managers and paper work, replacing them with the functionality that Agora has.  With the help of the system, users can not only independently form orders, but also receive information about the remaining quantity of goods, book it and give a command to assemble and ship it.  <a href="http://wanted.vc/blog/new-consumer-rights/">+++</a> <br><habracut>

In addition to them, we were able to remember offhand even BigBuzzy, Groupon, Kupikupon, Biglion, Glavskidka, Vygod.ru, Boncoupon and Sellberry.  The basis of these services is the same principle: the company provides a discount, and the website notifying of the discount provides a stream of customers, taking either a coupon fee (from buyers) or a percentage of sales (from sellers).  In this case, discounts are most often in a strictly limited period of time.  <a href="http://www.smskupon.ru/">SMSKupon</a> works differently.  <a href="http://wanted.vc/blog/%25D1%2581%25D0%25BA%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B4%25D0%25BA%25D0%25B8-%25D0%25B4%25D0%25BB%25D1%258F-%25D0%25BC%25D0%25B5%25D1%2581%25D1%2582%25D0%25BD%25D1%258B%25D1%2585/">+++</a> <br><br><a name="habracut"></a><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/e37/2ff/f1b/e372fff1bd0b5e66328fdb676e4f26c6.png" align="left">  You just parted with the girl with whom you planned to build a joint future, and decided on this occasion how to drink.  After the third, it turned out that your cash ran out (and you cannot use <a href="http://wanted.vc/blog/black-square/">CodePays</a> , because all the money from your bank account went to pay for car insurance, which <a href="http://wanted.vc/blog/online-garage/">CarCorner</a> reminded you <a href="http://wanted.vc/blog/online-garage/">about</a> ). you are sitting now and for what reason.  Therefore, in a couple of minutes you will receive a brotherly gift from him - a couple of virtual glasses of the very drink that you so successfully began to be treated with.  You present them to the waiter, who turns the virtual glasses into quite real ones, and, having mentally thanked the comrade, continue the feast of the spirit.  <a href="http://wanted.vc/blog/coffee-download-free-sms/">+++</a> <br><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/0c9/34f/166/0c934f1662d3278bc4357c75dd888db6.jpg" align="left"><br>  The creators of the <a href="http://knopka24.ru/">‚ÄúButtons of Life‚Äù</a> have statistics regarding your parents and grandparents. <br>  According to these statistics, 33% of people over 60 fall at least once a year.  Half of the falls cause damage, 25% of people with a fracture of the femur die within the first six months, and only a quarter of those who have fallen back to their previous mobility. <br>  After a fall, more than half of the elderly cannot rise, 80% of them are not able to dial a mobile number. <br>  Meanwhile, providing care for 2-4 hours after a fall reduces the risk of death by 80%.  <a href="http://wanted.vc/blog/%25D0%25B6%25D0%25B0%25D1%2582%25D1%258C-%25D1%2587%25D1%2582%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B1%25D1%258B-%25D0%25B6%25D0%25B8%25D1%2582%25D1%258C/">+++</a> <br><br><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/217/bb6/f9e/217bb6f9ebcd61f49239fe76ab7369ce.png" align="left">  Car dealers are interested in selling as many cars as possible.  It is a fact.  You are interested in buying the car you like as cheap as possible.  This is also a fact.  <a href="http://xn--80aafa3dxak.xn--p1ai/">AvtoVau!</a>  I tried to process these facts so that everyone was as pleasant as possible.  The result is a service where buyers come to find the best deal, and dealers - as soon as possible to sell the car.  <a href="http://wanted.vc/blog/wow-factor/">+++</a> <a href="http://wanted.vc/blog/wow-factor/"><br><br></a> <img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/08b/29e/95e/08b29e95eb14224af8512b260ef55a64.png" align="left">  ‚ÄúBorrowing a couple of thousand before the salary‚Äù in a bank is not the best idea, even if you need these couple of thousand now more than anything else.  In such situations, we usually look for altruists in our surroundings and lend to them.  But it happens that they have nothing to lend. <br>  And then the place of several altruistic heroes is occupied by hundreds of others using the <a href="http://billiloan.com/">http://billiloan.com/</a> service.  <a href="http://wanted.vc/blog/non-bank-business/">+++</a> <br><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/fe8/f72/9d6/fe8f729d6f632d323e1f718b8c90c58d.jpg" align="left">  10-15 years ago, a mobile phone seemed like a miracle of technology, capable of solving all communication problems.  However, in addition to calls and sms from a mobile phone, we are no less actively using e-mail, fax, and some people also have conference calls.  <a href="https://www.comtube.com/">Comtube</a> tried to integrate all of the above on one site, adding a host of useful features.  <a href="http://wanted.vc/blog/good-links/">+++</a> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/982/595/555/98259555585eb67bf7d3ee7a77e16c3d.png" align="left">  Along with suggestions for the deformation of various parts of the body in the spam folder most often appear letters with the subject "Creating sites."  By and large, a letter from <a href="http://www.cyberface.pro/">CyberFace</a> , do service mailing, would also look the same.  But there is a significant difference between the sites created using the <a href="http://www.cyberface.pro/">CyberFace</a> service and what the authors of spam mailings usually do.  <a href="http://wanted.vc/blog/%25D1%2581%25D0%25B0%25D0%25B9%25D1%2582-%25D0%25BF%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B4-%25D0%25BA%25D0%25BB%25D1%258E%25D1%2587/">+++</a> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/ca1/e40/fed/ca1e40fed35bb4421287ece29d990f79.png" align="left">  You have thought out in detail how your cafe will look, what color the tablecloths on the tables will look like, what the waitresses will be dressed up in, what will be on the menu and what kind of music the visitors will listen to.  Things are easy: to create a corporate identity, logo, website and arrange the menu.  Or this: your small oil company has been engaged in oil production and construction of oil pipelines for 40 years.  It is imperative to draw a modern and simple logo.

It is more interesting to run in virtual reality - for this you don‚Äôt even need to move. <br>  The only problem is that the more powerful the character on the screen, the stronger the atrophies of its real owner. <br>  The creators of <a href="http://www.pepup.me/">PepUp</a> tried to combine gaming excitement with real physical activity.  <a href="http://wanted.vc/blog/simple-moves/">+++</a> <br></habracut></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/124849/">https://habr.com/ru/post/124849/</a></p>
