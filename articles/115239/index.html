  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Battle for laptop</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"> Hello, Habralyudi!  In this topic I will tell my story of communication with two service centers of the city of Omsk. <br><br>  I am a happy owner of a <i>Lenovo ThinkPad Edge 14</i> laptop of the first generation, it seems that almost everyone likes me (there are certain drawbacks, but not critical for me), but it was not without surprises.  It all started with the fact that I had long felt some lack of RAM, and then, finally, I decided to buy an extra bar (good, there is one empty slot in the laptop for this).  Initially, a two-gig <i>Hynix PC3-8500</i> DDR3 strap is installed inside, I bought a <i>Samsung PC3-10600</i> strap (also two-gig).  I came home, put it in the laptop, turned it on, I was waiting for Windows to load.  I see a picture with the backlight turned off and a resolution of 640x480, as well as the following message: <br> <a title="Habraffe.ru" href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/habraeffect/6e/58/6e5808541905578cdb6988333a6d0cf7.jpg"></a> <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  First thought: before shutting down the computer, I updated the video card driver, the settings might have flown.  However, the backlight is not adjustable, the resolution cannot be set above 1024x768 (native - 1366x768).  The driver option disappears, along the way one more thing turns out - the video card disappeared as a class in the Device Manager <i>(there is no longer just ‚ÄúATI Mobility Radeon HD 4600/5100 Series‚Äù, there‚Äôs no Video Adapter class there)</i> , but the Windows memory sees everything 4 GB. <br><br>  Since it‚Äôs not the flown settings of the video driver, only the RAM gets under suspicion - after all, I haven‚Äôt changed anything else.  Moreover, it is hardly to blame for the new plank ‚Äî firstly, Samsung‚Äôs memory, with which I have had no problems since 1999, and, secondly, I bought a ‚Äúgray‚Äù slag in a decent store (RHYTHM).  The suspicion fell precisely on the fact that the slats have a different frequency, although, in my understanding, the faster one should automatically earn at a frequency slower.  I took out both slats in turn - one by one there are no problems, together <i>(including rearranging in some places)</i> - there is no video card.  Google also did not lead anywhere.

      In principle, albeit unpleasant, but the laptop and memory are still under warranty, purchased at the same store - I went to the store, found the same consultant who sold me the memory <i>(we had previously discussed with him the installation of different frequency modules )</i> , he did not have time to forget me in a day.  I explained the situation to him - he smiled <i>(they say, he had never seen anything like this, a strange problem)</i> , but he brought me another <i>slat PC3-8500</i> , and I spun the laptop right on the counter for issuing goods.  And again the same situation - singly, all three bars work fine, together - in any combination.  There is only one option - to go to the service. <br><br>  From my poor experience of communicating with service centers, I realized one truth - no one really breaks quickly to work there, and since the problem is rather unusual, the laptop will obviously have to be left, as they say, ‚Äúfor diagnostics‚Äù.  That is, for some time I will not be able to use it <i>(which is not very acceptable for me, because the working tool)</i> , and, having eliminated the problem with memory modules, the BIOS and the chipset remained under suspicion, which again does not promise a quick solution to the problem.  Therefore, I asked a question here, on Habr√©, in Q &amp; A and on the official Lenovo forum.  Described the problem in detail, but no solution was found - I had to carry it to the service. <br><br>  In the service, the laptop was accepted last Monday <i>(February 28)</i> , having believed in the word, without checking for the problem I told them about, only promising to do the work ‚Äúas soon as possible‚Äù <s>(who would doubt)</s> .  Time passed and, already on Thursday, on the Lenovo forum, in the topic I created, an answer appeared - a man with a laptop from the same series ran into a similar problem, contacted the manufacturer‚Äôs support, in which he was confirmed a bug, promising to fix it soon , and as a temporary solution, we advised to make a BIOS downgrade to an older version, in which this glitch was not noticed <i>(at the time of writing, Lenovo had already released a BIOS update to version 1.23, in which this problem was fixed)</i> .  Then, by chance, another forum was found, where people were faced with the loss of a video card after updating the BIOS on a similar laptop model, with only 4 GB of pre-installed memory.  It was already evening, and so I went to the service only the next day, explained the situation, said I wanted to pick up the laptop, to which I was told: <i>‚ÄúSince we are not an authorized service center for ThinkPad, the laptop was sent to another authorized, service. ‚Äù</i> <s>(the inscription‚Äú Authorized service center: ‚Äùand the logos of the companies, among which Lenovo is among them, hang on the wall)</s> .  I wondered where exactly my laptop was sent, got an answer, thanked and left. <br><br>  The ASC, in which my computer was now located, is called R-Style, and I accidentally stumbled upon their email address and decided, taking this opportunity <i>(I don‚Äôt lose anything)</i> , to write a letter in which I said that I had already found a solution to the problem, gave Pruflinka, brought the model and serial of the laptop, so that it was clear what was going on, told that I want to reunite with the repaired as quickly as possible, and I hope with this letter to speed up our reunion.  The answer did not take long and was received by me within five minutes <i>(they work well, I praise)</i> .  The answer was a short letter: <i>‚ÄúRepair of this laptop was closed yesterday, because</i>  <i>non-warranty problem.</i>  <i>RHYTHM should take. ‚Äù</i> I thanked for the promptness, but asked what, in their opinion, is this‚Äú non-warranty problem ‚Äù.  I was told that <i>‚Äúby specification, this model supports up to 3 GB of RAM and 500 GB HDD.</i>  <i>All the equipment is working properly, the work has not been carried out. ‚Äù</i> Funny, but what about the Edge c 4 GB of pre-installed memory on board?  Especially for them do other motherboard?  And why, if it does not support more than 3 GB, is it clearly written in my BIOS settings: <i>‚ÄúInstalled Memory: 4096 MB‚Äù</i> ?  Moreover, such a ‚Äúspecification‚Äù was not found by me either.  But okay, that's not the point - I can't even pick up the one that was not repaired. <br><br>  Next came the weekend, then March 8th, so I called RHYTHM only on this Wednesday, where I was answered by a girl who ran ‚Äúclarify‚Äù the answers to my every question and included a musical intro for a minute or two.  In the end, I received enough answers to formulate the following phrase for myself: <i>‚ÄúWhat I was told in R-Style is impossible.</i>  <i>The laptop is not ready</i> .  I again wrote a letter to R-Style, where they answered calmly again: <i>‚ÄúThe laptop is ready, I explained the reason.</i>  <i>RHYTHM can pick it up at any time. ‚Äù</i> I didn‚Äôt want to call the same girl again, so the next day I went straight to the service in order to talk to more competent people.  In the RHYTHM-service I again explained the problem, but there they told me that they could not help me, and I needed to get to the main office of the service center <i>(there are two service departments at RHYTHM)</i> , because there is no administration or any other people here that can help in this matter.  I immediately went to the main office, where I heard the words of yesterday: <i>‚ÄúYou couldn‚Äôt say such a thing!</i>  <i>The laptop is not ready yet. ‚Äù</i> I calmly replied that it didn‚Äôt matter to me whether the repair was completed or not, I haven‚Äôt been able to pick up the laptop at all for a week, and if I don‚Äôt believe that I was answered in R-Style, then I can show the story correspondence  The man immediately hesitated, but said that he could not help me with anything.  I demanded a more unequivocal answer, they say, I handed over the laptop to them, they are responsible for it too - I will ask from them, and let them figure out R-Style themselves.  I am not a big fan of fussing, but my nerves were less and less, and my speeches <i>(among other things, I stated that I was not going to leave until I received a normal answer)</i> still led to a call to R-Style, after which I heard: <i>‚ÄúYou can pick up a laptop tomorrow at around 16:00.‚Äù</i> <s>Great: the fact that ten more minutes was ‚Äúimpossible‚Äù suddenly became possible - miracles in reality!</s> <br><br>  The next day I again appeared at RHYTHM, but with the goal of getting what I wanted.  True, they gave me a laptop only at 18:00, thus being 2 hours late from my promise <i>(Fortunately, I still had some business in that area, so I had to wait less.)</i> They returned, saying that "apparently, he does not support such a volume of memory " <i>(" apparently, does not support! "And they call this diagnostics!)</i> Moreover, I was returned only a laptop, a memory bar, a guarantee for the bar.  And only when I asked, and where, in fact, my guarantee from the laptop itself, I heard: ‚ÄúWell, apparently lost.  Nothing wrong.".  Only after that I received my freshly printed guarantee. <br><br>  <b>As a result of the two-week ‚Äúbattle for the laptop‚Äù:</b> <br>  1. The terrible quality of service in the service center of the store <i>(Although, there were people who understood the situation and tried to help)</i> <br>  2. Incorrect conclusion of the ASC <br>  3. The inability to pick up the goods from the service on demand <br>  4. Incompetent "telephonists" in the store service <br>  5. The need to monitor every step of the service center <br>  6. A good store is not necessarily a good service center. <br><br>  Actually, the article was written in order to simply share my personal experience, however, somewhere in my heart I have a utopian dream that it [the article] can make the relationship between service centers and their customers a little better and kinder.  :) <br><br>  <b>PS</b> <i>After installing the BIOS update, the video card with two memory bars healed in peace and harmony, only Windows writes: "Memory: 4.00 GB (Available: 3.86 GB)", while the axis is 64-bit, there is no embedded video.</i>  <i>If someone tells you where the memory has gone, I will be grateful.</i> <br> <a title="Habraffe.ru" href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/habraeffect/e3/fe/e3fe9611c22cbb4dad6bfe3c71425a68.jpg"></a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/115239/">https://habr.com/ru/post/115239/</a></p>
