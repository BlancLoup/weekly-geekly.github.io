Part 1</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Good day! <br><br>  We position ourselves as a platform-independent company and our focus is not so much in introducing IT tools, but in attracting users to work in a new environment, building new skills, and changing user habits.  Therefore, we help our clients to choose the most suitable platform for them. <br><br>  How to compare classic IT systems?  A huge list of functionality is taken and a table is drawn.  If one of the compared systems implements this functionality - put a tick or a filled circle, if implements with reservations - put a half filled circle, if it does not, put a pass or an empty circle.  But the fact is that the corporate social network is not an ordinary IT system, it is designed to introduce new methods of teamwork and, as a result, to solve business problems not only from the top down but also from the bottom up.  This means that it is necessary to make such an interface, so that users like it.  As a result, it is necessary to 1) evaluate the functionality of the system and 2) evaluate the convenience of the end users.  Let's talk about these components in more detail. <a name="habracut"></a>

    <h2>  Comparative analysis of the functionality of platforms </h2><br>  When a customer is interested in introducing corporate social systems and does not have any specific preferences for a particular product, it is important to first understand the business purpose of using the network.  Does the customer need a combined portal with an integrated social network, or does the portal already exist and need to add a social component to it, or does the integration of the corporate social network with the workflow or corporate telephony system be required.  And so on.  Let us first consider the comparison of this particular component. <br><br>  But that's what was discovered.  It would seem that before reinventing the wheel, look on the Internet, it may have already been invented.  Offhand analysis of platforms for social communications for several years conducted such grants as Gartner, Ovum or Forrester.  But the local Russian market for them is too small and local brands are not present in the analysis.  And they are, and they have interesting developments for the Russian corporate culture. <br><br>  Well, not only Gartner or Forrester conduct a comparison of platforms, there are other, not so eminent consultants.  However, the reports we found were divided into two categories: one or another platform (here is <a href="http://yammeralternatives.com/category/enterprise-social-software/">an example</a> and <a href="http://www-01.ibm.com/software/collaboration/why-ibm/compare-enterprise-social-software.html">an example</a> ) is clearly moving forward in the first one, and in the second we have found too many inaccuracies to trust these results (here is <a href="http://www.dialogueconsulting.com.au/documents/2013/05/report-enterprise-social-networking-platform-vendor-comparison.pdf">an example</a> and <a href="http://www.r2integrated.com/digital-lab/thought-leadership/social-community-platform-comparison">an example</a> ).  In addition, each report introduces its own coordinate system and it is very problematic to combine comparative tables. <br><br>  As a result, we came to the conclusion that a comparative analysis should be carried out independently.  What did we begin to compare?  In this <a href="http://supereon.ru/blog/socialfunctions/">article,</a> we described how to compare the functionality of corporate social networks - these are the basic functions, social processes and social layer.  Since the corporate social network itself is a software platform - the issues of system management and administration within a large company become important.  Well, no one has canceled the general questions from the category of "cloud or box?" And "how much does it cost?".  As a result, we stopped at five groups of indicators: <br><br>  ¬∑ General (delivery method, prices, localization) <br><br>  ¬∑ Basic functionality <br><br>  ¬∑ Social processes <br><br>  ¬∑ Social stratum and integration <br><br>  ¬∑ Management and administration <br><br>  We also agreed for ourselves that the total number of parameters should not be too large so that the focus would not blur, but also not too small so as not to lose essence.  As a result, we formed about thirty parameters. <br><br>  Now about the choice of platforms for comparison.  We chose five platforms ‚Äî these are Jive, IBM Connections, Yammer, Bitrix24, and DaOffice.  Why exactly they?  First, in our subjective opinion, this five represents the top five sales in the Russian market.  Secondly, the first three are in the group of leaders according to consulting agencies.  Thirdly, strong Russian players have been added - Bitrix24 and DaOffice.  I apologize in advance to SAP Jam, Atlassian Confluence admirers (it seems to me that they are the closest candidates for inclusion in the list) and other manufacturers - I will be glad if you help to supplement the analysis presented below with data on these systems.  If any of you see in the inaccuracy sheet - write to us. <br><br>  Comparison table of corporate social networks: <br><br><table width="787"><tbody><tr><td width="121">  <b>Manufacturer</b> <br></td><td width="121">  <a href="http://www.jivesoftware.com/"><b>Jive software</b></a> <br></td><td width="121">  <a href="http://www.ibm.com/cloud-computing/social/ru/ru/"><b>IBM Connections</b></a> <br></td><td width="121">  <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/ru-ru/office/yammer/"><b>Yammer</b></a> <br></td><td width="121">  <a href="http://www.bitrix24.ru/"><b>Bitrix24</b></a> <br></td><td width="121">  <a href="http://www.daoffice.ru/"><b>DaOffice</b></a> <br></td></tr><tr><td width="121"></td><td width="121"></td><td width="121"></td><td width="121"></td><td width="121"></td><td width="121"></td></tr><tr><td width="121">  <b>Platform</b> <br></td><td width="121"></td><td width="121"></td><td width="121"></td><td width="121"></td><td width="121"></td></tr><tr><td width="121">  Description <br></td><td width="121">  Social intranet.

A large corporate customer already has a portal on SharePoint and is considering adding a social function to the portal, that is, it is politically incorrect to build a parallel portal, you need to add a ‚Äúclean‚Äù corporate social network.  But the security service is against a cloud-based installation.  And do not want to overpay.  From the set of parameters, we can see that in this situation, the most appropriate solution is DaOffice.  Number two is Yammer, if there are arguments for security. <br><br>  One more example.  The company is represented in Europe, Russia and the countries of the former Soviet Union, has a large number of partners and decides to streamline the communication in the partner network.  Until now, they have been communicating with partners separately, by e-mail, telephone, ICQ and Skype.  The company has a Cisco telephony system.  The most logical solution is to build a single portal for wider marketing penetration and organize feedback through the corporate social network.  Because social intranets, multilingual interfaces, and integration with Cisco are required, the Jive platform is the most preferred.
