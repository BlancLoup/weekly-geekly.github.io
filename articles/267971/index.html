  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Data Center for Health Protection</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  With the passage of time, there comes a time when the old structures become useless for their intended purpose and it‚Äôs good that there are companies that give a second life to such seemingly ordinary, but at the same time interesting objects.  That's the premise of the former <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/McRae%2527s">McRae's department store</a> in Jackson, Venyu decided to turn it into a data center.  The department store itself was opened back in 1955, and its building is listed in the National Register of Historic Places of the United States, as it was the first suburban store with the full range of services of the capital of Mississippi. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/520/fd2/c6f/520fd2c6f8824fa2bb0eaadee7173d4f.jpg"><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  After the project is completed, this will be 4 Venyu data centers with a total area of ‚Äã‚Äãover 6,200 m <sup>2</sup> .  According to preliminary estimates, the budget will be about $ 35 million. The new data center will be able to provide clients with cloud hosting, backup in the cloud, as well as collocation services.  Venya is going to build it by analogy with the already existing <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3DY71cufSzugY">Baton Rouge</a> object <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3DY71cufSzugY">(BTR2)</a> , which was opened in spring 2014.  As soon as the construction of the data center will be completed, it will be able to accommodate about 360 cabinets, it also provides for the availability of backup generators and UPS.  The object will be connected to at least three Internet providers.  According to the president of the company Venya Scott Thompson (Scotta Thompsona): <blockquote>  The new data center will be located in an ideal location, which will allow it to complement the already existing facilities of our IT infrastructure, and in the future will enable customers to use cloud services.  Venya's actions are also beneficial for the community, as it uses advanced energy-saving technologies and opens up new jobs in the region. </blockquote><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/4c4/60f/bf9/4c460fbf92f74803a993513859300610.jpg">

      The first data center customer will be the University of Mississippi Medical Center ( <a href="https://www.umc.edu/">UMMC</a> ), which will use the capabilities of the data center to provide <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telemedicine">telemedicine</a> services throughout the state.  This will allow customers to receive medical services without leaving their homes.  As Scott Thompson himself added: <blockquote>  The telemedicine program is quite successful in other states that are seeking to expand their presence in the province.  We are proud to be part of this innovative service that uses information technology to provide healthcare services virtually anywhere in the world. </blockquote><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/d23/aa5/382/d23aa53820ac463cbdc5d0e14a52bf49.jpg"><br><br>  As the project leaders assured, it will be a whole technological center that will employ about 400 residents of Mississippi.  According to statistics, the telemedicine program is conducted on average 8 thousand consultations per month.  These consultations, as a rule, go online and collect the necessary data to provide almost the entire spectrum of health services.  This program works as a virtual clinic - it includes meddiagnostics itself, as well as the treatment itself, accompanied by doctors and other specialists in this field. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/rIH8WQ58QK0" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  It's nice to see that abandoned buildings get a new round in their history.  Even more gratifying is the fact that such projects are born not only in megacities, but are realized in rather small towns by the standards of the United States.  I wonder how many such projects were implemented in the CIS, were there any?  When will we be able to proudly announce that an abandoned cultural center or the same old store has been restored, and after all, not necessarily for the needs of the information technology sector, but to begin with, at least just "reanimated"?  I want to believe that this will happen in the near future. <br><br>  UPD: Take care and be healthy! </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/267971/">https://habr.com/ru/post/267971/</a></p>
