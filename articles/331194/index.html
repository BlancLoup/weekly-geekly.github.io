  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Competence does not have gender: on gender balance and the trend of development of female coding</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  With the development of society and technology, the influence of gender stereotypes is becoming less and less: for example, one can no longer say that the traditionally male sphere of IT is ‚Äúnot for girls‚Äù.  In this article, we did not set ourselves the task of writing about the difficulties and differences in the IT industry or uncovering 10 life hacks to build a successful career for a girl coder.  Much has been written about this, by the way, one of the <a href="http://rb.ru/opinion/devushka-pishet-kod/">author‚Äôs articles</a> that inspired us to this publication.  The beautiful half is more and more involved in the technology industry and has achieved significant success there - you can argue and compare the numbers, but the trend is pointless to deny. <br><br> <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/company/efs/blog/331194/"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/fb7/48a/970/fb748a9703994c13bd3f1afbd6d2fc7a.jpg"></a> <br><br>  In this article we want to reflect with you on what will be the vector of development of this trend in the near future. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  It is noteworthy that many girls from IT do not notice gender differences in the work: men and women can be equally emotional and rational, personal characteristics are important - the ability to concentrate, solve complex problems, learn quickly.  Competence has no gender - it‚Äôs interesting, only girls themselves think so? <br>  This global trend is supported by the largest corporations: IBM, Facebook and Twitter.  Various organizations and communities, such as Women Who Code, Django Girls, Black Girls Code, Girl Develop It, She Codes, and others, regularly conduct training programs and hackathons, summer internships for girls in IT.  The Girl Geek organization brings together girls from various technical specialties, and its founder, Tammy Batou, is hosting Girl Geek Dinners in New York, where IT girls can communicate and exchange contacts in an informal setting.

      Russian companies do not stand aside either - there are more and more communities supporting female coders.  For example, Ladies Code organizes training for girls who want to develop in the field of IT.  At the municipal level in a number of regions strategic decisions are being considered in favor of the development of female coding.  Every year the number of girls entering the technical specialties increases.  In the largest domestic companies, they note that more and more women come to technical positions.  Employees share personal experience, noting that there are no particular gender differences in IT, it happens that girls themselves are afraid to go into the profession of a programmer because of the prejudice of gender inequality. <br><br><h2>  What do you think are the reasons? </h2><br>  In secular society today, women, along with men, have all the opportunities to learn the technical profession: obtaining the necessary knowledge both in theory and in practice during an internship at a leading company, cultivating personal qualities such as strength of character, dedication, flexibility and ability to achieve results . <br><br>  Skeptics will argue that even in the case of successful interviewing for most of the girls in IT, growth opportunities in the company are more modest, and the career ceiling is lower than that of a man in a similar position. <br><br>  Do you think that the statement that it‚Äôs almost impossible to achieve success and make a career as a woman‚Äôs leader is true or just another gender stereotype? <br><br>  We are confident that an enthusiastic and caring professional, possessing the necessary competencies with excellent personal qualities, will be able to achieve success and career development in any industry.  So, for example, there are many examples in the team of the United Frontal Program where girls show excellent results in the areas of development, testing and design. <br><br>  Girls come to the profession out of curiosity, with an interest in technology and a desire to learn how digital mechanisms are arranged.  Many are driven by the desire for creativity - IT is reflected today in all sectors and spheres of modern life, healthy ambitions are looking for implementation in creative projects.  An important factor is the ability to immediately see the result of their work. <br><br>  The current generation is changing and changing the surrounding foundations: the level of development of professional culture gives hope that the separation of groups on the principle of male / female - a relic that becomes yesterday. <br><br>  Do you agree with this statement?  Let's talk in the comments, we are interested in your experience. <br><br>  Perhaps among our readers or subscribers are coders with their own history? <br><br>  We are interested to know your opinion on how the trend of female coding will develop, whether it is necessary to change something and, if necessary, how to do it. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/331194/">https://habr.com/ru/post/331194/</a></p>
