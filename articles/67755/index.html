Your husband decided to go to the country without you? <br>  And you already have serious thoughts about treason, that your loved one has found and loves another? <br>  Or maybe you yourself look at other men or women as an object of desire and are afraid of these thoughts? <br>  But you do not even think that the reason may be completely different, and this very reason is due to thousands of years of evolution!  That's what scientists think about it ... <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Benjamin Franklin once joked: "Where there is marriage without love, there will be love without marriage."  His work is well known in American history; however, the truth expressed by the founder father may be directly related to the true history of evolution. <br><img align="right" src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/481/30b/34b/48130b34b7fa922139de7a5776ebae65.jpg">  Christopher Ryan (author of "Sex at Dawn") proposes to consider some considerations on the role of diversity in the sexual life of our favorite primates.  He suggests that men seek a diversity of sexual partners, and women are attracted to various techniques: <br><br>  "When the researchers considered this issue when developing the scale of sexual boredom, they found that for men, sexual boredom is associated with a variety of partners (or lack thereof), while for women, it was more related to the diversity of sexual techniques of different men .  In other words, women get more pleasure when they change their way of satisfaction, while men respond to a change in partner.  Practically everyone knows that this is true, but only a few dare to discuss it: diversity and change are a necessary element of a man‚Äôs sex life. ‚Äù <br><br>  Ryan suggested that such relationships today are the result of our evolutionary heritage.  Although I am ready to agree with his main conclusion about men (data from biology and anthropology clearly indicate that men are more concerned about quantity than quality) his conclusion about excessive male sexuality compared to female is premature.  As <a href="http://www.smartersex.org/resources/behind.asp">statistics</a> show that women are more likely to be satisfied with the relationship at any time than men, it turns out that when men are looking for new partners, they are more likely to find someone who is already busy (i.e. has a permanent relationship ). <br>  According to <a href="http://books.google.com/books%3Fid%3Dhi8E3NZ3kpUC%26pg%3DPA123%26lpg%3DPA123%26dq%3DJanus%2BReport%2Bon%2BSexual%2BBehavior%26source%3Dbl%26ots%3Dx3u0oRiKUU%26sig%3D-Ltt_74FK02K83v7AQVY5eUjQLc%26hl%3Den%26ei%3DJsKIStqNDIycMfqJ2fIO%26sa%3DX%26oi%3Dbook_result%26ct%3Dresult%26resnum%3D5">The Janus Report on Sexual Behavior,</a> 35 percent of men acknowledged at least one case of adultery, but 26 percent of women (one in four) also admitted adultery.  However, these figures should be viewed with some skepticism, since men more often exaggerate the number of sexual partners, and women more often underestimate them.  So it is quite possible that for every Vanya pikaper who removes girls on the dance floor, there is Katia, who loves free relationships, follows him step by step. <br>  In the same way as having multiple partners can be part of a male nature, the same is true for women.  On average, 10% of children worldwide appear as a result of adultery.

    <blockquote>  Since sex with different men differs in quality ... and is readily available with men belonging to different social groups, women have the opportunity to instruct the horns of their partners, and sometimes still benefit from it. <br></blockquote><br>  It turns out that while the evolutionary strategy of a man involves many sexual partners, the female strategy is the desire to increase the genetic diversity of the offspring.  Women have the opportunity to have children from different partners, or even to receive material support from several fathers at the same time ... <br><br>  In the comments to the article of Ryan, a lot of people expressed their indignation at the fact that any infidelity can be justified by the roots in human evolution. <br><img align="left" width="260" height="250" src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/9c1/614/a52/9c1614a5252ab27e47828767d73bf9ba.jpg">  In order to understand the nature of human relationships, one can consider animal related species.  Chimpanzees and bonobos (their DNA corresponds to approximately 99% human) have a free mating system.  Females have sex with several males from their group and choose males that they like more.  The evolution of sexual jealousy in nascent form can be observed in chimpanzees, when a low-ranking male is caught mating with a female chosen by a high-ranking male.  Restlessness in the forest becomes after that.  Bonobos have a slightly different situation.  Females mainly give signals for mating, in order to show the males that they are ready to accept partners.  In the primate world, there is a rivalry between males and each other in what biologists call "sperm competition."  Large volumes of ejaculate are prepared to ‚Äúwash out‚Äù the semen of the previous male.  The large ratio of testicle size to body size is a strong factor indicating a free mating system. <br><br>  In contrast, the gorillas live in the so-called harem system and in large males the testicles are so small that it is even difficult for anatomists to simply find them.  This happens because there is no pressure from competing males and their reproductive system produces a sufficient amount of ejaculate (however, this does not mean that females mate always only with their harem leader :)).  Gibbons are monogamous monkeys, and accordingly have small testes relative to the size of their bodies.  In all these cases, the primate mating system can be determined by the size of their testicles. <br><br>  So, the facts considered lead to an obvious question: are people closer to chimpanzees and bonobos or gibbons and gorillas?  Specifically, as might be expected from genetic similarities, human testicles are large, like those of chimpanzees and bonobos.  In fact, in their analysis of the seed genes <a href="http://www.springerlink.com/content/3k7e7aqxtrkfv5qr/">SEMG1</a> and <a href="http://www.nature.com/ng/journal/v36/n12/abs/ng1471.html">SEMG2</a> , Sarah Kingan and Steve Dorus found a direct relationship between the average number of sexual partners in women and the evolution of these genes in men.  The human being is closer to chimpanzees and bonobos, and this clearly indicates that humans evolved with a free mating system. <br><br>  In the anthropological literature, this structure is also visible, <a href="http://www.jstor.org/pss/2744379%2522">83% of pre-industrial societies</a> are classified as polygamous (one man marrying several women), and the infidelity of spouses is quite common.  In many societies, women adhere to a ‚Äúpolygamous motherhood‚Äù strategy, in which a woman will have children from several men, and receive support from each of them.  As Miriam Seetzen writes in his book ‚ÄúPolygamy‚Äù: <br><blockquote><img align="right" width="240" height="310" src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/ef0/987/80a/ef098780a974cb9afd34114f74fe69e5.jpg">  A woman has only one husband, but there may be several men who have recognized their fatherhood, thus she has the opportunity to effectively manage several men at once.  Since these men are usually associated with different clans, their children have access to other related networks, thereby optimizing the access of the woman and her children to the resources available to the families of relatives. </blockquote><br>  After examining various arguments that support the violent behavior of men, Ryan asks the following question: <br><br>  ‚ÄúIf men have evolved over millions of years in search of sexual novelty (which avoids genetic stagnation in small groups in sparsely populated areas of the planet), then are we fair to condemn them for their exorbitant appetites?‚Äù <br>  This is a fair question, however, it is necessary to consider its other side.  Every man who wants to justify his self-indulgence with his secretary should also ask himself if he is ready to help her raise her son? <br><br>  Although this does not mean that all men or women will deceive their partners, it turns out sex is the main cause of happy or unhappy relationships.  According to the <a href="http://a.abcnews.com/Primetime/PollVault/Story%3Fid%3D156921%26page%3D4">ABC News</a> survey <a href="http://a.abcnews.com/Primetime/PollVault/Story%3Fid%3D156921%26page%3D4">,</a> men go to the left to meet sexual needs, but women do the same to satisfy emotional needs.  Satisfaction in sexual life is the best indicator of successful relationships: <br><blockquote>  Regression analysis shows that sexual satisfaction is a good predictor of a successful marriage.  Although the direction of communication in regression analysis is sometimes difficult to establish, it is more likely that satisfaction with sex generates satisfaction in marriage than vice versa.  This follows from the fact that more people are satisfied with marriage than the number of people who are satisfied with their sex life.  If marital satisfaction would lead to satisfaction in sex, this gap between the two groups of people would not exist. </blockquote><br>  While Benjamin Franklin moved to France to brighten up his life with love, for those who are not satisfied - but do not want to lie to their partners - there is a growing movement seeking alternatives to deception.  Books on open marriage and polygamy are becoming popular in large bookstores across Europe and the United States.  If indeed several partners are the norm for a person, openness and honesty about personal needs is the best approach.  Reproaches of moral promiscuity stumble upon deaf walls, as people in modern society approach the sexual habits that have existed in our species for thousands of years, that is, before a civilization created by religious canons. <br><br>  PS: Those who are so actively minus, do not be lazy, leave comments!  ;) <br><br></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/67755/">https://habr.com/ru/post/67755/</a></p>
