  <section class="page js-page"><h1>How to pass a stress test for a job interview</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  The best defense is attack.  Do you want to put an HR manager in shock?  Then ask a series of questions at the interview: <br><br><ul><li>  <b>What software company sells</b> .  The question is particularly relevant if the company is not IT or is working for an outsourcing.  If the HR-manager doesn‚Äôt get stuck, ask to spell the name, enter into the communicator and pretend to read the output upon request.  Pushing your lips and shaking your head will give more charm. </li><li>  <b>How much will they pay?</b>  Is white salary?  Social Security?  Business travelers?  If this is not enough, ask for a typical employee salary growth schedule for the next 10 years.  Any attempts at evasion, such as "depends on how you will cope with the work," stop at the root - experience and loyalty have their price and must be paid. </li><li>  <b>Is there a driver vacancy?</b>  This question is better to ask when it is already clear that you are ready to take.  Explain that you have very good performance on arrivals in Nf Es and you want to repeat them in real life.  Say EnFeEs as calmly as a ‚Äúsandwich‚Äù.  Exercise should look natural. </li><li>  <b>How many months will I go to the board of directors?</b>  Say that you are very ambitious, and plan to sit down on your department head / leader next week.  Take an interest in hobbies Gender, tops.  Promise that <i>thank</i> .  At the same time, look straight into your eyes - you must be confident and domineering. </li><li>  <b>Can I go to work in a couple of months?</b>  Say that you still have a number of offers and you want to choose the best place to give yourself, your beloved, the best company.  It would be nice to print on a color printer business cards with logos of famous companies and accidentally drop them.  Lift and say, came here on the way to the interview, invited. </li><li>  <b>Ask for an advance!</b>  At the same time show that you are only interested in money, and nothing more.  To the question - what kind of work, tell me - did I come to you, waste my time and strain, why not work?  You can also include shipping costs. </li><li>  <b>Who called the company so stupid?</b>  Say that the company name should be in Russian (if it is English) and vice versa.  Claim that it is more prestigious and you must keep the image.  Ask again - who gave the name.  If the HR-manager cannot give an answer, then reproach that the employee should know more about the history of his company! </li><li>  <b>What is included in medical insurance?</b>  Report that you have long dreamed of plastic surgery at the expense of the company and very much hope for it.  Ask how quickly you can go for an operation after going to work. </li><li>  <b>What is the break for a counter?</b>  Ask HR if he is a man.  If a woman - ask if there is a break to view porn sites.  Say that you recently quit smoking and need periodic relaxation. </li><li>  <b>What is better to go?</b>  Tell me you're from the other side of town.  Ask which team - female or male?  If feminine - smile fondly, if masculine - say that fishing without vodka is impossible. </li><li>  <b>What is the operating system of the owner?</b>  If Windows - say contemptuously - Vendus.  If MacOS, then complain that the Macophiles have plotted.  If Linux - ask about the color of his eyes, and tell me if they are really red. </li></ul><br><br>  And remember - in every joke only a fraction of the joke.  Good luck in your job interviews! </div>
