  <section class="page js-page"><h1>How I taught e-commerce in high school (part 1, preparation for the semester)</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  After graduating from high school in the summer of 2009, I was quite naturally upset, having decided that I would never return to the alma mater.  A lot was connected with the institute in my life: I always actively participated in various conferences, I worked as a methodologist for two junior courses, helped with exhibitions and other events ... e-commerce course?  Of course, I wanted to.  Apparently, there were no other volunteers, as I was given classes on Saturday, so that I could keep up with the main work, and even agreed to turn a blind eye to the likely departures on business trips, with the condition that I report all the required hours. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  So, I got a stream from two groups of undergraduates.  The groups were of different specialties - ‚ÄúApplied Informatics (in Economics)‚Äù and ‚ÄúComputers, Complexes, Systems and Networks‚Äù.  I will make a reservation that the discipline that I taught is not included in the mandatory list according to the standards of these specialties, being the so-called.  "Component of the choice of the university."  For this reason, only a test is taken at the end of the course, not an exam.  However, this affects little the seriousness of the attitude towards discipline among students. <br>  The full official name of "my" discipline is "E-commerce application development".  Alas, I knew the level of students at my university and I didn‚Äôt doubt for a minute that we wouldn‚Äôt have to do development, 3-5 students in the stream are capable of it, the rest will have to chew the basics in the literal sense of the word.  Therefore, I decided to focus on those students whose level is ‚Äúabove average‚Äù.  My plan was this: it is they who come to classes, but we will do what they heard and know about, but have not yet systematized their knowledge and skills.  The rest, if desired, are fully capable of catching up in the process.  Thus, the course from ‚ÄúDevelopment‚Äù turned, in fact, into just ‚ÄúE-commerce‚Äù.  In addition, since the course was not of the standard, I could afford decent freedoms in the course content ‚Äî that is, explain what was interesting to me and the students without being constrained by the ‚Äútypical curriculum‚Äù framework.  Our course was supposed to last one semester, it was supposed to spend two pairs every week.  Before the start of classes, I didn‚Äôt bother to write a dull curriculum, limiting myself to a mindmap with sketches and relying more on impromptu: <br><img src="http://www.ak-74u.ru/wp-content/uploads/e-commerce-mindmap.png" alt="image"><br>  As you can see, I determined the approximate content of the e-commerce course quite liberally.  Such liberty is dictated by the goal: to reduce the level of ignorance among relatively weak listeners, while affecting a small part of purely economic issues that were not covered in the core disciplines.  The fact that they were not affected, I knew, as a graduate of this university.  This knowledge gap was, of course, particularly flagrant, for students of the specialty Applied Informatics. <br>  Having outlined all of this (of course, there might be a lot of questions for the mind-mapping, but this is nothing more than writing in the style of ‚Äúwhat it would be good for us to talk about‚Äù), I proceeded to study the available textbooks of different degrees of obsolescence.  The main emphasis in them was placed on classic online stores and payment systems, which was reflected in my ‚Äúplan‚Äù by red flags.  Actually, the textbooks were quickly left by me and I went on to read the original sources :) <br>  Refreshing and ordering a little knowledge, I wrote a rough summary of the first lecture.  Before the first lesson I was very worried, despite the experience of school teaching (as a student, I taught computer science at school for half a year).  On the night of the first Saturday of the semester, the following questions didn‚Äôt let me fall asleep: ‚ÄúHow would senior students accept me who graduated from the same university just a year ago?‚Äù, ‚ÄúIs the lecture outline too primitive or complicated?‚Äù during the lecture? ‚Äù, and, finally, the panic problem‚Äú How to behave at all ?! ‚Äù. <br><br>  The continuation in which I will talk about the first lecture, the first lab, relationships with students, as well as problems and discoveries during the semester and much more, I hope, will follow.  If this is interesting to someone;) Simply put, to write or not to write? </div>
