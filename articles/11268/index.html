  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Is it necessary to cultivate willpower</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"><h3>  or why I do not want to be an Indian? </h3>  <i>Everyone knows that real Indians do not cry.</i>  <i>Because they have a strong will and strong character.</i>  <i>Another strong will is among the captured partisans, the conquerors of Everest and General Karbyshev.</i>  <i>But this is all extreme.</i>  <i>And how in ordinary life?</i>  When I was little, my ears just buzzed that strong will was an essential attribute of a real man.  Strong will means that if you decide to do something difficult or unpleasant, you will definitely do it.  For example, he said that you would not smoke or smoke.  Or, instead of playing football, you will learn lessons all day.  And who can not do that, he wimps and a rag. <a name="habracut"></a>  But once I grew up and realized that I was not destiny for an Indian.  I can not force myself to do any garbage.  It seems to be necessary, but it is impossible.  Do not lay the soul in the apartment clean up - hired a housekeeper.  I don‚Äôt want to study English with my child (teaching at school sucks) - the child goes to the tutor.  And the child is pleased and the tutor, and as I am pleased - not to retell.  A solid win - win. And I thought, maybe this is not laziness and not weakness, but simply the subconscious suggests that you should not do all this, do not go to the result through rape of your nerves and body throws on the embrasure.  It may be necessary not to overcome obstacles, but simply to remove them from my path? How many times I forced myself to do something - it was always garbage.  Now I do this.  When I don‚Äôt want something, I sit down and write what I think about this, literally everything that comes to mind.  Sometimes I start laughing in a couple of minutes.  Obstinacy, children's fears, offenses do not allow to do something good and necessary.  Laugh and go do.  This is a simple option, but more often it happens, for example, like this: I love my daughter and I love English, but it‚Äôs impossible to combine the unpleasant with the useless.  There is no sign of zytyable in our country. Why am I starting to get angry and scream if nothing threatens me?  A whole sheet was written up and came to a paradoxical conclusion.  Even ashamed at first was.  The conclusion is: I do not need it.  Personally, I do not need to practice English with my child.  For me, this makes no sense, but the fact that she knew English is the meaning.  Because I found a tutor.  And I better tell my daughter about Bruce Springsteen.  Not Dima Bilan to listen all the time. In view of the fact that I don‚Äôt participate in hostilities and I don‚Äôt run amok on Everest, it turned out that I don‚Äôt need strength of will and there is no reason to force me.  And, in general, over the years you begin to understand that old wisdom that everything should be done easily and joyfully.  Easy - does not mean without effort, cost and tension.  It should be easy on the heart.  Because you are doing what you want, and not something that someone should not understand. As for willpower, you still need to educate her.  And then suddenly a war in which you can not force yourself not to participate? </div>
