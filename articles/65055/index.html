Technologies on railway transport</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/e3f/96b/e0f/e3f96be0fad5d540bf301c0471a0b453.jpg" alt="image"></div><br>  Good evening!  We all live somewhere and go to someone.  Someone goes home, someone for a walk, someone for work ... One takes a couple of minutes to travel, another takes a couple of days.  I think many will agree with me that traveling long distances is very good on the train, very good, but not always convenient ... <br>  By the nature of my work, I often go on business trips and it is by train, and since I am a railroad worker, it would be a sin not to travel in a compartment car))). <br>  As they say, you quickly get used to good things, so, having rolled a year in ‚Äúkupeshki‚Äù, they didn‚Äôt suit me anymore (who would have thought the student was a normal student) ... for the time being. <br>  As it turned out, quite recently a new compartment carriage appeared in the park of the Belarusian Railway.  And my joy has no chapel. <a name="habracut"></a><br>  <i>Wait until the pictures are fully downloaded and continue ...</i> <br>  Well then let's start in order: <br>  ‚Ä¢ The first thing that catches your eye is that the windows in the compartment are simply not meant to be opened (. One single glass pane, <br><img src="http://i055.radikal.ru/0907/54/05d9ff5d3ea7.jpg" alt="image"><br>  The glass unit is large, so there is always enough light in the compartment, for example, to read a book. <br>  ‚Ä¢ The function of airing now performs such a modern thing as air conditioning.  Therefore, there is a risk of waking up from the cold, even when overboard is +35 (tested by personal experience)))) <br>  ‚Ä¢ The next thing that catches our eye is small personalized fixtures.  Now This is a halogen, which shines much brighter and about which you do not beat your head.  See for yourself, the photo from the discharge was-became <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/36a/36e/bd3/36a36ebd372df51c7c4362d0dbbccdd8.jpg" alt="image"><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/264/ad1/c79/264ad1c79b36675a144b3534521942f3.jpg" alt="image"><br>  Now I‚Äôm just sure that this is the number 9 (unlike the previous topic about <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/atnikvariat/65003/">‚ÄúByte‚Äù</a> ) <br>  ‚Ä¢ The seats are now very soft and now very light.  The backs have become larger in size and also added softness <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/a3c/9d7/b08/a3c9d7b08e069999531b9b294c42306b.jpg" alt="image"><br><img src="http://s12.radikal.ru/i185/0907/bf/88a54b998cac.jpg" alt="image"><br>  ‚Ä¢ The coupe has become a bit more spacious in length, so long guys will understand me.  I place myself with my 193cm, and you can also throw the bag at your feet (small though) <br>  ‚Ä¢ Those who always like to fall from the top shelf are offered such a built-in wonder device) <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/0c3/de3/d97/0c3de3d97b9f5aa0845abf57cfd94897.jpg" alt="image"><br>  ‚Ä¢ The top shelves are just as good. <br><img src="http://i069.radikal.ru/0907/4c/e092b03e4b33.jpg" alt="image"><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/888/3ed/47c/8883ed47c7b5a9e16bf391e3578aab1b.jpg" alt="image"><br>  And did you notice that in the previous photo above the doorway ... finally, here, you can tell what I was bringing in this article ... <br>  ‚Ä¢ Now in each compartment there is a small information and control center <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/b8d/1ff/efc/b8d1ffefc3d4449aa49e98279b431181.jpg" alt="image"><br>  A little more: <br>  1) the socket - well, what is so unusual here, but take a closer look, now, besides a razor, you can insert recharging into a mobile phone and even a laptop.  It is worth adding that in the old cars it was simply forbidden, and, sometimes, when the conductor had a bad mood, then he was punished).  Now it is absolutely legal. <br>  2) the glory from the outlet itself is the information control panel.  Touch switching of lighting modes (only 3 modes of intensity and turning off the light), calling the conductor, etc. From the information one is awareness of the toilet‚Äôs free state <br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/e3f/96b/e0f/e3f96be0fad5d540bf301c0471a0b453.jpg" alt="image"></div><br>  We see now that the left is occupied, and the right is free))))))).  So much for usability! <br>  Well then, turn right and visit this room: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/a0a/520/818/a0a5208181296a9ba30ed98ced60d2f6.jpg" alt="image"><br>  Neatly, neatly ... <br>  Well, the next frame <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/bf6/312/93e/bf631293e5a3da3729a171240e7ad6b9.jpg" alt="image"><br>  For those who cannot read the tablet from below, I‚Äôll briefly inform you that it‚Äôs now, yes, yes, it‚Äôs now vacuum, dumb, but unusual.  At least I still have the impression that something is missing, namely the pedals, now space technology has reached the ground).  Where everything disappears, it is not clear))))) <br>  In conclusion, I want to say that there are not many such cars, I would even say a little.  So most often in one direction you go in a new one, back in a regular car. <br>  The price of a ticket from Minsk to Gomel in such a car is about 26'000 BYR ($ 9).  I do not know for sure; I ride for free;) <br>  Thanks for reading to the end, I tried </div>
