In the evening of this day they were already at 45-48.  In the chat, everyone is shocked, they write off on April 1 and other absurdities.  On the afternoon of April 2, they settled down for 60 rubles, but ... <img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/25b/1b1/879/25b1b1879bd524518cb04d078b8b6826.png">

      The volume of litecoin <a href="https://www.bit-trader.net/litecoin-passes-8-5-million-usd-in-24hr-trading/">exceeded $ 8.5 million.</a> In less than a day, <a href="https://www.bit-trader.net/litecoin-passes-5-million-usd-in-24hr-trading/">$ 5 million was reported.</a> On April 1, there was <a href="https://www.bit-trader.net/litecoin-passes-2-1-million-usd-in-24hr-trading/">only $ 2.1 million.</a> <br>  Why such a jump?  My opinion is speculation and the desire of people to cash in on litecoin, since they missed the growth of bitcoin.  Began to spread the rumor that once bitcoin has grown so much, then all other cryptocurrencies should also creep up sharply.  On this occasion, the number of users has increased dramatically, which resulted in a huge influx of money and an even greater demand for litecion. <br><br>  The horror itself was going on from about 19:30 to 22:00.  The number of guests exceeded 10,000. The number of registered online users reached 5,000. According to the administration‚Äôs assurances, DDoS began.  The site went to bed. <a name="habracut"></a>  A second before this, the price of litecoin was already about 88 rubles apiece.  The site was interrupted.  Many have not been credited to the account.  Chaos reigned.  Instant buying began, no one was looking at the prices.  Literally in 3 minutes the cost jumped up to 150 rubles.  They gave up nerves, in the head, stumbling over each other, thoughts were running ‚ÄúWhat to do?  What will happen next?  Merge or wait? ".  By this time, the sales offers were almost exhausted, orders with the amount from 200 to 500 remained. Nobody wanted to sell.  After about 10 seconds, the first bids for 140 appeared, after which the cost began to fall.  For some time, the price ranged from 120 to 140. We recall yesterday morning - 20 rubles.  An increase of 650% for two days.  In the mind we count the number of missed apartments and cars.  Our view again falls on current offers.  We wait.  Another jump, this time flying down.  Half a minute drain to 90, linger for a couple of seconds, re-purchase and flew up.  We blow the fallen gray hair off the table, they won't be useful to us anymore.  After 20-25 minutes, the exchange begins to work quickly and without failures, everything returns to normal.  Here is a graph with a jump in numbers: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/26a/191/c7a/26a191c7a6a1581119c87fd02c96dd8e.png"><br>  At the moment, the course is 133-136 rubles for one litecoin.  The maximum sale is still at 160. The LTC / RUR sales volume on this exchange is 198,711 LTC / 15,318,008 RUR. <br><br>  What will happen next?  Unknown.  Such an inadequate price increase may well lead to a fall.  If the rumors are confirmed, MtGox will start supporting litecoin and prices will soar 3-4 times the current state.  If not, then most likely - a collapse, because such growth is not supported by anything. <br><br>  <b>PS</b> If, after reading it, you suddenly decided to buy litecoin, and the course will fall sharply after your purchase, you should not blame anyone but yourself. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/175199/">https://habr.com/ru/post/175199/</a></p>
