  <section class="page js-page"><h1>What to do with a very heavy idea?</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  One question has long plagued me.  I indirectly touch him in my ‚Äústart-up‚Äù notes, starting with ‚Äú <a href="http://www.itechbridge.com/forum/index.php%3Fshowtopic%3D38897">Curved mirrors of the business plan</a> ‚Äù and ‚Äú <a href="http://www.itechbridge.com/forum/index.php%3Fshowtopic%3D52011">Start-up or Down</a> ‚Äù, and ending with ‚Äú <a href="http://www.itechbridge.com/forum/index.php%3Fshowtopic%3D124058">Flights in a dream and reality</a> ‚Äù. <br><br>  This question, like everything I‚Äôm thinking about in this series of notes, has been missed through my own experience in startup-based walking.  Therefore, I would not like to illustrate the problem, which will be discussed here, with my projects.  And then, quite accidentally, one user Habrahabr came to the rescue with a very impressive pseudonym BillGates. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h4>  And he sees the eye ... </h4><br>  In the comments to my last <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/pure_content/50314">‚Äúcloudy‚Äù note,</a> BillGates asked my opinion about the prospects of one of his ideas.  Since the discussion was open, I think that I have the right to refer to my counterpart (I quote verbatim): <br><br>  <i>‚ÄúHow difficult is it to raise your service like Amazon.com AWS or Windows Azure?</i>  <i>Suppose there is a big interesting socially significant project that does not pull the budget of $ 50k for hosting, but wants to attract the help of its users with their computers.</i>  <i>Is it possible to organize a project like SETI, but only applicable to hosting? ‚Äù</i>

      I beg you of the readers of this article not to start discussing technical details, originality, feasibility and the problem of monetization of the idea of ‚Äã‚ÄãBill Gates habravsky.  Let me remind you once again that I brought his question only to illustrate what I want to say.  We assume that the author of this concept has provided you with all the evidence of the viability of his proposal.  So, ... <br><br>  In a very generalized form, the classical sequence of stages through which any future Bill Gates must pass <a href="http://www.itechbridge.com/forum/index.php%3Fshowtopic%3D56893">can be represented as</a> : (1) idea, (2) team, (3) BP + TK, (4) investment, (5) implementation, (4 ) implementation and, perhaps, (5) sale of the business. <br><br>  But tell me what to do with your idea already to our "Bill Gates"?  After all, after a short discussion, we came to a common and quite unambiguous conclusion that only giants of the IT market can bring such things under force.  No author of the idea, be he at least seven spans in the forehead, no arbitrarily powerful team of any startup will ever master the system of cloud crowdsourcing.  Even the most ideal business plan with the most magnificent concept of monetization will not help him here. <br>  So, to your main question ... <br><br>  What can be advised to the author of a ‚Äúbrilliant‚Äù idea, which theoretically can ‚Äúturn the world‚Äù (or even a very small part of this world), if it has quite acceptable initial components according to p.  1-3, but very well he himself realizes that for him it is very heavy?  The reason for "inadequacy" in this case is not important.  The above example is just an illustration of one of the options. <br><br>  ‚ÄúSimple‚Äù investors, not to mention the so-called business developers, with any of the options will torture the author of a very heavy idea with axioms like ‚Äú <a href="http://www.itechbridge.com/forum/index.php%3Fshowtopic%3D123209">simpler, faster, cheaper</a> ‚Äù, but they will not give money anyway.  And rightly so, they will not give ... <br><br>  <i>So what does the author do very heavy idea?</i> <br>  In an abbreviated version of the text that you have just read, very <a href="http://professionali.ru/Topic/485036">actively discussed</a> (more than 120 comments) the community ‚ÄúStart-up‚Äù in professionali.ru.  And you know, with almost zero result.  Mostly common maxims - tips from the alphabet of start-up business, which you can easily find in any textbook and on any web resource dedicated to this topic.  As soon as using an example in one of my final comments, I clarified what I mean by an ‚Äúextremely heavy idea,‚Äù most of the participants were immediately silenced.  It is difficult to discuss specifics, which, well, does not fit into the Procrustean bed of classical schemes.  General words and all known axioms will not work here. <br><br>  The example I gave to my interlocutors was somewhat impersonal, so to speak.  I did not want to reduce the conversation to technical details, although already in the course of the discussion itself there appeared a description of a few more overwhelming ideas. <br><br><h4>  How to sell a very heavy idea? </h4><br>  However, the dry residue, or, as Americans like to say, ‚Äúbottom line‚Äù still appeared to me.  Albeit very indirectly, but manifested.  What conclusions did I draw from the conversation?  Again, they were very actively discussed in another of my speeches in professionali.ru.  My second speech is called <a href="http://professionali.ru/Topic/515319">How to sell a very heavy idea?</a>  ".  You can read it there and even connect to the discussion.  However, this can be done even faster in my iTech Bridge, a blog that publishes the <a href="http://www.itechbridge.com/forum/index.php%3Fshowtopic%3D133749">full version of a note</a> , the first section of which you have already read.  By the way, in the course of the discussion, six ‚Äúvery heavy ideas‚Äù were presented to the ‚Äúprofessionals‚Äù, one of which, codenamed ‚Äúthe exchange of ideas‚Äù, at any moment can turn out to be quite lifting ... <br><br>  PS I simultaneously place similar options for notes in various places. I combine business with pleasure - I research expediency and look for mechanisms for organizing cross-discussions. <br><br>  PS2 Recently, I received a letter from one of my habrachitelchik, who wrote me toli sincerely, toli with a sneer: " <i>I consider it my duty to thank you for your ideas, expressed in the blog" intelligent web ", because most likely I will use some of them expressed in sure, the legendary post ‚Äúmy space, which I am looking for.</i>  "So, if someone suddenly sees again in this article quite lifting ideas for themselves, I give them to my readers just for thanks :). <br><br>  <i>So, the <a href="http://www.itechbridge.com/forum/index.php%3Fshowtopic%3D133749">full text of the notes ....</a></i> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/51088/">https://habr.com/ru/post/51088/</a></p>
