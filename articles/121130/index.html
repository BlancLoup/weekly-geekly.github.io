And now they have already appeared in Russia. <br><br>  Going to the demonstration of new products in the Moscow office of Sony Ericsson, I carefully read not only a press release about new products, but also my last year‚Äôs comparative review of the previous generation of this model - Sony Ericsson Xperia X10 mini and mini pro.  And what can I say after the rapid test of new ‚Äúminek‚Äù? <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/338daf25/8861976b/d0a500bc/d45839f7.jpg">

      They did not lose the main thing, retaining a compact size, and at the same time acquired a lot of new properties that allow them to rightfully be called the proud word ‚Äúsmartphone‚Äù.  Full and very powerful.  Only ma-a-a-scarlet. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a><h4>  Appearance and ergonomics </h4><br>  Yes, both models are still ‚Äúmini‚Äù: the dimensions, compared with the previous generation, have increased by a few millimeters - to 88x52x16 mm and 92x53x18 mm in mini and mini pro, respectively. <br>  The screen which is inscribed in these forms and enlarged to 3 ‚Äùdiagonally occupies almost the entire front panel of the phone, leaving only thin frames around. <br><br>  Hard buttons became less - only Home button, Back and Menu left now - touch.  In general, the appearance of smartphones has become stricter, clearer and more concise.  The idea is clear: a small phone is not necessary for women.  It is just for those who need a small smartphone (or do not need a large one - options are possible). <br><br>  By the way, it was precisely in connection with this model that I already recalled a joke just a few years ago about ‚Äúthe only thing about which men argue is who has less‚Äù. <br><br>  And it is still pleasant to hold them in my hands: last year I wrote that ‚Äúthe <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/sonyericsson/blog/109438/">tactile sensations from the‚Äú expensive ‚Äùsoft matte plastic are quite on the level</a> ‚Äù - the new models did not change the traditions in this respect: the back covers of both models are made of soft-touch plastic, soft and expensive to touch.  But besides the wow effect, this plastic carries one more very original practical benefit: it can ‚Äútighten wounds‚Äù, which was shown to me in practice - a small intentional scratch on the back cover was rubbed with a finger in a few seconds.  In everyday life, such "injuries" will disappear altogether unnoticed. <br><br>  Another nice feature of the Xperia mini layout is the audio jack on the bottom of the case.  As practice shows, the phone is usually thrust into the pocket with a ‚Äúhead forward‚Äù, therefore such an arrangement of the connector can be considered optimal, especially for a compact model - for those who have skinny jeans, they will especially appreciate it. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/ad2a5c35/f84bb0ef/41494168/1b89c156.jpg"><br><br>  And a good tradition is almost all new Xperia - access to the memory card slot can be obtained without removing the battery, so you can now change the memory without rebooting the phone.  Included with the phone is a 2 gig memory card, so probably it does not hurt. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/d066f513/d3709b24/43d3d958/1cb4b63e.jpg"><br><br><h4>  Interface </h4><br>  One of the main features of the compact smartphone concept of the last generation mini was the ability to control it with one hand, literally with one thumb. <br><br>  For this, a special ‚Äúcorners interface‚Äù was developed, in which the labels of the 4 most frequently used applications were located at the corners of the screen. <br><br>  In the new generation, the idea has been developed: now in each "corner" four "fighters" can hide - the set of icons opens like a fan when clicked.  In total, it turns out, you can place up to 16 shortcuts on the desktop. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/cda3a142/060ef36a/4eae7006/3cb23b9e.png"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/c7df9252/9df40a29/6631133f/f292a6c3.png"><br><br>  Coupled with five desktop screens and an increased screen resolution of 320x480, this drastically expands the capabilities and ease of controlling your smartphone - with the same dimensions, I remind you. <br><br><h4>  Engine and camera </h4><br>  Needless to say, all this simply ‚Äúflies‚Äù in a compact mini case - because inside it is the same Xperia arc with its 1-gigartz Qualcomm 8255 Snapdragon process and Android 2.3 Gingerbread OS <br>  The camera is also ‚Äúlike the big ones‚Äù - with 5 MP with autofocus, the function of ‚Äúcatching‚Äù the moment of a smile and a full gentlemanly set of options (8x digital zoom, autofocus, face detection, flash, geo-tags, image stabilization and red-eye removal ). <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/3cbe8f6f/ee9c409c/e89b01e2/d4895cd3.jpg"><br><br><h4>  Facebook inside </h4><br>  Even in the models of last year, the application of ‚Äúbooksellers‚Äù was necessarily present.  This year, starting with mini and mini pro models, Sony Ericsson is expanding the integration of the service into the shell of its products: Facebook inside Xperia integrates the social network with the basic functions of the smartphone, providing direct access to the Facebook service from the most frequently used applications, such as an image gallery , music player, phone book and calendar.  Now you can ‚Äúzaylakat‚Äù photo or track right when viewing / listening to it on the phone. <br>  Only some discrimination of Twitter users is saddened - even the client is not allowed by default, and there is nothing to say about such deep integration.  Well, and, probably, there will be those who will be upset by the lack of deep penetration of Vkontakte :) <br><br><h4>  Xperia mini pro keyboard </h4><br>  The most important innovation: despite the previous dimensions, the number of keys has increased - 4 buttons have been added, and now the mini pro keyboard has a full block of arrow keys, the button for switching the layout and the semicolon are now in lower case. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/1dbba2ff/eb944e52/f4798b87/1f1cdc98.jpg"><br><br>  Unfortunately, the Russian layout still does not fit entirely - the letters X, F, U and Kommersant are in upper case.  But it does not cause big problems.  Most importantly, the keys are just as comfortable: they are the same size, still separate and convex.  It is very convenient to type and, with due skill, it is quite possible to do it blindly - you will not miss. <br><br>  The Type &amp; Send function, which debuted on the recently introduced Xperia pro (without the mini prefix), allows you not to bother opening the application before typing a message - type and then choose where to send - via SMS, to Facebook or post to Twitter. <br><br>  From the differences of mini pro, you can still highlight a brighter screen, which is clearly seen in the photo in the dark: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/f1a4d881/6feeb3c1/5ce3d183/16b99e25.jpg"><br><br><h4>  Subtotals </h4><br>  So, let's summarize what's new in the Sony Ericsson Xperia mini: <br><ul><li>  The ability to record video in HD format is now the world's smallest smartphone with such capabilities. </li><li>  Familiar with other new products of this year, Reality Display technology combined with Mobile BRAVIA Engine technology. </li><li>  Updated corners interface </li><li>  Facebook inside Xperia </li></ul>  Xperia mini pro is also different: <br><ul><li>  An updated keyboard with lots of keys </li><li>  Type &amp; Send function </li></ul><br><h4>  Summary </h4><br>  Left in their dimensions, both smartphones have matured considerably.  Have they lost anything compared to previous generations?  Well, except that the prefix X10 in the title.  At the level remained dimensions and - it is important!  - price.  There are no exact prices for our market yet, but it will be the most affordable smartphone presented this year in the Xperia lineup.  Competitive price, adult filling and unique in its class dimensions - these twins will find a buyer.  Maybe they will be exactly you?  ;) <br><br>  <b>PS</b> You can <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/sonyericsson/">subscribe to our blog</a> and be the first to find out news, read tests and reviews of gadgets from Sony Ericsson. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/121130/">https://habr.com/ru/post/121130/</a></p>
