Change means progress.  Changes mean that you have learned something new and started to act.  Being open to change is the first rule that you need to learn in order to successfully integrate into the culture of a startup ... and it was my biggest stumbling block when I first started working at <a href="http://socialtables.com/">Social Tables</a> . <br><br>  My dislike for change comes from always wanting to do everything right the first time.  I used to think that change means that you were wrong initially, and you have to go back to correct your mistake.  Take this thinking, add a healthy dose of stubbornness, and you will get a recipe for disaster among startup employees.

      Fortunately, Dan Berger (Dan Berger) in the Social Tables has created a <a href="http://culture.socialtables.com/">culture</a> in which changes are welcome: Make mistakes quickly and often.  Every day - training.  High risk - high reward.  Constant innovation.  Our culture encourages and values ‚Äã‚Äãchange, which has given me no choice but ... to change myself. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h4>  Even so, so what? </h4><br>  I used to do everything ‚Äúright‚Äù once and move on without looking back.  I did everything right the first time, so why should I change something?  This is already done right!  Changes can only spoil everything!  Fortunately for me, in Social Tables every day is a learning one, and I quickly realized that every moment gives the opportunity to learn something new. <br><br>  Looking at each change, I ask myself: ‚ÄúWhat did it teach me?‚Äù Or ‚ÄúWhat can I change, knowing this or that fact?‚Äù.  And this became the basis of how I achieve results. <br><br><h4>  Fidbek is a gift. </h4><br>  And if making changes to your work is the first step, then the second is the ability to accept and evaluate the comments and comments of other people.  This is the biggest step. <br><br>  Remarks are often perceived as if someone is trying to reproach you in your wrong or to indicate that you do not know what you are doing.  Here, my stubbornness and resistance to the adoption of change took the most dangerous face. <br><br>  Criticism is something that I am obliged to appreciate, to love and what I should passionately desire.  When I realized that my attitude towards comments was the greatest obstacle to my personal and professional growth, I had to make efforts to combat my usual negative reaction to criticism, which took some time. <br><br>  Now, every time I get comments, the first thought that appears in my head is: ‚ÄúThank you.‚Äù  Be grateful to those people who are trying to help you become better.  This is a priceless prospect, and you are lucky that he or she is quite indifferent and helps you improve. <br><br><h4>  What brings you here will not lead you further. </h4><br>  And now what?  I am addicted to change.  If nothing changes, I find no place for myself.  If we do not constantly change our goals, strategies and tactics, then this means that we are not learning and not improving.  I know that when I start to feel calm, I need to change something. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/67f/917/056/67f9170567cd46f3b328d1985ea47889.jpg"><br><br>  <i>The schedule behind which there is a lot of scientific research.</i>  <i>It shows how your startup comfort level should change over time.</i> <br><br>  In a fast-growing company, flexibility and the ability to adapt to change are advantages over your competitors.  To achieve success in an environment focused on growth, you need to learn how to change with the growth of the company. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/294320/">https://habr.com/ru/post/294320/</a></p>
