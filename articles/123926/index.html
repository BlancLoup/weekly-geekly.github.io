  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Payoneer cards - not just for freelancers</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  We were extremely pleased to receive such a warm welcome at Habr√© last week.  After a lot of comments caused by our introductory article, we realized how actively Habr's audience uses Payoneer cards.  Most of them are freelance techies working on world freelance exchanges such as oDesk, Elance, GetAFreelancer and others, but we have quite a few other partner companies from other fields that make payments to their remote employees using our service.  We will tell about these additional industries today.  For a snack, we promise a little surprise. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  First, freelancing freelance strife.  In addition to the exchanges traditionally focused on programmers, designers, system administrators, etc., among our partners there are a number of photo stocks (iStockphoto, Dreamstime, Veer, etc.) paying fees to photographers.  We also work with companies that translate into foreign languages ‚Äã‚Äãand pay salaries for translators, outsourcing support services (FixYa) and others. <br><br>  Another category of our partners are e-commerce platforms and payment aggregators, which allow store owners to receive revenue on Payoneer cards.  Of course, we are talking about services that specialize in trading software products like Plimus, Avangate, PayPro and others.  In addition to them, among our partners you can find platforms such as 2CheckOut (2CO), TrialPay, FastSpring, Kagi, etc.  A number of payment aggregators prefer to issue our cards to their merchants, among them SMSCoin and Z-Payment known in the Russian market. <br><br>  In the following articles we will continue the story about our partners from various industries, and now the promised surprise. <br>  Some of you already know that we have launched a <a href="http://community.payoneer.com/">forum for Payoneer cardholders</a> .  At the forum, you can exchange thoughts, comments, find out news about the service, etc.  One of the latest news was the <a href="http://community.payoneer.com/topic/191-great-new-referral-prizes/">announcement of the creation of a referral program</a> that allows each cardholder to earn $ 100 by sending a new partner to us.  Because  Most cardholders work simultaneously with several companies and prefer to receive transfers from each of them to the Payoneer card, new partner companies often come to us on the recommendation of one of the cardholders.  Now we would like to reward those who recommend us in this way and transfer $ 100 to his card when a new partner orders 3 cards and transfers at least $ 2,500 to them.  To do this, you only need to send the details of the new partner to taliakl@payoneer.com (in Russian).  Details and conditions of the program <a href="http://community.payoneer.com/topic/191-great-new-referral-prizes/">here</a> .
