  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Blockchain in education</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  With the increasing popularization of Bitcoin, everyone has heard such words as ‚Äúblockchain‚Äù, ‚Äúcryptocurrency‚Äù, ‚Äúsmart contract‚Äù, etc. Everyone who feels comfortable is opening their own ICOs.  However, do not treat cryptocurrency and blockchain only as a way of earning and currency. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/hc/gh/s8/hcghs8vxqy8yfpsnkwywpopxbiq.jpeg" alt="image"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Today, the distributed blockchain database is increasingly integrated into the document storage and control systems.  The advantage of this technology is the lack of practical manipulation of data recorded in the system, due to the fact that the information in the database can only be added, but not overwritten.  At the same time, the truth of the document is easily traced, since everyone sees who he was recorded in the blockchain.  Along with the identity card and the banking sector, Crypto-Revolution did not bypass the education system. <br><br><h3>  Pioneers </h3><br>  2017 became the starting point for the cryptolization of education.  The first to officially use the blockchain to store their diplomas and certificates was the <a href="https://digitalcurrency.unic.ac.cy/">University of Nicosia</a> .  Importantly, it also became the first university that accepts Bitcoin as a payment for cryptocurrency.  Mass Open Online Courses (MOOC) of Nicosia University are available in 83 countries of the world.  He is also a member of the European Universities Association (EUA) and the European Association of Higher Education Institutions (EURASHE).  This means that his diplomas and certificates are recognized worldwide.

      Such organizations as ‚Äú <a href="http://kmi.open.ac.uk/technologies/name/blockchain">Open University (UK)</a> ‚Äù, <a href="https://www.sony.net/SonyInfo/News/Press/201708/17-071E/index.html">‚ÄúSony‚Äù</a> , <a href="http://blockchain.mit.edu/">‚ÄúMassachusetts Institute of Technology‚Äù</a> and others also picked up the baton. <br><br><h3>  Perspectives and standardization </h3><br>  Prospects for using the blockchain technology are not limited to a distributed database.  Its dynamism and transparency also has the potential to revolutionize the education system as a whole (through the development and legitimization of online education).  The popularity of Massive Open Online Courses (MOOC) is constantly growing, as they provide an opportunity to gain practical knowledge from anywhere in the world, and also have a lower tuition fee.  Based on the ability to combine individual courses into blocks of courses, it is possible to propose various learning strategies for narrowly focused specialties.  Also, the blockchain allows you to standardize certificates and diplomas of universities and online educational portals, which in the future will legalize them for all countries of the world. <br><br><h3>  Globalization </h3><br>  What development opportunities will we get if all educational organizations write their certificates in one global blockchain? <br><br>  Certificates and diplomas confirm the presence of certain skills and knowledge of the candidate.  Storing data in one system allows you to distribute them between companies, creating a system of dynamic personnel search for a set of specialist skills for specific enterprises.  In turn, this will create a demand for certain skills, which, in turn, sets the trend for certain courses in real time.  The candidate will see what exactly is required to study to obtain the desired position.  Educational organizations, adapting to the new trends in the labor market, will offer ‚Äúdynamic course blocks‚Äù, where the student chooses only what he needs for further professional growth. <br><br>  This vector of development of the education system also fundamentally solves the problem of the rapid deactivation of curricula, which was formed during the acceleration of the development of Information Technologies. <br><br><h3>  Forecast for the future </h3><br>  Every year, labor market trends are becoming more volatile.  The speed of technology development is growing exponentially, and with it the requirements for specialists in all spheres of labor.  The relevance of educational programs that offer classic educational systems sometimes decreases even at the beginning of the school year and requires adjustment.  The presence of dynamic monitoring of companies' requirements for candidates, as well as the growing popularity of Massive Open Online Courses and online education in general, will allow educational organizations to easily adjust to development trends in the field of education, as well as to improve relations without intermediaries between them (specific universities, educational organizations, students and enterprises, working as a single system thanks to the blockchain register. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/344764/">https://habr.com/ru/post/344764/</a></p>
