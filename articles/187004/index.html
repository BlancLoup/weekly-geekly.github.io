At the end, you will also find a selection of Build reports useful for a design audience (for developers, by the way, they are also useful). <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br><h2>  Interface overview </h2><br>  First of all, if you haven‚Äôt yet installed a preview version of Windows 8.1, you can do it from here: <a href="http://preview.windows.com/">preview.windows.com</a> .  On the eve of the Build conference, the Windows team prepared a video from Jensen Harris with an overview of the main changes:

If in Windows 8 there were three such modes: full, snapped and fill, and also portrait and landscape modes were clearly distinguished, then in Windows 8.1 these separations are erased.  Now the application can be almost any width, and the default minimum width is now 500 pixels, which is more than it was in Snapped mode.  However, the creators of the application can declare a smaller supported width (just up to the very 320px that were in Snapped mode). <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/ade/2a5/e28/ade2a5e28a20b534027206ac7fa5aefa.png"><br><br>  As a result, the same applications can now be located on the screen in very different proportions, depending on what is more important to the user now, and more than two applications can be seen at the same time. <br><br>  Another consequence is that now there is no difference between the portrait mode and, say, the ‚Äúmode‚Äù of displaying the application in landscape mode, but with the same side sizes (possibly on a different device). <br><br>  For the designer, of course, this is an additional difficulty, since you need to think through the screen adaptation strategy for different sizes and conditions, in much the same way as is done today for sites in the concept of Responsive Design. <br><br>  It also means that you need to pay special attention to how the application bars, headers, search bar, scrolling, pop-up items and dialogs, as well as the settings bars behave in different states. <br><br>  If you are going to keep the application width at 320px, then in this state the same recommendations as for Snapped mode remain applicable.  In particular, vertical scrolling, smaller indents, headers, back buttons, etc. <br><br>  <b>New sizes of tiles.</b>  In Windows 8.1, two new tile sizes have been added: small and large square.  All available formats can be supported in your application. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/847/d78/b7e/847d78b7e48b65b236d1c69f80ba3550.jpg"><br><br>  Small tiles: 70x70px.  Large tiles: 310x310px.  Also note that since now there are three different sizes of square tiles, instead of the name square, small, medium and large are now used. <br><br>  Notifications are not supported on small tiles, but badges (small icons) work.  The general recommendation for large and wide tiles: if you support them, make them live, not just static pictures. <br><br>  <b>Updates in search.</b>  In Windows 8.1, the general search engine has been significantly reworked, taking into account all the feedback we received since the release of Windows 8. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/3ac/98b/02f/3ac98b02febc75a813591db88f3be891.jpg"><br><br>  Although you can still integrate into the general search contract, I recommend now that the guidelines be implemented within the application, if this is an important feature for your scripts.  Especially for this, <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/ru-ru/library/windows/apps/dn301949.aspx">HTML</a> and <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/ru-ru/library/windows/apps/windows.ui.xaml.controls.searchbox.aspx">XAML</a> developed a new searchbox control, similar in API, to how you previously integrated with the search contract.  Control supports hints and suggestions for results. <br><br>  See also updated guide here: <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/apps/hh465233.aspx">msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/apps/hh465233.aspx</a> <br><br>  <b>Hub</b>  The long-sought-after control, which would allow to combine dissimilar elements into a single system with a common scrolling, has finally found implementation. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/eb9/cab/fbf/eb9cabfbf1d19c08e0689b13c96dd925.png"><br><br>  Now you have a special control for this - Hub ( <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/apps/dn255137.aspx">HTML</a> , <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/apps/windows.ui.xaml.controls.hub.aspx">XAML</a> ).  We will tell about a number of other new controls in separate articles, I‚Äôd just note that another important control, the WebView, also received a big update. <br><br>  <b>Integration with the system: people, events, alarm clock</b> .  Now, in addition to integration with contacts, you also have the opportunity to integrate with the user's calendar. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/d93/660/56a/d9366056ae1b3e10d0398760f7252699.png"><br><br>  Additionally, your application can act as an alarm clock. <br><br>  You can also read about some additional changes in the overview guide here: <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/ru-ru/library/windows/apps/bg182890.aspx">msdn.microsoft.com/ru-ru/library/windows/apps/bg182890.aspx</a> .  In particular, from it you can learn how to synthesize speech in Windows 8.1, if necessary in your application. <br><br>  Also in Windows 8.1 improved work with USB, Bluetooth-enabled devices.  Work with POS-devices (for example, barcode scanners), as well as 3d-printers is supported.
