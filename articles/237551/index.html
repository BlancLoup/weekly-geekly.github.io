I think, needless to say, where I am a friend sent the author of this call. <br><br>  Nevertheless, I am grateful to him, because  He made me think: why is it all crazy about the Ice Bucket Challenge?  Why is this charity campaign has gained worldwide popularity?  Every day on the planet starts a lot of charity events, and none of them has so far had such a frantic success.

      I found the answers to these questions. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  There are two reasons for the popularity of the Ice Bucket Challenge: one mercantile and not very significant, the other super mercantile and super essential.  About the first one it would be possible not to speak at all, since  it is more or less common to all charity events.  However, in the case of the Ice Bucket Challenge (IBC), it takes on a special meaning due to the second reason. <br><br>  Let's start with the less important.  With the atonement of sins ... <br><br>  How do I imagine the average IBC member?  This person almost never donates to charity and almost never pours cold water.  By sacrificing 10 bucks in connection with IBC, the participant redeems his ‚Äúegoism‚Äù, the awareness of which the participant periodically incurs.  Since  if a person has not been too cold with cold water before, then from his point of view, redemption turns out to be quite complete: he physically ‚Äúsuffers‚Äù for sins.  By the way, the ability to "suffer" physically allows you to not really suffer financially. <br><br>  The fact that the motive of ‚Äúredemption of sins‚Äù is really present is indicated by the comments of many IBC participants: ‚ÄúYou know, I constantly pour cold water and constantly donate money to charity, but &lt;portion of illogical delusions‚Äù.  Those.  people are aware of their mercantile motive and try to justify themselves in advance (if they tell a lie) or to isolate themselves from the mercantile motive (if they tell the truth). <br><br>  For those who told the truth, the moment of atonement is not particularly important.  However, they still remain slaves of the second motive, in comparison with which the first one generally fades away. <br><br>  The second motive is selfies.  It sounds trite, but very human.  This is not just a selfie, it is LEGAL SALFI.  You did not just buy a new swimsuit and sfotali yourself on the beach.  Your selfi (maybe all in the same swimsuit) you are struggling with the most dangerous disease! <br><br>  If it were not for this opportunity to make selfies, the Ice Bucket Challenge would not live even one day. <br><br>  Thanks to selfies, even the motive of repentance becomes more significant: you not only repent, but also publicly.  People are ready to give a lot for a quiet opportunity to publicly repent.  And here you are!  Ice Bucket Challenge. <br><br>  PS Not sure that my habrakarma survive this post.  But on the other hand, why should she tell me if I cannot say what I think about?  :) <br><habracut></habracut></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/237551/">https://habr.com/ru/post/237551/</a></p>
