Sergey, do you really want to be sent to ZATO? <br><br>  Sergey ponuro was silent. <br><br>  After the Big Free Revolution and the complete victory of the anti-pycrosists, ZATO ‚Äî closed abstract-creative societies appeared throughout the country.

Then they started for programmers.  Well-equipped barracks, two meals a day, mandatory sports activities that help keep fit ... <br><br>  Despite the predicted increase in productivity, the quality of works of art has declined, jeopardizing the interests of the main figure of any creative process - the CONSUMER.  After a lengthy debate in parliament, the government was forced to take extreme measures - a system of "motivating influences" was introduced.  If the created work didn‚Äôt gain likes, then the whole team cut the rations, and systematic sabotage of the creative development could lead to the transfer to the lumberjacks. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Sergey knew about CATF firsthand.  Many of his friends - interface designers, 3D modelers, texture makers have already been interchanged.  During the last census, he himself managed to impersonate a telecommunications engineer (the old connections in Baumanka and experience in the mobile operator helped).  But the circles were getting closer and closer, and Tatiana was worried for a reason. <br><br>  - No, you are.  - I just watched the show.  Am I a fool or something, working in broad daylight ... <br><br>  Tatyana did not say anything, but it was obvious in her eyes that she understood everything. <br><br>  - I can not go on.  Sorry, I ... - without contract, she turned around and ran out of the apartment. <br><br>  Sergey opened the lid of the laptop, launched the interpreter, but the thought did not go. <br><br>  He remembered how it all began: the jubilant crowd on the barricades, when in 2084 OASIS - ‚Äúthe united army for information freedom‚Äù won the election.  Free distribution, copying and modification of any works, the destruction of the moss copyright institute - all this sounded like a new era ... The era of freedom and prosperity.  And then it turned out that in 2084 only about a hundred films were shot.  OASIS responded instantly.  A 3% creativity tax was imposed, which all consumers were required to pay.  It was then that the first closed cities appeared.  While still voluntary, they looked like a panacea and guaranteed the efficiency of tax spending ... <br><br>  Who would have thought that would turn out like this ... <br><br>  On the stairs came the sound of boots, the door jerked open, letting people in black.  At the site, Sergei saw the tearful Tatyana. <br><br>  - Sorry ... You ... You, because you understand everything, right?  True? <br><br>  Sergey peered into the once beloved face and nodded. <br><br>  - Yes.  I understand. <br><br>  Denis Vitman.  Literary CUT No. 197. <br><br>  Ps.  Yes, I understand that the text is literary in nature and is ready to be punished into karma or translated into ridonly.  Hope not too strict. <br><br>  Pps.  Were renewed - please - <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/184036/">habrahabr.ru/post/184036</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/183506/">https://habr.com/ru/post/183506/</a></p>
