But with the growing number of web applications, cyber threats aimed at them have grown.  Companies began to pay more and more attention to information security. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Indeed, hacker attacks are becoming more ambitious, and therefore - bring more damage.  According to a report from research firm <a href="https://www.forrester.com/report/Lessons%2BLearned%2BFrom%2BThe%2BWorlds%2BMost%2BNotable%2BPrivacy%2BAbuses%2BAnd%2BSecurity%2BIncidents%2B2017/-/E-RES137315">Forrester</a> , three sectors are most vulnerable: government agencies, retail and technology. <br><br>  Companies operating in these areas are very attractive to fraudsters because they operate with a large amount of data about users' personal information.

      Large international initiatives are aimed at protecting personal data.  For all companies that work with European users, this is, for example, <a href="https://habr.com/company/digitalrightscenter/blog/344064/">GDPR</a> .  For violation of the rules established by the GDPR, significant fines were imposed, therefore companies are doubly interested in the high reliability of their clients' data protection in order to avoid costs. <br><br><h2>  The scale of information security threats </h2><br>  Some facts about the situation in the field of information security: <br><br><ul><li>  Hacker attacks happen every <a href="https://www.securitymagazine.com/articles/87787-hackers-attack-every-39-seconds">39 seconds</a> . </li><li>  DDoS attacks increased on average by <a href="https://www.nexusguard.com/threat-report-q2-2018">more than 500%</a> . </li></ul><br>  It is expected that cybersecurity by 2021 around the world will spend more than 1 trillion dollars a year.  The cost of cybercrime by this time will rise to 6 trillion per year! <br><br>  Probably, many people remember the large-scale distribution of Petya and WannaCry, which encrypted all the files on the computer and demanded a ransom with the threat of deleting the files.  Some experts came to the conclusion that the ultimate goal of these viruses was not so much a buyback, as a massive system failure, because as a result of the failure, the company suffers a lot more losses, which plays into the hands of competitors. <br><br>  The lack of uniform standards in web programming leads to the fact that software development has errors and vulnerabilities that a hacker will not fail to use for mercenary purposes.  And this, in turn, leads to company costs: leakage of confidential data, theft of intellectual property, delayed business processes and reputational losses. <br><br><h2>  WAF - protection of web applications from cybercriminals </h2><br>  However, with the action, the opposition also grows.  Approach to preventing attacks must be comprehensive - throughout the entire life cycle of the web application.  During development, special attention should be paid to testing and ethical hacking, which helps to identify and eliminate key vulnerabilities.  During operation, the application will be guarded by special protective equipment.  And here the installed antivirus and firewall will not save the application. <br><br>  Usually, a new generation firewall (NGFW - next generation firewall) for intrusion prevention and traffic filtering for applications (WAF - web application firewall) is the shield and sword of applications.  The difference between them is that NGFW controls the access of external applications to enterprise data, and WAF protects user applications on internal servers by analyzing data transmitted via the HTTP and HTTPS protocols.  It is WAF that can provide in-depth analysis of packet data content and take into account the features of the structure of web applications, which provides real-time protection and monitoring of applications, as well as has the functionality to block both known attacks and zero-day attacks. <br><br><h2>  Features of WAF technology </h2><br><ul><li>  Maximizes detection and detection rate for known and unknown threats; </li><li>  Minimizes false alerts (false positives) and adapts to constantly evolving web applications; </li><li>  Distinguishes automated traffic from real users and applies appropriate controls for both traffic categories; </li><li>  Provides deeper analysis and implementation due to ease of use and minimal impact on performance; </li><li>  Automates incident response workflow to help web application security analysts; </li><li>  It protects both mass open and internally used web applications and APIs. </li></ul><br><h2>  Compare 7 WAF leaders of the Gartner Magic Quadrant by characteristics </h2><br>  WAF solutions on the market a lot and for every taste.  To choose a product that will be ideally suited specifically for your company, you should pay attention to the functionality - different vendors have slightly different services.  Below is an overview of the market leaders of WAF software solutions, devices and cloud services, defined by the <a href="https://www.gartner.com/doc/reprints%3Fid%3D1-5ELTARA%26ct%3D180904%26st%3Dsb">Magic Quadrant for Web Application Firewall</a> in 2018.

A relatively expensive product, but developed by a company (Cambridge, 7500 people), whose development team deals exclusively with the security of web applications. <br><br>  Akamai provides a managed SOC that can track incidents.  The manufacturer applies automatic analytics and sorting of all the traffic that it processes, so that customers set up their signatures and collect threat information to create new means of protection. <br><br>  Since WAF Akamai is only available as a cloud service, for organizations that simply do not like cloud security solutions, or when evaluations of potential customers determine that compliance and regulatory restrictions restrict its use, Akamai will not work. <br><br>  <a href="https://www.akamai.com/us/en/resources/web-application-firewall.jsp">Akamai's Kona Web Application Firewall on the vendor's site</a> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/o4/jg/tz/o4jgtza4wlqz9a66xqvf-zlytp8.png"><br><br><h3>  Barracuda Web Application Firewall </h3><br>  Barracuda Web Application Firewall is a comprehensive system designed to ensure the security of web applications and sites for medium-sized businesses.  Barracuda WAF gives a powerful rebuff to attackers who exploit weaknesses in protocols and applications for data theft, service disruption, or website deface.  The WAF line is provided by a vendor for physical or virtual devices, and is also available on Microsoft Azure, AWS and Google Cloud Platform (GCP) platforms.  With the release of the WAF 1060, the Barracuda now supports bandwidths of up to 10 Gbps. <br><br>  Barracuda remains one of the best WAF in Microsoft Azure.  Barracuda Cloud WAF as a service includes protection against DDoS at no extra charge.  Technical support is appreciated by customers. <br><br>  The user interface is rated by users as user-friendly.  And here is good news for Russian speakers - the solution from Barracuda WAF has not only English, but also a Russian interface. <br><br>  The product from Barracuda is able to protect against the following attacks: SQL injection, cross-site scripting (XSS), session forgery and buffer overflow, and also prevents theft of information by monitoring all outgoing data for any secret information leaks (bank account numbers personal user information, passwords and other things). <br><br>  The system administrator will be able to detect DoS and DDoS attacks in time thanks to a special function that controls the data transfer rate.  Powerful built-in antivirus allows you to check any data and files imported into the system for various malicious code. <br><br>  Barracuda Web Application Firewall is fully compatible with most common authentication systems (Active Directory, eDirectory) that support LDAP RADIUS.  In addition, there is a two-factor identification function: the system supports user authenticators and tokens (RSASecureID) to ensure reliable protection of client authentication. <br><br>  <a href="https://www.barracuda.com/products/webapplicationfirewall">Barracuda Web Application Firewall on the vendor site</a> <br><br>  <a href="https://roi4cio.com/nc/produkty/produkt/forma-rascheta-ceny-produkta/%3Ftx_agiliwayroi_products%255Bproduct%255D%3D1309%26tx_agiliwayroi_products%255Baction%255D%3Dcalculate%26tx_agiliwayroi_products%255Bcontroller%255D%3DProducts">Barracuda Web Application Firewall Cost Calculator on ROI4CIO</a> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/_0/2h/1-/_02h1--npkx2b7feckovdekapgg.png"><br><br><h3>  Cloudflare WAF </h3><br>  Cloudflare web application firewall (WAF) in the cloud protects web applications from common vulnerabilities, such as SQL injection attacks, cross-site scripting and cross-site counterfeiting, without changes to the existing infrastructure.  Relatively inexpensive maintenance plans are convenient for small companies.  There are more expensive individual plans for large companies - Enterprise.  The self-service model used by the company allows customers to quickly and easily customize configurations using wizards.  Therefore, customers appreciate the ease of maintenance. <br><br>  Cloudflare (San Francisco, 700 employees) develops DDoS protection and CDN offers.  Cloudflare is a provider with a bandwidth of 15 Tbps and 152 data centers around the world.  This infrastructure not only supports high performance applications, but also provides the most advanced protection. <br><br>  The recent addition of Cloudflare Workers allows customers to host web applications in Cloudflare infrastructure, which should be attractive for small organizations.  The provider also provides an easily accessible ‚ÄúI'm under attack‚Äù button.  It automatically includes a set of protection and is convenient for emergency response. <br><br>  Cloudflare offers WAF only as a cloud service.  For organizations with restrictions on cloud services and organizations that require local physical or virtual devices, the product is not suitable. <br><br>  <a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/waf/">Cloudflare WAF on the vendor site</a> <a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/waf/"><br></a> <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/zr/lj/6_/zrlj6_r0deszrqi1sklgropx4oa.png"><br><br><h3>  Citrix NetScaler Application Firewall </h3><br>  Citrix NetScaler AppFirewall is a good choice for Citrix customers who value high-performance WAF devices.  NetScaler Web App Firewall is designed for the state segment, large and medium businesses due to the ability of NetScaler to scale applications for large organizations.

SecureSphere can be supplied both physical and virtual devices.  It is also available as a cloud service and a cloud service - WAF Incapsula on AWS and Microsoft Azure.  Imperva (Redwood Shores, California) also offers managed rulesets for AWS WAF. <br><br>  The maximum supported bandwidth of the older model reaches 10 Gb / s.  In addition to HTTP / HTTPS, there is support for WebSockets, XMS and JSON web standards.  The products are interesting by the simultaneous application of several cyber defense technologies at once: control of protocols for abnormal behavior, dynamic profiling, analysis through signatures, and session tracking.  For all Imperva products, quality support is provided, rated by customers. <br><br>  The imperva web application firewall consists of two main modules: <br>  SecureSphere Web Application Firewall - protection of web applications from cyber attacks; <br>  ThreatRadar is a reputation database (ThreatRadar allows you to quickly block traffic coming from suspicious sources, even before the impact of any harmful effects). <br><br>  Imperva offers flexible licensing for organizations using both local and cloud applications.  This allows the manufacturer to focus on a wider range of use cases and organizations, as well as better manage the transition from the WAF device to the WAF cloud service. <br><br>  SecureSphere clients report that the management console remains difficult to use more advanced features, and professional services are often required for deployment to be deployed. <br><br>  For effective protection, mechanisms are applied based on the signatures of the free open-source Snort intrusion prevention system, as well as its own SQL signatures generated by the ADC (Application Defense Center) research center.  In terms of fault tolerance, there is support for clustering Active-Active and Active-Passive. <br><br>  SecureSphere WAF is equipped with a non-embeddable sniffer, transparent proxy server and reverse proxy server, it has excellent support for SSL.  So the product provides passive decryption of SSL, support for sessions established on client certificates, termination and determination (that is, SSL traffic analysis without termination).  It is important that the development contains hardware modules that accelerate SSL processing. <br><br>  Here, the method of classifying rules and applying detailed signatures (using firewall rules, creating signatures and processing protocol violations) is applied here to form a reference security model.  To adapt WAF to a variable application, the ability to change the profile of web applications created in machine learning mode is implemented.  However, there is a manual configuration of the web application profile. <br><br>  Implemented in SecureSphere WAF report generator, provides system administrators with reports in accordance with the requirements of information security standards.  There is also an opportunity to generate your own customized reports (including, according to the schedule) and export to various formats. <br><br>  <a href="https://www.imperva.com/resources/resource-library/datasheets/securesphere-web-application-firewall/">Imperva SecureSphere Web Application Firewall on the vendor site</a> <a href="https://www.imperva.com/resources/resource-library/datasheets/securesphere-web-application-firewall/"><br></a> <br>  <a href="https://roi4cio.com/produkty/produkt/forma-rascheta-ceny-produkta/%3Ftx_agiliwayroi_products%255Bproduct%255D%3D154%26tx_agiliwayroi_products%255Baction%255D%3Dcalculate%26tx_agiliwayroi_products%255Bcontroller%255D%3DProducts%26cHash%3D4483ef627610ae5ec195878536eb0e3a">Imperva SecureSphere Web Application Firewall Cost Calculator on ROI4CIO</a> <a href="https://roi4cio.com/produkty/produkt/forma-rascheta-ceny-produkta/%3Ftx_agiliwayroi_products%255Bproduct%255D%3D154%26tx_agiliwayroi_products%255Baction%255D%3Dcalculate%26tx_agiliwayroi_products%255Bcontroller%255D%3DProducts%26cHash%3D4483ef627610ae5ec195878536eb0e3a"><br></a> <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/zh/9y/4d/zh9y4do3myoahgbrayb5uxwcbtc.png"><br><br><h2>  findings </h2><br>  There is an opinion that in the future the cybercrime statistics will exceed the statistics of off-network crimes.  And now we should not neglect the protection against attacks, these investments pay off completely.
