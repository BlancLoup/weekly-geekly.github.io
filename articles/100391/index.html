  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Results of the first half of 2010</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Today, the situation on the Russian market of payment systems is quite optimistic, which is not surprising: more and more users trust electronic money, assessing their convenience and security and versatility. <br><br>  Payment systems offer users new and new opportunities to increase the liquidity of electronic money.  For reference: the total turnover of payments using electronic money in 2008, compared with 2007, grew by 36%, reaching 536 billion rubles.  Last year, this figure continued to grow: the total number of electronic money users amounted to about 20 million people. <br><br><h5>  Forecasts 2010 </h5><br>  Forecasts for 2010 can not but rejoice: the volume of the electronic money market will increase by 2 times compared with last year.  So says Victor Dostov, Chairman of the Board of the Electronic Money Association (AED).  However, with the proviso that the more realistic situation is a 50% increase in market volume. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  As for the QIWI Wallet, its financial turnover in the first half of 2010 amounted to more than 10.4 billion rubles compared to 11.7 billion <b>for the entire</b> last year.

      This situation allowed the EDA to conclude: e-money is really winning the mass consumer: the number of goods and services that can be paid for with e-money is constantly increasing.  In 2010, QIWI Wallet users paid for more than 2,000 goods and services, including making payments to 110 banks. <br><br>  A powerful engine of development of this market is electronic tickets and banking services.  It was these (and some other) categories that showed the highest growth rates in QIWI Wallet: tickets (366%), loan repayment (247%), online shopping (216%) and utility services (160%).  The share of banking services (loan repayment, account replenishment, money transfer) approached 50%. <br><br><h5>  QIWI Wallet: what's new </h5><br>  Along with other electronic money QIWI Wallet is constantly improving service, offering its users more and more new products and features. <br>  What new QIWI Wallet offered to its users this year?  First, the number of suppliers of goods and services has doubled.  Russian Railways, GE Money Bank, Dagestan Airlines, Yandex (Direct, Market, Catalog, Seminars), over 400 online stores and services, including InstaForex, Sape.ru, Davs.ru, have joined. <br><br>  QIWI Wallet provided users with the opportunity to pay traffic fines, and in cooperation with Unistream, offered money transfer services to 36 cities of Russia and 7 CIS countries.  What is nice: users can now transfer money between their wallets.  In addition, the QIWI Visa Virtual virtual card has become rechargeable. <br><br>  But that's not all.  In the first half of 2010, QIWI Wallet introduced an application for the iPhone, as well as the ability to pay for goods and services from the balance of Beeline and MegaFon.  And the users of the largest Russian social network VKontakte were able to pay for goods and services of all QIWI Wallet providers right from their page. <br><br>  <i>The second half of the year will be no less hot (not to be confused with the terrible heat that stands in Moscow).</i>  <i>We will offer all new and new services and actively develop.</i>  <i>Will it work out?</i>  <i>This will show the results of the second half of 2010.</i> <br><br>  Thank. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/100391/">https://habr.com/ru/post/100391/</a></p>
