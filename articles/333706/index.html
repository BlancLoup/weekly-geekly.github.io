      As a sign of respect for Ada Lovelace in this post, we want to tell about those in <a href="http://lanit.ru/">LANIT</a> who chose her path for themselves, despite the fact that in Russia IT still has a male face. <br><br>  Bonus - for all those who reproach our blog <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/company/lanit/blog/328972/">in the absence of bearded engineers</a> - let‚Äôs introduce the senior developer Anton.  Suppose that today he will be in the ‚Äúraspberries‚Äù and share his view on the project teams in which women work. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h2>  Charming developers LANIT </h2><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/7d8/51b/fc4/7d851bfc451347f990d1d9b79da3b57a.jpg"><br><br>  <b>Marina</b> : <br><br>  ‚ÄúAt LANIT, I have been designing an electronic document management system.  Most often I write in T-SQL. <br><br>  The programmer is a creative profession.  Constantly you learn something new, you communicate with clever and interesting people.  Inquisitiveness led me to the profession. <br><br>  People are often surprised to know who I work.  Apparently, in the minds of many a programmer should look a little different. <br><br>  During my work at LANIT, I managed to participate in various projects related to the organization of information storage and electronic document management.  It's nice to be aware of your contribution and see the results of the work. ‚Äù <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/744/b68/a8d/744b68a8d43f4bd79bc752737b971e69.jpg"><br><br>  <b>Alina:</b> <br><br>  ‚ÄúI am currently working on the Pega platform, which uses the Java programming language.  I also have experience in C ++. <br><br>  I decided to become a programmer because I liked the name of the faculty - the faculty of cybernetics.  Joke :) But seriously, computer science and mathematics were liked from school, and they were easy.  Therefore, choosing whom to be, did not hesitate at all.  An additional plus is the demand for the profession. <br><br>  Sometimes it seems to me that development is an opportunity to preserve the feeling of a student for many years.  In new projects there is always something to learn.  For example, I was very curious to work on a solution for recognizing the level of emotionality of a text in social networks.  Now I am creating applications for financial institutions. ‚Äù <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/dd5/e26/185/dd5e26185bf84edca02eb668a2a116ad.jpg"><br><br>  <b>Sophia</b> : <br><br>  ‚ÄúMy languages ‚Äã‚Äãare C ++ and Java.  In LANIT, I specialize in solutions for the largest banks in Russia: I develop various functions for credit processes, integrate solutions with third-party systems of financial institutions. <br><br>  From my own experience of working in a team, I can say that female developers are distinguished from guys by scrupulous accuracy in trifles and a sense of beauty in designing a user interface. ‚Äù <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/da0/a4f/c75/da0a4fc759f2486ea1086dc493a3d29c.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/547/512/6f5/5475126f505145008e695cb1441eeb88.jpg"><br><br>  <b>Alfia:</b> <br><br>  ‚ÄúIn LANIT, I participate in projects related to databases.  Perfectly ‚Äúspeak‚Äù in PL / SQL, creating database objects, query forms and functions.  I myself have chosen a profession for a long time.  Habitual doctors, lawyers, accountants, etc.  seemed boring.  The book ‚ÄúSQL for Dummies‚Äù, which accidentally caught my eye, helped in choosing.  After her, I understood what I would like to do.  It seems to me that women feel harmoniously in the IT sphere: they are less irritated by the routine work and more attentive. ‚Äù <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/544/b53/8bf/544b538bfa864b30a507e110a4b6126f.jpg"><br><br>  <b>Madinah:</b> <br><br>  ‚ÄúI specialize in Java and C ++.  In LANIT, I work on solutions for automating processes in the legal services of banks and judicial institutions, and during off hours, with a curiosity colleague, we can sit down to create production systems with threefold logic or a garbage collector for the C ++ language. <br><br>  At the university, the head of the department sometimes joked that female programmers did not exist, but this only reinforced the desire to create something to be proud of. ‚Äù <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/f56/997/fcc/f56997fccfaa4b4b8da2b0501803e308.jpg"><br><br>  <b>Galina:</b> <br><br>  ‚ÄúAt LANIT, I work with Pega, a platform for developing enterprise applications.  Prior to that, she wrote in C ++, which she studied independently since high school, and C #, whom she met during her student years.  It later wrote a program to test students' knowledge in the field of object-oriented programming.  The projects in which I participate are related to simplifying and automating the business processes of banking systems. <br><br>  I am often asked what stereotypes I come across in my work.  I don‚Äôt remember to come across them, the only exception is the question itself. ‚Äù <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/d65/493/317/d65493317dbd4c5a9cf82e9da509b75d.jpg"><br><br>  <b>Natalia:</b> <br><br>  ‚ÄúI ran into databases immediately after graduation.  For several years I worked in a telecommunications company.  Our department supported billing systems.  The work was dynamic, as customers needed a solution to quickly and efficiently process the services they consumed.  We are constantly modifying the systems that operators used. <br>  In future projects, the database did not leave me.  Last time I work with Oracle and PostgreSQL, and I started with MS SQL and VBA.  I am engaged in support and development of analysis and decision-making systems. <br><br>  It seems to me that a good team is definitely necessary for professional growth: by working with knowledgeable people, you can learn from them and quickly build up skills.  While I am lucky with the team. " <br><br><h2>  Promised Bonus </h2><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/4dc/d9d/671/4dcd9d6711584cfcb22d76cfe3b80aa7.jpg"><br><br>  <b>Anton, Senior Developer:</b> <br><br>  ‚ÄúIt seems to me that in the field of IT it is much easier to deal with women: they have more patience and understanding, they know how to build relationships, they feel the situation more thinly.  That is why the number of women invited to IT projects is increasing.  They work as technical writers, test engineers, business and systems analysts, consultants in the implementation of a variety of systems, and specialists in user support. <br><br>  At the same time, qualified female programmers are still rare.  It seems to me that in the development teams there are no more than 5% of them.  In some positions I have never met women.  For example, service engineers. <br><br>  It is especially pleasant that among the developers in LANIT there are girls. ‚Äù <br><br><hr>  <i>By the way, we now have several interesting vacancies open:</i> <i><br></i> <ul><li>  <a href="https://moikrug.ru/vacancies/1000035014">JAVA developer</a> </li><li>  <a href="https://moikrug.ru/vacancies/1000035026">PEGA Senior Developer</a> </li><li>  <a href="https://moikrug.ru/vacancies/1000035024">BPM Senior Analyst</a> </li></ul><br>  We are waiting for your resume! <br><hr></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/333706/">https://habr.com/ru/post/333706/</a></p>
