Today it is a working solution. <br><br>  Ten years ago, the automatic scheduling system was a wonder.  And today, banks are saving just on installing such a system and a lot of money on the fact that they are encouraging the best operators not with bonuses, but with convenient schedules.

      Three years ago, few people considered paper calls (loan applications, for example), letters, regular calls, messages on Twitter and posts on Facebook as identical entities that simply come to the operator‚Äôs workplace to respond. <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  Basic call center starts from about 10 jobs.  At first, everything is done intuitively, and without special software.  Then, up to 50 operators need automation only in a number of bottlenecks, everything else is solved, again, by the head or senior shift.  That's when the number of operators passes for 50, it becomes more interesting.  We need software or even several software solutions that fully cover the contact center infrastructure and solve many problems. <br><br><h4>  Situations </h4><br>  <b>There is no call center yet.</b>  For example, the Russian representative office of the western company opens.  From my practice, as a rule, this is either a new customer, or a customer to whom we have already deployed a data center, switched, he already has corporate telephony, postal services.  The customer needs a single point of service for customer requests.  The situation is relatively simple, because building from scratch is more often easier than refactoring. <br><br>  <b>There is KC, it needs to be expanded or problems solved.</b>  Often, you need to upgrade the auto-information functionality, give supervisors more control functions, set up a shift distribution system on a schedule, compare indicators of different operators.  Operators need to quickly identify the client, see its call history, forward the identified client further along the chain. <br><br><h4>  Automatic telephone station </h4><br>  Before turning to solutions, I want to note that all the components discussed can be virtualized, that is, solutions are software that is easily installed on the customer‚Äôs server. <br><br>  The Automatic Telephone Station component is the core of the call center.  This is the basic functionality of call distribution, familiar to you from Asterisk class systems.  Depending on the business requirements change.  For example, banks require several levels of fault tolerance, i.e. N systems (usually 3-5) should fail to make a telephone connection fail.  Scalability is important - there is no need to change the solution architecture when expanding a business, you do not need to throw away old modules. <br><br>  A call center is an add-on to a PBX and implies a change in the operation of the PBX logic under the logic of the CC, namely: the notion of a group of operators or operator skill emerges - the union of operators into a logical group to which the call is distributed;  a telephone set that serves as a means of receiving and making calls is assigned the role of an ‚Äúoperator‚Äù, an entity behind which there is a living employee, by which you can watch statistics, assign groups or skills.  For business, this means that all the basic functionality is added, which allows you to turn a group of employees with corporate phones into a full-fledged CC or call center. <br><br><h4>  1. Multichannel and AWP </h4><br>  Today the question that a person addresses, and not the channel of circulation, comes to the first place.  The client no longer cares how he will receive an answer to his request, he can write to Facebook, send mail, sms and so on.  All of these instances come in a single operator interface.  For example, he can hang up after the call, and then not pick up the phone again, but answer the SMS in his program, then the client will send him a tweet with a question and so on.  Staying in one application, without leaving the working screen, the operator answers all calls.  Such systems are used in large retail, banks, operators, insurance around the world.  You can try to tweet about the problem of your mobile operator - the whole ‚ÄúGrossen triplen‚Äù is constantly monitored.  One of the shift operators will try to help you. <br><br>  Everything is done automatically, including the registration of the reasons for the calls, work with all types of calls (phone call, web chat, email), receiving messages in the form of a scrolling text.  The screenshot below shows the operator‚Äôs automated workplace, which processes the incoming call - the client‚Äôs card automatically opens, the phone number from which the call was received, for further work the employee goes to the caller‚Äôs personal account, where all information on operations is displayed. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/315/5e3/2ef/3155e32effe74fa689ab48caa3fb6833.jpg"><br>  Call card <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/29c/498/d1f/29c498d1f0d545ddaeb215ca02cef2df.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/023/01f/c47/02301fc4760b4c46ac5dbb4a0d5f43cf.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/569/a73/c5d/569a73c5d83d4125884f38a8fa12a500.png"><br>  SMS sending example <br><br><h4>  2. Workforce Management </h4><br>  WFM solutions are used to create a work schedule.  Up to 50 people, everything is done in Excel, but for a hundred people, even a few compilers cannot cope.  More precisely, how - cope, but far from the most optimal way.  By law, the work schedule must be prepared and provided to employees in advance. <br><br>  Systems of this class allow you to set a number of rules, take into account the level of qualification, additional skills, for example, proficiency in foreign languages, vacations, including study, as well as specific details, in particular, an individual schedule, and create a schedule automatically.  You can make predictions - how many operators will be needed if the organization gives advertising, and the flow of requests will increase by 20-30%.  WFM is applicable not only for operators who handle phone calls, but also for those who work with any kind of customer calls: through the website, email, mobile application, coming to the office personally and submitting a paper credit application. <br><br><h4>  3. Outbound call system </h4><br>  Imagine that you need to ring around 50 customers who left their orders in the online store at night.  It is possible to dial in numbers and occupy the operator in turn, but this is not very rational.  If the call center is large, it is enough to make sure that you have at least one free operator in reserve (that is, do not give him calls yet) and start the call. <br><br>  Suppose, according to statistics, only 7 out of 10 subscribers answer.  The three remaining at this time go to the subway, replenish the balance or speak with someone.  So, roughly speaking, we need 7 operators for 10 running calls.  Further, one operator fulfills 10 calls in 30 minutes.  Of these, about 4 minutes, he listens to beeps.  This means that if you throw out the wait, you can put 10 calls in 26 minutes.  There are companies for which hit rate is only 20% (2 out of 10 calls), and in such cases the prediction system becomes very useful. <br><br>  Outgoing dialing systems take these calculations into account and start connections as the operator is released.  The result of the system is a finished call, where the operator enters upon the connection.  That is, minus the beeps and minus dial-up - optimization. <br><br>  We implemented such a system in OTP Bank - it was possible to significantly accelerate the morning round of those who have delayed the loan payment, for example.  Plus, the same system makes repeated calls during the day, until it gets through (also automatically).  She increased the productivity of employees by increasing the number of calls to clients 2.5-3 times during the day. <br><br><h4>  4. Synthesis of speech </h4><br>  Used for automatic interactive answering machines (IVR).  The most common task of synthesis is to tell the caller a certain number: the balance of the cell phone, the balance on the bank account, the amount of the next loan payment.  It also tells you the office hours, the nearest ATM, the time for obtaining a visa and much more.  In general, IVR can access the database, retrieve information from there according to certain rules and read it to the client. <br><br>  Speech synthesis is also used for outgoing calls.  For example, in retail, when ordering through online stores, the robot sometimes calls back and reads the date and time of delivery, and then asks to press 1 if everything is correct.  You know his brother-robot when you call support - he often asks to evaluate the work of the operator. <br><br>  In general, robots have become damn chatty lately. <br><br>  In my practice, several very interesting problems were solved using a dynamic IVR.  One large telecom company has organized unique special offers (service packages, discounts, gift bonuses for loyal customers, etc.).  There are a lot of offers, and there are a lot of different scenarios, to whom which proposal needs to be issued, ten times more.  Due to the correct order of services in the voice menu, the statistics for connecting additional services showed that everything was done as it should. <br><br>  Or an example from the financial industry: a classic task.  There are various customer segments (most often they are divided by profitability for the organization and activity in financial transactions) which have completely different needs for the necessary information.  In one voice menu, all the needs simply do not fit, if not to consider non-ergonomic monsters.  Dynamic IVRs allow you to rely on business processes and business needs, which is often convenient for customers in the end. <br><br><h4>  5. Voice recognition </h4><br>  From the voice of a person you can make an imprint on the characteristic distortions of sound, due to the structure of the pharynx, nose and just individual features.  When calling in similar conditions (from the same phone with no wind noise or an excavator in the background), the recognition accuracy of a 6-second passage is about 90-95%, depending on voice. <br><br>  This means several things at once: <br><ol><li>  For authentication is not enough, but as a factor in confirming trust, it completely passes.  For example, when you ask for the balance of the phone, the operator no longer needs to make a long identification on the passport.  You are calling from the same number, the line parameters are similar, the voice coincided by 90%.  You can give non-critical information without inconvenience to you. </li><li>  When you try to fake your voice, an attacker will most likely be able to quietly copy the features of intonation and timbre, but not the physical characteristics of speech.  In this regard, recognition works very precisely - while the parodists could not deceive the system. </li><li>  You can conduct a reverse search by comparing your voice with other voices of the base.  In fact, this means that in the background any call to the call center of the bank is immediately compared with the voices of famous froders. </li><li>  You can try to find your call from another number among all the conversations.  Given the accuracy, you will have to listen to more than a dozen records, but with long sections of speech - these will be hundreds, not tens of thousands of options. </li></ol><br><br>  More information for paranoids is here <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/croc/blog/184980/">about voice prints</a> . <br><br><h4>  6. Speech analytics </h4><br>  The robot is able to make out words (not everything and not always, but often) and brazenly uses it.  For example, in computing capacity, tasks of searching for downtime in banking processes often revolve.  The call center loads 40-50 thousand calls, the robot searches for pauses, recognizes everything that was before and after them, builds its opinion about what this process was.  And at the output he says: friends, when a client on Monday morning asks if he can take a loan as a pledge of tare, the operator thinks too long.  Or there is something like the fact that an insurance client in a rare case (professional athlete, going to an unpopular country, you need a very interesting insurance) can wait a couple of minutes until the operator finds in the interface how to do it.  Also looking for interface brakes. <br><br>  Of course, word recognition helps us to understand which operator incorrectly greets, who uses parasitic words, who uses the client, and so on.  And also - what the client thinks about the call: all sorts of "no, thank you" after offering something, negative-positive feedback and much more.  Details for paranoid here: <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/croc/blog/235565/">habrahabr.ru/company/croc/blog/235565</a> <br><br>  <b>Plus there is an analyst of the emotional state.</b>  While not a very accurate system, but still useful.  For example, now many large Russian banks are testing similar solutions.  For the first time in Russia, speech analytics systems were implemented in the National Recovery Service, which serves 83 regions of Russia.  If a long pause occurs during a dialogue, people start interrupting each other or switch to obscene language, this will certainly become known to the supervisor. <br><br><h4>  7. Recording system </h4><br>  Problem: there was a conflict between the operator and the client.  The client is right, but the operator expresses his position to the supervisor, using the knowledge of the specifics of the work.  And convinces him of being right.  In the absence of a real version, the supervisor believes the operator, as a result, the offended, but right-handed, customer with losses refuses services, and the operator continues to successfully use the experience gained with new customers.  Writing solves the problem. <br><br>  The second problem.  The operator is right, but the client pretends that the CC operators did not provide any information to him, sues the customer, wins the case, the customer incurs losses. <br><br>  The third situation.  Operator training.  I called a particularly annoying client, he was answered by a mega-polite girl, arranged a ‚Äúphone sex‚Äù session, with the result that the client was satisfied and even bought something.  The call was saved as a reference and was used to train three generations of operators. <br><br>  Also, to monitor not only conversations, but also operator actions, a screen recording system is used. <br><br><h4>  8. Customer Feedback </h4><br>  Call evaluation menu Customer Feedback allows you to evaluate the work of operators, CC and ask other questions to the client after his conversation with the operator.  After that, the supervisor can easily upload sets of evaluations by operators, specific issues at any time. <br><br><h4>  9. CRM Integration and Reporting </h4><br>  In banks, customer data is stored in one or several ABS (automated banking system), most often CRM is used for this purpose.  When a call is received in CC, the operator‚Äôs card from CRM opens on the operator‚Äôs screen.  The operator sees the information that you may need - recent card transactions, current balance, products that can be offered due to the fact that the client has taken out a loan.  In online stores you can see past products, plus recommendations on related purchases.  Age and birthdays of children, if it is, for example, a toy store.  Operating system and IT-literacy, if this is the support of the provider.  Data consolidation saves time and increases efficiency.  Here are examples: <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/croc/blog/140490/">habrahabr.ru/company/croc/blog/140490</a> <br><br>  The most difficult thing is, of course, to caste-place the regular capabilities of CRM and CC-solutions for current business processes.  Therefore, we need integrators who modify the file very, very much. <br><br>  In parallel, as a rule, the analyst is done.  It can be implemented both within the call-center, and separately, at the level of all BI-systems of the customer.  This unified system means that there is no need to manually collect and process technological data from various subsystems (call management, recording systems, personnel records, or operator workstations). <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/0c6/a9f/6bd/0c6a9f6bdb3242949872e1744078a513.png"><br>  <i>Avaya and Siebel CRM integration module</i> <br><br><h4>  10. Monitoring </h4><br>  There will be problems with hardware and software.  When reserving all the components of the KC, with increased and geolocation fault tolerance, in the absence of maintenance work and bona fide technical support staff of the customer, sooner or later there will be a situation when the components of a subsystem of the KC fail.  Then, if CC is designed correctly, and fault tolerance is given due attention, CC work will continue due to switching to backup components, but such work is no longer normal, and if the situation worsens, a refusal to provide the service may occur.  The reason, which leads to serious irregularities, may be some kind of ‚Äúinsignificant‚Äù trifle, which is not paid attention to for a long time, and then the result is extremely sad.  In order not to miss such a trifle, react in time, eliminate the drawback and prevent major problems, use monitoring systems.  Such systems analyze a huge number of parameters of the KC subsystems, react sensitively to their changes and promptly inform the technical services staff through various available channels so that the Armageddian does not happen unexpectedly.  Messages from the monitoring system can be automatically registered in the accounting systems of the customer, sent out according to a certain scheme to employees, management, operating organization.  Most often, e-mail is used for informing, but other channels can be used, for example, SMS or voice message by phone. <br><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Call examples</b> <div class="spoiler_text">  Below is part of the logs of our tests on the banks, where we called on behalf of a new client.  You can see some of the functionality and simply offhand compare the work of operators. <br><br>  - *** Bank, Victoria, hello! <br>  - Victoria, good afternoon!  I would like to rent a bank box in your bank.  Tell me, please, is it possible, do you provide such a service? <br>  <b>// at this moment there was enough data to compare the voice with the froder base</b> <br>  - Yes, of course, tell me, please, how can I contact you? <br>  - My name is Galina. <br>  <b>// operator sees the city by phone number</b> <br>  - Galina, very nice.  From Moscow call? <br>  - Yes. <br>  <b>// most likely, clicks on the ‚ÄúCell‚Äù item in the AWP, the script offers to set dimensions</b> <br>  - Galina, tell me, please, the size of the cell, you know which ones you need? <br>  - Yes, I need a cell height of at least 30 centimeters, a width of 15-20 centimeters, well, and a depth, well, centimeters 10. <br>  - I understand you.  Please stay on the line, I'll clarify. <br>  Further - 4 minutes were held on hold, and then the call was dropped.  At the second call, another authorization was required, they did not do a bundle with the previous one, although, theoretically, it is quite simple.  They advised to call immediately to the office of a particular bank branch, and not into the general CC - this process is clearly not integrated, the verification is in the hands or in another system. <br><br>  <b>***</b> <br>  - My name is Galina. <br>  - Galina.  What city are you in? <br>  <b>// KC does not determine the city by phone</b> <br>  - In Moscow. <br>  - Yeah. <br>  - Please wait to clarify this information. <br>  - Yes, well, thank you. <br>  (expectation) <br>  - Thanks for the long wait.  Galina, please specify in which office would you be comfortable renting a safe deposit box? <br>  - Well, you know, I somewhere in the north of Moscow, the area there Otradnoe, Altufyevo, Vladykino, in general, the gray branch. <br>  - Wait, please.  I will clarify this information. <br>  - Thank. <br>  (expectation) <br>  - Thanks for the long wait.  Galina, here we have safe cells for *** additional power and additional ‚Äú***‚Äù power - these are the closest ones to you. <br>  <b>// two delays in the process, obviously it took either something to search for a long time, or the operator simply called these departments.</b> <br><br>  <b>***</b> <br>  - What city are you coming from? <br>  - Moscow. <br>  ... <br>  - Thank you very much for the wait.  That is, there are only three compartments for individual use, but currently there are only safe compartments in 2 compartments - this is either the *** metro station or the *** metro station. <br>  - Yeah.  That is, it is not before Wednesday that I can, yes, do it? <br>  - Yes, quite right.  Yes, it is in these offices.  Let's clarify with you what height you need? <br>  - 30 centimeters. <br>  - 30 centimeters? <br>  - 30, yes.  Yep <br>  - Well, at the current moment, that is, only you can then turn right here to the ‚ÄúRiver Station‚Äù.  That is, there are 4 safe boxes, height is 46 centimeters, the width and depth are 30 and 40, respectively. <br>  <b>// obviously there is good integration with CRM</b> <br><br>  <b>***</b> <br>  - Yeah.  Yes, we are provided in some branches of the bank safe deposit boxes for the transaction, but today banks do not work. <br>  - Yeah.  Neither today nor tomorrow? <br>  - Yes, day off until November 5th. <br>  - Yeah.  Well, if November 5th ... Where can I make, rent? <br>  - Call us at the contact center of the bank, we will transfer your call to the necessary department.  We will clarify whether there is a cell that interests you and a number. <br>  - So today I can not do it?  I just need to‚Ä¶ <br>  - Today, banks do not work. <br><br>  <b>***</b> <br>  - Banking group "***", my name is Svetlana.  Hello. <br>  - Svetlana, good afternoon.  Tell me, please, I would like to rent a bank box.  Can I do this in your bank? <br>  - Yes, of course, a minute, please wait. <br>  - Thank. <br>  (expectation). <br>  - Hello. <br>  - I'm listening to you. <br>  - Hello.  But I was transferred to you.  I would like to rent a bank box in your bank.  I can do it? <br>  - Wait a second. <br>  - Good afternoon, Nadezhda is listening. <br>  - Hope, good afternoon.  I have been switched for the third time.  I would like to ask about the possibility of renting a bank cell.  Can I do this in your bank? <br>  - And you know, you are now communicating with the main office.  We are on *** side street, this is ***, we do not have free cells now, unfortunately. <br>  - Oh, that is, I was immediately connected to you.  Ok, I get it.  And when they are released, there is no such information either, right? <br>  - No, there is no such information.  No one will say this when something can happen.  But, if time suffers, then call, be interested.  We still have *** ext.  office, this *** metro.  If you are satisfied geographically, you can call there, ask. <br><br>  <b>***</b> <br>  - And, that is, today you cannot consult me ‚Äã‚Äãat all?  Tariffs there, what documents.  Do you have such information? <br>  - It is necessary to contact the bank branch, to clarify the information.  Correctly.  To do this, you will need to contact the 5th. <br>  - Ok, I understand you.  That is, even according to tariffs, you can orient me at least, how much it costs, you cannot? <br>  - In the bank this information. <br><br>  <b>***, the second attempt there</b> <br>  - So, 3 months.  It turns out that roughly - I can‚Äôt tell you exactly whether the amount will be correct - but for 90 days we have a small cell, rent, it‚Äôs 2,400 rubles. <br>  - Yeah.  This is a month, right? <br>  - So, well, as far as I ... No, it's for all three months. <br>  - For all three, yes? <br>  - The total amount, yes. <br>  - Yeah.  Good.  And, maybe, you then just give me the branch phone number?  So that I call there myself? <br>  - Just in Moscow we do not have numbers, we only have internal numbers.  We can only connect you to internal numbers.  And there are no such numbers, stationary. <br>  - Yeah.  Okay. Got you.  Well, then let's try to connect again, if it does not work out, then I may call you back later.  Now maybe lunch. <br>  - Good.  Please stay on the line. <br>  (expectation) <br>  - Thanks for waiting.  Unfortunately, we were unable to contact the office right now. <br><br>  <b>***</b> <br>  - Yes, 78 rubles a day.  And, regarding the availability of free, unfortunately, we have not provided information, it is to specify this directly in the bank branch. <br>  - A, that is, I need to go to the offices according to yours, and clarify, yes, that is, so we can not pick up with you now? <br>  - So, unfortunately, we have no information about the availability of free cells in any branch of the bank. <br><br>  <b>***</b> <br>  - That for clients *** it is possible to rent a cell or safe. <br>  - Yeah.  Good.  And how can I become a client ***? <br>  - You respectively come to the office, apply for opening a card, and there they will tell you further - for ordinary customers, for customers ***.  But there still need to maintain a fairly substantial amount of balance on this card. <br>  - Ah, well, that is, as if, so quickly I can not do it. <br>  - No, no, no, quickly it will not work, I'm afraid. <br><br>  <b>***</b> <br>  - There are at the metro station ***, ***, ***, ***.  Or maybe you will orient me, what area is more convenient for you?  What is the metro station? <br>  - I would have a gray branch in the North.  Dmitrovskaya fits.  If there is Otradnoe, Timiryazevskaya.  Something like this. <br>  - Now check. <br>  - Vladykino. <br>  - There are *** - closest to these stations. <br>  - Let's see here. <br>  - Elena, in any case, you will need to go to the bank branch to order this cell.  I will now check availability - height 30 cm., 15-20 cm. Width.  Just a moment please.  Thanks for waiting.  Yes, there is.  Free cells are available.  How long did you want?  So I guided you on tariffs. <br>  - Two months. <br>  - For two months.  With the size you will need to decide on the cubic namely.  What subject can you not name? <br>  - Not. <br>  - You can not.  Look at the height.  They said height - 30 cm. Height - 30, width - 15-20, you said.  Does length matter? <br>  - They are there about 10 centimeters? <br>  - They are different, there are many options.  Let's say it will be the simplest cell.  Fits - 7 decimeters.  2 months if it will cost 1940 rubles. </div></div><br><br><h4>  Vendors </h4><br>  Avaya is a leading global supplier of solutions and equipment for building communication networks and enterprise IP telephony systems.
