  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Microsoft supports piracy?</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Two months ago, I bought a new laptop, which, in particular, installed a 60-day demo version of Microsoft Office 2007. For two months, I easily used this office (I even got used to the new interface), but the trial period was over, and now the office instead work offers to buy it.  As an honest citizen, I decided to pay several thousand rubles for the pleasure of using licensed software - and clicked <em>"I want to buy via the Internet</em> . <em>"</em> <br><br><a name="habracut"></a>  As expected, the browser opened and leaving me in different urls, brought to the English site, offered to choose a version and put it in the basket.  True, the site confidently believed that I live in Bulgaria and I will buy there, but I managed to convince him.  I was about to get a credit card, but I was alarmed that there was some upgrade version of the selected office in the basket. <br><br>  Then I opened the microsoft.ru website in a browser and tried to buy an office from there.  Again, I was ready to immediately part with a decent amount of money - but the global corporation did not want to use it, and after filling out the inconvenient form I was offered only a long list of companies where you can buy software from microsoft.  There was no option with the purchase via the Internet (as on the English-language website), the names of the packages and editions were completely different, the prices were also different.

      I finally got confused, and called the support service.  There they explained to me in a dry and inhospitable language that they could not help me to solve this problem, because Microsoft Russia itself does not deal with sales, which partner to contact, they cannot advise me, and in general I don‚Äôt really need them as a client.  Oh yeah, and the upgrade version offered on the English-language site, I definitely would not fit. <br><br>  In general, after spending two hours of my time, I understood well, or rather felt about why everyone in Russia uses the illegal software from microsoft.  No, I will not put a pirated version - it is just disgusting.  Only ten minutes later I put Open Office - and it looks like it fully meets my needs. <br><br>  <font color="gray">UPDATE: Since my post climbed to the main page and got quite a resonance, I‚Äôll add a disclaimer.</font>  <font color="gray">Of course, I don‚Äôt blame Microsoft for supporting piracy.</font>  <font color="gray">Moreover, I respect this company and the people who work in it (at least those with whom you personally know).</font>  <font color="gray">But with this post I want to point out the extreme inconvenience for the Russian user (I suspect that in the states things are still better).</font> <br><br>  UPDATE2: I am pleased to declare that I still went through the thorny path of buying licensed software (by the way, thanks for the help to the SoftKey store managers) - and purchased the activation key for Microsoft Office 2007 Small Business - and use it successfully <b>:)</b> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/30465/">https://habr.com/ru/post/30465/</a></p>
