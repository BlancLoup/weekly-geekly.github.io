      <b>Application economics</b> <br><br>  The economy of applications in 2013 is 68 billion dollars, by 2016 it is projected to reach 143 billion.  This is 2.3 million developers.  The main area of ‚Äã‚Äãtheir concentration is Asia, there are 760,000 developers. <br><br>  <b>Ecosystem warfare</b> <br><br>  After six years, the war of mobile ecosystems has been reduced to two participants - Android and iOS took 94% of the market in Q4 2013. <br><br>  Android continues to occupy the attention of developers, 71% write for it. <br><br>  Attention iOS gives 55%, the position of the system is strong in Europe and North America, but it ranks third in Asia, South America, the Middle East and Africa. <br><br>  To attract developers, Firefox OS, Windows Phone, Windows 8, Tizen, Jolla, <br>  and Ubuntu need to convince 69% of developers to abandon iOS or Android, they choose them as the main platform. <br><br>  HTML5 is a hosting platform and technology for creating native applications.  37% of mobile developers use HTML5 as a platform, that is, it develops mobile sites or web applications.  Another 15% uses HTML5 for hybrid apps. <br><br>  On average, the developer uses 2.5 platforms, which is less than 2.9 in the previous survey, which indicates consolidation around the main systems. <br><br>  There is no such thing as an average developer.  Everyone has different goals. <br><br>  <b>Developer Loyalty</b> <br><br>  IOS has the most loyal developers, 59% of those using it prefer it to the main platforms.  For many developers, the question now is not for which platform to develop, but for which one to develop first. <br><br>  HTML5 preference is limited to cross-screen and cross-platform applications.  On average, HTML5 is 2.8 screens, more than Android and iOS. <br><br>  iOS is preferred by developers in North America and Western Europe, Android wins in all other regions.  The difference is especially noticeable in Asia, here 46% are preferred by Android and only 28% by iOS. <br><br>  <b>Related screens</b> <br><br>  Despite all the hype around the clock, TV and thermostats, smartphones are and in the near future will remain the main goal for application developers. <br><br>  Tablets are a ‚Äúrelated‚Äù feature: tablets attract the attention of 83% of developers, but only 12% see their main target device in tablets. <br><br>  Despite the flow of tablets on Android, 52% of developers from those that target tablets, choose iOS, and only 28% of Android. <br><br>  <b>Income</b> <br><br>  60% of developers are ‚Äúbelow the level of profitability‚Äù, that is, they receive less than $ 500 a month. <br><br>  IOS has more ‚Äúmiddle class‚Äù than Android.  Among developers who receive between $ 500 and $ 10,000, 37% prefer iOS and 25% Android. <br><br>  Built-in advertising remains a popular earnings model, especially on those platforms where demand for purchases is low, such as Windows Phone or Android. <br><br>  Development to order is 56% of the entire economy of applications in 2013. This is, moreover, the most popular revenue-generating model, 26% of developers make applications to order. <br><br>  The popularity of e-Commerce as a method of earning has grown from 5% to 8%. <br><br>  The average income for e-Commerce is $ 2,750 per app per month, the largest for all earnings models.  The growth of e-Commerce is the first sign that developers are switching from innovative development to adding value. <br><br>  iOS is ahead of the rest of the system in terms of revenue from a single application.  On average, this is 750 dollars, against 150 for Android.  And, most likely, in this regard, Android in the near future is unlikely to compete with iOS. <br><br>  Developers under Windows 8 and Windows Phone receive the least amount of money from a single application, on average about $ 25 a month. <br><br>  <b>Instruments</b> <br><br>  Enterprise developers are slowly adopting tools, 25% do not use any tools, despite the fact that hundreds of vendors are targeting this segment. <br><br>  IOS has the most experienced developers, judging by the tools used. <br><br>  User analytics and cross-platform development tools are the two most popular categories of tools used by 40% and 30%, respectively. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/211520/">https://habr.com/ru/post/211520/</a></p>
