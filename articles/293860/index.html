    <h4>  Be stubborn! </h4><br>  All your friends say that ‚Äúyou are a moron,‚Äù and evil tongues dubbed the project ‚Äústillborn‚Äù?  Hammer, they do not rummage!  If you listen - then those who did this. <br><blockquote>  <b>If you still have the strength to resist public opinion, then everything will work out!</b> </blockquote><br><br><h4>  Strive for the perfect balance of income, time and prospects </h4><br>  Concentrate on what brings money today, automate the process, then think about tomorrow.  The ideal picture, which is worth striving for, looks like this: <br><blockquote><h6>  My Pareto Act for Startups </h6><br>  <b>80% of the income should take no more than 20% of the time</b> <b><br></b>  <b>the remaining 80% of the time should be invested in the future, receiving only 20% of income today.</b> </blockquote><br><br><h4>  And for the 5th time to rewrite everything from scratch - it's not scary! </h4><br>  During the work on the project, a calm attitude to failures and mistakes was developed, because we derived the formula for an ‚Äúexperienced coder‚Äù: <br><br><blockquote>  <b>Experienced coder = remake X infinity</b> </blockquote><br><br><h4>  Criticism is great! </h4><br>  First of all, people care about what you do, and that‚Äôs a plus!  Secondly, they want to help and teach their knowledge, there is the essence.  Thirdly, you need to be able to see not the negative and the complaint, but your flaw that caused it.  Fourth, your time is limited: you can think about how to fix the problem, or prove to hundreds of users that you are right - the choice is yours. <br><br><h4>  Kill the toad!  Cool product should be free! </h4><br>  The easiest way to win public attention is to do something inadequate, which many are not capable of, for example, donating the fruits of four years of your work to the masses with open source for free.  But this should be done when you understand what you will get from it and how you will continue to work with it. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/f96/d60/a91/f96d60a9197d036e008568daf147d377.jpg" alt="image"><br>  We must be generous Grandfather Frost!  :) <br><br><h3>  Bad advice: </h3><br><br><h4>  Free product can be clumsy! </h4><br>  If you think that you will be thanked for creating a free and at the same time absolutely useful product that is not understandable in work or enriched with jambs - you are mistaken!  Your users at best will keep silent, at worst - they will arrange a good black PR to your startup. <br><br><h4>  Want to kill a project - listen to the tips! </h4><br>  Due to the fact that I was trying to find those who would help us, I lost a lot of time and did a lot of useless actions.  If you do not know how to do better, then listen to those who did something like that.  And if there are none, then rely on yourself.  There will be no one to help you! <br><br><h4>  Hammer on traffic - you need the perfect product! </h4><br>  This approach nearly killed our company in 2014. <br>  Throughout 2013, we were engaged only in <a href="http://ksenmart.ru/">Ksenmart</a> , increased functionality, improved the interface, sawed templates, eventually updating the structure.  Half the work had to be done anew. <br>  Although the most important thing is to attract new users to the system, retain existing ones and engage in monetization. <br><br><h4>  If you run out of money - take a loan! </h4><br>  And the amount was small (only 500,000 rubles), and the time and budget were calculated with a margin.  But as soon as the funds arrived, urine hit the head.  For some reason, they began to do first of all not important, but useful.  For example, to issue templates to the raw structure (which then had to be rewritten).  Thus, they hung around the neck the bondage of passive consumption. <br><br><h4>  Want to lose time - look for an investor! </h4><br>  I do not know how anyone, but I came across strange people.  Perhaps my self-presentation is lame, but everyone I told about the project somehow didn‚Äôt understand how to make money on a free system. <br>  Therefore, I decided to leave this moment until there are clear figures in income.  The investor is ready to invest when you give him the formula for increasing his capital.  While this is not - hope for yourself. <br><br><h4>  Do several startups at once! </h4><br>  This is my favorite!  :) Today, for the main team of 12 people (the core of the company) we have 5 startups + a stream of customers who bring in money today.  And we do all this hard at times, sometimes 10-14 hours a day and almost no days off. <br>  But only if you are not maniacs frostbitten on our heads like us, it is better to concentrate on one thing - progress will be faster and more productive. <br><br>  Millions of mistakes were made, but in spite of this, our first ‚Äúsatellite‚Äù has already been released into ‚Äúorbit‚Äù. <br>  I sincerely wish you and your projects prosperity! <br>  With respect and love in your heart, Dmitry Lukyan. <br>  Good luck! </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/293860/">https://habr.com/ru/post/293860/</a></p>
