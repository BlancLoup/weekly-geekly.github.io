  <section class="page js-page"><h1>How to get a job in an international IT company?</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"><img width="200" height="200" src="https://habrastorage.org/files/d94/8f5/822/d948f582232b45b586639f6545ae521b.jpg" alt="image" align="left"><br>  It is believed that the demand for IT professionals in the labor market is always there, "IT specialist will never disappear."  But why then do these people have problems finding a job?  They asked to tell our HR managers about this.  Under the cat a cart and a small cart of useful tips from Parallels HR-manager Ekaterina Firsova. <br><br>  There is always a demand for IT specialists, programmers, system administrators.  And there is no doubt - within reasonable limits, of course - that a candidate applying for such positions, by definition, has high qualifications, relevant specialized education and rich experience in applying his knowledge.  Surprisingly, it is such people who find it difficult to find a job.  What is the reason for such injustice?  Yes, the fact is that professionals often incorrectly position themselves on the market, make up summaries incorrectly, do not communicate with companies sufficiently proactively.  As a result, many excellent specialists find it difficult to find a job, and companies that seem to be interested in them cannot get them.  Let's deal with this in more detail. <a name="habracut"></a><br><br><h3>  <font color="#d92231"><b>Light my mirror say</b></font> </h3><br>  Aware of their professional suitability, IT pros believe that they can easily show themselves from the best side during an interview, and therefore formally refer to the compilation of a resume.  Such a candidate writes: ‚ÄúI have experience in conducting various projects in the field of information technologies‚Äù. 
      <br>
        <script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>
        <ins class="adsbygoogle"
          style="display:block; text-align:center;"
          data-ad-layout="in-article"
          data-ad-format="fluid"
          data-ad-client="ca-pub-6974184241884155"
          data-ad-slot="8945601208"></ins>
        <script>
          (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
        </script>
      <br>
      And the problem is not even that the recruiter will not be able to understand what the candidate has in mind - he simply will not be able to find this resume.  Only those summaries in which the activities of the candidates are described in detail and detailed, with the mention of all the necessary keywords, are recruiters found using search tools, for example, HeadHunter.ru.  And without a keyword search today, no one works anymore, because every day hundreds of new resumes appear on the Internet, and it‚Äôs almost impossible to read everything. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/5ca/99f/069/5ca99f06933d48f69b0d55d42c579371.jpg"><br><br>  No less careful attention should be paid to the ‚ÄúAbout Me‚Äù summary section than to the other sections of this document.  Dedicate this block to your key skills and your vision of yourself - what you want to do in the future and who you want to become.  Yes, it is important to us what you want to do!  It is possible that we will be able to offer you a job that will interest you much more than the one to which you have responded. <br><br>  What must be in the resume is the contact details of the candidate, right under the ‚Äúheader‚Äù of the document.  It is on the mobile phone number and email address the company of your dreams will find you and invite you to a long-awaited interview, and not at all from your photo.  And if you post your photo in the text of the resume, choose a professionally taken photo.  Otherwise, it is not necessary to put photos in the resume. <br><br>  A covering letter of its kind is also a section of a resume - after all, it is his recruiters who read first, and based on it can decide whether they will read the resume or not.  Unlike the resume, which is a universal text, the cover letter should be addressed to a specific employer, take into account the specifics of the company and describe the candidate‚Äôs abilities and main achievements, which are of particular interest to this particular company.  Otherwise it is better to do without a cover letter at all. <br><br>  By writing a full resume, the candidate will do the main thing, but not all.  A common mistake is the wrong choice of resume language.  If you are responding to an English-language job, or if the vacancy indicates that you need good English proficiency (in Parallels, for example, this means that this position has an English-speaking leader) it‚Äôs straightforward to write a resume in English.  We, for example, write: "Thank you very much for the response, please translate your resume into English."  In general, all this leads to a great waste of time and effort. <br><br>  Another mistake is not to check the text for errors.  Most surprisingly, job seekers are often too lazy to correct even the errors that Microsoft Word "sees"!  And now put yourself in the place of the reader of any such text.  What does he think about the author - illiterate?  Inaccurate?  If an applicant with a light heart sends a resume to the company with dozens of errors - how will he relate to writing code? <br><br>  And please do not name the file with your resume Resume.docx.  Each recruiter receives more than one hundred files every day with the name Resume.docx.  The process of renaming and parsing these files daily takes half an hour ‚Äì hour.  This is exactly the time for which the recruiter would have time to thoroughly examine your candidature if he had it. <br><br><h3>  <font color="#d92231"><b>They asked - we answer!</b></font> </h3><br>  We met with you, and you brilliantly answered all our questions.  You are happy, and we are a little surprised - why did you, for your part, not ask us anything?  After all, when we ask you to ask questions - this is not a formality at all!  Not only the company chooses the employee, but the employee chooses the company. <br><br>  Ask about the story, about the plans of the company, about its prospects.  Both recruiters and executives at interviews are very open and ready to answer all sorts of questions about the company - after all, the more a candidate asks questions, the easier it will be for him to work in a company, and the company, believe me, is as interested in it as you are. <br><br>  When we call you for the second interview, you will meet with another manager - so, you can ask him any questions, including those that you asked at the first interview.  And even if the manager told everything in great detail, do not hesitate to ask questions.  We love your questions very much, the more questions the better!  Feel free to ask the same questions to different people, the main thing is that you have the most complete picture possible. <br><br>  Your questions in the process of negotiating your candidacy are also very important.  Feel free to call us if you think we are silent for too long.  Ask how things are going and what is happening, tell us about your situation.  Both you and us will be hurt if we call you with a job offer and you answer us: ‚ÄúI just signed another offer yesterday.  How sad it is, I wanted more for you ... ". <br><br><h3>  <font color="#d92231"><b>Attempt at writing</b></font> </h3><br>  After you make a great impression on us at the interview, we can offer you a test task.  This is not a whim or tricky move to get a piece of work done for free.  No test is ever used for commercial purposes.  Moreover, for each test over the years we have already accumulated a lot of brilliant solutions.  It is important for us to choose from among all candidates ‚Äúthe very one‚Äù who will be able to carry out tasks of any complexity, write good, understandable, competent code, check it for errors and do it all within a reasonable time. <br><br>  The practice of test tasks is in many companies, and it is quite effective - except for the fact that every now and then you have to lose very good, intelligent, extraordinary and interesting guys who do not agree to perform these tasks.  Therefore, we advise candidates not to refuse such tasks.  This is a great opportunity to prove yourself and show what you are capable of. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/9e9/04f/a59/9e904fa594b84083a343716445e4bd93.png"><br><br>  Your doubts are clear.  Therefore, we will clarify - if you come to a company with a worldwide reputation, such as Parallels, in no case do not refuse the test task.  Otherwise, think again.  Ask yourself how much you want to work in this company.  If you want so much that you are ready to donate the weekend for a test case, do it.  The worst thing that can happen to you is experience. <br><br><h3>  <font color="#d92231"><b>Fight and search</b></font> </h3><br>  A job search can go quickly and efficiently, or it can be a traumatic experience that I would not want to repeat.  To spend on this process as little time and nerve cells as possible, start by making a list of priorities and ranking them.  What is more important to you - money, tasks, free schedule, comfort in the workplace, proximity to home?  Do not choose on the basis of averaged notions about generally accepted values, choose for yourself personally. <br><br>  One of the trends of our time is remote work.  Our advice - do not attach the ability to work remotely too much.  This does not mean that we are against remote work in Parallels, we also have this option - but we always remember that most of the right decisions are made in the team - not to mention the fact that in the office you don‚Äôt have to cook dinner yourself and cook coffee. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/9b9/2f4/0d2/9b92f40d2d274782bfa3a161e357eb3a.jpg"><br><br>  What to do if there are no open vacancies in the company in which you want to work?  Do not hesitate and write.  On the Parallels website, for example, the public address is published, and all the letters that go to it are read and find their recipients.  There may be no vacancies at the moment, but they will definitely appear in two or three months, and then they will remember you.  Because we are always pleased when candidates monitor the state of the market and our activities.  Such people for us are promising applicants, a kind of personnel reserve. <br><br>  Do not believe the myth that recruiters have little knowledge of the personnel market, do not understand the candidates, and cannot appreciate what those companies can offer.  When we ask standard questions, it does not mean that we have nothing more to ask - we just want to hear your answers to these questions, to find out what you really want to do and what you can offer the company.  When you answer our identical questions, we carefully listen to you and draw different conclusions. <br><br><h3>  <font color="#d92231"><b>Find and do not give up</b></font> </h3><br>  Dear colleagues, recruiters, this section is for you.  First and foremost, I would like to say - when you are looking for your ideal candidate, remember that there are no ideal candidates.  You can search for one thing, and find something completely different - and this person will be even better than your hypothetical ideal candidate.  When you start to read the resume more attentively, asking the candidate about what is really close to him, it may become clear that this is the kind of person your company is looking for - and for a long time. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/e08/132/8a6/e081328a665a4bdcb03c418d7ad23d6f.png"><br><br>  An unsuccessful candidate has the right to know why the company refused him.  Be friendly and open, and a candidate to whom you honestly say what skills he lacks will come back to you in a year with new knowledge and skills - and you will be happy to offer him a job. <br><br>  We believe that the people who come to work with us, are not important benefits, not lunches, not massage chairs and everything else that we offer them as pleasant bonuses, but the work itself, the tasks that they will solve.  We are sure that by becoming a member of our team, any employee appreciates our corporate culture, our customs, traditions, values, and jokes.  And I think that any recruiter who also believes in his company, like me in his own, will be able to successfully select the best personnel for it. <br><br>  <b>And finally, the lines from the resume of applicants</b> ( <u>spelling and punctuation preserved</u> ): <br>  1. A beginner Ruby on Rails developer.  I want to get programming experience and straighten my arms. <br>  2. Experience in organizing concerts of Boris Moiseyev in Dagestan.  Confident use of telekinesis within the competence. <br>  3. Velikodushno I ask you to consider my resume, and not just throw it away immediately. <br>  4.
