  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Block Network start-up Mass Network will offer users a rollback in cryptocurrency for viewing ads from December</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  The <a href="https://mass.network/">Mass Network</a> project is another attempt to revive the online advertising market, only this time with the blockchain as an adrenaline injection.  The authors of the startup want to pump up a rapidly expanding <a href="https://kalkis-research.com/google-end-of-the-online-advertising-bubble">bubble of online advertising</a> , paying users for viewing advertising content and the right to collect and process their personal data - and instantly. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/7d2/3e2/dea/7d23e2dea1c54e63923a7d7f157198c3.jpg"><br><br>  Now users are often unwillingly giving large players private information about their behavior on the Internet.  In theory, in return, they should receive relevant and useful commercial information, but in practice advertisers still promote almost blindly, because of what their target audience gets only intrusive and almost always useless advertising.  More than 90% of Americans <a href="http://www.pewinternet.org/2014/11/12/public-privacy-perceptions/">believe</a> that they have lost control over access to their personal data and are confident that advertising companies use them at their own discretion. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  The low effectiveness of advertising targeting is exacerbated by the growing banner blindness of the audience and the growing use of ad blockers.  In 2015, the advertising industry received less than about $ 22 billion due to adblockers, whose activity increased by 41% over the past 12 months, reaching <a href="https://pagefair.com/blog/2015/ad-blocking-report/">198 million active users</a> .

      Trying to fight this, the giants of the advertising industry have come to the conclusion for the first time that perhaps they should make users their allies and share advertising revenues with them.  The idea itself is not new at all - but thanks to blockchain technology, it is possible that it finally has a chance to make money. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/ef5/4ce/f1a/ef54cef1a4511925b9456db43922c088.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  The Mass Network team has united the giants of the blockchain industry and the advertising world, among them representatives of such companies and startups as Colu, Mycelium, Evernote, BitFury Capital, Deutsche Bank and IBM, and at least two large Bitcoin companies are negotiating <a href="https://mass.network/mass-pressrelease.pdf">participation in the project</a> . <br><br>  The project created by ‚ÄúBitcoin super heroes‚Äù ( <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/mass-network-bitcoin-advertising/">Charlie Shrem is</a> among them) gives users monetize the usual surfing in the network, allowing you to get instant reward for viewing advertising content through the built-in P2P infrastructure, which will be based on the blockchain. <br><br>  Mass Network users will be paid Mass Coin cryptocurrency for viewing sites connected to the network and viewing advertising messages.  Mass is a product for consumers, webmasters, advertisers and data processing platforms within the real-time bidding framework ( <a href="https://mass.network/mass-pressrelease.pdf">RTB</a> ). <br><br>  Dmitry "Rass" Muraschik, production manager at Mycelium, explained that Mass Coin will exist on the basis of the Bitcoin protocol and have the same properties, including "transparency, security and transaction speed, but excluding glaring volatility."  According to the authors of the project, there are no other fully functional blockchains besides bitcoin.  Therefore, the blockchain is Bitcoin, according to representatives of the project, apparently adhering to the concept of Bitcoin-maximalism. <br><br>  An ICO brochure has been <a href="https://ico.mass.network/">published</a> on the Mass Network website, explaining how users can participate in project financing through the purchase of Mass Coin.  The project token is positioned as a once-issued virtual currency (one trillion coins, of which 700 billion will be distributed among ICO investors). <br><br>  To test the Mass service, you will have to wait several months: the one-time Mass Coin issue will be completed on December 1, 2016, the only and last distribution of coins will take place on December 2.  Additional information about the project is available <a href="http://mass.network/">on the official project website</a> . <br><br>  However, from our point of view, this project does not solve the fundamental problem of modern Internet advertising: an extremely low level of relevance.  Any types of targeting and retargeting are not yet able to achieve more than show ads on a question that you once googled and have already figured out for yourself, or on a product that you have already bought.  In reality, of course, users do not need to pay for advertising - this is ridiculous in its very essence;  the user needs an advertisement that will help him spend the money on what he needs, as efficiently as possible.  Want to go to the gym?  That's just the new room is selling subscriptions for a third of the price.  Do you update your wardrobe?  An outlet has recently opened in your area.  And so on. <br><br>  In fact, a kickback economy familiar to almost every advertiser works here.  By engaging users in viewing advertisements financially, advertisers can certainly achieve an increase in the turnover of the advertising market - which is beneficial for both advertisers and marketers of advertisers, allowing the former to earn more, and the latter - to show an increase in indicators in the authorities.  But without increasing the effectiveness of the advertisement itself, it still remains inflating the advertising bubble, comparable, in fact, with the good old ad-advertising not by those who need it, but by those who benefit from it.  As a result, the final consumer of goods and services will pay for it. <br><br>  Do you know other interesting blockchain startups?
