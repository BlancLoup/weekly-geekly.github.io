  <section class="page js-page"><h1>The right winter gloves for the correct boom. Take the second</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  When I published this topic a week ago on Habr√©, I could not understand to which other hub to attach it.  Still, he was on the verge of a foul and the main subject concerned very indirectly.  As a result, he practically did not go beyond the corporate blog, shlopotal a bunch of minuses "for blurring" and almost no one saw him.  Although the topic - I still think so - is interesting and useful. <br><br>  Now, with the transition to a new resource and changing the requirements for topics, I would like to publish it again.  I hope you will find it necessary.  At least, I tried very hard to make it that way. <br><br><hr><br>  At the time of the Nokia 3310, everything was simple.  Even in the most severe frost, you could easily press the call receiving button or send SMS directly from your pocket (yes, there were such craftsmen).  However, with the advent of touch screens, everything became much more complicated.  And if in spring and summer it is quite comfortable to poke around the screen with your bare finger, then in winter and dank autumn this quest is given with difficulty.

      I knew a girl who once bought a smartphone on Windows Phone.  There, to unlock the phone you want to do svayp up.  So, the girl learned to do this movement with her nose, just to not get her hands out of gloves one more time.  And then, if the event on the screen was really important, thin fingers were removed to the cold.  Needless to say that in winter our correspondence was concise? <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/404/d97/645/404d976452e445b49c02d36289fa83f6.jpg"><br><br>  There are several models on the market that support the so-called Glove Mode - the operation mode in gloves.  However, there are not so many of them in relation to the total number of phones, and this mode pretty well eats the battery.  And in general, as a rule, the best phones in terms of price / quality ratio are usually deprived of this function.  Therefore, I solve this issue with the help of touch gloves.  Surprisingly, this simple thing still stupid many acquaintances.  Including those who have long been with the technique on "hey, you."  Actually, this topic will be dedicated to choosing the right winter gloves. <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  Lyrical digression: as in the case of the post about the <a href="http://vybor-prost.ru/2015/07/30/best-bags/">right bags</a> , I can not say that I am such an authority in gloves.  The last two years, as a rule, I used copies from Euroset for 450 rubles per pair.  During one winter, I wore 2-3 such sets of gloves and didn‚Äôt worry much about it.  Well, they wear out, well, some threads inside, on which the fingers regularly stumble and tear something, well, holes in the fingers appear - only the accuracy of the print increases. <br><br>  <s>But everything changes when they come</s> .  Everything changed a bit when I came across <a href="http://thewirecutter.com/">TheWireCutter.com</a> .  The main idea of ‚Äã‚Äãthe site is to deprive the user of the flour of choice and in each individual category show the best product.  At first, I bought a Kindle cover on a site.  Friends, it was really a very good and high-quality cover, worth only $ 12 (since then I regularly order the same to my friends).  Then, in the same place, I found an excellent laptop bag (or rather, not so, at first I saw how thoughtful the bags could be, then I could not use the current one more, then I bought it ... but I wanted to write a separate post about it).  In general, I wanted to say that the guys are really good at their job.  And their choice, if not perfect, then at least, is very, very good. <br><br>  So what do TheWireCutter editors write?  First, if you have your favorite gloves and you like tinkering, then for $ 10 you can buy a <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Conductive-thread-screen-gloves-texting/dp/B00GG3US4S/ref%3Dsr_1_1%3Fs%3Dindustrial%26ie%3DUTF8%26qid%3D1412741349%26sr%3D1-1%26keywords%3DConductive%2Bthread%2Bfor%2Btouch%2Bscreen%2Bgloves.%2BMake%2Byour%2Bown%2BiPhone%2Bgloves%252C%2Btexting%2Bgloves%2521">metallic thread</a> that allows you to turn almost any gloves into sensory ones.  There is enough thread for about 20 fingers.  A sort of DIY for those who like to embroider. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/4f1/337/0dc/4f13370dc68b4fc0b98c53accd2f5e16.jpg"><br><br>  Secondly, if needlework is alien to you, the editors of the site claim that <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B005WT0266%3Ftag%3Dthewire06-20%26link_code%3Dur2%26creative%3D9325%26camp%3D211189">Glider Gloves Winter</a> gloves for $ 30 is the right choice today. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/116/dd5/d7c/116dd5d7ced645f6b882f77018b67dfc.jpg"><br><br>  How was the test.  I will quote a small paragraph from the review ‚Äú... our choice is the result of teamwork that has been going on for two years.  In total, we tested 12 types of gloves.  Our last test round took place in November, December and January in the state of Origon, where we wore gloves on a daily basis: hiking, walking around the city in the evenings and even skiing for a few days.  In this time period, we found both the autumn cooling and the so-called Polar Vortex.  We spent another 20 hours of research and tested another 9 new glove models to determine the winner. ‚Äù <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/ead/43a/ba4/ead43aba45164a46b92bbb993a60bae5.jpg"><br><br>  By the way, a funny fact, there is a specialized site <a href="http://touchscreenglovereviews.com/">TouchScreenGloveReviews.com</a> , the test results of which were also taken into account when testing gloves. <br><br>  In addition to simply using personal devices, the editors tried to standardize their experience with each pair of gloves.  Therefore, they worked with at least two devices from the list: iPhone, Motorola Atrix 2, iPad2 and Nexus 7. The following was done on all devices: <br><br><ol><li>  Swype and typing on the on-screen keyboard and sending messages via Twitter, Facebook or SMS; </li><li>  A set of e-mails, including without autochange; </li><li>  Switch between open source programs; </li><li>  Change the mode of operation of the device (on / off wireless networks, airplane mode, etc.); </li><li>  Play 10 minutes of games.  For example in GTA3, Field Runners and Real Racing 2. </li></ol><br><br>  It turned out that knitted gloves are generally the undisputed leaders, since the absence of seams can significantly increase the accuracy of pressing.  In addition, double-layer gloves were predictably warmer and surprisingly as precise as single-layer gloves.  At the same time, significantly prolonging the time of comfortable location of hands outside the pockets. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/62a/f9e/c7c/62af9ec7ccad4261a4ab8737bb30082d.jpg"><br>  <i>Left single-layer (winner of past testing), right double-layer gloves.</i>  <i>The authors of the review draw attention to the inconvenient ‚Äúgoodness‚Äù at the tips of single-layer gloves, making them less ‚Äúpredictable‚Äù in the set compared to double-layer gloves.</i> <br><br>  Another important point was that the rubberized surface of the gloves allows you to hold the device in your hand much more firmly and use it comfortably with one hand.  And finally - when the entire surface of the glove is conducted, it is much more convenient than just the fingertips. <br><br>  Thus, Glider Gloves Winter has become the leader among the tests (currently sold on Amazon at a 20% discount and cost between $ 22 and $ 25, depending on color and size).  Interestingly, last time the leader was single-layer gloves of the same manufacturer Glider Gloves Urban.  But, as mentioned above, the two-layer authors seemed warmer and more accurate. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/032/be6/e61/032be6e6129947ffbf02832f92ed6114.jpg"><br><br>  If for some reason you don‚Äôt like these gloves (for example, you are wearing a watch, as in the photo above and you need a tight fit to your wrist), <a href="http://www.mujjo.com/double-layered-touchscreen-gloves">Mujjo's Double Layered glove</a> gloves for $ 33 were the second for convenience.  They feature a small leather clasp and a slightly different surface structure. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/356/3e2/f0c/3563e2f0c381424cb0d65dd6c2601279.jpg"><br><br>  As the authors write, the leather buckle, although it looks better, imposes certain restrictions on washing.  And any "sensory" gloves must be washed regularly, otherwise they lose their conductivity.  Otherwise, these gloves are almost the complete equivalent of Glider Gloves Winter. <br><br>  It should be noted that both options proposed by the authors have a significant limitation in style, and do not fit every clothing.  But, thank God, IT-shnik in this regard is a little easier.  Well, if you are still a victim of corporate style (as happens with many, including me), then for you there are only two options: almost classic leather <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00G9G4ONS%3Ftag%3Dthewire06-20%26link_code%3Dur2%26creative%3D9325%26camp%3D211189">Glider Gloves Winter</a> for $ 95 <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/99c/2d1/ff4/99c2d1ff4fd6450094177ad2ba85c807.jpg"><br><br>  or beautiful <a href="http://www.mujjo.com/leather-crochet-touchscreen-gloves">Mujjo Leather Crochet Touchscreen Gloves</a> for $ 100, made from Ethiopian leather and Egyptian cotton (what would these words mean). <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/51c/c4a/e45/51cc4ae45c4249c9abfe1f71f7f03c0f.jpg"><br><br>  But again, due to the presence of seams, these gloves are noticeably inferior in accuracy to the first two winners.  But surpass them in their appearance. <br><br>  I remind you that you read the blog of the company Shopozz, a free Mail Forwarding service from the USA.
