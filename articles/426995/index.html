This pressure is masked by various euphemisms: beautiful words about the mission, personal contribution, forced march.  Those who are willing to recycle often receive encouraging attention from management: ‚ÄúJoe gave a hundred and fifty percent to help us achieve our goals: he worked late, went out on the weekend.  He sacrificed his time for our mission. ‚Äù <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/_i/vw/y3/_ivwy3_qeafvxfjqurursve0asq.jpeg"></div><br><br>  Fortunately, I myself did not have to work in companies where my disgust at overtime work would have been disapproved.  Nevertheless, I believe that it is unacceptable to even speak of such practice approvingly.  This is a symptom of problems that cannot be encouraged.  Under no circumstances.

      In essence, the need for processing comes from problems with professionalism, prioritization and flexibility.  I, for the most part, will talk about overtime work in IT companies, but the same negative impact on productivity and quality of work can be observed in any other sphere. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h4>  Professionalism </h4><br>  Professionalism is tied to discipline.  In any case, the development of skills and competence requires discipline.  Processing also shows that the scheduling of a company is approached carelessly (and not only to it).  But the main thing - it shows the inability to enclose the work process in a clear framework and not allow it to crowd out other activities. <br><br>  The phrase ‚Äúwork till you drop and rest to the fullest‚Äù is often associated with a way of thinking that encourages people to recycle.  The idea here is that you do not need to spare yourself when you go towards some goal, but when it is achieved, you can allow yourself to be pulled to the fullest.  But what if this moment never comes, that if there is simply no time to rest, because one goal will always be followed by another?  If you accept recycling as the norm, such an attitude will begin to generate new and new reasons to work late, so it will never come to the second part of the quotation. <br><br>  The phrase sounds more reasonable: ‚Äúwork in full force, and then go home.‚Äù  Here it is assumed that between work and other aspects of our lives some kind of balance is maintained.  Every day we come to work, we make every effort to do everything that is required, and then, when working time goes, we get up and go home.  What we do when the daily amount of work is done is our concern.  We have to completely leave everything related to work, at work, and to manage our own time. <br><br>  This approach returns people the opportunity to decide what is important to them.  Someone might say that they just want to give priority to work, but even in this case, recycling is not the best way;  later we will look at several reasons why.  Professionalism is impossible without respect for foreign boundaries and discipline.  Therefore, it is impossible to force people to choose between career and family, work and friends, activities and entertainment.  Professionals and organizations that want maximum productivity from them should strictly maintain this balance. <br><br><h4>  Priorities </h4><br>  Another area closely associated with professionalism is prioritization.  In the overwhelming majority of cases, when I was asked to work a little longer or when I watched similar cases from the outside, all the fuss started with the fact that someone got confused, which of the tasks is more important.  Someone has gotten into the prioritization somewhere.  The most important and urgent work is not planned for the most successful time.  Of course, it happens that in the process of work errors occur or circumstances change.  But more often it is about the wrong priorities. <br><br>  In turn, this is due to a drawdown in communication.  It is necessary to ensure that during the work of the team regularly and clearly give each other feedback.  Whenever this rule is violated, the risk that we are not doing what most needs attention at the current moment increases.  The reality is this: if the value of something is not quite clear, you should not waste time on it.  Efforts to eliminate any ambiguities help to focus on the essentials.  If we can outline the meaning of this or that action, most likely, there is no need to perform it at all.  Wrong priorities call into question the success of the product - after all, we are not sure that exactly what users need is done. <br><br>  When the value of actions is clearly defined and they are arranged in order of importance, it becomes easier to plan the procedure.  Understanding the value makes it possible to correctly set the scale and build a schedule.  More significant things can be raised to the top, and less significant things - to postpone or even throw out of the plan.  The emphasis on the importance of priorities allows us to get rid of one of the root causes of the need for processing and return to a normal schedule. <br><br><h4>  Out of schedule </h4><br>  For the past fifteen years, I have mostly worked as a programmer.  But in the intervals between writing the code, I also did a lot of business computer support.  Sometimes these systems failed and, to fix the problem, had to work out of schedule.  This is also part of the work process - the need to sometimes redistribute working hours.  But - and here we are again returning to the issue of professionalism - this should not result in the fact that the employee works full time, and then he also spends his personal time. <br><br>  I was lucky: I worked in companies where I didn‚Äôt object, so that in the event of unforeseen situations I changed my schedule accordingly.  If at two o'clock in the morning I repaired the server, then no one expected that the next morning I would return to the office and work as always.  My daily duties shifted so that I could make up for lost time on rest and save myself from burning out.  It is important to separate such adjustments in the working mode, which one has to resort to when someone needs to work out of schedule, and coercion to work overtime (or even voluntary consent to it). <br><br><h4>  Flexibility </h4><br>  The first principle in the <a href="http://agilemanifesto.org/">Agile</a> software <a href="http://agilemanifesto.org/">development manifest</a> is: "People and interaction are more important than processes and tools."  Any organization that follows a flexible development methodology thinks first about its employees.  In order for the necessary work to be done well, you must first take care that the people who will do it are well.  Also among the <a href="http://agilemanifesto.org/principles.html">principles</a> that formed the basis of the manifesto, mention is made of the need to adhere to the pace of development that is realistic in the long term. <br><br>  Recycling directly contradicts this principle.  The fact that there is a need for it means that a failure has occurred in the processes.  In a flexible organization, overtime indicates that there are other systemic problems.  So reconsider priorities, volumes, quality, identify the problem and solve it, whatever the matter.  Do not get out of the situation simply by accepting recycling as something inevitable or necessary. <br><br>  One of the requirements of the Agile system is a healthy balance in the life of employees, that is, an opportunity to relax.  Work will not be effective if it turns into an endless continuous process.  Sooner or later we will start to give out a bad result, and then we will be forced to stay at work even longer and redo what did not work out the first time.  Therefore, it is easier to deal with the shortcomings in the system that cause the need for recycling, and then such jumps in recoil can be avoided. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/fu/ha/2c/fuha2cyyqxkdnzisv9l-jwocje0.jpeg"></div><br><br><h4>  Productivity </h4><br>  To all of the above, <a href="https://www.entrepreneur.com/article/288359">research shows</a> that recycling is a waste of time.  The longer people regularly work overtime, the more their productivity decreases.  And apparently, this recession completely cancels that quantitative increase which is given by additional hours.  New data indicates that sitting up in the office until late, we do about the same amount of work as usual, only at a slower pace.  Overtime, as the article title hints at the link, is simply useless. <br><br>  Recycling is bad for productivity for a variety of reasons, so it‚Äôs best to avoid it by default.  Why kill time for ineffective attempts to work, when you can just pause, have a good rest and return to full combat readiness?  There are no convincing arguments in favor of this practice - we just taught ourselves to perceive it as the norm.  We are engaged in self-deception, remaining deaf to what science and our own intuition say. <br><br><h4>  Quality </h4><br>  Finally, there is still the issue of quality.  Processing does not contribute to the discipline and consolidation of good practices that allow you to consistently maintain the quality of work at a high level.  It is in itself a way to ‚Äúcut corners‚Äù, and a similar attitude percolates into the process of performing overtime tasks.  The fact that we have to work late means that we are prevented from writing code thoughtfully and without haste. <br><br>  From the fact that we are losing the motivation to think about what we are doing and to keep order in our work, the quality of products begins to fall.  We are increasingly beginning to do without tests, because there seems to be nothing complicated in this part of the functional.  We arrogantly decide that you can make good products without bothering to think in perspective and use appropriate methods.  Such arrogance never justifies itself: we all tend to overestimate our capabilities.  Practices for long-term maintenance of quality and work discipline are the best help to keep a sober look at the product.  Recycling takes our key component of both these things - time. <br><br>  Product quality inevitably suffers when overtime becomes commonplace.  Sometimes this does not happen immediately, but as it begins to be considered an acceptable way out and welcomed, sensible practices gradually break down and even the best developers of the company suppress a responsible attitude towards the fulfillment of tasks.  If we want to keep quality products and a strong team, recycling should not turn into the norm.  It never in reality brings the advantages that it promises, and often we do not even suspect what price we pay until it drops a huge bill. <br><br>  * <br>  How to solve this problem?  Well, personally, I just refuse to work overtime.  I do not hide irritation when I hear that someone is praised for staying up late.  I defend the interests of those who do not do it myself, whether they like it or not.  In general, one should begin with the fact that it is clearly designated: recycling is a problem.  The first step is to be. <br><br>  Overtime is a sign of a system failure, a signal that something has gone wrong somewhere.  If someone had to work more than the allotted time, we must do everything to prevent similar situations in the future.  We can not allow the processing turned into a professional burnout - and by encouraging it, this is what we are going to.  On this account in the organizations there should be reinforced concrete rules. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/426995/">https://habr.com/ru/post/426995/</a></p>
