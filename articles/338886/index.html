Welcome to the Mars Information Services (Mars IS) blog. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/59/cc/b9/59ccb963660b7238849220.png"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h2>  The digital component of the chocolate bar </h2><br>  Mars has been working in Russia since 1991.  Today, the company has ten factories in four regions of the country, and since 1996 the head office in Russia was located in the Moscow region city of Stupino, and in 2016 it moved to Moscow, on Leningradsky Prospect.

      Mars IS is responsible for the IT solutions and infrastructure of all Mars offices and factories.  Our team consists of one and a half thousand specialists around the world, including about 200 in Stupino.  By the way, many of them can work from home, in consultation with management.  Our Russian employees in Stupino provide technological leadership, thanks to which the company's productivity increases, and the interaction and efficiency of all Mars employees improves. <br><br>  Our specialists work in almost all areas of IT: telecommunications (including IP telephony), business applications, personal computers and servers, mobile devices, data centers, infrastructure technologies (Unix, Linux, Windows, Oracle), development, support and implementation IT solutions.  Mars IS has a highly professional SAP implementation and support team. <br><br>  All internal processes are consistent with advanced international industrial practices.  Service work is carried out according to ITIL standards, which allows you to be confident in the quality of all the services provided.  For their projects, the company uses generally accepted methodologies: Prince2, Waterfall, Scrum.  In addition, our team has experience in supporting infrastructure or business applications, as well as knowledge of the main IT management practices - ITIL, COBIT, Lean IT, MOF, and others. <br>  <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/users/suglosta/" class="user_link">suglosta</a> <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/59/cc/b4/59ccb4e4a53c4157896700.png"><br><br><h2>  The main directions of our work </h2><br>  Mars IS has three main areas of management: management of implementation, services and relationships with the company's business units. <br>  The <b>implementation management</b> team is responsible for coordinating the installation of new software and hardware.  And also responsible for the commissioning of new processes, equipment, software, documentation.  The largest project of the department is the implementation of the SAP application in the CIS. <br><br>  <b>Service management</b> is the control of operational and organizational processes, the detection of problems and their timely elimination.  This division has a user support center for solving all IT incidents and requests.  Our specialists develop recommendations for improving processes, set objectives for service providers and evaluate their work. <br><br>  Specialists in <b>managing relationships with business units</b> determine the need for IT services and business applications and plan the appropriate budget for their implementation.  They are also responsible for providing information on the quality of service and are irreplaceable in cases where already tested and proven processes fail.  I would like to tell about this division in more detail. <br><br><h2>  Our main capital is people. </h2><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/59/cc/b4/59ccb489cb485205592861.jpeg"><br><br>  As part of the <b>Business relationship management</b> process, department employees regularly meet with senior <b>management</b> at Mars‚Äôs business units and discuss emerging issues related to the IT solutions used in these departments. <br><br>  The process of <b>Business portfolio management</b> involves monitoring the relevance of a set of solutions and tools.  As needed, legacy systems and applications are decommissioned and new ones launched. <br><br>  The <b>Business continuity management</b> process is responsible for the continuity of IT support for the company's business structures.  This is a comprehensive approach aimed at identifying potential threats, analyzing their impact and adjusting recovery processes after failures. <br><br>  Examples of projects that have been implemented by this unit: <br><br><ul><li>  automation of warehouse inspectors using SalesForce technologies and a mobile application for the iOS platform; </li><li>  creation of a resolution center for issues related to the work of the logistics department using SalesForce technologies; </li><li>  introduction of electronic document management service (via EDI) for the exchange of invoices with major retail chains; </li><li>  development and implementation of a system for collecting and managing promotional activities of the Collaborative Activity Management system; </li><li>  development and implementation of a system for predicting the distribution of products in warehouses - Demand 2 Supply. </li></ul><br>  <i>In the future, we plan to tell you more about the work of each of our departments and will be happy to share our experience and best practices.</i>  <i>Read the following material in a week.</i> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/338886/">https://habr.com/ru/post/338886/</a></p>
