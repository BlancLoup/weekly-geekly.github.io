We can rightly be proud of our athletes who have proved the limitless possibilities of the human body, the predominance of fortitude over physical difficulties.

      Such games, of course, are important not only for athletes, but also for all other residents of our country.  For those who are not satisfied with their lives, this example of endurance, perseverance and dedication, shown by athletes with disabilities, becomes a good ‚Äúkick‚Äù, a silent reproach ‚ÄúAnd what have you achieved?‚Äù. <br><br>  Another advantage of such games is to attract public attention to people with disabilities, and the problems that they face.  After all, most people who are physically healthy do not even know how difficult life of people with disabilities can be, and what difficulties even the most trivial things can cause (such as working at a computer for people with poor eyesight).  Do we often, habrazhiteli, creating Internet projects, make a version for the visually impaired? <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  For many of us, employees of the Mail.ru Group, the Paralympic Games also became an incentive for a more attentive attitude to this problem. <br><br>  So, ‚ÄúWelcome Mail.ru‚Äù launches the educational project ‚Äú <a href="http://dobro.mail.ru/education/">Limitless Opportunities</a> ‚Äù, in which people with disabilities will be able to get free online specialties that are in demand in the market.  For people with disabilities the best support is integration into society, the opportunity to get an education and interesting work. <br><br>  Everyone will be able to choose one of six online courses: <br><ul><li>  Content marketing </li><li>  Internet Marketing </li><li>  Web design </li><li>  Internet project management </li><li>  SMM Manager </li><li>  Online Store Manager </li></ul><br><br>  To do this, just fill out an application and tell in a small essay why this or that specialty is chosen. <br><br>  The project was launched with the support of the regional public organization of persons with disabilities "Perspective", which has been engaged in the employment of people with disabilities for over 15 years. <br><br>  Today, more and more companies are ready to hire people with disabilities.  The employer is interested in the skills and professional capabilities of future employees, however, unfortunately, many of them are clearly not enough.  The project is precisely aimed at helping to get the knowledge demanded by the market.  And the fact that courses are held online is very convenient for people with disabilities who find it difficult even to get to the store nearest to their home, and not to get to the training center. <br><br>  ‚ÄúPerspective‚Äù will directly select the participants.  Training can be difficult for people with serious hearing and visual impairments, but is perfectly comfortable for others. <br><br>  Training will be conducted on the basis of the Netology online education center.  At the same time, special groups for students with disabilities will not be created, they will be provided with two free places on each of the training courses.  That is, they will study on a common basis and with other students. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/216617/">https://habr.com/ru/post/216617/</a></p>
