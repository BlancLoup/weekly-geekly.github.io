Briefly about what will be in each section. <br><br><h3>  <b>What will happen in the <a href="http://dump-conf.ru/section/27/%3Futm_source%3Dhabr%26utm_campaign%3D9.03%26utm_medium%3Dpost">FrontTalks</a> section</b> </h3><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/09d/7a7/c6c/09d7a7c6ce244e6eb9d77e14a720bd3f.png" alt="image"><br><br>  ‚Ä¢ For the first time <b>Nikita Prokopov</b> will come to us <b>(Cognician, Novosibirsk)</b> .  Nikita will tell how you can do client-server communication of a new generation: advanced data models, high-level APIs, event logs, etc.  It will also show complex scenarios, tell you about problems and explain how they can be solved and what tools are available for this. <br><br>  ‚Ä¢ <b>Igor Alekseenko (HTML Academy, St. Petersburg)</b> will show with examples, when you need to rely on caching, and in which you can trust the processor. <br><br>  ‚Ä¢ Many C ++, Java, and C # developers warmly welcomed TypeScript ‚Äî it was only a matter of time for many Web SDKs to be completely rewritten to TypeScript.  <b>Grigory Petrov</b> , a technical evangelist at <b>Voximplant</b> (Moscow), in the report will focus on the difficulties that can be encountered during porting, and on expectations that may or may not be justified by such a change in technology stack. <br><br>  ‚Ä¢ <b>Artyom Kuvaldin (Yandex, Yekaterinburg)</b> will tell you how to use Service Workers technology to make any web page accessible without the Internet, and also to show where they already use this technology in Yandex. <br><br>  ‚Ä¢ <b>Artyom Kuzvesov (Ideco, Ekaterinburg)</b> will give a talk about the RESTful API, compare ready-made solutions for API documentation, tell about the swagger;  teach you how you can immediately check and test your documentation and how beautiful it is to display. <br><br>  ‚Ä¢ The larger and more complex the project becomes, the more often you have to solve a performance problem.  <b>Yaroslav Lyzlov</b> from <b>Bank "Tochka"</b> (Ekaterinburg) will tell why they decided to change the framework, chose Angular, decided to move to TypeScript and why they decided to make a hybrid application. <br><br>  There is one free space in the section, if you want to speak, write to elena.fkr@gmail.com. <br><br><h3>  <b>What will happen in the <a href="http://dump-conf.ru/section/28/%3Futm_source%3Dhabr%26utm_campaign%3D9.03%26utm_medium%3Dpost">Serverside</a> section</b> </h3><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/b81/74d/ac4/b8174dac482445c49fcfff6cfdd9d55c.png" alt="image"><br><br>  ‚Ä¢ <b>Andrei Akinshin</b> from <b>JetBrains</b> will tell you about the long-awaited .NET cross-platform, its capabilities and impossibilities at the moment. <br><br>  ‚Ä¢ HYIP around chatbot does not subside for about a year.  <b>Alexey Mogilnikov (ConfBot / iiko, Moscow)</b> on a simple example will show how to write an interesting chatbot.  The example will be in Ruby, but chatbot is a story in which the language is even less important than usual.  So, even if you are not a rubist, it will still be clear and useful. <br><br>  ‚Ä¢ Recently, the topic of high-speed traffic processing has become increasingly popular.  But the core of the operating system often prevents really high speeds.  <b>Ivan Spinenko (Ideco, Yekaterinburg)</b> will tell you how to get around this using the Netmap framework. <br><br>  ‚Ä¢ <b>Andrei Fefelov (Mastery.pro, Ekaterinburg)</b> will tell how they did BI (this is such a thing with a bunch of charts for analytics) for a major pharmaceutical supplier: how they set data analysis tasks, how OLAP differs from OLTP;  pros and cons of solution architecture;  why Postgres is suitable for the role of not only the storage, but also the ETL (extract transform load) layer. <br><br>  ‚Ä¢ <b>Ilya Egorov (dvizh / nethammer, Kurgan)</b> using the example of the modular architecture of PHP frameworks will show the place and method of isolating business logic in Enterprise solutions and large E-commerce sites. <br><br>  ‚Ä¢ <b>Alexander Serbul</b> , head of the quality and implementation department of <b>1C-Bitrix</b> (Moscow), will talk about the pitfalls in analyzing and designing distributed recommendation and clustering algorithms, implementing the service based on the modern stack and ready-made libraries: java, Apache Spark, Apache Mahout, testing and quality metrics. <br><br>  ‚Ä¢ If you work with a large number of different texts, at some point you want to automatically get information about what essentially each of these texts is about.  <b>Ruslan Talipov (Ridero, Yekaterinburg) will</b> explain how to solve this problem with the help of thematic modeling - one of the applications of machine learning to the analysis of texts. <br><br>  ‚Ä¢ <b>Andrey Litunenko (2GIS, Novosibirsk)</b> will teach everyone his recipe for preparing Elasticsearch + Logstash + Kibana in conjunction with Prometheus for high-quality logging in your PHP application. <br><br>  ‚Ä¢ Each framework / programming language offers you its own way of making a ‚Äúlive‚Äù web.  Will there be a standard in this area that will finally ‚Äúfly up‚Äù?  <b>Vladimir Dementiev (Evil Martians, Moscow)</b> proposes to dwell on this problem in more detail and to dream about the possibility of the emergence of the ‚Äúlive‚Äù web standard and possible implementations. <br><br><h3>  <b>What will happen in the <a href="http://dump-conf.ru/section/29/%3Futm_source%3Dhabr%26utm_campaign%3D9.03%26utm_medium%3Dpost">Mobile</a> section</b> </h3><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/e07/c3d/e92/e07c3de92d8e4054903546d901ef0b01.png" alt="image"><br><br>  ‚Ä¢ <b>Stanislav Krasnoyarov (Redsteep, St. Petersburg)</b> will talk about the basic principles and device of React Native and Redux, share his experience of developing an application for iOS, show exactly how React Native simplifies the workflow, and what are the disadvantages in it. <br><br>  ‚Ä¢ <b>Zviad Kardava</b> <b>(Voximplant, Google Developer Expert, Moscow)</b> will tell in detail what Android Things and Weave are: how the new OS differs from the usual Android, what features it has, how to develop it, and write a small demo application. <br><br>  ‚Ä¢ <b>Alexander Blinov</b> , Lead Android Developer from <b>RedMadRobot</b> (Moscow), will tell how to design the architecture of your application for work in networks with potentially slow Internet or its absence. <br><br>  ‚Ä¢ <b><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tanay_Pant">Tanay Pant</a></b> (New Delhi) from the <b>Mozilla Foundation</b> , the author of three books on programming, will tell you what WebVR is, teach you how to create applications with virtual reality, tell you about available devices for training, and give recommendations on getting started with WebVR.

What are ‚Äúvisible changes‚Äù and how would we see them?  Whether to roll out changes at once to all users or go the other way?  Wait until the time is available for the feature from regular developers, or to look for any other free ones?  <b>Igor Goldberg (SKB Kontur)</b> will tell how they answer these questions by making Kontur.
