After a while everything cleared up, and the bloggers stopped worrying about it.  In general, it is not a secret that for the most part domestic Internet leaders who have their own resources, whether they are offline websites or blogs on platforms such as Livejournal.com and liveinternet.com, do not pay taxes. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a>  And this is despite the fact that the income of many bloggers reach four digits in dollar equivalent.  The situation, most likely, will not change for a long time, because almost no one follows the incomes of a single Internet user due to the complexity of the current level of technology penetration into law enforcement and financial control bodies of many CIS countries.  Not everywhere, there are exceptions, but for the most part, site owners still live in peace.

      But the United States, in particular, in Philadelphia, bloggers, as they say, pressed to the nail.  Recently, the majority of bloggers in this region received official notices from the authorities demanding to register as an entrepreneur.  Interestingly, the overwhelming majority of ‚Äúvictims‚Äù are those who have indicated their own income from blogging in the tax return.  That is, the authorities ‚Äúpress‚Äù law-abiding citizens, <s>following the principle of ‚Äúwho are lucky, they are going on that one‚Äù</s> .  Of course, some anonymous authors were also caught, but for the most part bloggers dug a hole for themselves, reporting their, in some cases, meager income. <br><br>  For example, a certain blogger earned as much as $ 50 over several years.  Another blogger topped an even bigger sum, having received $ 11 in the last two years.  And these unfortunates are now forced to register as private entrepreneurs, and after all, a license for a state of emergency in the United States costs $ 300.  In addition to the license fee, you will also have to pay income tax, plus some other taxes. <br><br>  Now, however, the legislators of Philadelphia are trying to simplify the procedure for registering private enterprises and small enterprises. <br><br>  In general, the case is interesting.  Recently, domestic legislators are trying to somehow "monetize" the shadow Internet business, so it is worthwhile to <s>dry the crackers to</s> prepare for such attempts. <br><br>  Generally speaking, it would be nice for lawmakers to come up with new ways of taxation for various types of Internet resources, you see, and fewer people will go into the shadows.  Although, of course, such hopes are mostly in vain.  But let's hope for the best ... <br><br>  <a href="http://www.washingtonexaminer.com/opinion/blogs/beltway-confidential/philly-requiring-bloggers-to-pay-300-for-a-business-license-101264664.html">A source</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/288216/">https://habr.com/ru/post/288216/</a></p>
