  <section class="page js-page"><h1>“Do”, “understand”, “agree”: synonyms in English</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Today, the blog decided to consider several synonymous groups with useful verbs in their work: “make (create)”, “understand”, “agree”.  For each there are several English words with different shades and meanings - if you learn to distinguish between them, it will be much easier to communicate with foreign colleagues and customers. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h2>  Do </h2><br>  Let's start with the synonymous series <b>to make - to create - to produce - to manufacture</b> .  The verb <i>“to make”</i> acts here as a synonymous dominant (a member of the group of synonyms, which brings together all the other words in the group under its common and stylistically neutral meaning). <br><br>  So, the verb <i>“to make” is</i> translated as “do” or “perform”: <br><blockquote>  "Make life easy for yourselves" - Make life easier for yourself <br><br>  “Did you make any real progress?” - Did you really manage to make progress? </blockquote><br>  If we talk about <i>“to create”</i> , then this verb mainly means not so much “doing something” as “creating”, sometimes even “creating”: <br><blockquote>  "Imagine that you wanted to use" - Imagine that you had to create everything you wanted to use with your own hands.

      "But more than that, nanotechnology will create new opportunities that we can't now see" - Moreover, nanotechnologies will create new opportunities that we do not see now </blockquote><br>  The verbs <i>“to produce”</i> and <i>“to manufacture”</i> are often used interchangeably.  However, there are some differences between them.  The <i>“to produce”</i> value is still slightly wider than the <i>“to manufacture”</i> , and many of the processes implied by <i>“to manufacture”</i> can be described using <i>“to produce”</i> . <br><br>  If <i>“to manufacture”</i> implies the processing of some raw material and the production of things that will then be used, then <i>“to produce”</i> can be applied to the creation of anything, such as objects of art. <br><blockquote>  "We already produce more than enough food to feed the planet" - we already produce more than enough food to feed the whole planet <br><br>  "On the other hand, they can give unhealthy fumes and produce unpleasant chemicals" - On the other hand, they can release unhealthy fumes and hazardous chemicals. </blockquote><br>  Also a few examples using <i>"to manufacture"</i> : <br><blockquote>  "The sugar manufacture, however, is a protected industry" - Sugar production, however, is a protected industry <br><br>  "They manufacture the best lace in the town" - They produce the best lace in the city </blockquote><br><h2>  Understand </h2><br>  Consider the synonymous group <b>to understand - to realize - to comprehend - to grasp - to figure out</b> .  <i>“To understand”</i> is a synonymous dominant, this verb unites all the others under the group meaning “to understand”: <br><blockquote>  "He must understand what Alex had been through" - He must understand what Alex had to go through <br><br>  "Now I understand why you were crying" - Now I understand why you were crying </blockquote><br>  <i>“To realize”</i> we use mainly when we want to say that we have understood some fact, realized it and accepted it. <br><blockquote>  "Your parents will realize that" - Your parents realize it. <br><br>  "He was surprised to realize he liked this feeling" - He was surprised to understand that he liked this feeling </blockquote><br>  The verb <i>“to comprehend”</i> implies more of a comprehension of something. <br><blockquote>  “I tried to comprehend his thought process but I found it irrational” - I tried to comprehend the course of his thoughts, but I came to the conclusion that he was completely irrational <br><br>  “We cannot comprehend either the Emperor's aims or his actions!” - We cannot comprehend the meaning of either the actions of the Emperor, nor what goals he pursues! </blockquote><br>  We can also include the verb <i>“to grasp”</i> in the synonymous group “understand <i>”</i> .  However, it is important to remember that he also has some peculiarities: this verb is usually used in the sense of “quickly grasping the essence of something, catching the basic idea”: <br><blockquote>  "It is important to grasp the distinction between breeds" - It is very important to understand the differences between breeds. <br><br>  "I hope you grasped the main idea" - I hope you get the main idea </blockquote><br>  <i>“To figure out”</i> we use mainly in the meaning of “find out” when we want to emphasize that something has been revealed or clarified (and often it is necessary to solve an existing problem): <br><blockquote>  "She couldn't figure out anything about them" - She couldn't figure out anything about them <br><br>  "He was trying to figure out what had happened" - He tried to find out what happened </blockquote><br><h2>  Agree </h2><br>  Consider another synonymous series: <b>to agree - to approve - to consent</b> .  Being a synonymous dominant, <i>“to agree”</i> has the most common meaning for the whole group: “agree”: <br><blockquote>  "I totally agree with you" - Totally agree with you <br><br>  "We both agree that we’re agreeing that you need to leave here for a while." </blockquote><br>  <i>“To approve”</i> , despite the fact that it also agrees, is the most “official” and patronizing of all three verbs and more means “to give permission, to approve”: <br><blockquote>  "I doubt my father would approve me of seeing you" - I doubt that my father will approve / give consent or permission for us to see <br><br>  "She won't approve you being here" - She won't approve of your being here </blockquote><br>  The verb <i>“to consent”</i> expresses more precisely its own initiative and desire to come to an agreement: <br><blockquote>  "There would be no way for everyone to travel from Boston" - He would never agree to drive all the way from Boston. <br><br>  "I don't agree, my dear, I don't!" - I do not agree, dear, I do not agree! </blockquote><br>  Very often, English learners (especially at elementary levels) prefer to use only one verb (or any other part of speech) to describe an action, ignoring its possible synonyms, which makes speech more primitive.  To avoid this, it is important to keep in mind several possible variants of one or another word. <br><br><h2>  If you want to upgrade English, come to us </h2><br>  Readers of the blog give a <a href="https://puzzle-english.com/prices%3Fcoupon_id%3D36%26pes%3Dgeektimes_synon_coup">coupon for 500 rubles</a> for the purchase of a subscription, which includes 8 types of training and weekly mailings about English grammar and vocabulary - "Vitaminki" and "Buns".
