A set of experts and the beginning of the discussion of bills</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/0ea/8f4/c33/0ea8f4c33592145c9ec1e72254f1cc2b.jpg" alt="image"></div><br><br>  Today, the platform for public discussions of draft laws submitted to the State Duma - <b>‚Äú <a href="http://veche.duma.gov.ru/">VEChE</a> ‚Äù</b> was revived. <br>  It was created quite a long time ago, if I'm not mistaken back in 2011.  There even were exhibited at one time as a test for discussion a couple of bills, but then the testing did not go further. <br>  And after raising the problem of the importance of public discussions of state initiatives and in the wake of coinciding trends on ‚Äúanti-piracy‚Äù legislative topics, resonant <a href="https://www.roi.ru/advisement/petition/gosudarstvennoe_upravlenie1/otmenit-zakon-o-proizvolnyh-blokirovkah-internet-resursov-ot-02072013-187-fz-zakon-protiv-interneta/">our petition to cancel 187-FZ</a> and the <a href="http://rublacklist.net/6414/">start of its expert discussion</a> (which caused heated discussions, including <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/194576/">on Habr√©</a> ), It was decided (not without our participation) to revive or even more likely to introduce the institution of public debate. <br>  This is essentially the prototype of the second e-democracy instrument legitimate for the state in our country.  The first was the site ROI - to collect petitions.  The second logical step is already a discussion of the proposed state for the implementation of laws. <br><br>  Yes, I want more and immediately, but let's welcome the fact that the wheels creaked and something has already moved.  If this site is the result of the <a href="http://veche.duma.gov.ru/laws/o-vnesenii-izmeneniy-v-gragdanskiy-kodeks-rf-gragdanskiy-protsessualniy-kodeks-rf-arbitragniy-protsessualniy-kodeks-rf-i-federalniy-zakon-ob-informatsii-informatsionnih-tehnologiyah-i-o-zashchite-informatsii/profile">first</a> <b>‚Äúanti-piracy‚Äù bill being</b> <a href="http://veche.duma.gov.ru/laws/o-vnesenii-izmeneniy-v-gragdanskiy-kodeks-rf-gragdanskiy-protsessualniy-kodeks-rf-arbitragniy-protsessualniy-kodeks-rf-i-federalniy-zakon-ob-informatsii-informatsionnih-tehnologiyah-i-o-zashchite-informatsii/profile">discussed therein,</a> <a href="http://asozd2.duma.gov.ru/main.nsf/(Spravka)%3FOpenAgent%26RN%3D342640-6">No. 342640-6</a> (On Amendments to the Civil Code of the Russian Federation, Civil Procedure Code of the Russian Federation, Arbitration Procedure Code of the Russian Federation and Federal Law "On Information, Information Technologies and protection of information ‚Äù) will prove its worth, it will be possible to raise the question of the legal regulation of its activities and the procedure for collecting and taking into account the opinions of citizens. <br>  At the moment, there is no direct regulation.  But I propose to draft it together with you and we will give it to the organizers of the Veche and the deputy who is currently in charge of this process - Robert Schlegel. <a name="habracut"></a>

      <br>
      Now for the functionality of the site itself. <br>  As the organizers explained, in order to avoid the influx of spam, inadequate and bots, the following registration system is being introduced: <br>  1) Invitations are sent to experts who were involved in the discussion of ‚Äúanti-piracy‚Äù topics - representatives of the IT industry, executive and legislative bodies, public organizations, etc. <br>  2) These experts, having received an invitation, can activate their profile and send out such invitations themselves to those they see fit.  Authorization is planned through the social network, but for me personally at the moment it did not work, probably this functionality is still being finalized. <br>  3) All others who wish to take part in the discussion - must be authorized through the "Gosulergi". <br>  4) Everyone has the same rights and opportunities for conducting discussions and voting.  Only authorization is different. <br>  5) The discussed bill is divided into parts and you can comment on them point-by-point and offer your alternative. <br>  6) There is a system of certain ratings, tops and polls - but I have to deal with this as I go, I cannot describe in detail at the moment. <br>  7) Set the time for discussion of the bill.  On laid out the current - until October 24. <br><br>  So.  I was invited there as an expert and now I can send invitations. <br>  <b>Anyone who wants to get access to the discussion at the Veche, but at the same time does not have an account on the state services - send me a personal e-mail and preferably your full name.</b> <br>  or here: <img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/1f6/dbb/8a2/1f6dbb8a29af2187544b5168f8f74507.png" alt="image"><br>  Since  you will receive an invitation from me, in fact - I will be responsible (well, rather, morally) for your adequacy in conducting discussions there. <br>  You can adhere to absolutely diametrical points of view on the subject under discussion, but please - carry a constructive and less trolling to each other.  Thank you in advance)) <br><br>  A personal request from MP Schlegel: if you criticize something, then offer your own version - they will all be carefully considered.  Then they will be consolidated and a decision will be made on their basis. <br><br>  From myself, I note - I think it will be stupid, if in the end it happens that we all discussed the draft law and dispersed and nothing has changed in it - this discredits the introduced public discussion platform.  So it seems to me that we have a chance to correct the new ‚Äúanti-piracy‚Äù bill jointly. <br>  Yes, ideally - it would be better if he did not exist.  But if there is an option to adjust it as best as possible for our requests - why not to do it? <br>  Let's try to rebuild it in such a way that we would then say: ‚Äúwe did everything we could‚Äù. <br>  Or leave everything at the mercy of the "lawmakers" themselves? <br><br>  PS The platform, <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/194114/">which was implemented by</a> <a href="http://geektimes.ru/users/shara/" class="user_link">shara</a> associates <b><a href="http://sociallist.su/">sociallist.su is</a></b> not going anywhere.  It will be useful to us both now and in the future, at least as a free alternative. <br>  In addition, there is an agreement that the initiator of the new "anti-piracy" law, MP Schlegel, will come to it, at least he promised to do it today. <br>  Perhaps it will serve us in the future as a good tool for making joint decisions. <br><br>  <b>Important UPD!</b> <br>  At the moment, a decision has been made in connection with the problems with authorization through the State Services - to make a free registration on this portal for all.  Also, authorization should work for all through the social network. <br>  According to the result of the introduction of discussions with such an open registration, a decision will be made about the possibility of such an approach to authorization or, nevertheless, the introduction of invitations. <br>  So for everyone - you can register for the "Veche" at the moment and without my invitation! <br><br>  <b>UPD 2</b> <br>  Throw me in a personal or <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/194978/">in the comments in this thread</a> your suggestions on the portal <b>" <a href="http://veche.duma.gov.ru/">Veche</a> "</b> : <br>  1) on the technical implementation of the portal: what does not suit, what suggestions will be transferred to the developer; <br>  2) the rules of discussion and decision-making on its outcome: let's think about how to put it together for all of us - and we are also ready to consider it - if there is our option in principle. <br>  There is a real opportunity to correct the mechanism of how the portal to form the order of consideration of opinions. <br>  So let's do it! <br><br>  By the way, <a href="http://sociallist.su/profile/Shlegel/created/comments/">here you can track</a> how MP Schlegel comments on the proposals under the law already on our portal. <br><br>  <b>UPD 3</b> <br>  <a href="http://geektimes.ru/users/muxx/" class="user_link">muxx</a> : <br><blockquote>  Earned entry to Veche through Gosuslugi </blockquote></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/194978/">https://habr.com/ru/post/194978/</a></p>
