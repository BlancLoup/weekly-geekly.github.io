I found that it gives me great pleasure to mess around with the system to remove the malware from there :) Gradually, I became interested in computer security, malware analysis and reverse engineering.  I began to study computer science as a second specialization (the first was archeology) and started looking for a job that would allow me to gain experience in IT.  Fortunately, the Polish office of LC is located in my city (Czestochowa).

      Therefore, I decided to first try to find a job there, no matter how inaccessible this place would look to a person who had barely completed his studies in the specialty ‚Äúarcheology‚Äù.  :) In March 2009, I applied for a technical support engineer position.  After an interview conducted in the form of a practical malware removal test, I was taken to a local office as an analyst for computer threats.  In June 2009, I took part in the Security Analyst Summit conference in Dubrovnik, and in January 2010, as a junior analyst of virus activity, I began working at the Global Research Office. <br><br>  <b>- What is your responsibility?</b>  <b>What is the essence of your work?</b> <br><br>  - So far, my work is related to the improvement of testing and strategic research.  One of my duties is also expert positioning, i.e.  Preparation of articles and presentations, as a rule, on the basis of previous studies.  My areas of interest include rootkits, malware for Linux and Unix, and malware for embedded platforms (mobile platforms, network devices, etc.).  Therefore, I try to prepare my projects and articles on this basis. <br><br>  In addition, working in the local office involves a number of additional responsibilities, since I have to provide support to all local units on issues related to malware and cyber threats.  For example, I help a technical support group deal with the most complex cases of computer infections, write reports and prepare other materials for public relations, talk about threats to partners and customers, speak at educational events, etc. <br><br>  In other words, the essence of my work lies in analyzing malware, researching information security issues and using the knowledge gained for various purposes. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/f60/caf/239/f60caf239e7313b6ac405bc311f81842.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  <b>- Please tell us about the most notable projects you have worked on.</b> <br><br>  - The largest project I have been working on (and still working as it is a permanent project) is the study of the security of devices for small networks (routers for home use and small businesses, modems, Wi-Fi access points, etc.) .  Based on this study, I wrote a great article for securelist.com (you can find it <a href="http://www.securelist.com/en/analysis/204792187/Heads_of_the_Hydra_Malware_for_Network_Devices">here</a> ) and gave a presentation at the Security Analyst Summit conference in Malaga (slides are available at this <a href="http://narod.ru/disk/43440804001.74400a41c8a2fae6bf52f378884fb5b9/Marta%2520Janus_MIPS%2520Under%2520AttackMalware%2520in%2520Network%2520Devices.pptx.html">address</a> ).  I am currently working on a prototype tool that checks the basic settings and firmware of the router in order to detect security vulnerabilities and informs users about how to fix these problems in order to better protect their devices. <br><br>  <b>- Is it difficult for you to work in a department consisting of practically only men?</b> <br><br>  - Complex issue :) <br><br>  In my opinion, it is a little harder for a woman to work in an industry dominated by men: especially to get through, to prove what you are capable of, and to gain the trust of colleagues.  But I think this is due to the fact that women have only recently started working in the field of high technologies.  In addition, women are usually less self-confident, and for others it sometimes looks like a lack of competence.  But, of course, I have never faced any discrimination.  I work with great people, and this is one of the biggest benefits of working at Kaspersky Lab. <br><br>  In addition, I consider myself a ‚Äúfemale geek‚Äù, so I enjoy working and spending time with other geeks, whether men or women.  The term ‚Äúgeek‚Äù did not appear by chance: it describes people who are united not only by technical interests, but often also by common hobbies, attitudes, tastes, and even a sense of humor.  It so happened that today 90% of all geeks are men.  Frankly, it makes life a little harder, but I think I can handle it :) <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/a93/74f/847/a9374f847451d647989ce5174cbffe26.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  <b>- What are you especially proud of in your life?</b> <br><br>  - It seems to me that this feeling of ‚Äúspecial pride‚Äù still awaits me somewhere in the future :) Of course, there are relatively minor events about which I think: ‚ÄúGreat, I did it all the same!‚Äù, But I always appear feeling that i could do better  I treat myself very strictly and critically. <br><br>  <b>- Finally, name the three most important things for you on your desktop.</b> <br><br>  - In addition to the three items that are absolutely necessary for work (monitor, keyboard and mouse), there is nothing special on my desk.  Probably, this is because I do not have much space, and I try to maintain order.  Although there are two things that are constantly on my desk: a box with pencils, pens, screwdrivers, etc., and an hourglass.  The purpose of the last item is not entirely clear :), perhaps it is just a reminder that time passes, life passes, as they say, memento mori ... <br><br>  In addition, you can usually find on my desktop a bottle of energy drink, a cup of hot Earl Gray tea and (sometimes) a sleeping cat :) <br><br>  <i><b>And taking this opportunity ...</b></i> <i><b><br></b></i>  <i><b>Dear girls geeks!</b></i>  <i><b>We hope you are here!</b></i>  <i><b>We congratulate you on the holiday of spring and wish you happiness, health and great success in finding the truth!</b></i> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/139579/">https://habr.com/ru/post/139579/</a></p>
