  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Nuances in the logic of the 3g PeopleNET operator</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  By the will of fate for quite a long time, I have to use the mobile Internet from peoplenet as the main stationary channel.  There was no alternative in my locality for a long time, and now they are only in the form of other 3g operators.  Strangely, I have no particular complaints about the work of this operator.  Even when connected, I built a hefty, frightening neighbors antenna and always had a very good signal level, and with it stability and speed.  But with the tariffs - there are some features.  As I use the Internet not one, even the largest tariff plan is not enough for me.  The first surprise is that the tariff plan is called ‚ÄúUnlimited New‚Äù.  But whether because of its novelty, or because of these very nuances in the logic of work - there are limits in it and for my volumes are tangible.  Limits end and further traffic is already significantly more expensive.  About the exhaustion of traffic, by the way, no one warns. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Relatively recently, in the self-service system (one name is what it costs!), It became possible to purchase the services ‚ÄúDay‚Äù, ‚ÄúNight‚Äù and ‚ÄúDay‚Äù.  Knocking on the chat and after waiting for the usual 10 minutes before connecting to the operator, I found out that they were unlimited packages for themselves, which act, respectively, during the day, at night and during the day.  Bearing in mind the peculiarities of logic, I once again asked about the limitlessness and the presence of limits in this very limitlessness.  You never know where they have very unlimited, and where not very.  Everything turned out to be true.  Unlimited turned out to be real, without fools. <br><br>  The first nuance in the work - to use these same packages, it is not enough just to pay for the service in the self-service system.  At the time of its operation, it is still necessary to log in to the network using other requisites.  Bredyatinka, of course, the average poshiba, but bredyatinka.  Who in their right mind would pay for traffic if they already bought an unlimited package?  Do they not know there that I have ‚Äúpaid off‚Äù and my traffic is not supposed to be charged?  Obviously, this was done either for reasons of economy - some of those who paid for the package do not use it, but will pay in full for charging, or because of the inability or unwillingness to do it normally.  In any case, neither one nor the other is obviously an excuse, and still leaves this decision completely nil.  Oh yeah, after use you have to switch back.  Also surprisingly convenient. <br><br>  The second caveat - the ‚Äúday‚Äù package starts at midnight.  As the package "Day".  And if I really want to start with the current day, despite the losses from their beginning, then this, alas, is impossible.  You have to be farsighted and prudent.  Conveniently?  Not.

      Another moment - if the foresight and foresight is present, you may want to go in once, buy it and then use it for the rest of the month for your pleasure.  But Wishka this again mercilessly suppressed.  You can not buy a few packages in advance. <br><br>  But the most interesting thing is that even if I agree to enter the self-service system every day, buy a package for tomorrow, then switch the connection to another login / password, in general, this is how I am dodgy and really want to pay them money, then here it turned out not all smooth.  It turned out that it was simply impossible to buy two packages of a ‚ÄúDay‚Äù package.  In the chat, when communicating with the support service, I was assured that it was impossible and the <b>days crossed</b> !  Those.  Today I have a ‚ÄúDay‚Äù package, and it is this that will not allow me to buy a ‚ÄúDay‚Äù package for tomorrow.  In some dimension unknown to me, they are superimposed and this problem has no solution.  In their universe. <br><br>  So, what we have in the end.  It was a great idea - to give an opportunity to those who want to swing a dagger for the evening - to pay money for it and download.  And in the implementation it turned out that: <br><br>  - Kinchik can be downloaded only tomorrow.  Today nothing.  Yesterday I had to think about today. <br>  - In order to use the service, it will be necessary to shamanize with a connection, go to the self-service system, the slightest step aside and your money cried. <br>  ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs impossible to buy peace of mind a few days in advance.‚Äù <br>  - Day, it turns out, overlap and every day to buy a package of "Day" - will not work.  For nefig. <br><br>  In this way, comrades from PeopleNET from their great idea were able to arrange a typical Kakul, which must also be used. <br>  Shl.  You can even make legends about the vyrviglaznaya feet made self-service system.  As, however, about the support service. <br><br>  <b>UPD</b> <br>  Forced to add topic legends about the self-service system.  Here I tried again to buy another ‚ÄúDay‚Äù package, after I had already bought the ‚ÄúDay‚Äù package.  And a lovely picture appeared before my eyes. <br><br> <a href="http://piccy.info/view3/2542199/d3bb8c04f340ef57f9a49d93fc4441aa/1200/"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/d90/82c/4e6/d9082c4e6257df45b75212954a0c2ae2.jpg" alt="image"></a> <br><br>  Now I know that PHP is used there.  So this kind of cramps can be done to me too.  I know that they do not know how to turn off error output and I know that they allow them :).  Well, the way some what ... little things, but nice.  Do not know just "how long" ??  :) <br><br>  <b>UPD2</b> Also managed to find out the version of php (impressive), it is still very similar that the whole thing was written in a not so distant (hesitated) 2003.  Well, even the little things.  Scary to watch.  It seems like a serious office, well, take it and make it once normal!  This is not so expensive! </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/137162/">https://habr.com/ru/post/137162/</a></p>
