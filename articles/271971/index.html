      Why do we do this?  It is quite obvious: not everyone who wishes can become a student of our projects, because only students from three Moscow universities can participate.  And thanks to online training, so many other talented students will be able to gain knowledge that is so useful for beginning IT specialists.  As part of the online courses, students will be able to watch content that is interesting to them and to carry out practical tasks for checking the learned material.  In addition, they will have the opportunity to communicate with each other, discuss tasks and ask questions online.  According to the results of successful completion of the course a certificate will be issued.  And now more about the available disciplines. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/64e/f64/051/64ef64051ff47463e53d2452c6daf5d5.png" align="left"><h1>  Algorithms and data structures </h1><br>  For learning, basic programming skills are required in one of the popular languages, for example, C or C ++.  The course contains a description of the basic algorithms and data structures.  First, the basic concepts and complexity assessment are given, which are analyzed using the following algorithms: ‚ÄúCalculating Fibonacci numbers‚Äù, ‚ÄúChecking the number for simplicity‚Äù, ‚ÄúFast exponentiation‚Äù.  Then the main algorithms on the array, linear and binary search in the array, the data structure ‚ÄúDynamic array‚Äù are discussed. <br><br>  The following module deals with the data structures ‚ÄúUnidirectional and bidirectional lists‚Äù, ‚ÄúQueue‚Äù, ‚ÄúStack‚Äù, ‚ÄúDec‚Äù, ‚ÄúBinary heap‚Äù, ‚ÄúPriority queue‚Äù, operations with them, methods of implementation.  Much attention is paid to sorting, two modules are devoted to them.  The main types of sorting, their implementation are considered, it is discussed in which cases it is recommended to use one or another sorting.  The topic of ordinal statistics is also discussed in this module as ideologically close.  After sorting, the task is to build an efficient container.  As a solution, various types of hash tables and binary search trees are parsed. <br><br>  Total for the course, you can score 100 points.  The certificate is issued for 85 points.  Certificate with honors - for 95 points. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/880/dc2/833/880dc2833587b66ca71641cea8f7b8c5.png" align="left"><h1>  C / C ++ Programming Preparatory Program </h1><br>  The course is dedicated to the study and implementation of the basic principles of object-oriented and generalized programming in C ++.  The following topics will be covered: <br><ul><li>  basics of working with memory in C programs, </li><li>  implementation of data structures in C, </li><li>  C ++ object model, </li><li>  special encapsulation issues </li><li>  special questions of inheritance and polymorphism, </li><li>  class as scope, overload, </li><li>  modular programming </li><li>  class templates and methods </li><li>  exception handling </li><li>  standard template library STL. </li></ul><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/b92/ced/ba6/b92cedba670bb70e67ac88e815c71f37.png" align="left"><h1>  Multi-threaded C / C ++ programming </h1><br>  To complete the training, you need knowledge of C / C ++ and the ability to handle Unix-like operating systems. Before the course you are offered to take a diagnostic exam, which is not evaluated, but allows you to understand how ready you are to go further.  The course consists of seven two-week training modules: <br><br><ol><li>  Containers.  Smart pointers.  Allocators. </li><li>  Berkeley Sockets.  Multiplexing. </li><li>  Asynchronous work with the network. </li><li>  Processes.  Channels.  Signals. </li><li>  Message queues.  Semaphores  Common memory. </li><li>  Streams.  Synchronization Tools. </li><li>  Parallel programming </li></ol><br>  Each module is estimated at 100 points.  In addition, there is a final "exam", - your own project, - it is estimated at 300 points. <br><br>  To get a certificate, you need to dial 900. For a certificate with honors you need 1000. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/6f0/ea7/664/6f0ea7664ac3e073bc04d2ad78b56a10.png" align="left"><h1>  Hadoop.  System for processing large amounts of data </h1><br>  Requirements: <br><ul><li>  Knowledge of programming languages ‚Äã‚Äãis not mandatory, but very desirable. </li><li>  There are examples of programs in the course, and in practical tasks you need to be able to read and write code.  It uses Java and Python.  Deep knowledge of these languages ‚Äã‚Äãis not required, and there will be no problem if you only know C ++. </li><li>  You need to be familiar with Linux and be able to work on the command line. </li><li>  It is advisable to at least know a little English, because  In the course there are terms and inscriptions in English. </li></ul><br>  BigData, MapReduce, cloud computing, NoSQL.  All these concepts have become popular in recent years.  And they are all associated with distributed processing of large amounts of data.  Hadoop is one of the most popular opensource systems for processing large amounts of data.  The need for such systems is growing every year - more and more companies are faced with the problem of a growing amount of data. <br><br>  Facebook, Twitter, Yahoo !, Bing, Mail.Ru - this is not a complete list of companies that use Hadoop.  Many of them are actively involved in its development.  And it is no coincidence, because  It is large Internet companies that were the first to encounter the problem of processing large amounts of data: how to store them securely, how to process them, how to get quick access to change them.  Now Hadoop is used not only in Internet companies, but also in many other areas where there is a problem with the volume of data (economics, astronomy, biology, physics, etc.) <br><br>  Thanks to our course, you will learn modern methods of storing and processing large amounts of data on the example of the Hadoop system. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/d9e/955/2f3/d9e9552f3d67ffac66d70589300ecfbe.png" align="left"><h1>  Developing a web service in Java (part 1) </h1><br>  For learning, an understanding of object-oriented programming principles and experience in using them is required.  Experience in writing applications in object-oriented languages.  It is desirable to participate in industrial, scientific or academic developments. <br><br>  The course is based on the practical experience of developing servers for online games and lecturing experience in the Mail.Ru Technopark at Moscow State Technical University.  Bauman.  The author of the course tried to strike a balance between academic consistency and practical utility of the material.  The course consists of two parts, divided into 4 and 3 modules, respectively.  Each module understands one big topic: <br><br>  1.1.  Web server operation. <br>  1.2.  User Authorization <br>  1.3.  Work with databases. <br><br>  2.1.  Asynchronous interaction with the browser. <br>  2.2.  Testing and load. <br>  2.3.  Work with files. <br>  2.4.  Multithreading <br><br>  In addition, students are given the task of practical development of the application code that uses the material studied.  Successful completion of the course will give you: the basic principles of developing a web application in Java, an in-depth understanding of the topics of OOP and design covered in the course;  Allows you to create a package of applications that you can use in industrial development. <br><br>  <a href="https://it.mail.ru/eedu%3Futm_source%3DHabr%26utm_medium%3Dpost%26utm_campaign%3DAnnounce%2522">Registration</a> for training is carried out through the portal <a href="https://it.mail.ru/eedu%3Futm_source%3DHabr%26utm_medium%3Dpost%26utm_campaign%3DAnnounce%2522">IT.Mail.Ru.</a>  The first classes will begin very soon! </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/271971/">https://habr.com/ru/post/271971/</a></p>
