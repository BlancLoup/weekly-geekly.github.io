  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Parking and IT: without gloss and embellishment</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"> Moscow paid parking is a huge project designed to improve the life of the largest city in our country.  Everything is intertwined in it: social, economic and environmental factors.  Its good implementation could show how well-implemented IT projects change even the lives of people who do not use the Internet all the time for the better. <br><br>  Ilya Zaporozhets and Anatoly Dubtsov, who worked in the Moscow Administration of Moscow Parking Space (AMPP), which is responsible for Moscow parking, tells Ilya Zaporozhets and Anatoly Dubtsov how to work for an employee in a government structure.  Prior to AMPP, Ilya and Anatoly worked at Yandex.Money, Beeline (Zaporozhets) and in Maxim Nogotkov (Dubtsov) companies. <br><br>  At AMPP, Ilya Zaporozhets ( <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/users/lisoy/" class="user_link">lisoy</a> ) served as deputy general director, while Anatoly Dubtsov ( <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/users/fytocioniz/" class="user_link">fytocioniz</a> ) was the head of the department for the support and development of information systems.

And make it right, and not as usual. <br><br>  Anatoly Dubtsov: Yes, this is a really interesting task: to build a convenient public service.  This, which is not yet in Moscow. <br>  The leadership that existed at that time inspired confidence that a normal IT project could be built in the state structure. <br><br>  <b>Roem.ru:</b> Why from scratch?  There was nothing? <br><br>  Ilya: Yes, there was nothing and there was no competence in the organization <br><br>  Anatoly: All tasks for the organization were performed by external contractors (and some of them interacted with each other themselves and the customer did not understand this) <br><br>  <b>Roem.ru</b> : How was everything arranged? <br><br>  Anatoly: All the main functions on the choice of technologies and the construction of technological processes are assigned to the Department of Information Technologies of the City of Moscow (DIT).  There are also contractors for the supply of parking machines, which are charged with interacting with the DIT for the transfer of information.  There are card processing contractors in the parking meters.  Information interaction with them was carried out entirely by those who supplied parking meters.  They also assumed the functions of information transfer in the DIT.  Control over their interaction was very mediocre. <br>  To this are added contractors for a parking monitoring system.  Their interaction with the DIT is also not controlled. <br>  We needed to figure it out and establish control functions. <br><br>  Ilya: Indeed, there was actually no understanding about the developed systems.  About the relationship between them, I generally keep quiet <br><br>  <b>Roem.ru:</b> How did you set the task? <br><br>  Ilya: ‚ÄúCome and do everything.  And make it so that it is good. "  In fact, the scope of the tasks we have formed <br><br>  <b>Roem.ru:</b> Not bad.  What powers and resources did you get? <br><br>  Ilya: the powers were in fact unlimited - that is why I was appointed deputy general director.  And resources only in the form of wage rates. <br><br>  <b>Roem.ru:</b> Everything looks very smooth.  Did any problems arise? <br><br>  Ilya: There were - organizational structures with new employees claimed for a long time, which led to the fact that some of the guys worked for six weeks free <br><br>  <b>Roem.ru:</b> How is it? <br><br>  Ilya: And this is how people worked, but they were not yet formally enrolled in the staff. <br><br>  <b>Roem.ru:</b> What did the personnel department say about this? <br><br>  Ilya: repulsed from us by the fact that "the staffing table is under coordination with the parent organization."  Department of Transport of the city of Moscow. <br><br>  Anatoly: At the same time, the management said: ‚ÄúGet people quicker so that there is someone to work‚Äù <br><br>  <b>Roem.ru:</b> Why IT pros?  There are no problems with work?  Are the salaries good? <br><br>  Anatoly: Neither they nor we knew it would be like that.  However, when we understood the situation, we said that we would solve the shortages either with bonuses, or we would find more how to solve them.  For we hired them.  So this is our problem. <br>  We thought that if he didn‚Äôt decide on bonuses, then he would have to pay out of pocket.  This did not happen, fortunately: when the employees issued, we submitted a list for a one-time bonus, which was signed to us and people were paid money for all the time that they worked. <br>  Our salaries were at the level of the market.  Not the market of highly qualified specialists, but quite a middling. <br><br>  <b>Roem.ru:</b> If a person is not decorated, should he bring a laptop, a table and a chair with him?  And then attract people? <br><br>  Ilya: That's right, you need to bring a laptop table and chair with you.  Attracting people, like us, the opportunity to come to an empty place and do something worthwhile that people on the street will also appreciate <br><br>  <b>Roem.ru:</b> And how in such an atmosphere?  It turned out to create something? <br><br>  Ilya: Yes, it worked.  It is very important to trust the leadership and a kind of carte blanche that we had, so something turned out. <br>  After all, in principle, many people who fall into IT or near-task tasks in government structures are responsible.  They simply do not have enough competence to build something worthwhile. <br>  When we appeared - their life was greatly simplified.  And we had really good chances to get good service. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/550/c0b/3ab/550c0b3ab9ac1f6c8eed118d8ec0cacc.png"><br>  <i>Ilya Zaporozhets</i> <br><br>  <b>Roem.ru:</b> I understand correctly that you have fallen into a company with a huge amount of money, but where was all this outsourced?  If so, how did it happen that there was no one inside who would understand what works and how? <br><br>  Ilya: With money, everything is a bit more cunning.  Yes, enough money, but to spend it, to put it mildly, is not easy.  The state made the maximum in order to exclude corruption.  And this desire is understandable, but a side effect is that even with a dedicated budget, it is very difficult to spend this money. <br>  Long competitive procedures with an unpredictable result can negate all efforts <br><br>  Why did it happen that no one inside knew how everything works: yes, it turned out easily - specialized specialists (for parking lots) were recruited, and the fact that under all this a powerful enough IT base once had a thought and it seemed that everything was simple.  After all, someone else's work always seems very easy.  And only when you dip into the process, you understand that I was somewhat arrogant. <br><br>  We eventually built a whole department of three divisions.  Experience during this construction, except for problems with employment of employees, rather positive.  We were actually able to create a cohesive team that was ready to solve problems of any complexity. <br><br>  <b>Roem.ru:</b> Next? <br><br>  Ilya: The most interesting things started when the management changed, in fact, in one day, in the fall of 2013: they replaced the general director Igor Kuznetsov with Alexander Grivnyak (the <i>news <a href="http://www.m24.ru/articles/28494">was made public</a> on October 23rd</i> - Roem.ru) <br><br>  Immediately the development stopped.  Stupid, impracticable and conflicting tasks have appeared.  For example, the task is to equip all Wi-Fi parking machines (it‚Äôs not about the parking machine distributing Wi-Fi, but about processing operations not through the GSM module, as in all similar devices, but for the speed, the parking machine would connect to the Wi-Fi network, which also someone must distribute).  Immediately introduced strict control of arrival.  Started cleaning staff.  Moreover, people were fired not for their professional skills, but according to an unknown algorithm, which naturally led to an increase in some nervousness in the whole team. <br><br>  Tasks that descend from the department are also distributed according to an unknown algorithm.  The standard was the refusal to take any decisions in principle in order not to substitute one‚Äôs beloved, lack of competences and unwillingness to receive them. <br><br>  As a result, in less than two months of work before the change of management, we did more than during the rest of our work.  This is despite the fact that all employees were involved at 100 percent and actually worked for wear. <br><br>  Anatoly: The feeling of ‚Äúnot substituting one‚Äôs beloved‚Äù is, of course, at the level of feelings, but was perceived by everyone.  There was such an impression that all processes are specifically inhibited.  When it is possible to solve some problem, it is specifically shifted to someone else, additional coordination is required, only so <i>that</i> it is not solved <i>now</i> . <br><br>  <b>Roem.ru:</b> what was thus inhibited, what did we lose? <br><br>  Anatoly: For example, the display of free parking spaces.  The service was ready for a long time, the data was transmitted, but there are some sensors that do not work yet.  In order not to show some non-working sensors - the service is simply not running on the combat site, it is only on the test site. <br>  At the same time, parking with such sensors would not be displayed as non-working, just parking would be like now: with the number of places, but without occupied / free.  And the number of such parking lots compared to all mapped is very small, they were really units. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/1af/3a6/c34/1af3a6c343b10ee5899b176f375821f0.png"><br>  <i>The counter on Parking.mos.ru shows only the number of parkings, but not empty seats</i> <br><br>  <b>Roem.ru:</b> Have you tried to voice this to management? <br><br>  Anatoly: I will describe a typical conversation with the leadership on one more example.  Once the question was asked directly: ‚ÄúWe want to take on the solution of the problem now and solve it, or do we want to cover our ass?‚Äù  Answer: ‚ÄúOf course, we want to solve the problem and we go to that to solve it, but if we take it on ourselves now, then we will ask from us, and now, one way or another, there is someone to ask‚Äù <br><br>  This conversation was in the middle of December of the thirteenth year, after which we realized that most likely already everything, but did not give up hope.  But it was very sad to stop.  No wonder we came to any one CEO, not versed in technology, could ruin everything.  So we still thought.  We decided that after the holidays with new forces we will go to this wall.  But after the holidays the opinion has changed. <br><br>  <b>Roem.ru:</b> Why? <br><br>  Anatoly: The authorities saw that a conflict was brewing in our country and decided to prepare a replacement for us.  We have a ‚Äúadviser general for IT‚Äù who was sent to sit with us.  It was in the second half of December, but we were not very upset and talked with him directly.  It seems we got along with him. <br><br>  But after the New Year holidays, two things happened: <br>  First: we were decided to set a task, which is to some extent logical, if you look at it absolutely without understanding what is happening from an IT point of view, but if you look at it, it‚Äôs pretty meaningless. <br>  The second: this task was attempted by the ‚Äúadviser‚Äù to directly our employee, bypassing us.  The employee said that he would not accept the task.  Then the adviser threatened that he would directly put the general task. <br><br>  We understood the following for ourselves: it will not work out and we will still be squeezed out.  If before we tried to isolate employees at least from political intrigues, then now it will not work. <br>  In addition, we analyzed some instructions and realized that the adviser is now looking for new partners, and in the meantime we have to tell the old how everything is good and agree with them ‚Äúwait a little more‚Äù, do additional unpaid things and promise them that everything will be fine as we already have a good relationship. <br><br>  <b>Roem.ru:</b> And you did not believe that everything will be fine? <br><br>  Anatoly: in view of what I wrote, it is somehow difficult to believe that everything will end well.  Well, the fact that political intrigues are switching to employees was an important impetus to the understanding that it was impossible to continue this way. <br><br>  <b>Roem.ru:</b> The atmosphere is understandable.  Let's take a look at why some solutions were chosen.  For example, the case of the <a href="http://maxkatz.livejournal.com/111992.html">Cyprus offshore</a> , where money is paid for parking.  Why it was impossible to make all payments to Russian companies, why not include a commission in the cost of the service? <br><br>  Anatoly: But with specifics more difficult.  The fact is that the main part of IT solutions was the DIT of Moscow.  And there, on decisions, offshores, and so on, has its own history.  Our subdivision was just created in order to take over all the functions for the further support and development of AMPP information systems for themselves. <br><br>  I am not very eager to protect DIT, but the story of offshore companies is associated exclusively with the features of mobile commerce, because the money allocated for communication, according to our laws, cannot be used to pay for something else, therefore schemes for converting funds from operators' accounts into money - always uneasy.  This is a topic for another conversation (smiles). <br><br>  With the commission invested in the service, everything is also quite simple: the operator for the service is appointed by the payment operator, all the commissions are different.  And in order for the commission to be included in the cost of the service, you just need to give the amount of the commission of the company that transferred the money.  Thus, the budget will have to pay different rates to different operators, with all agree separately.  Conversations with all counterparties about the reduction of the commission are underway, but all have their own specifics.  When the commission reaches a certain minimum level for <i>all</i> market participants, it may be decided to subsidize it.  If the commission was hiding ‚Äúunder the hood‚Äù, it would be more difficult to negotiate on its reduction, since there are no people dissatisfied with it and payment operators can dictate their own rules.  In the meantime, the commission is outside - all users of the service see who and how much is trying to earn in the city parking lots.  In the parking meters, which belong to GKU AMPP, the commission is 0%, and, accordingly, the Moscow government does not have a goal to earn money on the commission. <br><br>  <b>Roem.ru:</b> What were your KPIs, how do they measure the efficiency of spending within government agencies? <br><br>  Anatoly: There are difficulties with spending efficiency.  As we said earlier, there is money, but you can only spend it on permitted articles and only through contests.  Therefore, the company that, in accordance with the requirements, offers the lowest price, will be the contractor.  It's hard to talk about efficiency here. <br><br>  In addition, everything is complicated, again, by DIT, since the money allocated initially for the construction of the information component of the parking space was transferred to them.  How they held competitions and whether they used all the funds, or were able to save money, knows DIT. <br><br>  In general, the company is new;  And here it was necessary to assemble a team of people who will adjust all the processes and make the company already high-quality and capable.  Only here began the development of clear KPIs and a set of people who can execute them.  We are not the only division.  The previous manual was engaged in bringing the launched project to international standards.  As a result, we appeared in the company. <br><br>  Until the summer of 2013, the main KPI was to launch to a large audience as soon as possible, test, collect feedback.  And then get ready to improve the product. <br><br>  <b>Roem.ru:</b> What advice would you give to colleagues who are in your or a similar situation when working in government agencies?  In which cases agree to work at all? <br><br>  Anatoly: Unfortunately, the situation with the change of the general director turned out to be very unexpected, and I can‚Äôt advise against this, but there are markers that it makes sense to pay attention to. <br><br>  First, do not agree to work with an unapproved staffing table and specifically your rate.  It is better to agree that you can give some small advice, including the job titles in the staffing table, but you should not go into the structure with unclear salary rates. <br><br>  Right away in the personnel department you need to find out: is there a bet?  Is it approved?  Is it planned to work in the near future?  Answers from the category: "We take you to another bet, now we will approve a new one and we will translate you" - a hint at the instability of the situation. <br><br>  Secondly, as we see in hindsight, a hint of a change in the gender was visible immediately after the approval of the staffing table, but we thought that the process of changing them would take half a year and we would know who is who, and everyone would work together.  It was clear that most likely the deputy is prophesied to the place of the previous General.  But what they put him there in a couple of weeks of work was a surprise. <br>  In general, working in an organization with an unapproved staff list is dangerous. <br><br>  Thirdly, you need to look at those with whom you will work, but it depends on the position you are going to.  Our specifics was that we needed to work with the CEO. <br><br>  At first it was obvious that the general director has a goal, that he wants to see specialists at work and will not argue with them in their professional field.  Although his position obliged him to understand technologies a little, albeit superficially, at the level of terms.  And the new CEO was different in that he didn‚Äôt understand the technology at all, but at the same time he thought that he knew better than us what to do.  This approach should be wary when choosing any organization (laughs) <br><br>  Fourthly, and here I am not afraid to repeat myself, I need to take very seriously the question of the goals that are set for you.  We had this goal: to build our own IT department, take all the functions from DIT and develop the product based on our understanding to the level of user frendly.  These goals were announced to us.  What is being offered to those who go to work instead of us - I do not understand. <br><br>  <i>The material is prepared by the editors of <a href="http://roem.ru/">Roem.ru</a> specifically for "Habrahabra"</i> <i><br></i>  <i>Read us <a href="http://roem.ru/rss/type/all">via RSS</a> and subscribe to our blog on Habr√©!</i> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/212645/">https://habr.com/ru/post/212645/</a></p>
