  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Write letters</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  What should a project manager be able to do?  Nothing special, everything is the same as all managers, speaking Russian, managers.  To be able to plan one‚Äôs own and others ‚Äôactivities, set priorities, anticipate and take risks into account. This is all, one way or another, is stipulated in various standards for project management. <br><br>  And he must be able to write.  And even better - love to write.  Articles, presentations, instructions and much more ... And letters!  If you have been ‚Äúpromoted‚Äù to PM from programmers, look at the scribbling, as the consolation given to you by God for the fact that you for a long time, maybe for the rest of your life, have parted with the source code and programming languages.  Let us take this work creatively, to love it in our interests.  I will reward, I assure. <br><br>  So, we will write the letter to the customer. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  We will write a letter to the customer.  We will inform him that a new release of the project has been released, that it is time to put this release, ask for clarification of the requirements and ask you to inform us about further plans.  Here is the text of the letter:

      <i>I inform you that in accordance with the work plan approved earlier on June 10, 2008, a new version of SYSTEM was released and installed on the demonstration site.</i>  <i>Please read the new functionality and give feedback.</i> <i><br></i>  <i>I ask you to assist in clarifying the requirements and assumptions set forth in Appendix No. 1 to this letter.</i> <i><br></i>  <i>I ask you to set the date for the next user training seminar.</i> <i><br></i>  <i>Please inform us about plans to further build information networks within your offices.</i>  <i>Such a merger of offices will be a powerful incentive for using SYSTEM in the field.</i> <i><br></i> <br>  Here is a letter composed.  Well, you like it?  Summed up what has been done, what questions, suggestions and expectations. <br>  The text is full of flaws.  Paragraphs are not related to each other, the need for each of ‚ÄúI Ask ...‚Äù is not justified anywhere, any paragraph can be interpreted differently.  And the words from the last paragraph about the ‚Äúpowerful incentive to use‚Äù can be shouted at rallies from the podium!  Rewrite! <br><br>  <i>I inform you that on June 10, 2008, in accordance with the Annex to the Terms of Reference, a new version of SYSTEM was released and installed on the demonstration site.</i>  <i>Please read the new functionality and give an opinion.</i> <i><br></i>  <i>Since the requirements of the Annex to the Technical Specification are taken into account, in connection with the release of the new version, it is advisable to inform users about the new features of the SYSTEM.</i>  <i>Please set the date for the next training seminar.</i> <i><br></i>  <i>Work on supporting the system continues.</i>  <i>I ask you to assist in clarifying the requirements and assumptions set forth in Appendix No. 1 to this letter.</i> <i><br></i>  <i>The implemented SYSTEM provides for the remote work of clients.</i>  <i>As part of the implementation, a local version was installed due to the lack of communication channels.</i>  <i>Please inform about the plans to integrate the customer‚Äôs offices into information networks.</i> <i><br></i> <br>  Already better, is not it?  Please note that in the first paragraph we ask you to give not a review, but a conclusion.  The conclusion is written for each item for which there is a change, recall the same thing is optional.  True, it is still not clear what the conclusion should be about.  The third and fourth paragraph remained ‚Äúfar-fetched.‚Äù  It is not clear why ‚Äúwork continues on the SYSTEM‚Äù and one can only guess why we need information ‚Äúon plans to integrate the customer‚Äôs offices into information networks‚Äù.  Rewrite for the third time. <br><br>  <i>I inform you that on June 10, 2008, in accordance with the Annex to the Terms of Reference, a new version of SYSTEM was released and installed on the demonstration site.</i>  <i>Please familiarize yourself with the new functionality of the SYSTEM and give an opinion on the possibility of its replication in users' workplaces.</i>  <i>I draw your attention to the fact that Appendix 2 to this letter contains a number of additional proposals and questions requiring your clarification.</i> <i><br></i>  <i>In connection with the release of the new version, please determine the date of the training seminar and inform the users about the planned event.</i> <i><br></i>  <i>I draw your attention that SYSTEM provides for remote work of users.</i>  <i>As part of the implementation, a local version was installed due to the lack of communication channels.</i>  <i>As the user's workstations connect to the Internet, it will be necessary to:</i> <i><br></i>  <i>1. Install a dedicated SYSTEM server.</i> <i><br></i>  <i>2. Replicate data from local user workstations into a single database.</i> <i><br></i>  <i>3. Configure the access rights of the SYSTEM users.</i> <i><br></i>  <i>In this regard, I ask you to inform in advance about the plans to integrate the customer‚Äôs offices into information networks for the prompt implementation of these works.</i> <i><br></i>  <i>Applications:</i> <i><br></i>  <i>1. List of requirements implemented in SYSTEM on 1 sheet</i> <i><br></i>  <i>2. The list of proposals for implementation in the SYSTEM on 1 sheet</i> <i><br></i> <br>  Such a letter can already be sent to our customer.  It adheres to the cause-and-effect relationships, justifies all the requests, specifies the needs specifically.  There is nothing superfluous in the text.  This letter allows its recipient to start work immediately, without questioning. <br>  Writing letters should not be underestimated.  Good text saves time, becomes the starting point for collaboration.  A letter, and especially a letter on paper, is an important witness to your activities.  It may be that with many of your partners you will communicate only in writing, and according to your texts they will judge your competence.  If you do not know how to write, you simply will not be respected, no matter what other merits.  In the end, a well-written text brings to its author the same satisfaction as a well-written program source code.  Therefore, gentlemen, project managers, try to love the work on documents.  Just keep yourself from grafomanstva. <br></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/51359/">https://habr.com/ru/post/51359/</a></p>
