Thanks, habr!</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  After writing a <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/startup/112073/">post about the history of the project,</a> 3 weeks have passed. <br>  During this time, we completely changed the design and made many adjustments to the functionality. <br>  <b>We already have 3505 users, 292 famous people and 8001 comments.</b> <br><br> <a href="http://nekto.me/"><img src="http://shaida.biz/habr/nekto_2.jpg" alt="image"></a> <br><br>  Below I want to tell you our success story, which would not be without you, dear habrovchane! <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h3>  About life before the official launch </h3>  Service lived 11 days in beta test mode. <br>  During this time about 150 users registered on it. <br>  They shared a link to Nekto.me on the social network VKontakte and received feedback from friends. <br>  My enthusiasm was not lost and I decided to write an article on Habr√©.

    <h3>  About habraeffekt </h3>  7,000 visitors passed from Habr in 3 days and this gave the project a good push. <br>  400 users from the habr registered on the project! <br>  We received a lot of useful tips from advanced IT people. <br>  Despite the initial skepticism, most habrauser project approved. <br><br><h3>  About success </h3>  About us <a href="http://echo.msk.ru/programs/echonet/746333-echo/">told by Echo.Moscow</a> .  About us wrote ruformator.ru, internetno.net and dp.ru <br>  In just three weeks, we had more than 3,500 real users. <br>  We have already left more than 8000 comments! <br>  The most important thing is that people share links to their page on social networks, blogs, forums, and now we <b>already get more than 1,500 clicks a day from such links</b> ! <br><br><h3>  About new features </h3>  - Now you can vote for comments and if the comment rating is below 5, it is hidden <br>  - Added a button for complaints.  It will appear next to the comment if you hover over it. <br>  - Added new sharing buttons and authorization via Facebook (with difficulty, by the way) <br>  - Now you can see a list of celebrities and users separately <br>  - Turned on the tag system (last time it was temporarily turned off due to habraeffekt) <br><br><h3>  Oh funny </h3>  After the appearance of the post on Habr√©, they quickly wrote about the service in two hours.  Just two posts. <br>  This led to hundreds of comments in the corporate style of Anon, but we managed. <br><br>  Also, on the page of Mark Zuckerberg, harakryatik appeared straight away :) <br>  Immediately it became clear the attitude of Habr to this person - very negative. <br>  Then I had to delete his profile, but today <a href="http://nekto.me/Mark_Tsukerberg">he is with us again</a> ! <br><br><h3>  ‚ÄúI don't need this project‚Äù </h3>  There were similar words in the comments to the previous article. <br>  They also rightly noted that many people can say the same thing about social networks. <br>  In the meantime, the number of questions on formspring.me has already exceeded one billion! <br><br>  My old friend tried to convince me for exactly an hour that it was not worth doing this project. <br>  Now, after a month and a half, he changed his mind and even participates in its design. <br><br>  I want to thank: <br>  - Anyone who believed in the project and made me finally convinced of its prospects <br>  - To journalists, who, despite the unfinished project, wrote articles about it <br>  - Sergey Bulin for unselfish and detailed bug reports about security issues <br>  - To those who wrote detailed comments via the feedback form <br><br><h3>  About future </h3>  As you understand, the appearance of our blog on Habr√© says that we are serious and believe that NektoMe will become popular.  Rather, we are just sure. <br><br>  There are many ideas for improving the project, but we will not make another social network out of it. <br>  The project should not compete with social networks, it should complement them. <br><br>  ToDo list clogged until the end of the month. <br>  We know about all the errors on the site. <br>  We fix as much as possible. <br><br>  We are not planning to monetize the project, but we have already decided on the monetization options. <br>  Investors are not looking.  We are not going to sell. <br><br>  I hope for the support of a respected community. <br>  Sincerely, Shaida Khidirov </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/112324/">https://habr.com/ru/post/112324/</a></p>
