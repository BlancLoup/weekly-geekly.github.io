  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Learn to speak</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  In the <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/study/81046/">previous article,</a> I wrote a few tips that I think can help ask the right questions.  Tips are universal and are also suitable for the person responsible, and for the teacher. <br><br>  However, there is a subtlety: let you formulate everything in your head very precisely, correctly picked up the words.  It remains to <b>say</b> .  And here that often lies the insidious enemy - our, as the oratory professionals say, speech apparatus. <br><br>  Admit it to yourself, just do not be cunning: have you ever had a case when some ‚Äúlohomanaager‚Äù from a school bench spoke dismissively of you as a fettered, inhospitable person or ‚Äúnerdie‚Äù on your mind?  Who is he?  What can he do - just grind his tongue ... Stop!

    <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  And who said that it is good to ‚Äúgrind your tongue‚Äù is evil?  The common myth of Soviet times, that a real specialist is of little consistency, rude and constrained. <br><br>  I feel hurt when a smart, educated and delicate person, a specialist speaks dismissively about others (as a rule, NOT specialists) only because he cruelly and not very clearly speaks.  Due to the specifics of my work (as well as seven years of playing in the amateur theater :)), I brazenly take the right to tell you a few little secrets.  Let's call them <b>secrets of oratorical skill</b> .  I hope that by mastering them you will be able not only to communicate with people more easily, but also to remove the fear of public speaking. <br><br>  What usually prevents? <br><br>  1. <b>Constraint</b> .  Very capacious word.  It accurately reflects the physical state in which the person is.  He is compressed.  Or clamped, if desired.  In the lungs there is little air, the lips are pursed, the mouth is reduced.  Try it yourself in front of the mirror to talk in this state.  You will understand what the interlocutors see and hear.  Need to clean up. <br><br>  2. <b>Pose</b> .  It draws up to 70% of the information.  Watch what position you are in when you speak.  Standard error - when talking, something (usually the hands, the tip of the girls' hair, the folder) is kept near the mouth.  This is a subconscious action.  Means some distrust and closeness.  I will not tell in detail about poses (open, closed, trusting, hostile) - there is a lot of literature on this subject, but I‚Äôll remind you: if you talk something (usually fists) it shrinks, twists into a knot (crossed arms / legs) - this posture subconsciously does not like the other person.  She closed-aggressive.  Clamps need to be removed <br><br>  3. <b>Pauses</b> .  Most people who do not speak constantly in public underestimate the most powerful means of attracting attention - pauses.  After all, all communication is essentially an attention management, isn't it?  In practice, the rule is a sustained pause stronger scream.  Do not hurry.  Pauses in conversation - evidence of thoughtfulness <br><br>  4. <b>Attention to the interlocutor</b> .  Common truth: first you need to listen to the person.  Can you listen?  A simple test: when you listen to your interlocutor, what kind of emotion do you feel towards him while you are silent?  And if you are silent for a long time? <br><br>  5. <b>Articulation</b> .  This clever word denotes the ability to control your speech apparatus - mouth, tongue, palate, pharynx (hussars - be silent! :)).  The lips and tongue are muscles that require training.  With insufficient training during a long conversation, the muscles will no longer be controlled and the conversation will turn into a mess.  At the most inopportune moment :) There are some simple exercises. <br><br>  It is useful to make them before going to the audience. <br>  - Lips bow - a wide smile.  5 repetitions, 10 repetitions <br>  - Lips with a bow and lead them in a circle in one and in the other direction. <br>  - Lips between teeth and ‚Äúbite‚Äù them <br><br>  Letter exercises: <br>  RLI-RLE-RLA-RLU-RLY-RLE-RLE-RLE <br>  LRI- <br>  BCHD‚Ä¶ <br>  PTKI -... <br><br>  Just do not freebie!  Speak loud and clear!  It is important.  Freebies in general when learning is not recommended.  Of course, if you want to learn something :) <br><br>  Try it.  You will be surprised how initially it is not easy! <br><br>  Well, finishing the first part is my favorite check for articulation: <br>  Speak out loud 10 times in a row in one rhythm. <br><br>  "ROYAL ORYOL" <br><br>  Who said the first time and never lost it - is the only one :) Or many and successfully perform in public :) <br><br>  Sergey Fedorov, instructor </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/81432/">https://habr.com/ru/post/81432/</a></p>
