  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Holy struggle with Mikhalkov and Acop</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  In general, there should have been a traditional first ‚Äúcorporate‚Äù post stating that we have been hosting for exactly 7 years, that our profile is servers, primarily in Europe and the USA, that working for Russian-speaking clients and being an international company, we consciously refuse from servers in Russia, and so on.  However, the <a href="http://lenta.ru/articles/2013/06/22/piracy/">news</a> last Friday makes talk about something else. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  In 2012, on the basis of a small but very serious Core Backbone data center, we opened our own CT &amp; T technical platform in the glorious Bavarian city of Nuremberg, and now we already have two server rooms filled in there, and our customers consume almost 30Gbit channels monthly.  At the same time, we watched as not the first signs of the attack of the legislators on the rights and freedoms of Russian citizens on the Internet and outside of it turn into predatory griffons.  To us (in Germany and in the Czech Republic, of which our company is a resident), we began to massively move first sites with cartoons for children, then adult gay sites, then music, film and video portals of all categories.

      Sites moved, and we received more and more claims of some semi-abnormal rights holders who did not provide any full documents, but threatening us, the Czech law-abiding IT-holding, by the Hamovnic court, the investigative committee and removing our site from Google‚Äôs issue (there it‚Äôs, of course , twisted his finger at his temple).  At some point, it was necessary to define our tactics of interaction with Russian Russian copyright holders, which are getting sick, and we agreed with our lawyers that we would respect the right of the copyright holder to complain to us about our client, but also the right of our client to act strictly according to the law (that is, to require an official request , and not to fulfill the requirements, supported only by threats) we will faithfully observe.  The realities of the Czech legislation are such that the hoster is not obliged to arrange bloody repressions to the client after seeing beautiful pieces of paper with seals from some legal entities of Russia, the Congo or even Mauritania.  With the American DMCA queries in the Czech Republic, by the way, it's not so fun, but for them we always had Sweden and Austria. <br><br>  Inquiries from inadequate clients requiring immediate access to the server for ‚Äúself-administration‚Äù and the client‚Äôs personal data must be communicated, we in the language of Yaroslav Hasek and Jaromir Jagr reported that the letter was delivered to the client in his personal court and if within 48 hours the client never wants to do anything wrong, we will wait for an official request in the language of the country in which we have the joy of working.  Of course, with the indispensable provision of a notarized translation of documents confirming the rights of the complainant to this intellectual property.  With an apostille.  Yes, the <a href="http://nkvd.pro/">site</a> is in Russian, but legally the department, it so happened, speaks only Czech.  As a result, for some half a year we, without violating any laws, taught a number of adequate Russian rightholders to respect us and our clients.  Strict adherence to the laws and the lack of unreasonable fear of threatening letters led to the fact that not file dumps and warez portals, which we avoid, but high-quality online libraries, good music resources and some of the most popular video portals partially or completely moved to us. . <br><br>  I would like to stipulate that in cases where we saw a violation of the rights of private individuals - developers of some software or authors of other intellectual property items, we turned off the troll_mode and, if there is confidence in the complainant, requested customers to promptly respond to the problem. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/184472/">https://habr.com/ru/post/184472/</a></p>
