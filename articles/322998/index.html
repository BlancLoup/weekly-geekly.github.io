  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Free ASP.NET Core Training Courses at the Microsoft Virtual Academy</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  As soon as Microsoft announced that .NET will become opensource and will be able to work not only on Windows, but also on other operating systems, which was very relevant in connection with the emerging trend of import substitution, switching to Linux, etc., I was interested in this project.  I began to look for information.  And in the Microsoft Virtual Academy I found the course ‚ÄúWhat's New with ASP.NET 5‚Äù.  But the project is still being developed.  Changes have been made.  Versions were not always compatible with each other.  And I decided to wait until the process stabilizes.  The final version will appear.  And, perhaps, corrections to the final version, as it often happens. <br><br>  As a result, instead of ASP.NET 5, .NET Core 1.0 and ASP.NET Core 1.0 appeared.  The existing ‚Äúfull‚Äù .NET framework was limited to Windows, and the .NET Core became cross-platform and aimed at working in the cloud.  I decided to go back to studying it and see what they can offer me now at Microsoft Virtual Academy. <br>  And that's what I found for myself. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  <a href="https://mva.microsoft.com/ru/training-courses/-aspnet-core-10-17179">Introduction to ASP.NET Core 1.0</a> <br><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Course Information</b> <div class="spoiler_text">  In this course, Alexander Wachtel and Dominic Doerner explain the basics of ASP.NET Core and consider how Core differs from previous versions.  Both theoretically and practically, starting with simple applications and software, they go through MVC, debugging and logging. <br></div></div><br>  The course is in Russian, but it is read by a German (more precisely, two).  It should be noted that the Russian language is quite good (of course, with an accent).  Although, in the examples you can see a lot of German words (especially in the first part of Ubuntu and Visual Studio Code in German - invigorates).  In the second part, the examples are already in the English version of Visual Studio.  In terms of course is not very big - about an hour.  Honestly, pretty boring.  Therefore, for those who have no problems with English, there is not much point in spending time on this course.  And immediately pay attention to the courses in English.

Build your first ASP.NET Core 1.0 course. <br></div></div><br>  In the course, Scot Hanselman, whom I often saw in the presentations of Microsoft, together with Maria Naggaga talked about how to create their first application on .NET Core 1.0, explains the basic principles of ASP.NET Core 1.0, tells about middleware (middleware) , MVC work and routing, form creation, journaling.  The conversation is conducted in a casual manner.  Many examples.  For me it was much more interesting than the course in Russian.  I prefer a lively dialogue than monotonous lecture.  Yes, and the volume of the course is more - the whole 4 hours. <br><br>  If the <a href="https://mva.microsoft.com/en-US/training-courses/introduction-to-aspnet-core-10-16841">Introduction to ASP.NET Core 1.0</a> turned out to be interesting and you want more, then you should pay attention to its logical continuation " <a href="https://mva.microsoft.com/en-US/training-courses/intermediate-aspnet-core-10-16964">Intermediate ASP.NET Core 1.0</a> " <br><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Course Information</b> <div class="spoiler_text">  Want a deeper dive into ASP.NET Core 1.0?

I will go to him if I can master the previous two.  Actually, for the sake of this course, I will study the previous ones, because my goal is to create cross-platform applications.  It will also be interesting to work with Docker images for .NET Core. <br><br>  Of course, these are not the only courses on NET Core 1.0 and ASP.NET Core 1.0.
