But now is the time to ask a question: have our relations with machines gone to a new level?  Maybe we are already more than just good friends? <br><br>  Next, Alexander lists the signs, the detection of which should push serious thoughts.  Perhaps even on the revaluation of values.

      1. You forget about basic physiological needs. <br><br>  Drinking, eating, redeeming, sleeping - agree that all this is nothing compared to the need to escape from the pursuit of the cops or the attack of monsters.  A gamer can play without getting up from his chair, but this does not mean that he is not busy with extreme matters. <br><br>  Unfortunately, the concept of extremism in our case should be understood literally, since the stories with the tragic outcome of gamers began to repeat more often.  South Korea is especially rich in them.  One of the inhabitants of this country fell and no longer rose after the game marathon, which lasted 10 days.  Another hardcore player didn‚Äôt even have two days of intensive game set.  The third one survived 86 hours, but his game ended in non-virtual death. <br><br>  Dr. Andrew Campbell, a specialist in cyber psychology at the University of Sydney, says that fatal cases are triggered by an overly long session at the flickering screen.  People who are prone to epilepsy are very sensitive to this kind of exposure - it affects them in this way. <br><br>  2. Collect funny accessories for your pets <br><br>  ‚ÄúThink before you decide to buy this lovely chair for your mobile phone,‚Äù Alexander says with such words about excessive fetishism with regard to your favorite devices.  According to his conclusions and some scientific calculations, such purchases are in some sense a reaction to the replacement of fatherly love in people who have no children. <br><br>  3. Check your email on Sunday <br><br>  Checking the e-mail box at the weekend for many is quite a familiar procedure.  But, apparently, in this simple deed it is better to observe certain caution. <br><br>  So, if you wake up in the middle of the night to check your email, this is cause for alarm.  Quite a pathology, when you try to get into the mailbox during the execution of marital duties.  So, one American girl has gone endlessly far in her longing for the ‚Äúdeliver mail‚Äù button.  The girl's story is sad: her husband's nerves could not resist her attempts to combine sex with email communication, and he divorced her. <br><br>  4. Calling friends by nicknames, not by real names. <br><br>  Your friend may call himself the Devil's Horse or Cinderella - it does not matter.  It is important that you prefer to call him by nickname, and you yourself respond to an even more intricate name. <br><br>  ‚ÄúThis is the problem of avoiding reality,‚Äù says Dr. Campbell.  Modern people who have not acquired sufficient socialization skills, for the most part, are looking for and finding an outlet in virtual worlds, where they enter through the game.  This problem is typical for Japan and Korea, countries with strict public ethics: computer games are the only thing where children and teenagers are ‚Äúsaved‚Äù.  It is not surprising that these people, growing up, avoid face-to-face contact, preferring to find happiness in gloomy computer rooms. <br><br>  5. The ‚Äúding‚Äù sound has become your favorite tune. <br><br>  Some choose a ringtone on their mobile phone their favorite tunes.  Others - the melody of a call from the standard base, and then surprisingly discover that these sounds are the most precious to their heart. <br><br>  ‚ÄúIf you find the sounds of starting a computer soothing, and the signal of the arrival of new messages brings relief to the heart - this is a reason to doubt the harmlessness of the devices around you,‚Äù the author warns.  ‚ÄúTake a closer look at them, perhaps the danger is somewhere nearby.‚Äù <br><br>  6. You stopped laughing, you say "lol" <br><br>  ‚ÄúWell, well,‚Äù Alexander Garriet surrenders, ‚ÄúLOL‚Äù is fast.  Speaking a word requires less energy.  Moreover, Dr. Campbell himself explains that the emotional transmission with words-abbreviations and smiles was originally needed to minimize SMS-messages. ‚Äù <br>  True, at the same time Campbell stipulates that "this is only a theory, but sometimes I believe that minimization occurs already subconsciously" ... <br><br>  7. Answer calls when "well, very busy." <br><br>  First, the author commemorates Paris Hilton with an unkind word, a lover of filming scenes of her private life.  Then he explains that thanks to Paris, millions of people now do not consider it disgraceful to talk on a mobile phone while having sex.  In a sense, this behavior is already the norm, the order of things. <br><br>  8. Change the clothes of the device depending on your mood. <br><br>  Your mobile phone has a whole "wardrobe" of interchangeable panels?  And do you constantly change the ‚Äúskins‚Äù of the interfaces on your favorite devices?  - Be careful;  perhaps you should be colder with them, advises Alexander. <br><br>  9. Speak in a secret dialect <br><br>  It is easy to learn sectarian by speech.  Strange expressions, endowing with a special meaning of ordinary words ....  Therefore, more attentively: if, when answering the question about your age, you easily say that you still have enough RAM, you may already be in a ‚Äúsect‚Äù. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/4151/">https://habr.com/ru/post/4151/</a></p>
