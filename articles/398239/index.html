      <b>If you had a choice, use a computer with 8 GB of RAM and an SSD or a computer with 16 GB and a classic drive - what would you choose?</b> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/c7c/389/7de/c7c3897debfdda302fbb9e4fafd1995f.png" align="right">  Personally, my choice, of course, 8 GB + SSD.  In most toys, eight gigs is enough, and even a little software from everyday requires a large amount of memory at a time.  But the presence of an SSD for everyday and popular tasks for ordinary PC use will be much more affected.  And a quick launch of OS / Software, and a fairly fast swap, and just the overall level of performance will be higher.  However, the disk subsystem is often the slowest in the PC.  There is one more feature that is important - for example, in a month or two you are paid a premium, and you decide to buy some iron.  Delivering another 8 gigs of RAM is to unscrew the two screws, but changing the HDD to SSD is at least migrating the OS or reinstalling it.  And I would not like to spend time on it. <br><br>  <b>What do you think about the topic NVME?</b>  <b>Do people and ordinary users need this?</b> <br><br>  Everything is simple with NVME.  Yes, the speed of modern SSD is several times higher than that of HDDs, but even the fastest PCI-Express drives communicate with the rest of the hardware through an AHCI controller, which was originally created for the needs of classic HDDs.  Hence, the non-optimal operation of the protocols, a large set of ATA commands that are not very relevant for SSDs and a lot of ‚Äúintermediate links‚Äù between the processor command and the actual action in the depths of the disk.  In fact, NVME for SSD means approximately the same thing as moving the north bridge into modern processors at the time for PC architecture: direct access, improved compatibility with modern hardware, reduction in overhead costs. <br><br>  In the real needs of home computers, the coarse power of current generation SSDs is enough, and a simple user will get almost nothing from switching to NVME.  The fact is that operating systems simply do not know about the existence of such a way to communicate with the disk, and applications too.  So, they are to some extent optimized for the current protocols, and in order to get a real performance boost, you have to wait for the support of this protocol inside the OS at the kernel level and the corresponding sharpening from the software.  It takes some time. <br><br>  Now the only actual consumers of NVME are data centers and high-performance render farms, which even run into high-speed PCI-Express drives.  In general, of course, this is musthave-technology and its immediate future - and then, probably, some quantum computers will be relevant and all current opportunities will become dust on the side of the story. <br><br>  <b>New Intel systems still support DDR3: why and why?</b> <br><br>  Well, firstly, DDR3 has not yet exhausted its possibilities.  Yes, in a number of tasks, a DDR4-based system is significantly superior to a similar one on DDR3, but these are only very high-loaded systems based on the flagship Intel processors.  But there is a huge segment of consumer equipment.  The man had AMD and 8-16 gigs of RAM, he decided to upgrade.  There is no extra money, a basic i3 / i5 with a motherboard for the available memory is a great option to save.  The difference can be put on the already mentioned SSD, for example.  In this case, DDR4 will give a tangible difference in the price of the motherboard, and will require the purchase of the memory itself, and the performance will change significantly only if you use the video core built into the processor.  In general, DDR3 will be made and sold for another five years, so users who want to upgrade and do not have extra funds for a complete replacement of iron may well take advantage of DDR3 that are not critical for i3 / i5 memory speed, and the difference in games almost invisible. <br><br>  At the same time, if you are building a computer from scratch, it makes no sense to save on DDR3.  The price per gigabyte has already reached the same level (and in some cases DDR4 is also cheaper), and if you charge a motherboard with 4 connectors, there will also be room for upgrade.  DDR3 prices will not decline, but DDR4 may well double the volume at the same price in several years. <br><br><h2>  <font color="#cc0026">Vladimir Shevchenko</font> </h2><br>  Vladimir Shevchenko - HyperX Development Manager in Russia.  He is a great specialist in the field of semiconductor products, a family man and a lover of computer games who has found a new direction in his work. <br><br>  <b>Tell us how you got to Kingston and how you came to the periphery?</b> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/c55/319/530/c5531953029716d8d6589ec082d6c8ec.png" align="right">  I got to Kingston 2.5 years ago, and it was originally planned that I would work with classical semiconductor products.  In this area, I had a wealth of experience: in distribution and among other vendors.  But it so happened that at that moment, when I just joined the team, Kingston‚Äôs area of ‚Äã‚Äãinterests (and now HyperX) expanded and began to include gaming peripherals.  Well, today this direction has completely absorbed me, it takes 100% of my working time and I don‚Äôt take up any memory anymore. <br><br>  <b>What is happening with the periphery market in Russia?</b> <br><br>  Trends generally resemble those occurring in the whole world, with the only amendment that the appreciation of the currency made the price / quality ratio even more significant for buyers than before.  Our Revolver is good, but quite expensive, so we place special hopes on our new product - the <b>HyperX Stinger</b> , which should be available to a large number of players, incorporates the best features of gaming headsets and was designed with a rather aggressive use. <br><br>  <b>Do you play the games yourself?</b>  <b>In which?</b> <br><br>  I myself play, but time is not very much.  Work, family ... I prefer to rest in <b>World of Tanks</b> , if given the opportunity. <br><br>  <b>What do you think about carpets?</b>  <b>Many people think that carpets are simply not needed for modern mice.</b> <br><br>  The main purpose of the mouse carpet now is not only to provide high-quality tracking by the sensor, but also to set the correct behavior of the mouse itself: viscosity, sliding speed, acceleration and deceleration patterns.  Well, plus the carpet - this is what provides user comfort.  So today the carpet, maybe, is not so necessary for the sensor, but it is still needed by the user who wants to achieve uniform and predictable behavior from the mouse.  Our carpets are thick, large, comfortable and are the junction of the convenience of control carpets and the sensation of speed.  We use natural rubber in substrates, special knit weaving is all that the use of the mouse was enjoyable. <br><br>  <b>Many gamers and geeks believe that there is no stagnation in the PC peripherals market, no increase in quality, no price reduction is visible.</b>  <b>Why it happens?</b> <br><br>  It's simple.  Those who began to develop the market for gaming peripherals just sat on the throne.  Rest on your laurels is not the best solution if you are a market leader.  History knows many examples when such leaders, who are not keeping pace with market changes, were simply referred to the sidelines and they slowly died in consequence.  Remember the same Nokia or Siemens and their mobiles.  And where are they now?  We will be happy if old school gaming brands wake up from hibernation and will again offer interesting products with a good price-quality ratio.  Close competition is an excellent incentive to grow and move on.  In the meantime, HyperX confidently gaining its army of fans, offering reliable and convenient solutions at the most comfortable prices. <br><br>  <b>Tell us about the new headset HyperX Stinger.</b>  <b>Who is the main target audience?</b>  <b>How is it different from the existing solutions?</b>  <b>Will it create unnecessary internal competition among the brand?</b> <br><br>  <b>Stinger</b> is what should become mainstream.  The headset costs reasonable money and you are unlikely to find the best gaming device for the money.  Let's compare it with your favorite Cloud Core - yes, it gives a great sound, but you can neither adjust the volume nor turn off the microphone in one click.  In order for the headset to remain competitive in price, it had to be "stripped" to the ground: from the very beginning, the Cloud was not a cheap model at all.  So here is a complete set of ‚Äúcore‚Äù. <br><br>  Stinger was designed with the expectation of what would become a massive, affordable and popular product.  We took our best practices in the field of headset manufacturing and combined them in one product.  From Drone came an intuitive control system - on one cup the volume slider, and on the other - a microphone, to disable which you just need to lift it up.  From Cloud, we took the general concept: a reasonable balance of sound quality, accuracy of its positioning and volume.  From the flagship headset Cloud Revolver, the novelty received a microphone. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/e32/39c/66a/e3239c66ada7d5d5b490f4aa078368c1.png"><br><br>  At the same time, Stinger has a completely new case design, which was not found in our headsets.  Fully swivel cups, reliable, but lightweight headband ... In general, a lot of changes, but you read about them separately in the review.  The most important thing is that completely its own design and reasonable economy in production allowed Stinger to be 1000 rubles cheaper than Core. <br><br>  True, Core has its advantages - the sound is still more powerful and rich, a removable microphone seems more appropriate if you use the headset just like headphones when connected to mobile devices. <br>  I don‚Äôt really imagine how to use a headset with a folding microphone in the subway.  And the more massive closed-core design provides better noise isolation. <br><br>  Those.  we see that these headsets are different.  Surely, there will be disputes, but in the end - we give buyers a choice.  But the choice between HyperX and HyperX, that is, we still increase our chances of selling such an expansion of the range. <br><br>  <b>Buyers love clear model lines with clear price segmentation.</b>  <b>This is the entry-level, this is the ideal value for money, this is the premium.</b>  <b>Now HyperX has seven headsets, is it time to reduce their number?</b> <br><br>  Well, let's try to figure it out.  The most affordable headset in our model range is Cloud Drone, exclusively available on the DNS network for 3,990 rubles.  It is light and comfortable, has basic characteristics and is sharpened for gaming use.  She has a plastic, but rather reliable construction.  I have a personal example of its use: my middle son, who is 4.5 years old, has been ‚Äúchasing‚Äù her with a tablet since February - for more than six months now.  And where this couple sometimes just can not find, then under the bed, then in toys.  Actually, the tablet is already the second, the first one smashed the screen.  And the headset is alive and well.  And most importantly - yes, for 4000 rubles you can buy HyperX.  Not everyone is willing to spend more, not everyone has the opportunity.  With Cloud Drone, we are making HyperX more affordable. <br><br>  About Stinger I have already described in detail.  In the same CSN network, it costs almost 5000 rubles already - 1000 rubles more than Drone.  But at the same time, it is still more correctly attributed to the entry-level segment.  Simply, it is not so sharpened for tournament and multiplayer games, and, rather, is a more versatile solution. <br><br>  The average price range is occupied by our classic headsets.  Core, Cloud, Cloud II.  Do I need to talk about them?  Let me just say that between the Cloud and Cloud II is now located a new headset CloudX, exclusively available at Yulmart for 8490 rubles.  In fact, the same Cloud with a little work on correcting minor issues and rich bundling, we already wrote about it. <br><br>  Well, and the premium segment, our flagship is Cloud Revolver.  We have been selling this headset for half a year already and quite successfully.  Many users have appreciated its sound.  Yes, someone will say that the price is high, but I have not met a single person dissatisfied with the sound.  Revolver really has almost no competitors in terms of PC headsets.  More precisely, of course there is competition.  From the side of the bundle of studio headphones + a good external microphone.  But if you do not want to buy two devices instead of one. If you have a sound card with something of the Cirrus Logic 4398 level, you will be delighted.  The top audio chip perfectly reveals the top headset from HyperX.  Perfect match <br><br>  Thus, we see that although we have a great number of headsets, each has its own place on the market, its own audience and each of the headsets is trying to be a leader in terms of price and quality. <br><br><h2>  <font color="#cc0026">Mark liem</font> </h2><br><br>  Mark Lieme is the general manager of HyperX, vice president of marketing for Kingston Technology. <br><br>  <b>Now more and more users do not understand the hardware, they want the "best" and simply buy / order a ready-made computer.</b>  <b>Does it mean something to them the manufacturer of the filling?</b> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/668/de2/b6e/668de2b6e2af8734a48f59b5ec8caa4c.png" align="right">  Previously, to build a computer, you needed a reference book and a lot of knowledge.  Now everything is quite simple, and some users are so lazy that they simply buy ready-made computers.  However, on the case of your computer, there is often an Intel Inside sticker, some kind of ASUS logo from the motherboard, well ... yes, now HyperX stickers are becoming more and more common.  The younger generation of buyers already know about HyperX and trust the brand, while some have not even heard of Kingston.  So ... yes, geeks and so learn about our hardware, and ordinary consumers ... they pay attention to the logo, and we try to let them know that they have HyperX memory inside.  Because HyperX for many is a synonym for reliability and lack of problems with the warranty. <br><br>  <b>If you had only three words to describe each of the HyperX semiconductor product lines, what three words would it be?</b> <br><br>  Fury - value for money, Savage - products for PC enthusiasts, Predator - the best that you can buy. <br><br>  <b>Does HyperX have any clear periphery strategy, or do you just do what you like, and then look at the market response?</b> <br><br>  Our strategy is to withdraw one product, gain confidence, expand the line.  We had one headset - now four lines, from the most affordable to premium.  And today we introduced a new model in Russia: the HyperX Stinger.  It is easy, convenient, absorbed the best practices and our experience in building headsets, and most importantly - will be affordable, and most likely will be the best solution in this price segment.  The same strategy applies to other products. <br><br>  We did not have keyboards - we made one, then expanded the model range, adding the ability to select microswitches, soon (in 2017) a version with full-color programmable RGB backlighting will appear - the market wants it.  Now we are preparing another product - a gaming mouse.  We want it to become the same icon as the first gaming mice from other vendors, when every cyber spender or geek chose this option simply because it was the FIRST mouse in which they thought about his needs.  Today we want to release a mouse, about which we will talk "it took into account all the wishes and solved the popular problems known to users, and even for reasonable money." <br><br>  <b>You already have an entry-level headset Drone and a ‚Äúyounger version‚Äù of Cloud's with the Core prefix, why do you need a Stinger, how is it positioned?</b> <br><br>  Stinger is an entry level headset.  It should be understood that the Drone, for the most part, the headset is sharpened for eSports, and not for immersion in the gameplay with the head.  A Cloud Core is just a ‚Äúbare‚Äù package of a rather expensive Cloud line: high-quality, but not so convenient and more demanding to the audio section.  Stinger is a universal solution in terms of computer audio.  We have achieved an excellent balance between price and key features of our headsets: comfort, excellent sound and reliability. <br><br>  The speakers with a √ò50 mm diaphragm give a powerful and rich sound, the design is light, comfortable and reliable, the headset fits perfectly on the head and provides decent sound insulation.  We consider the Cloud Stringer the best on the market in its price range and we are very proud of our new product. <br><br>  <b>Why CherryMX Blue switches were chosen to launch the keyboard, because it is believed that they are not the best for games.</b> <br><br>  I understand why Blue is not popular with Russian enthusiasts: they are loud, you will not play at night.  :) At the same time, the sensations from microswitches are pure subjectivity.  When we developed HyperX Alloy FPS, we just went to the top teams in CS: GO and asked which option they would prefer.  With a noticeable advantage, the blue switches won - and here they are in the first keyboards.  At the same time, we know that some markets have special preferences in the field of mechanical keyboards, so as soon as possible we launched an extension for the Alloy line, making two popular options available: the fully Red line gaming switches and the Brown intermediate ones.  So in a month or two you will be able to choose exactly the option that is right for you. <br><br>  <b>Are there any plans to launch new lines, to conquer new market segments?</b> <br><br>  Plans for future products, I partially told in the strategy, and for now we want to develop PC peripherals.  Quality products have become scarce, there is competition, but it ... how to say.  The buyer has plenty to choose from, but he often does not want to make this choice, since he simply does not have it.  There is no product that would be bought because they are desired, and not because of the mountain of bad pieces of iron chosen was less bad than the rest.  The market is full, the market wants high-quality and well-thought-out solutions, and we will provide them.  Gamepad?  May be.  Joystick, steering wheel or something else?  It is not excluded.  Perhaps we will try to create a keyboard on a different type of switches - there are many manufacturers in the market, different in characteristics and price, or maybe we will develop something of our own.  It‚Äôs too early to talk about something like our own line of motherboards or laptops - we are not ready for this.  Let's see how the market will develop and where else users will want to see us. <br><br>  <b>Would you like to say something specifically for users of the largest Russian IT resource?</b> <br><br>  Yes, great idea.  I want users to remember that our products are inspired by them.  Those people who collect themselves high-performance or silent PC.  Those who know what is inside.  Those who love the PC with all my heart.  Without their support, without their informed choice in favor of the Kingston brand, there would not be HyperX at one time. <br><br>  When we create something new, we remember that we have users who expect the best from us.  Reliable and fast SSD-drives, capacious flash drives, high-quality DDR-memory, comfortable mice, keyboards, headsets.  Guys, we are trying for you, and the best feeling is to know that our work is in demand, that you choose HyperX and trust our experience.  Thanks you! <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/ab9/ad1/632/ab9ad1632e49d7f4deb88eb23dffe65c.png"><br><br>  That's all.  Stay with Kingston and Hyperx on GT!
