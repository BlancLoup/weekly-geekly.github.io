  <section class="page js-page"><h1>A few words about the publishing business "they have" and "we have"</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  I want to share the observation that I made yesterday morning in Helsinki.  There is such a network of R-KIOSKI stores in this city, where they sell magazines and some snacks and coffee.  In general, if we exclude the coffee and drink component, then this is a direct analogue of our First Band.  Helsinki also has these magazine and newspaper stores at every metro station.  However, yesterday I decided to be curious about Linux magazines.  Just recently, I, along with the editors of Russian Linux Format, rejoiced that the magazine managed to break through to the First Strip, and now the latest LXF numbers are being picked up like hot cakes.  It is all the more interesting to compare the situation with the somewhat provincial Helsinki, which is an order of magnitude smaller than St. Petersburg in terms of population, and in general, it is far from the European Union. <br>  We look into the R-KIOSKI pavilion and the first thing we see is that the magazines are not placed in the same cabinet, but in several separate cabinets or racks, depending on the subject.  IT and multimedia magazines are placed in a separate rack, on which we see the following: <a name="habracut"></a><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/133/1eb/53d/1331eb53df56eb65e27d1104c3e6e1ad.jpg" alt="image"><br>  Bottom left is the English Linux Format, the rest of the magazines I deliberately put forward.  These include Ubuntu user, Linux Journal, Linux User and Developer, and Linux Magazine.  That is, as many as 5 journals, not counting a dozen analogs for PC and Mac.  Magazines come from the UK and the USA and are distributed ‚Äúas is‚Äù, without reprinting to Finnish (the country is still small).  Prices are approximately in this range: 12-15 euro per room with a disk (however, there was no disk for Linux Journal, but it was still expensive).  Probably, in Helsinki you can find these magazines cheaper, since most likely R-KIOSKI makes a good mark-up (First Strip is also an expensive store).  Theoretically, in order to receive English-language journals in St. Petersburg, you can get an official subscription, but this is quite expensive in the end, especially if you take into account the cost of delivery.  Well, the delivery time.  Russian Post is now working unstable, in some places the sorters have inserted caps and parcels come quickly, in 1-2 weeks, but in other cases everything is sad. <br>  I looked through the magazines diagonally.  Linux Format and Ubuntu user are uniquely focused on noobs, 80% of articles are reviews of distributions and software, the rest is some analytics, some serious articles on programming, debugging, etc.  I did not like the Linux Journal.  The magazine is thin, and basically it chews on a boring topic for everyone: review and comparison of distributions.  As if in 10 years nothing has changed.  Linux User and Developer is a real find for those who not only picks their system, but also actively writes scripts, crutches, fixes bugs and maybe participates in open source projects.  Behind the holivar on duty Fedora vs.  Ubuntu comes with many articles specifically for developers, including Mono, c #, ruby, and other interesting things.  Linux Magazine - a thick solid magazine about everything, is aimed at all categories of users.  The style and level of complexity of the material - something in between CHIP and C'T, but at the same time richer: a lot of reviews, columns of editors, special reports. <br>  The magnificent printing design, common to all magazines, was striking.  The quality of both paper itself and printing on it is higher.  As far as I could understand, in the West they completely got off the offset and switched to digital printing on-demand.  I forgot to find out the circulation, but I suspect that he cannot characterize the penetration of the magazine in a country where there is no editorial staff.  That is, there is one large circulation of the English version, which then diverges around the world.  I wish she would ever get to us again :) </div>
