  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Internet marketing for a network of fitness centers: the realities of today</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  The market in IT is full of various ‚Äúprofessionals‚Äù in the field of Internet marketing, often with the inclusion of something absurd, such as ‚Äúcreating a landing page with a guarantee of conversion,‚Äù or ‚Äúsetting up a direct with a huge CTR‚Äù.  No one ponders the meaning of these words, and I think that their owner is an incredible heights of craftsman and practice.  I do not consider myself a craftsman.  Well, here to no.  It seems to me that I still need to study in this matter for a very long time, so I can only partially relate myself to the practices, which, from my own experience, understand that not everything is as easy as ‚Äúleads for nothing‚Äù and so on. <br><br>  I came to work for the company pretty quickly, and already at the interview I realized that the Head of Marketing Department, in principle, doesn‚Äôt understand anything about Internet marketing, because he started asking questions like, ‚ÄúWe would like to write SEO articles, can you?  Please send examples "... As it turned out, SEO articles were called articles that are" searched "in search engines for a specific request ... <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Which may not even be on the site ... When I came to the workplace, at first it became even a bit scary on how sovdepovsky was the approach to the Internet in this company.  And this, despite the fact that there was a whole cloud of side personnel, there was a fully staffed IT department (which, however, ‚Äúwas not responsible for the site‚Äù), but the analyst was not considered as a standard Internet funnel, but simply, frankly, it is not clear how. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/87d/260/7c6/87d2607c64ce4ba7bd06fc4d1add3cd9.jpg">

    <h3>  The scale of the tragedy </h3><br>  All the calls from the site and all the requests from him were added up (nothing was checked and subtracted, it just took shape), and a certain picture was obtained, which should be.  We should have 2500 applications.  OK!  KPI.  OK!  Well, go ahead! <br><br>  To begin with, the site on Bitrix was ‚Äúreflashed‚Äù by current developers in order to start using the program for distributing people to various clubs.  I was delighted, naively suggesting that we could send loyalty letters to clients of each club, work with the current audience and the audience of former clients.  It turned out that it was not there.  The API could only assume the transfer of a text application from the site to a particular club.  In any other case, the client could only call the hotline, and then the manager with the reception would distribute it.  By the way, the company led the service not only in Moscow, so the remarkable part of the calls failed ‚Äúto nowhere‚Äù, for this manager was the only one!  On 20 Moscow branches and the rest of Russia! <br><br>  Koltach decided to remove - someone guessed to put it before my arrival, and then decided not to spoil the phone numbers ... As a result, there were club numbers, a hotline number, and numbers of adjacent areas that we were not interested in.  Of course, as it is necessary API-shnoy program, which is now in every fitness club, one could only envy.  Of course, she could neither send sms to a client, nor transfer payments online to each specific club, she could not do anything at all.  It was developed in 1992, and, apparently, did not undergo regular changes, so it remained at the bottom of the level of ease of implementation - <a href="http://www.a2company.ru/">www.a2company.ru</a> . <br><br>  Of course, everyone is working according to the principle - ‚Äúwork - don't touch‚Äù, but here nobody wanted to change anything - this is understandable, to raise such a layer of work, this is not a joke to you!  And realizing that while it is useless to deal with this, I continued to delve into the "business processes".  She continued to rejoice at the current state of affairs: thanks to the site ‚Äúflashing‚Äù, it became almost impossible to work with technical SEO - divide regions into subdomains, or at least change the region title - everything was in one thing (the positioning module was never agreed).  Everything moved so messy that I was simply amazed, and I also thought: ‚ÄúWell, don't they really see that in SAMARA, FITNESS MOSCOW is written, and no one from Samara will, in principle, click there?‚Äù There was one way out: Direct and Google.  Fuh;  Well, I think, at least something figured out.  But it was not there!  There was a special ‚Äúsituation‚Äù with the director at all, - a tender was held in which they chose a contractor, but the price was not the result, but the average price per click.  That is, it didn‚Äôt give a damn how much advertising could be unscrewed per month - by 1,800,000 thousand, or 3,000,000 - ‚Äúeverything, as prescribed in the contract‚Äù - smiling, the company's commercial director, coming to the meeting, emphasized his importance. <br><br>  All right, for the time being we tolerate  We will try to increase conversions and to get all this at all. <br><br><h3>  Goal setting </h3><br>  The first goal is to increase the conversion without resorting to various changes in usability, without resorting to collecting applications from the landing page, without resorting to anything at all.  In desperation, I tried to turn on the colbekhunter and connect various sources of advertising (I‚Äôll tell you that neither the google adwords banner, nor the retargeting) that are close to the target audience still work there. <br><br>  The first tangible result brought me a Colbekhunter.  Nichrome people did not understand where to look for the cost of the subscription, asked questions and left requests.  It went with a bang.  BUT!  Of course, the applications came straight to me, and I processed the applications from the post office, then sending them to our receptionist.  But she immediately called the director with the message that I had connected some ‚Äúshaitansky‚Äù service, there were too many calls, some letters were received, she ‚Äúhad no time for anything‚Äù, so ‚Äúlet them immediately come to the club‚Äù and so Further. <br><br>  In a word, the connection of a colbekhanter became a <a href="http://www.artlebedev.ru/kovodstvo/sections/148/">unit of meaning</a> for this company.  We made it to the KPI with difficulty, and I began to prepare a new tender condition, in which the colbekhunter was also included. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/a72/bc4/5f8/a72bc45f8d4948548321f71cbab9eac8.jpg"><br><br>  The second action was an attempt to refine the site for the capabilities of a normal SEO.  The third stage was my personal creation of Internet workflows in bitrix24 - before that, all the work and reports were done in Excel. <br><br>  The fourth step was an attempt to set up conversions in the metric, because they were completely crookedly set up - as horrible, and, apparently, by anybody - there were different letters, different quotes, it was considered wrong and wrong ... There was a quiet horror.  Somehow I coped with it, and established, first of all, Google Analytics. <br><br>  In the fifth step, I tried to communicate with the guys who sent us two mailings for 70 thousand a month - I found out if they somehow shared the audience.  Of course, somehow they shared.  But precisely ‚Äúsomehow.‚Äù  I wanted to assign users a user ID, and then we would share it much more competently, but the management generally decided to opt out of email mailings, and therefore I myself conducted them on my own. <br><br>  The sixth act, I definitely had to expel a woman, 51 years old, who led social.  network.  Do not think that I am opposed to pensioners in fitness clubs who call themselves premium class, but the posts of the ‚ÄúFreken Bok‚Äù image format - It's time to lose weight - this is already too much.  A small example of the image to my post: <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/0a9/f8d/0a2/0a9f8d0a2d14480d80362748fdeccaa7.jpg"></div><br>  I tried my best to engage the audience: <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/e63/d0a/ad2/e63d0aad272c41dca5d0f6113b2f52e9.jpg"></div><br>  A small example of the image of her post: <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/9b2/9b9/bcf/9b29b9bcf1674c83914a5b0b13723883.jpg"></div><br>  So SMM also switched to me.  Yes, I forgot about SERM, because, apart from the incoming new customers, there were furious old ones, who quite deservedly complained about the disgusting attitude towards customers, and alas, it was so, despite the high cost of the subscription (average check) ... I had to work very hard, to "wash out" something like this: <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/1a9/011/d56/1a9011d5639d40d59d13317eb9d9d98f.jpg"></div><br>  There were many unrealistic tasks.  The landings offered by me, invented by the manager of the mobile application for which I was looking for a contractor, were connected.  I left work at 22 o'clock.  Sometimes she even cried, but still felt that my work REALLY was bearing fruit. <br><br>  Having dealt with all the catalogs, maps, banners, schedule of posts, placement of everything else, I tried to interview the contractor about the contextual campaign, looked at the quality of the application, etc. Definitely, the company was unmotivated, they just stupidly unscrewed the money.  And just digging into the depths of the campaigns, I found shoals that allowed me to spend the main amount of money without bringing in target customers.  Namely: they put ads, for example, on the name of some simulator, which was used in the machines too.  And looking for his machine, clicking a huge amount of real money.  In the main campaigns in the direct, I found up to 10 such "kosyachnyh" ads.  In addition, we have always had an insoluble conflict with payments.  They could issue an invoice only at the end of the month, our accounting department could only pay at the beginning of the new month, as a result of which I had an eternal ‚Äúdance‚Äù, because we tried to maintain our positions for each month. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/01e/939/cc2/01e939cc2ad44a678b62b66baa29f92c.jpg"></div><br><h3>  Failure </h3><br>  Failure with the keywords I was very strained, I already understood that we are merging the budget, but did not want to sit exactly and watch how this happens.  I was able to merge campaigns into my account, and while paying off with the previous company, I developed a new tender with a new KPI on requests (a colbekhunter was already included), and led all the campaigns on my own (see November).  Unfortunately, the development of my work was not long, because our leader was fired and put in his place a new woman who wanted to completely supervise everything, and even that which she understood poorly.  And that is why she offered to remove contextual advertising altogether and leave only ‚Äúfacebook‚Äù applications, and increase budgets there.  We are greatly squandered.  Very much.  The plate shows it.  In the new year we crawled out with the number of applications only thanks to the brand. <br><br>  And ... I left.  Unfortunately, I left this brainchild of mine, but still they don‚Äôt forget me, even a new employee calls and asks for help, my contractors call, partners call, they send gifts.  And this is probably the indicator of my work - the opportunity to demonstrate how it was before my arrival, how it all fixed and should work, and what we have now - landing pages, made on a free platform, cleaned up analytics ... But I‚Äôm I still see the results of my work.  And it is inspiring!  What a pity that it was not possible to realize everything that was so wanted. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/309684/">https://habr.com/ru/post/309684/</a></p>
