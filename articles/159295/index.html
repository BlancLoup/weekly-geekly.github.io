  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Pebble watch maker is not sure what Kickstarter will use for future projects</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Pebble smart watches became the champion in Kickstarter fundraising: their creators managed to attract more than 10 million dollars.  The device is synchronized with smartphones, allowing you to use their functionality on the watch itself.  In fact, this is a wrist computer, where you can read SMS, manage playlists in iTunes, receive notifications from social networks and count the number of kilometers traveled during a run. <br><br>  However, this project was not only the most successful in the history of Kickstarter, but also created a precedent, because of which the manifesto ‚ÄúKickstarter is not a store‚Äù appeared on the site.  In it, the founders of the crowdfunding platform ask users not to treat projects as products in a store.  The fact is that Pebble did not have time to fulfill its obligations to the backers in the agreed time, which provoked a storm of indignation and caused a wave of distrust towards the crowd projects in general. <br><br>  <b><a href="http://planeta.ru/top">Planeta.ru</a> contacted the creator of Pebble watches Eric Migikovsky (Eric Migicovsky) and asked him a few questions.</b>  <b>Eric answered succinctly and to the point.</b>

After that, I hired people and worked exclusively on design. <br>  - <b><i>Did you expect such success?</i></b>  <b><i>And with what you associate it?</i></b> <br>  - To be honest, we did not expect this: we originally planned to raise $ 100,000.  Probably we were lucky, and the combination of foresight, strategy and luck worked! <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  - <i><b>How do you evaluate your campaign now? What mistakes did you make that you would like to correct?</b></i> <br>  ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt say that we would like to change something drastically, but I‚Äôm sure I can say more when we start sending watches to our backers.‚Äù <br>  - <i><b>What should I first of all pay attention to during the crowdfunding campaign?</b></i> <br>  - On the product.  It is very important that what you offer is amazing.  The next step to success is to describe your idea as effectively as possible. <br>  - <i><b>What tips on conducting a crowdfunding campaign can you give?</b></i> <br>  - Paul Graham's quote will answer this question best: ‚ÄúDo what people want.‚Äù <br>  - Is <i><b>crowdfunding a financial model of the future or a temporary phenomenon?</b></i> <br>  - I don't know yet :) <br>  - <i><b>Is crowdfunding as an investment system relevant for all projects?</b></i> <br>  - Yes.  It creates a very strong social and viral effect. <br>  - <i><b>Do you plan to use crowd services for future projects?</b></i> <br>  - Not sure. <br>  - <i><b>You have collected a lot more money than you needed.</b></i>  <i><b>How do you spend it or have you spent it?</b></i> <br>  ‚ÄúWe have to produce 85,000 Pebble watches, and we spend all the money we collected on it.‚Äù <br>  - <b>How has your business changed after success at kickstarter?</b> <br>  - We have expanded.  Previously, we had three employees, and now - 11! </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/159295/">https://habr.com/ru/post/159295/</a></p>
