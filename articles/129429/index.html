      At the doctor‚Äôs appointment, 3/4 of the time is spent for the doctor to write about the appointment in his card.  This entry is often still impossible to read.  And I could simply dictate to a nurse who, being an experienced typist, would boldly type on the keyboard at a speed of 260 characters per minute.  This could also include a photo of the symptoms, for example, which this typist-nurse would have done right there.  I am sure that the time of admission would be reduced by at least 2 times, which means that the doctor could take 2 times more patients.  For private clinics, this is an increase in the effectiveness of investments in a doctor.  For the state - just 2 times less discontent and improvement of social indicators. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  After 3 years no one has to fill the keyboard anymore.  The doctor should just speak in a voice, his speech should be recognized and transformed into a text.  Speech recognition is not a secret to anyone, everyone already knows about Google voice search, the process has been running for a long time. <br><br>  Moreover, diseases and symptoms can be painted and standardized, and in the patient's map the symptoms will be marked with icons, not text, to improve perception.  Also: simply dictating the list of symptoms, the computer will offer the doctor possible options for diseases (the computer simply calculates them, based on the plates and links, which symptoms correspond to which diseases. Dr. House, thank you) and will suggest what other symptoms you need to check for availability.  The probability of medical error will decrease by several times. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/39e/980/b74/39e980b7478ca9c102146bf8c85f7a3b.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  All incomprehensible cases (not suitable under something known) will be added to a specific server, where they will be systematized under the necessary tags, and notifications will be sent to special diagnosticians about this and they will be able to give hints and analyze online.  Medicine will turn into mathematics :) <br><br>  But I ran a little ahead, back to what can be done right now.  Right now, the user will be able to watch his map online and the results of the analyzes that he passed yesterday, too.  You can store this card on your disk or in any online storage.  Official honey cards can be stored only in the state.  servers or on servers of clinics that have a license for it. <br><br>  Personal honey  A card that is online prompts the user in the form of letters or SMS when it is time to visit the dentist again.  If the diagnosis is not established or the treatment is not completed until the end, it reminds about it.  The online map analyzes your diseases according to predetermined algorithms, compares the period and type of the disease, makes up one chain of these links and issues recommendations, which doctor and for what reason you should visit and how critical it may be.  Before going to the doctor on her recommendation, she throws down the reasons for which the recommendation was made, all this can be sent to print in one file. <br><br>  Doctors in the offices are computers connected to the same network, they simply ask the patient for his ID in the system, then he enters the password on the spot or dictates it from the incoming SMS, and the doctor gets full access to his card right on the spot, no one with nothing to bathe like paper cards with a bunch of glued leaves. <br><br>  I was in GKB 24 in Moscow, there were all Mac mini doctors there, and there were no paper cards, although I was a little bit with leaves.  I asked them locally or is it some kind of global system.  They said that local.  I didn‚Äôt go into details then, but now, it would probably be interesting how and what. <br><br>  The fantasy ended at this place :) for myself, I can say that I‚Äôm now one of my clients, a private clinic, will help introduce an electronic database of patients and fasten electronic cards to it.  But everything moves much slower than we would like. <br><br>  Also for a long time I am going to do: get to my honey.  maps, scan and reprint everything, then arrange them by numbers and tags.  Type wanted to see when the last time the ENT was, you type in the search for the ENT, you get all the records about the ENT. <br><br>  If you have ideas and thoughts on this subject - share.  If you are already familiar with ready-made solutions on this topic, implemented or only with those that are preparing for implementation - also share, tell or give a link. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/129429/">https://habr.com/ru/post/129429/</a></p>
