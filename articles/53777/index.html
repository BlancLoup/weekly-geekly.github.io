  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Automate or attempt to find the impossible. Reflections on the past and present.</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Kuda do not spit, everyone uses some kind of accounting and accounting program, someone writes for themselves, someone tries to buy what others have written for themselves, someone tries to steal what they bought from those who wrote for themselves. <br>  As a result, we get confusion and vacillation. <br>  I have not seen a single program to put and work.  It is necessary to twist something, screw, rewrite, update, i.e.  participate in the process. <br>  What they sell is simply impossible to use. <br><br>  And we get something like this, almost one-sided dialogue between the program seller and automators: <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Look, what a beautiful program, what cool icons, buttons and fiches. <br>  This program is a miracle, it can do everything! <br>  What?  we don't have what you need? <br>  And we have a module! <br>  We will sell it to you! <br>  Want to? <br>  Only you need to rewrite it for you, but instead of addition, it calculates the integral of the square root of your revolutions. <br>  How much is? <br>  How much do you not mind? <br>  Nooo!  it's too small! <br>  It costs much more. <br>  Why so much? <br>  We need to feed the one programmer who wrote all this! <br>  Well, a person of 30 states of our office in addition, someone has to sell what he wrote.  And then somehow unsportsmanlike turns. <br>  Do you agree?  Super. <br>  And what iron do you have? <br>  What?  2-processor PIII 1.4 GHz with two memory gigs?  Are you laughing <br>  Yes, it probably thinks the first will slow down, but not our super program. <br>  We recommend you at least 2 4 processor servers with 4 GB of memory and gigabytes for 300-400. <br>  Why so much?  Well, of course! <br>  We put MSSQL to you, but does he know how he loves memory?  And you by the way have MSSQL? <br>  How is it not? <br>  And the Oracle is?  Also no?  Our program almost supports it, well, in the sense it will be necessary to correct the scripts for queries a bit. <br>  By the way, we can sell you Oracle or MSSQL, do you want? <br>  None of the stolen MSSQL will work, it will slow down wildly and in general, if you want to buy such a program like ours, won't you have another couple thousand dollars for a license for 5 users? <br>  And we will give you a discount of 10 dollars for a place if you buy it from us, we have Microsoft and Oracle in friends. <br>  You do not want?  Want to work on Unix? <br>  What is Unix?  Show? <br>  What?  Is this black screen Unix? <br>  And where is the mouse with the cursor? <br>  Oh, is this a server? <br>  And how to configure it without a mouse, our programmer does not know how.  Teach him? <br>  Do not you know how it works?  incoming administrator set up? <br>  Probably all the same, our super program will not be able to work on your black screen, look at what pictures and buttons we have. <br>  Well hands on? <br>  Why is it worth so much?  Well, how do you want? <br>  Our workplace costs 5% of the program cost! <br>  Why is it worth so much?  Well, we will need to customize and maintain every workplace, so it is expensive. <br>  And by the way, what is your technique? <br>  What?  PII and 128 MB of memory?  Are you crazy? <br>  Here you need at least P4 and 512 megabytes of memory and a 3D accelerator. <br>  why 3d accelerator?  What do you mean why?  and how our program will draw such cool buttons? <br>  Why such a processor and memory?  what do you mean why?  Our client part occupies 200 megabytes on a disk. <br>  and in memory, and even more. <br>  You do not have the technical capabilities?  And no money?  Why did we come to you then? <br>  show the program?  What program?  Oh, the program! <br>  Well, yes, exactly. <br>  Well, shall we go?  can?  will we call you later? <br><br>  The result of the conversation is basically one. <br>  In 90 percent of such negotiations, they end in nothing.

      And then begins the initiative. <br>  The manual comes to automators and says: <br>  ‚ÄúAnd let us write everything ourselves!  Will it be cheaper?  And closer to the heart! " <br>  What in 2 weeks will not write?  like this?  everything is so simple there! <br>  All you need is just the arrival, consumption of goods, invoicing of invoices and invoices, and of statistics. <br>  Is it so hard? <br><br>  Well then, let's start small, write something. <br>  Began to write. <br>  The time has passed ... <br><br>  Conversation: ‚ÄúWell, did our automators write some garbage, but let's see if anyone could write something similar?‚Äù <br><br>  History repeats itself indefinitely. <br>  Money is spent right and left, but not on business. <br>  Here is such a garbage! </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/53777/">https://habr.com/ru/post/53777/</a></p>
