This is my conviction, proven by time and practice.  No chaos control principles work unless they are put on strict cyclicality.  I would be glad to get acquainted with examples that refute this observation, but I have never met one of them. <br><br>  What do I mean by rhythm?  Developed in oneself the skill of remembering and returning to one or another topic or question after the same time.  The ‚Äúvagueness‚Äù of the work of the manager, the constant switching of tasks, the ‚Äúproblem-oriented‚Äù management is a vivid example when this principle is not observed. <br><br>  How to curb this chaos?

    <a name="habracut"></a>  We must force ourselves to tackle this or that issue exactly in time.  Set alarm clocks, set reminders - but according to some system, rather than randomly, and force yourself not to ignore them.  Aerobatics is the feeling of time to minutes - so that the internal ‚Äúalarm clock‚Äù will work on any time scale and do without reminders. <br><br>  For example, you can start the morning (week, month) by calling counterparties by the status of your projects.  If you could not reach us, we will write a letter.  This contributes greatly to the quality not only of yours, but also of their work: your partners will know that you remember them every morning (week, month), and then they should have news for you, preferably positive.  But when they are remembered chaotically - it is a headache for those who lead the project, and for those who carry it out. <br><br>  The world is not perfect, and it is unlikely that all your colleagues and partners, especially those that are higher than you in status, will have the same appointments ‚Äúfor you‚Äù.  Or at any time they can call you and report something very important that requires your attention "here and now."  May come ahtung letter.  Or do you suddenly remember that you forgot to do something very important in your time.  In general, like that morning janitor from a joke, knocking the whole of Paris from the rhythm, there are plenty of similar examples in our work.  How it seems to me to act in such cases?  First you need to try not to be the person on whom such calls and letters land, but to have a special employee ready to join the task and find out all the details on their own.  As for meetings, it is very useful to come up with any system for them, even if at first it will not be very slim, but that it will be a step.  In any case, chaos cannot be avoided, but those ten percent that can be put to the rhythm will return all the effort. <br><br>  Rhythm, as in music, has a structure - something determines its overall picture, and something - details.  Any chaos and unpredictability affect only minor points.  For example, a meeting can be held not in the morning, but in the evening, and globally it will not change anything (although it is necessary to try to avoid such situations).  Only something truly catastrophic should knock you off the ‚Äúlarge‚Äù rhythm. <br><br>  Cyclicity in time management has another advantage: ‚Äúuninteresting‚Äù, but the necessary things start to be performed, and resistance to them begins to disappear as soon as they have their own ‚Äúhome‚Äù in your schedule.  The principle ‚ÄúBecause it is necessary‚Äù begins to be implanted in your work as your own.  It really helps a lot in work. <br><br>  Tomorrow, you can already start with the fact that the "start alarms." </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/112883/">https://habr.com/ru/post/112883/</a></p>
