We are announcing <a href="http://corp.badoo.com/security">the ‚ÄúTest Badoo's Strength!‚Äù Competition</a> , which starts on March 19 and will last for exactly one month. <br><br>  Anyone can participate in the competition, except for Badoo employees.  Each participant can send any number of applications. <br>  Participants undertake to keep the found vulnerabilities in secret until Badoo reports on their correction in the application table, but not longer than May 31, 2013. <br>  <b>We pay for all new vulnerabilities found.</b> <br>  Vulnerabilities will be ranked from the 5th ( <b>500 pounds sterling</b> ) to the 1st category ( <b>50 pounds sterling</b> ) depending on their criticality.  The category of criticality is determined by the jury of the competition. <br><br>  In addition, we have a special prize!  According to the results of the competition, the 3 most active participants will receive ¬£ 1000 each.  If you find something very serious, then we can give out a super premium above 500 pounds. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h4>  Where to look for vulnerabilities: </h4><br>  <b>badoo.com</b> , <b>eu1.badoo.com</b> , <b>us1.badoo.com</b> and <b>corp.badoo.com</b> . <br>  The competition does not participate mobile versions of the site and applications for social networks. <br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/d5d/e7f/e3b/d5de7fe3bfbb20fbe3aa0f69bd7a0dd8.jpg" align="right"></a> <br><h4>  Prizes and categories </h4><br>  5 category - <b>500 pounds</b> ; <br>  4 category - <b>300 pounds</b> ; <br>  Category 3 - <b>150 pounds</b> ; <br>  2 category - <b>100 pounds</b> ; <br>  Category 1 - <b>50 pounds</b>

      We do not want to link our categories to traditional vulnerability assessment systems.  The more damage the found vulnerability can cause, the more valuable it is for us and the higher category we assign to it. <br><br><h4>  How we award categories </h4><br>  To make it easier, we want to orient you and tell you how categories will be assigned. <br><br><ul><li>  In our experience, most of the vulnerabilities that are found from the outside fall into the category of HTML or XSS injections.  If the found vulnerability cannot do any damage at all (for example, you can only change the output of the page), then it will receive the lowest 1st category. </li><li>  SQL injections are more dangerous.  Suppose you have found a vulnerability that ‚Äúbreaks‚Äù an SQL query, but the only result is only an incorrect display of content on the site.  Most likely, such a vulnerability will receive only the 2nd category. <br>  However, if an attacker can gain access to some data of one or several users with the help of a SQL vulnerability, this vulnerability can even get the 5th category. <br>  If using the vulnerability, you can update the data in the user profile, then depending on how critical the data is, we can assign higher categories, up to the 5th. </li><li>  CSRF vulnerabilities are also dangerous, but the category will be the higher, the more damage can be. </li></ul><br>  And do not forget that Badoo can give out a super premium above ¬£ 500 if you find something very serious. <br><br><h4>  We take care to </h4><br><ul><li>  participants received quick feedback; </li><li>  participants could track their applications and see which vulnerabilities have already been resolved; </li><li>  Approved bidders received a prize BEFORE the vulnerability is resolved; </li><li>  Payment of money was fast and without bureaucratic red tape. </li></ul><br><h4>  The process looks like this </h4><br><ul><li>  The participant sends the request through the form with a detailed description of the vulnerability, steps to reproduce and screenshots / files (optional).  The application must contain enough information to reproduce the vulnerability. </li><li>  If the form is filled in correctly, a message is displayed that everything is good and the report has flown to us. </li><li>  Within 3 working days we review the application and decide whether the new vulnerability has been found.  Following the results of the author comes the answer to the mail. </li><li>  If we accept an application, it appears in the table ‚ÄúStatus of applications‚Äù with the status ‚ÄúIn progress‚Äù. </li><li>  If your application has received the status ‚ÄúIn Process‚Äù, then our representative contacts you within a week and agrees to transfer the money.  This happens regardless of whether the vulnerability is fixed or not. </li><li>  When the vulnerability is fixed, the description of the vulnerability and the ‚ÄúResolved‚Äù status will appear in the table.  Up to this point the participant has no right to talk about the vulnerability. </li></ul><br><h4>  Join the game &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; </h4><br><br><h4>  Competition Jury </h4><br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/ba4/c97/5a6/ba4c975a6b372773345bd13afb3357ad.jpg" align="left"></a>  <b>Evgeny Sokolov</b> <br>  <b>Head of Badoo Development</b> <br><br>  In Badoo came in 2012.
