Apple has it for a long time, Panasonic has infected this idea, and now it came to Samsung.  Koreans gathered all their partners at once, called journalists and took the whole crowd to the capital of Hungary, where they showed a Samsung 9 series laptop and a netbook tablet (a ‚Äúslider tablet‚Äù - in the company's terminology) 7 series. <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  In Las Vegas, at the exhibition CES 2011, I remember, they brought not serial samples of these devices.  The laptop was forbidden to be videotaped, and the netbook tablet was completely fenced off from visitors by a blue ribbon, and it was held in hands with a big creak.

      Two months later, at an event in Budapest, Koreans showed serial versions of products.  The netbook-tablet now opens and closes clearly, all suspicious sounds disappeared, and the thinnest Samsung notebook has become less glossy, which is good news.  In addition, another novelty was noticed and studied at the conference: a gaming 3D laptop. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/CMPB-OZnaYE%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700021,15700186,15700190,15700253,15700256,15700259&amp;usg=ALkJrhi6ztnYu9gskMfh1BLRzlYSEOx7pQ" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br>  <i>A company representative spoke in some detail about the new models.</i> <br><br><h4>  Samsung 9 series </h4><br>  In Las Vegas, Samsung showed two models of laptops from the 9th line: 11.6- and 13-inch, but brought only the second to Budapest - so far, apparently, they decided to focus on it. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/8d3/d9a/2a3/8d3d9a2a3ea63c4248c47d3688f59d4a.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  The main feature of the laptop is of course the case.  The 13.3-inch 9 series is the first real competitor to the new MacBook Air.  Korean laptop is made of aluminum (twice as strong as usual), weighs 1.31 kg and is only 16 mm thick.  Samsung says that today it is "the thinnest and lightest 13-inch laptop." <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/f1f/5d2/3ce/f1f5d23ce86a4a73c6a46cd8a92c84df.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Special attention deserves the stuffing, which in 9 series is very, very stupid: Core i5 / i7 processors, 128/256 gigabyte SSDs, up to 8 GB of RAM. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/221/b3b/b4d/221b3bb4d05a6490b6fe76ddee2de44d.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  A set of connectors for a laptop is a bit non-standard: one USB 2.0 and 3.0 connectors, miniHDMI, a slot for microSD cards and a connector for connecting a network adapter or VGA port via adapters.  These adapters, it is promised, will be supplied in the kit, as well as a separate DVD-drive, stylized as a laptop.  But who is using optical media now? .. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/e96/e87/39b/e96e8739bf5b0a6641341f1569b2ca5e.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Dislpey called SuperBright Plus.  Displays 16 million colors and using the built-in light sensors selects the desired brightness level.  It‚Äôs the same with the keyboard: as soon as the laptop notices that it‚Äôs dark around, it will turn on the key illumination. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/47f/dff/fbe/47fdfffbe469741328bd04f37fc41275.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  The battery in the 9 series lithium-polymer and promised that the laptop will work offline up to three times more than conventional laptops.  Well, wait and see ... <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/eaa/56a/8c9/eaa56a8c94fd0ad2997da27d44c68ff8.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  In Russia, the laptop will go on sale at the end of March and in the most top of the range will cost 60 thousand rubles. <br><br><h4>  Samsung 7 series </h4><br>  At an event in Budapest, it suddenly turned out that the slider tablet (in English, the name of the gadget sounds like Sliding PC 7) will not be sold with a nice blue keyboard.  The Koreans said that the blue color of many is annoying, so they had to repaint the keys in a proven black. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/432/516/a2e/432516a2e2e0b506889958dd7abf0b7a.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Sliding PC 7, which in early January was not allowed to hold in the hands, because it worked completely unpredictable, is now refined from all sides and ready to start competing with Asus Eee Slider and Dell Inspiron Duo. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/de6/d34/55a/de6d3455a193a753f3d05216fa72bbdb.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  The processor in the Sliding PC 7, though the Intel Atom, but the second generation is the Z670 (1.66 GHz), the Oak Trail platform.  Hard disk - unexpectedly - solid-state, 32 or 64 gigabytes, depending on the configuration.  The amount of RAM - two gigabytes.  Connectors for microSD-card, USB / HDMI (via an adapter), volume control on the case and a webcam in stock.  The standard battery of the device, in theory, is enough for six hours of work, extended - nine. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/9e9/e3b/1ac/9e9e3b1acbabe5b1bcf2a2e58fb14c15.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  The display slider 10-inch, of course, touch and with a resolution of 1366 x 768 pixels.  It works under Windows 7 Professional (!), But in tablet mode, the user can use a proprietary shell with quick access to music, video, weather-time-compass, browser widgets, etc. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/23c/52e/758/23c52e758435e24dc0faa0249957bfc9.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Unlike the Asus Eee Slider, the Samsung netbook has a full 81-button keyboard and - more importantly - a touchpad instead of a trackpad. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/110/ad4/b00/110ad4b007a42a7329fff28d226cd2be.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  With the release time and netbook cost, everything is not accurate yet, but according to preliminary intelligence, the new product will be available in March and will cost no more than 20 thousand rubles. <br><br><h4>  Samsung RF712 </h4><br>  Well, how not to release a 3D laptop, knowing that competitors already have similar devices? <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/ddc/fbd/084/ddcfbd084aba847743acc91d2c36d76f.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  The 17-inch Samsung RF712 is not particularly remarkable in appearance (with the Acer 5745DG, by the way, the same story), but it‚Äôs crammed with good hardware.  Inside the laptop is a Core i7 processor, eight gigabytes of RAM, an AMD 6650 video card, two hard drives with a total capacity of 1.5 TB and a BluRay drive.  Other nice features include USB 3.0 connectors and SRS Premium 3D sound.  On the time of release of the laptop and its value is not yet known. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/114693/">https://habr.com/ru/post/114693/</a></p>
