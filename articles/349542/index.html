  <section class="page js-page"><h1>How to use gamification in analytics</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Any game assumes that it has a plot, character and actions that the character performs for the development of the plot.  Games are used everywhere in education from kindergarten to business games at work, all this is explained by the fact that this approach helps to easily and quickly learn the material.  But we all know that any BI-system aims to quickly and clearly convey to the end user a large amount of information, or so-called key performance indicators.  The concept of the game has long been used in analytics, only they call it all "storytelling."  How to apply it in real life situations?  Does the storytelling solve the current problems arising in the implementation of BI-systems? <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/en/2-/4k/en2-4k4crrr9qkqplqpz1akbsj8.jpeg"></div><br><a name="habracut"></a><h2>  What is the problem </h2><br>  If you believe the data from the free encyclopedia Wikipedia, the <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%259A%25D0%25BB%25D1%258E%25D1%2587%25D0%25B5%25D0%25B2%25D1%258B%25D0%25B5_%25D0%25BF%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BA%25D0%25B0%25D0%25B7%25D0%25B0%25D1%2582%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BB%25D0%25B8_%25D1%258D%25D1%2584%25D1%2584%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BA%25D1%2582%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B2%25D0%25BD%25D0%25BE%25D1%2581%25D1%2582%25D0%25B8">key performance indicators</a> are the company‚Äôs performance indicators, which help the organization achieve <b>strategic</b> and <b>tactical goals</b> .  But, it seems to me, these tools have long lost their purpose.  Let's try to ask ourselves: ‚ÄúWhy did we create KPIs?‚Äù KPIs were created in order to follow the changes and influence the result.  But instead, the indicators are our worst enemies.  Sometimes it starts to get the impression that not indicators work for the benefit of business efficiency, but the entire business works for indicators.  And we ourselves have a hand in this. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/wz/s5/y9/wzs5y9qgg-jwzyftb1u0s85ydww.jpeg"></div><br>  Each new data source, as it seemed to us, required monitoring - and we made a report.  New problem - new KPI.  We put all this into dashboards, assembled, like Frankenstein, from different departments that define the business in their own way.  Then systems formed from dashboards.  But these systems, like punchers, produced a large number of indicators without reflecting real business connections.  Every day in the system becomes tens and hundreds of times more data.  How are we going to control this?  More analysts?  More reports?  Quantity is not equal to quality.

      I have been a BI addict for eight years now.  In this article I will try to rethink the approach to analytics and tell how my team works.  How to learn to understand the behavior of the system?  Stop analyzing it in a disassembled state. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/tk/qq/un/tkqqunmszw5rhjc7zs5e8yossoa.png"></div><br><h2>  We are looking for a solution without tinsel </h2><br>  Any analytics should be built of three main components - <b>Data, Plot, Visualization</b> . <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/ng/-1/xr/ng-1xrnjqxpvp6hibfn1i6mew8q.jpeg"></div><br>  The data, designed in the plot, help you to easily delve into the context of the business and understand even the most specialized information.  Raw data does not allow us to track, for example, the optimization of financial flows.  Because <b>Data + Plot</b> is no longer just numbers, it is a digital reflection of business content. <br><br>  If you are still thinking about your dirty aggregates, then visualization will help you rethink this. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/5p/7t/p_/5p7tp_dji1bqobxkuhpav9_bzyo.jpeg"></div><br>  Here are nine specialties with the same average salary and their real visualization.  Learn more about how to get this visualization written <a href="https://www.autodeskresearch.com/publications/samestats">here</a> .  The power of combining <b>Visualization and Data</b> is the ability to identify the problem on real data at a glance - without an auxiliary KPI-tinsel. <br><br>  <b>Visualization + Story</b> is the third and most massive method that only a few have been able to skillfully apply in business.  Contextual visualization is intended to engage the subject area so that any user can immerse themselves in the report \ / example \ / history.  The same story can always be told badly. <br><br>  Netflix, HBO and other companies from the entertainment industry have long been exploiting this idea - they combine a beautiful picture and an exciting story.  After that, they collect data from each viewer and adapt to their sympathies.  Now it is the pioneers of analytics plot data visualization.  Thus, they get the most effective system management tool. <br><br><h2>  How we see the way out </h2><br>  What if your report could be adjusted depending on how long you were viewing the indicator, how often you sent it to your colleagues and what filters do you use in different situations? <br><br>  We abandoned piecewise analytics and came up with related analytics.  That it can fully reflect the business environment in the form in which it works every day.  Before that, we also made mistakes - stamped indicators.  Now, using <b>Data, Plot and Visualization,</b> we create analytical systems in which all elements are connected. <br><br>  The ability of an analytical application to explain a problem or a sphere with the help of process development elements of visualization can be called a <b>storytelling</b> . <br><br>  A single business process can be described, for example, by a chart and a set of reports, or it can be presented as an interactive tool that allows you to monitor connections and immediately get detail.  Everyone will choose their own way, but they can be compared. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/r5/pr/zk/r5przkzacj229d2ke0rqxz5uzpy.jpeg"></div><br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/ee/ij/vs/eeijvssnjz9upgxc5glvmpeedea.jpeg"></div><br><br>  Watch the video recording of how one of our demo applications works.  All data and indicators are fictional.  Any matches are random. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/fIFOHzEy1uo" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br>  Storytelling in analytics can give: <br><br><ul><li>  understanding of business processes at a glance </li><li>  the ability to explore scripts and create solutions in script format, </li><li>  cost savings (no wrong KPI, dozens of analysts to generate aimless reports!) </li></ul><br>  Before we started using this approach to analytics, we always tried to answer the following questions: <br><br><ul><li>  How much information are we able to perceive in the form of KPIs and tables? </li><li>  How many tables and indicators can fit on one report?  Do I need to post everything on one report or is it better to do several?  If new problems (indicators) arise, will it be necessary to make new reports?  Or is it better to modify the old ones? </li></ul><br>  Now such questions no longer arise.  When the data is arranged in the appropriate natural environment, you forget about such problems as a bad dream. <br><br>  In our hard work of creating BI-projects, we use a set of products collected under the brand new Russian brand IDVP.  IDVP.Data helps us to connect to the <b>Data</b> , to make calculations, to test hypotheses on the <b>Visualization</b> , to set the <b>Plot</b> , the interactive reporting module IDVP.Analytics helps us and, if necessary, to build an interactive 3D model (data movie) we use IDVP.Platform3D. <br><br><h2>  The plot as the key to understanding </h2><br>  An American engineer, a pioneer in the field of data visualization, as well as the director of the American Statistical Association, Willard Britan, 100 years ago, was trying to do what the technology did not allow. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/js/in/zt/jsinztcxbvumapvlb49er_cjmqw.jpeg"></div><br>  In the preface to the first edition of his book ‚ÄúGraphic representation of facts‚Äù (1914), he wrote: ‚ÄúMillions of dollars are spent annually on collecting facts in the deceptive hope that the collected facts will automatically lead to an improvement in the conditions being studied.  But we see that when it comes to the final result, no matter how valuable the exact data and real facts are, this or that way of depicting them is much more important.  Undoubtedly, the foundation of the building plays a huge role, but not the foundation, but the building built on it constitutes the goal of our aspirations.  As the building relates to the foundation, the proper way of displaying the facts relates to the facts themselves. ‚Äù <br><br>  Image and data can never immerse you in the understanding of business without a plot. <br><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Want to work with us?</b>  <b class="spoiler_title">We have jobs for analysts!</b> <div class="spoiler_text"><ul><li>  <a href="https://job.lanit.ru/vacancy/Pages/O-92-1.aspx%3Futm_source%3Dhabr%26utm_medium%3Dpost-2018-02-28%26utm_campaign%3Ddzm">Business Process Analyst</a> </li><li>  <a href="https://job.lanit.ru/vacancy/Pages/CD-01.aspx%3Futm_source%3Dhabr%26utm_medium%3Dpost-2018-02-28%26utm_campaign%3Ddzm">Data analyst</a> </li><li>  <a href="https://job.lanit.ru/vacancy/Pages/CH-87.aspx%3Futm_source%3Dhabr%26utm_medium%3Dpost-2018-02-28%26utm_campaign%3Ddzm">Lead analyst</a> </li><li>  <a href="https://job.lanit.ru/vacancy/Pages/CH-148.aspx%3Futm_source%3Dhabr%26utm_medium%3Dpost-2018-02-28%26utm_campaign%3Ddzm">Leading analyst (analytical systems)</a> </li><li>  <a href="https://job.lanit.ru/vacancy/Pages/CH-14.aspx%3Futm_source%3Dhabr%26utm_medium%3Dpost-2018-02-28%26utm_campaign%3Ddzm">Systems Analyst</a> </li><li>  <a href="https://job.lanit.ru/vacancy/Pages/CH-31.aspx%3Futm_source%3Dhabr%26utm_medium%3Dpost-2018-02-28%26utm_campaign%3Ddzm">BI System Analyst and Data Warehouses</a> </li><li>  <a href="https://job.lanit.ru/vacancy/Pages/BPM-30.aspx%3Futm_source%3Dhabr%26utm_medium%3Dpost-2018-02-28%26utm_campaign%3Ddzm">BPM Senior Analyst</a> </li></ul></div></div></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/349542/">https://habr.com/ru/post/349542/</a></p>
