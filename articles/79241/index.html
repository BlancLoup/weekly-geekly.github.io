  <section class="page js-page"><h1>MTS and IBA Finance: solve the problem</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  The problem described in <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/prava/78979/">this</a> post, began to solve and it makes me happy.  The question remains one - why it was impossible to immediately solve everything?  You pay money, but you don‚Äôt get service for them.  In total, 1.5 days were spent on resolving the problem (which was clearly not the fault of the client), until the post was written on Habr√©.  After (thanks again to the PR department of MTS) - the problem began to be solved.  The claims department was connected to the case and the debriefing began.  The error was on the part of the MTS, which transmitted incorrect data to the collection office.  If everything goes the way they say in the claims department, today at IBA Finance they have sent a notice that the problem has been settled.  I hope that it will be possible to get some kind of confirmation in order to make sure that I will be protected from the continuation of the clashes. <br><br>  Well, one question remains open - why in such cases in the offices of MTS clients can not help?  As I understand it, the claims department deals with such controversial issues.  Claims are considered about 20 days.  In the letter, IBA Finance was required to pay the ‚Äúdebt‚Äù within 3 days.  Disconnect is obtained.  It was possible to write a claim, which would be considered longer than the IBA Finance started a collection business.  The client becomes a hostage to circumstances. <br>  And here we must pay tribute - companies read large resources, surf the network, get acquainted with reviews.  It's a shame that only those who are responsible for the company's image deal with problems, and those who are responsible for the services do not have problems before clients. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  <b>Update final:</b> It all ended quite favorably.  No more calls, no letters.  The employee claims department, who was involved in solving the problem, took the coordinates, for every fireman, so to speak.  I, as already written above, in some confusion.  PR department and claims department thank you.  A huge minus to the employee of MTS, who made a mistake in the process of work, due to which incorrect data went to the collection office.  A huge minus to the MTS service offices and the entire first line of the subscriber department, since  In principle, they could not help them and refused to accept claims. </div>
