  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Who is who in the clouds, part 1</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"> After the outstanding story with Sidekick (which deserves a separate study), the topic of wool analytics about cloud computing has gone.  Among other things, a very recent Evans Data Corp report on this topic caught my eye.  What we liked - did a survey of developers.  We already more or less know the opinion of budget signatories, but it is always interesting to see the estimates from real people.  Well, apart from the obvious facts like the fact that Google is ours-all, some unexpected things came to light, like assessments that weighed to IBM for the clouds. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  <b>Who is who in the clouds</b> <br>  Developers Opinion on Cloud Computing Solution Providers <br><br>  Janel Garvin, Evans Data Corp <br><br>  Cloud computing is the current stage in the evolution of what used to be called web-based computing.  Most often, this approach is perceived as computing based on public web infrastructure, but now it also includes the concept of private clouds in which cloud computing is protected by a firewall.  The advantages of cloud computing, both public and private, are obvious and convincing: ample opportunities for virtualizing resources when needed, high availability and easier administration of software assets, as well as ‚Äúelastic‚Äù scaling. <br>  Given these advantages, it is not surprising that many of the leading IT providers today offer cloud computing services.  As is often the case, a wide selection can make it difficult to make decisions for CIO, CTO and ISV, which plan to use the cloud for developing or executing applications.

      We interviewed software developers familiar with cloud computing offerings, asking them to rate key vendors in this market.  Developers were asked to evaluate suppliers for a set of available capabilities in the field of cloud computing, as well as to evaluate the completeness of proposals and the ability of companies to implement a cloud computing strategy.  This report summarizes the estimates received from the developers and product managers. <br><br>  <b>Cloud Service Provider Positions</b> <br>  In fig.  1 key suppliers are located in the coordinate system in accordance with how developers perceive them in three main indicators.  The abscissa axis shows how highly developers estimate the vendor‚Äôs ability to implement a cloud computing strategy.  The ordinate axis contains the estimates of the completeness of the solutions.  Circular markers demonstrate the degree of mastering of the vendor‚Äôs decisions by customers, while the inner red circle shows the current number of insertions, and the outer black circle shows the number of implementations planned in the next 12 months. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/megamozg/post_images/93b/acd/cc9/93bacdcc96574221a82dc71e4caaea62.jpg" alt="image"><br>  Fig.  one <br><br>  As can be seen from fig.  1, developers are confident that Amazon and Google have the most complete solutions and the highest, according to the respondents, the ability to implement cloud services.  At the moment, these companies have approximately an equal number of cloud service users, but in the coming year, the developers intend to use Google more than Amazon. <br><br>  Note that there is a correlation between the number of implementations and the perception of completeness of solutions and the ability to perform.  Both Google and Amazon have brought public cloud computing services to the market quite a long time ago, so now these companies are the most well-known, and developers are more familiar with their services. <br><br>  The following three companies whose solutions are mastered by developers are IBM, Microsoft, and VMWare.  At the same time, Microsoft and VMWare have more current users, but IBM is not inferior to them in the number of implementations planned for the coming year.  In general, IBM is ahead of all other companies (with the exception of Google and Amazon) in its ability to implement a cloud computing strategy. <br><br>  Microsoft's Azure platform is considered by developers to be as complete as a competitor's offer, but Microsoft lags behind most of the ranked companies in terms of the ability to execute services.  Distrust of developers to implement from MS, perhaps due to the fact that the traditional business model of this company is in some contradiction with the concept of cloud computing.  Despite the fact that MS vigorously promotes Azure and quite successfully attracted developers to the development of early versions of this platform, the company still lags even behind Sun, HP and Citrix in terms of developer confidence.  However, MS has the most powerful and widest network of developers in the world, and it would be foolish to write off this company from accounts when evaluating the cloud computing market. <br><br>  In contrast to Microsoft, IBM, as follows from our survey, has been very successful in presenting its cloud computing concept to developers.  The corporation was able to convince developers of the power of its cloud solutions; this is clearly demonstrated by the very high marks IBM received for completeness of solutions and for the ability to implement services.  In addition, the surveyed developers are planning to more actively develop IBM solutions in the coming year, which indicates good prospects for the corporation in the field of cloud computing. <br><br>  The rest of the rating companies either work in narrow niches, or later enter the cloud computing market, or are better known as providers of other products and services.  In particular, AT &amp; T has never been a supplier of software platforms, but a year ago, Synaptic Hosting presented a fairly strong solution.  The service offers pay-as-you-go access to managed hosting, data storage and processing, security tools and network operations in accordance with the current needs of the customer.  In addition, a few months ago, the company offered the Storage as a Service service based on EMC technologies.  AT &amp; T's physical infrastructure provides the company with certain advantages in the long term, but for now it is new to the cloud computing market and software platforms in general. <br><br>  CA is very focused on private corporate clouds, especially large corporations.  This exceptional focus and weak appeal to the developers limits the community knowledge about the proposals and opportunities of the company.  Aptana is a company that offers services based on open source software, its cloud computing environment supports Ruby and PHP.  Cloud services were announced in early 2009, but the company is still little known.  Rackspace is better known for its server hosting than cloud computing, which now also offers.  Due to its hosting, Rackspace is well positioned to capture a certain share of the cloud computing market, but apparently the company has not yet been able to convey information about its proposals to developers. <br><br>  HP is too distanced from the developers, preferring to work through partners, which may serve as an explanation of its average position in the ranking.  Citrix, of course, is well known for its XEN-based products, but they are not necessarily used for cloud computing.  Sun, which has always worked very closely with the developers and enjoyed their respect, is now reaping the benefits of a merger with Oracle.  The inevitably associated market uncertainty reduces the estimates that the developers are giving today to Sun's proposals. <br><br>  <b>Public or private?</b> <br>  Although it all started with the Amazon offer - the EC2 public cloud environment, the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãprivate clouds has by now gained no less popularity.  Private clouds solve a number of serious problems against which public ones are not insured, namely, security problems, data confidentiality, waiting time, and also part of the problems of compliance with the requirements of state and industry regulators.  Although both public and private clouds are essentially software implementations of web-based infrastructure, usually with the ability to virtualize in a data center, public clouds offer storage based on ‚Äúmulti-tenancy‚Äù infrastructures, while private clouds are deployed and supported by corporations behind the firewall.  Companies with their own server fleet and IT department may find this privacy and reliable control more attractive than the lightweight box solutions offered by public cloud workers.  On the other hand, public clouds offer an easy and affordable way to deploy websites or business systems with large scaling capabilities that other solutions would not have available. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/megamozg/post_images/80f/9dc/58b/80f9dc58b2948cdb14e8c7079439696d.jpg" alt="image"><br>  Fig.  2 <br><br>  We asked developers about how they perceive vendors in terms of their belonging to the world of private or public clouds.  As a result, it became clear (see Figure 2) that only Amazon and Google are perceived as supporters of public clouds.  Despite the fact that most of the rated companies have at least declared their intention to offer both private and public clouds, developers continue to perceive them mainly as private cloud providers.  The exceptions are Microsoft and AT &amp; T, which are closer to the distribution median.  It is very likely that these two companies will move towards public clouds and compete with Google and Amazon. <br><br>  IBM and VMWare have the best position in the field of private clouds.  Google or Amazon are unlikely to break the market‚Äôs strongest perception as public collovers and move far enough into private clouds to compete with IBM and VMWare for large corporate cloud computing customers. <br><br>  <b>Cloud Solution Provider Strengths</b> <br>  SECURITY <br>  The biggest obstacle to deploying applications in the cloud is undoubtedly inadequate security.  The idea of ‚Äã‚Äãstoring confidential company or customer data and executing transactions on a virtualized ‚Äúpublic‚Äù server brings many CIOs to emetic urges.  In reality, the danger of losing or leaking data may not be as great as it seems to someone, but the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãremoving information from the control of the IT department is a stumbling block if data protection is of paramount value.  Accordingly, developers invariably put insufficient security in the first place in the ratings of obstacles to mastering cloud computing. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/megamozg/post_images/7bc/277/413/7bc2774134dc9cff8dc845dcce7a1df1.jpg" alt="image"><br>  Fig.  3 <br><br>  As can be seen in Figure 3, the developers consider IBM a company that provides the highest security for cloud computing.  The corporation offers a full-featured and working solution that developers already use for both creating and deploying applications.  IBM sells cloud services in its cloud computing environment and in the format of public clouds, but is perceived more as a provider of private clouds.  In both cases, the solid reputation that IBM has earned in various areas of computing undoubtedly affects the confident perception of the solutions offered to it as the safest of all. <br><br>  Original EDC text <a href="http://www.evansdata.com/research/market_alerts_start.php">here (registration required)</a> . <br>  If there is interest, I'll post the translation of the end (ratings of scalability, response, price / quality). </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/73564/">https://habr.com/ru/post/73564/</a></p>
