    <h4>  Shock Spin / Spin HD </h4><br>  Let's start with the white headphones from Tt eSPORTS, e-sports division Thermaltake.  Under the name Shock Spin HD model came out, which can be described as "universal." <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/a5d/316/234/a5d316234464d478b995a2e8258cb2b8.jpg"><br><br>  Headphones semi-closed type, attached to the headband - plastic brackets with a small degree of freedom.  The headband itself is unregulated, two-part. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/a7a/86c/31c/a7a86c31cab10db0be0272dc0c1d41d3.jpg"><br><br>  The upper arc plays the role of a connector and the main element holding the load / pressing the speakers themselves to the ears. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/c5d/f24/f4d/c5df24f4db8f34efc3f9c51f8ec0c88a.jpg"><br><br>  Made of durable-looking, high-quality white plastic.  The lower half of the headband - stabilizer and head support - is made of rubberized (or rubber) composition, fixed on a plastic base. <br><br>  The ‚Äústabilizer‚Äù bends well and stretches, does not press on the head, perfectly supports the speakers themselves at the ‚Äúright‚Äù level and generally behaves quietly and inconspicuously, there is not the slightest claim to this part. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/d17/09e/602/d1709e60255f5904db9401f264288b5d.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/7fb/4e1/9ca/7fb4e19caf41acb940a6a4c296a264d7.jpg"><br><br>  For the overall design - solid four.  For degrees of freedom, resizing and fit to the head - three plus, no more.  On the other hand, it is difficult to put on such headphones so that they do not sit down well on the head, so the overall impression of the construct is rather positive.  In addition, all fastening elements look quite reliable. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/3d8/339/2fc/3d83392fc52449a79880ea6a9be82f33.jpg"><br><br>  Ear pads - O-like, very much like the icon of the Opera. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/098/827/6f1/0988276f1ab36c20d052c6b46a869570.jpg"><br><br>  The coating resembles foam rubber, they are not tightly attached to the speakers, but I would not call them ‚Äúreplaceable‚Äù. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/fac/ea8/720/facea872067e1051a87631cb791fe309.jpg"><br><br>  To remove and clean (and they accumulate dirt and any garbage ‚Äúinside‚Äù quickly and willingly), it is necessary to pull the ‚Äúroller‚Äù itself, slightly unscrew the 4 screws, pull out the edge of the upholstery. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/b39/15c/0e5/b3915c0e58baeafb5e5634ae8cbc1c18.jpg"><br><br>  Put on in the reverse order. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/21e/c98/d50/21ec98d507b19a431b6f3120bb7b760b.jpg"><br><br>  The pressure on the head from the speakers is moderate, does not cause discomfort even after several hours in headphones.  Noise isolation - on the top three, the environment is perfectly audible (in the subway it‚Äôs not realistic to use at all), but in the other direction it lets out sounds worse. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/f97/eb3/13a/f97eb313aa29258e434dc7439055271c.jpg"><br><br>  The sound characteristics are medium, there is no clearly defined directivity to overwhelming the user with bass or high frequencies, the sound is moderately juicy and sufficiently detailed for headphones in this price range.  In general, the perception of sound is a purely subjective thing, so all of the above is a personal sensation that may differ from the opinion and spherical equestrian vacuum measurements. <br><br>  Included are the headphones themselves, an unremovable short wire, a separate microphone, clinging to clothes and an extension cable.  Unfortunately, their pictures disappeared somewhere, and I gave the headphones to my brother in another city.  :( <br><br>  On the Yandex market for such a set, they request an average of <a href="">1,700</a> rubles, which is quite humane, given the good quality of the headphones themselves.  For the HD version they want a little more, the price tag starts with <a href="">2100</a> rubles. <br><br><h4>  Chao </h4><br>  The second in the list are the unusual headphones of the ‚Äúdesigner‚Äù Chao line from all the same Tt eSPORTS. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/c9e/d34/0ac/c9ed340ac6a299cf28b01c5d62643616.jpg"><br><br>  Appearance gives them the product of the Korean company, but there are people who like this design. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/10d/de6/93e/10dde693e263bf1e9dc1757b7268cc21.jpg"><br><br>  I had a ‚Äúgolden‚Äù version on the test, on the official website you can look at other color choices. <br><br>  Headphones semi-closed type, attached to the headboard swivel brackets themselves brackets have two degrees of freedom. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/b80/1e6/565/b801e6565be9d0be2a863346c1c55e4a.jpg"><br><br>  It is said, perhaps not very, but the photo is clear. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/e2c/a73/72a/e2ca7372a45f97c1ba8144360d6ef70b.jpg"><br><br>  The headband is most likely based on a plastic arc, the top is covered in black kozhzam with red stitching, from the bottom - the red color of the ‚Äúgrid‚Äù. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/16a/6fe/bc1/16a6febc1408d52ecbd8fb21c065aed0.jpg"><br><br>  Inside is something soft.  The body of the speakers is made of soft-touch plastic, ear cushions in the form of a "donut", non-replaceable (or, more likely, replaceable, but I did not dare to remove them, and I do not advise you). <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/877/2af/745/8772af745ab3b374a341e23098a32f2a.jpg"><br><br>  The small diameter of the headband, fully swiveling speakers and compact design make it easy to take the headphones with you - at any time you can hang them around your neck (and they won't interfere there) or put them in a backpack / bag, they do not ask for much space when folded. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/23d/6a8/061/23d6a806156e97b9799b1eb1ea2ab303.jpg"><br><br>  From the point of view of the reproduced sound, the parameters are above average, the whole range of frequencies sounds quite good, the sound is detailed, clear, the volume margin is enough to drown out the metro, sound insulation suffers on both sides, but the volume margin corrects this more than once. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/59b/93a/889/59b93a889376b53be330eef32917a41e.jpg"><br><br>  The cable is detachable, there are two of them at once.  The first is relatively short, red, straight.  The second is ‚Äútwisted‚Äù, a la the wire at the phone‚Äôs tube.  In addition, the box contained an adapter for a ‚Äúserious‚Äù 6.3mm jack and a strange adapter for a ‚Äúdual‚Äù input.  As suggested in the comments - under the audio output in the aircraft.  Here it is, taking care of the user and attention to detail. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/70b/fac/568/70bfac5680ce2aca50cb9078f9cd1f6e.jpg"><br><br>  This model also has a younger brother - an external microphone.  I didn‚Äôt find any features besides the crocodile turning 360 degrees and the mute button. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/4c3/cc0/946/4c3cc0946650f2df7e2862c6d9085b26.jpg"><br><br>  The microphone, as ridiculous as it sounds, just works, and does not make it much better / worse than the Shocker Spin model.  I think the filling is the same there. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/ab3/578/ae5/ab3578ae550901f29b2fea3544f52f16.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/371/9ae/2c2/3719ae2c23ac72423cdbd7cfedb13fc5.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/c55/660/fb0/c55660fb0263a1e0489940eb21192ecf.jpg"><br><br>  It connects through the standard 3.5mm audio jack. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/1a5/0f1/89a/1a50f189a49e8bf3c0925142ed33a857.jpg"><br><br>  For Chao on the Yadnex Market, they ask about <a href="">2,800</a> rubles.  Signature edishn have not yet appeared, the price tag, I think, will be slightly higher. <br><br><h4>  Shock one </h4><br>  The third headset is Tt eSPORTS Shock, which, perhaps, of all the Thermalteuk headsets I liked the most.  And this is exactly a headset, not a set of headphones + microphone. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/b05/8dd/af1/b058ddaf167a52c8f513d172f4e28827.jpg"><br><br>  The Shocks themselves are connected via USB, so using them with a player or a smartphone is simply not possible. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/d07/572/c6e/d07572c6e4bdcc6a18558c68e355e64a.jpg"><br><br>  A separate device appears among the sound devices, so you can assign a ready-made default preset to the call to the headset, and not to the speakers, to Skype and some other applications. <br><br>  Constructive headphones pleases simplicity and forethought.  Headband - plastic with a metal base. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/4df/a7b/f80/4dfa7bf80b35d02e3519252e3da68fa9.jpg"><br><br>  The outer surface is made of black glossy plastic, in the middle there is a logo of the manufacturer.  The back side is a hybrid of a matte plastic surface and a soft lining in the ‚Äúworking‚Äù zone: to make the head softer.  The adjustment is only one, according to the ‚Äúlength of departure‚Äù of the right and left earpiece. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/289/b4a/b84/289b4ab8451cd9e4835604c1ced3a6c1.jpg"><br><br>  The speakers themselves are mounted on a hinge with one degree of freedom: they easily fold inward for transportation, and the headset easily fits into any backpack or bag, without taking up three times as much space as it needs.  Chao is definitely far away from compactness, but the product is more ... stationary or something. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/acf/23c/830/acf23c830d564d55b38882c191b578bc.jpg"><br><br>  The case of the speakers is red with a black ‚Äúmesh‚Äù, the ear cushions are of a trapezoidal shape, interchangeable. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/b79/781/bc3/b79781bc3194ae570963da66a90aa51f.jpg"><br><br>  Included are ‚Äúsmooth‚Äù (made of kozhzam) and ‚Äúshaggy‚Äù (from a material resembling foam rubber, they are slightly smaller in size). <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/08d/8cc/150/08d8cc150eed9f56182f1e0b3ef034dd.jpg"><br><br>  The replacement mechanism is sufficiently reliable - the latches do not look "disposable." <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/f71/468/661/f71468661cd33f33fb0d5ef98dc64cfc.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/9f5/240/bbc/9f5240bbc3e3c94b582d6f8557fa2fdf.jpg"><br><br>  It sits well on the head, the ear ‚Äúholds‚Äù perfectly well, although the headset may not seem to be the most comfortable for owners of large ears. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/11a/605/e1e/11a605e1e3b2d5dc155e9a48c4fe095f.jpg"><br><br>  With my "average" - everything is OK.  The ‚Äúplatform‚Äù itself, to which the interchangeable module with a soft lining is attached, has some ‚Äúfreedom‚Äù in all planes, providing even a small, but self-fitting ‚Äúover the ears‚Äù. <br><br>  On the left side of the headphones is a built-in microphone.  Its shape perfectly complements the overall ‚Äúangular‚Äù design, and in the case of uselessness it is easily removed ‚Äúupward‚Äù and becomes like an antenna or some other high-tech equipment, the benefit is the appearance predisposing. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/bda/c43/e3b/bdac43e3bb175c0a8794fe854dc3b37b.jpg"><br><br>  Its body, with the exception of the base, is made of some very soft rubberized plastic.  He does not keep the form of a bend, smoothly returning to the ‚Äúoriginal‚Äù position, however, his initial position in the ‚Äúcombat‚Äù mode does not interfere with the review, or anything else, yes, in addition, provides excellent audibility.  And flexibility provides good protection against falls. <br><br>  The winding of the wire is braided, on the wire itself there is a remote control responsible for the reproduced volume, instant microphone / sound disconnection.  On the reverse side of the console - a clothespin, and the side face contains the slide switches for locking buttons and the backlight.  Lit (or do not shine) - ‚ÄúTt‚Äù logos, located on the outside of the speakers. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/217/c26/54a/217c2654af515c3764fc07b89bc987eb.jpg"><br><br>  The sound is a pronounced "headset" - a priority on voice communication and clarity of sound to the detriment of authenticity.  However, we did not buy line monitors, but a gaming headset.  The sense of stereo is enhanced, the sound perfectly conveys the direction in those applications that support the "three-dimensional" sound.  The microphone is not suitable for professional sound recording, but nine points out of ten possible is suitable for communication in Skype, game chats and all similar juz-cases.  The voice is transmitted clearly and without noticeable distortion, but the noise reduction is absolutely not adjustable, however, and the regular settings are quite good. <br><br>  Yandex Market gives an average price tag <a href="">of 2,600</a> rubles.  Well, the device is not bad, and the price is quite reasonable. <br><br><h4>  Creative </h4><br>  The remaining two headsets are the products of the Creative company, which everyone should remember well - it has long been on the computer sound market and came to be one of the first. <br><br>  Creative SoundBlaster Omega and Rage - devices of different generations (2011 and 2012), in addition, Omega has several delivery options.  I had a wireless version of Rage on the test (there is a more ‚Äúclassic‚Äù one with a wire), and Omega was introduced with the Tactic Wireless version, with a portable wireless module, a stand, a microphone and the ability to work in the wire + mode with modern gaming consoles. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/e13/7da/b06/e137dab06fbe4b805e24389850303ec4.jpg"><br><br>  I will begin the description, perhaps, from it, since the new version - Rage is different in terms of characteristics is minimal, but support for consoles, if my memory is not gone, disappeared. <br><br>  So, Omega.  A review of this version (with an external sound card) was already <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/ulmart/blog/149856/">on Habr√©</a> , so that you can familiarize yourself with it as you finish reading this material.  Well, the headphones themselves are definitely premium: the box is huge, the package is rich, and the possibilities are simply indecent.  Virtually all of the below in terms of constructive and mechanics of the body is also true for her "daughter", so she will also flash on the photos.  Omega-blue-black, Rage - red, so as not to be confused. <br><br>  The kit includes: a wireless module, power cord, wire to connect to consoles, wire to connect in the "wired" mode to the computer. <br><br>  The headphones themselves are made of matte black plastic with translucent speaker covers.  The headband is metal-based, the ‚Äúwork‚Äù area has a very soft lining, on the outside - a glossy recessed logo. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/f83/c57/0ac/f83c570acd04d73d9f20bb70d055b722.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/66d/f38/dc5/66df38dc59217ac603f50b56e8c68bb9.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/d8e/7a7/b1a/d8e7a7b1a4e1ead92f22d30004ed4d43.jpg"><br><br>  The headphones have two degrees of freedom - turning the ‚Äúcup‚Äù of the speakers and adjusting along the ‚Äúlength‚Äù. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/ef5/4d7/5d4/ef54d75d4c16f04649cd768f1dd7f21f.jpg"><br><br>  Ear pads - a rectangular shape with rounded corners, on the left speaker - all controls and a microphone, the right is not burdened with buttons and interfaces. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/42f/aa8/76f/42faa876f26bcfe5389796d5d5989e06.jpg"><br><br>  The power port and the ‚Äúinput‚Äù wire are hidden under one convenient rubber stopper.  The microphone is the most common, on a flexible corrugated leg, with a ‚Äúshaggy‚Äù ball at the end. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/2c8/211/aab/2c8211aab19022c3e8ab73cb12cba569.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/49c/7d4/96a/49c7d496a6b793c861958bc0a978d833.jpg"><br><br>  The microphone itself is easily removable, at the base - an ordinary 3.5mm mini jack. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/b0a/33a/a5e/b0a33aa5e7ef69ffdd64dc8af690436d.jpg"><br><br>  He can not accidentally fall out, the connector is quite tight. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/dd3/df0/6cd/dd3df06cd495feb7c80d5cac36d037ad.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/343/499/e3f/343499e3f6c22cb4f7431d6ab7dcc047.jpg"><br><br>  From the available buttons, the control is on, volume (it does not allow you to smoothly change the volume, while holding the corresponding button, you have to click to crazy, ‚Äúlow sounds‚Äù to engineers for this shortcoming), and ‚Äúmute‚Äù for the microphone.  There is also a micro reset button, but you just can‚Äôt click it. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/b41/746/377/b41746377164b5482550407fd9a2fdaf.jpg"><br><br>  The headset sits well on the head, the number of adjustments makes it easy to adjust it to fit your needs. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/f6c/b80/ced/f6cb80cedbc69ebe94d32bdbc0af7466.jpg"><br><br>  The sound is ‚Äúhybrid‚Äù, on the one hand, the emphasis is on voice communication and clarity of the transmitted speech, on the other hand, a good sound of music, films and just sounds of games / applications.  It is impossible to attribute this to minuses or pluses unequivocally, but universality is usually achieved by worsening ‚Äúextreme‚Äù characteristics, so you should not expect ideal behavior in all cases.  On the other hand, for a similar product and wireless data transmission, the sound quality is more than decent. <br><br>  It is worth noting that ‚ÄúOmega‚Äù has a powerful enough software in the kit, which allows you to customize the sound transmission in a rather flexible way, there are special effects, an equalizer, and nothing else. <br><br>  The price of the headset hovers around <a href="">6,000</a> rubles.  And you know, it's worth it. <br><br>  The second side dish, Rage, is an evolutionary continuation of the ideas embodied in Omega. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/d4a/70d/139/d4a70d139259a6aadac5cc3870c1cc89.jpg"><br><br>  Headphones have become significantly lighter (about a third), they work longer from a single charge, and their wireless module is no longer similar in size to a fumigator, a USB hub and a cup stand. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/a85/b85/4c5/a85b854c58a0c7e612aafc35479c4297.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/79a/9e8/d36/79a9e8d3680611485ae53aed7d4d44c1.jpg"><br><br>  A modest "flash drive" with a LED - much better than the ridiculous thing that was in the previous headset.  In addition, the model is much stronger (approximately 100%) and is aimed at PC and laptop users (including Apple). <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/588/282/e99/588282e99fdb11968f395239eab54b8d.jpg"><br><br>  Having sacrificed a rich functionality of interaction with game consoles (who knows, maybe they will release Rage in the ‚Äúextended‚Äù version), Creatives have achieved a significant simplification of the design, which for the better has affected the wearing comfort.  If ‚ÄúOmega‚Äù at first seems heavy and oppressive, then ‚ÄúRage‚Äù doesn‚Äôt have such a problem.  The design has not undergone significant changes, except that the color gamut has changed, and now in the ‚Äúwindows‚Äù you can choose the color of the glow and the intensity of the pulsation. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/cb2/7c0/791/cb27c0791659dcf20a29c4cf3b86c218.gif"><br><br>  Another nice modification - the volume control is changed.  True, he now has a new disease - the sound of "pi-peep" for each scrollable division. <br><br>  The software, which is responsible for the settings of the headset, has been significantly updated and its functionality has become significantly richer, but we are not looking at software plushies here, but I‚Äôd better tell about Omega and Rage software separately in the near future. <br><br>  In terms of sounding, the difference is rather software than hardware - the speakers use the same ones, their characteristics are completely the same. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/7c2/643/634/7c26436341a59da1f1969398c7f87ef1.jpg"><br><br>  Price for Rage yet.  :( <br><br>  Perhaps it's time to sum up? <br><br><h4>  Instead of conclusion </h4><br>  <b>Shock Spin HD:</b> <br>  Completion - average: headphones, microphone, cable-remote. <br>  The sound is neutral: a sufficiently uniform sound throughout the whole range, perhaps a little bit lower; <br>  Noise isolation - low: both to you, and you are perfectly audible; <br>  Noise cancellation at the microphone is absent: even if it is declared somewhere, no special manifestations of its existence were detected; <br>  Constructive - simple, minimal adjustments, auto-tuning ‚Äúin height‚Äù, do not fold, do not turn, if they hang on the neck - they prevent you from turning your head, but sit on your head very well and do not press. <br><br><blockquote>  On the Yandex market for such a set, they request an average of <a href="">1,700</a> rubles, which is quite humane, given the good quality of the headphones themselves.  For the HD version they want a little more, the price tag starts with <a href="">2100</a> rubles. </blockquote><br><br>  <b>Chao Dracco:</b> <br>  The package bundle is good: headphones, two interchangeable cables, adapters for other connectors, a microphone must be purchased separately; <br>  The sound is neutral: a fairly clear, rich and clear sound for headphones for the money, the volume margin is not bad; <br>  Noise isolation is average: the street noise overlaps, but the sound ‚Äúgoes outside‚Äù quite easily; <br>  Noise cancellation at the microphone is absent: even if it is declared somewhere, no special manifestations of its existence were detected; <br>  The construct is a good one, the headphones look quite reliable, in spite of their ... so to say ‚Äúoriginal‚Äù appearance.  The abundance of adjustments makes wearing comfortable, and the headphones themselves are easily folded for storage and transfer in a bag / backpack. <br><br><blockquote>  For Chao on the Yadnex Market, they ask about <a href="">2,800</a> rubles.  Signature edishn have not yet appeared, the price tag, I think, will be slightly higher. </blockquote><br><br>  <b>Shock One:</b> <br>  The package bundle is good: a headset, a microphone on them, interchangeable ear cushions; <br>  Sound - ‚Äúheadset‚Äù: focus on voice communication and sound positioning in games; <br>  Noise isolation - average: they block the sounds of the house and the outside window; they were not tested on the street; <br>  Noise reduction at the microphone is average: the sound is clear and clear, excellent headroom and overall quality is adequate for the price; <br>  Constructive - successful: headphones sit well on the head, look quite reliable and fold down for carrying. <br><br><blockquote>  Yandex Market gives an average price tag <a href="">of 2,600</a> rubles.  Well, the device is not bad, and the price is quite reasonable. </blockquote><br><br>  <b>Soundblaster Omega Wireless 3D:</b> <br>  Options - rich: albeit due to constructive.  Included - stand, wireless module, wires of various formats. <br>  The sound is ‚Äúhybrid‚Äù: voice transmission at the height, sound transmission in games and movies is good, avid audiophiles, as usual, will find something to complain about, but I also liked the model in terms of music playback. <br>  Noise isolation is sufficient: it muffles home sounds, playing and communicating does not interfere. <br>  Noise reduction is good: the interlocutor will hear the voice and only him. <br>  Constructive - for centuries: the model is completely immobile, there are not many adjustments, but it is absolutely enough to tune it ‚Äúunder the head‚Äù. <br><br><blockquote>  The price of the headset hovers around <a href="">6,000</a> rubles.  And you know, it's worth it. </blockquote><br><br>  <b>SoundBlaster Rage Wireless:</b> <br>  Completion - medium: headset and wireless module + charging cable. <br>  The remaining parameters are similar to Omega. <br><br>  The stand you <b>saw</b> on some frames is <b>Tt eSPORTS Hyperion</b> .  I was given it at the time, I would not have bought myself such a thing for sure.  But I have no idea how I lived before.  Now, headphones are always in place and always neatly hanging, and not lying.  So if you don‚Äôt know what to give to a person - here it is, the thing that few people buy for themselves, and if you receive it as a gift, a person will remember you a thousand times a good word when it is used. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/5a9/a27/3b6/5a9a273b6050f1857a97b8ff695c4ec3.jpg"><br><br>  Any typos, inaccuracies and errors immediately correct, write in a personal.  Well, in the comments, leave your opinion, your experience and stories about your similar models. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/159643/">https://habr.com/ru/post/159643/</a></p>
