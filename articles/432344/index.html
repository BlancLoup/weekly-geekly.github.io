A good example is driving a car.  If you compare the described stages with the development of driving skills, you will see a good correlation. <br><br>  But, initially, in one of the lectures on telecom, I formulated it specifically for network engineers, therefore the article is about them. <br><br>  Pay attention to nonlinearity.  Uncertainty - confidence - uncertainty - confidence.  The third step is similar to the first, and the fourth - to the second.  In my opinion, this is more consistent with reality than the continuous growth promoted now.

      Continuous growth without a change in quality is an explosion, an imbalance, and therefore, in my opinion, leads to chaos. <br><br><h3>  1. The first step.  First stage </h3><br>  This is the very beginning.  He knows little, knows little.  Everything is given with difficulty. <br>  No confidence, no understanding. <br><br>  Everyone starts with this, and this is the most understandable step. <br><br>  To overcome this stage requires perseverance, a systematic study of technical documentation, a lot of practice ... <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h3>  2. The second stage.  Initial knowledge </h3><br>  The engineer has learned to perform the tasks that are required of him at this place of work.  He mastered certain skills and knowledge that allow him to successfully cope with his duties. <br><br>  He is confident in his abilities and even self-confident.  He is comfortable in the company.  Depending on the nature, it can be critical, because  begins to believe that he knows a lot.  This is the stage at which many stop. <br><br>  The problem with this stage is that the engineering solutions that such a specialist offers, without having truly complete knowledge, are usually tactical in nature, but from a strategic point of view they can be erroneous and in the end can lead to problems. <br><br>  To go up to the next step, you need to set a super task that goes beyond the company, for example, a professional expert level exam.  It is necessary to allocate time for studying and practical training.  This is usually at least 8-10 hours a week.  And this is in addition to what you have to do and study at work. <br><br><h3>  3. The third step.  General view </h3><br>  A lot of additional information appears.  The knowledge and skills that are used in the company are only a small part of the general knowledge of the engineer.  There is an understanding that this task and any other can be solved in a variety of ways, and it is not always clear which method is the most effective. <br><br>  The engineer learns to feel subtle differences in decisions that are already not tactical but strategic.  Not always this can be accurately explained to others from the point of view of logic, not because there is no logic, but because these subtle differences may no longer be perceived by others as arguments. <br><br>  It is characteristic that at this stage the engineer <br><br><ul><li>  loses confidence inherent in the second stage </li><li>  ceases to be so critical </li><li>  becomes more sensitive to the argumentation of colleagues </li><li>  can make long decisions </li></ul><br>  In principle, this is reminiscent of stage 1, therefore, with superficial communication, it may even seem that a person is at stage 1. <br><br>  It is impossible to overcome or to solidify well at this stage by developing only technical skills.  This stage of development has a humanitarian component.  It is necessary to learn to feel the beauty and harmony of the solution. <br><br>  To overcome this stage, it is necessary to develop a sense of beauty.  It is necessary to study other solutions, try to understand all their pros and cons, communicate a lot with other high-level specialists and ... maybe, if it is not clear what the feeling of harmony is in general, do art :). <br><br><h3>  4. The fourth step.  Harmony </h3><br>  This is the highest level.  There are always a few. <br><br>  An engineer of this level, of course, has excellent technical skills and a fairly complete knowledge.  But the main thing is different. <br><br>  The expert at this stage finally masters another powerful decision-making mechanism, different from the method used by the engineer at the 2nd stage.  A good knowledge of all the pros and cons of certain decisions, the constant analysis of certain structures, finally give rise to and consolidate a new feeling - a feeling of harmony or beauty of a particular decision.  This feeling is certainly based on expert knowledge, but it is a separate feeling and a separate criterion. <br><br>  This is like the final touch in the picture, which tells the engineer that this particular solution from many others is the most acceptable and will stand the test of time and all the threats that exist in the IT world. <br><br>  At this stage, confidence appears again, and this is such a certainty that it is impossible to argue, because it relies on feeling.  But, it is not self-confidence of the 2nd level.  If you provide such an engineer with additional information that will be essential for changing the decision, then, of course, the sense of harmony will collapse, and a reasonable person will begin to look for a new balance. <br><br>  From a psychological point of view, this stage is similar to the 2nd stage.  And these psycho-types are quite easily confused.  But, most likely, only a specialist of the 3rd or 4th level can distinguish them.  )) <br><br>  Aim for the fourth step. <br><br>  This is the level at which work makes sense and does not destroy your inner world :). </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/432344/">https://habr.com/ru/post/432344/</a></p>
