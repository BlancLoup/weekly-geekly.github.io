  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Level up in mailings for 1 day</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Email marketing in Russia is relatively young.  Already, many understand the importance of mailings to increase customer loyalty, but few have mastered this tool to perfection.  Consultations, webinars are held on the subject of email marketing; sections at Internet marketing conferences are devoted to this ... <br>  And if you have made at least one mailing list, and if you distinguish between the notions of ‚Äúmailing‚Äù and ‚Äúspam‚Äù, then this material is for you! <br><br> <a href="http://mailcon.ru/%3Futm_source%3Dmegamozg%26utm_medium%3Darticle%26utm_campaign%3D15092015"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/megamozg/post_images/a23/d1a/d58/a23d1ad5853f1a2229a07dae0b1eec84.jpg" alt="image"></a> <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Amazingly, despite the growing interest in email marketing, so far outside the capitals there has not been a single profile conference devoted to this topic from and to.  Correct this blatant misunderstanding going in the capital of the Urals.  Yekaterinburg is a major city, and there on October 16, 2015 (that is, very soon!), A specialized conference on email marketing will take place, and now we will tell you why we are certainly going to go there ourselves (with the whole team), and why it is important for you to be there. <br><br>  For 3 years, Yekaterinburg (although for IT the location is not important, especially as there are not regional clients among us, there are not from Russia), <b>Inbox Marketing is</b> seriously engaged in competent mailings and holds seminars on this topic.  <b>Daniil Silantyev</b> , co-founder and managing partner of the company, was a welcome speaker at any event dealing with email marketing, he recently gave a guest talk at a profile conference in Kiev, and so he decided to organize his own Russian one.  In general, we can confidently say that the organizers of this conference are not just ‚Äúon topic‚Äù, but some of the best in this topic.  This is <b>the first</b> .

In one day, you can hear the strongest speakers - representatives of the largest email platforms and companies that send millions of messages per month.  Just list: GetResponce, Get-in-Post, SendPulse, eSputnik, EmailSoldiers, Badoo, E96.  And the questions will be addressed very different, even the legal aspects associated with mailings. <br><br>  <b>Thirdly</b> , the conference brings together people who are interested and understand the importance of competent email marketing.  This is the best place to establish contacts with colleagues, and questions to the speakers, like the reports themselves, promise to be useful from a practical point of view.  And of course, it will be possible to ask your specific, urgent question to those who can really prompt the decision.  One day can give not one, and not two, but dozens of practical techniques that will allow you to communicate more effectively with your clients. <br><br>  For this, you should visit Yekaterinburg, which is famous for its IT community and is not only the capital of the Russian SaaS, but also the birthplace of Russian Pycon, the venue for the DUMP conference, and now also claims to be the pioneer in email marketing. <br><br>  I almost forgot the main thing!
