      Interview with Ivan <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/users/ibakaidov/" class="user_link">ibakaidov</a> .  There is something to think about. <br><br>  <b>Tell me how I first saw the computer?</b>  <b>How did you get interested in programming and how did you study?</b> <br><br>  <b>Ivan:</b> Listen, the computer in my life appeared very early, as my mother worked as a translator for a company that supplied imported medical equipment, so the computer was in the family almost of birth itself. <br><br>  But they put me in jail for it at the Institute of Early Intervention.  This is a St. Petersburg organization active in the 1990s, 2000s.  They gathered progressive specialists in the field of rehabilitation and collaborated a lot with the West. <br><br>  The main ideology was: ‚ÄúDo not make a healthy person out, teach him to live comfortably,‚Äù which is still contrary to the policies of the Ministry of Health and most hospitals, but actually ask yourself the question: <b>‚ÄúWhat does a person need: walk or move?‚Äù</b> Or "Talk or chat?" <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  So these progressive guys did not wait until I started talking after a long class with a speech therapist and put me at the computer.  There were some toys, a Word.  When I was five years old, I was typing the words "Mom", "Dad" and "Artem" (brother). <br><br>  STOP: I'm not saying that people with disabilities (limited health) do not need to deal with themselves.  NEED  But the goal of life is a straight walk?  I think not worth it.  In life, there are things much cooler than this. <br><br>  Then I went to school, it was equipped with computers.  Due to the fact that I can not write with a pen, I wrote on the computer.  I am an inquisitive person and I wanted to learn how to program the damn thing I spend most of my life on.  I turned to my teacher of elementary grades, she went to her friend, who led computer science. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/401/47d/8c4/40147d8c4623d5bd267582be1c53dbc0.png" alt="image"></div><br>  They put me on the first place (this is where the bug crawls and leaves a mark), they gave me a ninth grade textbook (I was in the fourth).  A year I painted all sorts of patterns, I wanted more.  I already asked a math teacher what to try.  She advised Basic.  Googled and miraculously hit the Small Basic, this is the Basic version for schoolchildren.  There I learned <code>if</code> , <code>for</code> , <code>while</code> , but there were no arguments for functions.  That is, you could select the code in <code>sub</code> , but you could not set arguments to sub, it was very tough, although the <code>thread</code> was there alone and all the variables were global ... What do the children in this West teach ?! <br><br>  For Small Basic, it was possible to write plug-ins in C #, which I successfully tried to do, but I didn‚Äôt take a great interest in the language itself, but in the creation of websites.  WordPress, Ubuntu, Mysql, Php. <br><br>  And not, before Ubuntu was Gentoo!  I collected the linux kernel in a virtual machine for three days.  It gives a wonderful base. <br><br>  I fell in love with my first girlfriend, my mother did not allow me to register with VC, so I wrote a single-threaded chat in PHP / JS, which ajax visited the server every second and received new messages, launched it on a server that made an old laptop , set up No-IP ... And the subject of sighing didn‚Äôt go there ... <br><br>  When I wrote a chat, I came across an article about node.js and sockets.  Carried away by this topic, pulled js through courses on YouTube.  Actually on node also began to increase the stack. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/075/84c/aac/07584caace53adf94408fd9ab1932c4d.jpg" alt="Vanya loch"><br><br>  <b>After last year‚Äôs <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/users/ibakaidov/posts/">series of articles on Habr√©,</a> what was the response?</b> <br><br><ul><li>  <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/company/aacidov/blog/308514/">How to find out what kind of flowers to give to a girl, if only her head moves and she cannot speak?</a> </li><li>  <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/company/aacidov/blog/308772/">DisType: a simple application for communication</a> </li><li>  <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/company/aacidov/blog/309088/">DisQwerty: you do not need more than one button to type</a> </li><li>  <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/company/aacidov/blog/314262/">DisTalk.</a>  <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/company/aacidov/blog/314262/">If you can't read, it doesn't mean that you can't communicate.</a> </li></ul><br>  <b>Ivan: The</b> exhaust was huge.  There were always pull requests in Android projects, the guys cleaned the code badly and added many features, it was so joyful. <br><br>  Croc has provided free vps for the site. <br><br>  Habrachiteli zadonatili a lot of money.  The money helped, firstly, I felt that I was not alone in this good deed.  Secondly, now if I see some sort of stray that I can try out in my business, I calmly buy it, for example, I recently bought a large Enter button in China, anti-stress, I want to try to fit it to DisQwerty. <br><br>  I bought Photoshop, a good laptop with Windows for tests (I work on a macbook).  Now I want to pay iOS programmers.  Camera for commercials, many taxis for trips to conferences on alternative communication. <br><br><h3>  Big Enter Button and DisQwerty </h3><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/9NN8QQS8j1o" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  <i>Our project in search of an alternative to the American button for DisQwerty has found such a toy in China.</i>  <i>This is a soft pillow in the shape of a Big Enter button.</i>  <i>It performs its function well.</i>  <i>I believe that it is not suitable for all people, as it is quite large and requires a lot of pushing for work, but the board is easily removed from it.</i>  <i>I think that you can finish on the basis of the board at home button.</i> <i><br><br></i>  <i>You can buy a button <a href="https://goo.gl/nJqX3N">in this store</a> .</i>  <i>He checked me for years, until no difficulties arose.</i>  <i>If you need help buying a button, you can write to us.</i>  <i>The DisQwerty update for this button will be released very soon.</i> <br><br>  <b>How do you organize work on a project?</b>  <b>What time management, what agile, what GTD?</b> <br><br>  <b>Ivan:</b> No, for what I repent.  I myself devote 20 hours a week to the project, now there is somehow a lot of school and other things, and I am just lazy.  Switched to the creation and <a href="https://vk.com/whatsaidhere">PR bot in vk</a> (he can throw a voice message when it is not convenient to listen to him and get the text).  And so I'm trying to finish <a href="https://github.com/aacidov/DisTypePro-desktop">DisType and DisQwerty</a> with an electron, the first one at the release stage, but for some reason, when building for Windows, the say module starts saying not the transmitted text, but simply ‚Äúabbb‚Äù, although everything works with debug ... Somewhere the encoding flows , until I found where.  So far, I have solved the problem by writing a spoken phrase to the file and launching voice.exe to read this file, Creepy crutch, but it works. <br><br>  I realize that I need to find a team and better organize the work.  For example, I recently assembled a version of distype for iOS, which the community creates, discovered that the guys didn‚Äôt even put tts in there and generally didn‚Äôt do anything on Android. <br><br>  It was necessary to make a competent TZ, and not give people a link to the Android application.  Now I have found a person who took up the work for payment and understands what needs to be done.  He wrote the app and published it in the App Store. <br><br>  <b>What experts do you need in the project?</b> <br><br>  <b>Ivan:</b> I need an iOS developer, an SMM man, a talented smch man who will come up with content for groups on alternative communication.  Copywriter for texts on the site.  A lawyer who will write letters to the government and to the funds. <br><br>  All this needs money and resources for HR, it‚Äôs worth spending half a million, but it‚Äôs not clear what will happen when they run out.  I need advice from experienced people, but I don‚Äôt want to lose my unique project. <br><br>  <b>Which of the "cool" ITishnikov respect?</b> <br><br>  I love Robert Corbett's joke about employment. <br><br><blockquote>  Robert Corbett came to get a job, they ask him: <br>  - Do you program in bison ++? <br>  - Tyk I wrote it. </blockquote><br>  <b>What is the most ridiculous mistake as a programmer?</b> <br><br>  <b>Ivan:</b> I was very lazy with the <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/company/aacidov/blog/321578/">previous article on Habr√©</a> .  And in the sense of code and in the sense of marketing and in the sense of morality.  Straight fiasco.  I wrote a toy for learning to print in Unity, the simplest, but initially I thought of it as a paid one.  You know, the first project you wanted to sell.  I came across the need to change the Viewport when opening the on-screen keyboard on mobile devices.  I read the documentation, did not understand that there is a ready-made api for this, climbed onto stackoverflow, found a terrible crutch with inserting direct java code in C #, inserted this crutch, released the game at a frantic price of 300 rubles (I did it for a long time!).  I decided to write a post about a crutch.  Well, the people rightly said: ‚Äúfi, why are you?  Positioning yourself like a white bird, and yourself?  And your crutch slows down fps. ‚Äù.  Here is a story. <br><br>  <b>Do you sit on Darknet?</b> <br><br>  <b>Ivan:</b> No, only you know the proxy for what :) <br><br>  <b>Here <a href="https://mel.fm/intervyu/5087946-disability_puberty">they are trying to raise a discussion about sex</a> , how are things with you?</b> <br><br>  <b>Ivan:</b> There was no sex, it is difficult to have sex with the girl, whom mom leads to the toilet. <br><br>  I somehow forgotten this question after the bloody battles, I want to return to a more mature age, when no one has any questions. <br><br>  When this happens, I want to write about it, about this problem.  In my opinion, the more we talk about sex, the less any garbage, such as abortions, can happen. <br><br>  <b>What are the most common stereotypes about people with disabilities who most of all interfere with living / working?</b> <br><br>  <b>Ivan:</b> Probably the word "invalid" is the biggest myth.  Disabled - not a man?  I therefore carefully avoid this word.  We do not say bespectacled, we say a person with glasses.  So a person with disabilities is the same person who can love, program, plump or peck.  The biggest problem is the selection in a separate group.  I did quite a lot of bad things, just from a human point of view, mean-spirited, but I never beat my face.  This is the problem.  "Special" can let go of a joke about a woman and not get on the soup. <br><br>  <b>When I first saw a wheelchair user next to me, my first reaction was ‚Äúfear‚Äù and so far I am awfully embarrassed next to people with disabilities.</b>  <b>I think that this is the default setting for each person.</b>  <b>What to do with it?</b> <br><br>  <b>Ivan:</b> Fear of the incomprehensible is normal, we are all scared.  Exit: "make normal" person in a wheelchair.  Put it in the infopole since childhood, in the morning transfer, on youtube.  Yes, so that Dud interviewed a special person (Paralympic, for example, on my website is one of the goals).  If different people are visible, they will be clear, they will not frighten. <br><br>  <i>(Hey, Dud, let's do an interview with Ivan, we have already done a rough copy with mats on our knees.)</i> <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/28e/437/ea9/28e437ea9fbd5f3d491b79494db14e45.jpg" alt="image"></div><br>  <i>Attitudes toward disabilities in London</i> <br><br>  <b>What do you think about the "bugs" of your body from the point of view of IT-developer?</b> <br><br>  <b>Ivan:</b> I'm still wondering: if I sneak my arm and put a prosthesis, it will also have hyperkinesis, or it will be possible to flash the controller for filtering using the same neural network. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/d75/832/598/d758325987a93a125b23b530833672d4.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  <i>The company "Motorika", which is engaged in the development and production of individual children's traction prostheses</i> . <br><br>  <b>Do you monitor what is happening in Europe / America / China, what kind of gadgets, services, programs, applications for ‚Äúyou‚Äù appear there?</b>  <b>What is the situation with information and its distribution?</b>  <b>Who is ahead of the rest?</b>  <b>Is there a special incubator / hackspace for disabled makers / startups?</b> <br><br>  <b>Ivan:</b> Oh, I monitor by pure subscription to the right people in FB.  I can not remember that I began to actively use in my life.  Ahead of the planet, perhaps the States, the Swedes and the British.  There are incubators, but I can not name someone. <br><br>  Oh yeah, I saw rubber laces in the ribbon that should not be tied, I ordered 10 pairs, put in all the shoes, now I can leave the house myself.  I also love magnetic microusb cables, because I always collapsed connectors on tablets, cameras, headphones.  Non-specialized stuff, but very cool. <br><br>  <b>You're in grade 11.</b>  <b>What are you planning?</b>  <b>Are you afraid that you will be taken to the army?</b> <br><br>  <b>Ivan:</b> I'm not afraid, I even shaved my Bosko :), but they don‚Äôt want to take something.  What the hell for discrimination ?! <br><br>  Seriously, I‚Äôm looking at ITMO, for my mother said that ITMO is prestigious, although I don‚Äôt tell anyone about my choice (including you), that ITMO has a lot of PR work and little knowledge.  In order to enroll in ITMO, you must pass the exam for 260 points.  Due to the fact that I have graphical tasks (I cannot use anything except the Word, but I want Autocad), the rest should be memorized by heart, but I don‚Äôt quite understand why I should learn what to google. <br><br>  I think now the time has changed, a person does not have the task to memorize large amounts of information, he just needs to have the acumen and ability to google and parse the charred information.  The fact that you really need to be deposited in your head, as the discriminant formula after solving a hundred equations. <br><br>  In the ICT exam, there are cool tasks to save memory, it makes me think, I like to break off and solve the problem without using arrays, etc., but why do it ‚Äúunder the camera‚Äù. <br><br>  I also don‚Äôt understand why go to university (and I‚Äôm not just given the movement through buildings that ‚Äúprotects UNESCO‚Äù, coursework on electronics or answers on oral subjects. This can be solved, of course, but requires energy), if these courses are on Coursera, Stepic'e, and you can go through them, sitting at home under a rug with some coffee. <br><br>  By the way, I now wanted / want to move to a rented apartment, because I live in the same room with my brother, who plays loudly in DotA, I have a difficult relationship with my parents, and in general the second floor without an elevator, and I know my legs hurt :) (Actually, no, this is a myth, I'm just as tough, I can drive 50 km on a bike), but independent life takes time, you fasten the same zipper on the jacket not for a second, but for twenty, although you can score or do many things , as bequeathed to us TRIZ, for example, I cook pasta right in a colander.  So, the family treats this idea badly, as it believes that the main thing in the life of the university, but I cannot manage to do this and that. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/108/0be/2fe/1080be2fed30dc5cf0b422a0ddffcf0e.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  <i><a href="https://vk.com/ibakaidov%3Fw%3Dwall20124065_4251">The story about pasta</a> , the <a href="https://vk.com/ibakaidov%3Fw%3Dwall20124065_4360">story about buckwheat</a> .</i> <br><br>  My entourage thinks that I am ‚Äútearing my head off‚Äù from success, although what any student can write, I can teach you at the institute!  In my opinion, I just don't have enough time management, courses and work experience.  And there everyone will not care that a person with a good salary does not have a crust. <br><br>  Again: walk or move?  Get knowledge or study in high school?  Especially in the IT world, where knowledge lies in the public domain, just read, take, look, try.  It surprises me that every student has no basic knowledge of JS or Android SDK.  Pascal is fine, but not applicable in life. <br><br>  Many girls want to learn how to walk, to like boys.  I don't care whether the girl walks or goes in a wheelchair if she listens to Jimmy Morrison, gets to the appointed meeting place, and is a great kisser.  People used to get knowledge in universities, but is this the only way? <br><br>  Although the university provides (by stories) the structure of knowledge, friends and employment, this is a very complex issue that must be addressed now.  I would be glad if they took me on an internship or work somewhere now, I see this way for myself.  Or in order to understand that I am a sucker, or start earning and proving such a way. <br><br>  I'm not a wimp, just the motivation to do deadline is much higher than the motivation to pass the exam and get a diploma. <br><br>  <b>Tell me about your hobbies.</b> <br><br>  I practice bocce (not to be confused with ‚Äúbocce‚Äù, aha), this is a Paralympic sport, I‚Äôm tired of telling about its essence and therefore I made a video in Unity: <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/-5bEHZzczZI" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  I like this sport, as it gives psychological relief.  There are few places in the world where you can just shout, if you make a good shot or, on the contrary, you didn‚Äôt hit it (I very clearly speak, but I got a yellow card for the mat at the Russia Cup 2017, this is the law of meanness).  This is exactly a hobby, I lost the ¬º cup finals and I absolutely do not care, I got mine and went on to code.  More precisely, I went to the room to code, the laptop with me. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/3e2/2fd/b03/3e22fdb030bf0af93c80fb0bedec961d.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  I also have a three-wheeled recumbent bike, trike.  I ride on it in St. Petersburg, I can drive about 50 kilometers.  Go to Strelna, etc.  This is an amazing freedom. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/b25/823/465/b25823465d71cc45fefbb5a437e5a0e9.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  <b>Tell me about the story with captions.</b>  <b>How, in your opinion, technologies can help with this issue (well, so as not to beg the government, but, for example, <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/company/megafon/blog/306698/">introduce EDS everywhere</a> , or biometrics on the face / retina).</b> <br><br>  <b>Ivan: I</b> tell you: in November 2016, <a href="http%253A%252F%252Fchange.org%252FPravoNaPodpis">on a Change</a> , <a href="http%253A%252F%252Fchange.org%252FPravoNaPodpis">I opened an issue</a> that people without a signature experience difficulties in everyday life.  From the opening of the card to the marriage.  The media made some noise, several major politicians noticed the problem.  They forked the law and the year is already preparing amendments.  It seems that the Pull Request has already been made to the State Duma, but somehow the maintainers do not move it. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/_k/o4/g5/_ko4g5ofjhkvkgpfhy5zaq0wgwc.jpeg" alt="image"></div><br><br>  Regarding the EDS, it is unlikely to lead everywhere, so many types of papers.  Where will you stick a USB flash drive with EDS, when you give consent to the vaccination of his son, etc.  In about 20 years, perhaps all documents will be electronic, there will be no problem, but at the moment I see as a temporary solution the introduction of a facsimile (stamp). <br><br>  I know that in England, my companions strike the UN for my acquaintance, and in Poland (according to the film ‚ÄúLike a Butterfly‚Äù) you can leave an ink fingerprint.  Although while I was writing this, I thought about my Face ID and it became very funny. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/cg/ge/c0/cggec0g05j3pa9n3p2hfon6m1iq.jpeg" alt="image"></div><br>  "Paper": <a href="https://paperpaper.ru/photos/bakaidov-banks/">To achieve the issuance of a bank card, if due to cerebral palsy you can not sign.</a>  <a href="https://paperpaper.ru/photos/bakaidov-banks/">And get a rejection of five banks</a> <br><br>  <b>Three coolest / useful posts on Habr√©?</b> <br><br>  <b>Ivan: The</b> <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/post/309076/">article about the unavailable web</a> , because it draws attention to the problem.

The performance was rather spontaneous.  The UN summit consisted of a huge number of sessions, some of which were devoted to people with disabilities, and there was a group of young self-advocate UNICEF, which I was part of.  At one of the sessions, ‚Äúthey gave a word from the audience,‚Äù as it turned out, ‚Äúworthless ducks,‚Äù but I‚Äôm Russian, I don‚Äôt know the rules, and I raised my hand.  They brought a microphone to the tablet and I, barely getting, hyperkinesis increased greatly, by points of speech (I wrote a program that breaks the text into the list by paragraphs and reads each paragraph separately, so it was possible to throw out a couple of extra entries), the curator came running the groups with the sixth iPhone, began to shoot, her eyes were full of horror.  She whispered to mom that I was dragging on, mom whispered to me, I skipanul a couple of paragraphs and broke the applause. <br><br>  What do I feel?  Well, at least I (and not only) woke up from three hours of speeches about the suffering of disabled women in Africa. <br><br>  <b>Alena Svetushkova</b> <i>, Vice-President of the Rybakov Foundation</i> : Ivan, I will be happy to invite you to our <a href="http://go.philtech.ru/">startup startup program</a> . <br><br>  <b>If you had the opportunity to systematically change something in the state, what are the first three changes you would make?</b>  <i>(Andrey Dunaev, strategy consultant at the Rybakov Fund.)</i> <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/817/5cd/e69/8175cde6992dd8d5ea476be0f2f815b6.jpg" alt="image"></div><br>  <b>Ivan: I</b> already have the opportunity, but if it‚Äôs in the forehead, immediately: <br><br><ul><li>  Would flood laws on github. </li><li>  Would replace the boarding system with an accommodation. </li><li>  Banned people over 60 years of age to occupy leadership positions. </li></ul><br>  In general, the group Krovostok has a stuffy song ... <br><br>  <b>What are the best practices to support people with disabilities, you know, which are not in Russia, but in other countries?</b>  <i>(Andrey Dunaev, strategy consultant at the Rybakov Fund.)</i> <br><br>  <b>Ivan:</b> Accompanied living is a system of life of people with disabilities in ordinary urban apartments with provided care.
