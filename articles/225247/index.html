Despite the broad interpretation of the title of this book, I gained most of my working experience in the technical field, working, in particular, at Microsoft.  I worked in this corporation from 1994 to 2003, leading a team of specialists working on projects such as Internet Explorer, Microsoft Windows and MSN.  I worked for several years in the Microsoft development team, responsible for training and consulting teams throughout the company, and quite often received invitations to speak at public conferences, in corporations and universities.  Most of the tips, lessons, and stories in this book are the fruits of this work experience.  Although I have a rich past of software and web application developers, while working on a book, I expanded my area of ‚Äã‚Äãresearch by turning to sources and technologies that go beyond development and management.  The book contains a lot of useful information for people belonging to the business world.  I am convinced that difficulties in organization, management, development and production have much in common, regardless of the field of activity.  In the process of making toasters, building skyscrapers, producing cars, creating websites and software products, one has to deal with the same difficulties in many ways, and this book is written primarily about how to overcome these difficulties. Unlike some other books about project management.

    <a name="habracut"></a><br><br><h4>  Who is this book for? </h4><br>  To understand whether you need this book, I propose to open the table of contents, select the topic you are interested in and skim through everything I wrote on this subject.  I myself do not really trust the prefaces and do not advise you, they rarely convey the coloring of the rest of the book.  But you can‚Äôt do without them anyway. The book can be of the greatest value for those people who identify themselves with one or more of the following categories: <br><br>  - <b>Experienced managers and team leaders</b> .  This book is suitable for everyone who plays a leading role in the development of projects of any orientation.  Although the book provides examples related to software development, many concepts will easily find application in other areas of activity.  If you are officially leading a team or simply are one of its most experienced specialists and some of the topics covered can be painfully familiar to you, then the direct approach chosen in the book will help clarify and clarify your views.  Even if you cannot agree with the accents I have placed, you will get a clear position to develop your own point of view. <br><br>  - <b>Freshly baked managers and team leaders</b> .  Looking at the topics listed in the table of contents, you will find a thorough overview of everything that managers and project managers usually do.  Each chapter covers typical mistakes that are made even by experienced specialists, and also explains the reasons for their occurrence and tactical techniques that help to avoid them.  The book gives a broad idea of ‚Äã‚Äãthe new responsibilities assigned to you and the most reasonable actions to cope with them.  Since most of the chapters cover fairly extensive topics, they often contain annotated references to more detailed sources. <br><br>  - <b>Simple programmers and testers, as well as other participants in project development</b> .  This book will allow you to better understand what you put your efforts into and what methods you can use to do your job effectively.  If you have ever wondered why projects change directions so often or why they seem to be poorly managed, this book will help you understand the causes of what is happening and how to improve the situation.  At the very least, reading this book will help increase the chances that the nature of your work will change (and as you do it you will become better able to understand the situation).  Well, if you eventually expect to lead the team, then this book will help you figure out what it will look like in reality and how you are suitable for this type of activity. <br><br>  - <b>Students studying the issues of enterprise management, designing or developing software</b> .  I have used the term students in the broad sense of the word: if you have a personal interest in this topic or you are seriously studying these issues, this book should get your attention.  Unlike textbooks covering such topics, this book focuses mainly on the presentation of various facts and situations.  It presents real events and reveals life experience, which, in fact, forms the basis of lessons and tactics, and not the other way round.  I deliberately avoid drawing parallels between different academic subjects, because I know from my own experience that such comparisons not only do not help in the development of projects, but also do not give anything for understanding the really created environment (it is not our universe to divide into directions, like university sciences) .  Instead, the book combines the theory of business, philosophy, management tactics, design processes and software development to the extent necessary to develop tips on the topics covered. <br><br>  You can familiarize yourself with the table of contents and excerpt on <a href="http://www.piter.com/product/iskusstvo-upravleniya-it-proektami-2-e-izd">the publisher's website</a> . <br>  25% discount coupon code: <b>4b2a06e2</b> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/225247/">https://habr.com/ru/post/225247/</a></p>
