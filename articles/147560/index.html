We are read by children, teenagers, young parents and grandparents.  All readers have a different level of Internet literacy, online life mode, goals.  It is important for us to be an understandable and convenient information resource for everyone, because we spent a lot of time and money on conducting a comprehensive usability testing of KidsReview.ru.  We want to share with you some thoughts on the organization of this process, which turned out to be very useful for us. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br><h5>  So, where to start and how to conduct usability testing site? </h5>

      1) <b>Prepare gifts</b> for users - test participants. <br><br>  2) Select and <b>describe</b> test <b>scripts</b> .  There should be several of them (about 5), they should be real.  Each test task should be aimed at checking the operation of a specific site functionality, for example, the work of contact forms.  You should always consider the real situations: how do users get to the site, for what purpose, in search of some information, how do you think to direct them to the desired goal (make a call, fill out an order form, put a like or share). <br><br>  3) <b>Find target volunteers</b> to participate in testing (real potential customers, at least two or three dozen).  Testing should be carried out at a convenient time for them, in a convenient place for them (you can go to their home, office, meeting in a cafe).  You can invite both through social networks, newsletters, announcements on the site, as well as at exhibitions and holidays. <br><br>  4) It is useful to create <b>a registration form</b> on the site where people who want to take part in testing can leave their contact details, indicate the optimal time and place for the meeting, and also (if you need such information) your age, occupation and position.  Then you can call the candidates by phone and finally make an appointment. <br><br>  5) <b>Prepare for the test should not be</b> , participants must be informed.  Preparation is not only unnecessary, but also harmful.  The purpose of testing is to see exactly the natural intuitive reaction of participants to the tasks. <br><br>  6) <b>Half an hour</b> - the optimal test duration.  so as not to tire the user.  During this time, you will need to control yourself and not help lost users find such a clear and familiar functionality for you :) <br><br>  7) <b>Do not change the task</b> , regardless of the progress and success of the test session.  Those.  even if the test person fails completely and cannot complete a single task, it is better to complete the conceived scenario by carefully documenting each ‚Äúfailure‚Äù. <br><br>  8) <b>Not to change the interface immediately</b> after one such impressive testing is a wise practice.  All users are people, everyone has their own individual preferences and personal peculiarities of perception, you can‚Äôt work for everyone.  It is important to identify common problems for all users in the site interface. <br><br>  9) It makes sense to carefully <b>record all comments</b> , questions and exclamations of users.  They will need your support and assurance that they are testing and evaluating not theirs, but the site.  Testing participants will also be pleased to know that they are contributing to the creation of a cool product.  Users can help find not only bugs, but also feature requests, inventing sensible and popular new features for your site. <br><br>  10) It is useful to <b>record video or audio recording of</b> conversations (with the consent of the participants).  In the form of registration of participants in testing, you can add an item on consent to a video or audio recording. <br><br>  11) Participating in usability testing is useful for the <b>whole team</b> .  And developers, and designers, and content managers, and salespeople, and even office managers ‚Äî everyone will get a lot of impressions from live communication with their audience.  Understanding the thinking of the end user can help optimize the internal processes of the entire enterprise, and not just its website. <br><br>  12) The whole team is also useful to <b>discuss the results</b> .  It is better not to give people a chance to forget their emotions and hold meetings to discuss the results of usability testing no later than one week after.  Get ready for lively conversations, debates and stories vying about ‚Äúhow it really was‚Äù :) <br><br>  Usability Testing KidsReview.ru still ongoing.
