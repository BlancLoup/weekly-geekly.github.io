These are the pages that a user gets from any advertisement - and how they are made depends on the effectiveness of this advertisement in the end.  Speech in this article will go about how to eat fish, and not to choke with a bone, namely: to improve the conversion due to grounding pages, and at the same time improve the search performance of your site. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h3>  Do not be greedy to create new landing pages </h3><br>  The main rule of grounding pages: they need to produce and multiply.  They should appear easily and quickly, in large quantities. <br><br>  The first reason for this rush is the unspoken rule to create a separate grounding page for each distribution.  Below you will read tips on how this can be avoided in case the resources for some reason are running out.  But it is better to plan the creation of pages in this way.  You can create a grounding page template and then simply fill it with content.  It can save time. 
      <br>
        <script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>
        <ins class="adsbygoogle"
          style="display:block; text-align:center;"
          data-ad-layout="in-article"
          data-ad-format="fluid"
          data-ad-client="ca-pub-6974184241884155"
          data-ad-slot="8945601208"></ins>
        <script>
          (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
        </script>
      <br>
      The essence of such an action is that the page that is more carefully adjusted to the CTA (call to action, urge) mailing gives a greater conversion.  As a rule, the difference between a conversion with a well-thought-out grounding page and a similar page taken ‚Äúat random‚Äù (read - not thought out) is 30-50%.  Since the goal of your mailing is a conversion, grounding pages are an important tool for achieving the goal. <br><br><h3>  Click on the button - you will get the result </h3><br>  Everything is simple with grounding pages: they must be associated with the distribution.  This is the same principle as when buying advertising, for example, Yandex Direct or Google AdWords.  If you offer a person sandals, and brought him to the page with rubber boots - you have lost it.  Unfortunately, this error occurs very often.  In about 40% of cases, advertisements do not lead there, and 0.5% fall on a link that comes "nowhere" to 404 errors.  The result is a low or zero conversion and an empty marketing budget spent.  Therefore, creating a mailing list, immediately create the text of the grounding page.  Start with CTA and format the content of the newsletter and the page content so that the customer walks smoothly through them, as if in a sales funnel.  After all, the distribution with the grounding page is the entrance to this funnel. <br><br><h3>  Higher and higher (in the top) </h3><br>  Another beautiful thing in numerous grounding pages is that they can also be used for SEO and search engine optimization.  We will not reveal the truth to you if we say that the more pages on the site and the better they are optimized, the ‚Äúrelevant‚Äù (read - ‚Äúon business‚Äù) and the more reliable the site is ‚Äúseen‚Äù for search engines.  Improving your site‚Äôs SEO performance through grounding pages is not a by-product of a good postal mailing process.  This can and should, in theory, be an important part of your marketing activities in principle, so involve your SEO specialist to help the copywriter, designer, and layout designer who are developing a newsletter and grounding.  This can be done quite simply as follows: <br><br><ol><li>  Prior to the creation of an ezine, the SEO specialist expresses suggestions on which keywords are now particularly relevant.  This point needs to be coordinated with what the distribution will be devoted to.  What will be prioritized is decided by negotiation.  Sometimes certain keywords can help come up with a specific storyline for mailing.  More often - initially there is a mailing topic, and from your set of relevant keywords you need to select the appropriate ones. </li><li>  After the grounding page is created, attract an SEO specialist to review it and, possibly, condense the number of references to keywords on the page.  Of course, be careful and do not make machine text out of the page - remember that you first need a cover, so do not overdo it with optimization.  Use it sparingly. </li></ol><br><br><h3>  God created the world in 7 days and you look at this world ... </h3><br>  Remember the joke about a tailor who made a suit for too long?  When he was reproached that even God created the world in 7 days, to which he said, <a href="http://imgur.com/gallery/flhDB">"So you look at this world, and look at my costume</a> . <a href="http://imgur.com/gallery/flhDB">"</a>  So, this rule does not apply to the Internet in principle, and for grounding pages in general.  The average speed of sending mailings in the whole galaxy is 1 mailing a week.  Ideally, this should mean one ground page per week.  If your webmasters are not up to the task, you have a choice of the following solutions: <br><br><ol><li>  Hire another webmaster </li><li>  Use the same pages several times, with minor alterations </li><li>  Optimize the process - understand what hinders the work of webmasters and eliminate interference </li><li>  Optimize planning - often we don‚Äôt have enough time to meet deadlines due to poor planning - perhaps you are putting extra tasks on your webmasters when they need to work on the page </li><li>  Abandon the grounding pages and bring users directly to certain pages of the site, for example, the standard product page, if you are an online store  This affects the conversion most often badly, it can be as low as 0.001%. </li><li>  Abandon the grounding page and do everything as in paragraph 5 BUT ‚Äúfinish‚Äù this page a little - for example, add more motivating text and more photos there.  So you unload the webmaster, but download the copywriter.  The conversion rate can get a little higher, up to 0.5% on average. </li></ol><br><br>  Any of the above options can be used to achieve a single goal, namely: to create grounding pages quickly.  The faster and more you can do them, with high quality, taking into account all the recommendations, the more happiness you can roll. <br><br>  In the comments we would like to hear: <br><br><ol><li>  Criticism.  What we did not say that it was necessary to give in this text yet.  We take into account for the future. </li><li>  Experience.  You have already used this technique.  Or use it now.  What did you get or get?  Preferably with numbers and examples. </li><li>  What you want to write, but what we still do not guess. </li></ol><br><br>  Good luck with your mailing lists!  Let them be useful and interesting. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/156709/">https://habr.com/ru/post/156709/</a></p>
