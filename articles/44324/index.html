  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Examples to follow and Dream with a capital letter</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  To begin with - a small lyrical digression.  In general, this is odd - like ‚Äúgetting a profession,‚Äù when you rummage more teachers in it.  For example - just recently us, part-time students, were taught ... to configure 1 SKU.  Most of the local inhabitants know what IT is, yes :) You know, to me, the ex-pokhapeshnitse, and it seemed to be quite a dull exercise, and the SQL queries, translated as if promt, frankly hurt my eyes.  But I still tried to grasp the essence and ask questions to the teacher - just to learn more about the object model of the built-in language and draw parallels with the languages ‚Äã‚Äãalready known to me.  So from the words "object model" and "private methods," the teacher was precipitated!  Damn, and for that I pay money, yeah - however, I once wrote a long time about education, I will not repeat :)) <br><br>  So, what is it for me?  On the one hand, an extra line in the resume is not bad, in the case of ‚Äúnot ruined‚Äù there is always a chance not to die of hunger.  1Snikam is not so bad by the provincial standards they pay, even more pokhapeshnikov, perhaps.  On the other hand, homosexual prostitutes are also well paid, but this is not a reason ... the analogy, of course, vulgar, but approximately reflects my attitude to the lesson, though profitable, but unloved thing :) I look at it and think - am I really created for THIS, for the role of actually servants in hysterical aunt accountants?  Or for penny business cards, which are so popular among provincial customers (who at the same time consider themselves to be gods, and the developer is still the same service personnel)?  Ugh. <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  No, do not think, I do not know it - yes, I used to be 18-19 years old and live on 8 kilorubles per month, and engage in web layout for 30 bucks page, and many more difficulties and hardships to endure.  If my children have nothing to eat, I will go at least 1C to configure, even to teach computer science to all fools.  But since everything is not so sad - for that, did a computer science teacher at school call me a young talent, Bill Gates in a skirt and many more what flatter epithets?  For this, was she reading the magazine Young Technician as a child, dreaming of technical progress and a bright future?  The future has come.  The important thing now is to find a proper place in it.

      Tell me, gentlemen IT specialists, do you have a dream?  No, even not so - Dream, with a capital letter?  Not just ‚ÄúI want a lot of dough, beer and chicks / guys, and not to do anything,‚Äù but Napoleonic, insane, expensive plans that bring even more high tech to the future?  I have, even if not all of this is realizable, alas (I would, for example, be happy to do low-level programming and self-manufacturing devices on microcontrollers, and my vision does not allow me to mess around with microchips).  And I know that as the layouts for 30 bucks were only the initial step of the path to this Dream (but now I‚Äôm almost talking in HTML / XML / CSS / XSLT), so what I‚Äôm doing now is also a step.  Let less burdensome and more pleasant - but no less interesting.  Or so all his life working as a service staff, having fun, as housewives gossip about the stars, obsiddeniem world famous companies? <br><br>  Yes, they do not shower me with rotten tomatoes - but I regularly read the Hacker magazine, and especially like the ‚ÄúScene‚Äù section. Tell me, do you really not have it in your chest while reading that you admire personalities and the fruits of whose labor you use every day at your age wrote something sensible?  I know many will tell me - ‚Äúbe a realist, not everyone be geniuses,‚Äù or something like that.  Or they will start referring to the fact that there is no place to develop in their native provincial town.  And they will be wrong - look at the very same <a href="http://lurkmore.ru/%25D0%259B%25D1%2583%25D0%25B3%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B2%25D1%2581%25D0%25BA%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B9">Lugovskiy</a> , who was often offended by rude remarks about ‚Äúbydlokoderov‚Äù, but life still put everything in its place: he has self-realization and money, lives in England ... and his opponents are for sure To this day, they wonder why C ++ doesn‚Äôt pay much to nicknames.  And this is also a person from the province ... In general, everything is possible - it is important to want, have a Dream and go to it. <br><br>  It is interesting - is it possible, starting at 18 years old with a salary of 8 kilorubles and a town with a population of 40 with kopecks of thousands of people, by the age of 30 to become a millionaire and author of something popular and useful?  This, of course, is more difficult than raising a ‚Äúseo-blozhik‚Äù, sprinkling it with banners and earning a penny on the Internet on stories about earnings on the Internet - but is it really impossible?  What do you think, gentlemen, habra people? </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/44324/">https://habr.com/ru/post/44324/</a></p>
