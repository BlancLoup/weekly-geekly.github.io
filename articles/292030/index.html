Often, in order to sell the implementation service, you have to first sell the idea of ​​the corporate social network itself to the client.  When I talk on this topic with potential clients and just with my friends, almost no one treats the question indifferently.  People topic is interesting.  But I very often hear various objections: that there is a risk of misuse of the corporate social network;  that she is not for work;  someone, interrupting me, begins to talk about their relationship with Facebook or VKontakte. <br><br>  Here I have collected some of the most interesting questions and objections and answers to them. <a name="habracut"></a>  But first, here are a few personal rules for working with objections (in no case do I pretend to be complete): 
      <br>
        <script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>
        <ins class="adsbygoogle"
          style="display:block; text-align:center;"
          data-ad-layout="in-article"
          data-ad-format="fluid"
          data-ad-client="ca-pub-6974184241884155"
          data-ad-slot="8945601208"></ins>
        <script>
          (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
        </script>
      <br>
    <ol><li>  Objections are true, and there are false.  First welcome, even if you hear this objection a hundred and first time.  Behind the last look for a real background. <br><br></li><li>  I quote Sergey Filippov's <a href="http://www.ozon.ru/context/detail/id/29390934/"><u>Sales Detonator</u></a> : “Imagine that there is a maze in the client’s head.  At the end of this labyrinth — the cherished word “yes!” —The client agrees to buy your product.  But to go through this labyrinth to the end, you need to bypass all the wall obstacles - the client’s objections ... So, don’t try to give a “killer” argument, often it simply does not exist.  Or it will be convincing only to you, but not to the client.  Always respond to objections, even if the answer does not seem convincing to you.  You and your client have different labyrinths of objections. ” <br><br></li><li>  To sell a product to a customer, you must first sell your company; in order to sell your company, you must sell yourself; in order to sell yourself, you must sell the product to yourself.  Let people know that you believe in what you sell, tell the story why you believe in what you do.  Part of my personal story is described <a href="http://supereon.ru/blog/esn_oilgas/"><u>here</u></a> . <br><br></li><li>  Do not say that the product is cool, tell a story of another customer, which demonstrates this fact and allows your interlocutor to come to the same conclusion.  You need to know a lot of stories, preferably several for each industry. <br><br></li></ol><br>  Ultimately, let people decide for themselves what is good and what is not in the corporate social network. <br><br>  And now the most common objections. <br><br><br>  Objection: “Yammer (or Jive, or DaOffice, etc.) - yes, this is the second Facebook” or “Actually, I deleted myself from VKontakte.” <br><br>  The answer: “Facebook and Yammer (or Jive, or DaOffice, and so on. P.) are tools that have a similar interface, but this, perhaps, their similarity ends.  The first is used for personal communication, the second for operational teamwork in organizations.  It depends on you how you formulate a business goal and task for a corporate social network, what you suggest people to do in it, how you will manage the community.  We will help you with this. ”  In general, quite often, having heard the wording “corporate social network”, people discard the word “corporate”, define for themselves the key “social network” and the association with public social networks, idleness and useless chatter works.  It is not always necessary to start a conversation with the phrase “corporate social network”, depending on the context, the name “Enterprise 2.0” or “corporate portal of a new generation”, or “element of a knowledge management system”, or “innovation support system” or “social intranet.  Your dialogue will be more likely to continue. <br><br><br>  Objection: "People will waste time on corporate Facebook." <br><br>  Answer: “Thanks to the corporate social network, people will save this time, because they will get an answer to their question not in two weeks, but in two minutes.  Because the corporate social network is the place where you do your work.  By the way, what are your employees talking about in a smoking room? ” <br><br><br>  Objection: “We already have an email and we have enough of it.  Why do we need another system? ” <br><br>  Answer: “Watch this great <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3DQIqA_YKeboc"><u>video</u></a> , corporate social network is more efficient than email at times.  And the question is not in duplicating the work in the two systems, in transferring the work of the employees to a more convenient tool for this. ” <br><br><br>  Objection: "People will not go there." <br><br>  Answer: “The transition to a corporate social network is an organizational-cultural shift.  Here will help personal example of managers, their efforts to support the implementation of the project, as well as the successful perception of users of the new system - and this is part of our work to which you can attract us. ” <br><br><br>  Objection “We tried - it didn’t work out, it won’t work out now.” Or “It will never work!” <br><br>  “Nobody knew the name of the new captain.  The whole fleet called him Floated-Know.  No matter who spoke to him with advice, no matter what they said to him, everyone heard from him one careless answer: "We swam - we know."  When on the exams he was asked a question, he answered so importantly: “We swam - we know” that it became embarrassing for old professors to ask him and they were embarrassed to give him fives ”.  Seriously, one can endlessly discuss the reasons why something cannot be done and nothing can be done.  In addition, this is a negative context of the previous project, and your interlocutor is guided in it much better than you.  Better tell us about a positive example of another organization from a similar industry, as a litmus test, suggest that you make a refrain visit.  If your interlocutor has brought a true objection - he will agree, otherwise - you will get a red light, and no matter how much you spend your energy, the probability of success is minimal.  Look for a more loyal employee in the organization and offer him to <a href="http://supereon.ru/services/%3Fe%3D15"><u>restart the</u></a> corporate social network. <br><br><br>  Objection: “What about inappropriate user behavior?  Suddenly they will come out now and speak to us? ” <br><br>  In response, I quote Sergey Ryzhikov, director of 1C-Bitrix: “During the performance on the theater stage, artists, too, can instead of the text of the role start complaining about the poor repair of the make-up rooms.  But they do not do this, because they know that, firstly, they are personalized, and secondly, asocial behavior is immediately rejected by the group.  Also in the corporate network.  The system of self-regulation works. ” <br><br><br>  Objection: “Employees will form trade unions and unite against managers.” <br><br>  Answer: “Firstly, the emergence of such a group is an indicator that employees have real problems and should not be fought with the initiative group itself, but with the causes of discontent.  And how do you find out about the emergence of such a group, if they unite in a public social network?  Secondly, the corporate social network allows employees to communicate directly with top managers and declare their interests.  Thus, it becomes a competitor to the trade union leader, because it takes away some of the mediation tasks from it. ” <br><br><br>  Objection: “What to do with all these activities, that if someone writes something wrong?” <br><br>  You gently hint that not everyone will be happy if some inconvenient information leaks from ordinary employees towards the owners or the general director.  There is essentially nothing to answer this question, because yes, the corporate social network makes the company flat and transparent.  And not every company is ready for this at the organizational and cultural level.  This is the question that the client must answer to himself.  It is good for you that the question of transparency arises now, and not at the moment when the project of implementation is being delayed due to the quiet resistance. <br><br><br>  Objection: “It is not safe, because everything will be available to everyone!” <br><br>  Answer: “Corporate social network is your business application, put it on your servers, as you did with e-mail, portal, etc. In all corporate social network platforms there are restrictions on access, but unlike e-mail, for example , you cannot send a confidential document outside of your organization, even by mistake.  And believe me - your leaders have long been united in instant messengers like Viber or Whatsapp and are discussing very interesting issues there. ” <br><br>  *** <br><br>  In conclusion, I give the translation of the anecdote depicted in the title.  The chief financial officer asks the general: “What if we train the employees and they leave us?”, To which the general asks him: “What if we don't train them, and they will remain?”.  Everybody has fears that the corporate social network will not work or will be used out of business.  It is just that someone considers this as a sufficient reason to refuse a new opportunity, while someone takes and implements it.  I advise you to <a href="http://supereon.ru/blog/zachem-nuzhen-pilotny-zapusk/"><u>start</u></a> with a <a href="http://supereon.ru/blog/zachem-nuzhen-pilotny-zapusk/"><u>pilot launch</u></a> , and let me know if you need help. <br><br>  <em>PS</em> <i>If you have not found your favorite objection or you think that your answers are better - write.</i> <br><br><br>  Vladimir Ivanitsa <br><br>  <a title="Link: mailto: viva@supereon.ru" href=""><u>viva@supereon.ru</u></a> <br></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/292030/">https://habr.com/ru/post/292030/</a></p>
