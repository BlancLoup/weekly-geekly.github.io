I myself learned PHP in high school.  And with Ruby and Rails met in 2005. <br><br>  I‚Äôve been my mom and dad when I was 8 years old.  I taught myself in Ruby and Rails in 2005. <br><br>  <b>What are you working on right now?</b> <br><br>  I work for Elabs Consulting Company in Gothenburg, Sweden.  We do a variety of projects, almost all in Ruby, with a lot of JavaScript on the front-end.  I recently worked with several gaming companies, it was very interesting.  After hours, I indulged with Rust, in my opinion, this is really a fantastic language worth learning. <br><br>  I work at a consultancy company called Elabs in Gothenburg, Sweden.  There is a lot of javascript on the front end.  Lately I've been working with several game companies, which has been super interesting.  I‚Äôve been dabbling with Rust, <br><br>  <b>What is the best and worst part of your job?</b> <br><br>  I like working with clients, trying to understand their vision and bring it to life.  Heavy days are issued when you have to put the inherited code in order, I think most of the developers feel this feeling too well;) <br><br>  I like working with customers.  If you‚Äôre not up for a complex legacy systems, <br><br>  <b>What do you consider your main achievement in life / career at the moment?</b> <br><br>  I am very proud that so many people use the code I wrote.  Hope it makes their lives easier.  To get this recognition in the form of Ruby Hero was fantastic. <br><br>  I hope you‚Äôre making it easier to live.  Being acknowledged for that with a Ruby Hero award was fantastic. <br><br>  <b>In your opinion, in what direction will Ruby and Ruby on Rails develop in the coming years?</b> <br><br>  I think there is a big groundwork for creating thin APIs where Rails are no longer in the first roles.  You can do the Rails API, but this is not as convenient as in other frameworks.  So the main competitive advantage of Rails is not significant here.  I think we are one step away from innovations in this area, but so far we have not done it.  I hope that Rails or maybe other Ruby frameworks can bring something new to this area. <br><br>  I think there is a huge space where rails are no longer the leading.  It is not a strong agreement.  I think we‚Äôre not hit yet.  I hope that Rails, or maybe other Ruby frameworks can innovate in this space. <br><br>  <b>What, in your opinion, is the most important problem that the Ruby and Ruby on Rails developers community is facing now?</b> <br><br>  Our community is entering a time of maturity.  It's great that we have a rich ecosystem, fantastic tools and a strong community, but this is also our main weakness: we risk losing the innovation and originality that made this community so strong. <br><br>  We are becoming mature as a community.  It‚Äôs a great deal to do. <br><br>  <b>Is there a heme you could point your finger at and say: ‚ÄúThat's the way to write code‚Äù?</b> <br><br>  I like <a href="">Celluloid a</a> lot.  This is a great project with a super elegant code, you should get to know it. <br><br>  I really like celluloid, it‚Äôs a good project, it contains some super nifty code, well worth a read. <br><br>  <b>Do you read any blog dedicated to Ruby / RoR?</b> <br><br>  Basically, I get news from twitter and reddit and don't particularly follow blogs. <br><br>  I mostly get my blogs. <br><br>  <b>What do you like to do when you don't write code?</b> <br><br>  I love to dance.  I dance a few pair dances and go to dance parties as often as I can. <br><br>  I love to dance.  I love you as much as I can. <br><br>  <b>Thanks for the interview!</b> <br><br>  Jonas will be joining us soon - September 27, at the Digital October Center.
