      Thus, a service appeared about which I would like to tell, it will help those who want to organize and build a Mesh network. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h4>  About the service </h4><br>  And so, when only the first posts about cjdns networks appeared, many people wanted to take part in the project, but due to the fact that those who wish are in different cities and sometimes countries, it is very difficult to interact between them. <br><br>  Thus was born the service: <b>Map of the Mesh network in Russia and the CIS</b> <br><br>  The main idea of ‚Äã‚Äãthe service is that those who want to take part in the project can mark their location, where they can deploy a router for the Mesh network, and when the same people come along, we will notify both of them by means of the service and help you set up the network. <br><br><h4>  What can </h4><br>  - Registration through the project forum or social network <br>  - The ability to permanently delete the created points <br>  - Shows in the header of the points your login on the forum and your comment that you leave yourself <br><br><h4>  What do we want? </h4><br>  Build a Mesh network in Russia and CIS countries. <br>  Yes, we understand that there will be no Wi-Fi to Wi-Fi network from Vladivostok to Moscow - the usual Internet communication channels will be used there. <br><br>  But to build the islands are free to be able to function, giving the joy of creating something new and utilizing the unlimited tariffs that almost everyone now has - we can do. <br><br><h4>  Who are we? </h4><br>  We are people who are not indifferent to the fate of the Internet in Russia and Mesh networks in particular, we are active users of the forum cjdroute.net <br>  So that everyone can be with us =) <br><br><h4>  FAQ </h4><br>  <b>What standard will be used?</b> <br>  - Wi-Fi 2.4 GHz g / n <br>  <b>Why not 5 GHz?</b> <br>  - Not completely legal in the territory of the Russian Federation, worse coverage <br>  <b>What routers are you planning to use?</b> <br>  - While there is no exact plan, you can go to our forum and discuss your views on this issue, while collectively thinking in the direction of TP-LINK, Nanostation. <br>  <b>Can any router work with this network?</b> <br>  - Completely - no, but everyone can add support for the network <b>only for himself</b> to his router. <br>  <b>How will the problem of a huge number of hopes be solved with a large number of participants?</b> <br>  - Routers will also be connected via the Internet, the cjdns protocol implies automatic route selection, if the wi-fi to wi-fi network is overloaded or the number of hops is not optimal, the usual Internet will be used for transport traffic. <br>  <b>How is it with prohibited content from you?</b> <br>  - We are against it, but the decision on the placement of the resource is still made by its owner =) <br>  <b>If I install cjdns in myself, will this make me an Internet access point with all the consequences?</b> <br>  - Not <br><br><h4>  Why all this? </h4><br>  The current Internet has become not comfortable compared to what it was at the beginning of 2000, but it has become faster, more beautiful, smarter, but it has lost its <s>soul</s> charm and comfort. <br><br>  And so, everyone who wants to participate in the project, please go here <a href="http://cjdroute.net/map/">cjdroute.net/map</a> and mark yourself on the map. <br>  If you are not registered with us, do it first <a href="http://cjdroute.net//forum/ucp.php%3Fmode%3Dregister">cjdroute.net//forum/ucp.php?mode=register</a> <br><br><h6>  PS: The map, interaction with the forum and other things are self-written, we are not a commercial project, so the code is not perfect, by the way, in the near future, it will be uploaded to github under an open license so that everyone can run such a project or help us with the introduction of features and killing bugs. <br><br>  PS2: Many thanks to Habra for the project to help startups. <br></h6></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/198428/">https://habr.com/ru/post/198428/</a></p>
