      The conference was divided into two sections in order to cover the features of marketing and sales in the two most promising areas of the Ukrainian IT industry - startups and outsourcing.  It should be noted that both sections aroused the same interest among the audience. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/20e/a4c/d0c/20ea4cd0ce45c7b33336fdfa79656279.jpg"><br><br>  The topic of the first section was sales and marketing, because, as you know, this stage determines the success of the project in the market.  The report by Dmitry Tkachenko (SMM, Group) on where to start looking for first customers and what tools to use, aroused a keen interest among the audience. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/f3d/790/9f6/f3d7909f6cf9b6e0cb269d656b7bec3f.jpg"><br><br>  Alexandra Ilyina, Opera Mediaworks Sales Director, shared her experience in international sales of IT products and spoke about the specifics of communication with customers in different countries. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/3c1/a72/a50/3c1a72a50ffe0ea552a6bf337e2aef01.jpg"><br><br>  Nikyara Purmambetova (CEO, UCat - the single catalog of goods) shared how being a startup, it is possible to make deals with corporations such as Coca-Cola, Red Bull and large supermarket chains.  And Vadim Rogovsky (CEO, Clicky), also touching on the topic of B2B sales, helped determine which profile offline events are best to attend and how to get the right contacts for effective sales of an IT product. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/713/1ac/3c2/7131ac3c2dcfc8e00e250e2f324d7b30.jpg"><br><br>  Denis Dovgopoli‚Äôs report (GrowthUp), which, despite being busy with the iForum, came to Odessa, aroused great interest.  Effective marketing in startups has caused a lively interest and a barrage of questions. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/d39/371/d72/d39371d728fbc87a4ee96c99423cc2a4.jpg"><br><br>  In the sales section in startups, the successful experience of promoting his project, as well as the tricks of a PR company, was shared by marketing guru of the Pics.io project Konstandin Shtdendenko.  Worldwide publications like CNET, TechCrunch and PetaPixel are already writing about the startup. <br><br>  Vitaly Goncharuk (CEO, Augmented Pixels) gave an interesting and lively discussion on how to distinguish a good sales manager from a marketer and what type of personality is most suitable for a sales manager. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/641/030/ef0/641030ef08d9d11082553627458e45c2.jpg"><br><br>  Vera Zvereva, an internet marketer with a huge track record, talked about how effective email marketing can contribute to sales and which techniques are best to use. <br><br>  The founders of the IT-sales school in Kharkov and Kiev - Anastasia Novikova and Yevgeny Kovalik spoke in the outsourcing sales section.  Anastasia convinced the audience that cold calls did work, and shared the main techniques and skills of telemarketing.  And Eugene emphasized the main ‚Äúcockroaches‚Äù in the head of the sales manager and how to deal with them in order to achieve success in his field. <br><br>  Pavel Obod, one of the most active people in the outsourcing business, organizer of a large-scale Outsource People event in Kharkov and various webinars on IT sales, revealed the secret of infobusiness, focusing on mutual support, not on the competition of outsourcing companies <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/365/194/ba1/365194ba1c1f00c758dd67c4ef0a3cef.jpg"><br><br>  Natalya Stoyanovich, in whose summary the organization of her successful outsourcing company, as well as her MBA degree in the best business school in Europe, shared how best to position her outsourcing company in the global market, how to differ from competitors, and what to focus on in working with clients. <br>  A photo <br><br>  On a very positive note, finished the conference VP, Sales company Provectus, Denis Seleznev.  As the general hobbies of AC \ DC, sincere interest and human qualities influence the sales process, the technique of how to be yourself in business has caused resonance and loud applause. <br><br>  It is also impossible not to note the active involvement of the audience - the speakers literally did not want to let go.  Communication with the speakers continued after the end of the speech during the coffee breaks.  And this only confirms the interest in such events, as well as the success of the conference. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/ad1/0ed/594/ad10ed594c3091a69dd0064ac84c735e.jpg"><br><br>  Thanks to the speakers for practical and useful topics, and to the participants for the lively discussions and atmosphere of the event. <br><br>  The event was held with the support of <b><a href="http://www.opera.com/">Opera's</a> gold sponsor</b> , as well as sponsors of the startup incubator <a href="http://wannabiz.com.ua/">WannaBiz</a> and <a href="http://www.dataart.ua/">DataArt</a> . <br><br>  Presentations from the conference can be found <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/Geeks_Lab">here</a> . <br><br>  Video reports are available on our <a href="http://www.youtube.com/GeeksLabVideo">YouTube channel</a> . <br><br>  You can stay up to date with the news like this: <br><ul><li>  Like us on Facebook: <a href="">www.facebook.com/GeeksLab.co</a> </li><li>  Join the group on Linkedin: <a href="http://www.linkedin.com/groups%3Fgid%3D7430607">www.linkedin.com/groups?gid=7430607</a> </li><li>  Trickling on Twitter: <a href="http://twitter.com/geeks_labs">twitter.com/geeks_labs</a> </li><li>  We even have VK: <a href="http://vk.com/geeks_lab">vk.com/geeks_lab</a> </li><li>  Add circles to G +: <a href="https://plus.google.com/101789932390194916614">https://plus.google.com/101789932390194916614</a> </li></ul><br><br><hr><br><h4>  Continue accepting applications for participation in WebCamp 2014 </h4><br>  <b>From July 21 to July 24,</b> in the framework of <a href="http://geekslab.co/oiw">Odessa Innovation Week</a> 2014, the V professional conference of web developers <b>WebCamp 2014</b> will be held.
