  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Curiosity to the SDK will bring</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Hello, Khabryanin, old and young.  A voice from the sandbox would like to share with you a discovery, which is not a discovery, but simply the satisfaction of a single curiosity on the scale of a single phenomenon. <br><br>  The other day, I was wandering on the site of the future MDD and found Nuance among the speakers - the name was hooked, but only understood where it came from and why - not immediately.  The fact is that, as the owner of the iPhone (I repent), I occasionally use the AppStore.  There (I remembered), only decently earlier, I saw a similar icon (that is, it was not even in the title).  Climbed, checked - really took place.  What the MDD participant badge was associated with is called Dragon Dictation, and it was developed by Nuance itself: it was such a feature in the summer, the app recognizes speech, and, accordingly, SMS can be dictated.  This is so claimed.  I, do not be a fool (desperately killing work time), downloaded, - more like it than not.  As an old friend of a similar service from Google, I take the liberty to say that I recognize at least as good. <br>  At this point, my reader, I have already managed to become interested and climbed back to MDD <a name="habracut"></a>  , look about the speaker.  <i>Nuance Communications</i> , as the company modestly imagines, is committed to developing <i>voice solutions</i> .  Voice decisions are appropriately when either voice is converted to text or text to speech.  Among the heaps of areas in which American potential friends are involved, only mobile voice applications have reached the Russian market so far. <br><br>  Rather, mobile applications <b>and another thing</b> that has taken my attention, about which Nuance will talk about in MDD, and which is directly related to any developer or owner of an Android application.  Officially, the thing is called <b>Nuance Mobile Developer Program</b> or NDEV.  It was created, apparently, on the heels of successful applications, and is an SDK (i.e. toolkit) for a mobile developer.  If you believe the developers of the platform itself, this SDK, which turned out to be several kilobytes of code, documentation and instructions for use, works on the Android, iPhone and Windows Phone platforms, and literally within an hour allows you to insert Nuance voice services into your application.

      There are 3 services to choose from ( <i>magic?</i> ), You can choose one of them, based on the understanding that you need for a specific application: two out of three are even named the same as those applications, - Dictation (dictation) and Search (voice search by content or online).  I was surprised by the third service, TTS or <i>Text-to-Speech</i> , which promises to process the sent text on the company's tender Massachusetts servers and transform it into a ‚Äúpleasant, naturally-sounding Russian‚Äù (I hope, not male) voice.  Several dozens of popular languages ‚Äã‚Äãare supported for each service, including Russian, - this is what Comrade Raimund Schmald‚Äôs speech on MDD is dedicated to, I don‚Äôt say the exact topic, if you want, you‚Äôll be on your way, <a href="http://2011.mdday.ru/">2011.mdday.ru</a> <br><br>  I read on.  It is also proposed to choose from 3 levels of cooperation, i.e.  You can choose from 3 ( <i>exactly magic</i> ) programs: Silver, Gold and Emerald.  Why "emerald" - I think, because look at the colors of the logo. <br><br>  Something touched me honorable "green" membership instead of the traditional "platinum". <br><br>  So, each level of cooperation implies certain privileges and the scope of the powers granted by developers, but they are fundamentally different in this way (taken from the program‚Äôs website, <a href="http://dragonmobile.nuancemobiledeveloper.com/public/index.php%3Ftask%3Dfaq">dragonmobile.nuancemobiledeveloper.com/public/index.php?task=faq</a> ): <br><br><img src="http://imagepost.ru/images/s/il/silver_5.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  The good news was that the "silver" and "gold" programs are free. <br><br>  So, what we have: a certain (nd?) Nuance offers Russian developers a free platform for introducing speech services into the Android platform: voice dictation, search, or speech synthesis.  The archibystro is being implemented (by pieces of the code ‚Äúas it is‚Äù), an hour of implementation, a few more - debugging.  Additional costs are not required.  The only thing that, in my opinion, is necessary besides the desire to introduce and contact with Newans, is <i>quite a fast mobile Internet</i> , since  Any processing of voice or text is carried out by the "cloud", not a device.  Well, some money, if you're still going to cooperate "emerald." <br><br>  By the way, the documentation with the code after registration came promptly.  One problem - I can‚Äôt create applications at all.  But, apparently, it is necessary, but it is inconvenient as that. <br><br>  Civic duty is fulfilled, conscience is free, I shut up.  I hope everything from the story will only be good, and no one will feel bad. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/134198/">https://habr.com/ru/post/134198/</a></p>
