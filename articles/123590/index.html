Odyochka the device was not crumpled and neat.  Rather, because I was traveling in the baggage of a friend (: <br>  Grade, of course, not rich.  It is clear that Samsung is counting on <s>cutting cabbage to</s> earn money on the sale of accessories, but the adapter ‚Äúcorporate connector‚Äù -&gt; ‚ÄúUSB female‚Äù is sold for $ 20 and is not put in the box.  Are greedy, therefore. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/cc1dab88/185fbb6c/9feef03a/59045426.png"><br>  Boxes similar to the box from the famous Apple device. <br><br>  Equipment:

    <img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/b67859a8/c68a1426/d6fce15b/7eb0c214.png"><br><br>  And take a closer look: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/de134347/1b06f2bf/9066f5c5/b3d33406.png"><br><br>  Inside (from left to right): a quick start guide, headphones (earplugs worthy for my unmusical hearing), a ‚Äúcorporate connector‚Äù cable -&gt; ‚ÄúUSB male‚Äù about a meter long and tiny charging on a US plug (Input: 100-240V 60Hz 0.35 A. Output: 5V 2A). <br>  God bless the hard-working Chinese, who sent a suitable adapter with the <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/gadgets/118226/">Gemei A330</a> . <br><br><h4>  First impression </h4><br>  The device seems monolithic, does not creak, does not play.  Retractable parts, curtains, etc.  No - remove the risk of breaking off / losing something.  The camera is practically not covered with a rim from scratches, but is located, as it were, on the bevel of the device.  At the ends are stereo speakers, covered with a finely perforated mesh. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/8bc2ad1d/c5219f6b/8467cd73/e81ae488.png"><br><br>  The thickness of the device is amazing!  You can ask the omnipotent Google, but its dimensions will be perceived better in comparison with the Corsair Flash Voyager GT: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/3b3447af/516a5aaf/1e761320/92af6c3b.png"><br><br>  Samsung assures that the Galaxy Tab 10.1 is a fraction of a millimeter thinner than the iPad2 (which isn‚Äôt necessary for comparison. And it won‚Äôt catch that eye). <br><br>  The back surface is plastic, rough, pleasant to the touch.  I haven't shot the film yet, so I apologize for the photo with the film in advance. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/cd518b07/c4eeb982/b6fc87d6/24123e65.png"><br><br>  But the most important thing in the device is the screen.  No, not so - SCREEN!  Bright, juicy, contrasting, but so easily soiled ... Gloss gloss and gloss again (here's a picture of Fuuuuu ...).  For a week of use, he got so drunk that it is even a shame to photograph (: <br><br><h4>  Go! </h4><br>  10-9-8-7 ... And!  There is a contact.  He turned on, asked the language, time (why did he scare time - I don‚Äôt know - then set up a second time) and data for access to Google account.  Let's see - what kind of device in our hands: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/3d2372d9/e5c8e99d/5eb79139/3cc1c802.png"><br><br>  The device came from 49% of the charge - it turned out to work on foreign electricity (: It was discharged by the evening - half a day was actively used (Wi-Fi, installing / uninstalling applications, surfing, video / music test, etc.). <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/f505e57d/446086b0/b4715478/ec5750b2.png"><br><br>  Were immediately installed useful types like <a href="http://4pda.ru/forum/index.php%3Fshowtopic%3D184358">Moon Reader +</a> (you need an account on w3bsit3-dns.com), Mobo Player, ES Explorer, WiFi Analyzer, PicMe and ConnectBot (everything is free in the market). <br>  About 29GB of memory is available, the rest is occupied by the system and the pre-installed shell. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/ebb2fc54/c73b68fd/46fb0273/190c27fb.png"><br><br>  Mobo Player lost to me .avi (1.5 GB), .mkv (1.5 GB), .wmv, .mpg.  Some files can play on the network, and some - no, you have to wait for the full download. <br><br><h4>  Root </h4><br>  Anyway, but the root is still needed on the device (especially for my playful hands).  Immediately I will say - nothing will come out): Most likely the method is described for early devices on Android 3.0, and I already have 3.1. <br>  <a href="http://www.androidpolice.com/2011/05/11/samsung-galaxy-tab-10-1-already-rooted-using-the-easiest-root-instructions-ever/">We install according to the instructions</a> (the installation was fairly quick and painless, only Java (JDK) is needed).  In order for the device to be defined in adb, you must enable debugging mode on the device: Settings - Applications - Development - Debugging via USB.  Instead of typing ‚Äúadb reboot recovery‚Äù (it didn't work for me), you need to turn off the tablet and simultaneously press ‚Äúleft‚Äù and ‚Äúturn on‚Äù.  Management: to the left - scroll through the items (by default, Downloading is selected immediately ...), and to the right - select.  You need to choose the box icon with a small robot. <br>  Next - control another: left / right - move through the items, the power button - select. <br>  (Drum roll ...) And ... When you select the ‚Äúapply update from / sdcard‚Äù option, we get the error ‚ÄúE: unknown volume for path [/ sdcard]‚Äù and at least you crack.  How to overcome - I still do not know.  The only thing that is approximately clear is that / sdcard is not mounted as a device but is simply a folder in the root of the file system. <br>  So that the Habrasoobschestvu could enjoy crystal clear screenshots, and not photos of the snapped screen with flash highlights - the Davlik Debug Monitor was used according to the instructions <a href="http://www.makeuseof.com/tag/how-to-capture-screenshots-with-your-android-mobile-phone/">from here</a> .  One note - ddms.bat from TotalCommander did not start with me, but from the console it went. <br><br><h4>  Software part </h4><br>  The device came with Android 3.1, so it was not necessary to update it.  Immediately available 5 desktops (without indication of the current), which you can put the necessary shortcuts and widgets.  It was noted that some programs also install widgets for them, in addition to the programs themselves (ES Explorer, Winamp). <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/f98c726d/e17bcc82/96b5c848/911b22fd.png"><br><br>  With a long tap on any of the desktops, a ‚Äúcontent management screen‚Äù opens (I used to call it that way), from where you can add any application shortcut to any table. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/5d38b5bf/ce45e89b/2964b085/23c775bb.png"><br><br>  It was pre-installed several applications from Google (Gmail, Youtube).  I installed Google Docs and GTalk, after a simple search on w3bsit3-dns.com, the Google+ application was found. <br><br>  Built-in browser perfectly displays pages.  Javascript works almost in full (only the slideshow on my project for some reason did not work).  When browsing Habr, no glitches were found. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/c6b210ea/6b17658a/29a87ada/3f70c653.png"><br><br>  Flash works after installing the appropriate application - you can watch online TV shows.  Even banners on Habr√© - and those work :) <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/791b930b/ea19849e/d3995b5b/06e52228.png"><br><br>  An interesting feature - listening to music from VKontakte - switched to another tab in the browser - playback was lost.  Those.  as I understand, it will be hard to hang up the browser. <br><br><h4>  Entertainment </h4><br>  Where do without games on such a gorgeous screen.  Angry Birds were no problem (still), then Fruit Slice was found - tightened.  Apparatus also looks great.  In general - will not be bored. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/c134524c/92e9e79c/fca1f82e/ca8ee800.png"><br><br>  GPS Works when the Internet is turned off, then the chip is worth the right one.  However, Navitel or any other offline navigation application I have not yet installed. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/c0327019/0a99f475/0d60152c/9a69632d.png"><br>  Satellites visible from my balcony <br><br>  The pre-installed application for reading books is also gorgeous, but crashes when you try to go to the market for books.  It has 3 pre-installed books. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/70b3ac17/2ff16004/7718a0b0/c17a3227.png"><br><br><h4>  Summary </h4><br>  This is my first Android device and I definitely like it.  The function ‚Äúquickly correct, show, throw and answer a letter‚Äù performs at 5+.  Missing on the road definitely will not.  The ease of the device, coupled with its size and diagonal provide the comfort of entertainment, games and watching videos. <br><br>  P.S.  Please, spelling and stylistic errors - in PM. <br>  P.P.S.  At the request of habrazhiteli I can post full-size versions of screenshots and photos. <br><br>  <b>UPD1:</b> <br>  I found where he has a processor (or something warming) - the temperature above the camera is a couple degrees higher above (just at the threshold of the sensitivity of my fingers). <br><br>  <b>UPD2:</b> <br>  On a tip from the <a href="http://geektimes.ru/users/yoda33/" class="user_link">habriap</a> user <a href="http://geektimes.ru/users/yoda33/" class="user_link">Yoda33, the</a> tablet was still rutovan - <a href="http://galaxytabhacks.com/galaxy-tab-10-1-hacks/how-to-root-galaxy-tab-10-1-the-easy-way/">see the</a> details of the process <a href="http://galaxytabhacks.com/galaxy-tab-10-1-hacks/how-to-root-galaxy-tab-10-1-the-easy-way/">here</a> .  I confirm - the method works and the whole process takes 3 minutes.  Once again, a storm of applause for the habrak <a href="http://geektimes.ru/users/yoda33/" class="user_link">man Yoda33</a> ! </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/123590/">https://habr.com/ru/post/123590/</a></p>
