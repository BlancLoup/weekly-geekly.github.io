  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Neither tail, nor scales, or as a hobby can be a successful project.</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/bce/076/594/bce076594b95a40fae157758b952944e.gif" alt="image" align="left"><br>  Four years ago, several people decided to make themselves a personal page on the network dedicated to traveling, fishing, and their favorite fishing base in the village of Sorokoshichi (Chernihiv region, Ukraine).  The main task was to keep photos and acquaint other fishermen with interesting places.  A little more than a week passed from the idea to the implementation and the site was posted online on the sorokoshichi.com domain (by the name of the village with a fishing base).  Two weeks after launch (August 2007), volunteers began to appear who did not have a direct relationship to the aforementioned base, but very much wanted to be able to publish their photos and communicate with like-minded fishermen.  No sooner said than done.  During the week a new version of the site was posted, which already had registration and a forum, and since the owners of the resource did not plan to make an open mass project, the main condition for admission to the club is a real personal photo for an avatar and a real full name. <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  Four months later, there were about 500 registrations on the site.  Users were very active, laid out a lot of photos, talked a lot on the forum ... And the owners of the resource began to realize that sorokoshichi.com is not the most suitable name for a fishing forum.  After an active search for a new domain, the domain <a href="http://www.rybalka.com/">www.Rybalka.com</a> was purchased from foreign cybersquatters for only $ 270, and since the fishermen could have made mistakes, the domain <a href="http://www.ribalka.com/">www.ribalka.com</a> was also acquired, although this cost much more. <br><br>  Since people wrote good fishing reports on the forum and, accordingly, they got lost after a while, it was decided to add a blogger system to the site.  After the next update, users had personal pages on personal subdomains, where they published their photo albums and notes.

      Seeing the promise of the resource and the possibility of turning a hobby into a good Internet project, two fishing gurus were invited to work, who moderated the forum and acted as editors (until today, the registration on the site is moderated).  Fishing on the Internet is hard, so regular <a href="http://www.rybalka.com/actions/">club competitions</a> were organized (once every three months).  After another six months, the site was globally modernized (2008), new sections were added: Articles from the fishery periodicals;  Recipes where people published their gastronomic delights;  Fishing bases;  The shops.  Now you can add videos to blogs and albums.  Accordingly, an additional server was purchased for storing and processing video and original photos.  At the same time, the loyalty club program was launched, registered club cards were sent to active users, through which they could receive a discount on the purchase of fishing goods and services in more than 100 outlets. <br><br>  Since there is practically no one on the site on weekends (everyone is fishing and rightly so!), But there was a desire to quickly publish their catches, a unique system was created that allows you to publish microposts (photo + text) using an MMS gateway in the hostel KNU them.  T.G.  Shevchenko.  The cost of sending MMS from the phone to users corresponded to the tariffs of operators without additional fees, as is usually the case with sms-services. <br><br>  In June 2011, a new major update was posted, which included a complete redesign, a new section TackleTest (electronic magazine for fishing gear testing), many additions and bug fixes. <br><br>  Today, the site is visited by more than 30 thousand unique users per day, about 15 thousand users are registered. <br><br>  If you are a fisherman or want to become one - you are welcome to <a href="http://www.rybalka.com/">contact</a> us at <a href="http://www.rybalka.com/">Fishing.com</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/124808/">https://habr.com/ru/post/124808/</a></p>
