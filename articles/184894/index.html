Nevertheless, if you have reached the point of writing an article in the Habr collective blog, then most likely you will be able to publish a printed work in one of the scientific journals. <br>  If you are already dreaming about the future, where there is a place for disheveled hair, a white robe and weird surrounding strange speech, then I ask for cat. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/a5e/4b9/b4f/a5e4b9b4fa08f9e117691ed5ab3d2869.png" alt="image"><br><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  To begin with, I would like to make a remark, I am not a guru of the scientific world, I am a simple person who is engaged in ‚Äúscience‚Äù, so the information presented here will not be authoritative, comprehensive and infinitely useful, but nevertheless it will help you take the path of a scientist who knows.  As a result, I got ‚Äúbad advice‚Äù, which has the effect of sites that teach ‚Äúprogramming in php 5 in 20 minutes,‚Äù but nevertheless I will hope that over time, someone from the people who have read this note will discover in himself a creative gift, seriously will be engaged in a science, will conduct researches and will bring reasonable good eternal to this world.

    <h6>  Step 1. Material </h6><br>  I think that if you are able to write such a post - <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/184728/">Smoothing digital signals</a> or such - <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/183964/">I make my quadrocopter.</a>  <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/183964/">Part 1. Dynamics equations</a> <br>  Most likely, you are already publishing somewhere or are already engaged in educational / scientific activities, and there will be practically no sense from my motivating article. <br><br>  If you think that you are not able to write something like that, do not really get discouraged if you have written such an article - <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/184562/">Thread concurrency C ++ 11, your own technology bike (Apple) GCD</a> or just this - <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/181336/">Arduino: Automatic illumination of the stairs</a> , then after a small cosmetic revision, you can easily publish it in a scientific journal or in a conference correspondence collection. <br>  Tips on the design of scientific articles can be found online, for example, it is written quite well <a href="http://www.kit-e.ru/articles/market/2007_5_24.php">here</a> . <br><br>  From myself in brief I will add, the first thing that needs to be done with the above posts on Habr√© is to come up with ‚Äúbetter‚Äù names for them, for example, replace ‚ÄúArduino: Automatic staircase lighting‚Äù by ‚ÄúAutomatic lighting system for the steps of a staircase in a country house‚Äù.  Of course, this name is not a reference, but it looks more interesting. <br>  Then it is advisable to write an abstract, but in some publishing houses the abstract is not required, so I will not focus. <br>  Then, of course, we need to talk about the problem and its relevance, for example, the importance of highlighting the steps of the stairs, its impact on human safety and health, and the possibility of its implementation using modern computing tools based on microcontrollers.  Then unconditionally decide on the essence of its development.  And make a conclusion about the importance and usefulness of the above system (if you want you can conclude that it‚Äôs worthless, bad results are also results).  In the process of writing an article, be sure to refer to one (preferably several) printed publications (or registered electronic publications), an article without references to reputable literature will look unpresentable in the eyes of the editors. <br><br>  If everything is really bad and you don‚Äôt know how to refer, because this is your home-made product, you‚Äôve thought up everything yourself, add a ‚Äúwater‚Äù paragraph, for example, about the illumination standards of stairs and refer to, say, SNiP 23-05-95, refer to some article from the magazine, for example, in this case, you can probably find something on the subject of LED lighting in the magazine ‚ÄúModern Lighting Engineering‚Äù, catch hold of the statement you like and refer to the necessary article. <br>  Certainly, in the process of writing this article, I advise you to stick to an articulate style of presentation, to be as polite to the potential reader of the magazine and colleagues, as to the reader of Habr, I think that there is no point in talking about the irrelevance of something like this: My hypotheses are 100% correct and categorical. ‚Äù <br><br><h6>  Step 2. Publication. </h6><br>  So suppose you have drawn up your article on what to do with it, if you are still learning, show the most intelligent teacher, if you graduated from the university, do not worry in the world where there are many places where your article will be accepted with open arms. <br><br>  2.1 "Not VAK" scientific journals. <br>  These are journals registered as mass media and corresponding to the subject of a scientific journal. Publication in this journal will be credited to you as a printed work. <br>  As a rule, these publications are paid, but the prices are completely divine and depend on the format of the magazine, whether there is a printed edition or only electronic, the frequency of publication and the greed of the editorial board.  Anyway, from 700 rubles it is quite possible to publish, then everything will depend on the size of the article.  As a start, I suggest the magazine <a href="http://www.moluch.ru/">"Young Scientist"</a> <br>  Prices are reasonable (you can immediately get a discount of 10%), the editorial staff is adequate, polite and courteous, they work quickly, they don‚Äôt even smell like bureaucracy (of course this is all in my experience).  Anyway, there are other magazines.  In some of them, you can publish for free, for example, in ‚Äú <a href="http://engjournal.ru/">Engineering Journal: Science and Innovations ELECTRONIC SCIENTIFIC AND TECHNICAL EDITION‚Äù</a> , but free cheese is usually fraught with more bureaucratic obstacles, it‚Äôs your choice. <br><br>  2.2 Absentee conferences. <br>  ‚ÄúWorks published in materials of international and all-Russian conferences are taken into account by the Higher Attestation Commission of the Russian Federation when defending dissertations (paragraph 11 of the Resolution)‚Äù <br>  In principle, everything is almost identical to publications in magazines.  True, if the organizer is more or less conscientious, he will provide you with the opportunity to discuss the work of colleagues and find out their opinion about his report (in fact this is the good thing about the publication in the journal from the conference). <br>  A whole ton of absentee conferences can be found at <br>  Most of the conferences are paid, but come across those where you can publish for free and sometimes very quickly. <br><br><h6>  Step 3. Popularization. </h6><br>  If you wait for the publication of their articles in electronic form, it is reasonable to register <br>  On the <a href="">Google Scholar</a> website, it also makes sense to try registering on the <a href="http://elibrary.ru/">Scientific Electronic Library</a> site as an author.  Surely there are other places where you can light up. <br><br><h6>  Conclusion </h6><br><br>  In conclusion, I want to say that the advice from this article will help you only to feel a taste for science, these publications will not give you much weight, the world community of scientists is unlikely to get the deepest respect for you, but it‚Äôs damn nice to hold a journal in your hands, which published your article, and even when you enroll in graduate school / magistracy, you have any publications would be a big plus. <br>  . <br>  PS <br>  Are you still in doubt? <br>  Read this <a href="http://grani2.kznscience.ru/participants/sekciya9/KyazymovSM/">article - "NEW INTERNET TECHNOLOGY: YANDEX-ISLAND"</a> if you write on Habr, then most likely you can not worse <br>  Of course, posts on Habr√© have their advantages, this is observation of growing / falling karma, wise advice in comments and other ‚Äúbuns‚Äù, so I don‚Äôt actually suggest you give up on all this, you can simply manage your life more effectively. <br>  I sincerely hope that real pundits will forgive me and understand that my ‚Äúbad advice‚Äù is written to encourage people to think and create, even if you get a lumpy pancakes at the very beginning (just like me). <br>  I apologize to the authors, whose articles I referred to as an example, if I disagree with the author, I will replace the links to the articles. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/184894/">https://habr.com/ru/post/184894/</a></p>
