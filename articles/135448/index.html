  <section class="page js-page"><h1>ASUS ROG G74SX Review</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Six years ago, I completely abandoned the use of desktop computers.  Over the past years, everything in my hands has been mobile-computer, from the tiny 7 ‚Äùnetbooks, to the ultra-modern ASUS ZENBOOK.  At work in the office, on the plane, while relaxing at home on the couch, in the car, laptops / tablets invariably proved exceptional superiority over non-mobile stations.  Almost all my friends made a similar bet on cloud computing and portability.  But there was only one sphere in life, in which, as I was sure, without a powerful desktop PC there was nothing to do. <br><br><img src="http://img542.imageshack.us/img542/8556/73573631.jpg"><br><br>  There is a joke among gamers that any computer on which you can run World of Warcraft (Counter-Strike 1.6, kerchief solitaire, etc) should be called a gaming station.  With the cult "old school" or indie games, there will be no problems for the lion's share of the segment of modern portable computers.  But if you are going to play in the new masterpieces of the gaming industry, especially at resolutions above 1366 x 768 pixels, get ready for significant problems. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Having set out to get acquainted with Battlefield 3 and Modern Warfare 3, I chose as a test sample a representative of the so-called ‚Äúgame series‚Äù ASUS ROG, able to cope with both high graphics settings and 1920x1080 resolution, while displaying a picture on an LCD TV .  The ultimate gaming monster ASUS ROG G74SX, the new flagship of the G-series, is the best fit for this purpose.  In addition to being a laptop with the support of nVidia 3D Vision technology, which allows you to play games or watch movies in 3D with the help of special glasses.  However, he has even more implicit merits.

In any case, with every ASUS ROG G74SX laptop, NVIDIA 3D Vision is bundled.  In the NVIDIA 3D Vision suite you will find an illustrated quick setup book, a USB charging cable, three interchangeable nose pads and 3D glasses. <br><br>  <b>Appearance</b> <br><br><img src="http://img220.imageshack.us/img220/4849/92256851.jpg"><br><br>  The first thing you need to know when getting acquainted with the G74SX is that it is very big and damn heavy: 420 x 325 x 20.9 ~ 62mm and 4.58 kg.  Secondly, he has a minimal design that combines the conservative look of fashion notebooks of early zero years and the crushing image of a long-range Cold War bomber. <br><br><img src="http://img27.imageshack.us/img27/8582/87684447.jpg"><br><br>  The design is pragmatic, brutal and frightening, in the best sense.  This is how the president‚Äôs ‚Äúnuclear suitcase‚Äù should look like. <br><br><img src="http://img832.imageshack.us/img832/6748/48558593.jpg"><br><br>  If you expect the gaming notebook to be brightly colored and with LEDs like a Christmas tree, the G74SX is not your choice.  The black matte surface resembles a view of the sky from the mothballed Strategic Missile Forces mine. <br><br><img src="http://img13.imageshack.us/img13/1541/23133137.jpg"><br><br>  Almost the entire body is made of black soft plastic hiding fingerprints. <br><br><img src="http://img80.imageshack.us/img80/4135/34815519.jpg"><br><br>  The keyboard has a slope of 5 ¬∞, and the working area has a comfortable non-slip coating - this contributes to a more ergonomic position of the hands. <br><br><img src="http://img7.imageshack.us/img7/6678/80761510.jpg"><br><br>  The area above the display includes a webcam with an activity indicator, a microphone and an IR transmitter that synchronizes the display refresh rate with the operation of the 3D glasses. <br><br><img src="http://img249.imageshack.us/img249/3111/53954000.jpg"><br><br>  On the back is a massive cooling system grille.  Such an arrangement is justified from three points of view: ergonomically - the laptop can now be kept on your knees, without fear of getting blisters from burns;  stylishly - visually the laptop attracts the gaze of a bystander;  and thought out in terms of noise insulation - the screen pushes the sound. <br><br><img src="http://img20.imageshack.us/img20/5343/17009064.jpg"><br><br>  All air is discharged from the rear, there are no holes on the bottom at all.  But there is a compartment with convenient access to four slots of RAM and two slots for HDD.  In order to remove the panel, you just need to turn the closing screw.  Theoretically, it will be possible to upgrade if someone has such a ‚Äúcrazy‚Äù desire. <br><br>  Looking at the beveled corners, and carefully glancing at the predatory grin of the blowing grid, I do not even want to ask myself: is the casing assembly reliable?  Reliable as a nuclear strike! <br><br>  <b>Display (3D)</b> <br><br><img src="http://img515.imageshack.us/img515/9137/98213666.jpg"><br><br>  About this matrix, I can only say this: passed Battlefield 3 without blinking once :).  Viewing angles are too small, the ASUS UX31 is inferior in terms of maximum brightness, but the display is a matte, with good color reproduction, not ‚Äúflickering‚Äù.  For this you can sit for hours, without overstressing eyesight.  With a resolution of FullHD 1920x1080, working is extremely pleasant.  Display refresh rate is 120 Hz. <br><br>  Another screen feature is 3D support.  Stereo glasses with active shutters and an infrared synchronizer are supplied.  In addition, the G74SX can display a stereoscopic image on a modern TV with 3D technology.  Technologies at the moment allow to reflect quite a high-quality 3D image, but they hide one essential nuance: when you activate a stereo image, the performance of a video card drops almost twice.  In this game will go without lags only at low resolution. <br><br>  Of course, a person unfamiliar with technology raises the question, is it really necessary to have 3D in a gaming laptop and is it worth overpaying for it?  I will try to share personal impressions.  3D Vision technology is different from what we used to see on 3D cinema screens: the image does not ‚Äújump out‚Äù from the screen, but remains ‚Äúinside‚Äù, but it becomes deeper and more voluminous.  This effect allows you to literally "merge" with your character.  If you want to experience new sensations from familiar games, then 3D will become an indispensable tool. <br><br>  <b>Keyboard</b> <br><br><img src="http://img812.imageshack.us/img812/4029/54875641.jpg"><br><br>  Keyboard island type has impressive dimensions, as can be judged by the gap between the alphabetic part and the digital part.  The control keys are highlighted separately, which is rare now.  Right Ctrl and Shift have increased size.  Keystroke comfortable, designed for both games and for everyday work.  The body of the laptop is made of thick plastic, which gives the design reliability.  However, the keyboard is metallic.  Thanks to her, the keyboard does not bend even in the very center. <br><br><img src="http://img859.imageshack.us/img859/507/17615049.jpg"><br><br>  The keyboard has an adjustable white backlight over the entire area.  The touchpad is the most common, with a pleasant touch surface, supports multitouch. <br><br><img src="http://img10.imageshack.us/img10/4417/20956959.jpg"><br><br>  On the case there are four indicators on the left side below: charging, backlight, hard drive, Wi-Fi. <br><br><img src="http://img141.imageshack.us/img141/2439/19606332.jpg"><br><br>  On the top right is the power key and a button that is responsible for 3D (in models without 3D support, the ROG key is responsible for switching power saving modes).  When you turn on the laptop, the button enables the Express Gate. <br><br>  <b>Sound</b> <br><br>  ASUS G74Sx has Altec Lansing stereo speakers with EAX (Environmental Audio Extensions) Advanced HD 5.0 ‚Äã‚Äãand THX TruStudio technology support.  In terms of sound quality, there is a noticeable loss to more affordable ASUS N-series laptops, in which the speaker system was created with the participation of Bang and Olufsen.  The volume in the G74Sx is inferior to ASUS advanced multimedia solutions.  Nevertheless, the Altec Lansing features are enough for comfortable watching movies, listening to music and playing gaming effects. <br><br>  <b>Performance</b> <br><br><img src="http://img715.imageshack.us/img715/4382/39022911.png"><br><br><img src="http://img508.imageshack.us/img508/8434/18237510.png"><br><br>  This can not talk much.  Enough to list.  Intel Core i7-2630QM 2.0 GHz quad-core processor, overclocked to 2.9 GHz in Turbo mode, 16 gigabytes of DDR3-1333 RAM, a powerful NVIDIA GT560M graphics card with three gigabytes of memory and two Seagate hard drives of 750 and 500 gigabytes.  In the benchmark 3DMark 11 G74SX scored 3419 points. <br><br>  The video card is able to cope with any game at high or maximum graphics settings, in the resolution from HD (1366x768) to HD Ready (1080p). <br><br><img src="http://img515.imageshack.us/img515/7162/16863126.png"><br><br><img src="http://img9.imageshack.us/img9/8753/34748242.png"><br><br><img src="http://img708.imageshack.us/img708/7082/81652443.png"><br><br>  The disk subsystem of ASUS G74Sx consists of two hard drives.  The first hard Seagate has a capacity of 750 GB, a data buffer of 16 MB and a spindle speed of 7200 rev / min.  The second hard drive is a 500 GB Seagate Momentus XT ST95005620AS hybrid drive with an additional 4 GB SLC NAND flash memory with Seagate Adaptive Memory Adaptive Memory technology, which improves access speed.  The volume of its data buffer and rotation speed are similar to the first disk. <br><br>  <b>Interfaces</b> <br><br><img src="http://img684.imageshack.us/img684/5579/82590882.jpg"><br><br>  On the left side are two USB 2.0 ports, a Blu-ray burner, two standard audio jacks and a Kensington lock. <br><br><img src="http://img51.imageshack.us/img51/1110/67666899.jpg"><br><br>  On the right side: USB 2.0 and USB 3.0, HDMI and VGA ports, card reader, gigabit Ethernet (RJ45). <br>  Network features: WiFi, Bluetooth. <br><br>  <b>Cooling system and noise level</b> <br><br><img src="http://img717.imageshack.us/img717/2008/89359449.png"><br><br><img src="http://img694.imageshack.us/img694/5994/50254041.png"><br><br>  The cooling system implemented in the laptop, one of the best in its class.  It includes a massive radiator and two large fans.  Fan speed depends on laptop usage activity.  During operation, the heating level of the components is within the normal range.  If the temperature rises to critical values, protection will work and the laptop will turn off. <br><br><img src="http://img843.imageshack.us/img843/9870/95406394.jpg"><br><br>  When using a laptop in stress mode, it is absolutely not hot!  The only place, significantly heated, was the rear grille.  The noise level also impressed us ... Yes, at a processor temperature of 75 ¬∞ C, the fan noise is audible, but comparable to the noise of ordinary office computers. <br><br>  <b>Battery life</b> <br><br>  Do not pay attention to the results of third-party tests, the actual battery life at maximum load (playing at max graphics settings) is 50 minutes.  In Battery Saving mode and the minimum illumination of the laptop can stretch up to three hours.  When viewing Full HD video (including 3D), with a maximum display brightness, the operation time is up to one and a half hours. <br><br>  <b>findings</b> <br><br>  The heavy and formidable G74Sx is not for everyone.  Its mission lies in solving high-level tasks when the power of conventional laptops is not enough, and a desktop computer is unacceptable due to zero mobility.  This laptop will definitely win the hearts of everyone who decides to replace the home PC and create a relatively portable center for multimedia entertainment. <br><br>  Of course, I would like to get even more, the status of the flagship of the game series requires.  The number of ports is limited (only one USB 3.0), and Nvidia has advanced GTX 570M and GTX 580M graphics cards (the latter, according to the manufacturer, has the fastest notebook GPU in the world, with up to 6 times more performance than its competitors).  However, ‚Äúextra buns‚Äù would adversely affect the price of the device.  I had to keep a peculiar balance between opportunities and accessibility.  Nevertheless, the laptop in the 4th version still has much to develop further. <br><br>  Sophisticated cooling system that allows you to take a laptop with you to bed without fear that the blanket will shut up the ventilation holes on the bottom, low noise level of the system and the screen that does not tire your eyes outline for us a circle of probable fans of the Republic of Gamers product.  Inside the circle, which is natural, gamers themselves, at its border, users looking for an all-in-one combination, in which working issues related to graphics processing and other resource-demanding tasks are solved at the home multimedia center, and outside the circle - other. <br><br>  The absence of the top-end iron is softened by the impeccability of the design, in which the stylish design did not go to the detriment of the build quality.  3D support is still a rarity in laptops, it is an absolute plus and a great gift for any gamer.  The weight of the laptop and the short battery life is nothing compared to hardcore gaming capabilities.  Hours spent with ASUS G74Sx, this time of pleasure and vivid impressions. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/135448/">https://habr.com/ru/post/135448/</a></p>
