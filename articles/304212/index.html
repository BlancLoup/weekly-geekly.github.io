  <section class="page js-page"><h1>The book "Head First. Learning Ruby</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Hi, Habrozhiteli!  We have translated another book from O'Reilly: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/6e6/40f/ede/6e640fede9144ccabf8885e041ec9398.jpg" align="left" alt="image">  Are you wondering why literally everyone around you started talking about the Ruby language?  Ask yourself bluntly: do you like working efficiently?  Do numerous compilers, libraries, classes, with which other programming languages ‚Äã‚Äãload you, bring you closer to solving a specific task, to the admiration of colleagues and a crowd of happy customers?  Do you want a programming language to do the technical details for you?  Then throw out the routine work and start solving specific tasks, and the Ruby language will do the rest for you. <br><br>  Like all the books in the Head First series, the book "Learning Ruby" takes an active approach to learning, going beyond dry, abstract explanations and reference books.  You will not only be taught the Ruby language, but will also help your programmer star to shine brightly in the sky.  You will learn the basics of the language and advanced features of Ruby, such as blocks, objects, methods, classes, and regular expressions.  As your skills improve, tasks will become more complex and you will get to topics such as exception handling, modules, mixed classes, and metaprogramming. <br><a name="habracut"></a>

    <h5>  Who is this book written for? </h5><br>  If you answer yes to all the following questions ... <br>  1. Do you have a computer with a text editor? <br>  2. Do you want to learn a programming language with which the development process becomes simple and productive? <br>  3. Do you prefer lively conversation to dry, boring academic lectures? <br><br>  ... then this book is for you. <br><br>  Who this book is not suitable? <br>  If you answer yes to any of the following questions: <br>  1. You absolutely do not understand computers?  (It is not necessary to be an expert, but you must understand what files and folders are, be able to start a terminal application and use a simple text editor.) <br>  2. Are you a super-duper developer who needs a reference? <br>  3. Are you afraid to try something new?  Rather, go to the dentist, than wear a striped with a checkered?  You think that a technical book, in which inheritance is explained on the example of armadillos, cannot be serious? <br><br>  ... this book is not for you. <br><br><h5>  This is what we did: </h5><br>  We used <b>pictures</b> , because the brain is better adapted to the perception of graphics than text.  From a brain point of view, drawing is worth a thousand words.  And when the text is combined with graphics, we embed the text directly into the drawings, because the brain works more efficiently. <br><br>  We use <b>redundancy</b> : we repeat the same thing several times, using different means of transmitting information, we turn to different feelings - and all to increase the likelihood that the material will be encoded in several areas of your brain. <br><br>  We use concepts and drawings in a somewhat <b>unexpected</b> way, because the brain perceives new information better.  In addition, drawings and ideas usually have an <b>emotional</b> content, because the brain pays attention to the biochemistry of emotions.  What makes us feel is best remembered - whether it is a <b>joke</b> , <b>surprise</b> or <b>interest</b> . <br><br>  We use <b>conversational style</b> , because the brain perceives information better when you are participating in a conversation, rather than passively listening to a lecture.  This happens when reading. <br><br>  The book includes numerous <b>exercises</b> , because the brain remembers better when you do something.  We tried to make them difficult, but interesting - that is what most readers prefer. <br><br>  We have combined <b>several</b> learning <b>styles</b> , because some readers prefer step-by-step descriptions, others tend to present a ‚Äúbig picture‚Äù first, and a third lacks a code fragment.  Regardless of your personal preferences, it is useful to see several options for the presentation of one material. <br><br>  We tried to use <b>both hemispheres of your brain</b> ;  This increases the likelihood of learning.  While one side of the brain is working, the other often has the opportunity to rest;  This increases the effectiveness of training for a long time. <br><br>  The book also includes <b>stories</b> and exercises reflecting <b>other points of view</b> .  The brain learns deeper information when it has to evaluate and make judgments. <br><br>  The book often contains <b>questions</b> that are not always possible to give a simple answer, because the brain learns faster and remembers when it has to do something.  It‚Äôs impossible to build muscle by watching others do it.  However, we made sure that the efforts of readers were made in the right direction.  You do not have to wrestle with unintelligible examples or to understand a complex, oversaturated technical jargon or too concise text. <br><br>  In the stories, examples, in the pictures <b>people</b> are used - because you are <b>human</b> too.  And your brain pays more attention to people than to inanimate <b>objects</b> . <br><br><h5>  Note </h5><br>  This is a tutorial, not a reference book.  We deliberately removed from the book everything that could interfere with the study of the material on which you are working.  And when you first read a book, you should start from the very beginning, because the book assumes that the reader has certain knowledge and experience. <br><br>  <b>A little programming experience in another language won't hurt</b> . <br>  Many developers switch to Ruby after another programming language (often trying to stay away from this language).  The material is presented at a level that is understandable even for a beginner, but we do not explain in detail what a variable is and how an if command works.  It will be easier for you if you at least represent these topics in general terms. <br><br>  <b>We are not trying to describe in detail each class, library and method.</b> <br>  Ruby has many built-in classes and methods.  Of course, all of them are of interest, but we would not have been able to consider them even in a book of twice the volume.  Our focus will be on the main classes and methods that are important to you - the novice developer.  We will make sure that you understand their essence well and feel confident enough about when and how they should be used.  In any case, after reading the book, you can take any reference book and quickly find information about all the classes and methods that are not covered in the book. <br><br>  <b>Exercises are MANDATORY.</b> <br>  Exercises are part of the main material of the book.  Some exercises contribute to the memorization of the material, others help to better understand it, others focus on its practical application.  Do not skip exercises. <br><br>  <b>Repetition is intentional.</b> <br>  The books in this series have one fundamental feature: we want you to really understand the material well.  And so that you remember everything that they learned.  Most reference books do not aim to memorize successfully, but this is not a reference book, but a textbook, so some concepts are presented in the book several times. <br><br>  <b>Examples were made as compact as possible.</b> <br>  Our readers don‚Äôt like to look at 200 lines of code in the examples to find two really important lines.  Most of the examples of the book are given in the minimum possible context, so that the part you are studying is simple and intuitive.  Do not expect that all examples will be protected from errors, or at least complete - they are written for educational purposes and do not always have full functionality. <br><br>  All sample files are available for download on the Internet.  You will find them at <a href="http://headfirstruby.com/">headfirstruby.com</a> . <br><br><h5>  Author </h5><br>  <b>Jay McGavren</b> was involved in automating a company operating in the hotel industry when a colleague showed him the book Programming Perl (the so-called ‚Äúbook with a camel‚Äù).  Jay instantly became a Perl fan because he liked to write code without waiting for a group of 10 people to set up an assembly system.  At the same time, he had a crazy idea to ever write a technical book himself. <br><br>  In 2007, when Perl's development reached a dead end, Jay began to look for a new interpretable language.  Ruby won - thanks to its strong <br>  object orientation, superior support and incredible flexibility.  Since then, he used Ruby to work on two <br>  libraries, a project in the field of art, and also engaged in independent development using Ruby on Rails.  Since 2011, he has worked in the field of online developer training. <br><br>  You can read Jay on Twitter at <a href="https://twitter.com/jaymcgavren">https://twitter.com/jaymcgavren</a> or visit his personal website <a href="http://jay.mcgavren.com/">http://jay.mcgavren.com</a> . <br><br>  More information about the book can be found on <a href="http://www.piter.com/collection/all/product/head-first-izuchaem-ruby">the publisher's website.</a> <br>  <a href="http://storage.piter.com/upload/contents/978549602278/978549602278_X.pdf">Table of contents</a> <br>  <a href="http://storage.piter.com/upload/contents/978549602278/978549602278_p.pdf">Excerpt</a> <br><br>  For Habrozhiteley 25% coupon discount - <b>Ruby</b> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/304212/">https://habr.com/ru/post/304212/</a></p>
