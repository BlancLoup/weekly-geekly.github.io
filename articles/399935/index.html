  <section class="page js-page"><h1>After the accident: how to assess the damage to the car</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  This summer, my colleague published a post ( <a href="https://geektimes.ru/post/278784/">‚ÄúWhy it doesn‚Äôt work‚Äù: Telematics and cost reductions in hull insurance</a> ) based on a thematic podcast in which I participate as an expert. <br><br>  Today I decided to move away a bit from the topic of new technologies and share my experience regarding more general questions, answers to which practically every motorist is interested. <br><br>  The main question that concerns the driver after any accident is the size of the damage.  How to determine it and what diagnostics are carried out by experts - let's talk about this.

     <a href="https://geektimes.ru/post/283520/"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/7bd/dff/fee/7bddfffee6064bcc865991e082286ccb.jpg"></a> <a name="habracut"></a><br><br><h2>  Where to go after registration of an accident </h2><br>  After all the documents have been drawn up and the driver turned to the insurance company, the insurer is obliged to set the time and place of the vehicle inspection to assess the damage within five days. <br><br>  The time of the appraisal of the car is assigned taking into account the work schedule of the insurance and expert organizations.  If the damage is so strong that it is impossible to get to the place by its course, the condition of the car is estimated at the location of the car (wherever the tow truck took it). <br><br>  At this stage, if the driver agrees with the results of the assessment and the amount of compensation, he receives payment.  And if a compromise is not reached, then the car owner has the right to appeal to independent experts. <br><br><h2>  What you need to know about the independent examination </h2><br>  Independent experts are not only approached in case of problems with insurance payments.  Specialists may resort to the help of the person responsible for the accident, if he does not agree with the amount of damage, independent experts may also be needed to investigate the causes of accidents, to establish hidden damage and determine the list of necessary restoration work after an accident. <br><br>  According to the <a href="http://www.consultant.ru/document/cons_doc_LAW_36528/41b0dd096ea5069becd4755bf9d221eeebf8111a/">law</a> , only a certified technician entered in the federal register can act as an independent expert.  If it comes to court, then the losing party pays for the services of an expert. <br><br>  It is important to remember that in order to conduct an independent examination, certain conditions must be met.  First, from the moment of the accident to the beginning of the work of the expert, the technical condition of the machine should not change.  Secondly, the assessment work should be carried out in the daytime or in a well-lit room.  Thirdly, the specialist must have relevant documents confirming that he has the right to engage in expert activities. <br><br>  The insurance company has no right to refuse to accept the results of an independent examination, just as it cannot forbid the driver to conduct it.  Such examination may be appointed at any time, but it is best to use it immediately after the accident. <br><br>  Before the introduction of a unified method of calculation, experts from insurance companies considered who was in that much.  At the same time, independent experts, who were attracted by the client, made calculations in different ways, as a rule, their estimates turned out to be higher than the amount of damage, albeit slightly.  As a result, there was a strong scatter: some wanted to pay less, while others wanted more. <br><br>  With the introduction of a uniform methodology for calculating the client-insurer relationship in PCA, they became more expected and acceptable to both parties, but the differences remained.  We believe that the situation will change the natural form of compensation in the form of repair of the machine. <br><br>  It is equally important that the client understands that payments on MTPL and CASCO can be completely different.  The law on OSAGO clearly states that the payment is made at average market prices at the place of operation of the vehicle.  In hull insurance there is a possibility of choosing a service station: repairs from ‚Äúofficials‚Äù, service stations at the insurer's / insurer's choice, etc. <br><br><h2>  How will damage be assessed? </h2><br>  To assess the technical condition of the machine, in accordance with the law, an auto-technical examination is appointed.  The list of works includes: procedures that establish visible and hidden damage, causes of accidents, examination of road conditions, etc.  After these works, a holistic picture is restored, on the basis of which conclusions are drawn on all disputed issues and the amount of compensation. <br><br>  When conducting a damage assessment, first of all, specialists should make sure that all the components and mechanisms of the car are in good condition before the accident, to be sure that it was not a breakdown that led to the accident.  In addition, before proceeding with the repair, experts should carry out a competent troubleshooting of body damage. <br><br>  In order to select certain types of repair for specific parts, the employees of the workshop, as well as independent experts themselves, use various software (for example, a database of automotive parts with detailed recommendations from manufacturers for their repair). <br><br>  During the determination of the extent of damage, the car is driven to a special stand, on which a wheel alignment is carried out and defects in the suspension are determined.  Specialists also work with the geometry of the body, comparing all the gaps and slots with the corresponding database, use instruments that help identify chips and scratches, measuring the thickness of the paint. <br><br>  So, what is required to assess car damage: <br><br><ul><li>  Contact the insurance, agree on the time and place of inspection of the machine </li><li>  Provide a car at the appointed time </li><li>  In case of disagreement with the results of the examination by an insurance specialist, contact an independent expert. </li><li>  Provide an independent specialist with his passport, passport and certificate of registration on the vehicle, a certificate from the traffic police and a vehicle inspection report by a previous expert (if the inspection was carried out). </li></ul><br>  Then the experts, using the appropriate equipment, carry out the necessary work, assess the damage received during the accident, and issue the appropriate conclusion.  With this document, the driver can work with the insurance, and with the court, if suddenly it comes to him. <br><br>  PS I will be glad to discuss your thoughts on the topic, if you see fit to share them in the comments. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/399935/">https://habr.com/ru/post/399935/</a></p>
