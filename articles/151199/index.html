This is expressed not only in blocking the deceiver and his lots, but also in preventing his further life in the auction. <br><br>  Some details of the protection system and the history of one failed fraud - under the cut. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h4>  Divorce </h4><br>  On eBay, a huge number of people from almost all countries buy and sell goods.  Naturally, this is a very favorable environment for breeding all sorts of dark personalities: scammers, thieves, throwing and the like.

    <h5>  Small retreat </h5><br>  <i>Everything described below does not concern me in any way.</i>  <i>Please do not identify me with a friend who tried to throw buyers on eBay.</i> <br><br>  One day, a certain experienced eBay buyer (with a rather large rating and three years of ‚Äúlife‚Äù at the auction) decided to quickly cut down a couple of thousand green dollars.  His technique was quite simple. <br><br>  He creates a lot at auction with the title "iPhone 4S APPLE BRAND NEW SALE 100% - link inside".  Type of sale - ‚Äúauction only‚Äù with a starting price of $ 1 and a week of life.  Delivery is free to any point of our ball. <br>  In the body of the lot, everything indicates that a new phone is being sold, in a film and with all the documents. <br>  Except for one thing - closer to the end of the description with an honest red font (without italics and bold, of course) it is stated: ‚ÄúThis is an online store.  No phone, only link! ‚Äù. <br><br>  Then the lot goes to free swimming in the auction.  No additional funds for the promotion of the lot does not apply. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/ef7/c2f/112/ef7c2f11226d19d5bb38bd0513ff4219.jpg"><br><br><h4>  Buyers </h4><br>  Oddly enough, in 3 days more than 20 people decided to ‚Äúbuy into‚Äù a fairly frank divorce.  Rates increased and the price of the lot was close to $ 500.  In parallel with the first, the fraudster creates 5 more lots (greed, she is, yes ..) on several iPhones and iPads.  Descriptions, of course, relevant.  It remains to wait a week and withdraw the honestly commited money from the account. <br><br><h4>  Punishment </h4><br>  However, on the fifth day of the fraudster, an unpleasant surprise awaits - he discovers several letters in his mailbox.  The content is approximately as follows: <br><ol><li>  Your listing has been stoped </li><li>  Your account has been blocked </li><li>  A few more notifications that the account is suspected of fraud, that it is blocked and all listings are canceled and deleted. </li></ol><br>  Obviously, some kind of responsible user "snitched" the security service and she removed the controversial listings and the creator of these to boot. <br><br>  In principle, everything happened very logical and this story did not bring anything unusual.  But the most interesting is in the last section. <br><br><h4>  Effects </h4><br>  In the rules of eBay there is such a point - if you are "banned", then forever.  It is not allowed to register again.  But the SAT of the auction turns a blind eye to it, and even being banned, the user can register again and continue shopping.  But not sales. <br>  In the event that a request for a sale is received again from an account registered by a blocked user, it will be blocked instantly, without waiting for consideration by the moderator.  Even if you are trying to honestly sell a set of clips for $ 0.1. <br>  Moreover, if the user changes the PC, name, address, plastic card and PayPal account, it will also be blocked.  This time, however, in a day or two.  And again when trying to sell something. <br>  How their recognition system works is unknown.  Support PayPal says, jokingly, that this is ‚ÄúOur Corporate Magic‚Äù.  But everyone who has ‚Äúsinned‚Äù is banned.  Once and for all. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/034/02e/04e/03402e04ef320b4649e7490d7ca65d8e.jpg"><br><br><h4>  findings </h4><br>  Although eBay seems to be such a nutritious soup for breeding all sorts of parasitic bacteria, but in fact it‚Äôs unlikely to use the gullibility of naive Americans / Europeans.  Security auction is unlikely to give you cash in on someone else's inattention. <br><br><h4>  Questions </h4><br>  Maybe you have a similar case?  Have you heard from anyone about the successful cheats on eBay?  Tell that! </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/151199/">https://habr.com/ru/post/151199/</a></p>
