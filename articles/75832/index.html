  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Online store of industrial equipment</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  To begin with, I got a job in a company that sells industrial equipment and components more than a year ago.  I worked there part-time, something like an incoming employee.  Soon, I suggested to the authorities to develop an online store, as this can increase and simplify sales. <br>  Why am I saying simplify?  All due to the fact that there are different types of equipment, some are conditionally 5.000rub, while others are more than 500.000 euros.  That's just, expensive equipment to sell via the Internet is difficult, if not impossible, all due to the fact that such equipment is bought by factories and enterprises, and of course, everything goes through the main engineers and kickbacks to them to buy from you, this the simplest scheme, most often everything is much more complicated. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br><h4>  Start </h4><br>  It all started with the fact that I began to choose a management system, a large number of different systems are offered on the market.  Since the store did not require particularly complex functions and capabilities, customers often are no longer young people and the simpler it is for them, the better. <br><br>  The simplicity of the interface ( <i>intuitively clear - all contacts are visible</i> ), how not cool, but people refuse to register and order via the Internet, more than 70% of customers still call and order by phone.  We even indicated discounts for registered users, those who make an order through the online store, and not by phone.  All because of the fact that to reduce the burden on consultants, as they had to communicate by telephone and via the Internet.  And to find experienced and knowledgeable employees of the equipment is expensive.  Especially for a developing project, that's why we tried to reduce the load.

    <h4>  Step 2. Cash payment </h4><br>  The problem we faced was the sale of equipment at retail, many of our customers ordered equipment at the garage, to the country, etc.  Our company was registered as an LLC and we could not issue an invoice for a part of our clients; they came to the office and took the goods for cash.  The head solved this problem simply, in his opinion, he registered another IP, through which he sold for cash. <br><br><h4>  Step 3. Maintenance </h4><br>  Equipment maintenance, here with it, the most, in our opinion, big problems, as much of it requires constant maintenance.  To do this, we held talks with a number of services by region and concluded agreements to accept for maintenance and warranty service for our customers.  I‚Äôll say right away that in my opinion, it was the most difficult, since there are practically no foreign industrial equipment service centers in Russia and we had to negotiate with companies like ORDER, etc. <br><br><h4>  Step 4. Delivery </h4><br>  There are no problems now, many transport companies are ready to deliver cargo anywhere.  But we solved this problem in our own way ... Many dealers have regional offices, and since we are their partners, we ship from the place where the order was made.  What is the catch?  And in anything, just dealers, they sell us at a low price, so to speak wholesale, no matter where we made the order and where we ask to deliver, but they will not sell the customer directly, for this customer, at the same price. cheaper and more profitable to order anyway from us. <br><br><h4>  Results </h4><br>  The store paid off only after 3 months, all due to the fact that at first we were dealing with purely organizational issues, rather than optimization and promotion, but even without this, attendance and customers were. <br><br>  There is competition, but mainly in Moscow, with regard to the regions, there is still a place to turn around, but they can be circumvented fairly quickly.  It all depends on turnover, the higher it is, the cheaper it is for you, as the dealer will sell the equipment. <br><br>  PS: <br>  Average cheating per unit of goods from 5 to 30%, depending on the affiliate discount. <br><br>  The article does not have a word about how we solve accounting and other organizational issues on the project, but I considered that this was not necessary, since there is a lot of material on education LLC / IP on Habr√©.  The main thing I have shown is how we in the region ( <s><i>province</i></s> ) organize the work of such a project. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/75832/">https://habr.com/ru/post/75832/</a></p>
