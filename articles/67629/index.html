  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Shoot or read?</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Today, a lot of resources appeared on the photo, including Russian-speaking, which is good news.  You can read there, how to shoot with the wiring, here, how to shoot a wedding, and still there, how to shoot in the dark, without light and a tripod.  If you look for the Russian-language part of the Internet, you will find an article or at least a forum thread on any topic (I give the word) that will answer your question to a certain extent.  But this is also good, but bad is another ... <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  It‚Äôs not at all that a lot of this is written by non-professionals - most professionals don‚Äôt even wait for free exchange of experience (at least in order to gather their audience and sell their services as imperceptibly) with a few and rare exceptions. <br><br>  The bad thing is that by reading the texts online, you can forget what exactly you started it all for.  But the reason was simple - to learn how to shoot, preferably well.

      Once you start searching for information on a specific topic, eventually you creep into terrible jungle, you start asking questions on the forums, what is better and how to replenish information-intelligent channels with meaningless comments, instead of just going out (or even not going out), make a frame and see how the theory agrees with practice.  Or you can spend half a year choosing a camera, make friends with photo forum regulars, subscribe to dozens of blogs about photography, get into the wilds of photo tests, and as a result get only the announcement of a new camera that is better than the one that hung in the last six months on your wish-list , and, as a result, do not buy anything or switch to a new model and replace it with the previous Wishlist. <br><br>  When searching for information, one should not forget that the Internet is not only a means of exchanging information, but also a means of communication, and therefore, one should never forget why you came and what you are looking for, but having done so, leave.  Moreover, remember that crawling across the expanses of the network, no matter how hard you try, do not get practice.  Yes, you can learn a lot on the Internet, but learn only theoretically - practice begins only after separation from the Internet, and you need to train your hands.  No matter how read, do not develop practical shooting skills.  No matter how much you get recommendations on how to get the desired expression from the model, until you start communicating with it, you will not even understand how to undress it.  You can view the entire <a href="http://flickr.com/">Flickr</a> , <a href="http://photosight.ru/">Photosite</a> or even God-forgotten <a href="http://rosbest.ru/">Best Russian photoblog</a> , and never develop an aesthetic sense or critical approach to your own photos - each will seem like a masterpiece. <br><br>  And now think about how much time you spent on the Internet, trying to learn about some kind of shooting technique and how much time did you train in this technique?  The ratio of 1: 1 and above is already good, but if theoretically you comprehended the basics of much more practice, the situation is just critical, especially if after the first few frames you were disappointed and accused the camera of everything.  If you spend more time on getting fairly simple information than on shooting, searching for information actually steals masterpieces from you - after all, nobody can exclude that you have the talent, although only a few are right.  Think about how much time you have wasted, instead of finding an interesting frame.  Have you read about shooting with wiring?  And how many frames were taken then moving cars?  Have you studied the main <a href="http://focused.ru/articles/beginners/camera-modes">shooting modes</a> ?  Why then still shoot on the machine?  Did you twist the zoom ring, as it should, to make a zoom-bang effect?  How many times?  Have you read <a href="http://8020photo.com/">Rodionov</a> ?  Did you use his schemes?  And Sergey gives tasks - did you complete them?  I am sure that most of them simply read and passed by without even having difficulty loading not only their brains, but also their hands. <br><br>  Understand, you can not be a theorist and at the same time be called the proud name "photographer", as you can not be a correspondent boxer.  In principle, no one will say a word to you if you just read, but not to say that you are wasting time, it is impossible, because you cannot simply ‚Äútake interest in photography‚Äù.  Be honest with yourself: if you just read books on photography, blogs on photography, and then discuss the information in forums or blogs, without using in practice, you are a critic (or critic, but this is irrelevant).  If you want to be a photographer, you will have to shoot much more than you read and write, because the photographer is the one who shoots, and photography is an art, first of all, practical. <br><br>  If everything written above caught your attention, perhaps you will listen to a few of our tips, and the art of photography will appear in a different light to you ... <br><br><ul><li>  if you read about some kind of photographic technique, after reading, be sure to spend more time with him on practicing with him than reading, regardless of whether you consider it necessary or not </li><li>  if you choose a camera, do not fool yourself and others: choose two or three models, go to the store and hold everyone in your hands without listening to the seller, buy the most convenient - no need to climb and look at the noise map, a lot of conflicting reviews, all cameras are still the same, and their main goal is to be able to respond to keystrokes </li><li>  the frame is built in the brain, but it turns out after the shutter is released - if you don‚Äôt take pictures, there will be no bad frames (there will be no good ones either, really);  the brain tends to forget even images, and with age more and more </li><li>  When searching the Internet do not confuse the Internet as a means of communication and a source of information </li><li>  participate in free photographers' ideological gatherings (I just want to quote our strobe garbage), go more often to offline </li><li>  don't think that sitting at a computer and enrolling in photo courses will become a good photographer in just ten thousand rubles - they become photographers themselves </li><li>  Do not listen to advice about what you need to shoot "NNN frames per day" - only shoot when an idea arises and implement </li><li>  Carry a camera with you always (in most cases, even a phone is enough), if you‚Äôre big, you can buy a small one in addition </li><li>  look around, notice interesting moments, dependencies, lines, color contrasts, fix everything on the camera, which is always at hand with you </li><li>  Forget everything you read here, put yourself a visual image and just take it off - no book will teach you how to shoot, not to mention blogs </li></ul><br><br>  For the rest, just good luck.  A slightly sharper and more complete version of this article <a href="http://focused.ru/articles/stop-reading/">is here</a> . </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/67629/">https://habr.com/ru/post/67629/</a></p>
