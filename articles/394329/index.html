After they were locked in these wards, Melissa stopped helping him, and Oliver felt that something was going wrong. <br><br>  Once again he tried to fall asleep, because there was absolutely nothing to do here, there was a clap behind the wall, very similar to a shot. <br><br>  ‚ÄúWhat the hell is going on there?‚Äù <br><br>  Oliver suspected that Matt was held somewhere nearby and now he was overwhelmed with bad forebodings.  When the door opened a minute later and Melissa was on the threshold, these presentiments grew into confidence. <br><br>  - Well?  Everything?  - Oliver sat on the bed, holding on to the edge, so as not to show shaking hands. <br><br>  ‚ÄúThere is no time,‚Äù said the woman, ‚Äúput your shoes on, we are leaving.‚Äù <br><br>  Steel General did not expect such a turn.  While he was slowed down, trying to digest what was happening, Matt appeared on the threshold with a gun in his hands. <br><br>  - Oliver, why are you sitting ?!  - The old commander shouted at him, - it's time for us to get out of here!  Melly, - now he turned to the woman, - you can bring us out?  Through the operators? <br><br>  For a moment the woman froze, and then slowly answered the old man: <br><br>  - Commander ... Your brother was right: I can only bring out one of you. <br><br>  ‚ÄúOkay,‚Äù Matt has already made a decision, ‚ÄúOliver,‚Äù lift your ass and get out of here with Melissa, and I'll think of something.  What is the radius of an ordinary operator?  - He asked the woman. <br><br>  - For those that are now in the center, fifty meters.  This is a mind reading.  On the control of twenty meters, - she replied. <br><br>  ‚ÄúOkay,‚Äù Matt nodded contentedly, ‚Äúthen I can keep the defense here at the end of the corridor?‚Äù <br><br>  ‚ÄúTheoretically,‚Äù Melissa replied. <br><br>  ‚ÄúThen get out of here,‚Äù Matt was not in the mood for long goodbyes, ‚Äúget Oliver, Mellie, and find this Richard.‚Äù <br><br>  ‚ÄúListen,‚Äù Oliver stuck into the conversation, who was still sitting on his bed, ‚ÄúI'm not going to leave you here.‚Äù <br><br>  Commander Matthew Harris just grinned. <br><br>  ‚ÄúOllie,‚Äù he almost never called him that, at least for the last twenty years, ‚ÄúI'm an old man.‚Äù  It remains to me not long.  And if at least half of what James told me before knocking out his brains is true, then there will be a lot of work.  And I can‚Äôt even manage half of it - I don‚Äôt live long enough. <br><br>  ‚ÄúWhat kind of James? ..‚Äù Oliver began, but Matt interrupted him. <br><br>  ‚ÄúHelp me, Melly,‚Äù he asked the telepath. <br><br>  Melissa nodded in agreement. <br><br>  ‚ÄúFocus on your conversation, Commander,‚Äù she said, then looked at Oliver and broke into the minds of both, transferring Matt‚Äôs memories to the Steel General. <br><br>  On everything about everything it took no more than seven to ten seconds.  When Melissa finished, Oliver, slightly puzzled, was already fully aware. <br><br>  - And what, you always could?  - He asked Melissa in surprise. <br><br>  - Well yes.  This is not the most desirable procedure, but now we don‚Äôt have time for talking, ‚Äùthe telepath answered.  ‚ÄúCommander,‚Äù the woman continued, already addressing Matt, ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt think you‚Äôll have to stay here.‚Äù  We can go down to the armory, take a couple of trunks, grenades and try to break through with the battle. <br><br>  ‚ÄúWe‚Äôll do that,‚Äù Oliver snapped, stitching up his second shoe, ‚ÄúMellie, we‚Äôll go first, Matt,‚Äù he said to the commander, ‚Äúyou cover.‚Äù <br><br>  After a couple of minutes, all three approached the level guard point.  Ordinary people could not oppose Melissa: they cut down and disarmed a pair of guards without any resistance. <br><br>  - Where to go?  - He asked the woman Oliver, checking whether the captured pistol is loaded. <br><br>  - Elevator.  First to the training level, there are halls, armory and shooting, and then upward. <br><br>  ‚ÄúAre there any stairs at all?‚Äù  ‚ÄúMatt asked,‚Äù I don‚Äôt want to be caught in a trap called the elevator. <br><br>  ‚ÄúWe have this,‚Äù Melissa held up Dr. Ivor‚Äôs key card, ‚Äúshe must have a blocking priority over all the other teams, he is in charge here.‚Äù <br><br>  ‚ÄúYes, really, it would be nice to get its owner,‚Äù said Matt. <br><br>  Melissa thought about something, and then leaned back to the unconscious guard. <br><br>  ‚ÄúGo,‚Äù she said to the men, ‚ÄúI'll catch you up now.‚Äù <br><br>  Melissa did not deceive and returned just at the moment when the elevator arrived on their floor.  She entered the booth first, attached Ivor's key to the reader, and, after receiving confirmation, pressed the button for the required floor. <br><br>  ‚ÄúThere should be costumes,‚Äù she said, ‚ÄúI heard they were used in the Ghetto sweep.‚Äù <br><br>  Matt and Oliver exchanged glances. <br><br>  ‚ÄúAnd please, Oliver,‚Äù added Melissa, ‚Äúthis time do not turn off the combat mode.‚Äù <br><br>  ‚ÄúAha,‚Äù the Steel General muttered in response, ‚ÄúI won't.‚Äù <br><br>  Everything floated before my eyes.  Oliver was as if drunk, disoriented, he had little understanding of where they were going.  Corridors, doors, rooms - everything merged into a single, never-ending tunnel.  Here, all three of them in the armory, dress in combat armor, check the batteries, calibrate suits. <br><br>  - Move, gentlemen, we do not have much time. <br><br>  Matt coped first and was already at the gun stand.  At first his gaze fell on assault rifles, but, having correctly reasoned that he was already too old to run with a heavy barrel at the ready, the old commander reached for his submachine guns. <br><br>  He chose something remotely resembling a modification of the well-known MP7: the same retractable butt, compact when folded, a collimator sight. <br><br>  - Maybe something heavier?  - Melissa asked, which has already completed the calibration of the suit and went to the rack. <br><br>  ‚ÄúThere are corridors everywhere, narrow spaces,‚Äù said Matt, ‚Äúthis,‚Äù he raised his weapon a little higher, ‚Äúwill be much more convenient.‚Äù <br><br>  He once again looked at the armory, looked at the shooting range behind the glass and already thought it was starting to look for shops to his new "friend", but his eyes caught the steel plate at the shooting range. <br><br>  ‚ÄúMelly,‚Äù he turned to the telepath, ‚Äútell me, can it be that Ivor‚Äôs key will not work?‚Äù <br><br>  The woman thought for a moment. <br><br>  ‚ÄúWell,‚Äù she began uncertainly, ‚Äúthe guard can change the protocol and rewrite his account, but this may take a long time.‚Äù <br><br>  - And if you have time?  - asked Matt another suggestive question.  - Will they have time before we get out of this pit? <br><br>  Melissa categorically refused to understand what the old commander was headed for. <br><br>  ‚ÄúCommander Matthew, what do you want? ..‚Äù The woman began, but Matt interrupted her and pointed to the wall of the shooting range. <br><br>  - See the stove? <br><br>  ‚ÄúWell,‚Äù Melissa replied. <br><br>  - And the holes in it?  - Matt asked. <br><br>  Melissa looked closer and noticed the torn holes in the steel plate pointed to by the commander. <br><br>  ‚ÄúStrange,‚Äù the woman replied, ‚Äúthere are only small arms here.‚Äù <br><br>  ‚ÄúWhat do you think,‚Äù continued Matt, ‚Äúthe doors in the center are thicker than this slab?‚Äù <br><br>  The woman thought. <br><br>  ‚ÄúI don't think so,‚Äù she answered. <br><br>  At that moment they were joined by Oliver. <br><br>  ‚ÄúHey, appreciate the new thing,‚Äù said the Steel General and turned his back on his comrades. <br><br>  Looking at Matt and Melissa, the usual form of combat armor appeared, but something was wrong: under the batteries on the blades there were two more empty slots where, apparently, it was possible to fasten additional batteries. <br><br>  - What's this?  Enhanced version?  - Melissa was puzzled. <br><br>  Matt inspected the armory and moved to the shooting range in the same room.  On one of them, directly opposite the plate, which attracted his attention, lay something extremely similar to an anti-tank gun.  But it was something else.  The first difference is that the cannon on the table completely lacked a trunk: instead of it, two parallel, horizontally placed strips with a gap between them, somewhere in a quarter of an inch, predatoryly protruded ahead. <br><br>  Melissa and Oliver who approached him were also surprised by the find. <br><br>  All three of them looked at each other, after which Matt took the strange gun in his hands. <br><br>  - If ideas, what is it?  ‚ÄúHe asked his comrades,‚Äù because I think that those holes over there, ‚Äùhe nodded at the steel plate,‚Äù this ‚Äúbaby‚Äù left. <br><br>  Baby weapons could be called a stretch.  Nearly one and a half meters in length, a large magazine and a butt, a strange double barrel gave the appearance of the gun impressive. <br><br>  - Commander, what is it?  ‚ÄúMelissa poked at Matt‚Äôs shoulder, where there was some kind of alert on the armor control panel. <br><br>  "Incompatible device type" <br><br>  The light red inscription on his shoulder made it clear that the armor of the old commander reacted to the weapon in his hands. <br><br>  ‚ÄúWait, it seems I have an idea,‚Äù Oliver turned and moved back to the stand with the armored suits.  There he took two batteries and returned with them to Melissa. <br><br>  ‚ÄúHitch it,‚Äù he asked the telepath shortly. <br><br>  After Melissa inserted additional batteries into the slots and snapped them in, Oliver reached for the gun in Matt‚Äôs hands. <br><br>  ‚ÄúCome here,‚Äù he told the old commander. <br><br>  As soon as Oliver's palm fell on the handle, the indicator LED on the right side of the gun turned green, as well as the alert on the Steel General's armor. <br><br>  "RSN-04 is ready" <br><br>  What kind of RSN-04?  - Matt was a little puzzled. <br><br>  ‚ÄúWe'll find out now,‚Äù answered Oliver. <br><br>  He unfastened the cannon shop and, to the surprise of all three, inside they saw filled silver blanks, shaped like the letter "P", and not the usual bullets. <br><br>  ‚ÄúYeah,‚Äù said the Steel General, satisfied, ‚ÄúI thought so.‚Äù <br><br>  - And what did you think?  - Matt asked. <br><br>  ‚ÄúThis is a railgun,‚Äù Oliver replied, ‚Äúand I am very surprised that it can be taken off the ground.‚Äù <br><br>  - Is it a type of electromagnetic gun?  - Matt asked. <br><br>  - Not electromagnetic.  She shoots iron bars, Oliver corrected, but very fast blanks. <br><br>  He threw the gun up and aimed at the metal plate.  The lever on the side was transferred to the "AUTO" mode, and the second, the purpose of which Oliver did not know, was in position # 1. <br><br>  The steel general took aim and pressed the trigger.  At that instant, a line of shells burst from the barrel with cotton and flames, which left a row of torn, with a small apple, holes in the plate. <br><br>  ‚ÄúMother of God,‚Äù muttered Matt, ‚Äúdoes this crap shoot bursts?‚Äù <br><br>  ‚ÄúHimself in shock,‚Äù Oliver replied. <br><br>  He was really surprised at how the railgun works.  Having twisted the weapon in his hands, the Steel General shifted the lever from position # 1 to position # 2, from which another indicator caught fire near the store, this time red. <br><br>  Oliver inspected the table on which they found the weapon and picked up one of the stores, in which larger blanks were loaded: by eye comparable to the caliber of a sniper rifle. <br><br>  As soon as he unbuckled the magazine and inserted a new one, the rifle buzzed, and the gap between the trunk rails almost tripled. <br><br>  ‚ÄúC'mon,‚Äù said Melissa, ‚Äúa universal rifle for different calibers?‚Äù <br><br>  ‚ÄúMaybe,‚Äù Oliver replied. <br><br>  The indicator on the side of the railgun, which last time signaled readiness to shoot, was still red.  Oliver reached for the firing mode lever and as soon as he transferred it from ‚ÄúAUTO‚Äù to semi-automatic fire, the weapon reported that it was ready to fire - the LED turned green. <br><br>  Oliver raised his rifle at belt level and again pressed the trigger guard, but nothing happened. <br><br>  - Eh?  - Surprised steel general. <br><br>  - Maybe you need to shoot from the rack, but not from the hip?  - Noticed Melissa. <br><br>  ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs no time to figure it out,‚Äù Matt snapped, ‚Äúthere‚Äôs enough for us that this thing can be in the first mode.‚Äù  Oliver, will you drag? <br><br>  ‚ÄúWell,‚Äù began the Steel General, inserting back the shop with lighter shells and putting the railgun into the first mode, ‚Äúin a suit, then everything is a feather, even myself, so I think I can handle it.‚Äù <br><br>  ‚ÄúOkay,‚Äù Matt nodded, ‚ÄúMelly, take something for yourself and get out of here.‚Äù <br><br>  Matt, without waiting for his comrades, moved to the stand with a weapon and again picked up a modification of the MP7.  In the same place he found himself a belt pouch, in which he put a couple of stores, two EMR and one fragmentation grenade.  For a moment, his gaze lingered on a pistol, from which James committed suicide - the compact Sauer P228, an excellent choice for wearing under clothes.  Matt decided to leave him here, and reached for the usual glock that was commonly used in the government army. <br>  Melissa decided to go light: she took a few grenades, and she preferred a second pistol and additional stores. <br><br>  ‚ÄúAnd I'm ready,‚Äù said Oliver, who was watching the charges. <br><br>  The steel general found on the table two more additional shops with blanks of a smaller caliber, which had already moved to his pouch.  He decided not to change the pistol - the trophy glock, which he removed from the guard, completely satisfied him. <br><br>  ‚ÄúMaybe take something more impressive,‚Äù said Matt to Melissa. <br><br>  ‚ÄúMy main weapon is here,‚Äù the woman tapped her temple with her finger, ‚Äúyou will be shooting, just a little.‚Äù <br><br>  ‚ÄúWell, okay,‚Äù the man agreed, ‚Äúlet's go.‚Äù <br><br>  All three of them moved to the elevators and, like last time, using the Ivor card, they began to climb up to the upper levels without difficulty. <br><br>  ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs strange that there are no sirens or alarms,‚Äù said Oliver. <br><br>  - Why extra noise?  - Matt answered. <br><br>  ‚ÄúWell, yes,‚Äù Oliver agreed, ‚Äúthere is something about that.‚Äù <br><br>  To the surprise of all three at the top, they did not give them a hot reception, quite the contrary - there was not a soul on the surface. <br><br>  ‚ÄúWhat the hell,‚Äù muttered Matt, and intercepted the machine more comfortably, ‚Äúlet's follow me.‚Äù  Melissa - cover up, Oliver, get ready to shoot. <br><br>  ‚ÄúAlways ready,‚Äù snapped the Steel General, ‚Äúnot small.‚Äù <br><br>  Combat armor reduced the load, but he was still weak. <br><br>  ‚ÄúWe need transportation, let's look around.‚Äù  Oliver, take it - Matt handed his pistol to a friend, - maybe it will come in handy.  I don‚Äôt believe this thing to the end. ‚ÄùHe nodded at the railgun in the hands of the Steel General. <br><br>  The top level room was a huge hangar with a checkpoint at the exit.  Here were placed supplies, which were prepared to lower down to the center, fuel supplies for backup generators, furniture, equipment and stuff like that.  However, not a single car was visible on the move: all those found by the fugitives stood without wheels or with open hoods and clearly needed repairs. <br><br>  After ten minutes of inspection, all three gathered together again. <br><br>  - Well?  - First asked Matt. <br><br>  As expected, none of them were unlucky. <br><br>  Matt was already thinking about removing the wheels from one of the trucks and trying to start the one that looked best, but one of the freight elevators was set in motion. <br><br>  ‚ÄúIt seems the guests are coming to us,‚Äù said Oliver. <br><br>  He was right.  The checkpoint also began some movement and as soon as the elevator comes up, all three will be trapped in a vice. <br><br>  ‚ÄúSo,‚Äù Matt began to think through their further actions while there was time, ‚ÄúMellie, how many people are there at the checkpoint?‚Äù <br><br>  - Man five or six, no longer hear. <br><br>  ‚ÄúWe'll deal with them,‚Äù said Matt.  ‚ÄúOliver, will you meet the guests from the elevator?‚Äù  With this toy of yours? <br><br>  ‚ÄúOf course,‚Äù replied the Steel General, ‚Äújust don‚Äôt get too carried away there, I may need help.‚Äù <br><br>  - Do it right.  Come on, Melly, ‚Äùsaid Matt,‚Äú Oliver, as you finish here, walk away to the checkpoint, go on foot. ‚Äù <br><br>  - Good. <br><br>  A couple of seconds later, Matt and Melissa disappeared behind the nearest drawers, and Oliver began to choose a position.  Unfortunately, there was nothing in front of the freight elevator that he could hide behind, so the Steel General just knocked over a couple of boxes, in which, apparently, there was furniture in the parsing, and got behind them. <br><br>  Upstairs he put the railgun, put the butt in his shoulder and checked whether the door was clearly visible. <br><br>  The doors could be seen well. <br><br>  Oliver turned the weapon into semi-automatic mode, three shells per shot and began to wait for the moment when the elevator rises to the floor and it starts to open. <br><br>  ‚ÄúThe width of the opening is ten meters, that is, there can fit about eight people in a row.  If they are with escort, then, rather, will stand "box" for four people.  In any case, it is necessary to beat in the center.  Am I going to the elevator door?  And if you do not ask?  There are guns.  I had to get a grenade from Matt.  Okay, I can handle it. ‚Äù <br><br>  The elevator stopped on the floor and as soon as the doors swayed, Oliver pulled the trigger. <br><br>  Railgun began to spit out blanks, which at great speed were flashing metal elevator doors like paper.  At some point they were stuck, but Oliver was more than enough what he had time to see. <br><br>  Shells fired by weapons in his hands, tore security guards apart.  Even passing through the metal, only slightly slowed down, they, like a deformed steel cloud, crashed into body armor and human flesh.  Torn arms and legs, huge, gaping holes in the chest and stomachs.  Some of the wounded still moaned, quietly settling on the walls, but it was clear that they had only a few minutes left to live - the wounds were too terrible. <br><br>  Oliver pressed the trigger again, but nothing happened.  He still had half a shop, but the indicator on the railgun reported a lack of power, and the armor control panel offered to press the butt to the shoulder to supply additional power to the device. <br><br>  So this is how you work, Oliver thought.  At first, he did not notice the contact pads on the butt and simply decided that these were the costs of the prototype.  Steel General pressed the butt to his shoulder, after which the indicator on the weapon lit up with a familiar green light.  He gave the last turn on the elevator, cutting off the suffering of the wounded, threw the railgun on his shoulder, took out a pistol and moved towards the checkpoint, to Melissa and Matt. <br><br>  Help these two were not needed.  The telepath effortlessly took turns taking control of the guards, taking them out to an open place where Matt had dealt with them with several shots. <br><br>  ‚ÄúThe last one is far, Commander,‚Äù Melissa said just as Oliver approached them, ‚ÄúI myself.‚Äù <br><br>    -   . <br><br> ‚Äî , ‚Äî    ,    , ‚Äî    , ? <br><br>       . <br><br> ¬´  ,   ,     ,   ,    ¬ª. <br><br> ‚Äî  ,    , ‚Äî   . <br><br>      ,    . <br><br> ‚Äî  , ‚Äî  , ‚Äî       . ,      ,    ? <br><br>  . <br><br> ‚Äî     , .          -. ,   - , ‚Äî  . <br><br> ‚Äî , ‚Äî  , ‚Äî    ? <br><br> ‚Äî -  . <br><br> ‚Äî    ? <br><br> ‚Äî   . <br><br> ‚Äî , ‚Äî  , ‚Äî ,     , ? <br><br> ‚Äî    , ‚Äî   , ‚Äî   ,  ,      , ‚Äî    ,    . <br><br> ‚Äî ,    , ‚Äî         . <br><br>      ,  .    ,      ¬´¬ª   ,       ,   ,  . <br><br>   ,    , -      . <br><br> ‚Äî   ? ‚Äì ,    . ‚Äì ?  ? <br><br> ‚Äî , ‚Äî   , ‚Äî  . <br><br>       .     ,      ,   ,   - . <br><br> ¬´,    ¬ª, ‚Äî  . <br><br> ‚Äî ,  ,   ,     , ‚Äî  , ‚Äî , ,  . <br><br>    . <br><br>      ,     ,     - .     ,           . <br><br> ‚Äî           , - . <br><br> ‚Äî  ,   ‚Äî  . <br><br> ‚Äî     . <br><br> ‚Äî , ? <br><br> ‚Äî     ,  ,  ,    , ‚Äî   . <br><br>  . <br><br> ‚Äî ,       ? <br><br> ‚Äî ,  , ‚Äî  , ‚Äî    ,   ,    . <br><br> ‚Äî , ‚Äî  , ‚Äî ,  .   ? ?    , ? ,     ,  . <br><br>       ,     ,        ,    . <br><br>    ,                .    ,       ,    , . <br><br>          . <br><br>    ,      ,   .         . <br><br> ‚Äî , ‚Äî  , ‚Äî ‚Ä¶ <br><br>     ,     ,      ,       . <br><br>         .   ,      ,         .     ,       ,      ,   ,  ,                        . <br><br>  . <br><br> ‚Äî , ‚Äî    , ‚Äî   ,    - . <br><br>     ‚Äì     ,         . <br><br> ,     ,      ,   ,    , ,  ,  -  . <br><br> ‚Äî ,  -? ‚Äì  . <br><br> ‚Äî   - ,       , ‚Äî  . ‚Äî ,  . , ,  . <br><br> ‚Äî , ‚Äî  ,     ,    ,    , ‚Äî      , ? <br><br>        . <br><br> ‚Äî , , ! <br><br>  ** <br><br>    :   ,          ,  ,       .        ,       ,   ,    . <br><br> ¬´      .   ?¬ª, ‚Äî  '.         , ,   ,    . <br><br>         ,          : <br><br> ‚Äî ,   ,      , ? <br><br>    ,     .          ,  ,  ,   -. <br><br>  ,  ,   ,       ,   . <br><br>  ,    . <br><br> ¬´     ¬ª, ‚Äî  , ‚Äî ¬´ ,    ,  ¬ª. <br><br>     ,      ,    ,              .   ,          . <br><br>   ,     ,    ,     ,  . <br><br> ¬´  ?¬ª, ‚Äî    , ‚Äî ¬´    ,     .       ¬ª. <br><br>      .          ,   ,     :        ,      . <br><br> ¬´  .  , ,  !¬ª, ‚Äî  . <br><br>      ,   , ,      . <br><br> ¬´,      ‚Ä¶¬ª, ‚Äî   . <br><br>       ,       , - ,   ,  .       ,   '   ,  ,     . <br><br>  .        ,       -  ‚Äì     . <br><br>           ,  ,  . <br><br> ‚Äî ,  , ? ‚Äî  ', ‚Äî   ,   ‚Ä¶ <br><br> ‚Äî ? ‚Äì  , ‚Äî ?  ? <br><br>    .    -      . <br><br>            .    , , ,      ,      ,   ,   . <br><br> ¬´, ?¬ª, ‚Äî      , ‚Äî ¬´ ¬ª. <br><br>               ,  .      -  ,      ‚Äì    ‚Äì  . <br><br>  ‚Äì  ,    ',         .       ‚Äì      ,      ,          . <br><br> ‚Äî , ‚Ä¶ ‚Äî  ,           . <br><br>  .  ,         ,   ,           ,    ,         . <br><br> ‚Äî ! ‚Äì    , ‚Äî     , , !   ! <br><br>  - What? ‚Äì       ,  , ‚Äî ? <br><br>  - Yes! ‚Äì  , ‚Äî  ,  ,     ! <br><br>   ,    ,  ,  ,      . <br><hr><br><h4>  ,       ,           GT,  ,      ,   VK   ,  <b><a href="http://vk.com/projecteye"> ¬´¬ª</a></b> .
