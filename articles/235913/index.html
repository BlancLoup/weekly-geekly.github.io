Such solutions have existed for a long time, but in the field of CAD, they were used limitedly, because the design software places high demands on the video subsystem of the workstation.  However, at present, there is a real opportunity to create high-performance remote workstations. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/0a2/ceb/997/0a2ceb997bf24b4b90a98e321ad655ca.png"><br><br>  Nanosoft together with <a href="http://www.arbyte.ru/">ARBYTE</a> tested the work of the domestic nanoCAD CAD system on a server virtualization system using <a href="http://www.nvidia.ru/object/grid-vdi-desktop-virtualisation-ru.html">NVIDIA GRID</a> technology.  Such a system allows you to combine several designer jobs in one physical server without loss of video subsystem performance. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  <a href="http://www.nanocad.ru/">nanoCAD</a> is a Russian universal CAD platform containing all the necessary basic design tools.  The familiar interface, direct support for the DWG format and extensibility make nanoCAD the # 1 alternative when choosing a universal platform.

      In the process of testing, we looked for answers to the following questions: <br><ul><li>  What will be the performance? </li><li>  Does it make sense for designers to switch from traditional workstations to virtual workplaces or is it rational only if there are unproductive or outdated machines?  Should I even think about using these technologies? </li></ul><br>  Let's start with the answer to the last question.  Among the main advantages of virtualization are the following: <br><ul><li>  <b>Security</b> - your company's projects do not leave the server.  While working, only the image is transmitted to the workplace - designers can only take a picture of the screen.  Actually it is, of course, for companies with increased security requirements. </li><li>  <b>Distant work</b> - attracting remote employees / freelancers to projects has become a common practice with many companies.  It is more profitable than to look for a person on the spot.  Using a virtualization system, you provide project participants working remotely with a productive workplace, while not sending them the project itself. </li><li>  <b>Ease of use and support</b> - the hardware of the system is located in the server room and is convenient to maintain.  You can connect to the system for work or maintenance from any place where there is a local network or the Internet.  Upgrading the system is quite simple - instead of individually servicing each workstation, it is enough to upgrade the server and configure the virtual machines. </li></ul><br><h4>  Virtualization system </h4>  The system on which the testing was carried out is an ARBYTE software and hardware complex with an infrastructure organized in virtual machines and includes virtual desktops and two servers responsible for connecting and authorizing users.  The work with graphics is provided by the NVIDIA GRID K1 card, which allows you to organize up to 16 virtual desktops.  If necessary, you can install multiple cards, but in the framework of this test, we found it impractical.  The overall performance of the server system varies depending on the organization of disks and the number of simultaneously running virtual machines. <br><br>  The performance of the video subsystem can be improved by replacing the GRID K1 cards with the GRID K2, and the number of workplaces will be reduced, but each virtual machine will be provided with higher graphics performance. <br><br><h4>  What was tested </h4>  The main task was to test the overall performance of nanoCAD under the GRID and see the final performance.  The work was carried out via the Internet, with the creation of a VPN tunnel to the ARBYTE network, and then directly from the local network, in order to eliminate the possible influence of the speed of the channel. <br><br>  nanoCAD, like its foreign counterpart of AutoCAD, uses a single processor core.  Moreover, the higher the frequency of the processor, the faster the program works.  The video card is needed to render the image.  Also in the process of using video memory and, slightly, the video card processor.  An important characteristic is the amount of RAM: the more open a project, the more it is required. <br><br>  The test took place on two laptops, with the results recorded in several versions of the screen resolution.  The built-in performance test in nanoCAD took the FPS value when working under OpenGL and DirectX (nanoCAD allows switching).  Real FPS from laptop screens was also measured.  The test was conducted for the 64-bit and 32-bit versions of the nanoCAD 6, as well as the free version of the nanoCAD 5.1 free. <br><br>  Testing took place using profiles K140Q and K120Q.  The K140Q profile allows you to organize 16 virtual machines on a single GRID K1 card, with 1 GB of video memory being allocated to each VM.  This mode is optimal for CAD users.  The K120Q profile allows you to organize 32 virtual machines on one GRID K2 card, with 512 MB of video memory allocated to each VM.  This profile is more suitable for office users, allowing you to get 2 times higher density of virtual desktops. <br><br><h4>  Speed ‚Äã‚Äãof work in the K120Q and K140Q modes </h4>  First of all, it was necessary to understand whether the mode of operation of the card will matter when working in nanoCAD.  The data presented below is a real FPS. <br><br>  So, look at the graphics that we received when working through the Internet.  You can see that there is no significant difference in the various modes of operation of the NVIDIA card.  However, on the graph with nanoCAD 5.1 free you can see the FPS drop on the K140Q mode.  Most likely, this is due to the decrease at the time of the measurement of the throughput channel in the office, and not some features of the K140Q mode. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/c46/29a/f83/c4629af8381a49d5b719892ab88ed19f.jpg"><br><br>  Now let's analyze the data obtained while working in the local network.  FPS values ‚Äã‚Äãare obtained only for embedded laptop monitors, since we were working ‚Äúon the road‚Äù without stationary monitors.  However, it does not hurt to conclude that there is no significant difference in different modes for nanoCAD. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/f03/3b3/019/f033b3019bb44cba9a87f5accc8e78ee.jpg"><br><br>  Interestingly, in the local network, we got elevated values ‚Äã‚Äãfor a weaker laptop.  But more powerful, on the contrary, showed slightly worse results compared to work via the Internet.  Despite the fact that the average FPS values ‚Äã‚Äãwere taken, it is quite possible that these results are a statistical error.  In addition, the results obtained can confirm the fact that, in this case, the power of the end device is not critical.  The main thing is that it is enough for processing the incoming video stream.  The main work with graphics occurs on the visualization server using its resources. <br><br><h4>  Speed ‚Äã‚Äãof work through the Internet and in a local network </h4>  Now let's see how the remote location of end devices affects the operation.  Compare the average FPS for different versions of the program when organizing work via the Internet and in the local network. <br><br>  The results allow us to conclude that there is no significant difference in the speed of the application.  Only temporary degradation of the connection speed can affect, as you can see above.  Therefore, when organizing remote workplaces, special attention should be paid to ensuring maximum network bandwidth and its ‚Äúresponsiveness‚Äù - this is important for comfortable work. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/a51/f3c/877/a51f3c877bf7445c83d1f984d5cd16a5.jpg"><br><br><h4>  findings </h4>  When working in nanoCAD with large files, for example, a geodatabase or other graphics-rich drawings, you need good hardware resources.  Previously, the need to organize efficient graphics processing was an obstacle to the transfer of designer jobs to the cloud.  However, with the advent of the NVIDIA GRID / Citrix technology bundle, the situation has changed.  Now virtual desktops can combine the advantages of remote access to applications and productive graphics.  This allows you to comfortably work with a remote server from anywhere and from any end devices - laptops, tablets, smartphones. <br><br>  In terms of performance, such a solution will not yield to the ‚Äútraditional‚Äù workplace, and, depending on the server configuration, it may show even better results.  As an example, below you can see a comparison of the results of work on the same laptop of the basic configuration using its own resources and when organizing work in the cloud. <br><br>  From the side it may seem that in general the programs work approximately equally.  But in reality, when using a laptop to work in a virtualized environment, you can notice a significant increase in the smoothness of operations and overall performance. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/O1y_K0brRJY%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700021,15700186,15700190,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhitjzP7puEhqIoyEbTzEkH0j7n_3g" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  As can be seen from the graphs, changing the profile used does not affect the performance of the workplace, which allows you to organize servers with high density of workplaces.  However, NVIDIA recommends using the K140Q profile for working with CAD systems, which ensures optimal system performance in the cloud for this type of application.  It makes no sense to use more expensive GRID K2 cards - they support a smaller number of users, but do not give a significant performance boost. <br><br>  Do not think that the cloud solution for the price will be inferior to the traditional, using fixed graphic stations.  At best, both solutions will be comparable in price (assuming the maximum use of virtualization capabilities).  However, workspace virtualization has other advantages - ensuring data security and ease of upgrading and maintenance. <br><br>  <b>Alexander Osmyakov, Product Manager, nanoCAD, <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/users/isv/" class="user_link">isv</a> , <a href="http://www.nanocad.ru/">Nanosoft</a></b> <b><br></b>  <b>Dmitry Yakunin, Head of CAD, <a href="http://www.arbyte.ru/">ARBYTE</a></b> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/235913/">https://habr.com/ru/post/235913/</a></p>
