I have been using the phone myself for 10 months and I want to say that I am very pleased with it.  I would like to share with you the impression of your ‚ÄúRadare‚Äù.  To tell about various and interesting applications, how they work and how, after all, Windows Phone 7.8 is good for its interface. <br><br><h2>  <b><i>First, let's talk about the menu!</i></b> </h2><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/86a/50b/8f0/86a50b8f03d7bb939f36c0bb76ace861.jpg" alt="image"><br>  Initially, the phone was on the Windows Phone 7.5 Mango platform, I want to note that there was no opportunity to change the menu as such, which cannot be said about version 7.8.  Here you can dream as you like: increase, decrease and stretch the tiles.  And what else has appeared is more bright and very colorful colors for ‚Äúfavorite‚Äù tiles.  In general, with the advent of the Windows Phone 7.8 platform, the menu has changed a lot. <br><br>  It is also very convenient to find programs in your phone, they are in alphabetical order and there is a search engine that will easily find the program you need. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/dc2/172/03e/dc217203e17d40015c165469a5f530da.jpg" alt="image"><br><h2>  <b><i>Now let's talk about the connection!</i></b> </h2><br><br>  I am pleased with her, supports 3G, MMS, SMS, mail, various chat rooms, SMS applications, in general, everything is as it should be! Recently I downloaded several applications for funny and interesting SMS messages. <br><br><h2>  <b><i>SMS application FREE!</i></b> </h2><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/d6c/195/cf8/d6c195cf895746460543c83f97080330.jpg" alt="image"><br>  I can not help but notice that it is very colorful and performs many different and interesting commands: <br><br>  <u>1. Inverted text</u> - that is, you enter any message and it turns it over.  To be honest, I don‚Äôt know why and for whom it is intended, just in my opinion, to indulge. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/01f/357/0a7/01f3570a74946a4253f9a27866de635a.jpg" alt="image"><br>  <u>2. ART generator</u> - you enter any word, and it paints you beautifully.  It turns out very nice. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/e8d/dd1/9c1/e8ddd19c1c4f096d8a8ade29f61e490e.jpg" alt="image"><br>  <u>3. A creative studio</u> is the same as a symbol table, which can be found in any computer. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/68c/de0/d84/68cde0d848bc7a1e6a83d67ef5f5a754.jpg" alt="image"><br>  <u>4. Congratulatory tests</u> for all occasions, however, everything is in English. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/2a6/443/b9b/2a6443b9bdbef85054b2801f62d921fc.jpg" alt="image"><br>  <u>5. ART drawings</u> on different themes, drawn by symbols. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/c52/a54/f27/c52a54f270f3abfe04e5769bd791b4de.jpg" alt="image"><br><h2>  <b><i>The application "I'm going to write!"</i></b> </h2><br><br>  I want to note that the application is very convenient.  I think the situation is familiar to many: we receive a message during a walk and want to respond to the message, but since we do not look down, we often stumble and swear at ourselves.  This application, I would even say wonderful, you go, write and see what's under your feet. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/3a2/a76/526/3a2a76526d747820224a0610ee8ec08d.jpg" alt="image"><br>  Here are two very good applications, I think they will interest you too!  Now I would like to say <b><u>about the Internet:</u></b> many different convenient browsers, but some are not very happy that there is no opera on the official firmware.  I can not agree with their dissatisfaction, to be honest, I see no reason to use Opera when the phone has Internet Explorer 9. Very convenient and fast, and I don‚Äôt think that other browsers need to be downloaded. But I can say that you can download browsers to your taste. market.  There are a lot of them, from different manufacturers.  I'll show the most famous favorite Internet Explorer 9, and Mozila Firefox: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/ab7/371/4f6/ab73714f66e2993f1d41e2a7a02e17f7.jpg" alt="image"><br>  For fans of <u><b>social networking</b></u> applications just a lot.  You can walk so that you get tired of determining which application all the same to sit on VKontakte or in classmates, twitter.  Here are some of them: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/3e6/0d1/b0b/3e60d1b0be7cb9837e34d86506e3be74.jpg" alt="image"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/bd8/ce3/4d7/bd8ce34d7b3946d43fe1dfbef5e8b83c.jpg" alt="image"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/345/760/52c/34576052ccf097f7d5d1aa293b30d8f7.jpg" alt="image"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/623/9f0/fcf/6239f0fcfed38ff3c7924fc92d855042.jpg" alt="image"><br>  But for those who like to sit in <b><u>instagrame</u></b> on Windows Phone 7.8, the occupation is not the most attractive, there are applications, but in my opinion they are very inconvenient.  Then the photos are not loaded, then in general you are thrown out of the application, as they are unofficial. I think it's enough about the connection. <br><br>  Now I want to show what is in the phone itself. <br><br>  I'll start with the <b><u>Music</u></b> app <b><u>.</u></b> <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/fe3/3d0/c27/fe33d0c2728821bba8ab1fb78c986de9.jpg" alt="image"><br>  Here, all your songs are in alphabetical order, which in my opinion is very convenient, you can create playlists, but only with the help of the Zune program.  Although initially, the program itself seemed very uncomfortable to me, with the help of it, you can throw music, photos and video onto your phone.  As for the ringing tone, there are a lot of them in the phone, but you can also put your own, but first you need to cut the song up to 30 seconds, and then drop it into the program and indicate that it is a ringtone, and then you can only go to the phone. <br><br>  When buying a phone, I didn‚Äôt like it very much - as I can‚Äôt put my favorite song in its entirety, but over time you realize that this is not so important, because when you call, the whole song does not play, and I thought that It is very convenient to choose your favorite moment and put it on the bell. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/28a/eaf/2a8/28aeaf2a8b5e0ee124cf8515ccfb2665.jpg" alt="image"><br>  The cameras on the phone are wonderful, both main and front.  There are 2 flashes, one turns on, as well as at night, and in the afternoon.  But the second works only at night. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/fc3/371/d11/fc3371d11aa426bd7db50e9749f465f8.jpg" alt="image"><br>  Video camera shoots at 720r.  The clarity is very good, in the evening you can turn on the lantern to capture the sky or just some good event. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/2d6/aac/1cf/2d6aac1cf86bf418199c406dadd7a404.jpg" alt="image"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/4ce/bb4/64b/4cebb464b03cefad7f392d3b60fb92c9.jpg" alt="image"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/49b/58e/32e/49b58e32e5c0701566623a3fdd7f2fb8.jpg" alt="image"><br>  I can not tell you about the game Xbox.  The graphics are great, there are so many different games.  You can create your character and play online. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/f0e/cdb/647/f0ecdb64794658d0521a777d30b1b59a.jpg" alt="image"><br>  For those who like to read, there is an office in the phone, it‚Äôs very good and convenient that it exists.  You can download books and read directly on your phone in different formats, not only in doc. There is also Sky Drive storage where you can store not only documents, but also photos.  It is convenient that it will never be removed from it. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/328/c87/0fe/328c870fe62fa722cb3b9456c611ece2.jpg" alt="image"><br>  <b><u>Applications that are in the phone:</u></b> <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/486/f32/19b/486f3219bec993a81fc66a589061e5fe.jpg" alt="image"><br>  <u><b>Settings</b></u> <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/f9a/a42/f58/f9aa42f58d3066fc7a92e141905f0a50.jpg" alt="image"><br>  The phone has a very convenient taskbar. <br><br>  When you are viewing one application, but you urgently need to look at, say, mail, but you don‚Äôt want to exit the application, simply press the menu button and look at the mail.  Then, to return back to the application, you must hold the back arrow and this taskbar will appear, as shown below, that is, your session of active applications will be saved, and you can safely return to it. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/317/6bf/ed7/3176bfed7bee0199d8fb027ec4e9465d.jpg" alt="image"><br>  On this beautiful note I want to finish my article.  This phone has a lot of different applications, you can talk about them day and night.  I think about the most important thing, I told.  I hope you enjoyed my article! <br></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/191314/">https://habr.com/ru/post/191314/</a></p>
