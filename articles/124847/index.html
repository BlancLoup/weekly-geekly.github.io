  <section class="page js-page"><h1>More tools to improve the management of the organization!</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  The new version 1.5.5.0 of the <b>‚ÄúSimple Business‚Äù</b> software product ( <a href="http://www.prostoy.ru/">http://www.prostoy.ru</a> ) has added another useful feature that will turn the process of planning projects and tasks into ‚Äúcreativity‚Äù and allow you to visually evaluate the results of your work.  It is well known that the graphical presentation of data greatly facilitates the possibility of their perception and analysis.  It is for this purpose that the ‚ÄúGant‚Äù tab has been added to the window of each project, on which it is possible to plan projects using the Gantt chart.  <b>A Gantt chart</b> is a popular type of bar chart that is used to illustrate a plan or schedule of work for a project by displaying tasks as segments on a timeline. <br><a name="habracut"></a><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/2a1/49c/b5f/2a149cb5fb6657ac679f503eb8083246.png" alt="image"><br>  In the left part of the ‚ÄúGant‚Äù window there are three tabs ‚ÄúTasks‚Äù, ‚ÄúResponsible‚Äù and ‚ÄúResources‚Äù, with which you can get various options for constructing a diagram in the context of tasks, resources and employees responsible for project execution. <br>  The ‚ÄúTasks‚Äù tab window consists of two parts: in the left part of the window there is a list of tasks included in the project, decorated in the form of a table.  For each of the tasks in the table indicates the name, priority, time interval and mark of execution. <br>  The right part of the window is occupied by a diagram showing the relationship between the execution of tasks and the timeline.  The following symbols are used in the diagram: the green color of the segment indicates the completed task, the red segment represents the task of increased importance.  Lilac color indicates tasks that are not completed on time.  The arrows schematically show the structure of the subordination of tasks to each other. <br><br>  If it is necessary to obtain information about the tasks performed in the context of responsible persons, you need to choose for consideration the ‚ÄúResponsible‚Äù tab.  In the left part of the window there will be a table listing the employees of the organization and the tasks assigned to each for execution within the specified time frame.  In the right part of the window, each task is assigned its graphical image. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/b83/df3/f6c/b83df3f6c7424cee0a52b947403d2490.png" alt="image"><br>  The ‚ÄúResources‚Äù tab is designed to provide information on the total costs of the project, including decoding for each individual task.  The lower part of the window reflects the total cost of the project, and the diagram in the adopted symbols can clearly see the cost of each resource - payment for work and services, the cost of consumables, etc. <br>  Due to the visual presentation of data on the Gantt chart, the user can easily assess the sequence and duration of tasks, the length of the project as a whole, compare and analyze in detail the planned and actual process of performing tasks. <br>  For users of the program "Simple Business", with administrative rights of the program or the owner of the organization, the possibility of <b>detailed configuration of telephone gateways</b> has become available <b>.</b> <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/80c/c9c/636/80cc9c63659726469267e1ca53330127.png" alt="image"><br>  To use this function, you need to select the tab "Telephony" in the main information window of the organization.  Using the ‚ÄúNew Gateway‚Äù command, it is possible to add a new telephone connection for communication by defining its basic settings.  For example, specify the server address, account settings, fill in the list of connected phone numbers.  It is also possible to describe the rules for processing an incoming call - the time of the connection or the person in charge, or add a voice menu to the new gateway. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/c50/03c/fce/c5003cfce70e005cdf58bba6f1a94be1.png" alt="image"><br>  The access parameters of the organization‚Äôs employees to incoming calls are determined by the owner of the organization or the administrator on the ‚ÄúAccess to outgoing‚Äù tab by setting the appropriate flags in the list of company employees. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/784/c62/e18/784c62e180291c5a8be26c9215ba77b3.png" alt="image"><br>  To define the connection parameters in more detail, you can use the ‚ÄúAdd a rule‚Äù command - and in the window that appears, set the time parameters for incoming calls and edit the list of employees responsible for receiving them. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/c09/0b6/774/c090b6774e8d15faada1e458b3e68188.png" alt="image"><br>  The ‚ÄúAdd menu item‚Äù command gives an organization administrator a wonderful opportunity to add an operator voice menu to the gateway.  The voice menu is designed to optimize the process of communication - using the operator's prompting system, you can quickly connect with the desired service or department of the organization. <br><br>  To connect with a specific user of the ‚ÄúSimple Business‚Äù program, a function for connecting an extension number has been added, which is assigned to each user of the program and is indicated in his profile.  Now, when connecting to an organization, it is enough to simply dial the extension number of the desired user to connect to it as quickly as possible.

      The help system of the ‚ÄúSimple Business‚Äù program in the new version has been enlarged with the function <b>‚ÄúQuestion for technical support of Simple. Ru‚Äù.</b>  If a critical situation occurs - a problem or malfunction of the program, or questions that the help system could not resolve, the user can send a technical support specialist a message containing a question or state his problem, if necessary, attach a file to the message (error screenshot).  The chronology of communication with the technical support service is stored on the ‚ÄúCorrespondence‚Äù tab. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/856/020/626/856020626b594739a375b754f987cde4.jpg" alt="image"><habracut><br><br>  <b>Take advantage of the new features of the ‚ÄúSimple Business‚Äù program, and you will be able to appreciate their contribution to the optimization of problem solving, synchronization and streamlining of current business processes in your organization!</b> </habracut></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/124847/">https://habr.com/ru/post/124847/</a></p>
