      Currently, operational tests of the Spencer robot are being conducted at Amsterdam Schiphol Airport.  They say that he will go beyond the skills of the robots of the current generation. <br><br>  Not so long ago, robotics and artificial intelligence (AI) were viewed as wild futuristic ideas, but they are developing at a rapid pace.  2016 promises to be a landmark for these two technologies in the tourism sector. <br><br>  Terminal-oriented customer service robots are not a new trend.  Back in 2013, the Geneva airport launched its first such experiment, and last year similar projects launched the airports of Haneda and Auckland, where robots carried out work on the transport of baggage and cleaning the territory. <br><br>  At the end of 2015, KLM launched a revolutionary Spencer project at Schiphol Airport.  They say that Spencer will go beyond the skills of the robots of the current generation.  He is able to guide groups of passengers directly to the gate.  It is assumed that Spencer will be able to recognize emotions, analyze group behavior and actively respond to unexpected situations, potentially providing service to customers and passengers of the new generation. <br><br>  At the Consumer Electronics Show (CES) in Las Vegas, robotics was a hot topic (Aldebaran, for example, introduced Pepper, a humanoid robot who is able to communicate with people, recognize them, read and react to their emotions), which once again underlines the fact that the robotic revolution is under way.  If Spencer is a successful experiment and will have a positive impact on the quality of customer service in Amsterdam, other airlines and airports will certainly want to follow suit. <br><br>  The UAE is among those countries that have already declared their intention to explore the possibilities of robotics as part of a major technology transformation initiative, also covering the study of the role of AI in the future.  Etihad, a carrier from the Middle East, recently made a $ 700 million deal with IBM, which implies using IBM Watson, demonstrating the value that cognitive technologies offer airlines. <br><br>  The future importance of AI in the travel and transportation industry is obvious, so the air transport industry must be prepared to use its advantages and robotics to improve operations and passenger services. <br><br><br><h1>  Data processing and analysis </h1><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/3d1/a86/154/3d1a86154b2300001681aef8357e2273.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  ‚ÄúBig data‚Äù has been a popular term for airlines and airports for several years.  Industry continues to make efforts to harness the opportunities provided by the extensive data pools and big data tools at their disposal.  So a consequence - the processing and analysis of information are currently in the spotlight.  The role of specialists in this field is growing in the air transport sector. <br><br>  So what is a specialist in data processing and analysis?  According to IBM, it differs in comparison with other strong business qualities, which it combines with the ability to convey conclusions to both business people and IT managers in such a way that they can influence the approach of organizations to business rivalry. <br><br>  Good data processing and analysis specialists will not take on solving only business problems, they choose the right problems that have the greatest value for the organization.  Anjul Bambri, vice president of Big Data Products at IBM, adds: ‚ÄúA data processing and analysis specialist is a curious person who can observe data and highlight trends.  It‚Äôs almost like a Renaissance man who really wants to learn and make changes to the organization. ‚Äù <br><br>  The above projects, which are working on in the UAE and Etihad, focus on data processing and analysis.  At the same time, the low-cost airline EasyJet recently appointed its first manager for its data processing and analysis department.  ‚ÄúDue to the huge potential of AI, as well as speeding up the processing and analysis of data in the airline industry, our efficiency improves, costs decrease, revenues increase and greater customer satisfaction is promoted,‚Äù the airline said.  2016 may well be the year of a specialist in data processing and analysis. <br><br><br><h1>  Self-service with support for biometric devices </h1><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/122/3e5/155/1223e5155afeed392c01e900ebe6834d.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Check-in and check-in facilities can now be found at airports around the world, but with the advent of a new generation of products on the market, biometric technologies seem to play a decisive role in creating the next level of security and more comfortable passenger service.  The best example of this trend can be found at Auckland Airport, where <a href="http://www.airnewzealand.com/gateway">Air New Zealand</a> recently installed the first of 13 biometric self-service points for express baggage that are equipped with an integrated camera to take pictures of a passenger‚Äôs face. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/615/205/a7a/615205a7a8636bd4e11af60774977205.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  A number of suppliers in this area are eyeing the integration of biometric technologies as the next wave of self-service products; moreover, many see them as an essential element that will help improve passenger services at airports. <br><br>  This is in line with the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãcreating a single passenger pass (such as Aruba Happy Flow), which can link passenger biometric data with their boarding pass and passport to eliminate the need to provide documents at several stages.  As airports, airlines and suppliers now see the benefits of biometric self-service solutions, we can expect that we will see several of them in the next 12 months. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/-4ld0zonEEE%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700021,15700186,15700190,15700248,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhgcvALvSGz36RMrTohTAiZq6jF1Aw" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br><br><br><h1>  Smart baggage solutions </h1><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/cdf/69c/88c/cdf69c88c1c3f2ebfb4f7775822f09e2.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Smart baggage solutions, such as the RIMOWA e-tag, which was launched at FTE Global 2015, laid the foundations for the baggage revolution. <br><br>  Baggage points with the support of biometric devices will not be the only innovation in this sector in 2016.  Last year was outstanding for baggage thanks to the joint launch <a href="http://www.rimowa.com/">by RIMOWA</a> and Lufthansa of the RIMOWA e-tag. <br><br>  KLM is introducing similar devices for tracking the baggage of regular passengers, and several suppliers are improving their permanent electronic tags on baggage, thereby trying to take their place in this fast-growing market.  Thus, the foundation is laid for the reconstruction of the luggage delivery process. <br><br>  Various airlines are exploring the possibility of introducing electronic tags for baggage.  Among them are British Airways, Air France-KLM, Air New Zealand and Brussels Airlines.  As more and more developed solutions appear on the market, the probability of their implementation increases.  Back in August, one of the industry insiders stated with confidence that e-tags will appear within a year, and we would not doubt it. <br><br><br><h1>  Empowering passengers </h1><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/264/d51/648/264d516489d4580d47b222c3e74b7a58.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  All of the above is a major trend: the empowerment of passengers.  Robotics has the potential to introduce a new level of customer service and reduce concerns at airport terminals.  Artificial intelligence, as well as data analysis and processing, can help airlines and airports gain tangible benefits from the multitude of information to which they have access.  Self-service solutions that support biometric devices can provide travelers with a more comfortable stay at airports.  And smart baggage solutions will allow passengers to take control of the process of moving their baggage (including the ability to track it at each stage of the journey). <br><br>  The modern traveler wants to have greater rights and powers, does not want to worry while waiting and flying, and expects to receive a more comfortable and personalized travel experience.  The technologies listed in this article can help airlines and airports meet these requirements. <br></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/390447/">https://habr.com/ru/post/390447/</a></p>
