  <section class="page js-page"><h1>DDoS attacks and protection against them - how much does it cost Russian companies?</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Our company, among other services, provides professional protection against DDoS attacks of high complexity.  In order to provide such protection, we try to keep track of the latest news and monitor the success of various companies in creating new methods to counter DDoS attacks. <br><br>  And now there is something to counteract.  After all, only last week, the attackers organized several powerful attacks from which both companies and individuals suffered. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  One of the first victims was journalist Brian Krebs.  An attack with a capacity of 620 Gbit / s was rendered to its site.  Even Akamai, which has defended the Krebs blog for four years, failed to cope with this.  The most interesting thing is that the attack was carried out with the help of low-power connected devices from the world of the ‚ÄúInternet of things‚Äù.  It was possible to stop this outrage only with the help of Google and its Project Shield service. <br><br>  An even more powerful attack was carried out on the hosting provider OVH.  Here the power of DDoS reached 1 Tb / s.  During this attack, more than 152,000 IoT gadgets were involved.  The attackers carried out an attack using tcp / ack, tcp / ack + psh and tcp / syn.

Here the saying ‚Äúagainst scrap is no reception‚Äù is relevant.  But still, most DDoS attacks are much less powerful, and there are many more such attacks. <br><br>  Russian companies, at least overseas, face DDoS, and many prefer to protect themselves even before an attack occurs.  The interests of clients from the Russian Federation are provided by a number of companies, including us.  Three quarters of the DDoS protection services on the market are provided by Qrator Labs, Kaspersky Lab and Rostelecom. <br><br>  The volume of the Russian DDoS protection market, according to the IDC survey, amounted to $ 16.34 million. By this indicator, 2016 is ahead of 2014 by 25.4% in dollars and by 34.7% in rubles. <br><br>  The market for DDoS protection services is growing due to the growing complexity and frequency of attacks of this type, as mentioned above.  DDoS can have very unpleasant consequences for companies of any scale, because such an attack simply stops doing business for a while. <br><br>  True, Russian companies are not ‚Äúattacked‚Äù as often as Chinese ones.  It is China that accounts for the lion‚Äôs share of all DDoS attacks - as much as 77%.  Russia is in sixth place by the recipient of attacks of this type.  The Russian Federation accounts for only 0.6% of all cases.  But already by this indicator, as the number of command servers from which DDoS attacks are made, Russia is already in fourth place.  About 4.5% of this type of servers are located in the country.  The largest number of managing servers in South Korea is about 70%. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/87d/a7f/a2a/87da7fa2ae1096653b4e03a77994eed4.png" width="800"><br><br>  The duration of DDoS attacks, according to Kaspersky Lab experts, is constantly growing.  Even this year, this figure increased in the 2nd quarter compared to the 1st.  And it has increased significantly, since the number of attacks lasting from 50 to 90 hours has increased about four times.  The number of attacks lasting from 20 to 49 hours has doubled.  The duration of the longest attack in 2016 is 291 hours. <br><br>  Another interesting fact is that there is now a preponderance of Linux-botnets compared to Windows-botnets. <br><br>  As for <a href="https://www.king-servers.com/servers/antiddos/">our company</a> , we use multi-level cleaning - filtering based on routing, hardware firewall and other hardware.  The system can withstand a DDoS attack up to 100Gbps +, depending on the type of attack.  We do not use third-party filtering - that is why our filters are among the fastest in the European market.  For this reason, it is the best solution for corporate clouds, telecommunications, low latency VOIP, gaming server and other IT infrastructures. <br><br>  Moreover, it is very easy to integrate our DDoS protection.  You can choose different traffic passing methods - GRE, cross connect, VLAN, etc.  The filter works in in-line and out of path modes, thanks to this, we can configure cleaning only incoming traffic, while outgoing traffic can go in the usual way. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/311556/">https://habr.com/ru/post/311556/</a></p>
