  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Amazon Appstore revenue per user exceeds Google Play and Apple App Store revenue</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  TinyCo, a mobile games development startup created with the support of Andressen Horowitz, became another developer who said that the revenue earned from one user in the Amazon Appstore is much higher than the revenue earned on Google Play. <br><br>  The company that created the top 25 most profitable games for both iOS and Android analyzed data from its <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details%3Fid%3Dcom.tinyco.village">Tiny Village</a> , a farm game on a prehistoric theme, available in all three stores from Google, Apple and Amazon, and came to the conclusion that, if we take into account the platform, the Amazon store brings 80% more profit per user than iTunes.  If we consider only the segment of games for tablets, then Amazon Kindles brings in 43% more profit from the user than the iPad does.  So, according to their data, Amazon sells even more successfully than Apple. <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  However, things are not so bad for Google Play.  TinyCo's profits on it are not so bad.  If you look at the data only on Android phones (which exclude all Amazon devices, since they do not offer phones), these devices give 82% percent of profits compared to the income from one user from iPhone.

      It can be said that the conclusions are made on the basis of a single statement of a specific developer, and therefore they do not reflect the general situation in the market.  But TinyCo is one of several dozen game developers who are in the profitability ratings of all three stores.  The Amazon market is still small, the possibility of monetization of applications appeared on it only a couple of weeks ago, having left the beta testing mode, so that while few developers managed to get meaningful data on ARPU (average revenue per user). <br><br>  But a more complete picture.  TinyCo figures are slightly different from recent data from analyst firm Flurry, which reviewed the range of applications available in all three stores.  Flurry <a href="http://apps4all.ru/news/applications/app-revenue.html">found</a> that the $ 1 million in revenue from the iOS store accounted for $ 0.89 million on Amazon and $ 0.23 million earned on Google Play.  Flurry analyzed more than 150,000 applications, so their sample was quite representative. <br><br>  Another major independent developer a few weeks ago also shared some promising statistics with the Amazon Appstore.  Storm8 said the company earned $ 700,000 in profit for the first month on the Amazon market. <br><br>  However, there are a couple of things to think about, based on data from Amazon. <br><br><ol><li>  Google doesn‚Äôt have Amazon‚Äôs many years of experience in making payments and managing an e-profit model. </li><li>  They do not have a credit card database from Amazon and Apple, which creates additional difficulties for customers - when they want to make a payment, they have to manually enter all their personal data. </li><li>  Amazon Kindle tablets are relatively new to the market, so high revenues per user are associated with consumer curiosity.  Over time, when the device enters the mainstream, revenues from it will decrease, as is usually the case with devices or platforms. </li><li>  Amazon Appstore is still available only for US consumers.  So iTunes and Google Play numbers are averaged at the expense of less profitable international markets. </li></ol><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/908/5a7/f44/9085a7f44b7c456f35af2985af80d6e6.png" alt="image"></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/142641/">https://habr.com/ru/post/142641/</a></p>
