  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Who is the project manager according to the business owner and how to deal with it</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  I would like to talk about what today in Russia is meant by project management and what, according to many, is the role of the project manager. <br><br>  Colleagues know that in our country there are certain discrepancies on this subject and some actively carry the right understanding to the masses, others have given up trying and pupated in their cozy little world, while others, unfortunately thinking that they are engaged in project management, will now find that it is not So. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  To understand the depth of error, it is enough to open any website with vacancies and type in the search engine the phrase "project manager".  What do you think will be the most vacancies?  That's right - job sellers.  Project managers for sales, project sales managers, project managers with customer search, cold calling and so on.  And it would be nice if this is just such a specific business in which you are given a chair, table and telephone, determine the industry and offer to find a customer for the project for yourself, and then everything else, including resources for its execution.  In this sense, it will, of course, be a project activity, however, more often it is just a matter of unformalized sales and order execution processes. <br><br>  Perhaps these are links of one chain with well-known sales managers, which we still have in many stores instead of sellers, but in my opinion, this is the result of a deep misunderstanding on the part of managers and business owners about what projects are, who they are for and what directs what competences should be possessed and how it all differs from ordinary operations (moreover, that such operations are also often not known - for them the company just does something, people there do something and everything else  buzzwords and other HYIP).

      Probably for the same reason, many companies call projects.  Total at any event, you can easily hear something like: ‚ÄúI have a new project in the beauty industry - opened the salon in a brisk place - do you have some sensible girl on the project manager, well, so that at the reception and for the masters watched and ordered materials on time? ‚Äù <br><br>  I do not in any way belittle the role of a specialist here and do not stick out the role of a project manager.  A team of programmers without a manager is likely to create a product (even if it will be longer, more expensive and not always what the customer wanted), but the project manager cannot do it without a team.  In this sense, the labor market has long since placed everything about places and the salary of a programmer (a member of a project team) is often higher than the salary of a project manager. <br><br>  I just say that all people are different and a good specialist may not grow into a manager (including projects), and a good project manager is unlikely to be as good as, for example, an analyst or information system architect. <br><br>  The business owner often hires a RP, tells him about his ideas and begins to wait for the result.  After some time, the PM comes with a draft of the project charter and wonders where the team is, since it would be necessary to discuss the structure of the work, make schedules, identify and evaluate the risks.  And then he hears: ‚ÄúWell, you decide to do it yourself, do not distract people, then people will, by the way, here‚Äôs another idea - to search the market ‚Äî give me a certificate of possible options, pros and cons.‚Äù  RP is, at best, an analyst. <br><br>  As a result, projects are often confused with processes, and project managers with specialists or operational managers.  Why call?  Call things by their proper names, and for this read the materiel - take it up and read how it would look scary PMBOK, PRINCE2 Manual, go on courses on introducing a couple of lighter femvorov types like P3Express, Kanban and, on occasion, prompt in a relaxed friendly conversation familiar business owner what is what.  You look, after a while we will see positive changes in the mass consciousness. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/441832/">https://habr.com/ru/post/441832/</a></p>
