      A short "summary" of the work done under the cut <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br><h4>  Deliverance </h4><br>  Well, first we will try to get rid of this gay porn. <br><ul><li>  Reboot into Safemode.  It is still hanging. </li><li>  I call the Task Manager with a quick movement of the hand (for some reason it hasn‚Äôt been blocked yet, and thank God) and sharply click to delete the current task - yes. </li><li>  Succeeded.  Now we start msconfig and we take away from autorun 0.07209009531421795.exe </li><li>  We are overloaded for the 2nd time - blocking again (see that there is an infection somewhere else).  This time it was not possible to delete it via the task manager. </li><li>  Reboot for the 3rd time.  But now we press Ctrl + Alt + Del immediately after the message that ‚ÄúNow Windows is working in safe mode‚Äù appears and launch the explorer. </li><li>  Find that file and rename it. </li><li>  Overload.  Voila </li></ul><br>  One word invested in 10min. <br>  By the way, Avast 4.8 Home Edition stands on that system.  Of course, I didn‚Äôt have much hope for him, but still threw him on that file.  As expected - he did not show anything. <br>  Here the excitement has already turned on and decided to check with all available antiviruses, as well as add a new sample. <br>  But first things first <br><br><h4>  Avast </h4><br>  Since it was already found out that this virus is not listed in Avast, I started sending them a copy to the laboratory.  Unfortunately, the site does not have a form for automatic sending for analysis and an online scanner. <br>  Having rummaged through Google, I found out that the samples are sent to virus@avast.com with a password-protected archive with a password embedded in the text. <br><br><h4>  Dr.Web </h4><br>  Dr.Web - very pleased in all plans.  Although his CureIt and later online scanner did not detect the threat, it made it easy to add a sample.  Everything was quite logical and fast. <br><br><h4>  Kaspersky </h4><br>  Grieved.  Any Google search for the phrase ‚ÄúKaspersky online scanner‚Äù led to the site <a href="http://www.kaspersky.ru/virusscanner">www.kaspersky.ru/virusscanner</a> where it wasn‚Äôt.  There was only a set of utilities that were offered to download, install and then something to do with them. <br>  Fortunately, an online form was immediately found to send the sample to the laboratory, which was immediately done. <br><br><h4>  results </h4><br>  The results were also a little surprised, although if we analyze all the above, they were logical. <br><ul><li>  Avast - email sent with confirmation of delivery.  But all is quiet.  The answer did not come.  but after 24 hours with a new base virus is detected as Win32: Rootkit-gen [Rtk] </li><li>  Dr.Web - immediately after filling out and submitting the form, an email was received so that the file is being processed, and after ~ 4 hours a notification that the sample was added to the database called Trojan.Winlock.3256 </li><li>  Kaspersky - after the submission a letter came that the file was being processed and nothing else. <br>  After 24 hours, I tried the Kaspersky server with the databases from 11/17/2011 0:20:00 - defines it as detected: Trojan program Trojan-Ransom.Win32.Gimemo.dfe </li></ul><br><h4>  Conclusions or whatever </h4><br>  As you can see, all the subjects coped with the task.  But Dr.Web turned out to be the most operational <b>and informative</b> .  After him - who did not participate in the race - the Microsoft Security Essentials to which I submitted the file in the evening, the field of work, and he surprisingly responded for ~ 30min-1 hour.  And he added to the sample in his database about what and notified me in his letter. <br>  3rd place was taken by Kaspersky, although he warned me on the form that if you want efficiency, send it through your personal account.  But still, I think I could condescend to send me a notification in the mail that the virus was added. <br>  4th place avast - no online forms for submission, no report on the delivery of the virus, it is good though the reaction is not more than 24 hours. <br>  What I would like is a simple and efficient service with a maximum of 3 clicks and no quests: <br><ul><li>  Main site </li><li>  Item: Online Scanner </li><li>  Item: Add New </li></ul><br>  PS Addresses for sending new viruses: <br>  Dr.Web: <a href="http://vms.drweb.com/online/">vms.drweb.com/online</a> - immediately after the online check item ‚ÄúAdd new‚Äù <br>  Kaspersky Antivirus: <a href="http://support.kaspersky.ru/virlab/helpdesk.html">support.kaspersky.com/virlab/helpdesk.html</a> <br>  Avast: virus@avast.com - password-protected archive with a password in the text of the letter. <br>  MSSE: <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/security/portal/Submission/Submit.aspx">www.microsoft.com/security/portal/Submission/Submit.aspx</a> <br>  <b>UPD:</b> Address avast scanner scan: <a href="http://onlinescan.avast.com/">onlinescan.avast.com</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/132848/">https://habr.com/ru/post/132848/</a></p>
