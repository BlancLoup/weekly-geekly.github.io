Do I watch Star Wars?</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  <i>Humanity as it was remained trusting.</i>  <i>Only before, Pravda newspaper was unconditionally believed, now Wikipedia, the Google Translate automatic translator and Yandex.Market also believe madly in faith.</i>  <i>Who can you believe?</i>  <i>The next translation on the topic Social &amp; Brand Analytics is devoted to the moments when it is necessary to guard and how to detect a fake review.</i> <br><br>  <b>Has Twitter finally coped with the problem of fake online reviews?</b> <br>  A fake online review has created a whole business in which people offer to write reviews for money.  But under increasing pressure from regulators and new applications that analyze social media in real time, this practice is gradually coming to an end, says Monty Munford. <br><br>  The culture of reviews and critics is certainly strong.  A new episode of "Star Wars" - a lot of people, even from non-fans, were looking forward to it.  Nevertheless, reviews of one or two stars (out of 5) in publications that are not controlled by the film‚Äôs PR teams may discourage people who want to watch it.  The power of the pen, although it is declining, still exists. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Lately, the power of this very pen has been poisoned by the practice of writing fake reviews on sites with so-called ‚Äúreviewers‚Äù ‚Äã‚Äãwho praise restaurants or products in exchange for money.  Some companies have experimented with writing false reviews on sites like TripAdvisor and claim to be 100% successful.

      However, with this fake culture they begin to actively fight.  Amazon recently said it would file lawsuits in the United States against 1,000 people offering false reviews for money. <br><br>  At the same time, the US Senate is considering a bill on the Act on Consumer Freedom of Observation, which is designed to fight cases where buyers, unknowingly, commit themselves to writing online reviews when buying food or other products.  The long-delayed attack on all fronts has finally begun. <br><br>  In the current state of online reviews, there are undoubtedly many drawbacks, and even applications that determine the user's location fall for the bait, simply collecting a large number of saved reviews, thereby inadvertently encouraging the practice of writing purchase reviews. <br><br>  Fortunately, this is an active struggle, and you can thank Twitter users for its beginning.  Last month, the <b>#norecieptnoreview</b> movement reached its peak, demanding that TripAdvisor users could only write a review when they provided a scanned check. <br><br>  And finally, there is a new generation of geo-applications (applications that collect user location data) that extract content from information published in social media and use algorithms to analyze data from Twitter, which means that real reviews are finally possible.  Instead of the usual massive gathering of reviews, they work in real time, collecting information that includes the emotional color of messages, accuracy and location. <br><br>  <b>Twizoo</b> is one such application that restaurants recommend based on similar data, rather than on massively collected reviews.  Twizoo claims that it has access to 700% more data than Yelp or TripAdvisor, which produce only 3 percent of the data from a massive survey collection. <br><br>  ‚ÄúOur app gives recommendations for restaurants based on what Twitter users are writing.  Unlike traditional online review sites, we don‚Äôt rely on massive feedback gathering.  Instead, we developed an algorithm that independently filters relevant views straight from Twitter, "said Madeline Parra, head and founder of Twizoo. <br><br>  ‚ÄúWith entire businesses built around online reviews, such as Yelp and TripAdvisor, maintaining their current business model is becoming more and more expensive,‚Äù she added. <br><br>  The number of businesses and applications using Twitter is rapidly increasing, while the business of false reviews is finally crashing, and companies specializing in monitoring social media are flourishing. <br><br>  One such company in the UK, <b>Brandwatch</b> based in Brighton, has grown from a regional company to a global concern over the past five years.  The company recently received $ 33 million in Series C financing and has 300 employees in 6 major cities. <br><br>  The head of the company, Gilles Palmer, believes that applications such as Twizoo only marked the beginning of a new business and product evaluation system, especially with the rapid development of social media. <br>  ‚ÄúUntil recently, monitoring social media was just a rather passive business, where companies and brands only watched what their users on social media did, but in no way influenced them,‚Äù he said. <br><br>  ‚ÄúBut buyers interested in a product want to make an instant decision based on instantly available data.  They also want this data to be verified and reliable, and Twitter can just provide it. " <br><br>  Any trend that improves the current state of affairs always comes in handy, and although some say that it‚Äôs finally time to attend to the problem of the deplorable state of online reviews, it is certainly pleasing that new algorithms and motivated regulators are involved in the problem. <br><br>  Over time, it will be clear whether the new Star Wars episode will be a masterpiece or not, but real online reviews, published by honest Twitter users, will tell us about this, and not rascals and liars who publish fabricated reviews. <br><br>  <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/news/12046707/Has-Twitter-finally-killed-the-mess-of-the-false-online-review.html">A source</a> <br>  ============= <br><br>  According to Svetlana Krylova, Head of <a href="http://br-analytics.ru/"><b>Brand Analytics</b></a> Analytical Center (the Russian social media monitoring and analysis system is an analogue of the English Brandwatch), the situation in Russia is much tougher: every fifth client is forced to not only monitor feedback about his company and brand, but also actively react (counteract) information attacks of competitors and "bad accounts". <br><br>  The issue of identifying bots and "ordering" is a new large market.  It's time to (counter) act. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/297742/">https://habr.com/ru/post/297742/</a></p>
