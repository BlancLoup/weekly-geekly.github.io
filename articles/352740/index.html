      Let's start with the digital economy in Russia.  The government is going to spend about 50 billion rubles.  to implement research and development in the digital economy.  In particular, it is planned to spend about 1.37 billion rubles to develop strategies for digital transformation of companies.  But the most interesting thing is not even this, but the fact that 650 million rubles will be spent on training 70 Russians in the digital economy abroad. <br><br>  The lucky ones who are members of the Fintech students team will be obliged to return to Russia after completing their course, for which special items will be provided in the regulatory framework. <a name="habracut"></a>  In total <a href="http://gov.cnews.ru/news/top/2018-03-23_obuchenie_70_rossiyan_tsifrovoj_ekonomike_za_granitsej">,</a> about 950 million rubles <a href="http://gov.cnews.ru/news/top/2018-03-23_obuchenie_70_rossiyan_tsifrovoj_ekonomike_za_granitsej">will be allocated</a> from the federal budget for the selection of postgraduate and master programs. <br><br><h3>  With cryptocurrency will remove taxes in the US </h3><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/x_/uu/ba/x_uubawzltglkmxtvf_nnlp3w40.jpeg" width="800"><br><br>  Despite the fact that the legislative base of most countries is not ready to regulate the world of cryptocurrency, the changes are still there, and they are quite noticeable.  In particular, the changes relate to taxation. <br><br>  The relevant US government agency has <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/irs-warns-taxpayers-to-include-crypto-on-income-tax-returns">published a notice</a> , stating the need for US citizens to report their own crypto incomes in income tax declarations. <br><br>  Previously, digital currencies were classified by lawmakers as property, which means that they are subject to federal property taxes.  Well, those who have not reported their cryptocurrency earnings may well receive fines, as well as a compulsory deduction of interest from revenues to the state budget. <br><br>  For especially malicious defaulters, even criminal prosecution is provided.  Office is not just reminded of taxes.  Credit Karma reports that last year only 0.04% of its customers reported on their own cryptocurrency transactions through tax returns. <br><br><h3>  Chatbots will conduct conversations with bank customers </h3><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/gn/3y/fs/gn3yfsp0carrsjfzzla9e3sxyta.jpeg"><br><br>  Many banks use chatbots to speed up customer service.  True, in most cases, these chatbots are not very smart.  They do not answer relatively simple questions, can not recognize many customer requests and generally do not work perfectly. <br><br>  That is why the developers of banking chatbots very closely monitor the success in the world of neural networks.  And the success is very significant. <br><br>  Neural networks and machine intelligence are making great strides.  Some elements of these technologies are already being introduced by banks into their own services.  For example, the ‚Äúvirtual banker‚Äù of the National Bank of Australia can recognize about 13 thousand variations of 200 most frequent customer issues.  Another bank in this country introduced the IBM Watson service in the chatboot functionality to answer questions about loans. <br><br>  Similar systems are used by banks in New Zealand, the United States and some European countries, as well as Russia.  They discuss the possibility of using AI in their services and the bankers of <a href="http://www.fintechnews.org/5214-2/">Israeli banks</a> . <br><br><h3>  Russia is starting to regulate ICO </h3><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/yp/qg/pt/ypqgptnp0qn-nv9edlmuvbmk_f0.jpeg"><br><br>  The state is not too trusting about cryptocurrency and blockchain technologies.  Recently it became known that the Ministry of Communications of the Russian Federation has prepared requirements for the release of digital tokens.  The document, in particular, proposes to oblige the organizers of the primary placement of tokens to use the money from the sale of tokens to enable them to be repurchased from investors at a nominal price.  Moreover, the organization with special accreditation will have to monitor the correctness of the ICO. <br><br>  Issue of digital tokens can be carried out only for Russian rubles by means of cashless settlement.  According to representatives of the cryptocurrency industry, all this goes against the very idea of ‚Äã‚ÄãICO.  What is the point of carrying out the initial placement of their tokens, if the funds have to be kept intact, without using them for the development of a product or service. <br><br>  ‚ÄúAccording to the document, it turns out that money needs to be collected in order to be able to give it away, and not to direct it to internal business processes and investments.  In general, the document contains vague wording, which can cause conflicts, in addition, it is not synchronized with the existing bills, ‚Äùsaid Arseny Shcheltsin, director of the Russian Association of Cryptocurrencies and Blockchain. <br><br>  That's all for today.  See you again! </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/352740/">https://habr.com/ru/post/352740/</a></p>
