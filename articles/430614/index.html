      Smart scales startups Picooc different <s>intelligence and ingenuity</s> ability to calculate the composition of the human body by means of bio-impedancemetry.  The platform of the gadget is equipped with four sensors, which need to stand with bare feet.  Sensors send a weak pulse through your body.  The electrical resistance is determined by the percentage of fat, muscle, water - only 12 indicators.  Including such rare, as an index of visceral fat.  Body weight gadget measures too.  The measurement results are sent to the Russian application Picooc. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/-n/wh/dc/-nwhdcxon74b0b81xbhiszi9g2i.jpeg"><br><br>  Libra is only half the story.  Picooc collects ‚Äúbig data‚Äù for all its users, and then analyzes them in detail.  The user gets convenient graphs with analytics, where you can look at the tendency to increase or decrease its weight, fat mass or muscles.  Immediately a specific recommendation is issued on how to maintain good shape in a healthy way.  For example, the ‚Äúartificial intelligence‚Äù Picooc does not tolerate starvation diets and, at the first suspicion, demands to stop starving.  The application keeps statistics and draws beautiful graphics.  And no, the Chinese social credit system is not integrated there, but the data are exported to Google Fit and Apple Health. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/_y/s5/oj/_ys5ojioo0m2dhvh7ij3snlbk7y.jpeg"><br><br>  Different models of Picooc scales have the same basic functions.  The only difference is in size and volume, whether Wi-Fi and Bluetooth are supported.  By Bluetooth, the measurement results are transmitted to the mobile application on the smartphone.  If the scales are with Wi-Fi, then they automatically upload data to the Picooc cloud.  In this case, launch the application each time (to save all measurements on the smartphone) is not required. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/vd/n7/fs/vdn7fsyw-gp1x0ocnnyjz2-1rea.png"><br><br><h3>  <a href="https://madrobots.ru/p/razor-turbo-jetts/%3Futm_source%3Dhabr.com%26utm_medium%3Dpr%26utm_campaign%3Dblackfriday1801">Razor TurboJetts electric rolls - 50% discount</a> </h3><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/vi/id/nz/viidnze8rgu_2lxq06yame4xacy.jpeg"><br><br>  Razor TurboJetts rolls turn any pair of shoes into a wearable mobile vehicle.  A silent electric motor with a power of 80 watts, built into one of the rollers, gives the rider a speed of up to 16 km / h.  The charge of a removable lithium-ion battery lasts for 30 minutes. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/DlpEoD6Fqak" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br>  TurboJetts are worn over sneakers or boots and cover only the heel.  That is, you need to ride "on heels", and before a bump or other obstacle it is easy to slow down and go to the step.  50mm polyurethane wheels and high-quality bearings ensure a smooth and smooth running.  Electric rolls are suitable for children and adults, the size of the shoe should not exceed 46.

Aurora connects via Wi-Fi to a smartphone.  The smartphone should have the Nanoleaf application, with its help you can adjust the colors, brightness and animation of the panels.  If you want to portray aurora borealis on your wall, or to set color music a la "mad rave" - ‚Äã‚Äãthen the application already has relevant topics.  You can also customize your own themes: 16.7 million colors are at your service. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/ds/dl/lo/dsdllob2f2_lqbahctkkwvbqbxq.jpeg"><br><br>  By the way, the panels are able to listen to music and play to the beat.  For this, they will need a small <a href="https://madrobots.ru/p/nanoleaf-aurora-rhythm/%3Futm_source%3Dhabr.com%26utm_medium%3Dpr%26utm_campaign%3Dblackfriday1801">Nanoleaf Rhytm</a> module, which is sold separately.  Even for Aurora there are <a href="https://madrobots.ru/p/dopolnitelnye-paneli-3-nanoleaf-aurora-smarter-kit/%3Futm_source%3Dhabr.com%26utm_medium%3Dpr%26utm_campaign%3Dblackfriday1801">additional sets of panels</a> .  Only one controller supports up to 30 panels at a time. <br><br><h3>  <a href="https://madrobots.ru/brands/pacsafe/%3Futm_source%3Dhabr.com%26utm_medium%3Dpr%26utm_campaign%3Dblackfriday1801">Pacsafe backpacks and bags - up to 50% off</a> </h3><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/n8/ke/n2/n8ken2sigrcdpxlxbdmggpdcv4s.jpeg"><br><br>  Pacsafe was founded in the early 90s by two travelers, obsessed with the desire to make really safe travel bags and backpacks.  Such not to cut, not open imperceptibly, not to pull out from under the nose of a scattered tourist, while he orders a cup of coffee in an outdoor cafe. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/qZhMuAmfwU0" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br>  Over the decades of work, the Pacsafe team has developed various ways to protect baggage.  They come down to four categories.  The first is anti-opening: the fabric is reinforced with a stiff steel mesh, and the straps are reinforced with thin steel slings.  The second is the zippers.  These locks and carbines hold the "dogs" in place.  So the thief will not be able to unbutton his pocket or branch.  Third: locks for lines.  Snap off such a lock, wrap a sling around a table leg or fence, snap it.  Now the bag will not be stolen unnoticed by you.  The fourth category, pockets with protection against RFID attacks, has appeared recently.  It is clear that the specialist will roll his eyes when he heard about the rarely skimming, but Pacsafe decided to take care of it. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/ad/mq/tu/admqtu-13xngnyqykmsa8_5jkwq.jpeg"><br><br>  All these types of protection are embodied in things designed to travel and ordinary life at home.  Pacsafe products include city backpacks, and not quite urban ones, belt bags, purses, laptop bags, and slings.  Different sizes, with consistently stylish design.  Protective measures are invisible, so they will not look at you in surprise, as if you have fastened a chest with a granary lock.  Soon we will tell about some models of Pacsafe in more detail. <br><br><h3>  <a href="https://madrobots.ru/p/wacaco-nanopresso/%3Futm_source%3Dhabr.com%26utm_medium%3Dpr%26utm_campaign%3Dblackfriday1801">Wacaco Nanopresso portable coffee machine - 20% discount</a> </h3><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/ln/0z/2a/ln0z2atdeg03fsbka4e9a7t6ypw.jpeg"><br><br>  Wacaco Nanopresso is a manual espresso machine.  The device is mechanical and does not require electricity.  To make a cup of espresso, you need only boiling water and ground coffee beans. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/AQxiXCtn9lY" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br>  The compact espresso machine looks like a capsule and is comparable in size to a small thermos.  Inside the capsule is a pump, which is driven by a tight button-piston.  The pump creates pressure up to 18 bar. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/oa/9n/-l/oa9n-l5bazda7olxlcijhsy_fr0.jpeg"><br><br>  Preparing espresso this way: you take Nanopresso apart, find a filter cup, pour coffee into it.  Then in the water compartment you need to pour hot water.  Connect the parts of the machine, turn the neck down over the cup, and begin to pressurize the piston.  It will take about 10-15 clicks per serving, depending on the degree of grinding.  At the exit coffee with a dense skin turns out. <br><br><h3>  <a href="https://madrobots.ru/p/rombica-neo-ns120-quick/%3Futm_source%3Dhabr.com%26utm_medium%3Dpr%26utm_campaign%3Dblackfriday1801">External battery Rombica NEO NS120 Quick - 30% discount</a> </h3><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/wk/fr/s3/wkfrs3mk_t-jsnuv4gm3v2krheo.jpeg"><br><br>  Rombica NEO NS 120 Quick poverbank is designed for charging smartphones, tablets, headphones, Bluetooth speakers, action cameras and other small devices.
