Pocket gadgets are now not just computers reduced to the size of a palm, but tools that allow the user to control entire areas of his life with one finger ‚Äî all areas into which the Internet has penetrated: communication, entertainment, travel, information search ... <br>  The list can be continued indefinitely.  In many ways, the navigation of the Internet into our lives has been facilitated by GPS navigation.  Now, when almost everyone has a GPS receiver in his pocket, many services have had the opportunity to improve our lives.  However, we first consider the history of the origin of GPS. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h4>  1. The history of the emergence and development of navigation technology </h4><br>  GPS (from the English. Global Positioning System) is a satellite navigation system that provides distance, time measurement and determines the location of objects (see Figure 1). <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/d30/d04/453/d30d044532c1424a52a0d412af350139.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  The project was implemented and belongs to the US military.  The main objective of the project is to determine the current coordinates of the user on the surface of the Earth or in near-Earth space [4].

      The idea of ‚Äã‚Äãcreating satellite navigation was born in the 50s.  At the moment when the USSR launched the first artificial satellite of the Earth, American scientists, led by Richard Kershner, observed a signal coming from a Soviet satellite and found that due to the Doppler effect, the frequency of the received signal increases as the satellite approaches. distance away  The essence of the discovery was that if you know your coordinates on Earth accurately, then it becomes possible to measure the position and speed of the satellite, and vice versa, knowing the satellite‚Äôs position accurately, you can determine your own speed and coordinates (see Figure 2). <br><br><img src="http://palmgps.ru/upload/image/gps-4.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  This idea was implemented in 20 years.  The first test satellite was put into orbit on July 14, 1974 in the USA, and the last of all 24 satellites needed to fully cover the earth‚Äôs surface was put into orbit in 1993, thus the global positioning system was put into service.  It has become possible to use GPS for accurate guidance of rockets at fixed and then at mobile objects in the air and on Earth. <br><br>  Initially, the global positioning system was developed as a purely military project.  But after a Korean airline with 269 passengers aboard, which invaded Soviet airspace in 1983, was shot down, US President Ronald Reagan allowed partial use of the navigation system for civilian purposes.  But the accuracy was reduced by a special algorithm. <br>  Then information appeared that some companies deciphered the algorithm for reducing the accuracy at the L1 frequency and successfully compensated for this component of the error, and in 2000 this degradation of accuracy was canceled by a decree of the US President [2]. <br><br>  The table below shows the chronology of GPS development (see Table 1). <br><br><h6>  Table 1- GPS Development Timeline </h6><br>  Date Event <br>  1973 Decision on the development of a satellite navigation system <br>  1974-1979 testing system <br>  1977 Reception of a signal from a ground station simulating a satellite system <br>  1978-1985 Launch of eleven satellites of the first group (Block I) <br>  1979 Reduced program funding.

As a result, the Delta launch vehicle was chosen as the main vehicle. <br>  1988 Decision to deploy an orbital constellation of 24 satellites.  18 satellites are not able to ensure the smooth operation of the system <br>  1989 Activation of satellites of the second group <br>  1990‚Äì1991 Temporary SA shutdown (eng.

GPS today </h4><br><h5>  2.1.  GPS games </h5><br>  The revolution of geo-targeting services, that is, built around locating something (user or point on the map), could have been predicted before the advent of new-fangled smartphones.  People began to go crazy about GPS navigation as soon as it became widespread.  On May 1, 2000, the White House press service announced that the deliberate deterioration in the accuracy of civilian GPS receivers had been stopped, and already on May 3, one of the GPS fans Dave Ulmer decided to check the accuracy of navigation.  He called this idea ‚Äúa big American cache hunt using GPS‚Äù and reported it to other users via the Internet.  The idea was very simple: somewhere in the forest a container is hidden, and its geographical coordinates are recorded.  Other players must find the ‚Äútreasure‚Äù using their GPS receivers.  The rule for the finder: take some things, leave something of your own.  Ulmer placed his own container (black bucket) near Portland.  Together with the magazine, where participants could mark their visit, and with a pencil he left small gifts: videotapes, books, CDs and a slingshot.  Within three days the cache was found by two players who read about it on the net.  Other enthusiasts began to place their own caches and publish their coordinates, supporting the initiative.  Like many other ideas on the Internet, the new game very quickly gained popularity and eventually got a new name - geocaching.  The site Geocaching.com remains to this day a popular resource for geocashers from all over the world, and in Russia there is a geocaching.su resource.  The Russian version is slightly different from the western one: it is recommended to create caches in the domestic version of the game in places that have historical, cultural or natural significance [1]. <br><br><h5>  2.2.  GPS tags </h5><br>  On the basis of geocaching, GPS tag ideas were implemented.  Foursquare service offers users to mark on the map interesting places, bars, cafes, theaters, in other matters, anything that may interest others.  Thanks to this service, it is much easier to find a bar where your friend recently noted, rather than resort to an Internet search.  However, foursquare has no less successful counterparts, both Russians - AlterGeo, and foreign - Gowalla.  Similar services are also developing inside social networks: on Facebook - Places, on VKontakte - places that allow you to check in any place and mark friends who are next to you.  It can be assumed that "Places" will pervade almost the whole world. <br><br><h5>  2.3.  The virtual reality </h5><br>  Already began to appear the first GPS navigators, conducting the route lines directly in the image from the built-in video camera.  True, they work worse than ever, it is difficult to combine an inaccurate GPS tag on a map with a video image.  However, the creators of Layar, an augmented reality browser, managed to do this.  It is capable of combining information maps with the readings of a GSP receiver and a compass, superimposing the result on the image from the video camera (see Figure 3). <br><br><img src="http://site.jusbox.be/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/layar_dreamcatcher_keynote09_template003.png" alt="image"><br><br>  However, this is just a browser, not a navigator, that is, you can only know about the point, the distance that separates you, but you won‚Äôt know how to get to it and what is between you. <br>  An interesting application released site "Around the World."  It is able to determine the location and automatically begins a story about the nearest sight.  Pleases also the fact that there is a manual mode and, in case of a GPS error, you can select the object of interest manually. <br><br><h5>  2.4.  GPS maps </h5><br>  Of course, it is impossible not to mention the main consumers of this technology - mobile cards.  Google Maps, pre-installed in every decent smartphone, and ‚ÄúYandex.  Maps, which have a more accurate map of Russia today, fight for our market, continually adding new functions and services, becoming better and more complex.  Three-dimensional view and fast vector map from Google against more competent navigation and more accurate raster map from Yandex.  Unconditional leadership in displaying road congestion and car routing, as well as nearly becoming ‚Äúgeo-targeting twitter‚Äù user comments on Yandex‚Äôs map versus Google‚Äôs recently launched full-featured navigation mode.  More competent search in Russian-speaking names at Yandex against pedestrian routing taking into account public transport at Google.  You can choose endlessly, but in the end, each user has both cards.  It is necessary for ‚ÄúYandex‚Äù to release a car navigator inside maps, similar to Google, and this will forever change the GPS navigation market, giving us a choice of two free, quickly updated and compact navigators.  And this will make the usual GPS navigators archaism [1]. <br><br><h4>  3. Who needs it? </h4><br>  What will help an ordinary person in the life of a GPS device (see Figure 4)? <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/1a0/57e/873/1a057e8738e27f46d3a441fb5f856b14.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  The best city navigation program will pave the way for you to a given address.  And if you ask for a good one, then there are several routes to choose from.  Moreover, if you chose one, but on the way decided to deviate from the recommendations, right there, on the go, the route will be recalculated.  She also predicts the expected speed and arrival time to the destination, guides you to the place, warning you in advance on the screen (and if you turn on the voice mode, then with your voice) about turns, turns and other shifts of simple direct movement.  And also, if you have to face any difficult interchange, it will automatically increase its image to full clarity and indicate which of the sleeves you need to move.  Moreover, some programs (and low-cost subscription services attached to them) make it possible to take into account in the calculations data on real traffic jams and suggest routes that are longer, maybe long, but at the moment faster.  True, these services are still just beginning to develop, and the infrastructure designed to provide them is not yet fully established. <br><br>  If we are talking about driving and driving in a foreign city, and that Pushcha is abroad, here without a navigator (connected to a smart program and equipped with the most recent maps, which are usually updated frequently via the Internet), you simply cannot do [3]. <br><br><h4>  Conclusion </h4><br>  One can only guess what development navigation will receive in the future.  Perhaps all movement, including personal transport, will be controlled by automatic computer systems, and navigation will control movements, preventing you from going astray and preventing collisions with other objects.  Perhaps, GPS will be replaced by a more advanced technology, which allows receiving a signal at a depth of several kilometers and not losing accuracy from external factors.  However, it is clear that development is just beginning. <br><br><h4>  Bibliography </h4><br>  1. Banin, D. Everything is at stake / D. Banin, R.
