Meanwhile, it is quite an interesting market with a large number of players who develop and sell a variety of products. <br><br>  In today's material to your attention 24 tools for the automation of the restaurant business.  In preparing the review, I also tried to assess the quality of the work of the company's support services and the speed of response to the requests of potential customers, information about this is also presented in the article. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  <i>System names are clickable</i>

    <h4>  R-keeper </h4><br>  The oldest player in the automation of the restaurant business.  The first version of the R-Keeper program was created in 1992, at the moment the system is installed in 37 thousand restaurants in different countries of the world. <br><br>  The system includes various modules (front office for direct work in a restaurant and back office for controlling processes and costs) and applications.  Despite the popularity, some users complain about a rather complex and non-intuitive interface. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/530/ef2/abd/530ef2abda484bb0a54e6fb35771af0c.png"><br><br>  As for the support service, the possibility of support via chat (which would be convenient) is not provided, no one answered a few phone calls. <br><br>  <b>Installation type</b> : system is installed locally <br><br>  <b>The cost of the license</b> : from 77,000 to 180,000 rubles. <br><br><h4>  iiko </h4><br>  The project, created by co-founder of ABBYY, David Yan, ranks second in popularity in Russia.  The system is characterized by the presence of a large number of different modules that are connected to a special server and work through it.  There is the functionality of the front and back office. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/f89/5eb/094/f895eb094da94bfb9cbf7c14b8d2ff83.jpg"><br><br>  A large number of modules that are connected for a fee, is quite difficult to administer, which leads to an increased likelihood of failures. <br><br>  There is no support with the help of chat, telephone communication in 24/7 mode is quite operational, but connected to operators who are not aware of all the technical details of the system. <br><br>  <b>Installation Type</b> : Local <br><br>  <b>Cost</b> : the basic functionality of the program costs 23990 rubles for the server, 19990 for iikoFront (automation of the cash station) and 11990 for iikoOffice (automation of the warehouse management) <br><br><h4>  Jowi </h4><br>  Hybrid automation service that combines cloud and local approaches - the Jowi module is installed in a restaurant, and then the data is synchronized to remote servers.  This allows you to keep the system working even when the Internet is ‚Äúfalling‚Äù. <br><br>  The system is also modular - there are applications for managers of the hall, waiters who synchronize data with each other (the waiter accepted the order, the cook saw which dish to cook, the manager receives information about the cooking time, etc.) <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/b9a/05b/255/b9a05b255842472e8c35a26a69acc0a4.jpg"><br><br>  According to <a href="http://siliconrus.com/2015/05/jowi/">statistics of the founder of the service, the</a> program is used by 3,500 institutions in the CIS countries.  A fairly flexible system, for example, it allows you to change various data even in hindsight - in the ‚Äúreal world‚Äù such a need should arise quite often. <br><br>  It is possible to communicate in various ways - I tried to contact several times, I got an answer pretty quickly. <br><br>  <b>Installation Type</b> : Local + SaaS <br><br>  <b>Cost</b> : $ 150 per month <br><br><h4>  Poster </h4><br>  An automation system with cloud storage that runs on iPad and Android tablets.  The workplace of the cashier or waiter is working on the tablet, checks are printed on the thermal printer Epson TM-T20. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/cdc/f0f/95c/cdcf0f95ccc54aedb4dba36ff27ace98.png"><br><br>  The site has an excellent FAQ on working with the product, there is support in the chat, but when I tried to use it, there was not a single online consultant.  Perhaps some kind of glitch. <br><br>  <b>Installation Type</b> : Local + SaaS <br><br>  <b>Cost</b> : $ 24- $ 79 per month <br><br><h4>  Quick resto </h4><br>  Cloud automation system of the restaurant business, which allows you to manage the menu, seating guests, accept payments and set up printers for printing checks.  The history of the project <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/quickresto/blog/257389/">is described</a> in his blog on Habr√©. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/5bf/6ea/3eb/5bf6ea3ebe89477ead11d6721b914817.png"><br><br>  Of the small flaws (although this is rather hypothetical) - there is no support for Windows, only iOS and Android.  To connect peripheral devices you need to purchase <a href="http://quickresto.ru/shop/%3FSECTION_ID%3D21%26ELEMENT_ID%3D326">QR Box</a> .  In the app menu, the dishes come with pictures - it is beautiful, but in the course of work it can distract the waiters. <br><br>  Support works 24/7, responds efficiently and quickly. <br><br>  <b>Installation Type</b> : Saas + Mobile <br><br>  <b>Cost</b> : from 2990 rubles.  / month (1 terminal) <br><br><h4>  ASTOR </h4><br>  Company engaged in the automation of retail, logistics and food industry in Russia and the CIS.  According to the site, 12,000 customers use the restaurant solution. <br><br>  It is positioned as a system for small and medium-sized restaurants, there are back-up and front-office modules, there are applications for cashiers, hall managers, managers, storekeepers, waiters, and so on. <br><br>  There is no instant messaging service, and by phone there are no answers about the work of the system, offering to get acquainted with the presentation. <br><br>  <b>Installation Type</b> : Local <br><br>  <b>Cost</b> : from $ 3100 <br><br><h4>  GBS.Market </h4><br>  The system for automating shops and cafes is a fairly simple program for small establishments with a corresponding modest set of functions.  Reporting from the terminal can be sent by mail. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/9db/8a9/e8c/9db8a9e8c8444a13a489a910a15fb39d.png"><br><br>  Contact someone on the site contacts failed. <br><br>  <b>Installation Type</b> : Local + SaaS <br><br>  <b>Cost</b> : 119 rubles per month for 1 pc, 3475 rubles.  unlimited tariff <br><br><h4>  Microinvest </h4><br>  Bulgarian company operating in the CIS.  For mobile applications and additional features, payment is taken separately, there is a module for cooks (on Android).  It is rather difficult to set up, and the interface (as, in general, the site itself) is not beautiful and convenient - the menu is not very convenient, with an emphasis on pictures of dishes, when ordering an account, the cost of all dishes is not displayed. <br><br>  Skype and phone support - they don't answer every time, but they are quite tolerant.  There are no representative offices in Russia, so a specialist‚Äôs departure is impossible. <br><br>  <b>Installation Type</b> : SaaS + Mobile <br><br>  <b>Cost</b> : 8 499 rubles <br><br><h4>  iSOK POS STORE </h4><br>  POS-system, originally created for shops, but can be used in a small restaurant or cafe. <br><br>  It can work both in single-player mode (1 device - only iPad), and in dual mode, when one mobile device is the main one and the second is the client one.  Synchronization via the Internet, that is, there is no SaaS model. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/35a/0f0/289/35a0f02898c94c5ea1b0cfa90033ca3f.jpg"><br><br>  The application itself is free, but you will have to pay for some of the necessary functions, such as printer settings and a cash register.  Not the most flexible system - for example, there is no possibility of backdating data.  The data storage period on trading devices ranges from 2 to 40 days. <br><br>  We could not find any communication options with the developers, but the site has a good FAQ. <br><br>  <b>Installation Type</b> : Mobile <br><br>  <b>Cost</b> : Free with payment for additional functions <br><br><h4>  <a href="http://traktir.ru/">Traktir</a> </h4><br>  Service, sharpened by work with mobile devices on iOS and Android.  There is an application for waiters and an electronic menu with which you can place orders without waiters.  It is frustrating that each module costs some money.  According to various estimates, the system uses from 2000 to 3000 institutions. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/fa6/b13/648/fa6b13648f68423680953c9c09d452e5.png"><br><br>  You cannot communicate with chat support, the client manager on the phone, who does not know the technical details of the implementation and installation, answers. <br><br>  <b>Installation Type</b> : Local + Saas + Mobile <br><br>  <b>Cost</b> : front office for 13,000 rubles, back office for 11,500 rubles, etc. <br><br><h4>  <a href="http://www.econcept.ru/">Intellect Style</a> </h4><br>  A simple, locally installed program for the automation of hotels and small establishments.  The interface module of the waiter is clearly overloaded - for example, there are a lot of functions that can be activated when working with an account that can distract the waiter. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/4c7/06c/35e/4c706c35e9794ece9f6f3f20b04654a6.jpg"><br><br>  Of the benefits - there is a chat support, the disadvantage of which is that the operator could answer and more. <br><br>  <b>Installation Type</b> : Local <br><br>  <b>Cost</b> : from 14,900 rubles. <br><br><h4>  <a href="http://guscom.by/rus/">Guscom.POS</a> </h4><br>  A cross-platform automation complex that includes several modules ‚Äî among them, a module for connecting fiscal printers, an application for waiters, and an administration service. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/07d/bdc/92c/07dbdc92c9b74e509b7afca737fef4bd.png"><br><br>  There is an instant messaging service in which no one answered me (however, as well as by phone.) <br><br>  <b>Installation Type</b> : Local <br><br>  <b>Cost</b> : on request <br><br><h4>  <a href="http://rest.magicsoft.ru/">"Magic"</a> </h4><br>  Automation system of cash accounting and management in places of public catering and entertainment centers.  The local module works with the Microsoft SQL Server database, integration with 1C Accounting is possible.  There are some pretty advanced features like video recording of the moment of order editing. <br><br>  More suitable for restaurants, combined with billiards, bowling and other entertainment.  According to the site, the system is used by more than 500 clients. <br><br>  Basic support by email only to find out the phone - you need to be registered and verified by the user. <br><br>  <b>Installation Type</b> : Local <br><br>  <b>Cost</b> : standard set with equipment for 71900 rub. <br><br><h4>  <a href="http://pos-sector.net/">Pos Sector</a> </h4><br>  They immediately write on the site that there are already more than 4.5 million users of the system.  A local module with a simple and intuitive interface - it creates dishes, departments, warehouses and similar entities.  There is also a browser application for waiters. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/249/6a1/92e/2496a192ee3344feb8be89c3dd4d604c.jpg"><br><br>  The operator answered all the questions in detail, so with support everything is fine. <br><br>  <b>Installation Type</b> : Local <br><br>  <b>Cost</b> : basic license $ 590 (per 1 computer) <br><br><h4>  <a href="http://www.z-cash.ru/index.php%3Foption%3Dcom_content%26task%3Dview%26id%3D1%26Itemid%3D3">Z-Cash Restaurant Suite</a> </h4><br>  Free system for the automation of the restaurant business with open source - plus such solutions in saving, the disadvantages are also clear (one of them is the complete lack of support). <br><br>  <b>Installation Type</b> : Local <br><br>  <b>Cost</b> : Free <br><br><h4>  <a href="http://restorator-msk.ru/">RST: Restaurant</a> </h4><br>  This system is <a href="http://mir-restoratora.ru/%3Fp%3D12982">used by</a> more than 2000 institutions.  There are front and back office (plus the integration module with 1C), an application for the waiter.  One month free service is provided. <br><br>  Technical support by mail only. <br><br>  <b>Installation Type</b> : Local <br><br>  <b>Cost</b> : from 10,000 to 50,000 rubles. <br><br><h4>  Gedymin and POSitive </h4><br>  The local accounting module ‚Äú <a href="http://www.kkc.by/shop/product/84-gedymin.html">Gedymin</a> ‚Äù is a universal back office to which various programs for the front office can be connected.  SQL database, open source. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/459/46b/f15/45946bf154e64206a7e118c64ffe96f6.jpg"><br><br>  For several days, no one was able to make contact. <br><br>  <b>Cost</b> : a <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/174_UE63_jlQ0iiYDpxDdRqugM8IiX4htgSSZQi3Pf6w/pub">large number in Belarusian rubles</a> <br><br>  As a front office, you can use the local development of the same company called <a href="http://www.kkc.by/shop/product/positive:_check_%2528front_office%2529.html">POSitive</a> . <br><br>  <b>Cost</b> : <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/174_UE63_jlQ0iiYDpxDdRqugM8IiX4htgSSZQi3Pf6w/pub">prices in Belarusian rubles</a> <br><br><h4>  <a href="http://averstech.ru/restaurant.html">System "Expert"</a> </h4><br>  The complex turnkey solution includes a trading room module, manager part, report service, calculation and warehouse modules.  It was not possible to wait for the operator‚Äôs response immediately, but they respond in detail and to the point. <br><br>  <b>Installation Type</b> : Local <br><br>  <b>Cost</b> : 219,000 rubles <br><br><h4>  <a href="http://bit-appetit.ru/">Bit.Appetit</a> </h4><br>  The company provides institutions with a range of services for the selection of software for automation (including its own production), its implementation (with equipment) and support.  The number of clients is more than 2500 establishments in Russia and the CIS (including well-known networks like Yakitori and Coffee House). <br><br>  Own development on the basis of 1C on the business processes laid down quite significantly behind the competing and more modern solutions.  Technical support by phone, more difficult questions on costing - by mail only. <br><br>  <b>Installation Type</b> : Local <br><br>  <b>Cost</b> : comprehensive automation of the restaurant from 250000 <br><br><h4>  <a href="http://simple-soft.ru/Stolovaya.htm">Simple dining room</a> </h4><br>  A program that can be customized for a specific type of institution.  Allows you to control the receipt of products, keep records of dishes, track balances in stock and so on. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/b6d/426/32d/b6d42632d8d9498ea3a15635b3cd4f20.gif"><br><br>  Contrary to the name of the installation and work with it are not so easy.  Best of all, the degree of ‚Äúsimplicity‚Äù of interaction is illustrated by the scheme of support work: for the user's problem to be addressed, he needs to remove the video of the problem, take a screenshot and make a backup of the database. <br><br>  <b>Installation Type</b> : Local <br><br>  <b>Cost</b> : 3000 rubles. <br><br><h4>  <a href="http://www.2-byte.ru/programms/">BitRest</a> </h4><br>  The program allows logging of all actions of the personnel of the institution, access to the reports can be obtained via the Internet, the developer company also trains the staff.  Support is only by telephone and is not particularly operational. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/fe0/3c9/5ea/fe03c95ea4d34d84bb917c04c00451c8.png"><br><br>  <b>Installation Type</b> : Local <br><br>  <b>Cost</b> : 45,000 rubles <br><br><h4>  <a href="http://www.forrestpos.ru/">For rest</a> </h4><br>  Convenient program that allows you to create orders, accept payments, make a seating of the hall, provide discounts to customers and view reports. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/2d4/08c/12c/2d408c12cbe0407cb551323668348b1f.jpg"><br><br>  There are some disadvantages of the interface (for example, the price for a dish is not displayed in the invoice), but non-critical. <br><br>  Phone support only, many regional offices.  The speed at altitude. <br><br>  <b>Installation Type</b> : Local <br><br>  <b>Cost</b> : 21,000 rubles. <br><br><h4>  <a href="http://www.helpmix.com/">Helpmix</a> </h4><br>  The system allows waiters to work through a stationary or mobile touchscreen tablet or a regular computer.  Accounting of balances in warehouses is made, products are written off in real time, accounting of working hours, fixing of time and fines are kept.  Manual can view reports remotely.  Work does not require the presence of the Internet. <br><br>  Judging by the data on the site, at the moment more than 50 institutions are customers of the Ukrainian project. <br><br>  <b>Installation Type</b> : Local <br><br>  <b>Cost</b> : basic kit ~ $ 530 <br><br><h4>  Conclusion </h4><br>  In this review, we looked at a significant number of various tools and services, but they, of course, are much more numerous, and many projects did not make it into the article.  Share in the comments links to interesting automation tools, and maybe in the future there will be material for another article. <br><br>  Thanks for attention! </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/258679/">https://habr.com/ru/post/258679/</a></p>
