He concludes that, at the moment, on the smartwatch, first of all, actions are needed, not applications - they are too heavy. <br><br>  In the article that appeared a little earlier, Luke says that <a href="http://www.lukew.com/ff/entry.asp%3F1947">removing the visible part of the interface often simply transfers it to the user's memory</a> - he needs to know all the gestures, hotkeys and other actions that are not clearly shown in the interface.  He cites the example of Android Wear and Apple Watch, where you have to remember a lot to work with the interface. <br><br>  <strong><a href="http://uxmovement.com/wireframes/why-the-best-wireframe-style-is-no-style/">Why the Best Wireframe Style Is No Style</a></strong> <br>  Anthony T recalls that wireframes should be black and white, without using spectacular styling, as you can see more and more on the same Dribbble.  Their task is to convey the structure and logic of the screens, in order to proceed as soon as possible to the design, and not to be a separate selling tool.  <a href="http://siliconrus.com/2015/05/wireframe-no-style/">Translation into Russian</a> . <br><br>  <strong><a href="https://medium.com/%40wenting_zhang/getting-fluent-at-the-language-of-iconography-3415d03d0a8f">Getting fluent at the language of iconography</a></strong> <br>  Wenting Zhang writes that some icons denote nouns, and some - verbs, and it is important not to combine them.

They are trying to solve a real problem - often the results of testing are stored in disparate documents in different places, and the information inside them is in no way semantically linked.  Here, everything is in one place, tagged and linked.
