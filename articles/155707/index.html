  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Domestic author blogs for geeks</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  It happens that Habr is read, world news has been studied, a new book has not been started, and I want some high-quality technical information ‚Äî notes from programmers, links to interesting news from western colleagues, and simply geek pieces.  How to be in this case?  You can refer to the Western technical blogosphere, fortunately, there is plenty to choose from.  But the domestic blogosphere with programmer and geek bias can please the most captious reader.  Under the cat collected links to the most interesting (according to the author) blogs of Russian IT-figures.  On Habr√© <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/59231/">there was already</a> something similar, but without a description and a clear subject.  The blogs listed here will be more interesting to programmers. <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  1. <a href="http://softwaremaniacs.org/">http://softwaremaniacs.org/</a> <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/631/ccb/2b0/631ccb2b0f90b9cc38a454c9b671d2fe.png" alt="image"><br>  Blog Ivan Sagalaeva - programmer, architect and evangelist.  In the past, Ivan was the head of the content services development group at Yandex.  In his blog, he talks about parallel and asynchronous calculations, high loads, and also parses the guts of Django.  Many notes are supported by examples that the Yandex team actually encountered when developing various services. <br><br>  Ivan is the author of many well-known libraries (perhaps the most famous are <a href="https://github.com/isagalaev/ijson">IJSON</a> and <a href="">highlight.js</a> ).  There are also notes about their development in the blog.

      Among other things, the site has a forum where experienced and not very Django programmers hang out, discussing various issues related to this framework. <br><br>  2. <a href="http://addmeto.cc/">addmeto.cc</a> <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/1ea/2dd/670/1ea2dd6703b1ff87962d9b1d6a2339a9.png" alt="image"><br>  Linkblog Gregory Bakunov - previously deputy.  the head of the Yandex development department, and now the director of technology distribution at Yandex.  Grigory is known to many Habr's readers as one of the leading IT podcast <a href="http://radio-t.com/">radio-t</a> ;  he is also <a href="https://twitter.com/bobuk/">known on twitter</a> . <br><br>  In his linkblog, he conducts an experiment - reads the news exactly an hour a day and shares the most interesting of them with the readers of his linkblog (although he doesn‚Äôt always do that, because he is busy).  The blog contains links to a variety of topics - from interesting videos on youtube, to rare libraries and descriptions of various technologies.  Bobuk accompanies each link with a brief description, from which, by the way, his attitude towards various modern technologies emerges (probably, for his interesting and authoritative opinion, he became such a popular blogger). <br><br>  By the way, anyone <a href="">can participate</a> in filling the blog with links. <br><br>  3. <a href="http://dmitrysoshnikov.com/ecmascript/ru-javascript-the-core/">Dmitry Soshnikov blog</a> <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/d82/f3e/a19/d82f3ea1985ebd75a88b893febdf2128.png" alt="image"><br>  Dmitry Soshnikov is a recognized domestic authority in the field of ECMAscript.  In his blog, he tells various subtleties of the language, gives examples of the implementation of the Javascript core in Javascript (this is really very cool), tells about these or other hidden features.  I believe that everyone who programs in JS a little bit should become familiar with his works. <br><br>  By the way, the link above does not lead to the main page of his blog (where there are mostly links to translations), but to the description of the Javascript core with cross-references to notes on other subtleties of the language. <br><br>  4. <a href="http://vorushin.ru/">Roman Vorushin's blog</a> <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/dfb/25d/c54/dfb25dc54d8957a9aed8572127d525ad.png" alt="image"><br>  Roman works as a developer in Google Z√ºrich and has long been an interesting blog about his life, web development, Python and Django.  Many programmers who were looking for answers to certain questions often came across notes on the blog of Roman. <br><br>  5. <a href="http://alenacpp.blogspot.com/">Alena C ++</a> <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/544/85c/26d/54485c26d3d69c269a8a66c0de90d0b8.png" alt="image"><br>  Alena Sagalaeva, better known on the Internet as Alena C ++, by the way, is the wife of Ivan Sagalayev mentioned here.  Alena works in Bing and keeps a blog about various geeky things, of course with a bias in C ++.  Her blog also often contains links to other interesting posts. <br><br>  6. <a href="http://spb-borodin.livejournal.com/">Dmitry Borodin's blog</a> <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/dfa/941/71f/dfa94171f62edc441d862af5ba755b6c.png" alt="image"><br>  The whole blog is represented by two posts, which are of the greatest value - in them, Dmitry talks about the device highload applications.  Dmitry himself is a leading developer (or just a director, here I can be mistaken) in a company that has developed the most popular VKontakte applications - <a href="http://topface.com/auth/">Topface</a> , <a href="http://vkurse.ru/">VKourse</a> and others.  These applications withstand enormous loads with relatively modest resources.  A few years ago, Dmitry quite abruptly broke off me at an interview, which caused interest in his person and the architecture of highload applications advertised by him. <br><br>  We can say that in his LJ special value is presented not so much by the records, as his responses to comments.  According to his answers, you can approximately reproduce the architecture used in his team, which really allows you to scale any project indefinitely horizontally (tested on your own experience). <br><br>  By the way, the architecture itself is not a big secret - Dmitry willingly talks about it at master classes, which, however, do not take place very often. <br><br>  7. <a href="http://slonik-v-domene.livejournal.com/">slonik-v-domene</a> <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/7cb/e96/077/7cbe960776491cd5d26afc5e0c55a114.png" alt="image"><br>  Andrey Shetuhin's blog - the head of the development department of Rambler.  About C, C ++, * NIX, such a cool thing as <a href="http://slonik-v-domene.livejournal.com/59310.html">CTPP</a> and mail.  Briefly, rudely and with a humor - what we need. <br><br><h5>  Instead of conclusion </h5><br><br>  In this note, I reviewed 7 blogs - those that were useful to me earlier or are useful and informative now.  I would be grateful to habrabatchitelyam for links to other curious author blogs. <br><br>  Pay attention to the design of blogs - it is almost absent.  There is only text and headings - nothing more.  Perhaps this is the recipe for an ideal (read successful) blog. <br><br>  PS Screenshots are made using the <a href="http://cropme.ru/">cropme.ru</a> service. <br><br>  PS2.  I collect similar links to any interesting notes, news and articles <a href="http://sufx.ru/">in my linkblog</a> , which anyone can write to. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/155707/">https://habr.com/ru/post/155707/</a></p>
