Do you need many resources to start your IT business, if you have a well-coordinated team and remote work skills?  Fast internet and comfortable accommodation may not be all that you need, but you just can't do without it.  Having handed over your accommodation in one corner of the world, you can start working with a team on any part of the globe.  The difference is put in a pocket, and as a bonus, a place is selected next to large start-ups. <br><br>  Garage co-working spaces and cheap offices in the basements are good.  In its own way.  But a young startup sometimes needs something more than just a piece of material space, with protection from wind and rain.  Most apartments are more spacious than the average hotel room.  In the apartments you can live and work at the same time, there is a kitchen, a washing machine, and some owners allow you to keep pets.  And prices.  At first, startups' incomes are minimal, many refuse to pay, trying to save on any little things.  A house in the backwoods for one team can save several thousand dollars a month. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br> <a href="https://www.airbnb.ru/%3Faf%3D20787839%26c%3Dhabrahabr_post"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/f1e/799/614/f1e799614ee24593b52df9483881e88f.jpg"></a> <br>  <i>One of the most unusual places to live is a house of 1 square meter.</i>

      Creative environment?  Ability to communicate with other entrepreneurs?  Travel, in the end, because the code written on the road, always turns out a little bit special.  Such thoughts came to many.  We know dozens (without exaggeration) of cases when start-ups chose Airbnb as ... we do not want to say symbiotes, but close to that. <br><br>  The one who thinks not about himself wins.  Start-upers actively book private housing in many respects because they like the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãa share economy when people use the services of other people.  It seems that you can earn by this scheme only in one way - to rent individual rooms in your own castle or only a sofa in the living room, and live in a dugout yourself or put a yurt in the far north.  At the same time, you will need to invite the photographer to your beautiful castle, to answer the guests' questions, to honestly fill in all the profile data on the site. <br><br> <a href="https://www.airbnb.ru/%3Faf%3D20787839%26c%3Dhabrahabr_post"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/732/e3a/da7/732e3ada74d74e5f9aaa619da4564edb.jpg"></a> <br>  <i>Blackbox Accelerate is a real accelerator in a startup mansion on the territory of Silicon Valley, adapted for long-term living and working.</i> <br><br>  Success stories are built according to different templates, but the most popular scheme looks like this: you have housing and a desire to travel.  The Englishman Graham Hughes has traveled over the past 4 years to 201 countries in the world without using air transport.  His relatives and friends gave him money for the trip.  It is difficult to guess how much over the years a traveler could earn by renting a house.  We know stories about profits in tens of thousands of euros for a short time.  But the point is certainly not in the way of receiving money.  The main thing is to be able to do what you love, using the principles of the economy of life. <br><br>  Airbnb did not invent the economy of the future, but made a contribution to the process that changes our ideas about things that can be monetized.  Going to travel, you are afraid to leave your pets unattended, and flowers without water - this is your idea for a startup, let there be a service to look after animals and flowers.  After the guests need an apartment cleaning - this will be done by specially trained people who will save you time and money.  There are services that provide the ability to leave keys to guests if you are unavailable.  All of these companies may not be related to Airbnb, but use a similar ideology ‚Äî sharing resources that people have accumulated. <br><br> <a href="https://www.airbnb.ru/%3Faf%3D20787839%26c%3Dhabrahabr_post"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/3ec/bda/8cc/3ecbda8cc4aa4c2daaf5e15b71e709c7.jpg"></a> <br>  <i>Future economy services allow everyone to do micro-business.</i> <br><br>  We see articles on the topic ‚Äú <a href="http://thenewyorkbudget.com/2014/05/05/rent-space-airbnb-helped-startup/">How to Make Money with Airbnb and How It Helped My Startup</a> ‚Äù appear on the network with similar thoughts as twins.  Compatriots quickly mastered the material - stories that begin as ‚ÄúA two-room apartment moved to San Francisco and remained free‚Äù and end with the words ‚ÄúAs of today, I received 70+ wonderful guests in Kiev, San Francisco and Sevastopol and earned a little more with Airbnb $ 40,000 ‚Äù( <a href="https://medium.com/%40sidorenkor/40-000-airbnb-e5535cd43f8e">https://medium.com/@sidorenkor/40-000-airbnb-e5535cd43f8e</a> ), continue to appear, fueled by a stir in the real estate market.  As you understand, we support such business models. <br><br>  Some owners are so deeply immersed in the process that start-ups themselves organize.  We were pleased to learn about the <a href="http://www.linkedin.com/today/post/article/20140421182024-82111-airbnb-blooms-an-entire-ecosystem-of-startups">existence of 18 startups</a> , which appeared due to the functioning of the simple Airbnb model.  The ideas laid down in the basics of the service of delivering housing to each other, went beyond the scope of renting real estate, spread throughout the world and affected many other areas of activity. <br><br>  Airbnb helps businesses directly.  Business travel is an extremely conservative direction of business tourism, because employees of companies traditionally follow a certain corporate policy that only works with specific hotel operators or booking systems.  The rules are dictated by the adopted security policy and well-established worldview, which we gradually begin to influence. <br><br>  In the summer of 2014, a special section <a href="https://www.airbnb.ru/business-travel">for business travel</a> was created.  In the new service, the lists of housing options are moderated and verified for Wi-Fi on-site, a booking monitoring system (to avoid double sales) and privacy of premises (guarantees that there will be no outsiders).  Also available is the search for suitable sites for informal meetings with partners and customers.  A very useful feature when you need to decide on a venue for a conference, brainstorming or teamwork. <br><br>  The professional environment always remains tough and demanding in terms of service usability.  Therefore, interaction with it leads to the formation of a uniform quality standard in all parts of the world.  It is really important for us to know how travelers, for whom changing their surroundings is an additional incentive to work, perceive our service.  Therefore, we developed a special section for users ( <a href="http://special.habrahabr.ru/airbnb/">http://special.habrahabr.ru/airbnb/</a> ) with tests, prizes and a live cat.  Take a look and share your opinion in the comments. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/237385/">https://habr.com/ru/post/237385/</a></p>
