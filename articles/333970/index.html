  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Choosing the right HPE Aruba switch for your small or medium business network</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  SMB enterprises planning to purchase new switches need a guarantee that the equipment will not only meet current, but also future requirements.  Consider the factors to consider when choosing the best switch for your business. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/2f1/1df/9c8/2f11df9c8973496b975feafe8ea60ed7.jpg"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  From home to mobile office - anywhere and anytime access to basic applications and information is an absolute must.  New applications and services improve customer interaction and employee productivity, today's users expect reliable connectivity no matter where they are located.  Bad communication does not just cause irritation, it leads to business interruption and loss of productivity. <br>  The networks of small and medium-sized businesses (SMBs) are rapidly changing due to the growing number of mobile devices, the increase in the number of cloud services, and the active use of unified communications and collaboration (UCC) applications by users.  High-speed connections in wireless networks and increased bandwidth requirements for cloud services and UCC applications impose limitations - your switches must meet the performance level of new devices and applications. <br><br>  <font color="#00b882">ACCESS OR ASSOCIATION</font> <br>  Will the switch be used to connect terminals or to aggregate traffic from the access level?  Switches provide the basis for connecting users and equipment to the network; you need to determine the number of end devices, as well as the types of applications and the amount of traffic in it.  Switch functionality can vary from basic L2 to extended L3.  The following are key features to consider when choosing a switch. <br><ul><li>  Scalability: the number of ports and PoE + budget for connecting users, access points and other IP devices </li><li>  Performance: traffic volumes, application types and data transfer rate determine the necessary bandwidth of your switch </li><li>  Network fault tolerance: do you require stacking and / or redundant power supplies </li><li>  Routing: Do you have enough L2 switch without routing, do you need basic L3 with support for static and dynamic routing, or do you need advanced L3 functionality </li><li>  Manageability: Determine if your network needs monitoring and remote control from the cloud, or a multivendor management system that is running locally. </li></ul><br>  <font color="#00b882">PERFORMANCE AND PORT SPEED</font> <br>  You must determine the connection speeds of the end devices and upstream connections.  Most SMB enterprises use Gigabit switches to connect users, while servers and upstream connections may require the ability to combine multiple ports into one logical one and support 10/40 GbE speeds to handle the growing traffic.  Take into account which wireless access points are used and how demanding the applications you use (for example, voice and video).  New wireless access points with support for 802.11ac Wave 2 can serve clients at speeds greater than 1 Gbps, which is why a standard wired Gigabit Ethernet connection can be a deterrent.  To avoid potential problems, you should consider switches with HPE Smart Rate multi-gigabit ports, which allow you to increase speeds up to 2.5 Gbps, 5 Gbps, and even 10 Gbps using existing wired connections.

      <font color="#00b882">PORT PLACEMENT DENSITY</font> <br>  Estimate the required number of ports based on the number of users and devices, as well as the type of connection (wired or wireless).  VoIP and the development of the Internet of Things (IoT) will require more ports. <br><br>  <font color="#00b882">POWER ON NETWORK ETHERNET (POE)</font> <br>  Many devices that connect to access switches, such as VoIP phones, Wi-Fi access points and IP video cameras, can be powered using PoE technology.  For new generations of devices, such as access points with 802.11ac support, it is necessary to have ports with PoE + support in the switchboard, which provide a higher power rating for each device.  It is important to know the power consumption of your devices in order to select a switch with a sufficient PoE budget. <br><br>  <font color="#00b882">STACKING AND BACKING</font> <br>  Stacking switches are preferred where resiliency and network bandwidth are particularly important.  Whether virtual or modular stacking, if one switch fails, your network can quickly recover.  Stacking allows multiple switches to connect to each other via Ethernet connections or dedicated modules and operate as one logical device.  This reduces the number of managed devices, while at the same time improving network resiliency for optimal performance.  Also consider the network availability requirements.  Hot-swappable redundant power supplies and additional control modules will be able to protect important aggregation level switches. <br><br>  <font color="#00b882">READINESS TO SUPPORT IOT AND SDN</font> <br>  One of the most important technological transformations of our time is readiness for loT and software-defined networks (SDN) with the support of OpenFlow v.1.3. <br><br>  <font color="#00b882">CONTROLLABILITY</font> <br>  When choosing a control system, consider which equipment models are used in your network.  For intuitive control of Aruba wired and wireless networks, view cloud solutions using Aruba Central.  For wired and wireless multi-vendor networks, you can choose a local version of the Aruba AirWave control system. <br><br>  <font color="#00b882">INTRODUCTION OF ACCESS NETWORKS FOR SMB ENTERPRISES</font> <br>  An example of a block diagram of an SMB enterprise network is presented in the figure below: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/581/9da/a08/5819daa08084467e83b7c926ef34a4f6.PNG"><br><br>  <font color="#00b882">ARUBA SWITCH SELECTION GUIDE</font> <br>  To facilitate the selection of a suitable model, we suggest you use the following table: <br><br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/e02/c9b/842/e02c9b8423044f82b0918b91e842a831.png"></a> <br><br>  <font color="#00b882">Aruba 2530 Series Switches</font> are economical, reliable, and secure L2 entry-level switches for Mobile First campus networks with centralized control through Aruba AirWave. <br>  <font color="#00b882">Aruba 2540 Series Switches</font> are robust and easy to deploy L2 + access switches that are optimized for mobile device users.
