And if this does not happen, we are shocked and plunged into despondency.  Because of your own persistent beliefs, you can decide to ‚Äúendure‚Äù this instead of taking the necessary actions.  But we all have the right to change in life that which we feel is wrong.  However, it is often difficult to get rid of their beliefs and change the direction of activity.

      If any of the points below about you, most likely, it is time to say goodbye to the current situation.  And change it. <br><br><h2>  <font color="#0071c5">1. You can not rely on your colleagues.</font>  <font color="#0071c5">At all</font> </h2><br>  Maybe the whole thing in an unpleasant office atmosphere.  She, of course, oppresses, but the essence of the case is not.  Think well: when you communicate with colleagues, do not you think that it is unreasonably difficult to understand them?  Do you think that you cannot rely on them for anything?  Or maybe you just ignore them? <br><br>  If this is about you, you are probably working in the wrong area.  And to find "your" sphere, constantly communicate with new people and go for informational interviews.  The latter is an ideal way to talk with someone about a new field of activity for you that may be interesting for you. <br><br><h2>  <font color="#0071c5">2. You spend days at work dreaming of another job.</font> </h2><br>  We all sometimes envy the careers of others a little.  Who would not want to work with celebrities every day or, for example, on a beach in the tropics?  But if you suddenly realize that you would prefer anything else to your office, and especially another office, you should start looking for new work options. <br><br><h2>  <font color="#0071c5">3. You feel that you would like to return time ago, and do not think about the future.</font> </h2><br>  We all sometimes want to turn back the clock and <a href="http://blog.mbaconsult.ru/blog/personal/5-glavnykh-oshibok-ili-pochemu-vashi-ratsionalnye-resheniya-ne-rabotayut/">correct some of our mistakes</a> .  But if you realize that you would like to return to the past in order to choose another career path, everything is not so scary - do not panic and do not fall into despair. <br><br>  If you start everything from scratch, it seems more attractive to you than to continue working in your current field, you should start looking for a new profession or company that will be of interest to you. <br><br>  But if it scares you ... It's not so bad either.  Just don‚Äôt expect anything to change. <br><br><h2>  <font color="#0071c5">4. You do not feel inspired, challenged, creatively elevated and, frankly, you do not feel well at all.</font> </h2><br>  Career must move us forward.  Thanks to suitable work we become more curious, more enthusiastic and strive to develop.  If your work does not give you any of this, try to find a hobby that fills this hole. <br><br>  Be that as it may, the hobbies that you will be engaged in after hours will help you find what you really like, and this does not carry any risks and will potentially lead you to a new job or line of business. <br><br><h2>  <font color="#0071c5">5. You are not interested in improvements (and maybe even hear negative feedback about your work)</font> </h2><br>  Job reviews are an integral part of the career world.  Reviews help to become better and find out about yourself as a professional.  But if the boss constantly complains about your poor performance, you may not be in the right place.  How to improve your performance - here. <br><br>  Of course, sometimes it happens that the task set before you was misunderstood by you, but if you realize that you just don‚Äôt want to grow and become better, it‚Äôs time to move on to something new. <br><br><h2>  <font color="#0071c5">6. You would prefer anything to your work: to treat teeth, to ascend Everest, to be naked on stage</font> </h2><br>  Everyone agrees that a visit to the doctor, especially to the dentist is a very nervous matter.  But even if the stress of waiting for an inspection you prefer to go to work, think well about what caused it. <br><br>  At work, waiting for you too many tasks that you continue to <a href="http://testutor.ru/blog/kak-izlechitsya-ot-bolezni-otkladyvaniya-na-potom-pri-izuchenii-yazykov-ili-prokrastinacii-boj/">postpone until the last moment</a> ?  Are you experiencing stress at work?  Or maybe you just frankly do not like what you do? <br><br><h2>  <font color="#0071c5">7. You spend more time browsing job sites and not at work.</font> </h2><br>  Finding jobs that are interesting to you is a bit of a betrayal of your current job.  There is nothing wrong with that if you do it not very often, just out of interest. <br><br>  But if you are constantly looking for work in which there will be all those advantages that are not enough for the current position, this simply means that your work has not met expectations. <br><br>  Ask yourself if you are able to redefine responsibilities or change jobs so that you like them.  And if you are ready to start something new - it's time not just to look at job openings, but to begin sending out resumes. <br><br><h2>  <font color="#0071c5">8. Your heart is not filled with enthusiasm.</font> </h2><br>  We constantly hear that our work must be enthusiastic and enthusiastic.  Of course, this is important, but let's be honest: work is not always a fairy tale. <br><br>  Sometimes the load is so great that the only thing you want is to pack your things and go home as soon as possible (for a day or forever).  But still, in most of your workdays, you must be filled with enthusiasm, or at least a sense of joy in what you do.  You must feel that you are doing something important and growing up as a professional.  Your heart should let you know that you made the right choice. <br><br>  Regrets about the unsuccessful acquisition for a long time spoil the mood.  But regrets about a poorly chosen career are much worse.  If any of the points described above is about you (and even more so if there are several of them!), It is time to reconsider your life.  Maybe the matter is not even in the wrong career, just in your life the next stage has ended and you are ready for new adventures. <br><br>  To begin with, try to find yourself a new hobby, look for new options of work available to you, go to informational interviews, and if the stars come together in the right way, you will start a new career.  You should not fall into despair if your profession does not suit you, because life is a constant study of something new. <br><br>  PS We recommend another useful article on the topic of work on yourself - <a href="http://testutor.ru/blog/pochemu-nekotorym-lyudyam-vezyot-namnogo-bolshe-chem-drugim/">WHY DO SOME PEOPLE CARRY THIS TO MUCH MORE THAN OTHER?</a> <a href="http://testutor.ru/blog/pochemu-nekotorym-lyudyam-vezyot-namnogo-bolshe-chem-drugim/"><br></a>  . <br>  The author of the translation is Vyacheslav Davidenko, the founder of the <a href="http://testutor.ru/">TESTutor</a> company. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/299496/">https://habr.com/ru/post/299496/</a></p>
