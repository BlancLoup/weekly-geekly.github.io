Suffice it to recall only the transition from gas burners and gas cylinders to a public service to provide gas.  Such examples provide us with an understanding of how the uniqueness of the technology is gradually gaining mass, turning into a service. <br>  More recently, literally 20 years ago, the share of using information technologies in business was less than 5-10%.  Now - almost 100%.  The transition from uniqueness to scale makes it possible to perceive the computing power not as a separate computer server, standing in the building of the organization, but as a service that is provided by some distant data center. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Actually, this is why cloud computing is called a new trend in the development of information technology.  That is why many companies are beginning to understand the importance and necessity of ‚Äúgoing to the cloud‚Äù.  And that is why now it is necessary to carry out research projects in this area.  This work is the first steps to analyze cloud computing, their applicability in the Internet business in the current reality.  What is cloud computing?  What advantages do they present in comparison with other similar technologies?  Why are ‚Äúclouds‚Äù of particular importance when applied to Internet startups?  I will try to answer these questions in this paper.

      <u><b>1. Basic concepts of cloud computing technology</b></u> <u><br></u> <br>  <b>1.1.</b>  <b>What is a "cloud"?</b> <br>  First, how should we understand the term ‚Äúcloud computing‚Äù?  What does it mean by ‚Äúcloud‚Äù?  Correctly understand the "cloud" as a metaphor for a remote computing data center, which is granted access based on pay-as-you-go (pay for the actual use of the computing service).  Thus, the software is actually provided to the user as a service.  The cloud computing user doesn‚Äôt need to take care of the infrastructure or the actual software; the cloud successfully hides all the technical and software details. <br>  It should be noted that in this report cloud technologies are considered only in relation to the b2b model.  Analysis of the applicability of their application to end users in this work is not carried out. <br><br>  <b>1.2.</b>  <b>History reference</b> <br>  The first ideas about using computing as a public service were proposed back in the 1960s by well-known information technology scientist, inventor of the Lisp language, professor at MIT and Stanford University, John McCarthy.  The emergence of the first technology, close to the modern understanding of the term "cloud computing", is attributed to the company Salesforce.com, founded in 1999.  It was then that the first proposal of a new type of b2b product ‚ÄúSoftware as a Service‚Äù (‚ÄúSoftware as a Service‚Äù, ‚ÄúSaaS‚Äù) appeared.  Salesforce has had some success in this area and has aroused interest among the IT giants, who hastily reported on their research in the field of cloud technology.  And now the first business solution called ‚ÄúAmazon Web Services‚Äù was launched in 2005 by Amazon.com, which has been actively involved in upgrading its data centers since the dotcom crisis.  The next technology was gradually introduced by Google, starting with 2006 a b2b SaaS service called Google Apps, and then a platform as a service as a service (PaaS) called Google App Engine.  And finally, Microsoft announced its proposal, presenting it at the PDC 2008 conference under the name Azure Services Platform. <br>  The very fact of high interest of the largest IT market players demonstrates a certain status of cloud computing as a trend of 2009-2010.  In addition, with the release of the Microsoft Azure Service Platform, many experts are connecting the new round of web technology development and bringing the entire cloud computing industry to the next level. <br>  <b>1.3.</b>  <b>Technological aspects of the "cloud"</b> <br>  At the moment, most cloud infrastructures are deployed on data center servers using virtualization technologies, which in fact allows any user application to use computing power without thinking about the technological aspects at all.  Then you can understand the "cloud" as a single access to computing by the user. <br>  The concept of cloud computing is often associated with such services providing (Everything as a service) technologies such as ‚ÄúSoftware as a Service‚Äù (‚ÄúSoftware as a Service‚Äù or ‚ÄúSaaS‚Äù), ‚ÄúInfrastructure as a Service‚Äù or ‚ÄúIaaS‚Äù) and Platform as a Service (‚ÄúPlaatform as a Service‚Äù, ‚ÄúPaaS‚Äù).  Consider each of these technologies in more detail. <br>  SaaS is an application deployment model that involves providing an application to the end user as an on-demand service.  Access to such an application is carried out through the network, and most often through an Internet browser. <br>  IaaS is a model for providing computer infrastructure as a service.  Instead of buying servers, software, special network equipment, the user can receive these resources in the form of outsourcing (outsource).  In fact, as many experts note, this is just some evolution of hosting services. <br>  PaaS is a network-based computing platform as a service model that offers deployment and support for web applications and services without the need to purchase and manage hardware and software layers. <br>  Thus, these technologies, when used together, allow cloud computing users to take advantage of the computing power and data storage, which are provided to them as services through certain virtualization technologies and a high level of abstraction. <br><br>  <b>2. The advantages of the "cloud"</b> <br>  As mentioned above, many IT experts believe that in the near future, cloud computing will be included in the top list of technological trends.  In any case, for such a bold statement there must be certain reasons why cloud computing will soon be chosen by many Internet businesses.  Thus, we will try to analyze the benefits of cloud technologies. <br>  First, it is a high level of virtualization.  As mentioned above, a user, having deployed his application, does not think about such problems as hardware, their support, or specific software installed on the machine.  He does not even think about which, or even on which machines his application is executed. <br>  The ability to run multiple copies of an application on many virtual machines represents the benefits of scalability: the number of instances of an application can almost instantly increase on demand, depending on the load. <br>  And finally, the data centers are managed by professional experts who provide round-the-clock support for the operation of virtual machines.  And even if the physical machine ‚Äúcollapses‚Äù, thanks to the distribution of the application into multiple copies, it will still continue its work.  This creates a certain high level of reliability and resiliency of the system. <br>  However, it should be noted that in the eyes of consumers of the service, the main advantage of cloud computing is, perhaps, the absence of the need to purchase all the relevant equipment and software, and then to support their work.  We will look at this aspect a bit later in conjunction with an analysis of applications in the field of Internet startups. <br>  Thus, all these advantages determine the choice of cloud computing compared to other similar technologies.  They are the ones who ‚Äúpush‚Äù further development of the largest IT corporations, which also see an increased interest among system users.  Most likely, in the near future we will see, if not a surge of scientific and practical activity in the sphere of cloud computing, then certainly a gradual increase in a certain interest. <br>  <b>3. Cloud computing issues</b> <br>  It would seem that the benefits of cloud computing are so obvious that all companies will massively switch to using this type of technology in the near future.  However, there are some problems faced by both cloud computing vendors and business users. <br>  First, as mentioned in Dmitry Petrov‚Äôs ‚ÄúCounter Plan‚Äù article [6], there is practically no definite culture of consumption of outsourcing services, business refers to such services somewhat wary.  ‚ÄúThe reasons for the incredulous attitude of small and medium businesses to data centers may be several.  Most likely, this is a fear of losing control over IT resources, concerns about the guarantee of security and protection of the transmitted information and the presentation of the data center only as a platform for the placement of equipment. ‚Äù <br>  Thus, vendors of cloud computing services should understand the importance of creating customer awareness of the service, as well as a sense of security of their own data. <br>  Secondly, some experts, such as G. Macleod (Hugh Macleod) in the article ‚ÄúThe Most Well-Protected Secret of the Clouds‚Äù [8], argue that cloud computing leads to the creation of a huge, unprecedented monopoly.  Is it possible?  Of course, in the cloud computing market, in order to place any information in the cloud, for which information security rules exist, companies will most likely use such vendors whose name is ‚Äúheard‚Äù and whom they trust.  Thus, there is a certain danger that all calculations and data will be aggregated in the hands of one super monopoly.  However, at the moment there are already several companies on the market with approximately the same high level of trust from customers (Microsoft, Google, Amazon), and there are no facts that would indicate that one company can dominate all the others.  Therefore, in the near future, the emergence of a global super company that will coordinate and control all the calculations in the world is very unlikely, although the mere possibility of such an event scares away some customers. <br>  Thirdly, the state in whose territory the data center is located can get access to any information that is stored in it.  For example, according to the laws of the United States, where the largest number of data centers is located, in this case, the provider company does not even have the right to disclose the fact of the transfer of confidential information to anyone other than their lawyers [12]. <br>  This problem is probably one of the most significant in the issue of confidential information in the cloud.  There may be several ways to solve it.  First, you can encrypt all information placed on the cloud.  Secondly, you can simply not put it there.  However, in any case, for companies using cloud computing, this should be a specific item on the list of information security issues.  In addition, the providers themselves need to improve their technology by providing some encryption services. <br>  Thus, certain problems exist, but almost all of them are concentrated in the field of incorrect or inadequate understanding of the technology and the possibilities of its use.  And only the problem of unlimited access of the state to the information stored in the data center, in my opinion, is currently the most difficult to solve and the most limiting users of cloud computing technology. <br><br>  <u><b>4. Features of the functioning of an Internet startup</b></u> <br><br>  <b>4.1.</b>  <b>Features of a startup company</b> <br>  Strange as it may seem, in some circles, sometimes even professional ones, the term ‚Äústartup‚Äù is perceived rather ambiguously.  Therefore, for further consideration should define this term.  So, a startup is a newly created company, perhaps even not officially registered, which builds its business on the basis of innovations.  Such a company only enters the market and is at the stage of development and marketing research. <br>  A start-up company is often called a garage, and here's why.  Traditionally, start-ups were created under rather difficult circumstances, in conditions of extremely limited resources.  Therefore, such companies are often limited to the minimum investment: primitive offices in the form of garages, possibly free software, and so on. <br>  There is a basic rule for the existence of a startup, which is the empirical result of the functioning of such companies: ‚ÄúScale fast or fail fast‚Äù.  A startup can either instantly ‚Äúsoar‚Äù upward, or just as quickly ‚Äúfail‚Äù.  This rule is worth remembering for both start-up startups and investors who understand not only the high risks of investments, but also a possible ultra-high return.  As we will find out a little later, it is also useful for choosing the technological model used. <br><br>  <b>4.2.</b>  <b>Startups during the economic crisis</b> <br>  In my opinion, in the modern economic environment, during the World economic and financial crisis, the role of startups is greater than ever.  First, they are strongly consumer-oriented, in contrast to the ‚Äúcumbersome‚Äù giants of the industry, who are engaged in reducing costs and ‚Äúsqueezing‚Äù projects.  In a new economic situation, startups are able to find their niche with super-profits. <br>  Secondly, the appreciation of money has led to a rather strong decrease in investments, which will now be directed to those who can use them as efficiently as possible.  Therefore, I believe that shortly after the crisis, the economy, including the Russian one, will face a noticeable boom in startups, for example, in the Internet industry.  Such companies will be interested in technologies that are able to demonstrate the maximum return on investment spent.  That is why I predict a massive increase in the role of cloud technologies for Internet startups. <br><br>  <u><b>5. Internet startup in the cloud</b></u> <br><br>  <b>5.1.</b>  <b>Benefits of Internet startups in the cloud</b> <br>  As mentioned above, startups are interested in maximizing the impact of the technologies used.  That is why an Internet startup launched into the cloud acquires a completely new competitive advantage.  But which ones? <br>  Firstly, the payment for the use of cloud technology in the ‚Äúpay as you go‚Äù system allows start-up companies to significantly reduce fixed or capital costs. <br>  Figure 1 shows the costs incurred by start-ups in the case of using traditional technologies and in the case of ‚Äúswitching to the cloud‚Äù.  In the first variant, a company needs a certain amount of investments to start up, which will go towards redemption of fixed costs (Fixed Costs, FC on the chart): purchase of servers and software, their support and maintenance.  With an increase in the number of users, variables are proportionally added to the fixed costs (Variable Costs, VC on the graph). <br>  The situation is quite different when using cloud computing.  When you start a startup, you do not need to invest in the purchase of hardware and software, just in the future when you increase the number of users you pay a little more in accordance with your contract for the provision of cloud computing services. <br><img src="http://xmages.net/out.php/i232637_gr1.jpg" alt="image"><br>  Fig.  one <br>  (Sam Johnston idea, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File">en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File</a> : Cloud_computing_economics.svg) <br><br>  In fact, this graph looks a little different.  When you buy your own server and install the corresponding software on it, an increase in the number of users increases costs at a slower rate than when you pay for the consumption of the calculation service (Fig. 2).  However, it should be remembered that there are certain scalability problems that do not allow us to adapt to new needs when the load increases rapidly (Fig. 3).  Then, when reaching a certain critical point of users (dotted on the graph), work on scalability will be required, which will take a certain time, during which the number of users will not increase, or may decrease. <br><img src="http://xmages.net/out.php/i232638_gr2.jpg" alt="image"><br>  Fig.  2 <br><img src="http://xmages.net/out.php/i232639_gr3.jpg" alt="image"><br>  Fig.  3 <br>  Thus, the advantage of cloud technologies in the form of a lack of capital expenditures are of particular importance for Internet startups, which are in dire need of initial capital and investment.  When using cloud computing services, startups start their business, as a rule, with a minimum level of investment, which usually easily covers low barriers to entry. <br>  Second, let's remember the startup rule, fail fast or scale fast.     ,        ,          :     .              .          ,        ,          . <br> -,        ,       - . ,    ,     ,           . <br>  ,        - . ,   ,            ,        . <br><br> <u><b>6.  ,    </b></u> <br>         .        ,       b2b ,     -   . <br><br> <b><u><a href="http://azure.com/">azure.com</a></u></b> <br> <b>Azure Services Platform</b> ‚Äì        ,      -   .      ¬´   ¬ª   Windows Azure,          Microsoft.
