  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Russian equipment. Part 2. LANTASTIK</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  In the first part, I talked about <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/telecom/77693/">M-Link'i</a> - Russian E1-Ethernet converters, which have been in my hands.  Now it will be a question of products of the Petersburg company <a href="http://www.optica.ru/">"Optical TeleSystems"</a> . <br>  LANTASTIKA-2Speed ‚Äã‚Äã- the so-called "adaptive broadband wireless optical communication system."  The name <s>hides the secret meaning of</s> the device's function - to convert ordinary Ethernet to infrared waves. <br><img src="http://img2.pict.com/6d/75/88/2232559/0/6.jpg" alt="LANtastIKa"><br><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h5>  Iron </h5><br>  From the technical passport it becomes clear that there are three products of this series LANTASIKA BOX 100M-AC1, BOX 100M-AC3, BOX 100M-AC3 (BOX = Wireless Optical Communication Channels).  They differ in their characteristics.  In fact, this is reflected in the distance at which the devices can operate.  So AC3 can be located at a maximum distance of 480 km from each other, according to those.  passport.  Frankly speaking, outer space and automatic alignment systems appear immediately - work at such distances is achievable only under ideal conditions. <br>  The device consists of a receiving module (a large lens in the middle), two transmitting modules (on the sides of the main one), a protective casing and a leg of attachment.  Fastening is possible to a vertical or horizontal surface.  At the end of the foot is a ball to which a casing is attracted by a ring with four bolts.  This mount provides a rough adjustment to the remote side (the same device is located on the other side).  There are two horizontal adjustment bolts on the cover, one vertically and one fixing bolt. <br><br><img src="http://img2.pict.com/3f/2f/67/2232557/0/800/5.jpg" alt="Fix">

      On the back wall of the central lens there are 4 signal strength indicators, a power indicator, indicators of local and remote synchronization, an Ethernet link indicator, cable leads and a hole for mounting the sight.  Local synchronization indicator means that the device sees the signal from the other side.  If it is lit in red - the connection speed is 10 Mb / s, green - 100 Mb / s.  A burning indicator of remote synchronization indicates that the opposite side sees the beam and sent a signal about this to the local one. <br><br><img src="http://img2.pict.com/0c/75/9a/2232568/0/800/8.jpg" alt="Back"><br><br>  A power cable and shielded twisted pair are suitable for the device.  Included is a 220V power supply (it is also possible to connect directly to a 48V power source), a pre-targeting device (sight), adjusting screws, a switching box with a plinth, a grounding bus and power connectors, and a box with two ports: for data transfer ( green and orange pairs) and for control (RS232, blue pair and screen).  In the photo, this is the box. <br><br><img src="http://img2.pict.com/fa/bc/46/2232571/0/800/9.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><h5>  Difficulties </h5><br>  We figured out the first port quickly, but using the screen as an extra pair was something new (perhaps again the cost of a little experience).  The most interesting was the use of a brown pair.  It is needed to update the firmware LANTASTIKI and more for nothing.  For correct operation, the pair should not be closed.  I did not know this, and so that the pair would not hang out, I hammered it into the plinth.  From the plinth, the steam went into the box, where it was not clogged, respectively, and was not closed anywhere, thus even if the condition unknown at that time was satisfied.  For a long time we puzzled over this, nothing worked.  And it did not work until the pairs in the switch box were removed from the skirting board.  Suppliers could not comment on the situation.  Just LANTASTIKA some. <br>  The device is designed to work in the harsh Siberian conditions: from -50 to +50 at any humidity.  Tests at -30 passed safely.  But the snow falls safely on the lens.  So far there have been no problems, but it may be necessary to clean it periodically. <br>  Another problem is synchronization.  Perhaps, precisely because this is the first experience, my colleagues and I spent a few days on the alignment.  The algorithm was as follows: first, using an optical sight, point LANTASTIKA to the opposite point, fix the bolts of a coarse adjustment, then use a fine tuning bolts to move along the S-shaped (more accurate snake-like) trajectory until the person on the other side sees the red spot with his own eyes .  The devices were at a distance of about 500 meters.  At this distance, the spot diameter is about 70 cm. This can be seen if you move from place to place: at a certain moment a clear red spot disappears.  Then we called the person on the other side on the phone how and where to move. <br><br><h5>  Accidents </h5><br>  The adjustment process (the roof of a 12-story building, -5-7 with the wind) was interrupted once by children's cries.  This picture appeared to me: <br><br><img src="http://img2.pict.com/7f/0b/3b/2232553/0/800/4.jpg" alt="Child"><br><br>  In the photo you can see people in black with a camera.  What could it be? <br><br><h5>  Software </h5><br>  Now let's touch the command line interface.  Unfortunately, it is in Russian, which I consider unacceptable in professional technology.  Accordingly, there are problems with the encoding, which, incidentally, are easily solved. <br><br><img src="http://img2.pict.com/7a/5f/73/2232536/0/2.jpg" alt="Decoding"><br><br>  The first page contains basic information on configuration commands.  As I said above, there are two modes of operation 10 and 100 Mb / s, which are configured by the commands <b>SA</b> (automatic mode), <b>S10</b> and <b>S100</b> .  If different modes are configured on opposite devices, it will not be possible to achieve synchronization (by personal hard experience). <br><br><img src="http://img2.pict.com/92/1d/aa/2232535/0/1.jpg" alt="Main"><br><br>  The <b>m</b> command allows you to view current indicators, such as synchronization mode, Ethernet link, lens temperature, transmission loss, signal level, and others.  If there is synchronization between devices, then data is displayed for both sides. <br><br><img src="http://img2.pict.com/eb/49/72/2232542/0/3.jpg" alt="m"><br><br>  The port on the computer rises only if some device is also connected on the other side. <br>  Unfortunately, remote control of the device is impossible, as well as monitoring - you need to go to the site. <br>  During the short testing period (two weeks), the connection between the devices has already been lost twice.  After the first time everything was restored by itself, in the second it was necessary to leave and correct the direction a little.  But I think this is due to the mechanical impact on the installation surface or the drawdown of the structure - testing continues.  According to the manufacturer, rain and snow should not interfere with work; fog can degrade the quality.  The test of the snow LANTASTIKA passed.  For the rest, so far no complaints.  Its almost 100 Mb / s LANTASTIK almost fulfills ( <a href="http://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iperf">iperf</a> test showed 80-90 Mb / s).  This Russian joy is worth around 300,000 rubles per pair. <br><br><h5>  According to the manufacturer </h5><br>  LANTASTIKA-3Speed ‚Äã‚Äãalready promises an Ethernet 1000 Base-TX connection, having its own IP address, access via telnet and even a web interface. <br>  The manufacturer claims absolute safety of the devices (although somewhere in the documentation it is said that one should avoid accidental eye contact) and there is no need to license the use of devices. <br>  The documentation is excellent.  Everything is described in detail and clearly, up to the characteristics of the necessary tools.  Separately noted are such notes as: ‚Äúwithout dropping, completely unscrew the fixing screw together with the spherical washer on all modules‚Äù.  For minor bugs and spelling errors, you can still close your eyes. <br><br><h5>  A bit away from the topic </h5><br>  &lt;What did I want to say with this post?  What we have our development.  Maybe it is sometimes worth paying attention to them?&gt; </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/78589/">https://habr.com/ru/post/78589/</a></p>
