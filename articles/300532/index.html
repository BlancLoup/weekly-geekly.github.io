In the first quarter of 2015, the market showed no decline or growth. <br><br>  However, according to <a href="http://www.iksconsulting.ru/">iKS-Consulting</a> , for the whole of 2015, the revenue from business communication services for the first time decreased by 1.5-2%, to 148 billion rubles.  While in 2014, revenue increased by 1.5%.  The decline in revenue, CEO of iKS-Consulting, Maxim Savvatin, explained the reduction of corporate clients' expenses for communication due to the crisis. <br><br>  According to him, in 2015, revenues from corporate telephone communications fell by about 5%.  This fall softened the growth in revenue from data services for corporate clients by about 4%, Savvatin notes.

In the fourth quarter, the decline was more serious - 21% year-on-year, in particular, due to a decrease in revenues in the corporate segment, follows from the company's report. <br><br>  Although the revenues of <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%259C%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B1%25D0%25B8%25D0%25BB%25D1%258C%25D0%25BD%25D1%258B%25D0%25B5_%25D0%25A2%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BB%25D0%25B5%25D0%25A1%25D0%25B8%25D1%2581%25D1%2582%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BC%25D1%258B">MTS</a> in the mass market of wired communications in 2015 increased by 3.1% to 29.8 billion rubles, this growth did not compensate for the decrease in revenue in the corporate market, in the segment of government orders and inter-operator services to 31.8 billion rubles (- 5 , 4%), <a href="http://www.vedomosti.ru/technology/articles/2016/04/29/639666-spad-rossiiskom-rinke">write</a> "Vedomosti" with reference to the company's statements. <br><br>  In 2015, <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%259C%25D0%25B5%25D0%25B3%25D0%25B0%25D0%25A4%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BD">MegaFon</a> launched new services for businesses based on cloud and M2M technologies, which stimulated the growth of customer interest in existing services.  The most popular service was 8-800, showing a 4-fold increase in revenue.  Services ‚ÄúRemote Management of Objects‚Äù and ‚ÄúVirtual PBX‚Äù showed an increase in revenue of about 32%, and the M2M-service ‚ÄúPersonnel Control‚Äù - 48%. <br><br>  Over the year, MegaFon <a href="http://www.cnews.ru/news/line/2016-04-25_megafon_uvelichil_na_30_korporativnuyu_abonentskuyu">increased</a> by 30% the corporate subscriber base and the number of active mobile Internet users in the regions of the North Caucasus Federal District.  In MegaFon's networks in the Stavropol region and the regions of the North Caucasus, the volume of Internet traffic consumed by corporate subscribers increased by 1.5 times, and the revenue growth from data services in the B2B segment was 12%. <br><br>  MegaFon achieved such results not only due to the active development of 4G networks, but also due to the operational modernization of 3G communication facilities.  At the same time, the largest growth of Internet traffic consumption among business subscribers is observed in the Chechen Republic - more than 300%, and the number of mobile Internet users in this region increased by 130%.  Residents of Dagestan, where the volume of traffic grew by 290%, and Karachay-Cherkessia - 145% turned out to be a little less active. <br><br>  Despite the crisis, the computer park in Russian companies is still growing, business process automation continues, says analyst at TMT Consulting, Kirill Tatus. <br><br>  The number of companies that in 2015 were connected to the Internet at speeds in excess of 2 Mbit / s increased year by year by 8 pp, to 65%.  The number of subscribers connected at speeds of 10-100 Mbit / s increased from 17 to 23%, the analyst cites data citing the Ministry of Communications. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/300532/">https://habr.com/ru/post/300532/</a></p>
