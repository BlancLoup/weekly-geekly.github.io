The project to create a new type of transport infrastructure looked very promising.  The company recently conducted <a href="https://geektimes.ru/post/275656/">test tests of</a> the ‚Äútrain‚Äù model.  With the leadership of Hyperloop One, other companies began to negotiate cooperation.  The head of Hyperloop also visited Russia, <a href="https://geektimes.ru/post/277550/">where he met with the heads of</a> 18 domestic companies.  This meeting was attended by President Vladimir Putin.  At the meeting, we talked about the possible creation of a new transport route in Moscow.  We talked about the creation of a highway Russia-China in the distant future.

      But today it became known that its co-founder Brogan Bambrogan, who previously held the post of Hyperloop technical director, <a href="https://ru.scribd.com/document/318117176/318104461-HyperLoop">sued the</a> company. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  In a lawsuit, Bambrogan argues that his colleagues are guilty of financial irregularities, threats, including physical violence, as well as the marginalization of many company employees.  All this, according to the plaintiff, threatens the future of the company.  He accuses several people at once, including CEO Rob Lloyd, co-founder of the company Sherwin Pishevar and his brother Afshin Pishevar, in promoting their own brands, improving their lives and filling their pockets (theirs and family members) through Hyperloop.  Now the total investment raised by Hyperloop is $ 92 million. <br><br>  In mid-June, Bambrogan left the company without any explanation.  A few days before his dismissal, Afshin Pishevar, the brother of the co-founder of the company, also left the company (now he continues to work in Hyperloop).  Bambrogan officially asked for state protection.  In California, such a request means a request to "protect a person from violence, harassment, harassment, or threats of violence."  Bambrogan claims that former colleagues repeatedly threatened him with violence.  He says that Afshin Pishevar left a loop on his chair.  Security cameras recorded all this.  ‚ÄúThe promise was clear,‚Äù the lawsuit says. <br><br>  Bambrogan accuses his colleagues of clandestine, claiming that they took either relatives or good friends to senior positions.  Someone from the employees of the PR-department Pishevar allegedly paid $ 15,000 a month "as a friend."  Only after the friendship ended the wedding, the contract was terminated. <br><br>  A former technical director said that the company's management was very bad at employees.  For example, Assistant General Counsel David Pendergast was fired in the office in front of his wife and children, who visited Pendergast at work. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/72d/09d/a65/72d09da65fdf9f3225ed01c64f34665e.jpg"><br>  Brogan Bambrogan (left) and Shervin Pishevar (right) tell about the future of the project <br><br>  Another accusation concerns Shervin Peshevar and his personal foundation, Sherpa Capital.  Bambrogan argues that Peshevar urged the company's investors to invest in this fund for "direct access to their funds."  Investors with a reputation could be refused if a friend of the management expressed a desire to cooperate. <br><br>  A month earlier, Bambrogan, along with 10 other employees, wrote a letter to Pishevaru stating that their work was ‚Äúseriously underestimated,‚Äù and Shervin Pishevar himself gained global control over the company, which he ‚Äúdoes not fully understand.‚Äù  It is alleged that Pishevar dishonestly seized 90% of the company.  Bambrogan, according to his own words, received only 6%. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/8a9/854/fbb/8a9854fbb57fe0575fa6ea87314714c6.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  The letter sent to Pishevara, according to its drafters, was the last attempt to bring the situation under control.  The message was sent on May 26th.  In two weeks, Bambrogan was to meet with investors from Russia.  Instead, he did not go anywhere, telling his partners that he was staying in California.  He also <a href="https://www.buzzfeed.com/nitashatiku/departed-hyperloop-one-cofounder-claims-harassment-by-former%3Futm_term%3D.nnLb636eP">informed them about the problems in the company</a> .  The same loop in the photo above appeared on Bambrogan's chair after Pishevar learned that his colleague had told the company about the problems in the company to these investors.  Pishevar himself flew to their meeting and was very surprised by questions about the problems in Hyperloop. <br><br>  All this is more like a plot for a soap opera, but the case will be considered as early as this Thursday in the Los Angeles County Superior Court. <br><br>  A few days ago, Hyperloop One seemed prosperous.  Her things went better and better.  In May, the company received more than $ 80 million in investment to develop its transport system.  In June, an agreement was concluded with the Russian government - Pishevar attended this meeting.  Last month, Bambrogan himself said that Hyperloop tunnels could be built underground and even under water. <br><br>  Initially, the company and its plans were skeptical.  But after receiving a number of investments, successful testing, and Pishevara meeting with Russian companies and Vladimir Putin, the critics have been silenced. <br><br>  Bambrogan went to Hyperloop from Tesla Motors.  His presence in the new company also allowed Hyperloop One to get some credibility from investors.  His departure from the company has somewhat reduced this credibility, and the lawsuit can put an end to everything that has been done before.  No matter how the court session goes, such revelations from the technical director and the fact of the incident threaten the existence of Hyperloop One.  Understand who is right and who will blame the court. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/395905/">https://habr.com/ru/post/395905/</a></p>
