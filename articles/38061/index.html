  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Internet Marketing. Perspectives</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Recently, when I communicate with people who want to improve their business through Internet marketing, they ask me a question of something like the following: <br><blockquote>  Do not you think that all advertising on the Internet does not work, and such things as viral marketing, hidden marketing, contextual advertising, etc. are becoming less and less effective with each day, as users develop a kind of immunity, and they all they let pass by themselves, and if they notice, they develop a negative attitude towards the brand, saying <em>‚Äú</em> They <em>are trying to push me again‚Äù</em> ? </blockquote><br><br>  The question arises so often, so I want to talk about the prospect of advertising, marketing and PR on the Internet. <br><a name="habracut"></a>  Read more <br>  So, in Russia already 32.7 million people use the Internet (according to the Public Opinion Foundation as of February 2008), that is, almost a third of the population (29%, a six-month audience).  In this case, the bulk of users are people from large cities aged 18 to 34 years.  In large cities, 73% of young people aged 18-24 and 57% of people aged 25-34 use the Internet.  Often, these people do not watch television in general, and all information is received on the Net.  That is, television advertising, which costs a lot, unlike the other, has low sampling capabilities, does not affect the most paying part of the population - young people aged 20 to 33 years. <br><br>  Remember how many times a day you look at billboards, <a href="http://ablohin.ru/dictionary/brandmauer">firewalls</a> , other outdoor advertising?  And how many brands do you call, advertising on the street which you saw yesterday?  <em>‚ÄúSuch advertising acts on the subconscious and when making decisions, it will also be taken into account,‚Äù</em> you say?  Maybe.  But this is not exactly what the advertiser wants.

      So, what are the benefits of advertising on the Internet?  Here are the main reasons for the growth of online advertising, which highlights David Hallerman, senior analyst at Bernstein Research: <br><ul><li>  online advertising has much greater measuring capabilities than other types of advertising, and it is very suitable for advertisers; </li><li>  Internet audience is huge; </li><li>  Internet advertising prices are rising, but this is due to the introduction of targeting and other techniques: with their development, advertisers will invest in online advertising even more willingly. </li></ul><br><br>  From here it is possible to single out two advantages, in my opinion, the most significant.  These are audience and targeting: <br><ol><li>  <strong>Lecture hall</strong> <br><br>  As I have already said, the core of Internet users is a solvent audience, which is difficult to reach through TV, radio and outdoor advertising. <br><br>  There are a lot of people on the Internet.  This breaks the boundaries of communication and we can ask the opinion of many strangers who tell the truth - they have nothing to fear, the Internet is anonymous.  Therefore, a service such as ‚ÄúHidden marketing in forums and blogs‚Äù will grow and develop. <br><br>  The Internet is an entertainment tool.  No wonder there are many entertainment sites.  Therefore, viral marketing, when in the information that users will share to insert an advertising message, will also flourish, but its level will rise several times. </li><li>  <strong>Targeting</strong> <br><br>  Users on the network are easy enough to target. <br><br>  Soon, social networks will sell all the data to advertising agencies (now they also sell, but not all and not all).  That is, you indicate in the interests of the word "cars", and you will be shown advertising cars.  Only not all.  They will also calculate your income level and will offer appropriate cars.  And if you are 17 years old, they will not be at all - how many cars in the interests do not indicate.  You are not the target audience. <br><br>  Everything is analyzed: what sites you visit, your search queries, your age and place of residence.  In our company, even this joke appeared: <br>  You enter in the search system <em>‚Äúdownload windows for free‚Äù</em> , and then the context ‚ÄúLicensed software‚Äù is sent to you and spam comes to the relevant mail. </li></ol><br><br>  With the help of the Internet, any person who begins to think something can start a blog and become a mass media outlet.  This does not neglect the companies creating corporate blogs, including <a href="http://ablohin.ru/dictionary/korporativnyj-blog-insajder">blog insiders</a> . <br><br>  Another plus in the direction of advertising on the Internet is each time tougher restrictions on outdoor and television advertising.  Alcohol and pharmaceutical companies are beginning to gradually move to the Internet. <br><br>  Internet advertising and internet marketing budgets are growing.  In Germany, the online advertising market has already overtaken the radio advertising market (according to the consulting company Nilsen Media Research). <br><br>  Here, it seems, you need to somehow finish it, but until I will.  The topic, as it seems to me, is not fully disclosed, therefore, to be continued. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/38061/">https://habr.com/ru/post/38061/</a></p>
