And even if you use a variety of anonymizers, there is a chance of leakage of your real IP and indirect data, allowing you to learn more about you than you would like.  The browser is an important link in the chain called "anonymity." <br><br><a name="habracut"></a>  <font color="gray">With a probability of 0.234 under the cut photo of a naked woman</font> <br>  Well, not this time. <br><br clear="all">  Let's start, perhaps, with a review of existing solutions, then we will gradually move on to how to do everything yourself.  Well, in the end, of course, company news. <br><br><h3>  Browsar </h3><br>  The first "lucky", which I discovered on the Internet, was Browsar.  The browser can be downloaded for free, and the installation file takes up only 210 kilobytes, which even before downloading led to bad thoughts about the presence of a trick.  So it happened.

    <h4>  pros </h4><ul><li>  The developer declares that the history of visited pages, Cookies, temporary Flash and Java data is erased without the possibility of recovery after finishing work with the browser. </li></ul><h4>  Minuses </h4><ul><li>  After downloading it turned out that this is not a browser at all, but an odd job, in fact, being just another shell over Internet Explorer. </li><li>  It turned out that the program is not much more anonymous than the same regular Internet Explorer, and does not add any new features, except for the "anti-boss" button and pop-up blocking, which, by the way, is already present in all normal browsers. </li><li>  It's clear that there can be no open source speech. </li><li>  It works only under Windows. </li></ul><h4>  And where can I download this wonderful product?  <sup>(hello to masochists!)</sup> </h4><br>  <a href="http://www.browzar.com/">http://www.browzar.com/</a> <br><br><h3>  Operator YAPO </h3><br>  Quite a good build of the Opera browser.  It can be seen that with the soul. <br><br><h4>  pros </h4><ul><li>  Based on the relatively new build of Opera - 10.52. </li><li>  Portable, installed on a flash drive or hard drive. </li><li>  By default, it erases all session data after exiting. </li><li>  You can configure it so that after you exit the desired data is saved. </li></ul><h4>  Minuses </h4><ul><li>  The data that you still want to save is not stored in a cryptocontainer.  The minus is irrelevant in most cases for home use or when using special programs that encrypt data. </li><li>  Opera, and, accordingly, the assembly is distributed without open source codes.  Hello paranoid! </li><li>  It works only under Windows. </li></ul>  I would like to note that there are certain problems and security holes in the browser when using a proxy or Tor, for example, de-anonymization when entering a link like nntp: // or through a special web page that uses the fact that addresses like http: // number in some cases, they can be interpreted as a decimal representation of the IP address and the connection occurs bypassing the proxy settings. <br><br>  When using VPN, fortunately, such problems do not arise. <br><br><h4>  Where can I download </h4><br>  <a href="http://archetwist.com/en/opera/operator">http://archetwist.com/en/opera/operator</a> <br><br><h3>  Comodo Dragon Internet Browser </h3><br>  Comodo Browser based on the free Chromium project. <br><br><h4>  pros </h4><ul><li>  More advanced, as promised by the developers, compared to Chromium, the protection of confidential data. </li><li>  Anonymous surfing mode, when working in which the browser does not save any traces on the computer.  In general, as in Chromium. </li></ul><h4>  Minuses </h4><ul><li>  Although Chromium is free software, the Comodo browser source, oddly enough, is closed. </li><li>  It works only under Windows. </li></ul><h4>  Where can I download </h4><br>  <a href="http://www.comodo.com/home/browsers-toolbars/browser.php">http://www.comodo.com/home/browsers-toolbars/browser.php</a> <br><br><h3>  Read?  And now we do everything in our own way. </h3><br>  In general, the list of browsers could be added to infinity, but the essence remains the same - the source is closed, it does not work everywhere, it is not portable. <br><br>  What is left to do?  Build your browser from plugins, of course! <br><br><h4>  Mozilla firefox </h4><br>  <a href="http://www.mozilla.com/ru/firefox/">Download the</a> latest official version of this browser.  You should avoid assemblies with all sorts of bars and already installed updates - you never know. <br><br><h4>  Chromium </h4><br>  Here everything is the <a href="http://build.chromium.org/f/chromium/snapshots/chromium-rel-xp/76163/">same</a> , except for one ‚Äúbut‚Äù. <br><br>  A small lyrical digression, for those who are ‚Äúout of topic‚Äù: Chromium and Google Chrome are different browsers!  In fact, Google Chrome is a modification of Chromium, integrated with Google service and sending your data to the devil knows where.  In general, not our choice. <br><br>  Also, I am glad that Chromium does not need to install anything in the case of binary jumps.  Launched - and use.  Conveniently. <br><br>  Well, we installed, turned on VPN, everything seems to be good, traffic is encrypted, requests come from other countries, and so on.  But can intruders or a bloody gebnya still find out something?  Full <br><br>  For a start, learn not to leave traces behind you.  It is unlikely for someone to be a secret that in many browsers there is a so-called ‚Äúporno mode‚Äù. <br><br>  In Firefox, it is turned on with the key combination Ctrl + Shift + P, or in the Tools menu.  In Chromium, you need to create a new window in incognito mode through the main menu, or by pressing Ctrl + Shift + N. <br>  When you are in this mode, the browser will not save logs, history, cookies and other "tasty" information.  Already good, isn't it? <br><br>  For complete happiness, there remain a few strokes to the portrait, namely, learn how to block the execution of "left-handed scripts", Java applets, Flash and other potentially dangerous components that threaten anonymity.  Yes, and critical vulnerabilities there often come across, so the best solution would be to block them, with minor exceptions, of course, at your own risk and peril. <br><br><h5>  Mozilla firefox </h5><br>  For Firefox, there is <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/ru/firefox/addon/noscript/">NoScript</a> - one of the most popular extensions that does an excellent job with its task.  I would like to note that those who are afraid of Google, can clean out the so-called.  "White list" in the settings, since the google.com domain is there by default.  In general, the description speaks for itself, you can run to install. <br><br>  <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/ru/firefox/addon/betterprivacy/">BetterPrivacy</a> will provide protection against so-called.  ‚ÄúSupercookie‚Äù, which are installed using Flash or stored in ‚ÄúDOM Storage‚Äù. <br><br>  <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/ru/firefox/addon/browserprotect/">BrowserProtect</a> prohibits third-party programs to make changes to your browser. <br><br>  <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/ru/firefox/addon/user-agent-switcher/">User Agent Switcher</a> allows you to change and hide the user agent on the fly - the name, engine, version, installed plugins and other information about your browser, which is transmitted to the site. <br><br>  <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/ru/firefox/addon/lastpass-password-manager">LastPass Password Manager</a> is a more convenient password manager that supports authorization using ajax, as well as safely storing them. <br><br><h4>  Chromium </h4><br>  With Chromium, the situation in this regard is a bit more complicated.  So far, there is no more or less intelligible alternative to NoScript, but you can install several separate plug-ins that are responsible for blocking certain types of content, as well as pick up all unnecessary and dangerous in the Settings menu, the Advanced tab, the Content Settings button . <br><br>  Also, there is a plug-in <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/odjhifogjcknibkahlpidmdajjpkkcfn">NotScript</a> , I think what it does, no need to explain. <br><br><h3>  Conclusion </h3><br>  In conclusion, I would like to note that if you need a portable ready-made solution and you have access to a VPN service, you should take a closer look at Operator YAPO.  If you are paranoid and afraid to fall prey to the author of this build (the source code is closed, as well as Opera itself), you can simply install the necessary plugins and follow certain rules, but in the case of Firefox and some other browsers you will have to sacrifice portability.  Although, again, you can find a suitable portable assembly of your favorite browser, but not everyone will have the source code open. <br><br>  Which option to choose is up to you, as always. <br><br><h3>  Our news </h3><br>  Time <a href="https://kebrum.com/">passes</a> , we are <a href="https://kebrum.com/">prettier</a> . <br><br>  Firstly, we added support for IPsec / L2TP (it turned out that too many operators block GRE traffic).  More options are always good. <br><br>  Secondly, PPTP and IPsec / L2TP have become available in America, England and Holland.  This will please iPad lovers who can watch foreign TV shows lying on the couch.  As well as those who can configure the router and watch the BBC directly from the TV (well, or download American exclusives on the X-Box). <br><br>  Thirdly, we have planned a transition from traffic to full unlimited on the twenties of this month.  Those who need quite a bit of traffic would be worth buying a minimum subscription for a year, since  price will increase.  Do not say later that I did not warn you. <br><br>  In general, for all this it is worth saying thanks to those who use our service.  We have the opportunity to do more and better.  By supporting us today you ensure a bright tomorrow. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/114767/">https://habr.com/ru/post/114767/</a></p>
