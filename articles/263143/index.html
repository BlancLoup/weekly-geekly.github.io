We were puzzled with this question when we started preparing our online program for the summer.  We share with you the resources that we especially remember. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h2>  Online programming </h2><br>  The most popular way to learn programming for children now is definitely block-visual language.  On the Internet there is an incredible variety of resources that are devoted to this topic.  There comes a boom of educational games on visual programming.  They are directed, first of all, to the preparation of the child to work with languages ‚Äã‚Äãand their syntax.  The child learns algorithms, cycles, sequences. <br><br>  Many people worry at what age to begin to engage with the child?  I think it is possible to give such games from the age of 5-6, but without fanaticism!  Up to 8 years old, a child develops thinking, an understanding of cause-effect relationships, logic, and imagination.  Programming classes can make an important contribution to the child's training system. <br><br>  A selection of various resources can be found here: <br><ul><li>  <a href="http://geektimes.ru/company/mailru/blog/252920/">How to grow an IT person</a> <br></li><li>  <a href="http://ain.ua/2015/06/26/588059">10 unusual games that teach programming and logic</a> </li></ul><br>  Almost all of them are free.

      There are different courses, not all of which take place in the summer period, but a selection from the ‚ÄúGreenhouses of social technologies‚Äù is: <a href="http://te-st.ru/2015/07/14/12-russian-online-schools-where-children-teach-programming/">12 online schools with instruction in Russian, where your children will be taught to program</a> <br><br>  The most successful on this background look: <br><br><h3>  Code.org ( <a href="http://www.code.org/">www.code.org</a> ) </h3><br>  The creators of the platform really tried and created an interesting resource for teaching programming.  Many games are already Russified, unlike other numerous resources.  Also, there are tasks for programming on paper.  By the way, it was they who in the past two years sent a whole wave around the world, organizing the ‚ÄúHour of the Code‚Äù. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/131/549/0e8/1315490e88bf45cfaed32a31f4ac2f17.jpg" alt="Hour code homepage"><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/b50/6ca/985/b506ca985398462da5385c005331f980.jpg" alt="Hour code: sample job"><br><br><h3>  Lightbot ( <a href="http://lightbot.com/">lightbot.com</a> ) </h3><br>  You can play both online and simply installing the game on the tablet.  By the way, in the latter case, an Internet connection is no longer required.  Why do we like her so much?  First, it is very clear and it has tasks that even an adult will think about.  Secondly, in the game you can easily master the procedures, algorithms and even recursion!  By the way, there are tasks for children from 4 years old. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/06f/0d4/ce7/06f0d4ce744542769bd5194bbaf51242.jpg" alt="Lightbot: sample job"><br><br><h3>  Scratch ( <a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/">scratch.mit.edu</a> ) </h3><br>  The most popular and successful option for teaching programming, after all, is programming on Scratch.  Unlike the games described earlier, where it is possible to program only as part of a task, everything can be done independently in Scratch.  Games, cartoons, animated pictures - all this develops the child‚Äôs imagination and thinking. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/2c7/251/c42/2c7251c42ef141c8bf9b81447d7d70d7.jpg" alt="Scratch home page"><br><br>  But it was a discovery for me that such a childlike, it would seem, system sometimes requires very little children's knowledge.  For example, in order to create a ping-pong game, you will need to know how to use complex branch operators. <br><br><iframe width="420" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/9TYA3XTpYGM%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700023,15700186,15700191,15700248,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhgDg_ewgv_KM7YttCg0m-wuZnd3MA" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br><h3>  Minecraft ( <a href="https://minecraft.net/">minecraft.net</a> ) </h3><br>  Children do not part with this game, teachers build their classes in the online environment and manage to teach children there not only in invention and programming, but even biology.  This is a resource with unlimited and overlooked features.  Gaming technology in action! <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/14d/d42/db6/14dd42db6bd84aedaec898c8a426df64.jpg" alt="Connectedcamps camp"><br><br>  According to these technologies, there are separate videos, courses and even an online camp, in which, pay attention, there is a <a href="http://connectedcamps.com/">referral for adults</a> . <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/6a5/1aa/387/6a51aa3878ec4fbd947bb5a37652c48a.jpg" alt="Camp Direction for Adults"><br><br>  I think it's not time to sign up and, finally, to understand how this world of Minecraft lives, because, I am ashamed to admit, for me it's just magic. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/761/991/8b6/7619918b66244c59b2920670c21959da.jpg"><br><br><h2>  Summer online schools and camps </h2><br>  Summer Camp Online is a new alternative to traditional offline camps. <br><br>  In this collection you can see interesting options for summer schools - <a href="http://www.edutainme.ru/post/summer-camp/">How to take a child in the summer</a> .  Some of them are free, some are paid - at the current exchange rate of the dollar is not entirely profitable, and, of course, in English. <br><br>  However, one of them really deserves special attention - Maker Camp. <br><br><h3>  Maker Camp ( <a href="http://makercamp.com/">makercamp.com</a> ) </h3><br>  It was organized by Make and Google.  This is an absolutely free camp, where every day a child is waiting for different tasks collected on the best resources of the Internet.  Most often they are really connected with work by hands and invention.  Less often - with programming.  All materials are open!  Every day new projects.  At the beginning of the video appeal from the leading (which I, frankly, always miss and turn to the study of today's projects). <br><br>  Just take it and do it - I wonder how it is not used?  The same thing happened when Google posted its study materials and detailed lesson plans for free on the Internet. <br><br>  The only time is all in English, but Google Translator will help you. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/95b/215/03f/95b21503ff2c40448444e68c67df6a1b.jpg" alt="Camp Maker Camp in English, inside view"><br><br><h3>  Edu Kraft Summer Online Camp ( <a href="http://www.edu-craft.ru/">www.edu-craft.ru</a> ) </h3><br>  In Russian, the first online robotics camp this year is organized by Edu Craft Center.  Their format differs from foreign ones in that the classes are taught by mentors in real time and the child can ask, clarify and ask for help at any moment of the lesson.  Also, in an online lesson, children can meet and see children from different parts of our country, expanding their understanding of the structure of the world and creating a network of useful contacts for developing future projects.  Moreover, the camp serves as a supplement to the summer days. <br><br>  For programming of robots in the online camp, innovative development of Russian developers is used - TRIK Studio.  Its capabilities include a simulation of the work of the robot in conditions close to real.  Thus, it gives the opportunity to evaluate the algorithms of the robot in different environments of stay and look at its behavior, reducing the time for software development and in some cases keeping the real robot safe and sound. <br><br>  The organizers did not bypass the question of invention (or maker, as it is now fashionable to call it) and included in the course the creation of models of robots from improvised "flexible" materials. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/66d/ee2/043/66dee2043ae342ca80cce46f7e2f1a3b.jpg" alt="The first online robotics camp Edu Craft"><br><br>  How would you spend geek holidays online? <br><br>  Catherine Dneprovskaya, <br>  CEO Edu Craft </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/263143/">https://habr.com/ru/post/263143/</a></p>
