  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Example of a (budget) Managed VPS: Under-VPS or Mega-VPS</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Recently, a lot has been written about such a convenient tool as VPS (VDS, ROOTDS and others like them), advantages and disadvantages compared to hosting and dedicated servers, but somehow, different companies tried to combine the best or at least fix sins three central paradigms of hosting organization - shared, virtual and dedicated.  Therefore, I would like to draw public attention to interesting hybrids, usually labeled Managed VPS. <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  The idea itself was born a long time ago - for a regular user, a VPS is good at reserving resources and a bad overhead monitor system.  Let's take the user root, give him a homemade panel and go.  In practice, the idea turned out to be so non-innovative, and the implementation was so incompetent that it was difficult for the user to distinguish such a proposal from a similar shared hosting, and it‚Äôs a pity to pay the multiple price for the mythical advantages, it‚Äôs worth adding that the VPS themselves didn‚Äôt have today's popularity and were more like a concern. <br><br>  The second attempt to hybridize VPS was the integration of client resources with the resources of the hosting company ‚Äî remote MySQL / Mail / etc subsystems, one-button software installation, additional boot modes, for example, in graphical mode with VNC and other tricks.  For ordinary users, this approach has had some success, but for people who know what they want from VPS, such options were not suitable either for flexibility or ideology.  The approach is exactly the opposite, sharpening the VPS for a specific task, has received distribution, but as far as I know, I haven‚Äôt found a total love of users

      It all came down to the fact that the Managed VPS was taken from the user‚Äôs root, gave him a (not) convenient panel, set up an automatic backup and monitoring of the system and asked him to pay extra.  And then the era of cloud computing somehow began and vertical scaling suddenly became important for everyone, the idea itself was far from being so new that struck people's minds that they forgot about everything else and the custom part of the VPS technology practically did not develop, although there were more than enough unsolved problems.  But from the cradle for VPS some interesting observations were made - so suddenly they noticed that VPS had a big problem with disk operations and their scaling, resources don‚Äôt want to be backed up, the swap is very strange, especially if it is shared, VPS turned out to be overkill unskilled users in administration.  Somewhere around this time, modern managed VPSs began to appear, an example of which I would like to cite below, it will be a hybrid of managed shared hosting and managed VPS from DreamHost <br><br>  It must be said that at that time it seemed short-sighted to exchange the root for the installed Apache, a muddy socket and backups, and always relying on dedicated servers, I just happened to be a client of DreamHost, not offering VPS yet, but with very bright tariffs.  Without thinking and talking with a support, I was the owner of 1Tb space and 10Tb traffic for $ 6.95 per month, I think it‚Äôs not necessary to say that using these resources in your own config is almost impossible.  Then only just announced VPS for clients and having agreed with admins I became one of the first users of this branch. <br><br>  1. Price <br>  10 MB of memory cost $ 1 and 10MHz of power was previously allocated to them.  I took a minimum - 150 Mb RAM for 15 USD.  For a normal and even managed VPS, this price is too high, but here DH has its advantages, which I wanted to brazenly exploit <br><br>  2. Features justifying the price or compensating for the absence of the root <br>  - The disk subsystem is organized through the SAN, it turns out very quickly and reliably, the "neighboring" VPS practically do not affect the disk operations.  This approach allows you to implement almost unlimited accounts, I personally kept 5 Mio small files with a total size of 200-300 GB without complaints, even active work with disks of visible brakes did not give <br>  - Traffic for VPS (not passing through their Apache) is not charged.  The administration <b>asks</b> not to use more than 50mbit / s channel around the clock, I have successfully used 40-50mbit / s for quite a modest total package price of about $ 22 <br>  - The support service is fast and competent, I hung online for a couple of hours with their admins, who put me 3-4 different reverse proxy until I was satisfied <br>  - Dedicated MySQL server, no need to waste VPS resources on database maintenance <br>  - Ability to increase VPS resources in real time up to 4Gb RAM / 4GHz CPU, per minute billing, i.e.  for the time of resource-intensive operations or peak hours, you can buy more resources.  Burst is available for free for an additional 150-450 MB <br><br>  3. Organization as a whole <br>  All standard operations can be performed from the proprietary hoster panel.  The hoster provides all the necessary tools for developers.  By default on VPS there is Apache2, php is supported by both mod_php and fcgi, XCache, any number of domains with individual settings.  For those in need there is a pearl, a python, a rubirelsa, for those who like to be distorted by CGI and SSI, and for developers (apparently at the request of workers) CVS and SVN.  Soap servers as well as DB, DNS rendered.  Debuggers for PHP are enabled through the caliper.  I personally stuck nginx and asked the support to arrange the 80th port for me, without root here, unfortunately, in no way.  For lovers of more complex configurations, you can collect your software with your hands and just kick a support for assigning priority ports to it <br><br>  4. Of the useful services, I noticed WebDAV (unfortunately, the implementation does not allow using the files downloaded in this way from the VPS, all through workraounds), streaming server, Jabber server.  A three-month refund period if not satisfied with the service. <br><br>  The second interesting hybrid is Mosso, the predecessor of SliceHost.  These guys, by the way, also came from RackSpace, went the other way - they clustered everything they could.  Until recently, they provided it in the form of shared hosting, but now they promise to release a product based on the VPS model.  Unfortunately, there is very little information here, but considering the common roots with SliceHost, the product will soon be available to the masses, let me remind you that their main product was highlighted using SAN, transparent clustering of a web server and databases, and was charged according to CPU cycles, for $ 100 a month - in cycles corresponding to Xeon 2.8 working a whole month at full speed.  Burst in this case is almost endless and stepless, that is, habraeffekt could lead to the use of 10-20 GHz at the peak, which in the short term peak will not even cost money <br><br>  Despite a certain price imbalance in the segment of managed hosting, in the end, the tariff turned out to be quite budget.  With a basic hosting price of $ 7 and a surcharge for VPS $ 15 plus a surcharge for increasing the resource when it is needed for less than $ 30, I received a fairly high-quality product from 1Tb of space and 10Tb of traffic, which was all that revolutionaries wanted so much.  By the way, in DreamHost you can distribute invites with a discount of $ 97, if anyone is interested in trying to strike, this discount should cover the setup and 1-2 months of free testing. <br><br>  The demo panel and in general more details about the beast can be viewed on the authors website. <br><br>  <b>Update:</b> for those who want to try to create the following invite codes with a discount of about $ 95: <br>  4HABR_YEAR - with a subscription for a year (119 USD) a discount of 97 USD is given, ie the base price of the hosting is removed almost <br>  4HABR_MONTH - monthly payment, $ 51 discount hitting the setup, additional domain for free, additional IP for free <br>  When you pay by <u>paper,</u> refund within 97 days </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/52591/">https://habr.com/ru/post/52591/</a></p>
