(The <a href="http://megamozg.ru/company/avoapp/blog/15026/">article can be read here.</a> ) But the project is developing, and we did not want to remain at the amateur level.  That is why it was decided to turn to professionals.  On the one hand, I wanted to get a really high-quality selling video.  On the other hand, it was very interesting to look at the creation process from the inside. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  We had a long-standing relationship with one of the studios (umbrela studio), so first of all we turned to them. <br><br>  Honestly, I was pleasantly surprised when I saw that everything was put on stream.  I expected endless meetings during which the ‚Äúcolor and pattern on the wings of a butterfly‚Äù, which should appear in the frame from 45 to 46 seconds, and the debate about which font to use or endless discourse on what music should be discussed. .

      In fact, everything turned out to be much simpler.  After 15 minutes of conversation with a nice girl on Skype, we painted a brief: <br><ul><li>  Roller Object is a mobile application that allows you to save on roaming.  The user can receive and make calls to his number, even if he prefers to use a local SIM card on trips </li><li>  targeting - business travelers or frequent travelers who need to stay in touch with their number. </li><li>  concept - to present the application and the advantages of its use, ease of use, low cost, saving up to 90% on roaming. </li><li>  call-to-action - you just don't have to try anything.  Install now. </li><li>  Languages ‚Äã‚Äã- English, Russian. </li></ul><br>  Less than a day later, I received a script in English.  During the day, several edits were made and the final version was adopted.  Then there was the Russian translation, in which I wanted to make a few small changes.  In fact, it was the text that the announcer voiced.  The script did not contain storyboards, scene descriptions and all that.  But this is even better, because it would be too difficult for perception and could entail a longer process of discussion. <br><br>  A couple of days later I received a storyboard in the mail.  This is something like a comic strip, showing the main scenes of the movie.  Usually they do not show a storyboard to customers, as they say ‚Äúthey don‚Äôt show half the works‚Äù, but I insisted.  :) <br><br>  It looked like this: <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img width="90%" src="https://habrastorage.org/files/795/32a/853/79532a85380a49ee982a5ff6d1f8f7bf.jpeg"></div><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img width="90%" src="https://habrastorage.org/files/43b/d39/4d7/43bd394d72024290b6f702073adeb4d2.jpeg"></div><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img width="90%" src="https://habrastorage.org/files/853/71b/0ef/85371b0efb4a480db1a46d83ecceaff3.jpeg"></div><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img width="90%" src="https://habrastorage.org/files/a96/295/b15/a96295b1537441c38ce572fa963d9d69.jpeg"></div><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img width="90%" src="https://habrastorage.org/files/002/3ea/ef7/0023eaef7c814418844665f3de51949b.jpeg"></div><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img width="90%" src="https://habrastorage.org/files/fa0/902/a38/fa0902a38044415692245aaa5ac433b0.jpeg"></div><br><br>  Of course, I needed to justify my obstinacy with something, so I asked them to make a few minor changes.  I didn‚Äôt like the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãdescending from the sky Dutch women with the AVO logo, probably atheism played in me. <br><br>  After making the appropriate amendments, work began on the graphics, which, to my surprise, lasted only a couple of days. <br><br>  At this stage, no changes were made and the guys started the animation and voice acting. <br><br>  I would like to note that initially the requirement was made that the duration of the video should be no more than 30 seconds.  But after we looked at the first option, it became clear that this was a brute force, the speed at which information was presented was too high, and the viewer could hardly process it.  Therefore, it was decided to slow down and lengthen the video for another 10 seconds.  After re-voicing and adjusting the video for a new speed, we got the final version: <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/VvJM50r5Rjo%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700022,15700186,15700190,15700248,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhgFo387zqzhRUcXcoY_l3SKBUdTbw" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  It would be nice to get your feedback on the video. <br><br>  <a href="http://www.avoapp.com/">www.avoapp.com</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/294078/">https://habr.com/ru/post/294078/</a></p>
