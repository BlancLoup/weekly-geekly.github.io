    <h1>  0. We formulate the problem </h1><br><br>  I do not know how it is with others, but my formulation of an idea begins with the formulation of a problem.  Where there is a problem, she may have a solution for which you can ask for money.  Examples of that million, you know. <br><br>  In my case, and specifically in my city, there is one problem.  Every quarter, individual entrepreneurs and organizations need to submit reports.  There is only one tax inspection in my city; it serves not only my city, but also several nearby cities.  It is clear that in this situation huge queues accumulate in the inspection deadlines. <br><br><blockquote>  Of course, reporting can be submitted by mail, as well as electronically.  We'll talk about the electronic view, but the mail works even worse, since the local telephone operator now accepts payments only through mail, there the queues just never stop. </blockquote><br><br>  Of course, what remains is another fairly simple way to submit reports - in electronic form.  But there are some problems here too.  First, you need to connect (read - fill out a bunch of forms, install the program) and learn how to use it, as well as to think about reporting forms and electronic uploads.  Not everyone is capable of this, so they are standing in line. <br><br><h1>  1. Problem solving </h1><br>  And it lies on the surface.  Our specialized telecom operator delivers a solution called ‚ÄúTax Representative‚Äù.  In this case, any taxpayer can contact a representative and submit reports.  The representative pays for 1 report 70 rubles and takes from the client as much as he sees fit.  Simply, right?  At the same time, the client does not need to fill in anything, it does not need to go anywhere.  It only requires a report. <br><br><h1>  2. Strokes </h1><br><br><h2>  2.1.  Technical part </h2><br>  So, if we buy the software "Tax Representative", we will be able to submit reports.  What is worth?  Only 1200 rubles for the connection.  Payment order, two days of waiting, one form in electronic form and ... welcome to the club. <br><br><h2>  2.2.  Location </h2><br>  Of course, even becoming a representative, it will be quite difficult to persuade a client not to go to the tax office, because the stereotypical thinking is strong enough.  This means that you need to be located in the tax office.  Hm <br><br>  We make an appointment with the head of the inspection and offer him the reception of electronic reporting right in the hall, next to the windows for delivery. <br><br><blockquote>  And here it should be noted that the tax inspectorate itself is sufficiently interested in taxpayers switching to electronic reporting, since every year they are required to fulfill a certain plan of ‚Äúelectronicization‚Äù, but people are not in a hurry. </blockquote><br><br>  The head of the tax inspectorate understands that such a step would allow the weakly popularized system of electronic submission of reports.  Therefore, he agrees.  Hooray! <br><br><h2>  2.3.  Again the technical part </h2><br>  Of course, as soon as we decided to sit in the lobby of the tax inspectorate, we doomed ourselves to one small problem - communication.  No one will under any circumstances give a third-party organization at least in any form to connect to the network in the inspection, and what can we say about access to the holy of holies - the EDI system.  Well, okay! <br><br>  Since we need the Internet to communicate with the service provider, for the time being we will decide to use EDGE, that is, a mobile phone.  Traffic, it should be noted, is quite small, 2-3 kilobytes per 1 declaration. <br><br>  It is clear that you need a laptop, and along with the printer.  Um  Everything seems to be in any small company, like mine. <br><br><h1>  3. We form the business process </h1><br><h2>  3.1.  How will it look like? </h2><br>  So, now it is time to formulate what the chain of services will look like and think what else might be needed. <br><br>  Taxpayer is coming.  He has a paper declaration (absolutely precisely) and, if he is disciplined, then a declaration on a diskette (yes, for a tax one, only a diskette).  However, especially not to hope for a floppy disk.  He gives either a paper declaration that is ‚Äústuffed‚Äù or a floppy disk, reports are sent, the taxpayer gives money, receives a receipt, and also a piece of paper with confirmation of dispatch. <br><br>  What we need: <br><ul><li>  ideally, a power of attorney issued to a representative (ie, to us) so that we can report.  However, the tax inspectorate helped and allowed to certify the sender independently, without a power of attorney. <br>  cash register for violating cash discipline in tax - awesome insolence :) <br>  the printer, of course, and the A5 leaflets, in order to immediately print a cash order, without cutting it out of A4 paper. <br>  drive, because it was not in the laptop.  800 rubles and 1 day of waiting. <br>  contract with a telecom operator to account for traffic expenses as a firm‚Äôs expenses. <br>  a laptop of course. <br>  mobile phone with EDGE support (yes, speed is good). <br>  advertising leaflets, which we will attach a stapler to each receipt. <br>  1C: Enterprise "Taxpayer", version 7.7 or 8.1, which one is more like.  We already had 7.7, 8.1 costs only 1500 rubles.  It will allow you to fill out declarations and upload them electronically. <br>  clerical trifle. <br><br><br><h2>  3.2.  Pricing </h2><br>  It is clear that the cost of one declaration is 70 rubles.  Below this level you should not fall.  Now we think about what price to put for the end user.  100 rubles will be small, for 30 rubles from above will give money only on a very large amount.  And we still have only 1 laptop. <br>  Then the figure of 150 rubles comes up.  Already better.  80 rubles - just justify those 10 minutes that they leave to ‚Äúslaughter‚Äù one declaration and leave ‚Äúto ice cream‚Äù. <br><br><h1>  4. Start! </h1><br>  Well, everything is prepared, packed in bags.  15 numbers - start. <br><br>  And immediately, the first results: <br><ul><li>  the price is chosen correctly in order to save a whole day of standing in line 150 rubles - not money. <br>  with the communication channel lohanus.  Slowly, that Beeline, that Megaphone.  MTS does not work with the operator‚Äôs server at all.  Skylink comes to the rescue.  Additional costs for modem and contract are covered for 1 day of work;) <br>  A5 leaflets - rulez.  Very quickly I manage to make documents. <br>  The small cash desk, which was bought at the time for the enterprise, is super, and at the same time it also takes a long time to work from the battery. <br>  It‚Äôs not convenient for one person to sit with a hand, not to go anywhere, but together it‚Äôs very convenient, one dictates a declaration, the other ‚Äúslaughters‚Äù it. <br><br><br>  As usual, for details - in the comments;) And yes, anticipating the questions, I will say that everything was successful and is still going well. <br><br>  With love, <br>  <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/users/maniaque/" class="user_link">maniaque</a> </li></ul></li></ul></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/29726/">https://habr.com/ru/post/29726/</a></p>
