Monge was born in Bon C√¥te d'0r.  Brilliantly graduated from the School of Military Engineers in Mezieres, from 1768.  became a professor of mathematics, and since 1771.  - also a professor of physics at this school.  Since 1780  taught hydraulics at the Louvre School (Paris).  Engaged in mathematical analysis, chemistry, meteorology, practical mechanics.  In the period of the French bourgeois revolution, he worked in the commission to establish a new system of weights and measures, then he was the naval minister and organizer of the national defense of France.  During the Directory, he became close to Napoleon Bonaparte, took part in his campaign to Egypt and founded the Egyptian Institute in Cairo (1798);  was elevated to the rank of count.  Gaspar Monge received worldwide recognition, creating in the 70s of the XVIII century.  modern projection drawing methods and its basis - descriptive geometry.  The same name was received and the main work of Monge on these issues, published in 1799. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/c62/7bc/0b8/c627bc0b83798a46d8d5d158e56d93c1.jpg"><br>  <i>Fig.</i>  <i>1 Exposition dedicated to Gaspard Monge at Paris Polytechnic School</i> <br><br>  The creation of the treatise ‚ÄúDescriptive Geometry‚Äù (‚ÄúGeometrie descriptive‚Äù) served as the beginning and the basis of the works that allowed the new Europe to master the geometric knowledge of ancient Greece. <br><br>  In accordance with the method proposed by Gaspard Mongem (by the method of orthogonal projection), two mutually perpendicular projection planes are considered in space.  One of the planes of the projections <i>P <sub>1</sub> is located horizontally</i> (the horizontal plane of the projections), and the second <i>P <sub>2</sub> is vertical</i> (the frontal plane of the projections).  <b>The planes are endless and opaque.</b> <br><br>  The planes of the projections divide space into four dihedral angles ‚Äî quarters.  When considering orthogonal projections, it is assumed that the observer is in the first quarter at an infinitely large distance from them.  If complete information on the distance of a point relative to the plane of projections is presented not by using numerical marks, but by using the second projection of a point built on the second plane of projections, then such a drawing is called two-image or complex. <br><br>  The line of intersection of the planes of the projections is called the coordinate axis and is denoted by x <sub>12</sub> . <br><br>  Since these planes are opaque, only those geometric objects that are located within the first quarter will be visible to the observer. <br><br>  To get a flat drawing consisting of the specified projections, the plane P <sub>1 is</sub> combined by rotating around the x axis <sub>12</sub> with the plane P <sub>2</sub> (Fig. 2).  A projection drawing, in which the projection planes with everything that is depicted on them, combined in a certain way with each other, is called the <b>Monge diagram</b> (from French Epure, the drawing (Fig. 3) or the complex drawing. <br><br>  Geometric drawing objects are divided into: linear (point, straight, plane), non-linear (curved line, surface) and composite (polyhedrons, one-dimensional and two-dimensional lines). <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/543/975/8c9/5439758c90e7339cf5ba400a0fe555eb.gif"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/43c/39f/f49/43c39ff4992a140c0187d6648db7f4ac.gif" align="right"><br><br><pre>  Fig.  2 System of three projection planes Fig.3 Drawing (diagram)     
</pre><br><br>  So, gradually accumulated and scattered among themselves, the rules and methods of imaging were brought to the system by the scientist and developed in his classic work.  Since the publication of his <b>‚ÄúDescriptive geometry‚Äù</b> in France by Gaspard Monge, more than two hundred years have passed.  Since then, as a discipline and as a separate science, brought to life by the genius Monge, due to the urgent need to improve engineering technology, she began to spread from France to other countries with incredible speed.  Nowadays, ‚ÄúDescriptive Geometry‚Äù has taken its rightful place among the other fundamental disciplines of the higher technical school as the main academic discipline, without the knowledge of which a complete engineering education is unthinkable. <br><br>  Monge's work, originally printed as a study guide, has <i>not lost its significance to the present day and constitutes the main part of the training course on imaging techniques</i> .  It showed the general character of the versatile activity of the great French scientist: his deep research mind, which promoted science, and tireless energy, aimed at applying theoretical calculations to the practice of engineering. <br><br>  The name <b>Gaspar Monge</b> , immortalized on the Eiffel Tower, confirms this. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/217769/">https://habr.com/ru/post/217769/</a></p>
