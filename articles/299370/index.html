  <section class="page js-page"><h1>What IT specialists are currently in demand in Germany, the Netherlands and Malta (part 2)</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  More than a month has passed since the publication of the <a href="https://megamozg.ru/company/itroles/blog/23820/">first part</a> of the demand review for IT specialists in Germany. <br><br>  <b>What's new:</b> <br><ul><li>  Added countries: the Netherlands and Malta. </li><li>  Companies start using ItRabota services (without intermediaries). </li></ul><br>  <b>Demand by country:</b> <br><ul><li>  Germany: </li><li>  <b>Senior / Middle: PHP, JavaScript, Java, NodeJs, iOS / Andorid, .NET, as well as QA and devOps</b> </li><li>  Netherlands: </li><li>  <b>Senior: PHP, JavaScript, Java, NodeJs</b> </li><li>  Malta: </li><li>  <b>Senior / Middle: PHP, JavaScript</b> </li></ul><br>  Malta will be especially interesting to all who love a lot of sun and sea.  Another very important feature of this small island is a sense of security.  I am just starting with Malta, and everything will depend on the interest of specialists in this country. <br><br>  Working directly with companies has a very important advantage - companies are much better than agents know what kind of specialists they are looking for.  In addition, agents do not accept candidates who work at the same workplace for less than 2 years.  Of course, this may alert the company, but the fact that in the case of working with a project the company will not lay out a full amount for a candidate will substantially smooth out this shortcoming. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  <b>Jobs from a specific company from Germany:</b> <br>  <b>Front-end (AngularJS), Java, SysOps / DevOps, QA and Support Engineers.</b>  The company's activities are strongly tied to databases and everything connected with it.  The level of candidates from the middle and above.  Also, some vacancies include business trips to EU countries. <br>  So if databases, SQL, Vagrant, Docker, Ansible, Chef, Puppet sound familiar and if you can find solutions to complex problems, then welcome.

      There is also an unusual request for a UI / UX engineer for desktop applications (preferably, but not necessarily with WPF) <br><br>  One of the blog readers shared the opinion that system administrators can evolve into devOps.  If this is true, then it makes sense, because there is a demand for devOps. <br><br>  <b>Important points in working with <a href="http://itrabota.com/">itrabota.com</a></b> <br>  <b>1. Filling out the questionnaire and the skill matrix</b> <br>  - The title of the desired post should contain keywords, for example, not Programmer, but Senior Java developer. <br>  - The list of technologies should be exhaustive.  those.  it should consist of important technologies (you yourself know which technologies are important in your field).  For example, JSON, REST, API indicates there is no point, because for a web developer it goes without saying (for example, the web). <br><br>  <b>2. For now, you still need to upload resumes.</b> <br><br>  We can confidently say that specialists from the CIS are very appreciated.  I still think to expand to the EU countries, but it seems that the density of good specialists there will not be the same as from the post-Soviet countries.  Working abroad, you can transfer your experience and get a new one in return, then bring and implement it in your native country.  I like the corporate culture and organization of forkflow in foreign companies.  And even if it is also limping in something, still judging from my experience, foreign companies are much ahead in these matters. <br><br>  Resume wizard goes to the testing stage.  So far I will be testing among existing users of the project. <br><br>  Another idea is to make a referral system for successful candidates (those who got a job), as well as those who simply created a profile and are a real specialist in need of work, to make interesting gifts (for example from <a href="https://store.google.com/%3Fgl%3DUS">Google Store</a> ), instead of spending money on advertising.  If this arouses interest, then I implement it. <br><br>  I want the project to provide opportunities and help in matters for the solution of which the majority simply do not have enough time. <br><br>  The questionnaire can be created <a href="http://itrabota.com/">here.</a> <br><br>  Like <a href="https://www.facebook.com/coolitrabota">facebook</a> group to keep abreast of all vacancies. <br><br>  Have a good day! </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/299370/">https://habr.com/ru/post/299370/</a></p>
