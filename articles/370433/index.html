      When developing Choc Creator 2.0 Plus, the creators took into account and eliminated all the disadvantages of the previous version 1.0, improved the design, usability and printing technology.  And indeed, Chocolate Creator 2.0 impresses with its ease of use, compactness, performance, and almost limitless possibilities in working with chocolate. <br><br>  <b>Design</b> <br><br>  The laconic and stylish design of the Choc Creator 2.0 Plus, a compact body and low weight leaves a pleasant impression.  The body of the printer is made of durable aluminum frame, printed platform made of stainless steel, which indicates durability and reliability. <br><br>  Due to the small size (425x450x420 mm), the problem of finding a place to install a 3D printer is solved, it can easily fit in a small kitchen, bar counter, on any flat surface. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/864/0f5/981/8640f59814544e8ab71c0a4edab8d3fc.jpg"><br><br>  Another plus in the design is an open platform for printing, which allows you to observe the process of creating chocolate figures with interest.  Developers have significantly increased the size of the construction area to 18x18x5 cm, compared with previous models.  Now Choc Creator easily creates both miniature elements for decorating cakes, cookies, and large and voluminous chocolate products. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/765/0b3/ec5/7650b3ec575845c7a8de2c5dac7e5573.jpg"><br><br>  The printer is equipped with an LCD touch screen with a convenient 5-inch LCD display. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/f26/de7/e2a/f26de7e2a02e437e9b0deef93147bf4f.jpg"><br><br>  <b>Equipment</b> <br><br>  When you open the box with Choc Creator 2.0 Plus, you involuntarily attend the pleasant feeling of caring for your customers.  The printer is already in the most collected state, no need to spend time reading extra instructions and the actual assembly itself.  In a small transparent suitcase there are all the necessary accessories for work.  A few words about the main ones: <br><br><ul><li>  Syringe for chocolate from stainless steel of 30 ml. </li><li>  ( <i>If necessary, you can separately order additional syringes. This is very convenient if you are going to work with several colors of chocolate or want to increase the speed of the workflow</i> ) </li></ul><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/081/9c9/961/0819c9961f56475484d39e0c283abbd6.jpg"><br><br><ul><li>  2 Nozzles with a diameter of 0.8 mm, to which a special cleaning needle is attached. </li><li>  Magnets for fixing paper.  Plain baking paper can be placed on the printing platform. </li><li>  5 boot heads. </li></ul><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/43b/4b1/388/43b4b1388b9d4572a4df5bcd765f333a.jpg"><br><br><ul><li>  8 Gb USB flash drive in a stylish gold design. </li><li>  Height calibration disk and hexagon for adjusting the platform. </li></ul><br>  Among other things, the printer comes with useful extras: a syringe brush, a touchscreen stylus, a container for chocolate, and so on. <br><br>  <b>Material for printing</b> <br><br>  For Choc Creator 2.0 Plus, only high-quality chocolate raw materials without additives and fillers are suitable.  The manufacturer strongly recommends the use of Belgian chocolate Barry Callebaut No. 811 with a cocoa content of 54.5%.  When tempering chocolate Callebaut, it turns out the structure, which allows to achieve maximum accuracy in modeling. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/747/583/860/747583860fd5446e926cd14c88fb6cb6.jpg"><br><br>  We experimented with printing with Barry Callebaut colored milk chocolate.  Our verdict - due to a different melting point, it is very problematic to print 3D models of milk chocolate, the figures quickly begin to melt.  But if you put such chocolate on a dark chocolate base, you get an excellent result and the products keep their shape.  You can also make the decor colored chocolate with a syringe, which comes in a set of chocolate 3D-printer. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/b40/a12/4d0/b40a124d0a6646ce9f9b8693cd9110b8.jpg"><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/7fc/657/2c8/7fc6572c85384432a1a80535e4fc63e8.jpg"><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/ae3/6fe/5e2/ae36fe5e2b1a4fa19737a6a04ae20d17.jpg"><br><br>  <b>Modeling capabilities</b> <br><br>  ‚ÄúChocolate Creator‚Äù is ready to realize all the most bold ideas of the pastry chef with 2D, 2.5D and 3D printing. <br><br>  <b>2D printing</b> allows you to create any bas-relief art image made of chocolate, be it a logo, a portrait, an inscription, a pattern, or any other object.  This printing method is ideal for decorating cakes, cookies, gingerbread, or decorating desserts in a restaurant. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/e8c/1d8/e1a/e8c1d8e1a00743de8f7021dfb1ed018b.jpg"><br><br>  The pastry cheater will save time and also perform work that is difficult or impossible to do manually.  The approximate printing speed of the 1st product is from 3 to 8 minutes. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/53a/efd/f50/53aefdf504d84cd690676770b9a75e0b.jpg"><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/d4a/8df/8b8/d4a8df8b8e694b62ae07972de5db0b31.jpg"><br><br>  <b>2,5D-models</b> create a huge field for culinary creativity.  2,5D-products are not as fragile as 2D, therefore, in addition to decorating, they can be used as an independent chocolate product.  In the area of ‚Äã‚Äãsweet business souvenirs, Choc Creator 2.0 Plus has no equal, thanks to the possibility of identical repeated repetition of any model.  The approximate printing speed of the 1st product is from 3 to 15 minutes. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/44c/214/9b3/44c2149b350a48a896806d6c5300304f.jpg"><br><br>  <b>3D</b> is the most unique and amazing way to print chocolate. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/101/e4e/efc/101e4eefc37243c4aa2f737b838c576d.jpg"><br><br>  You can print a finished 3D model, embody a scanned 3D object and recreate a mini-copy of almost any object.  Printed 3D-models can not be copied manually, this is the case when the machine is superior to humans.  A great option for creating copyright chocolate products, candy, sweet souvenirs and gifts.  The approximate printing speed of the 1st product is from 20 to 40 minutes. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/6a3/d2a/d62/6a3d2ad623ed486f89467e23c1066969.jpg"><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/d77/5ae/892/d775ae8920a04bf0a7bf339085ae8650.jpg"><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/325/8c6/c20/3258c6c20e5f4178aee012f0165a18bd.jpg"><br><br>  <b>Printing software</b> <br><br>  A library of ready-to-print models has already been loaded into the 3D printer software.  Also, especially for Choc Creator 2.0 Plus, simple web applications were developed that are ideal for beginners: <br><br>  <b>Mix &amp; Match</b> : a database of templates that can be printed in finished form, or add your own labels and elements. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/13b/e55/69b/13be5569bb2945c3ad8d73a94f8ae94f.jpg"><br><br>  <b>ChocoText</b> : converter of any text with or without a substrate to the STL format for further printing (the only negative is that at the moment texts can be created only in English). <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/889/edd/caa/889eddcaa41a457b8dc673f25e488ba2.jpg"><br><br>  <b>Choc Draw</b> is a mobile graphic application for Android that allows you to create your own drawings, which are sent to print with a flick of the wrist.  Quite an interesting and creative way to create models that even a child can use. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/281/a88/2fe/281a882fecde46688ce85f1318dfa532.jpg"><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/18a/bec/45c/18abec45c0cc4065a6042ca49a383ae3.jpg"><br><br>  In addition, Choc Creator 2.0 Plus 3D Printer supports any software for working with 3D graphics (Autodesk, Tinkercad, Google SketchUp, etc.).  This fact is important when creating your own copyright 3D-models. <br><br>  Loading models for printing in the printer via USB-port or Wi-Fi, no extra wires are required. <br><br>  <b>Work with printer</b> <br><br>  Choc Creator 2.0 Plus is very easy to manage, the following briefly describes the main steps in the process of preparing the printer and the printing itself. <br><br><ul><li>  3D-printer must be installed on a flat surface, turn on. </li><li>  The syringe tank is filled with tempered chocolate. </li></ul><br>  <i>Important!</i>  <i>When filling the syringe, it is unacceptable for air bubbles to get out of the chocolate, otherwise the model layer may be lost during printing.</i>  <i>If you hear a distinctive sound when sucking chocolate with a syringe, it is best to remove the chocolate from the syringe and repeat the dressing process from the beginning.</i> <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/1d3/a7d/9a1/1d3a7d9a1383409883862f0a67fab857.jpg"><br><br><ul><li>  The filled syringe is inserted into the printer compartment, secured in a special slot and the stem is adjusted.  In the syringe, after being placed in the printer, the selected temperature regime of the chocolate is constantly maintained. </li></ul><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/a8b/30b/b4b/a8b30bb4bd4147a5a768e94c1ab2da9c.jpg"><br><ul><li>  Next, adjust the distance from the nozzle to the printing platform, which allows you to print on a plate or cookie. </li></ul><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/b1a/482/e33/b1a482e33a844802bbae93dd5b6d3e5b.jpg"><br><ul><li>  On the display, select the temperature mode, the selected model, print size and press the "Start" button. </li></ul><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/bcd/6e8/dc9/bcd6e8dc98dc4f09a7e632a803f06cf1.jpg"><br><br>  <i><b>The process of tempering chocolate</b> should be carried out in a certain temperature regime.</i> <i><br><br></i>  <i>At the beginning, dark chocolate is melted at a temperature of 50 degrees, then cooled to about 27 degrees and then heated to 30-31 degrees (slightly different temperature conditions are observed for white and milk chocolate).</i>  <i>Tempering can be done at home using a microwave or water bath, but you should have a thermometer on hand to measure the temperature.</i>  <i>Proper tempering will give chocolate figures a hardness and shine after cooling.</i> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/db5/994/908/db5994908f554577991e54f2419eb8db.jpg"><br><br>  To achieve good results when printing, do not forget about the temperature conditions for the printer itself.  In the room in which printing takes place, the air temperature should not exceed 22 degrees; ideally, print at 19 degrees - this is the optimum temperature for working with chocolate. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/a09/cf0/3a5/a09cf03a5df144ef83377df94c557dc1.jpg"><br><br>  <b>Total:</b> <br><br>  We can say that the Choc Creator 2.0 Plus 3D printer is a kind of innovative breakthrough in the world of 3D food technology.  He impresses at first sight with his visual and technical characteristics.  Special thanks to the developers for the incredibly convenient and accessible to everyone interface. <br><br>  We presented Choc Creator at CONDE NAST Digital Day events and at the Palm Branch-2017 festival of restaurant concepts, 3D-chocolate maker won the hearts of HoReCa representatives with print quality, performance and diverse use cases. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/640/f9c/4fe/640f9c4fe7d14e5593c398fbb9af444a.jpg"><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/7f6/f73/99a/7f6f7399a4894b80b9ccc4ec09d69acd.jpg"><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/f44/ada/bce/f44adabcef2548218f9f71b9126139a8.jpg"><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/dcf/5d5/a2e/dcf5d5a2e86242b49df09cd09d88ffc9.jpg"><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/54d/2af/dd0/54d2afdd0c814bca9f785faa35846464.jpg"><br><br>  The chocolate 3D printer has attracted great interest among representatives of event-agencies, including among organizers of master classes and children's events.  This is explained by the fact that in our time it is very difficult to surprise a customer.
