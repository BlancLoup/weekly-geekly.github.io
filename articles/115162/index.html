  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Paradox search web designer in the region</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Good afternoon friends!  We decided to talk about our experience in selecting web designers and a number of frank paradoxes that we occasionally encounter. <br>  <i>‚ÄúIs it difficult to find a designer?</i>  <i>Yes, today there are more people on the web than anywhere else, and web design is especially in fashion!</i>  <i>Thousands of designers, including freelancers, just choose the best! ‚Äù</i> So many say, but as soon as the company goes to a specific search for an employee, an amazing start begins. <br>  We announce a vacancy on all portals, in which we list the requirements for the designer, we emphasize that MST works with the largest customers, we remind about the increased quality requirements.  And on the same day they <i>begin to come They</i> are a portfolio! <br>  In the first archive we sent we found ... a single button for the site.  MST really hoped that this tiny button did not become ‚Äúthe work of his life‚Äù for the author, but the minimalist creator no longer appeared and did not send any new buttons.  We realized that we had witnessed a creative crisis: it really was the button of his whole life. <a name="habracut"></a>  The work of digital agency requires a very large number of buttons - not to mention the whole concepts of sites, so we waited for more active applicants. <br><br>  The next candidate sent us a portrait of an alien.  At first glance, the character successfully pretended to be a woman of Homo Sapiens, but her ears were given out: her ears were located a little above the line of the mouth, which, you see, is not normal for people.  So we recognized the stranger, perhaps unfriendly, but did not take the team, because the representative of an extraterrestrial civilization did not show its membership in the field of web design. <br><br>  The web designer's vacancy unexpectedly opened an MST gateway for all sorts of photoshop.  As it is known, commercial photoshopery is most in demand in the wedding industry, so every day our mail was attacked by wedding cakes and brides, painted on balloons.  But the authors of the collages, members of the secret art group "Cake", also did not explain how they were going to use their talents in web design.

        <ins class="adsbygoogle"
          style="display:block; text-align:center;"
          data-ad-layout="in-article"
          data-ad-format="fluid"
          data-ad-client="ca-pub-6974184241884155"
          data-ad-slot="8945601208"></ins>

      <br>
      On the other hand, the candidates ‚Äôown electronic projects‚Äô did not provide confidence that they could draw concepts for the largest companies.  We were especially frightened by the 3d-project of an amusement park made of eerie reinforcement structures with blurred edges;  Looking at the figures of visitors to the park, we wondered why there was no horror on their faces - this would immediately increase the karma of the project. <br>  Every web developer has something to add to the list, so it makes no sense to list all the design examples that we periodically receive from candidates. <br><br>  Designers from the MST team explain the problem by the insufficient level of self-criticism of candidates: <br>  - Even if a person, for example, painted a couple of days in Photoshop - he already considers himself a designer, hence, of course, incompetence and illiteracy, when any drawn button is ready to be included in the ‚Äúweb designer portfolio‚Äù. <br>  - Web design is a relatively young specialty, and it is rarely taught by real masters.  In most universities, in the process of learning, the student understands that he can do more than his teacher, and he ‚Äúcalms down‚Äù on this.  As a result, of course, the "school" level of the portfolio. <br><br>  The discussion on web design led us to a general conclusion: to succeed in web design, it is not enough to study the relevant specialty, and to fulfill a couple of regional orders is also not enough.  You need professional interest, you need to set goals for yourself and achieve them so that every project is cool, without any discounts.  And the specialist, whose works are assessed as cool and well paid, gets even more opportunities to improve their professionalism in a real good school, in particular, in the British Higher School of Design. <br><br>  We have identified an illogical pattern: when MST recruits designers to the Moscow branches of a company, candidates may be mediocre, may ask for an unreasonably large reward, but at least they really understand what web design is.  And all these glaring examples are a cross-section of regional talents that we get when we expand a regional staff.  <i>And regional candidates for web designers stubbornly consider their level of quality acceptable - why?</i> <br>  We strive to create the best working conditions for our designers, both technically and in terms of motivation, and we rejoice when a strong specialist joins the team.  But, as you can see, finding it is not easy.  So far we have decided to prepare a personnel reserve - we take interns, we conduct courses at the IT Training Center, looking for potential professionals. <br><br>  How would you answer the question of how to find good web designers in the regions?  Or does a web developer can only forge valuable frames on his own? </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/115162/">https://habr.com/ru/post/115162/</a></p>
