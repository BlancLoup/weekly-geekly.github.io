Having a particular passion for this topic, we at <a href="http://madrobots.ru/">Madrobots.ru</a> decided to make a selection of the 15 most popular IoT gadgets presented to the public last year.  Unfortunately, some of the heroes of our review have not yet come into mass production.  But the status of "folk products" received everything.  In our opinion, this circumstance gives them the right to go down in history - at least in the history of the Internet of things. <br><br>  1. <b><a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/roost/the-roost-smart-battery-smarten-your-smoke-alarms">Roost</a> : ‚Äúsmart battery‚Äù for fire alarms</b>

    <img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/39d/048/730/39d048730e67475ca835b6d34d5f1f36.jpg"><br><br>  Let's start with a 9-volt PP3 battery, conceived as a smart alternative to conventional batteries, which are equipped with smoke detectors and fire alarms.  Unlike the latter, Roost is equipped with a wireless module and a pair of useful sensors.  When an alarm is triggered, the smart battery sends an alarm message to the host‚Äôs smartphone, duplicating it with an emergency signal to the nearest emergency service.  In addition, Roost can warn the owner when the battery charge drops to a critical level and the alarm is about to fall asleep. <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  2. <b><a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1343942869/steaklocker-the-first-in-home-dry-age-steak-fridge">SteakLocker</a> : dry meat exposure at home</b> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/333/e25/4ee/333e254ee7eb45e5bf693012c6eb0135.jpg"><br><br>  Gourmets who wanted to impart special softness with their steaks and chops and at the same time retain a rich taste invented dry meat aging.  In the past, only dry-food cabinets could afford dry shutter speeds.  Now this technology is rapidly gaining popularity among the "masses" thanks to a device called SteakLocker.  The device is a compact metal cabinet for home use, ensuring full compliance with the technology of dry exposure.  The presence of Wi-Fi and Bluetooth modules, as well as its own cloud service allows the user to set parameters and control the cooking process even at a considerable distance from home. <br><br>  3. <b><a href="http://www.getchui.com/">Chui</a> : videophone with face recognition</b> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/285/f66/f90/285f66f907934b8fb9dc478b8d68a14b.jpg"><br><br>  Video phones and electronic eyes have long ceased to be a rarity.  But electronic locks with face recognition function are not often met.  Chui is an advanced videophone that plays the role of an electronic porter.  He recognizes the owners of the house by sight, opening the front door for them automatically.  Chui can also identify regular visitors by sending a notification to the owner‚Äôs tablet or smartphone.  If the guest is not familiar to the electronic janitor, then instead of a text message, the gadget sends a video with its image to the mobile device of the host. <br><br>  4. <b><a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/edyn/edyn-welcome-to-the-connected-garden">Edyn</a> : a wireless sensor for the garden</b> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/e7a/bbb/875/e7abbb8759164c10b222c9cb4f48d50d.jpg"><br><br>  The next gadget is aimed at avid gardeners who prefer to spend the warm season among the trees and garden beds.  Edyn is a universal garden device that provides the user with accurate information about the level of humidity, light intensity, temperature of the upper soil layers, saturation of the latter with mineral substances, etc. Unlike other similar sensors, Edyn is completely autonomous in terms of power - it receives electricity from the built-in solar batteries.  And the measurement results are transmitted via Wi-Fi to a proprietary cloud service.  Thus, the owner has access to statistics from anywhere in the world where there is a mobile Internet. <br><br>  5. <b><a href="https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/cocoon-complete-home-security-from-one-device">Cocoon</a> : electronic watchman on infrasound</b> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/e23/0e9/99c/e230e999cf234bdcbe5f9353e6b522c2.jpg"><br><br>  The main advantage of Kokon, which distinguishes it from traditional security alarms and remote video cameras, is its multi-level tracking system.  In addition to the usual HD camera that sends a video broadcasting a living room or a hallway to a mobile device, the device is equipped with a sensitive infrasound sensor capable of detecting extraneous sounds in several adjacent rooms and even on other floors when it comes to a country house.  As a result, one Cocoon successfully replaces several sensors installed in different rooms.  And this security system is configured at times faster and easier than usual. <br><br>  6. <b><a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/hello/sense-know-more-sleep-better">Hello Sence</a> : advanced sleep tracker</b> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/be7/0ff/8a4/be70ff8a4c514a37a1d491d32faa74d4.jpg"><br><br>  As you know, healthy sleep is one of the key factors determining the quality of human life.  Not surprisingly, sleep trackers are so popular these days.  However, Hello Sence is not an ordinary tracker.  Rather, it is a multifunctional "sleep center".  In addition to the traditional tracking of fast and deep sleep phases, Hello Sence is able to track the level of room illumination, sound background, temperature, humidity and dustiness of the air.  Thus, the user can not only assess the quality of his sleep, but also detect the source of anxiety.  In addition, Hello Sence can be used as a generator of white or pink noise that obscures extraneous sounds, as well as a ‚Äúsmart alarm clock‚Äù that facilitates easy and fast waking up. <br><br>  7. <b><a href="http://www.quirky.com/shop/752">Aros</a> : smart air conditioning</b> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/f00/a41/c41/f00a41c410504f37811c067e0412e80c.jpg"><br><br>  The first air conditioners appeared in America at the beginning of the last century, but the ‚Äúsmart air conditioner‚Äù is a completely new invention.  Most smart home systems include climate control, but so far there has not been a separate device on the market that would be able to cool the indoor air on its own, having learned that the owner is heading home.  However, Aros is smart not only thanks to the support of remote control and flexible automation system.  It is also extremely economical.  Aros special software allows the user to control the balance between comfortable room temperature and energy costs, offering an optimal cooling scheme with minimal power consumption. <br><br>  8. <b><a href="http://august.com/">August SmartLock</a> : smart door lock</b> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/7a3/033/5bc/7a30335bcbcb414394a3ec4a6571c6d3.jpg"><br><br>  Most modern smartphones replace dozens of different devices.  The August SmartLock electronic lock provides them with another useful option - the ability to use a mobile phone to get into their own home.  August SmartLock opens with the help of special digital keys, which the host sends to all its inhabitants and other welcome visitors.  Such keys can be permanent, temporary or one-time.  A valuable feature of the device is its complete non-volatility.  The gadget is powered by two finger-type batteries and warns the owner in time when their charge comes to an end. <br><br>  9. <b><a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/smartrico/rico-turn-your-used-smartphone-into-a-smarthome-de">Rico</a> : home tracker or second life of old smartphones</b> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/f29/81d/bb3/f2981dbb3ba64a289fee87758c84a93c.jpg"><br><br>  Rico is another home tracker that uses old smartphones as its own ‚Äúelectronic brains‚Äù.  It is enough to install an outdated iPhone in Rico and the device receives support for Wi-Fi and 3G, acquires a built-in microphone and speakers, and also has the ability to perform video broadcast in HD quality.  By the way, Rico can be used without a smartphone.  The basic kit includes motion sensors, temperature, smoke and humidity.  In addition, the device comes with ‚Äúsmart sockets‚Äù that allow you to turn on and off your home electrical equipment in a remote mode using a mobile phone. <br><br>  10. <b><a href="https://www.rach.io/">Iro</a> : electronic irrigation system manager</b> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/dd3/c2c/38b/dd3c2c38b20b4980a3e93cc866814cc4.jpg"><br><br>  In America, where this device comes from, own lawns are not a luxury - every self-respecting owner of a country house has a green lawn.  The electronic manager Iro is designed to automate the garden irrigation system, teaching it to coordinate its work with current weather conditions.  Thanks to the support of Wi-Fi, the controller allows you to control sprinklers directly from mobile devices, varying the intensity and duration of their actions depending on the season, the sun intensity, the type of soil and other factors. <br><br>  11. <b><a href="http://palatehome.com/">Palate</a> : Home-made grill for quick frying.</b> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/cb2/641/068/cb2641068f134af78b0fc6d7b93754af.jpg"><br><br>  In addition to the dry meat cabinet, gourmets received a remote-controlled home grill this year, which can give odds to many professional electric ovens.  Unlike conventional electric grills, Palate is controlled exclusively using a tablet, giving the user access to different cooking modes and a lot of fine-tuning.  Palate can be used to prepare a wide variety of dishes - from various types of meat, fish and poultry to roasted vegetables.  The cooking temperature is exactly matched to the type of dish being prepared and controlled by temperature sensors. <br><br>  12. <b><a href="https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/bistro-a-smart-feeder-recognizes-your-cat-s-face">Bistro</a> : clever cat feeder</b> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/56c/561/f64/56c561f648b34271bf770d5bd3329373.jpg"><br><br>  The next smart gadget may seem useful to lovers of cats and cats.  Bistro is an automatic feeder that provides pet uninterrupted access to food, even if the owners went on a long vacation.  Unlike conventional automatic feeders, the gadget is equipped with a ‚Äúfaces‚Äù recognition system, which will be especially needed if there are several animals in the family.  Like the other heroes of our review, Bistro is equipped with a Wi-Fi module, which allows the owner to control the power supply of his pet, even being in another city or country. <br><br>  13. <b><a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/sectorqube/maid-oven-make-all-incredible-dishes">Maid Oven</a> : microwave with interactive recipes</b> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/6af/649/946/6af64994600f4015a939f37f2dfc61b0.jpg"><br><br>  Maid Oven is an advanced microwave equipped with a full-color 6-inch display, with Internet access and the ability to store thousands of different recipes in the internal memory.  The device has a touch interface, supports gesture and voice control.  In addition to direct cooking, Maid Oven can be used as an interactive cookbook - the device has access to an extensive database of interactive recipes, which are constantly updated with ordinary users. <br><br>  14. <b><a href="http://cookmellow.com/meet-mellow/">Mellow</a> : apparatus for low temperature cooking "su-view"</b> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/adb/add/90e/adbadd90ef5b4d25a0fdc3a1691dc463.jpg"><br><br>  Low temperature cooking "su-view" is when ordinary products sealed in a vacuum package are boiled in water in hot water (having a temperature of about 70 ¬∞ C).  This method of preparation contributes to the preservation of useful substances in products and prevents their spoilage.  Mellow is an advanced installation of "Sous-view", which allows you to fully automate the cooking process.  For example, you can load products into a container before work by setting the desired degree of cooking and the time to which the dish should be ready using the mobile application.  As a result, in the evening you will have a hot, tasty and healthy dinner. <br><br>  15. <b><a href="http://www.quirky.com/shop/920">Outlink</a> : just a smart outlet</b> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/5fe/16a/74f/5fe16a74f04541f580082ad72dc8cb81.jpg"><br><br>  And finally, just a socket.  True smart - which can be turned on and off from any tablet or smartphone.  In addition to supporting the remote control, Outlink tracks the amount of energy expended and displays the results of observations in a free mobile application.  Automation of the outlet and access to detailed statistics on energy consumption help to spend electricity wisely and save money. <br><br>  Author: <a href="https://plus.google.com/u/0/%2BAndreyGasilin/posts">Gasilin Andrey</a> <br><br> <a href="https://twitter.com/MadrobotsRu"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/ac1/fc6/d2a/ac1fc6d2a19948c59791b0da6ab659df.gif"></a> <a href="http://vk.com/madrobots"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/933/ac3/0b6/933ac30b6fd24ffd82218148c2fb0917.gif"></a> <a href="http://instagram.com/madrobotsru"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/464/a82/e04/464a82e045a34bae81406fd0b640cf08.gif"></a> <a href="http://facebook.com/madrobotsrussia"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/0b5/542/136/0b55421365064901acdf0ed58cc4a111.gif"></a> <br> <a href="http://madrobots.ru/"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/63d/405/78e/63d40578ecbf48f28c62f57705c73eb6.gif"></a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/248251/">https://habr.com/ru/post/248251/</a></p>
