  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Alternatives to email</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  The report of the International Data Corporation and the McKinsey Global Institute shows that workers spend 28% of their work time reading and responding to electronic messages, which reduces productivity by 25%.  E-mail has become the primary means of communication for each organization.  Replacing the email is difficult, but, nevertheless, possible. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/ec4/b6a/0bb/ec4b6a0bb0b14f0ba774b3b045358b1d.jpg"><br><br>  Email has certain drawbacks that have forced owners and employees of companies to think about a suitable alternative that can effectively replace email.  E-mail lacks transparency, letters can be ignored or forgotten, they do not require an instant response, the average response time is too long, which does not provide the necessary efficiency in solving problems and questions.
