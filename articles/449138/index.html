Why IT people dislike bitcoin</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Any author who is going to write something about Bitcoin on a popular site inevitably faces the phenomenon of crypto heyterstva.  Some people are minus the articles, without reading, leave comments from the series ‚Äúyou are all fuckers, haha,‚Äù and this whole stream of negativity seems extremely irrational.  However, for any seemingly irrational behavior, there are some objective and subjective reasons.  In this text I will try to classify these reasons in relation to the IT-community.  And no, I'm not going to persuade anyone. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/be/tw/ho/betwho2g7kodacd-xkausg4mwdo.jpeg" alt="image"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h2>  Opportunity Loss Syndrome 1: Well, I could have bitcoins back in 2009! </h2><br>  ‚ÄúI‚Äôm an IT person, I‚Äôve read about bitcoin when it first appeared, so if I‚Äôd namayn it, I would have billions now!‚Äù  It's a shame, yes. <br><br>  Here we must go back ten years ago.  Sometimes it seems that the Internet has been with us for ages, and certainly was everywhere in 2009.  The nuance, however, is that it was then that he began to actively become part of the life of the ‚Äúbroad popular masses‚Äù, which inevitably led to the appearance of a huge amount of all sorts of creepy nonsense and fraud.  Remember, for example, "digital drugs"?  The peak of their popularity in Russia coincided with the advent of Bitcoin.

      <i>I myself could be in this group of "haters."</i>  <i>In 2009, I wrote articles for one computer magazine, and I was offered a choice of topics: bitcoin or ‚Äúdigital drugs‚Äù.</i>  <i>Having slightly dug up both, I chose ‚Äúdrugs‚Äù, because there it was possible to get plenty in there.</i>  <i>Ai-Dozer with ‚Äúdoses‚Äù of $ 200, Monroe Institute, well, that‚Äôs all;</i>  <i>much funnier than some Satoshi Nakamoto with his mining.</i>  <i>About the crypt wrote another author;</i>  <i>being a professional, he, of course, experienced the topic on himself, namainil several bitcoins.</i>  <i>And, of course, immediately after the publication, he took everything from the disk along with the password from the wallet.</i>  <i>Meanwhile, while I was writing about ‚Äúdrugs‚Äù and practicing wit, the topic was decisively deflated, and my text went to the archive.</i>  <i>It is even interesting, which of us is now more offensive? ..</i> <br><br>  Most of the imputed IT people looked at all these miracles soberly and put ‚Äúdigital money‚Äù on a par with ‚Äúdigital drugs‚Äù.  With the exception that the latter seemed harmless withdrawal of money from suckers, and the first - a potential malware, a kind of MMM with an admixture of either phishing or botnet.  Put some muddy program on your computer that takes up the processor and is sending something somewhere constantly?  Invented by some anonymous dude whom nobody saw?  And for this they promise me some kind of mythical "money" from the air?  No, thank you, if I have nowhere to put the processor and the channel, I'd rather connect the <a href="">SETI</a> : at least I will bring benefit to humanity. <br><br>  Well, now - ‚Äúoh, if I knew ...‚Äù Well, in general, no.  As practice shows, the one who, out of idle curiosity, still namaynil some bitcoins at the very beginning, by the time of the course at $ 20,000 had successfully forgotten the password from the wallet.  And traders that ‚Äúbought the cue ball for another $ 30‚Äù, being professionals, immediately sold it at $ 32 and fixed the profit.  And here lies another reason for Haight: people who have raised millions on Bitcoin at the expense of the ‚Äústrategy‚Äù of <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hodl">HODL</a> , as a rule, are <a href="https://ttrcoin.com/forbes-vstrechayte-parnya-kotoryy-puteshestvuet-po-miru-na-zarabotannye-na-bitkoine-25-millionov.260/">not distinguished either by intelligence or wit</a> .  But at the same time, yes, they lost it, a bag of money fell on them.  But they are units, as it should be;  lost much more.  Just about them do not lay down legends. <br><br><h2>  Loss of profits 2: If I had bought Bitcoin a year and a half ago ... </h2><br>  This occasion is the least common in the IT environment, but it should be mentioned to complete the picture. <br><br>  Consciously, billions on cryptocurrency bubbles were earned not by random people, but by professional traders and investors.  There would be no Bitcoin - they would have earned something else (albeit not on such a scale).  Smaller lovers <a href="https://medium.com/%40utex/%25D0%25B8%25D1%2581%25D1%2582%25D0%25BE%25D1%2580%25D0%25B8%25D1%258F-%25D0%25BA%25D1%2580%25D0%25B8%25D0%25BF%25D1%2582%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B2%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BB%25D1%258E%25D1%2582%25D0%25BD%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B3%25D0%25BE-%25D0%25BD%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B2%25D0%25B8%25D1%2587%25D0%25BA%25D0%25B0-%25D0%25B7%25D0%25B0%25D1%2580%25D0%25B0%25D0%25B1%25D0%25BE%25D1%2582%25D0%25B0%25D1%2582%25D1%258C-2-%25D0%25BC%25D0%25B8%25D0%25BB%25D0%25BB%25D0%25B8%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B0-%25D0%25B8-%25D0%25BF%25D0%25BE%25D1%2582%25D0%25B5%25D1%2580%25D1%258F%25D1%2582%25D1%258C-2de9b4364297">get rich</a> less, but they have invested a lot of time in understanding what is happening and developing a strategy.  And those who simply ‚Äúheard something‚Äù were mostly burned out (by adding an army of haters).  Just because by the year 2017, the mining period out of thin air has ended, a market has been formed, and in order for someone to get something on the market, someone has to lose.  Among novice traders, 90% are losing money, the same thing is there.  The chance to earn billions on Bitcoin even in the 17th, without learning, understanding and understanding how things work, about how to win them in the lottery.  Go about your business, where you are a professional - and everything will be fine with you.  And if there is a talent for trading, then it is perfectly possible to earn them now, trading at least Bitcoin, at least stocks, even options on barrels of oil. <br><br><h2>  Professional 1: Some mediocrity chop down money </h2><br>  We turn to the most interesting and, perhaps, the most important. <br><br>  Strictly speaking, both the blockchain technology and all these smart contracts are a fierce, nightmarish kindergarten in a programmer hell. <br><br>  Well, right? <br><br>  What is this ‚Äútechnology‚Äù of a distributed base, which requires electricity that is sufficient to meet the needs of a small European country? <br><br>  What are these ‚Äúsmart‚Äù contracts written in the language next to which the Arduino IDE looks like a nuclear reactor control system?  Well, in fact, the smart contract was specifically invented so that any John could write it, and any Mary could read it.  This is such a basic from cryptocurrency. <br><br>  Meanwhile, a year ago, smart contracts writers were offered some kind of enchanting money. <br>  And imagine a situation.  We have a cool team lead development.  A really experienced programmer who keeps track of all the new technologies, spends a lot of time on professional growth, has a good job with a good salary.  He knows that he can cut down three times more on smart contracts, but also understands that with these smart contracts his professional level will collapse rapidly, and there will be no motivation for further improvement.  Plus, he is totally uninteresting to deal with kindergarten nonsense, and there seems to be enough money. <br>  And he has a junior.  While stupid, but seemingly promising, our team lead has been spending time on him for half a year, telling the mind.  And then the junior goes to the developers of smart contracts.  Since that same sn is three times higher than that of team lead!  Well, in fact, well, what is it? <br><br>  It's a shame.  I hate it! <br><br><h2>  Vocational 2: Failure of hope </h2><br>  Let's return to our junior.  For six months, nine months, maybe even a whole year, he lived happily ever after, just like in the pictures from photobanks.  I was sitting on the beach, drinking daiquiri, something there is a kodil on the fashionable iMac Pro.  Life is a success!  Children - a jeep, his wife - a puppet castle ... well, or something like that. <br><br>  And then his beautiful office, which raised several million on the ICO, suddenly realizes that she is failing.  Well, it's for the devil, the office decides, let's close the shop until the money runs out. <br><br>  And our junior directly from the beach is on the labor market.  Where nobody needs him now, he cannot claim even the salary that was before smart contracts.  Everything must be learned from scratch, being content with absolutely ‚Äúridiculous‚Äù money.  And the money earned has already been spent - on the beach, on a jeep, on a puppet castle, and the wife demands a new fur coat. <br><br>  It's a shame! <br><br>  And who is to blame?  Of course, cryptocurrency, who else! <br><br><h2>  Cryptanarchy is canceled </h2><br>  Despite the fact that long-term and densely used on the Darknet to trade any bad things, neither Spring, nor Roskomnadzor, nor their foreign counterparts for some reason, do not rush to prohibit everything under the root, for a long time and densely.  It would seem, enter the article in the Criminal Code, and everything, no exchangers in Moscow City and no cups of coffee for the "gas".  Instead, at the G-20 meeting, <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/g20-country-leaders-call-for-international-cryptocurrency-taxation">a decision is made</a> to establish a working commission on cryptocurrency, in Poland they begin <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/poland-starts-its-crypto-tax-experiment-3165.htm">to tax</a> operations with them, and JPMorgan Bank, whose head is known for his pessimism about Bitcoin, <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-47240760">launches</a> his own coin. <br><br>  The casket opens simply: while the crypto-banks see in the cryptocurrencies the wonderful world of the future with anarchy, equality and fraternity, the states see in them the total controllable monetary units, whose history can be traced with accuracy down to the ‚Äúprinting press‚Äù.  And in the blockchain - the possibility of total surveillance of any movements of the subordinate population.  And let them still not really understand how to apply all this in their sinister totalitarian designs, rest assured that sooner or later a solution will be found, and not enough will seem to anyone. <br><br>  So far, the cases of rewriting cipherpans into crypto haters are <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/tim-may-original-crypto-anarchist-who-was-displeased-with-crypto-hype">rare</a> , but there is no doubt that with the dissipation of the pink mist the latter will become more and more, and the bright image of freedom singer Satoshi Nakamoto will darken to Doctor Evil.  To which he, quite possibly, was from the very beginning. <br><br>  But that's another story, but it‚Äôs not too late <a href="https://utex.io/%3Futm_source%3Dhabr%26utm_medium%3Dreferral%26utm_campaign%3Dcontent_crypto%26utm_content%3D2342019_1">to</a> get some coins for yourself. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/449138/">https://habr.com/ru/post/449138/</a></p>
