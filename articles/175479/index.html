They use Surfingbird every month. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a>

      The very first task that we have to solve is to be in the head of the user.  To associate with him with a recommendation system / time killer and show that the recommendations of Surfingbird can be trusted: <br><br><ul><li>  We start from the very first steps, that is, by registering - we show men the most popular categories of interests among men, to women - the corresponding female categories.  This helps us to launch the trigger ‚ÄúSurfingbird - Personal Internet‚Äù (now, however, only some users see this). </li><li>  Further, the user marks the interests, and we take him by the hand on the site in the first minutes, explaining what and how it works and, most importantly, what else is there on the site, besides the toolbar in the recommendations.  Not everyone likes it, but it is necessary. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/f71/411/5c8/f714115c89317a059b06fe6c3c3cf659.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/a8e/76d/391/a8e76d391a7862c4db7d7297dfdbb6a1.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/f7a/5b6/37c/f7a5b637c64a9e17364cace8e18c0167.jpg"><br><br></li><li>  If he missed the intro and got into the tape, we immediately send 7 recommendations to it, so that the new user has something to do before the first person likes it. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/8a8/358/508/8a8358508d00842bcf33f222440d8b76.jpg"><br><br></li><li>  Our research on user behavior shows that everything is tied to likes.  In other words, the user becomes ours if he likes 5‚Äì10 pages with content.  After this magic happens, we pull the rabbit out of the hat, the user is happy and remains with us forever. </li></ul><br><br>  That is, you always need to understand what action leads to getting ‚Äúyour‚Äù user and try to shorten the path that he takes from the moment he logs on to the site until the act is completed.  This is your main KPI. <br><br><ul><li>  Cold start.  When you come to us, we know nothing about you, except for your interests.  We need not to push you away with our insane skills to generate recommendations.  It's like meeting a girl and shouting to her in the first minute, ‚ÄúI have a huge dick, and I know how to handle it, trust me!‚Äù.  Excellent tactic, but not at all.  The first time we show you the pages and videos selected by the hands of content managers from the most popular.  That is, we skim the best pages and show you this at the very beginning.  Thus, we form the first impression of Surfingbird.  You think, ‚ÄúOK, even if I saw this photo or video, why not express my sympathy again.‚Äù  You like, we will know your preferences, and now the personal recommendation engine has been launched. </li><li>  Geography.  This advice is not for everyone, but if you work with content, there is a very big chance that for Omsk residents the jokes about Omsk will not be as funny as for Moscow residents.  We performed various experiments and concluded that content targeting according to geographic features has its advantages for some cities. </li><li>  Tactful reminders and tips.  In our case, this ‚Äúyou put few likes, so that the recommendations are better, put more‚Äù. </li></ul><br><br>  This page, made in 5 minutes, helped us increase the number of likes by 350% in two days.  Sometimes blunt solutions to the forehead can work better than mathematical algorithms.  We just say: user, click fucking like, we don‚Äôt understand anything about your preferences. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/128/9a7/7e4/1289a77e4b443bd8a56c6147c705d8f6.jpg"><br><br>  Ok, the user has registered, understood how the service works.  He liked everything, but sooner or later he will end the session and close the site. <br><br>  Our task is to remind ourselves and bring it back to us.  And do it regularly. <br><br>  The most active and free of our tools in this is emailing. <br>  Many will say that it is fffuuu.  But I will say that the percentage of opening letters reaches 25%, with more than half a million base.  So, it is ok, it works. <br><br>  We work with mail in the following order: <br><br>  1) The letter ‚ÄúWelcome to Surfingbird‚Äù (service capabilities, etc.). <br><br>  2) Personal mailing in which we remind that we select the content for you personally. <br><br>  3) Editorial distribution - in it we collect the most interesting, in our opinion.  Here we can fool around with the headlines from the series ‚ÄúBeer, torture and fasting‚Äù and try to expand the range of interests of the user. <br><br>  4) Project news - everyone loves to see progress, and everyone loves good news.  More often tell users about your successes and that you have everything under control. <br><br>  5) "We miss you" - a letter that is sent to users, if they do not come to us for a long time.  In the letter, we first press a little bit on pity, and then we offer the most popular content. <br><br>  6) Specialized newsletter (aka "Friday Tits").  It began as a joke, but now every Friday, users who have chosen ‚ÄúErotica‚Äù receive a list with 15 naked girls.  Why is this important to us?  Imagine you are sitting in your stuffy office or on a boring couple at the institute.  And here it comes, this is a magic letter.  You open, and there are selected photos of girls.  What could be better?  You are happy, you produce endorphins, and all thanks to Surfingbird.  For us, just such a bunch is important: joy = Surfingbird. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/335/894/842/335894842be492b309e9eb109ca9c58a.jpg"><br><br>  What we especially want to mention, we send through our mailing system.  Tried to use Amazon SES, but it is not only expensive, but also slow (maximum 90 emails per second).  The letter has a unique pixel to watch the number of discoveries, we also monitor how things are going through a <a href="http://postmaster.mail.ru/">special service Mail.ru.</a> <br><br>  In addition, we weight links with UTM tags and then retrieve data through the Google Analytics API to put them into our interface (rather than digging into GA every time). <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/49d/fb0/3d9/49dfb03d93096bc2777600b68f8341de.jpg"></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/175479/">https://habr.com/ru/post/175479/</a></p>
