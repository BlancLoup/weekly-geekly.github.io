  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Mars One announced the start of a fundraising campaign</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  On December 10, 2013, the arrogant project Mars One, so popular with us, <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3DicN29cdmw_s">announced</a> the start of a fundraising campaign. <br><br>  According to the project participants, the funds raised by the campaign will have to provide the research and development necessary to launch the first unmanned stationary platform.  Its purpose will be the study of the ground.  Recall the launch itself is scheduled for 2018. <br>  Also in the message says that the design of the first mission engaged in the company Lockheed Martin.  This organization has already <a href="http://www.lockheedmartin.com/us/what-we-do/space.html">managed</a> to make a significant contribution to space exploration. <br>  Under the cut - analysis of bonuses and promotions that we offer the authors of the project, as well as voiced video ad. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/eb5/90a/d6c/eb590ad6c46a5c0e3679420af00d4567.png"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  The sounded video of the campaign launch announcement: <br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/wGHAtoI1MMc%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,1500008,15700021,15700186,15700190,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhiLIbh6wSTXhka5ERaXQlZnmbSWhw" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  A total of $ 400,000 is planned.  Of these, $ 80,000 will be spent on the construction of a satellite (by the British company Surrey Satellite Technology ltd.), Which will be used for communication.  Another $ 256,000 will be needed to create a research stationary platform designed based on the NASA Phoenix probe.  The device will study the Martian soil, will look for water and conduct university research.  Lockheed Martin, an American company that has worked for NASA in all successful Martian missions, will be engaged in its creation. <br>  So, what kind of rewards do Mars One executives promise us for materially supporting their campaign?  <i>(in brackets the preliminary date of receipt of bonuses is indicated)</i>

      <b>$ 10 - access to exclusive information <i>(August 2014)</i></b> <br>  The most modest donation of $ 10 will enable the sponsor to get exclusive access to reports from Lockheed Martin and Surrey Satellite Technology ltd. <br>  This will always stay up to date and be the first to receive news and research results. <br><br>  <b>$ 25 - Selfies in Mars Orbit <i>(May 2019)</i></b> <br>  No wonder the word <i>selfie</i> has become the most popular in the past year. <br>  The sponsor uploads his image, and Mars One re-photographs it, but with Mars as a background.  The photo can be printed, or just share it on social networks.  Also the sponsor receives a certificate of participation. <br><br>  <b>$ 29 - Mars One Exclusive T-shirt <i>(March 2014)</i></b> <br>  Donating this amount will allow the first 200 benefactors to get a T-shirt with a design that won first place in the 2013 contest.  For the rest, the T-shirt will be available only after the end of the campaign. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/6ce/732/d52/6ce732d526362b04dab35940dff9ae88.png"><br>  <b>$ 45 - Limited Edition Hoodie <i>(March 2014)</i></b> <br>  Sweatshirt with a hood, ads for the sale of which are full of all social networks. <br>  That's just the design will be exclusive.  For men - the picture on the chest, in the female version - on the back. <br><br>  <b>$ 75 - autographed poster <i>(January 2014)</i></b> <br>  The poster with the image of the first module, signed personally by the founders of Mars One - Bass Landdorp and Arno Wilders.  By the way, delivery around the world is free. <br><br>  <b>$ 90 - Your Tweet on a Landing Parachute <i>(February 2019)</i></b> <br>  The sum of $ 90 will allow the sponsor to leave any message up to 140 characters long on a parachute, which will remain on the surface of Mars until it is picked up by our colonist descendants.  This cost of posting a message will be available only to the first hundred sponsors. <br><br>  <b>$ 250 - Mars One Family Set <i>(March 2014)</i></b> <br>  The family, who decided to support the project with a sum of $ 250, will receive as a gift a set of 4 T-shirts, 4 coffee cups, as well as a poster similar to the one you can get for $ 75, and exclusive window stickers.  Worldwide shipping is free. <br><br>  <b>$ 750 - VIP invitation to meet in 2014 <i>(May 2014)</i></b> <br>  An exclusive invitation awaits the benefactor, who shares $ 750.  The meeting will be attended by representatives of the project: scientists, sponsors, as well as the founders.  That's just the flight and accommodation in Amsterdam sponsor pays for himself. <br><br>  <b>$ 1,250 - sending your image to Mars <i>(May 2019)</i></b> <br>  The image will not be just a digital copy - it will be printed in 3x4 format, as if for a passport.  The photo will land on the surface along with a research platform, in a small box.  On the back of the card you can write a message.  But you do not have to be photographed on a Martian passport.  In addition, the sponsor receives a certificate of participation. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/e47/55a/428/e4755a42865d17b6f5c3cbed6d7a2f0f.png"><br>  <b>$ 5,000 - invitation to the party on the day of the launch of the mission <i>(January 2014 - invitation)</i></b> <br>  Those who decide to support the project with this amount will have the opportunity to attend a party that will be held immediately after the launch of the first module in May 2018.  Additionally, the sponsor will be able to upload his logo to the Mars One sponsors page on the project site, or leave his name on the project benefactors page. <br><br>  <b>$ 5,000 - Gold 585 Sample <i>(January 2014)</i></b> <br>  The exclusive commemorative coin of the Mars One project can be a great addition to the sponsor's collection.  Delivery on planet Earth is free.  In addition, the sponsor gets to the page of the benefactors of the project. <br><br>  <b>$ 10,000 - personal presentation of the project <i>(January 2014)</i></b> <br>  One hundredth of a million dollars will allow anyone who wants to invite Basa Landsdorp to a presentation at his company, where the co-founder of the project will talk about the ideas and perspectives of Mars One.  In addition, the company logo will be placed on the project sponsors page.  Bass delivery to any part of the globe is not counted. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/bd2/096/429/bd20964292556b6c416c16f3a6b1cd2e.png"><br>  <b>$ 25,000 - VIP tour for two <i>(May 2018)</i></b> <br>  The sum of 25 thousand dollars guarantees an invitation for two: <br>  1) For dinner the day before the start.  There, sponsors will be able to talk with the Nobel laureate and one of the project participants - Gerard Huft. <br>  2) For the night in a five-star hotel after dinner. <br>  3) To the party to be held on the day of the launch of the first module in 2018. <br><br>  <b>Project page on indiegogo site:</b> <a href="http://www.indiegogo.com/projects/mars-one-first-private-mars-mission-in-2018">http://www.indiegogo.com/projects/mars-one-first-private-mars-mission-in-2018</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/205586/">https://habr.com/ru/post/205586/</a></p>
