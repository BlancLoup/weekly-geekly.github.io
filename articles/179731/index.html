In general, everything is fine and wonderful.  Once, our management decided to keep up with the times and thoughts arose to automate.  We chose <a href="http://www.sharepoint-project.ru/electroniy-documentooborot.html">Electronic document management for</a> quite a long time, but either it was a pity to pay a lot of money, or some fake developers, in short, it took all this negotiation and presentation disgrace to abound.  In the end, they stopped at some solution.  The product is adequate, developed under Microsoft Sharepoint 2013 Worklite Docs (I am well acquainted with this system due to certain circumstances).  In general, the choice fell on him. <br><br>  We put together all of our corporate Wishlist, ordered, implemented - launched.  Everything is fine, everything works.  But that's not the point.  It was a saying. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  I was washed on vacation, well, and wore off as usual for the May couple of weeks, scoring categorically for everything and everyone.  Before that, everything was rechecked safely, making reserves, and putting an assistant in his place.  And the guy is - I must say a little stupid, but extremely meticulous - moreover, to the place and out of place.  Strictly, I forbade him to touch or touch anything, and if there is anything to call me (and I remotely, like a real guru, if anything, I connect and do everything). <br>  I forgot to say that with their technical support I had some friendly relations, so we treated each other reverently and tenderly.

      It takes several days, I bask in the sun in a remote, but extremely favorable Mediterranean country.  And then there is a heart-rending call from my assistant.  He describes that he called the guys in technical support, with the stubbornness of Suvorov‚Äôs standard-bearer and for each nonsense (as far as I understood, he called there two hundred times and asked permanently some sort of nonsense), moreover, he could not even clearly formulate the questions. <br><br>  As it turned out the guys, the developers were humorous and tortured with this jerk - they rolled him a letter called "Memo for the client."  I neighing half a day.  Then I reworked it a little and bring it here - a slightly corrected version, in an artistic style.  Now she hangs over the workplace in my office! <br><br>  I cite the Content (omitting all the regalia and appeals on the corporate regulations): <br><br>  <u><b>Typical errors of customers in the implementation of complex systems based on Sharepoint 2013:</b></u> <br><br>  <b>1. "We will do it ourselves"</b> <br><br>  A fairly common method, which allows you to part with corporate money for quite a long time and without hassle, with the slightest prospect of getting something working or even remotely resembling a holistic solution, but how fun it is! <br><br>  Occurs approximately in the following algorithm (the chronology of events may vary): <br><br>  1) A decision is made on the implementation of a corporate portal and / or electronic document management <br><br>  2) The budget is allocated in a fairly limited amount (the customer knows in advance how much funding and terms will be needed for the project, right?) <br><br>  3) Performer search is carried out by the method of carpet bombing.  That is, a tremendous amount of time is spent in negotiations and presentations - the only purpose of which is to understand what it is and what it is eating with, and also find out whether it is possible to do all this for free and within a couple of weeks. <br><br>  4) After conducting 5-6 presentations, an opinion is formed that ‚Äúall this is not at all difficult, and our Successors are already well versed in the matter.‚Äù  But still, common sense will usually prevail and a parallel decision is made to hire at least one specialist (preferably freelancing - then you can not pay salaries) <br><br>  5) A vigorous squall of hands is rising with the words ‚Äúthis is nonsense, now we will sit for a week, we will understand and we will do everything ourselves‚Äù.  Moreover, the most common sense usually shows freelancing, looking at all this action on Skype - with sour doubt, but with a sigh - naturally takes on the job (whoever pays is the one who dances). <br><br>  6) Project management is highlighted.  With perseverance worthy of the sculptor of the Egyptian pyramids - he zealously tries to gather information about wishes for a future fundamental decision from departments, departments, branches of the company, glue the structure together in a visual form and sketch some sort of plan.  And here the most ingenious things happen, it turns out that no one wants to take any responsibility for decisions, cannot, does not know how, in every way he excuses himself and delays the moment of asserting at least some kind of intelligible edits. <br><br>  7) Having put together a less digestible work plan, the most magnificent part of Marlezonsky ballet, the formation of the Technical Specification, begins.  Is a song.  Moreover, we must understand that just a plan, a sketch of works and a detailed technical task with a detailed description of each item are different things.  This is where the first insight comes - it turns out that the payment for the development of the technical specifications is not such a strange thing at all.  And to write TZ personally, without any experience in principle, is a bit laborious ... if not to say more, it is almost impossible. <br><br>  ... A slight departure from the chronology listing. <br><br>  (all this time, the salary of all the participants is naturally paid) The average number of simultaneously employed employees is about three, with a minimum salary of, say, 50-70 thousand rubles.  All of the aforementioned violence of the spirit ‚Äî this is about 2 months ‚Äî means 300-400 thousand rubles.  about already pushed into the project, which in fact has not even started the path to implementation.  So we continue ... <br><br>  8) So.  TK is written.  A vigorous, but infinitely sad freelance began his painstaking months-long work.  For now, we will proceed to the design.  Naturally, for the approval of the design, it will be necessary to go through all the above-mentioned path (this by itself) - although in parallel mode.  (Some project managers prefer to engage in both design and TK at the same time, but usually then the project generally ends there).  That is, while freelancing sculpts the decision, the person responsible for the project goes through all the circles of hell within the company once more, and becomes tempered in interdepartmental battles like Hercules tearing the jaws of a lion.  In general, the design will be approved sooner or later, since the art part is the simplest, although of course it has specific features in conjunction with Sharepoint.  By the way, many companies believe that the design is not mandatory (therefore, the dull finale of the whole epic - it looks even sadder in the light of the standard Microsoft template).  But that later ... <br><br>  9) Next days stretch endlessly ... stretch and stretch.  Sad freelancing becomes even sadder, because to complete the project alone is quite problematic, and there are quite a few specific areas in the course of implementation, as well as unrecorded edits, errors, inaccuracies and so on. Do you remember the company of the forest? they help as much as they can - but it has already surfaced that so many things require special skills, experience, and that in general everything is not as fun as it was initially presented.  Accordingly, the project deadlines are delayed and delayed.  The person in charge of the project naturally ends up between the hammer and the anvil, and in general, he is already used to getting a scolding from the authorities and breaking against the wall of misunderstanding of the recalcitrant foreign freelance and the playful, but infinitely dear ITshnikov.  As the classics said, ‚ÄúThe roses on his cheeks withered and turned to ashes.‚Äù <br><br>  10) In such a funny ugliness, days, weeks, months pass (sometimes it even happens years) <br>  The result is usually sad.  On the exhaust it turns out that a strange, not very convenient, crooked oblique, with a bunch of static pages and the appearance of the pseudographics used in the mid-90s.  But what is the most fun it works!  Falling out of error, does not allow to do almost nothing (then for the sake of which everything was started) - but it works.  And even used !!!  Responsible for the project with the view of the Varangian cruiser - proudly glances down on the pale shadows of subordinates and even allows you to greet yourself with your hand!  It doesn‚Äôt matter that the funds were spent (with thin calculations) four times more than the Developer company would take, no matter what the deadlines could have been to conquer a small African country and build skyscrapers there!  It does not even matter that it is absolutely impossible to work in this, and opening the main page causes an attack of panic depression in absolutely everyone, including even the fish in the aquarium.  Officially - the project is completed!  Hooray! <br><br>  PS Six months later, the management comes to the conclusion that in the project all the same ‚Äúsomething is not right‚Äù and after quick negotiations with 2-3 companies (considering the sad and well-paid experience) quickly concludes an agreement with the official developer on the estimate. <br>  Dear Clients!  Development and implementation of complex and specific solutions on their own On the basis of MS Sharepoint, this is a sport of brave and contemptuous people.  Try it, go ahead, but just in case, immediately allocate a double budget and get ready for huge periods.  We are not responsible for your mistakes, both financial and temporary.  And even if you had already spent several million rubles and a lot of time on the previous front of your work (to do something on your own), this does not mean that we should pay you for your work at a reduced price by five times and undertake to do everything in a couple of weeks .  Appreciate your money and our time. <br><br>  <b>2. "We want cheap, a lot and all at once ... but better for free"</b> <br><br>  The customer is willing to work with a third-party executing company.  He has a Technical Assignment already paid for and formed by a third-party company, and he perfectly understands what he needs, but he doesn't want to pay for something else or, God forbid, stutter about money. <br><br>  It often happens that the customer already represents what necessary functionality he needs and is looking for the company of the contractor.  TK is already present and, in principle, the conversation is always quite substantive in all aspects except financing.  In most cases, it turns out that the client needs almost everything!  That is, everything is asymployed in the technology market (Corporate Portal, EDS, BI, KPI, Design, etc.), but the budget is so ridiculous that no developer seriously takes it as a potential client after the announcement of the maximum possible financial costs.  Moreover, the customer delays the amount of the budget to the public literally until the last moment, seriously counting on the fact that such a policy can roll.  Well, you must agree - the amount, for example, less than 500 thousand rubles, simply cannot logically be considered as a budget for all the listed functionality.  This type of customer - usually terrorizes - one and all.  Endless correspondences, meetings, negotiations - that would ultimately squeeze out the amount that can hardly cover Borjomi drunk in the process of nervous breakdown from the manager of the lead client. <br><br>  Adequate amounts (even much below the market) - plunges it into a stupor.  Like a golden widow with orange eyes, a customer swallows in a chair when he hears a sum of more than 100 thousand rubles.  and rolls his eyes with the thought that he was simply simply decided to rob. <br><br>  Dear Clients!  Please try to adequately understand the complexity and potential of financial costs in the development under MS Sharepoint.  At the moment in the world there are no solutions or opportunities to make serious development or implement such systems for such amounts.  It is impossible to introduce or even just launch the implementation of the Electronic Document Management System for 80 or 100 thousand rubles - for the time being, science is not aware of such cases ... Remember that developing from scratch to the specific specifics of the customer is different from the boxed solution.  And the proportionality of financial costs will be highly polar. <br><br>  When developing for the customer - you get exactly the solution - which is specifically agreed with you, and bears the specifics of your company. <br>  When buying a boxed solution - you get a finished product that is implemented in a universal form and will require you to have the skill of a developer in case of need for improvements.  In this case, you only receive a license for use and technical support.  But to refine it to your specificity or according to your wishes, the developer company is not obliged, if it is not agreed in advance in the contract. <br><br>  We are not responsible for the backup, recovery, training, experiments, ‚Äúbut I will try to do this like this ..‚Äù removal, and problems - which were carried out by your specialists during the operation.  We are always ready to help the customer, but we do not accept your mistakes or training without proper funding and documentation. <br><br>  <b>3. ‚ÄúWe bought a box solution from you, now we want you to train our specialist for free - because we don‚Äôt want to pay for improvements in the specifics of our company‚Äù</b> <br><br>  The customer orders and pays the box solution.  There were no conversations or references about the revisions or the training.  Well, why pay, right?  After all, there is a system administrator who has any skills, ranging from building a system of intellectual analytics and ending with designing ballistic missiles.  He can do everything quickly and efficiently.  So - the client‚Äôs management is paid for by the decision in a basic form (without customization and improvements) - the customer is supplied and deployed a product at his capacity, a sad system administrator or his assistant or assistant assistant comes (who sees all this pleasure for the first time) - and the game begins in the style teach me please everything to everything, I want to be able to like you!  And if you do not teach me, then you are bad and I will complain .. ‚Äù <br><br>  Dear Clients!  We are not responsible for the technical skills of your specialists.  We are always happy to offer our own - but each work, as you understand, must be paid for.  Our specialists will always be happy - to train, show, refine, rework, develop anything for you - but this will require financial investments from your side.  If you bought a car, the car dealership is not responsible for your ability to manage it.  If you wanted to save on the refinement of the solution for your needs and thought that your specialists will cope - it is implied that they have the technical specialties of this industry and can work quite easily in applications such as Visual Studio and Sharepoint Designer - while fully understanding the development logic under MS Sharepoint, as well as understanding the logic of the movement of processes in the EDS, instructions, EDS, development of web parts, etc. <br><br>  Technical support is understood as exclusively advisory work within the framework of the implemented functionality and does not imply training of your specialists.  Unfortunately, we do not have the ability to train customer specialists for basic MS Sharepoint skills for free.  We recommend such courses to take place in specialized institutions of the ‚ÄúSpecialist‚Äù level, or to enter into the contract and pay separately. <br><br>  I would like to touch on the same question in cases when your specialist ‚Äúkilled‚Äù the system on his side, deleted everything, distributed admin rights to the first people he met, or simply poured gasoline on the server rack and set fire: We are engaged in restoration, backup and structuring - only if clearly stated in the contract and as a result - it was financially provided by the customer. <br><br>  <b>4. ‚ÄúI am responsible for managing the project in our company, but I really want to go unexpectedly on vacation or just disappear for a couple of weeks - so that your technicians cannot contact me on the issues of interest within the project, and then I want to come and ask - why not ready? "</b> <br><br>  When concluding a contract for the maintenance of work front, we first of all necessarily insist that the customer be allocated a responsible person who will be responsible for the feedback from the client.  Usually it is the IT Manager or someone from the closest subordinates.  It‚Äôs good if everything goes smoothly, but sometimes it happens when a letter from our specialists remains unanswered, and when you look at the question in more detail, it turns out that the Responsible person went on vacation to warm his heels on a hot California sun.  In general, it is not bad, even as it is enviable.  "Ah, America is a country; people walk and drink there without a snack."  But I would like to warn you in advance or somehow cooperate in this matter, because, during the development process, oh, how many questions arise.  Because I‚Äôve gotten off - such a tourist somewhere far to the countries, and he didn‚Äôt say a word to anyone - take the time off as you wish.  And he will return - his bosses will be asked: "And how is it, Pyotr Ivanovich, our sorrowful affairs are moving, for example, on finalizing the document card?"  But Pyotr Ivanovich didn‚Äôt care either for his ear, he rested spontaneously, and he didn‚Äôt care about the document card, the document itself, or the authorities, and we, too, at the same time ... Well, as a result, let us write e-mails, Do you have everything ready already?  Where to look?  And why they say, you lounged, dolt, for our money? <br><br>  Dear Clients!<font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">In the development process - a huge number of questions arise, and you are required to verbal participation and prompt feedback on issues related to dual things or just clarifications, without answers to which it is extremely difficult to continue the logical chain of development, or there is a risk of implementing the wrong way. what exactly your company needs. Responsible on the part of the customer for the project - should always be available by phone, email or at least Skype. And a huge request to notify us in advance about the absence. If we can‚Äôt get an answer from you within a week, then we are extending the contract for this week, and you shouldn‚Äôt call every five minutes with the question ‚ÄúAre you ready now?". Sorrybut we have lost a week because of you and therefore we are not obliged to bear the costs of increasing the number of specialists - to meet the deadlines that were shifted due to your fault.</font></font><br><br> <b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Best regards, Worklite Docs Technical Support. </font></font></b> <br> <a href="http://www.sharepoint-project.ru/electroniy-documentooborot.html"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Electronic document management</font></font></a><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> and </font></font><a href="http://www.sharepoint-project.ru/"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">corporate portal Worklite</font></font></a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/179731/">https://habr.com/ru/post/179731/</a></p>
