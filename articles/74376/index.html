  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Fasting divine spark</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  There is a theory that there are two types of people: endowed with a divine spark and people who should do everything themselves. <br><br>  The first ones have WOW achievements without visible effort.  They get one movie role to secure a glorious career, earn a million dollars in half a year, make a brilliant film from the first or second time.  In the end, it was they who created Google.  Their main distinguishing feature is the speed of getting the result. <br><br>  The second group of people is a bit more complicated.  Among them there are also brilliant directors, millionaires, creators of huge corporations.  But they have to do everything themselves.  Before playing a great role, they will act in 20 films.  On the creation of a corporation they have spent decades of hard work.  And the directors make Oscar-winning films at sunset.  All these people are united by the presence of failures, they all have to repeatedly start anew, learn from their mistakes.  Their path is long and thorny.

      All, of course, not as simple as I described.  There are always gradations, but each person, according to this theory, is closer either to one group or to another. <br><br>  WHAT IS HERE IMPORTANT ?! <br><br>  And it is important to have time to determine which group you belong to.  For many in life it is very important to understand I AM NOT GENIUS!  THERE IS NO SPARING GOD IN ME!  And stop waiting, work hard, get used to defeats, make sure that self-esteem does not suffer from this, to know that this is a natural way for people like you.  Try, try again and try again.  Then take a little breath and try again.  Do not feed in my head the thought of a bright future, but do something right now.  Think better and do it again. <br><br>  And if this is not done in time, then there is a chance that in old age, looking back at your life path, you still will not find there something brilliant.  Although any creator in his youth considers himself endowed with the caviar of God. <br><br>  silence silence silence silence silence silence silence silence silence silence silence silence silence <br><br>  There <a href="http://skvo-net.livejournal.com/">is</a> no divine spark in <a href="http://skvo-net.livejournal.com/">me</a> .  This thought at one time was so painful that the body got used to it for several years.  All my achievements, both in creativity and in business, stand on a huge mountain of bone-defeats. <br><br>  But the fact that I realized this very early helped me quickly (within human life) to achieve many results.  And now I have experience.  None of my projects is a matter of life, and the projects themselves are always at least 4. This allows me to almost not notice how some of them collapse and continue to go further. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/74376/">https://habr.com/ru/post/74376/</a></p>
