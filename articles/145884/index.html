This post is about how remote work can be done from almost anywhere and about my little experience of using this feature. <br><br>  There are guys who are going and going to Thailand or else where, there are guys who work on the island, but until recently for me it was more exotic than a real guide to action.  Still, distant work began to be perceived more as an opportunity to ‚Äúget to work on a stationary bike,‚Äù and I made no special attempts to move the workplace.  And now I have the opportunity.  Not the most popular way to travel in our home country was chosen in a mobile home.  Here is such a device <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/bed/126/c5c/bed126c5c88668eaf5cde383288a6799.jpg"><br>  American.  Voracious, hefty, old.  But here I am happy and so, the car is not mine.

    <h5>  There are ways to travel with several advantages and features. </h5><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  - Independence from local housing.  Both from the availability and prices of it. <br>  - Ability to live where you can not even live in a tent.  For example, you can just stand on the sidelines. <br>  - Ability to choose a place with good internet coverage.  On the topic topic is quite relevant. <br>  - You can take your wife and / or friends with you.  Not much, but a total of four or six of us - can be accommodated.  If you even settle people nearby in tents - you can even more. <br>  - Quick and easy parking change.  No need to collect the camp for a long time, pack your things.  Like unpacking. <br>  - Small load associated with the move.  Moving is easy, and after that you do not get tired. <br>  - Always with you the familiar atmosphere, familiar bed and kitchen.  No need to get used to the new. <br>  - Stationary full kitchen, refrigerator.  Bathroom and shower.  Heater and air conditioning. <br>  - You can take, for example, a bicycle with you.  What we actually did. <br><br><h5>  Disadvantages.  For mobility you have to pay. </h5><br>  - The room is one.  With all that it implies. <br>  - The room is small.  In the event of bad weather, you can, of course, drink tea all together or read a book, but it won't work out. <br>  - Autonomy is not too high - water supply for 2-4 days, drains need to be regularly drained somewhere. <br>  - Electricity is expensive.  Generator + batteries.  About this below. <br>  - The Internet is not always there where you want.  Often this is the mobile Internet. <br>  - High fuel consumption.  About 20 liters of diesel per hundred.  The peculiarity of this particular apparatus. <br>  - Not too high permeability (This is not a jeep. Although ...) <br>  - In some places still have to pay for parking or travel. <br><br>  Another difficulty - to find companions.  Still, only a remote worker can leave for a long time, and there are not so many of them.  On the other hand, it is possible to take turns and even in case of urgent need to take the train and go home.  Easier than traveling abroad and with hikes away from civilization.  On wheels all the same. <br>  In general, it turns out a transitional - intermediate option.  On the one hand, freedom is like with a tent, on the other hand, convenience is like in an apartment.  A very peculiar set.  Probably, it looks like a well-equipped summer house, which can be placed anywhere.  Only without annoying neighbors and with a changeable landscape at will. <br><br><h5>  A little about power. </h5><br>  On board there is a generator running on gas.  The car itself eats diesel, and the generator - gas.  We have to look after two types of fuel, it is not very convenient.  But cheaper.  The generator is large, at 4 kilowatts.  So big it is needed to power the air conditioner (which is not yet in service) and the microwave.  Since the car is American (through) - at the output of 110V.  This turned out to be no problem at all, most modern chargers work without any problems from 110V.  It is written on them - 100-240V.  Just bought an adapter for the outlet, and you're done.  When working, the generator is not weak because it eats gas, about 2 liters per hour.  Even a little noise.  I did not really want to rumble about the whole eight-hour working day.  There were 4 lead batteries 12V 12A * h and an inverter.  Since the laptop is running from a 4.8 Ah battery for about an hour and a half, it would have had to work for 15 hours from batteries. So there should be two laptops, so 7-8 hours should be kept.  Such a scheme of work was chosen - we work on batteries for 4 hours, then we turn on the generator for 4 hours and work from it.  During this time, the batteries are fully charged.  That's how it happened.  Money goes $ 7 a day.  During battery operation, they worked in power saving mode.  Although this is lead and quite voluminous, it still had to save electricity.  Of course, the generator did not save anything from the generator - it has a foolishness with a margin, and our meager loads do not affect its consumption.  The rest of the electrics worked from the starter battery, it also never rested.  Light, pump, exhaust - it was separate from our working battery. <br>  Now I plan to use this battery as a big bespereboynik. <br>  It would be possible to buy a smaller generator, it would be possible to set it aside so that it is less noisy.  But then neither the refrigerator, nor the conditioner, nor a microwave would work from it.  And the generator itself costs money. <br><br><h5>  the Internet </h5> <br>  The Internet from peoplenet is a kind of Ukrainian CDMA operator in some places.  I got internet on my laptop when I needed it, they placed an antenna on the roof.  Further on wifi on the second laptop.  If you look at the coverage maps, you can move freely enough.  Plus for the weekend you can do without the Internet.  The coating is quite decent, you can use yourself.  We did not need high speeds, almost everywhere we needed access - it was.  The coast is covered well.  If you need to completely sideways, you can probably use GPRS.  But it is quite sad. <br><br>  When I planned all this action, I knew in advance that I would continue to work.  I got ready, bought an antenna and looked through coverage maps.  There was no special route, we just went where we wanted.  We looked at the photos on the Internet, maps, put a point on the GPS and drove on.  Were removed from the parking lot when the place was annoying.  Nobody drove us and nothing pressed.  Absolute freedom. <br><br>  Of course, at lunch we went swimming (where there was a sea), after work to have fun + weekends.  Yes, it is not all the time to relax, but somehow not bothered.  Moved in the evenings and on weekends. <br><br>  For the money it all cost something like this - $ 7 per day for electricity, moving home (500 km) - $ 125, at the place they drove somewhere else for $ 40-50.  In total, we stayed for 14 days, 9 of them worked. Two pairs of weekends + one for the Trinity.  In general, a little less than $ 250.  Once they paid 60 UAH ($ 7.5) for the fare, once they paid 30 UAH ($ 4) for parking on Ai-Petri and once for parking almost in the center of Alushta 50 UAH.  We went to the water park.  In principle, if we had earlier started looking for a place for which we had paid, we could have found it for free.  At Ai-Petri in the evening, you can safely enter the parking lot, and in Alushta there were enough places for free parking. <br>  In total, we were first five adults and two children, then three adults and two children.  It turns out cheaper local housing :). <br><br><h5>  Few places we worked from. </h5><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/d77/10e/67d/d7710e67de7599330bcbaeac8981a396.jpg"><br>  Under Chufut Kale, near Bakhchisarai.  The internet was bad.  Crop from a cylindrical panorama. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/581/1bb/217/5811bb217d39ad8da5ef7d690624946e.jpg"><br>  Under Sevastopol.  Kacha.  The cover is excellent, the sea is warm :) <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/cc3/82a/ab1/cc382aab196637ac2ecc778884c851bb.jpg"><br>  Balaclava.  The Internet is lousy, the sea is cold.  We did not stand here, just came here for a walk. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/0fa/1b7/182/0fa1b71825759710783116cfc5e361ae.jpg"><br>  Also balaclava.  Frenchman on the house.  He is in the picture next to his car.  Pleasant such uncle, cheerful. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/5fc/392/028/5fc39202880a4bb588339dc7d1e0a708.jpg"><br>  Under Foros.  The sea is icy, never got into the water.  Coverage is excellent.  I had to decently ride a bike until we found a place. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/73d/4fe/4cf/73d4fe4cf918620dec662aa2f33f1914.jpg"><br>  Ai-Petri.  Not working, the weekend, the coating did not even look.  In the evening, the tourists leave there, there remains a friendly and interesting local population. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/15b/fa4/434/15bfa4434d632a712e48665f552db69d.jpg"><br>  Ai Petri, from the top. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/ec0/4c8/439/ec04c843920f7b6cf5c7c0e410b3e844.jpg"><br>  Alushta.  The place is very passable, a good example of the fact that you can stand where you can‚Äôt stand anymore.  Not at all bothered.  Tinted good that the car is not visible from the outside.  Warm sea nearby, all sorts of fun too. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/a02/799/5ef/a027995ef6e8498b6e4217c69674d365.jpg"><br>  View from the other side. <br><br>  All photos can be viewed autohouse.  Not at all easy, but he is everywhere :) <br><br>  In general, it turned out that it is possible to work in such conditions, that combining work and rest is possible and quite pleasant.  If we take into account operating costs, it is also relatively not expensive.  Colossal mobility.  The level of comfort is sufficient so that it does not affect performance.  Myself, I would also like a motorhome, or maybe just a caravan.  A lot of equipment produced for this business, all sorts of lotions that will help you feel at home.  Before gaining some experience in the operation of such equipment, I did not know at all what it was, and certainly did not consider it as a means for remote work.  Now, if possible, I will surely go somewhere else.  It is not so important where, within the country, there are many more interesting places where there is Internet coverage and road.  And this, as it turns out, is enough for the organization of the workplace. <br><br>  Errors and typos please write in a personal.
