Given that the theme of the new Office 2010 is now particularly relevant, Ann‚Äôs answers to some of the <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/habrainterview/72176/">questions you asked</a> will now be most welcome. <br><br>  We will begin with the main, most burning question: <br><br>  <b>Do you plan to return the clip?</b> <br>  Indeed, we have stopped using this interactive element in office applications.  After analyzing a large number of user reviews, we learned that despite the huge number of Clippy fans, some users found this element of the user interface distracting.  In the latest versions of office applications, we paid a lot of attention to the reworking of the user interface and in version 2007 there was a ‚ÄúRibbon‚Äù.  The new interface has been created in such a way that it becomes more convenient and clearer for the user to select the required set of functions depending on the task that the user is currently facing.  According to the results of research and user reviews, Lenta really allowed to work with documents faster and more productively and concentrate on the content, and not on how to format or format the document.  In the next version of Office 2010, a new interface will appear in all, without exception, applications. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  <b>Will the owners of the Office 2007 package be updated to version 2010 and, if so, how much will it cost?</b> <br>  At the moment, we provide users with the ability to upgrade from a previous version of Office 2003 to Office 2007, for example, when buying online at office.microsoft.ru, instead of purchasing a full license, you can choose to purchase an update of the corresponding version.  We also plan to support the ability to upgrade from the current version of Office 2007 to the version of Office 2010 after the release of the new version.

      <b>What features will Office 2010 Starter Edition have?</b> <br>  Office Starter will replace Works.  It will include only Word and Excel in a very abbreviated version.  What will be the reduction of functions?  In Word Starter there will be no SmartArt graphics, tools for preparing reports with indexed lists, reviewing tools.  Pivot tables, pivot charts, a bundle of data between two books and the new Office 2010 Slicers will not work in Excel.  There will be no macros in both programs, and an advertisement will be placed in Office 2010 Starter. <br><br>  However, Office Starter will give a person the opportunity to use the basic functionality of Word and Excel 2010 applications, with a modern intuitive interface - Tape, and read all Word, Excel and PowerPoint documents, 100% accurately reproducing files created on full-featured versions of Office 2010 applications. <br><br>  <b>Will it be possible to stir ads in Office 2010 Starter Edition?</b>  <b>Approximate price level.</b> <br>  Initially, the Office 2010 Starter Edition advertising platform will advertise from Microsoft, which will gradually be replaced with global or local advertising of relevant products and services for users.  At the moment we do not have information about the price of this site. <br><br>  <b>Do you plan to introduce Visio into the Office Standard package?</b>  <b>Since this application is very much in demand by students, they would get all the tools for student work by purchasing an Office Student license.</b> <br>  We are very actively working with students and implement various programs that allow students to use our software at affordable prices.  A number of Russian universities have a subscription to our products, for which students can use Visio for free.  You can find out if your school has such a subscription on the <a href="http://www.msdnaa.net/search/SchoolSearchIntl.aspx">MSDN AA</a> website. <br><br>  You can see what features Visio has to study at <a href="http://visiotoolbox.com/academicshapes">http://visiotoolbox.com/academicshapes</a> . <br><br>  <b>Kodg Word 2010 will start to support the same feature set OpenType that WPF now supports?</b> <br>  Starting with the Technical Preview version, Office applications support OpenType technology. <br><br>  <b>In which version of the office is Natal technology support planned?</b>  <b>And what will it look like?</b> <br>  Project Natal is developed primarily for the XBOX360 platform.  When this technology is adapted to Office, we cannot answer yet. <br><br>  <b>Will there be new types of documents, and will they be compatible with the old versions?</b> <br>  With version 2007, we offered to the market the Open XML standard file format (IS29500).  In the next version we are also working on supporting this file format. <br><br>  <b>Are you going to reset the fat from your software - to reduce its size, occupied by the RAM, to work on speed?</b>  <b>On netbooks, Office, which has become overwhelmed in recent years, is unusable, and this class of devices continues to multiply.</b> <br>  We plan that the Office 2010 distribution will take up less space than Office 2007, but now the trial versions of Office are successfully installed by PC manufacturers on various netbooks.  As part of the launch of Office 2010, we will give people the opportunity to use the Click-to-run download option, which allows you to minimize the amount of hard disk space required. <br><br>  <b>Will it be possible to join the desktop office via a mobile (not on Windows Mobile)?</b> <br>  A large number of partners have begun work on providing the opportunity to work with Office using their mobile phones and communicators, the most notable is Nokia, which will add Office Mobile to their phones.  More details can be found here <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/presspass/press/2009/aug09/08-12pixipr.mspx">www.microsoft.com/presspass/press/2009/aug09/08-12pixipr.mspx</a> <br><br>  <b>Do you plan to release Visio for Mac?</b>  <b>The application is very popular, and the alternative level is not enough.</b> <br>  There is currently no release for Visio for the Mac platform. <br><br>  <b>How can I get Office 2010 Starter Edition, and will be able to get it for free?</b> <br>  Office 2010 Starter Edition will be available to users as a pre-installed component of the trial image of Office 2010 on new PCs.  Thus, buying a new PC from an international manufacturer, or from a local collector, you can get Office Starter with the trial version of Office 2010. <br><br>  PS: it is a pity that Ann, like many of her other colleagues, answered the questions dryly and in a press release.  Oh, this Microsoft ... </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/76093/">https://habr.com/ru/post/76093/</a></p>
