  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Is Apple preparing its own search engine?</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  This week's well-known TechCrunch resource <a href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/Techcrunch/~3/NOZLYlUE_7c/">asked an interesting question</a> : Is Apple preparing its own search service?  Receiving numerous messages with a similar question, it would be strange for journalists of the resource not to try to sort out the situation.  What they did, and I, in turn, present this information to you in a slightly adapted form. <br><br>  At first glance, the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãcreating a search engine by the apple makers does not seem so crazy.  Safari browser currently has 6-7% of the market, and all iPhone / iPod Touch owners use Google search by default.  In addition, Mobile Me subscribers have a powerful enough toolkit, using which thousands of people return to the server dozens of times daily.  All this traffic and tools, as a rule, translate into millions of search queries that can be effectively monetized. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Further, Apple certainly cannot be happy with the fact that Google now owns its own Android mobile platform, which means it is in direct competition.  Google CEO Eric Schmidt, who sits on the Apple board of directors, is not present at Apple‚Äôs mobile strategy discussions, for whatever reason - I think it is understandable, for the sake of commercial secrets. <br><br>  The only thing that does not converge under any circumstances is a simple fact: if Apple were to prepare a search engine, they would furiously recruit experts and search engineers.  TechCrunch interviewed several dozen prominent employees of large companies and made conclusions: some of them were exactly the same rumors, but none of the companies did not leave employees specifically to Apple, but the most valuable personnel were not lost.  At the same time, it was not heard about the admission of well-known (in the search field) individuals at Apple.  This fact alone plays a serious role: ‚Äúit is impossible to make a product without people who know how to do it correctly‚Äù.  It‚Äôs another thing if such specialists already exist and are carefully hiding somewhere in the depths of Apple.

      Apple, among other things, is very fond of the percentage of ‚Äúsearch margin‚Äù monthly transferred from Google for dollars earned by Safari users.  In addition, the Yabloko is obviously not engaged in the search and advertising field in any way today, so even if some search engine were launched, it is unlikely that it will be possible to bite off at least any noticeable piece of the Google or its competitors market.  So why invest huge capital in the search? <br><br>  It is for this reason that the answer to the question in the title is: ‚ÄúNo.‚Äù  But the rumors continue to persevere and I would like to believe that there is a reasonable grain of truth in them.  The guys at TechCrunch even suggested that they were actually hiding behind this whole mountain of omissions and misunderstandings: Apple is not very satisfied with the current search situation on their mobile devices and, for this reason, are preparing a new / modified UI that is more convenient to work with search.  And this, with a probability of 99%, will again be built on the basis of the Google engine. <br><br>  Source: <a href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/Techcrunch/~3/NOZLYlUE_7c/">TechCrunch</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/44551/">https://habr.com/ru/post/44551/</a></p>
