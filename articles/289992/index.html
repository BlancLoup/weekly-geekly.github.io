The US Department of Defense is going to open its own office in Silicon Valley, investing in technology companies and start-ups, <a href="http://www.vedomosti.ru/technology/articles/2015/04/23/pentagon-stanet-venchurnim-kapitalistom-obosnuetsya-v-kremnievoi-doline">according</a> to Vedomosti.  The military is hoping to gain access to the technology of commercial companies in order to use them for developing new types of weapons, as well as intelligence systems.  True, the plans of the Ministry of Defense do not particularly like technology companies and venture capital investors, who fear the ministry‚Äôs bureaucracy, as well as the uncertainty of the defense budget. <br><br>  Nevertheless, the Pentagon plans to work actively in the field of venture investments, which, according to representatives of the organization, will allow to receive and introduce new technologies more effectively.  And this, in turn, will help the United States to remain the leader in the field of military technology, despite the fact that now China and some other countries are very actively developing their defense industry and everything connected with it. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Within a month, the Pentagon intends to open an office, which will be located on the territory of the Moffett federal airfield.  15 people will work here - military men on active duty and reservists.

      It is worth noting that now offices of hundreds of companies operate in Silicon Valley, including banking organizations and representatives of the automotive industry.  The US government has not yet opened its own representation here, but now the situation is gradually improving. <br><br>  It is worth noting that it was the Pentagon that contributed to the transformation of Silicon Valley into a world technological center, this happened in the 70s of the last century.  The Pentagon invested in the development of microprocessors, which were later used to create high-precision weapons, and even later in the development of computers for peaceful purposes, with access to the mass market.  Now the ministry is interested in developments in 3D printing, robotics and data processing for intelligence. <br><br>  The final strategy of the US Department of Defense will be announced during the speech by Secretary of Defense Ashton Carter at Sanford University on Thursday  The Pentagon‚Äôs new strategy to combat all kinds of cyber threats will also be affected here. <br><br>  <a href="https://www.iqt.org/">In-Q-Tel</a> , which was founded back in 1999 by US intelligence services, will be used as the basis for the creation of a state venture fund.  During its activity, this company has invested in many projects, including a project by Keyhole, which is a key technology for the Google Earth service. <br><br>  According to specialists, when starting work in the field of venture investment, the Pentagon should be prepared for failures, since this is a business where the risks are quite high. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/289992/">https://habr.com/ru/post/289992/</a></p>
