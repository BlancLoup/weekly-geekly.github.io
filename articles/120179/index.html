  <section class="page js-page"><h1>How will the Sensor and Location platform in Windows 7 change our lives</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/windows/63401/">The Sensor and Location platform in Windows 7</a> is a large platform for working with various sensors.  Sensors are needed for more information about the environment.  In particular, this applies to portable devices: laptop, tablet.  A typical example is the change in brightness of a laptop display, depending on the level of ambient lighting.  If the user goes to the park and sits down on a bench on a sunny bright day, then the set brightness of the display will most likely not be enough for him.  The sensor reads the values ‚Äã‚Äãof the illumination level, the obtained value will be used by the screen brightness control program using the Sensor and Location platform, and set the corresponding brightness. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  The advantage of this platform is that it provides universal access to sensors.  As a result, a sensor of any complexity level can be developed, the resulting values ‚Äã‚Äãwill be available to any desktop application.  At the moment, while there are few applications using the Sensor and Location platform.  Available documentation describes the technical side of the use of sensors, without wide coverage of the scope of use and tasks.  Consider the scope of this platform.  We are all eternal students in this life.  Alone, the truth is also teachers.  A student coming to class includes his laptop and downloads data for classes from the university network.  He has to manually repeat these actions every time.  But you can, on each student's laptop, place a context-sensitive application that provides all the necessary information, depending on the network connection point, wired and wireless.  The teacher will receive an automatic launch of the presentation on the subject, depending on the audience.  Pondering where to go for a snack, the student will receive a complete list of nearby cafes.  Going to a cafe, get a full menu of dishes for ordering.  After classes, sitting on a bench in the campus will find out who is next to you from the list of friends on Facebook or VKontakte.  Do not have to write: "Where are you?".  For that, to talk.  While in the cinema, you can get a repertoire plan, and book tickets even before approaching the box office.  If you can‚Äôt hold back your impressions, you can write a twitter post in the hall, without ‚Äúilluminating‚Äù the surrounding screen brightness.  Sensor brightness level (Ambient Light Sensor), carefully in the hall will reduce the brightness of the screen backlight laptop.  Having found the location of the host, it will automatically download emails, new posts from Habrahabr, software updates.  An employee who is actively moving during the working day will automatically receive a list of tasks depending on their location.  Any traveler, depending on location, will automatically receive the entire set of necessary data for a given region, ranging from maps to rules of behavior in these areas.  Positioning is not limited to the platform. <br><br>  New opportunities open up with man-machine interaction.  When entering operational data into the database, the operator may make mistakes, depending on fatigue.  The presence of these errors can be correlated by the time of day.  But this approach is not very reliable due to the possible different modes of human life.  Using the Sensor and Location platform, it is possible to obtain operator biometric indicators (pulse rate, body temperature, reaction rate) during data entry.  Sensors can be built into the front of laptops, keyboards, and mice.  In case of ‚Äúbad‚Äù indicators, the input data should be marked as probable, containing data errors.  And in extreme cases, completely block data entry.  Additionally, it is possible to massively record how the user responds to the program interface.  How he ‚Äúresponds‚Äù to the messages of the program.  What are the stages in the interface of the program require more attention and concentration from it? <br><br>  Developers of computer games, too, will not remain on the sidelines.  Many players are very nervous when it is impossible to pass the next level, or even completely abandon the game.  In the new understanding, the game will really adapt to the player.  If the user is overly excited, the game should simplify the passage of the line, not bringing the user to a white heat.  Conversely, with complete peace of mind, complicate the level.  And finally, the computer ‚Äúlearns‚Äù from the mood, select musical compositions, change the wallpaper of the desktop and change the color scheme of the windows to warmer or colder. <br><habracut></habracut></div>
