  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Getting Oracle Certified Java Professional Programmer Certification and Certification in General</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Good day to the people of Habra and the rest of the world.  This article is a continuation of the first <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/157165/">post about passing the Java Progammer I exam</a> .  Some of the information will be duplicated here.  Today I would like to raise the following questions: <img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/d4b/a36/161/d4ba36161c1e9d7832d1f27488c66b4d.gif" alt="image" align="right"><br><ul><li>  why do we need certification; </li><li>  what types of certificates can an engineer get from Oracle; </li><li>  what you need to know or learn to successfully pass the Java Programmer I / II exams. </li></ul><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br><h4>  Thoughts on the need for certificates (instead of entry) </h4><br>  First, some lyrics about why you need to pass certification (you can safely skip and move on to the specifics).  Each engineer, in one way or another, is forced to choose for himself a profile that will be his main profile.  This profile is closely related to the main language with which it works.  But everyday tasks almost always leave their imprint on the programmer, forcing him to use different parts of the language unevenly.  As a result, he knows some parts better and some parts worse.  He can apply some paradigms and patterns with his eyes closed, and for some it is necessary to open the documentation. <br><br>  Take for example the engineer who writes on Android.  Because of his specifics, he uses Java 6 most of the time and even being aware of all the innovations in Java 7 in practice, he comes across it less often.  So it turns out that, despite the inscription in the Java 7 summary, such a candidate may not always effectively perform tasks related to, say, Fork / Join or NIO2.

      So it turns out that people who are almost priceless in their workplace and themselves feel the depth of their knowledge of the language, sometimes even superficially interviewed on their own topic.  This is often the case with young professionals who really do not always fully know their language.  The certificate also confirms that the knowledge of a specialist is deep enough in all aspects of the language, and not only in multithreading or IO, or collections.  The certificate is primarily a stimulus for a deeper study of the language with which you work, and also gives a more objective idea of ‚Äã‚Äãwhat real knowledge a specialist has in this field.  Even with the delivery of the first level, I discovered something new, but about everything in order.  So‚Ä¶ <br><br><h4>  Types of Java Certificates </h4><br>  Java certificates from Oracle can be divided according to at least two criteria - horizontal (specialization) and vertical (level): <br><ul><li>  specialization (horizontal division); </li><li>  level (vertical division). </li></ul><br><br><h5>  Graduation of certificates in the specialty </h5><br>  All certificates are divided into three large groups according to the specialization for which the level is confirmed: <br><ul><li>  Java SE; </li><li>  Java EE; </li><li>  Java ME. </li></ul><br><h5>  Graduation certificates by level </h5><br>  In turn, in each direction it is possible to carry out a conditional gradation of the following levels: <br><ul><li><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/cf2/818/0a0/cf28180a0b1c8653562ff0d486df16b4.gif" alt="image">  Oracle Certified Associate </li><li><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/d4b/a36/161/d4ba36161c1e9d7832d1f27488c66b4d.gif" alt="image">  Oracle Certified Professional </li><li><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/5e5/f28/98e/5e5f2898ebf6408a2de5700f135ebc27.gif" alt="image">  Oracle Certified Expert Program </li><li><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/d4a/54d/412/d4a54d4125605babe56751d801dfcd75.gif" alt="image">  Oracle Certified Master </li></ul><br>  * <i>Java SE and Java ME specializations are limited to the top level Expert</i> <br><br><h4>  Java Associate &amp;&amp; Expert </h4><br>  In the types of certificates, it should be noted that, regardless of the specialization, Oracle places special emphasis on basic knowledge of the language and for this reason, in order to be eligible for the Expert or higher qualification, it is necessary to confirm your knowledge of the Java language itself by obtaining a Java Certified Preofessional Java certificate. Programmer.  In other words, regardless of the chosen specialization, the first two levels will be associated with the Java language (ie, Java SE) and no more. <br><br>  You can get Professional in Java in the following way: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/18d/f91/bcc/18df91bcca400abdf954bb41b866c36e.png"><br><br>  In other words, you first need to get the status of Associate (having passed the Java Programmer I exam), and after Professional (Java Programmer II).  I already wrote about the first here.  And only after that you can choose a further certification path. <br><br><h4>  Preparing for the Java Programmer II </h4><br>  Preparing for Java Programmer II is not difficult.  Mainly due to two reasons.  The first is that Oracle kindly provided not only a complete list of topics to be aware of, but also a full <a href="http://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/extra/certification/javase-7-programmer2.html">tutorial</a> to prepare where there is all the necessary information.  Also in the network you can find dumps with questions.  <s>For example, <a href="http://www.examcollection.com/oracle/Oracle.BrainDump.1Z0-804.v2012-07-21.by.sindhu.150q.vce.file.html%3Fid%3D359087">here it</a></s> seems that dumps with questions from free access have already been withdrawn.  But you can fork out and buy, for a small amount on many paid sites.  I want to say only that they all reprinted questions from the same source.  In many questions of error and in many wrong answers.  At the exam questions intersect with those that can be found on the Internet - 10 percent of the force, but, nevertheless, in these matters there is great value.  They clearly give an idea of ‚Äã‚Äãwhat level of these questions and what exactly they will be asking.  Having passed them after learning an official tutorial, you become much more self-confident. <br><br>  But, of course, the main assistant, without which it is definitely difficult to pass the exam, is practice, practice, and practice again!  It is very difficult to answer a large number of questions if you do not often use what is being asked. <br><br><h4>  How to order an exam </h4><br>  The design process remains exactly the same as it was when the Java Programmer I was submitted, so here I allow myself to duplicate the excerpt from the previous article. <br><br><blockquote>  Prepared and decided to take.  It is necessary to go through a simple procedure.  Register on the VUE website.  ‚ÄúWhat kind of VUE, but I‚Äôll pass the Oracle certificate?‚Äù Many might think.  Calm  Oracle itself develops certification, but trusts its implementation to a certified center.  He, in turn, has an agreement with the centers on the ground.  When registering on their website (http://vue.com/), you need to choose the scope of certification.  Then it is enough to choose a certification center, choose a convenient time, write down their address and appear at the appointed time. <br><br>  Payment for the exam passes by bank transfer (ie, card).  Cost - 150 USD <br><br>  There are about five centers in Kiev.  After a certain search, I stopped at <a href="http://www.flane.com.ua/">www.flane.com.ua</a> .  And did not regret.  Their office provided the greatest possible advice on the process of passing.  Geographically, they are located on Pozniaky (5 minutes from the metro). </blockquote><br>  The cost of the exam is the same - $ 150. <br><br><h4>  Surrender </h4><br>  Delivery takes place within 150 minutes (2.5 hours).  It is not allowed to bring even a piece of paper with you for delivery - all will be given on the spot.  The exam will be asked 90 questions.  They are all in the style of "choose the right answer" or "choose some correct answers."  Questions can be flagged and returned to them later, if you are unsure of the answer. <br><br>  Since November 2012, upon delivery, the result is not immediately reported.  The exam result sends Oracle to the specified mail within 30 minutes after the exam is passed.  So, after putting Oracle, it now kindly makes you a little nervous.  But this is not the only innovation, now there is no need to update your Oracle profile with a new certificate after delivery - everything happens automatically and after 24 hours all the information is already on the site. <br><br><h4>  What's next </h4><br>  After receiving the Proffesional, you can choose a specialization by which to grow and ultimately confirm your qualifications with another certificate.  I chose towards HER and at the end of the year I plan to confirm my qualification along this path: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/750/d14/021/750d14021a31c4f5be5affd16219a602.png" align="left"><br><br>  Moreover, Oracle provides a great tutorial for Java EE: <a href="http://docs.oracle.com/javaee/6/tutorial/doc/">html version</a> , <a href="http://docs.oracle.com/javaee/6/tutorial/doc/javaeetutorial6.pdf">pdf version</a> .  But, of course, the main training in this area is practice, and I‚Äôll tell you about one of my personal projects this year. <br><br>  And, of course, do not forget about a nice bun in the form of the Succsess Kit, which is different for different levels: <br><table><tbody><tr><td>  <b>Oracle Program Certification Levels</b> <br></td><td>  <b>Associate</b> <br><br></td><td>  <b>Professional</b> <br><br></td><td>  <b>Master</b> <br><br></td><td>  <b>Expert</b> <br><br></td><td>  <b>Specialist</b> <br><br></td></tr><tr><td>  <b>Program Benefits</b> <br></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>  Personalized Certification Certificate </td><td>  ‚àö <br><br></td><td>  ‚àö <br><br></td><td>  ‚àö <br><br></td><td>  ‚àö <br><br></td><td>  ‚àö <br><br></td></tr><tr><td>  Personalized ID Card <br></td><td></td><td>  ‚àö <br></td><td>  ‚àö <br></td><td>  ‚àö <br></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>  Ocm apparel <br></td><td></td><td></td><td>  ‚àö <br></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>  Secure Access to downloadable Certification Logos <br></td><td>  ‚àö <br></td><td>  ‚àö <br></td><td>  ‚àö <br></td><td>  ‚àö <br></td><td>  ‚àö <br></td></tr><tr><td>  Secure Access to CertView Certification Portal <br></td><td>  ‚àö <br></td><td>  ‚àö <br></td><td>  ‚àö <br></td><td>  ‚àö <br></td><td>  ‚àö <br></td></tr><tr><td>  Access Certification 3rd Party Verification Tool <br></td><td>  ‚àö <br></td><td>  ‚àö <br></td><td>  ‚àö <br></td><td>  ‚àö <br></td><td>  ‚àö <br></td></tr><tr><td>  Special events and hospitality at OOW <br></td><td>  ‚àö <br></td><td>  ‚àö <br></td><td>  ‚àö <br></td><td>  ‚àö <br><br></td><td>  ‚àö <br></td></tr><tr><td>  eCertificate on request <br></td><td>  ‚àö <br></td><td>  ‚àö <br></td><td>  ‚àö <br></td><td>  ‚àö <br></td><td>  ‚àö <br></td></tr><tr><td>  <b>Professional Benefits</b> <br></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>  Industry credibility <br></td><td>  ‚àö <br></td><td>  ‚àö <br></td><td>  ‚àö <br></td><td>  ‚àö <br></td><td>  ‚àö <br></td></tr><tr><td>  Higher average salary compared with non certified colleagues <br></td><td>  ‚àö <br></td><td>  ‚àö <br></td><td>  ‚àö <br></td><td>  ‚àö <br></td><td>  ‚àö <br></td></tr><tr><td>  Preferred access to cloud based employment <br></td><td>  ‚àö <br></td><td>  ‚àö <br></td><td>  ‚àö <br></td><td>  ‚àö <br></td><td>  ‚àö <br></td></tr><tr><td>  Fulfill Oracle Partner Network Company Membership level requirements <br></td><td></td><td>  ‚àö <br></td><td>  ‚àö <br></td><td>  ‚àö <br></td><td>  ‚àö <br></td></tr></tbody></table><br><br>  As can be seen from the table, in addition to the certificate itself, which is issued when Java Programmer I passes, which looks like this: <br><img src="http://peterzondi.drupalgardens.com/sites/peterzondi.drupalgardens.com/files/Certification003-OCPJava7.png" alt="image"><br>  for obtaining the status of Professional, a Personalized ID Card has been issued, which has not reached me yet. <br><br>  The Fulfill Oracle Partner Network Company Membership level requirements requirements also appeared.  This item itself is VERY interesting and deserves a separate article, because in some way it opens up new opportunities not only for the specialist, but also for the company where he works, but more on that at another time. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/172819/">https://habr.com/ru/post/172819/</a></p>
