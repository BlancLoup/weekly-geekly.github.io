The master prepares IT specialists in several areas of system integration. <img src="http://itolimp.no-ip.org/dot/dot.gif"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  There is a lot of information, so I am summarizing it briefly.  Those interested can follow the links provided. <br><br><h4>  About IBS </h4>  <a href="http://ibs.ru/">IBS</a> is one of the largest IT companies in Russia (5th place among IT companies, 1st place among consulting companies, <a href="http://raexpert.ru/database/companies/ibs/certificate/">rated</a> Expert RA).  Founded in 1992.  Main activities: management consulting, business applications, IT outsourcing, IT infrastructure.  The holding also includes the software development company Luxsoft.  <a href="http://www.itpedia.ru/index.php/IBS">Read more on ITPedia</a> . <br><br><h4>  Master IBS </h4>  The IBS company decided to independently train personnel for themselves in ‚Äúscarce‚Äù IT specialties.  The project started in 2006, in 2007 the first intake to the magistracy took place.  Training is conducted on the basis of 2 leading technical universities - <a href="http://www.mipt.ru/">MIPT</a> and <a href="http://www.misis.ru/">MISiS</a> .  Both universities recently received a higher status - a national research university.  Each university has a corresponding faculty and departments for specialties. <br>  <b>Education - paid</b> .  In 2008, 2 years in Fiztekh cost 210000r.  I have no more recent information.  IBS provides assistance in obtaining an educational loan for this amount.  <b>If the graduate decides to remain in the company after the diploma, he is fully compensated for the loan payments</b> (with interest), i.e.  you will simply receive a wage premium for 3 years and slowly pay the loan. <br>  <b>A hostel in Dolgoprudny is provided</b> , the building was handed over last year.  He himself did not live there, but the reviews are positive.

    <h4>  Specialty </h4>  You can read more by clicking on the link. <br>  <b>MIPT:</b> <br>  ‚óè <a href="http://ibs.ru/content/rus/561/5610-article.asp">Management consultant in the field of business informatization;</a>  <a href="http://ibs.ru/content/rus/561/5610-article.asp">Direction 220100.68 "System analysis and management of information systems"</a> <br>  ‚óè <a href="http://ibs.ru/content/rus/561/5616-article.asp">Business Application Implementation Consultant (SAP).</a>  <a href="http://ibs.ru/content/rus/561/5616-article.asp">Direction 230200.68 "Information systems";</a> <br>  ‚óè <a href="http://ibs.ru/content/rus/561/5618-article.asp">System Architect.</a>  <a href="http://ibs.ru/content/rus/561/5618-article.asp">Direction 230100.68 "Computer science and computing".</a> <br>  <b>MISiS:</b> <br>  ‚óè <a href="http://ibs.ru/content/rus/560/5605-article.asp">Business Application Implementation Advisor (Oracle).</a>  <a href="http://ibs.ru/content/rus/560/5605-article.asp">Direction 080800 "Applied Informatics";</a> <br><br>  I am an engineer, so I went to system architects :) <br><br><h4>  What is at the entrance?  Receipt </h4>  To become an undergraduate student IBS: <br>  ‚ñ° Citizenship of the Russian Federation / Citizenship of Belarus <br>  ‚ñ° Bachelor‚Äôs degree, specialist, master‚Äôs degree or senior university courses (last two years) <br>  ‚ñ° Education: technical, science or finance / economics (depending on the specialty you are going to enroll in) <br><br>  Entrance tests: <br>  1. Interview in the company. <br>  2. MIPT: math exam, specialty exam <br>  MISiS: specialty exam <br>  3. MIPT and MISiS: English testing (to divide into 4 groups weak / strong) <br><br>  Subjectively: it is more difficult to enter MIPT, because it is necessary to pass mathematics at the level of those.  University (matan, difury, TFKP, terver).  But for applicants <b>free preparatory courses</b> are held.  So there is nothing super-complicated. <br>  Rules of admission: <a href="http://fibs.fizteh.ru/abitura/a_d8it.html">in Fiztekh</a> , <a href="http://www.misis.ru/ru/61">in MISiS</a> . <br><br><h4>  Studying proccess </h4>  Training is provided by streaming lectures and seminars for groups.  Classes are 4 pairs a day from 10:00 to 17:00.  Sometimes there are 5 couples or classes on Saturday.  Basically, all classes are held in the building of MIPT on m. Tretyakoskaya.  We had 1 day a week of classes in the city of Dolgoprudnom in the main buildings of the Physics and Technology Institute.  Some lectures were at MISiS on Oktyabrskaya metro station. <br>  Subjects are taught by professors from MEPhI, MSU, GUU, MIREA and other universities, leading (no kidding) IBS specialists.  Master classes are held with invited "gurus" not from the company. <br><br>  Education lasts 2 years (4 semesters): <br>  In the first and partially in the second semester, system-wide disciplines are taught: <br>  ‚óã system engineering <br>  ‚óã speaker design <br>  ‚óã information security <br>  ‚óã IT service management <br>  ‚óã quality management <br>  ‚óã architectural approach to business management <br>  ‚óã Russian business environment <br>  ‚óã economics and management of modern enterprise <br>  ‚óã economics of information and entrepreneurship <br>  ‚óã information systems economics <br>  ‚óã project management <br>  ‚óã large MS Office course (Word, Excel, Visio, Project) <br>  ‚óã business process design (ARIS, BPWin) <br>  ‚óã business competence training <br>  ‚óã RUP course <br>  ‚óã course on organizing work in a team of developers <br>  ‚óã overview of modern IT, SAP and Oracle ACS <br>  ‚óã and others. <br><br>  In the second semester, some subjects from the first block are continued, but basically, specialized subjects go for each group separately.  For system architects, this is: <br>  ‚ñ° add.  microprocessor architecture heads; <br>  ‚ñ° protocols and equipment of corporate networks; <br>  ‚ñ° data center infrastructure; <br>  ‚ñ° data storage systems; <br>  ‚ñ° fault-tolerant computing systems; <br>  ‚ñ° laboratory workshop on anti-virus protection, terminal services, etc .; <br>  ‚ñ° add.  heads of peripheral devices and interfaces; <br>  ‚ñ° add.  Heads of reliability, control and diagnostics of computing systems and software. <br><br>  The theory and labs were mostly on Windows Server, but there were also lectures on * nix-systems, they installed and labeled FreeBSD on labs :) <br>  And now in MIPT there is an installation of an educational laboratory stand with blade servers!  Alas, we didn‚Äôt have such a thing, but on the networks we were laying networks on the networks using Cisco equipment :) <br>  We also had an authorized Microsoft course on Windows 2003 in <a href="http://www.microinform.ru/">MicroInform</a> , everyone passed the exam and received the MCP certificate (Microsoft Certified Professional). <br><br>  In the second year of study, undergraduates undergo internship in IBS, participate in real projects, and receive salary.  There are no classes at the university. <br>  The second task in the second year is to write a master's thesis.  To do this, each distinguished supervisor from the institute and a mentor (consultant) from the company. <br>  Our group also completed a course on Windows Server 2008 and passed the exam. <br>  In the summer, after graduation, interns are certified by IBS and become full-fledged specialists of the company. <br><br><h4>  What is the output? </h4>  Excellent IT education. <br>  ‚ñ∑ Guaranteed employment in IBS at the end <br>  ‚ñ∑ Diploma of the prestigious university MIPT or MISiS (for bachelors - masters, for engineers - about extra. Higher) <br>  ‚ñ∑ The possibility of entering the postgraduate program at the Moscow Institute of Physics and Technology (last year graduates also entered the Institute of Applied Physics of the Russian Academy of Sciences, Novosibirsk State University and Moscow State University; <br>  ‚ñ∑ I don‚Äôt know what will happen this year, but in the past all graduates have also passed the certification of IPMA project management to the junior level E. <br><br><h4>  My point of view </h4>  Most of the courses were very interesting, greatly expanded the IT outlook and accustomed to a systems approach.  It is relatively difficult to study, but this is probably because I have already got used to freezing in the 3rd and 4th year :) Alas, I cannot say that I am a very diligent student.  At the end of the 1st, 2nd and 3rd semesters, there was a rather stressful research effort. <br>  Master IBS looks very advantageous compared to a regular high school.  This is especially true for consultants.  Now the institutes have neither material base, nor courses, nor teachers to read, for example, ERP-systems.  However, like any Windows Server or Cisco. <br>  It will be especially interesting to study here for those who, having received a bachelor's degree or specialist, have not yet mastered the IT profession and do not know where to go next. <br><br>  I will note some minuses: <br>  - You need to take a big loan or pay hard. <br>  - Compared with the specialty: writing a master's thesis seems to me more difficult than a graduation project, it is required to show the scientific novelty of the research, for the defense we need scientific publications.  But maybe someone is just a joy :) <br>  - DLS happened to work intermittently. <br><br>  Further reading: <br>  ‚óä <a href="http://ibs.ru/content/rus/rubr100/rubr-1004.asp">About magistracy on the IBS website.</a>  <a href="http://ibs.ru/content/rus/rubr100/rubr-1004.asp">You can find a description of all specialties.</a> <br>  ‚óä <a href="http://fibs.fizteh.ru/">The site of the IBS faculty at MIPT</a> - the Questions and Answers section is especially interesting. <br>  ‚óä <a href="http://www.fibs-ibs.ru/">New site (beta) FIBS MIPT</a> <br>  ‚óä <a href="http://www.misis.ru/ru/2076">IBS Faculty at MISiS website</a> <br>  <a href="http://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%259C%25D0%25B0%25D0%25B3%25D0%25B8%25D1%2581%25D1%2582%25D1%2580%25D0%25B0%25D1%2582%25D1%2583%25D1%2580%25D0%25B0_IBS">Wikipedia article</a> .
