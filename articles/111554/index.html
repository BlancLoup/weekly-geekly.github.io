  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Why Delphi "dies" or "programmer is not a reader, programmer is a writer"</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Hello, dear habrazhiteli!  Happy New Year!  I wish you a successful coding, a reckless code, understanding managers, intelligent subordinates and patience in parsing the code written by the predecessor. <br><br>  I want to share some thoughts about reducing the popularity of my beloved programming language - Delphi.  So, let's not pull the cat by the balls, but take the bull by the horns. <br><br>  In the era when Delphi was born, the personal computer began to be introduced everywhere where the benefits of its introduction could be seen.  But one computer is not enough to extract benefits.  There is also a <s>user</s> operator who works as an intermediary between business data and an information system, and the information system itself - the programs that store, process and issue these same data. 
      <br>

      <br>
      So, to get as much profit as possible, you need to reduce the cost of <a name="habracut"></a><br><ul><li>  iron component </li><li>  software component </li><li>  operator training </li><li>  information system development </li></ul><br>  It is because of these reasons that there are thin clients a la terminals, operators poking the right buttons in the right sequence and information systems written by students as term papers. <br><br>  Object Delphi, grown from procedural Pascal, has a very low entry threshold, provides minimal dependency on third-party libraries, and provides access to data stored in various DBMSs. <br><br>  If the design of the system the relationship between iron and Delphi is poorly traced, then the following three profit conditions are associated with Delphi very much. <br><br>  <b>Software component</b> , in other words, the operating system.  Delphi allows you to write programs that work in MS Windows, which gained popularity at a frantic pace - it‚Äôs not a problem to install pirated Windows.  How is it there ... J3QQ4 ... <br><br>  <b>Training of operators</b> If the operator knows the basics of working in Windows, then you can get by with a simple instruction that indicates which button to press. <br><br>  <b>The development of an information system.</b> A low threshold of entry actually allowed a student or a group of students to write an IC in accordance with the modest requirements of the customer. <br><br>  It is the low threshold of entry and played a fatal role in the fate of Delphi.  My free brief retelling of how it all happened. <br><ol><li>  Delphi became more and more popular, support of new DBMS is being introduced </li><li>  the number of projects implemented with Delphi is getting bigger </li><li>  the number of Delphi programmers is increasing </li><li>  the global (not only in the USSR-Russia, but also in the USA) crisis of technical personnel training begins </li><li>  requirements for information systems are complicated in accordance with the development of technology </li><li>  Delphi developers are mistaken in the direction of technology development (dotnet was not yet relevant) </li><li>  customers cannot distinguish a good Delphi programmer from a bad one - there are no certificate authorities </li><li>  the number of projects written by non-programmers is increasing </li><li>  the number of projects requiring support increases (changes in the code / logic) </li><li>  customers are increasingly hearing that "it is easier to rewrite than to fix / finish" </li><li>  and it is said as bad programmers who have not understood the code </li><li>  so good, whose hair moves from what he saw bydlokoda </li><li>  Delphi developers do not keep up with new technologies, although this is not critical, but ... </li><li>  more and more people / customers / executives start thinking that ‚ÄúDelphi is bad‚Äù </li><li>  Delphi competitors are not sleeping, and more and more "tasty" technology <s>cakes are</s> rolling out </li><li>  a good programmer no matter what to write, they ‚Äúgo‚Äù to another language, there are less and less good Delphi programmers </li><li>  Delphi freezes in development, brings losses, owners change one after another </li><li>  rumors about the <s>demise of</s> the development of the language </li><li>  Customers for new projects are trying to choose another language, because they are tired of rewriting the same thing from scratch, without the hope that all this will work in the future and that the project code will have support </li><li>  Universities bend under the market, Delphi are beginning to be excluded from student training programs </li><li>  Delphi is less frequently mentioned in technical circles, many <s>consider</s> it to <s>be</s> called "dead" </li></ol><br>  Thus, the main reasons for a <i>temporary</i> sunset Delphi: <br><ul><li>  low threshold of entry </li><li>  lack of certification centers </li><li>  management mistakes </li><li>  lack of "advertising" in the media, or rather the presence of anti-advertising </li><li>  lack of support for large vendors, unlike competitors </li></ul><br>  That is, the programmers were mostly engaged in the Delphi environment and the language, but their management is lame in both legs.  Everything rests on him. <br><br>  If these reasons together manifest themselves in another language / technology, then we can say that it also has / will have problems.  Take Silverlight for example.  He also has a low threshold of entry, but on the rest of the points they have all type-top.  I hope no one will argue that MS is not a major vendor or a vendor that does not support its offspring in all imaginable and unthinkable ways. <br><br>  Of course for Delphi, it's not so bad.  Now the language has an adequate host, the language is not shaky, it is not developing.  But the trust of customers / managers is hard to return.  Truth those who still remained faithful to the language, more careful.  For example, when recruiting to a team, they are more thoroughly trying to identify the level of training, not chasing new releases of the language.  Delphi 7.0 suits many people (like Windows XP :) They say that Gisler with Total Commander is still sitting on the second version. <br><br>  For example, I will try to describe the current state of affairs in my city.  A small handful of offices that know about each other, if not all, then for a long time.  All, without exception, are fed from the bottomless state treasury - there are a lot of tenders for the creation of e-government.  Within this framework, projects are developed mainly in C # and Java.  Zoo DBMS is attached: IBM DB2, MS SQL, Oracle, FireBird.  In the team: one or two hardworking gurus, 3-4 students or freshly baked graduates, two or three dead weight.  What is not always different people.  A team is from 2 to 10 people on 2-4 projects.  On average, out of five projects: one is new, two are refinement of the old, two are incomprehensible with something, as a rule, office work (SAP, DocsVision) or commissioning and iron works. <br><br>  So, almost always a new project is written either in C # or in Java.  Refinement of the old - it is almost always a fine finishing / alteration / repair written in Delphi. <br><br>  You look at all this and it becomes sad at heart.  But read the promises of Delphi developers and take heart.  And in order to help them in their difficult task, he convinced his office to purchase a couple of licenses and start one project on the fresh edition of Delphi. <br><br>  IMHO, can not such a wonderful language just gulf.  Be sure there are enthusiasts of the business.  So many wonderful programs written on it.  I want to believe that more will be written. <br><br>  I, in turn, urge fans of Delphi not to be idle, but to try to popularize it in their circles.  We will help some Embarcadero managers to correct their mistakes and support our favorite language. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/111554/">https://habr.com/ru/post/111554/</a></p>
