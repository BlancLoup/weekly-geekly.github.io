  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Why I will run away from school</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Good day, dear habrasoobschestvo.  I want to share with you my thoughts on this.  At once I will make a reservation that this is nothing but thoughts aloud. <br><br>  Little backstory.  In August of this year, I got a job at one of the schools in St. Petersburg.  It is not difficult to guess the teacher of computer science.  Apart from the development itself, I was really interested in working with children, trying to teach them something serious and, in my opinion, interesting.  I was well aware that not everyone is interested in computer science, but at that time I still did not suspect that everything was SO bad ... <br><br><a name="habracut"></a>  Actually, on the topic.  Why did I go there?  It was interesting.  It seemed that the School was something very good.  Still, how not cool, but with the school I have associated a lot of good, kind and warm memories.  And this is not only absenteeism and funny notes in the diary.  I liked listening to the teachers when they were telling something interesting.  Sometimes these were incidents from their lives, sometimes new material that took their breath away (for example, when a geography teacher told about volcanoes. I remember that very well, I was sitting with my mouth wide open and eagerly hungry shark absorbed new material).  Or a story ... This is not to say about computer science and mathematics.  Of course, for garlic, there were items that I could not stand.  A vivid example is physics and chemistry.  But this is a separate story ... And so we had the whole class!  Someone liked one thing, someone else.  Someone loved Onegin, someone logarithms.  Some were dragged from fossil bugs, while others liked, though mentally, but splitting them into atoms.  We were interested in something.  We always wanted to know something.  It was not such that we went straight to school, as if to hard labor.  Of course, they were skipping.  Of course "Damn, back to school! ...".  But we stuck to some framework ...

      And with these thoughts I went to work as a teacher.  I truly believed that there would be at least 15 people for the whole school with whom it would be a pleasure to work.  Which will be interesting to my subject.  But what was the result?  But in the end it turned out that ... One half of the children firmly believe that informatics is limited on Counter-Strike and VKontakte.  And the second one just ignores the item as such.  Of course, it could not upset me.  I worked on myself, I was preparing for lessons at night, I tried to make everything more interesting and clearer.  With presentations, videos, interviews with famous people, etc.  The reaction is zero. <br><br>  Of course, such a reaction hurt me.  I was just a human hurt.  And I went to my teachers.  To the people who taught me.  Trinity in many subjects.  And it turned out that I am not the only one who finds myself in such an <s>ass</s> situation.  It turned out that even the most authoritative teachers CAN'T interest modern children in their subject.  How not to spin that does not invent.  If you can still find an approach to kids (grades 1-6): arrange the process as a game, for example, or show a movie.  In general, to arrange some kind of non-standard.  All those who are older are beyond any control.  They begin to think that they are very adults and are able to decide for themselves what they need.  Yes, and good!  And the flag in hand, if they cling at least for something! <br><br>  Not to be unfounded - I will give a couple of numbers: <br>  <b>Grade 10:</b> the average class, comes out on 6 twos per person.  In the semester.  This is despite the fact that in class only 2 are ‚Äúwell-balanced‚Äù. <br><br>  Here is such a situation.  Of course, I understand that teacher‚Äôs work is truly titanic work.  And I can no longer.  And this is not because I am ‚Äújust tired and I need to rest.‚Äù  Here it is another thing, I guess.  Ambitions: I can not do something in the void.  It starts to seem to me that what I am doing is a fake that gives no real benefit.  Neither me nor children.  Therefore I am leaving.  And I know many more people who left here just the same.  After half a year, a year. <br><br>  And I personally do not see a way out of this situation. <br><br>  <b>UPD:</b> Moved to the learning process.  Thank. <br><habracut></habracut></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/77623/">https://habr.com/ru/post/77623/</a></p>
