One of these "extensions", which has become a real support for many of us - Wikipedia.  A unique phenomenon, knowledge accumulated earlier and created here and now daily pour in here the hidden struggle for influence on the minds of the masses by means of changing and sometimes even falsifying articles, from here get information about all scientific and applied disciplines.  Wikipedia is used by everyone, from children to presidents.

      Probably one of the most comical stories in Russian Wikipedia.  In 2006, the article ‚ÄúMayonnaise Bank‚Äù was created, which immediately found itself at the center of the scandal: some users demanded to remove the article as obviously useless and provocative, and some stubbornly defended it, enthusiastically nostalgic for one of the symbols of our Soviet past.  Mizgol, well-known to the whole of the RuNet, added fuel to the fire, which in itself is almost a mythical character akin to a unicorn.  He supplemented the article with a photo of a jar of urine, which caused another wave of hysteria, and the meme ‚Äújar of urine‚Äù received a start in life.  Three years later, a fairly overgrown article was still deleted, in 2010 it was restored and deleted again in 2013. Anyone can read a copy of the article on <a href="http://traditio-ru.org/wiki/%25D0%2591%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BD%25D0%25BE%25D1%2587%25D0%25BA%25D0%25B0_%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B7-%25D0%25BF%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B4_%25D0%25BC%25D0%25B0%25D0%25B9%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B5%25D0%25B7%25D0%25B0">an alternative resource</a> . <br><br><h1>  Fight for a place in the ranking </h1><br>  It is very important for some people in this world to measure ... at least something.  A vivid example was the story of five years ago, when the Russian-language section of Wikipedia, by the number of articles, came very close to the Portuguese.  Some Portuguese users found this a cause for serious concern, and with the help of bots began to create many stub articles, the so-called <a href="http://www.wikireality.ru/wiki/%25D0%259D%25D0%25B5%25D0%25B4%25D0%25BE%25D1%2581%25D1%2582%25D0%25B0%25D0%25B1">nedabov</a> .  At first, ours did not succumb to temptation and did not use the same method.  After some time, the Portuguese section took the 8th place in the ranking, after which the users calmed down.  However, the example turned out to be contagious and the Spaniards picked up the banner.  In February 2011, someone's nerves could not stand, and they began to create massively lack of resources in the Russian-language section of Wikipedia. <br><br>  In general, over time, bots managed to rein in, and the mind prevailed.  Our section in a natural way, not due to cheating, took the 8th place in the rating, which it now occupies.  At the same time, in 2014, the Russian-language section became the second in attendance after the English-speaking.  A very graphic illustration of our fellow countrymen‚Äôs knowledge. <br><br><h1>  That word </h1><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/786/1e8/39f/7861e839fd6e41daadbf9f3168b39e50.jpg"><br><br>  Surprisingly, an article about the <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%25A5%25D1%2583%25D0%25B9">word of three letters</a> <s>survives</s> exists on Wikipedia for about 12 years.  It is also surprising that it was already created two years after the opening of the Russian-language section.  Striking patience and endurance.  The article was and remains one of the most scandalous, they tried to remove it six times, but still did not reach it.  Its popularity for its entire progressive humanity, its hunger for knowledge, is evidenced by its popularity: it is one of the most frequently requested articles - in this parameter it is now in 1346 place among all Russian-language articles (there are 1,179,084). <br><br>  Congratulations to all on the birthday of this mastodon project, ‚ÄúWikipedia to help you‚Äù! </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/375507/">https://habr.com/ru/post/375507/</a></p>
