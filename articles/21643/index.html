  <section class="page js-page"><h1>How to use picollator.ru. What you should expect from him and what not?</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Finding the right information on the Internet is not so easy.  It would seem that search engines have long indexed everything and learned how to quickly detect newly emerging sites.  You can search not only pages, but also video, audio, etc.  (how, is another question). <br><a name="habracut"></a>  For especially patient people with an analytical mindset, they invented advanced features for constructing queries for search.  (I personally rarely use them, but, probably, someone no longer has a life without them).  Formulas for calculating the ratings of the relevance of results save us a lot of time on viewing the information found.  Also, for example, there are services that can be used to sing a song into the telephone receiver - and they will say exactly what the song was and let them listen to the original.  By the way, the service is innovative.  This is one of the few examples when the search is carried out not by a text phrase, but directly by digital ‚Äúcontent‚Äù.  Very funny, try if your company pays your phone bills.  By the way, let's try to find this service, for example, in Yahoo with the query ‚Äúservice to sing, find an audio site‚Äù.  And what do we see?  Baths and saunas in Moscow, the diary of Alexander Zhdanov ... And where is the necessary service? <br><br>  Searching for objects using keywords and phrases is a standard way to search the Internet.  Yes, you can optionally set filters by country, language, file type, or domain.  But a properly matched search query is the key to success.  The problem is that it is not always possible in principle to formulate a text query.  The only way is to use content as a request. <br>  When working with the information retrieval service for images on picollator.ru, this rule remains in force.  Instead of a text query, you need to pick up a request-image.  In other words, you need a fairly good photo of the person, information about which we want to find. <br>  What kind of photo should I submit to search for optimal results?  To begin with, look at the FAQ, published on the service website at <a href="http://www.picollator.ru/ru/faq">www.picollator.ru/ru/faq</a> and scroll the page to the question ‚ÄúAre there any requirements for uploaded photos?‚Äù.  Carefully read the answer: <br>  Image Type: TIFF, PNG, JPEG, BMP <br>  Resolution: no more than 25 megapixels <br>  Image size: 128 * 128 pixels or more. <br><br>  These are very important parameters.  If the image you upload for search does not meet any of the specified requirements, you will not find anything.  And from the requirements for the size of the image there is one important consequence - if the linear dimensions of the face in the photo are less than 128 * 128 pixels, you will not find it either.  Even if the photo itself is large enough, but the faces on it look like peas, then do not expect good results.

      <br>
      A perfect photo is a ‚Äúpassport photo‚Äù: <br>  1.Single tone background; <br>  2.Hair combed back (face does not overlap with other objects); <br>  3. Without glasses; <br>  4. Eyes looking forward (no turning and tilting of the head); <br>  5. Mimic is absent; <br>  6. Lighting uniform; <br>  7. The line connecting the eyes is horizontal; <br>  8. The face is completely placed on the photo. <br>  9. Size: 1200x900 pixels. <br>  10. Face size: at least 500x500 pixels. <br>  From these points, the user must make one main conclusion.  The eye area in the photo will be crucial to the search results. <br><br>  By the way, I want to make one important reservation.  Picollator.ru service does not save photos that you submit as a search request, and therefore does not use them in any way.  When you see a search result on your screen, your photo on the server is gone.  And therefore, if you want to use the same photo again as a request, you will have to upload it again.  At the same time, search results can change only if there were changes in the index during the search. <br><br>  The location of the face in the photo is very important.  Turn ready, raised or lowered chin, hair, combed on the forehead or back.  Nuances abound.  And if the person you are looking for is a woman who owns the art of makeup, then you can expect very different results depending on different photos.  About the effect of age on the face of a person and say no.  And how our mood can change our face!  Let's look at the following example.  We have 3 photos of one girl, try to find something in picollator.ru. <br><br>  In the first photo, the girl is exactly <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/olpictures/c92/ed6/fdc/c92ed6fdcd0676fa7b316f075a6438b1.jpg" width="450" height="349" hspace="10" vspace="10"><br><br>  Complicate the task and ask our model to tilt the head <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/olpictures/899/d80/595/899d80595b062d06661b21b73d4c8790.jpg" width="450" height="349" hspace="10" vspace="10"><br>  The results have changed significantly.  The main role here was played by a strand of hair that fell on the eyes. <br><br>  Now let's take a larger plan: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/olpictures/aff/eed/4fe/affeed4fe849d63abf6a1a685c96bea9.jpg" width="450" height="349" hspace="10" vspace="10"><br><br>  The results were quite different, although overlapping.  But this is all the same girl, shot at about the same time on the same camera with the same lighting!  We conclude that in order to get more objective results, it is advisable that you prepare several photos of the right person. <br><br>  What can we see in the results?  Picollator.ru is a fairly young service, and the volume of scanned and indexed data is still small.  Therefore, at this stage, it is likely that similar persons will be found, and they will be similar to your particular photo.  Polysemy of images is much higher than polysemy of words.  This must be understood and taken into account. <br><br>  The following important note concerns a proper understanding of the results that you see in front of you.  When you run a search for a keyword phrase, search engines return you results sorted by relevance with good enough (but not always!) Accuracy.  And you, most likely, got used to it for a long time.  When searching on picollator.com it is guaranteed that if there is already a photograph in the index, an exact copy of the one you are sending to the search, then you will get it first in the list of results.  But it must be an exact copy in all respects. <br><br>  How is the list of results formed?  To do this, read the FAQ answer to a question that, at first glance, has little relevance to our topic ‚ÄúHow does the‚Äú Find similar ‚Äùfunction work?‚Äù Answer: ‚ÄúWhen you click on the‚Äú Find similar ‚Äùlink under one of the photos, the search engine will show you similar images from the index.  When processing photos, clusters (groups) of images are created that are most similar to each other.  Thus, when you click on the "Find similar" button, you see the images that the system relates to the same cluster.  "For us, of particular interest is the phrase" When processing photos, clusters (groups) of images are created that are most similar to each other.  This means that similar images are collected in groups.  When searching, for a photo from the condition there are several of the most similar groups that are displayed in the results.  The fact that a group looks like some kind of photo means that the whole set of photos of this group is ‚Äúon average‚Äù similar to a given photo.  Therefore, the screen can be seen in the results of several similar persons, as well as a certain number of other less similar results.  Over time, these groups can be rebuilt and the results can improve.  100% result is not guaranteed by any search engine on the Internet, at least modern. <br><br>  In conclusion, I would say that Picollator Online is not a criminal investigation department.  He does not compare the left eye with the left eye, the nose with the nose, the ear with the ear.  The methods are somewhat different.  It also does not guarantee the exact identification of the person using the identikit, even if very skillfully composed.  But its results may well be useful to you as the system develops, because with the help of picollator you will be able to find pages on which collections of photos you need are posted. <br><br>  How to find the same service that ‚Äúby voice‚Äù on a phone call determines the melody?  The service is British and therefore knowledge of English is useful here.  Let it be the phrase "search service audio by phone".  Again did not work?  Then another Yahoo request for discovery engine music.  And please <a href="http://www.shazam.com/music/portal">www.shazam.com/music/portal</a> .  This is what a quality search query means. <habracut></habracut></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/21643/">https://habr.com/ru/post/21643/</a></p>
