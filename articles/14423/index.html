I bought the hard drive here last week - and so, yesterday it pounded, and after the reboot it was not even recognized.  Here is the warranty card, check.  I would like to change it. <br>  - Hello!  You came to the address!  We are now just not enough of such direct appeals from the field, which would allow to reveal the abscesses of the society that have ripened over the years!  It is high time to deal with this problem, identify the forces that oppose the establishment of order in this matter, and finally eliminate all those obstacles that prevent ordinary citizens of our country to freely express their will and improve their skills in modern technology. in the sphere ... <br>  - Uh-uh, I'm sorry ... I say, the screw would change ... <a name="habracut"></a><br>  - Of course!  Sure!  After all, we all understand that this item that you hold in your hands is not just a product of foreign industry, built on the unequal distribution of the world's technological and financial resources!  First of all, the current situation is an expression of enormous accumulated problems - both in our country and in the world as a whole!  Today ‚Ä¶ <br>  - Change today?  Fine! <br>  - I say, today the time has come when it is time to rethink numerous special cases of minor and seemingly minor problems, which in fact are systematic manifestations of the super-systemic properties of an integral system of values ‚Äã‚Äãthat have long discredited themselves on a global scale!  And it is especially critical in the current situation, when numerous manifestations ... <br>  - Stop!  Will you change the screw ?! <br>  - You can not see the forest for the trees!  It is this short-sighted behavior in the recent past that brought us to the very edge of the disastrous, I‚Äôm not afraid of this word, a catastrophic situation where decisions made to please a limited circle of people who do not take into account the real personalities of the management system ... <br>  - So, I understood, there is nothing to talk to you!  Where is your director here ?! <br>  - You can submit an application to the Commission on the Rights of Offended Investors, Unfinished Summer Residents and Unsatisfied Housekeepers on the visiting days of the Deputy Chairman of the Council of Assistants to the Office of the General Assembly of the Federal‚Ä¶ <br>  - NOT!  I do not want any statements, contributors, deliverers and other verifications!  Where is the director's office?!?! <br>  - Of course, I can take you to the Emergency Importance Department, closed beyond the limitation period ... <br>  - Yyyyyyy (turning counter-clockwise, swings the product of foreign industry ...) <br><br>  And here, quite accidentally walking towards the corporate premises of sanitary and hygienic purpose, which is under the operational control of the Chairman ... (well, in general, it doesn‚Äôt matter ... he went to the toilet shorter ...), the General Director of the Corporation, the Great and Mighty and simple and every, and every, and every. <br><br>  - Well, what have you got here (good-naturedly smiling firm 25-wadded smile with a light sly lamp Ilyich) <br>  - Here!  Screw burned out!  And he does not want to change! <br>  - Yeah, so you from the floor, comrade?  Very good!  (takes arm) That's just such direct communication, on a short, so to speak, leg with the very vertical of power, and are currently the most urgent, most important and impatient process in our system, which we should definitely and definitely support all - I repeat - at all levels of government!

      A curtain. <br><br>  Behind the doublet curtain there are blows on the floor of a product of foreign industry and the head of a limping representative of the local public. <br><br>  PS The author of this work is the new habra male <a href="http://geektimes.ru/users/dormy/" class="user_link">Dormy</a> .  He asked me to publish it, because  he himself could not add the topic even in ‚ÄúI am smart‚Äù (although it seems there can even be there with zero karma).  So if you like it - help him add a little more to the rights to Habr√©. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/14423/">https://habr.com/ru/post/14423/</a></p>
