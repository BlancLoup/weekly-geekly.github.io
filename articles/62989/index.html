  <section class="page js-page"><h1>How to promote stores in the regions</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Often I see a picture (by comments) that many users have opened their online stores or want to open their own online store.  Just dare to suggest that many habrovchan not live in Moscow, Kiev, St. Petersburg and other Internet-advanced cities, which use the standard methods of promotion of online stores.  Another assumption is that if the IT community is a community, then the future owners of the IT staff will not do a lot in marketing matters. <br><br>  Do not judge if you made a mistake in the conclusions, but I have a good intention to suggest the right way to start and continue to promote your store in the regions. <br><br>  Today I participated in an online seminar conducted by <a href="http://www.onlinesem.ru/">OnlineSem</a> .  Participation is free, I advise everyone.

      I liked the report by Alexey Radkevich from <a href="http://www.yalstudio.ru/">YALstudio</a> on website promotion in the regions.  For me, he was helpful.  And since a good topic has already turned up, and I have never written about promotion in the regions, then it is worth starting. <br><br>  An example was given for the Novosibirsk region.  I will describe my notes, comment on them and give general recommendations for any region on how to promote my store. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br><h5>  Where to advertise? <br></h5><br>  It is authentically known that promotion and advertising of a store in regions differs from promotion in capitals (actually for the CIS).  This is due to many factors, the main ones: the poor development of the main advertising sites, the low level of internetization in the regions, little experience of the inhabitants of the Internet in the regions. <br><br>  Most know, or at least guess, that it does not make sense to carry out seo-promotion for a regional store (if the share of your city in requests does not exceed at least 40%).  It is expensive, it will give a small effect due to the small share of requests (at least CIS), it is long (results no earlier than in 2-3 months). <br><br>  To accommodate in price-aggregators, too, not all work out.  Many do not have IP filtering to enable geo-targeting, like Yandex.Market. <br><br>  It is necessary to use other methods of advancement, or reduced standard ones. <br><br>  I use the following techniques in my work.  Alexey‚Äôs experience confirmed them and brought in fresh ideas: <br><br>  <b>1. Selection of thematic regional portals</b> <br><br>  Regional portals have a large audience, and in terms of geography target.  Of course, not every portal is suitable, but these are the only places where active Internet users in the region gather, which means a certain percentage of Central Asia for an online store. <br><br>  <b>2. Selection of thematic regional sites</b> <br><br>  This is if you're lucky.  Alexey said that almost all the major thematic resources in Novosibirsk are almost all automatics or real estate.  You are lucky if you find a large thematic resource for your product.  Small, too, is suitable - for bezrybe and cancer - fish. <br><br>  <b>3. Writing a large amount of content (Alexey‚Äôs experience)</b> <br><br>  We need not just content with a list of keywords, but also indicate the region in which the site is located.  This allows you to attract and HF + city and a lot of bass.  Alexey gave 600-800 requests, most of them are key. <br><br>  <b>4. Promotion search does not require large expenditures</b> , if it is calculated to affect only your region.  Links to increase the weight of the site, often do not need to buy, because  competition in the regions is low.  In the extreme case, Alexei gave this example: you can take free domains, put news engines on them and post news there with periodicity with links to the store. <br><br>  Another method suggested by Alexey is to register regional domains, such as sbp.ru, tomsk.ru, dp.ua, od.ua, and so on.  This will improve the issuance of the site in the search queries, in which there is the name of the region. <br><br><h4>  How to advertise? </h4><br><br>  <b>1. Context.</b>  Yandex.Direct allows you to target by region.  For Ukraine, where the main search is Google, the situation is more complicated, so you will have to use the names of the regions in your keywords. <br><br>  <b>2. And yet, price aggregators</b> , such as Yandex.Market, Mail.ru, Meta.ua, also have targeting.  Use targeting sites. <br><br>  <b>3. Banner and link ads</b> on regional portals.  Of course, banner advertising on the Internet has little use.  Nevertheless, there is no other option, and you still need to place a banner, at least a trial one, on the portal.  Links are placed in thematic sections of the site.  Contact the portal advertising manager, let him tell you what he has to offer. <br><br>  <b>4. Thematic resources.</b>  There is nothing to tell.  It is necessary to use to the full.  The only warning is that the slightest hints of advertising are very negatively perceived on such community resources. <br><br>  <b>5. Forums and subject branches</b> and even forum topics.  As an option, try to place a small banner with advertising in front of a branch or topic.  Another option is to constantly shine and give advice to the needy.  When you become familiar, they will ask for advice on where to buy and what you will advise.  Then advertise. <br><br>  <b>6. Offline advertising</b> .  Alexey shared his experience.  Valuable information.  Said stretch marks don't work.  But the distribution of papers in offices, in cars and on the street works very well.  The statistics resulted, from 10,000, about 1500 responded. Why such an effect?  Because in the regions it is still a novelty and not such indiscriminate spam as in the capital. <br><br><h4>  Nuances </h4><br><br>  <b>The first</b> .  If the visitor enters the keyword + city - this is almost 100% customer.  It is simply explained - the fact is that if a customer enters a city, then he wants to buy a particular product in a particular city.  In order to read the information about the product, you do not need to enter the city in the request. <br><br>  <b>The second</b> .  Portals and forums should regularly track reviews of the store.  The Internet community in the regions hangs out in the same places, more precisely, almost everyone visits the city portal.  Naturally, many portal visitors - potential customers will respond to a negative review. <br><br>  The task of the store management is to take non-negotiable measures to address negative reviews and stimulate positive ones. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/62989/">https://habr.com/ru/post/62989/</a></p>
