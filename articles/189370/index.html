And in particular, a step was taken to replace several of the switches with one central switch. <br>  We needed a switch that could collect all the traffic, and if possible not be worthwhile as a corporate model.  The choice fell on the Cisco SG500X. <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  With Cisco Catalyst switches there is probably every engineer working in the field of corporate computer networks.  ‚ÄúWorkhorse‚Äù type 2960 put dozens of pieces, connected in stacks, fed by PoE IP phones and other peripherals. <br>  I received it, took it out of the box, assigned an IP, hooked it to the control system, set it up once and forgot it.

      With small business models, less experience, at least for me.  They do not fall into the cheap segment, but the functions are interesting. <br><br>  For the specific case of the switch was needed <br>  - 10G Ethernet connectivity <br>  - the ability to connect conventional 1G Ethernet links, <br>  - network segmentation into VLANs (for traffic photo, for IP video surveillance cameras, for access control systems and automation). <br>  The 10G links are needed for workstations where photo processing takes place, and for the server - photo archive storage. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/83e/d25/976/83ed259769e1b921833a9644f1f1da8c.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  In the selected switch model, there are 24 regular gigabit ports under RJ45 plus 4 ports per 10G for SFP + modules.  And another 2 5G ports for stacking switches.  According to the documentation, the ports for the stack can be used for normal connections, but in reality this has not yet been verified. <br>  The price of the switch is around 40 thousand.  rubles retail.  Not a little, but for the existing functionality is acceptable. <br><br>  From the previous 10G system, the transceiver for the multimodal optics was removed from the server, and placed in the switch.  And the server and another workstation were connected to the switch by twinax with a 10GBase-CU SFP + cable. <br>  Guaranteed working length of such cables is up to 5m.  All that is further is through transceivers to optics. <br>  Twinax cables from Cisco are quite expensive.  5 meters sold in Moscow for 5-6 thousand rubles.  It was possible to order for $ 20-30 via ebay, but decided not to risk it, since there was a negative experience. <br><br>  And then - everything was simple. <br>  The switch was turned on, booted in a couple of minutes, received an address from DHCP on the router, after the first login through the web interface, the password was changed, the fixed IP was set, the mode was changed from Stack to Standalone - and the basic setting can be considered complete.  Yes, more Jumbo Frames have been included. <br>  By default, this model works in L3 mode. <br>  And it works.  Even 50 dollar Chinese 10G multi-mode optical transceivers have been got. <br><br>  From a performance point of view, no noticeable changes in the exchange rate between the server and workstations were found.  Even running on the server and slave.  NTttcp test utility station to test the speed of 10G interfaces could not load the switch CPU noticeably anyway. <br><br>  All other settings VLANov and other delights will be later.  There is nothing unusual about them.  Again, there will be an excuse to read the 550 pager manual for the administrator. <br><br>  Of the deficiencies found - in some cases, the web interface responds, scrolls quite slowly.  Moreover, the built-in cooling fan makes a lot of noise.  In my case, louder than the server with the main disk array.  In the living room is not put :-) <br><br>  And I made one conclusion for myself - network equipment manufacturers recognized that 10Gbit is needed in a small business.  They have something to download, there is a demand for such equipment, which was confirmed by this project. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/189370/">https://habr.com/ru/post/189370/</a></p>
