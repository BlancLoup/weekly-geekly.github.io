It is reported that the incident took place between June 14 and 18, 2018, and penetration was discovered on June 19.  The attackers compromised the undisclosed number of Reddit employees and infiltrated into ‚Äúseveral systems‚Äù by gaining access to the data. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/12a/978/54b/12a97854b53534447956b621d35293c3.jpg" alt="image"><br>  <i>Illustration from <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/aug/02/reddit-user-information-usernames-passwords-email-addresses-hack">theguardian.com</a></i>

      Representatives of Reddit officially recognized the fact of hacking and outlined the essence of what happened in <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/93qnm5/we_had_a_security_incident_heres_what_you_need_to/">his blog</a> : <br><blockquote>  On June 19, we learned that a hacker had compromised several Reddit accounts with access to the cloud and source code, intercepting two-factor authentication verification codes that came via SMS </blockquote><blockquote>  We cooperate with law enforcement agencies, do the necessary to eliminate the consequences of the current situation, and also try to do everything to avoid similar incidents in the future.  Only a small number of users were affected, which we have already managed to notify. <br></blockquote><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  Hackers got in particular to the backup database, dated May 2007.  Reddit was founded and earned in 2005, and this backup database contained all the information for the site‚Äôs two years of operation, including all of its content and user messages (including personal ones), as well as hashed passwords and salts for hashes . <br><br>  Representatives of the company claim that the criminals did not get access to write to the compromised servers, and therefore could not modify any important data.  Nevertheless, the developers still increased security (in particular, changed the API keys) and monitoring. <br><br>  Also, hackers are lucky to get to more recent email digests sent between June 3 and June 17, 2018.  These collections of recommended posts for portal readers contain information about user names and associated email addresses. <br><br><h4>  SMS based two factor authentication failure </h4><br>  Reddit uses plain SMS-based two-factor authentication to protect its employee accounts by requiring the input of a one-time access code along with a username and password. <br><br>  However, according to Reddit, hackers intercepted these text messages <br><br>  Keith Graham, Chief Technical <i>Officer of SecureAuth + Core Security</i> , commented on the situation for <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/aug/02/reddit-user-information-usernames-passwords-email-addresses-hack">the Guardian</a> : ‚ÄúAlthough SMS-based authentication is popular and much more secure than just a password, it‚Äôs widely known that it‚Äôs quite vulnerable to intruders who her gaps have already cracked many celebrities. <br><br>  Graham explained that cybercriminals are able to access the phone number to which the two-factor code is sent. SMS: phone. <br><br>  "This is the information that is widely available on the darknet due to previous database leaks, such as Equifax." <br><br><h4>  Effects </h4><br>  Some questions are caused by the fact that if the security incident was discovered on June 19, 2018, it was only publicly reported on August 1, 2018, i.e.  more than a month later.  Another interesting point, in the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/93qnm5/we_had_a_security_incident_heres_what_you_need_to/e3f6k9k/">comments</a> to the news about the incident, resource administrators said that "they <b>hired</b> their very <b>first security chief</b> , and he started work just <b>2.5 months ago</b> ." <br><br>  At the moment, compromised user accounts are still valid, but letters have been sent to their owners with instructions for changing the password. <br><br>  In addition, reddit administrators have introduced advanced two-factor authentication to access confidential data.  Reddit users are advised to reset and set a strong unique password and set up login confirmation using the code generated by the application, and not via SMS. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/419047/">https://habr.com/ru/post/419047/</a></p>
