  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Great service for downloading files</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  <strong>Prehistory</strong> <br><br>  A year ago, when the glorious student days were already coming to an end, another student quest appeared in front of me.  One respectable professor, who enjoys unquestioned prestige in our department, was ready to play the role of my diploma supervisor, which practically guaranteed me a free transfer of my diploma.  The task was that in return, the professor wanted to get the latest version of one well-known and very expensive mathematical package.  An additional complication was the need for a Linux version. <br><br>  Because of such difficulties, it was not immediately possible to find the necessary distribution kit, and only on one Chinese server.  I was even ready to download these 4 gigabytes, pay for traffic from my own pocket, and without worrying about writing a diploma ... but, as it turned out, the server gave the files very slowly, constantly tearing the connection, and, unfortunately, did not support the resume ( it was good at least that the distribution was broken into pieces). <br>  And here, in fact, begins the useful part of the story. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  <strong>Story.</strong> 
      <br>
        <script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>
        <ins class="adsbygoogle"
          style="display:block; text-align:center;"
          data-ad-layout="in-article"
          data-ad-format="fluid"
          data-ad-client="ca-pub-6974184241884155"
          data-ad-slot="8945601208"></ins>
        <script>
          (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
        </script>
      <br>
      After several days of torment and many megabytes of dead traffic, one kind comrade led me to the <a href="http://getfirelink.net/">getfirelink.net</a> service.  A week later the distribution kit was presented to the professor, and some time later I was already celebrating an excellent diploma defense. <br><br>  So what is a service that helped me out a year ago and is still in effect?  Everything is very simple: the service downloads files from almost any source, and sends them to you in any convenient way.  Free, and, most importantly - very quickly and reliably.  In short, a sort of intermediate buffer, which can be used for a variety of purposes. <br><br>  <strong>So can he?</strong> <br><br>  The most obvious is to download files.  And not only by direct links from http / ftp, but also from many popular file sharing sites.  Rapida, ayfolder ... yes, all popular file hosting are supported with a bang.  Moreover, you can also merge videos from YouTube / Rutube and other popular services of a similar direction.  It is possible to merge entirely, and in parts, specifying the necessary pieces.  You can specify a proxy through which the jump should be carried out.  You can substitute cookies.  You can substitute the referrer.  Beauty! <br><br>  Downloaded files are on the server for some time (now it is a little more than five days), after which they are deleted.  This was done deliberately - in order to avoid storage charges.  The downloaded good is available through direct links - however, you cannot use the service as a file hosting service (there is a technical possibility, but the developers honestly warn you that this is not good, as it discredits the service and may lead to its closure). <br><br>  But this is not the most delicious.  In addition to the described possibility of ‚Äúbuffering‚Äù files from slow and unstable servers, GFL can also serve as a perpetual source of free traffic.  The service contains many tools designed to outsmart various limiting tools. <br>  Merged files can be sent to any FTP.  And you can send by mail - and after all, unlike any Internet access, no employer covers the mail, and does not impose limits on traffic.  Previously, many providers had a common practice of free access to their own mailboxes - in this case, a freebie comes to the house ... <br>  You can specify any "sender" of the letter, which completely solves the problem of bypassing corporate spam filters.  Files can be broken into pieces and sent in several letters, which allows you to bypass the limit on the size of the letter, if it is, of course.  And if incoming emails are checked for a long time by the antivirus on the server, GFL offers the means to ‚Äúhide‚Äù the attachment. <br><br>  <strong>Service restrictions.</strong> <br><br>  Admit it, did you think that writing looks too good to be true?  No, this is all true.  GFL really works very fast, and since its inception is free.  Without imposing virtually any serious restrictions on ‚Äúfree‚Äù users, GFL offers for some very reasonable money to get some additional features.  Here are some of them: <br>  Additional space for downloading large files (the maximum amount of space - 5 GB, the maximum size of the downloaded file - 2 GB).  For free accounts, 100 MB is initially allocated, however, for each day of presence on the server, the limit is increased by 5 MB.  Accordingly, for each ‚Äúmissed‚Äù day, 5 MB is removed, but less than the original 100 MB does not fall.  Remarkably, large files can be downloaded even with the minimum size of the place - piece by piece.  In combination with the ability to send already downloaded files to GMail, problems with lack of space cease to be so. <br>  Higher priority jumps.  Server resources are still limited, so all downloads are performed in turn.  However, I can say that for the whole period of using a free account I have never noticed at least some significant delay - a maximum of five minutes, which is quite acceptable in any situation. <br>  Batch file download.  Just an increase in convenience - instead of adding files to the queue one by one, you can specify a list of links that will be processed by the service. <br><br>  Well, and other small buns, which can be found on the site itself. <br>  Once again, I note that there are no fundamental differences in the use of paid and free accounts, just for the money you can ensure additional comfort. <br><br>  <strong>Conclusion</strong> <br><br>  Of course, the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãsuch services is not new, many have used them, as they say, since ancient times.  But such an excellent implementation (and such conditions), as on <a href="http://getfirelink.net/">getfirelink.net,</a> I have not met anywhere else.  The GFL is distinguished from other analogues by the extreme simplicity, convenience and responsiveness of the administration - more than once saw how some necessary chip, demanded by visitors, was implemented in the shortest possible time.  Service is constantly being improved and improved, for which many thanks to its creators. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/19700/">https://habr.com/ru/post/19700/</a></p>
