Shopping without borders</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  In July, one of the world leaders in the field of payments and money transfers via the Internet, PayPal, published the results of a study of international purchases made on the Internet in the report of the <a href="https://www.paypalobjects.com/webstatic/mktg/pdf/PayPal_ModernSpiceRoutes_Report.pdf">Modern Spice Routes.</a>  <a href="https://www.paypalobjects.com/webstatic/mktg/pdf/PayPal_ModernSpiceRoutes_Report.pdf">The Cultural Impact and Economic Opportunity of Cross-Border Shopping</a> .  We got acquainted with the results of the research, translated several fragments of the published report, and presented the most interesting facts in the form of infographics in the new issue of Runet in Pictures.  This time it is devoted to international shopping, and how actively Russians are involved in it. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/2f9/e23/269/2f9e23269804585ad0f5a26c822b2a65.png" alt="image"><br><br>  Continuing infographics and translation of excerpts from the report, read under the cut.

not just through traditional marketing.</i>  <i>The shelves of the stores in which we make purchases have become almost endless, and not only in terms of physical size.</i>  <i>We pay for purchases not only with cash or credit cards, but also with the use of many mobile devices that define our new digital lifestyle.</i>  <i>But this is only the beginning.</i>  <i>With regard to commercial relations, attention should be paid not to ‚Äúhow‚Äù, but to ‚Äúwhere.‚Äù</i> <i><br><br></i>  <i>This has happened before.</i>  <i>In the era of the Great Geographical Discoveries, researchers pushed the boundaries of the known world and opened up entirely new trade markets.</i>  <i>The great trade routes connecting East and West were of far greater importance than just the exchange of exotic goods.</i>  <i>It can be said that these trade routes were the first social networks through which ideas were spread about everything from culture to economics.</i> <i><br><br></i>  <i>In this report, you will be able to trace the nascent contours of the modern ‚Äúgreat trade routes‚Äù.</i>  <i>Participants in distant markets linked by digital platforms are becoming part of global trade relations that were previously unimaginable.</i>  <i>Some consumers in global trade are attracted by the possibility of saving - they are looking for well-known products in markets that are known for their low prices.</i>  <i>But this is only part of the story.</i>  <i>Buyers who have received information about certain products and are inspired to purchase them by ‚Äúlocal‚Äù marketing are embarking on a global hunt for unique products and authentic brands.</i> <i><br><br></i>  <i>The emergence of modern "great trade routes" is not accidental.</i>  <i>It was triggered by the merging of the most modern and operational technologies, the growing number of budget smartphones in developing countries, the increased reliability of the online trading infrastructure and the emergence of increasingly simple and secure ways to pay for purchases.</i>  <i>But the main reason for the emergence of global trade routes on the Internet was trust between participants in trade transactions, between complete strangers from different parts of the world.</i>  <i>And here a dialogue is born between representatives of different cultures and nationalities, which had no analogue before - we could not even imagine it.</i> <br><br>  <b>PayPal talked about the study:</b> <br><br>  <i>PayPal instructed Nielsen to conduct a survey of customers buying online on overseas and focus on six key global markets: the United States, the United Kingdom, Germany, Brazil, China, and Australia.</i>  <i>Experts investigated the behavior and interviewed more than 6,000 online shoppers over the age of 18 who made purchases over the Internet over the past year.</i>  <i>In addition, the study was conducted among companies doing business on the Internet and selling their goods to foreign buyers - the researchers tried to learn the secrets of their trading success from them.</i> <br><br>  <b>What did the study show?</b> <br><br>  <i>In the course of the study, 94 million buyers who bought goods from foreign online stores were identified in six thoroughly studied markets.</i>  <i>In total, they will spend this year 105 billion USD, which will be 16% of the total turnover of the e-commerce market.</i>  <i>By 2018, 130 million people will be making purchases abroad via the Internet, and they will spend up to 307 billion USD annually outside the domestic markets.</i> <i><br><br></i>  <i>The survey revealed both similarities and differences in the culture of concluding international trade transactions in different countries.</i> <i><br><br></i>  <i>Clothing, shoes and accessories are the largest category of online goods that are bought over the Internet abroad.</i>  <i>Only Brazilian buyers were able to reverse the trend, giving the "palm" of computer technology.</i>  <i>Unlike consumers from any other countries, Australians give greater importance to free shipping, even at a loss to quality and range when it comes to making purchases over the Internet in other countries.</i> <i><br><br></i>  <i>The study revealed five types of customers who were able to overcome geographical and cultural barriers to obtain all the advantages of international trade: Fearless Adventurers, Researchers-Rationalists, Great Travelers, Searchers-Reinsurers and Bargainers ".</i>  <i>Contrary to popular belief, ‚Äúbargain hunters‚Äù, who seek to buy abroad to save, form only 10% of the turnover of international online commerce, although they account for almost a quarter of the number of international buyers.</i>  <i>Meanwhile, Fearless Adventurers, who hunt foreign online stores for unique products and are constantly looking for new online stores, are more expensive than gold.</i>  <i>Despite the fact that they are only 13%, they create 30% of the international turnover of online commerce.</i> <br><br>  PS We will be happy to comment, as well as ideas and suggestions - what would you like to see in the next issues of ‚ÄúRunet in Pictures‚Äù. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/190290/">https://habr.com/ru/post/190290/</a></p>
