  <section class="page js-page"><h1>How to make money on eBay: which gives the status of PowerSeller</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  As you know, <a href="http://ebay.com/">eBay</a> is the largest commercial site on the Internet.  Here you can put up for sale any product (almost any) and find a buyer.  It has its own payment system <a href="http://www.paypal.com/">PayPal</a> , as well as a well-thought-out rating system that minimizes the likelihood of fraud on the part of the seller or buyer. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Unfortunately, for citizens of the CIS, working at an eBay auction is complicated by the fact that residents of these countries have almost no opportunity to register with PayPal.  It remains only to observe from the side and envy foreign merchants who successfully trade on eBay.  The site has all the conditions for their work. <br><br>  On eBay, a reward system for experienced (professional) vendors works.  This program is called PowerSeller and has several levels.  To get the lowest level (bronze), the seller must demonstrate an average monthly level of sales of at least $ 1000 for three months.  At the same time, the overall rating of reviews should reach 100, and at least 98% of them should be positive. <br><br>  Followed by a bronze silver level (selling $ 3,000 per month) and gold ($ 10,000).  But they all seem ridiculous compared to the two highest levels of the PowerSeller program: platinum ($ 25,000 per month) and titanium ($ 150,000).

      The quality of customer feedback is critical to the seller.  If even a few negative ones appear, then the status of the seller is threatened. <br><br>  The eBay company keeps in secret how many sellers in the trading system have the status of platinum or titanium PowerSeller.  According to independent researchers, among the multi-million dollar audience of sellers, only about 4% achieved at least some status.  However, titanium status owners actually exist in nature.  Some of them <a href="http://www.newsfactor.com/story.xhtml%3Fstory_id%3D44134">became known to</a> journalists of NewsFactor. <br><br>  28-year-old David Wirtenberg (David Wirtenberg) has his own auction office, and sells some of the goods on eBay.  He became interested in online auctions in 2003, being in the status of unemployed.  His stepfather offered to sell jewelry on eBay.  The business went well, and after three months, David received titanium status and began to recruit additional staff to his company.  Of course, such a rapid success would be impossible without a solid start-up capital. <br><br>  Another example of a successful businessman who has already received PowerSeller status is Mike Shelton.  While working at a professional golfing supplies store, he got the idea to help his employer sell off excess goods.  It went so well that Mike soon registered his own company, which helped many other retail stores solve this problem.  In less than a year, the turnover of his company has already exceeded $ 5 million. <br><br>  All examples of successful business on eBay show that this platform is very convenient for beginner merchants.  It does not require large funds to start a business.  On the other hand, a lonely entrepreneur is very difficult to become a millionaire.  He simply can not cope with the processing of a large volume of orders. <br><br>  However, entrepreneurs who work on eBay at a loss are much more common.  In fact, it is not easy to calculate future profits, taking into account all the specific costs of online trading.  Entrepreneurs work a lot, have a large turnover, and end their careers with bankruptcy.  By the way, for this reason, buyers can find so many lucrative deals on eBay. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/4128/">https://habr.com/ru/post/4128/</a></p>
