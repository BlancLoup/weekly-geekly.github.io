Even if there is a fancy DSLR, you always need a light (this 356 grams) camera, which will not take up much space and at the same time guarantees good shots.  The camera, in fact, was created for typical ‚Äútourist‚Äù loads: it calmly refers to frost down to minus 10, drops from a height of up to 2 m and even takes pictures at a depth of 15 m and gives good pictures at night.

But just as interesting.  Therefore, the best "double gift" - SLR cameras.  First, it is a more painful way not to think about what to present for the next holiday.  In your arsenal now there are dozens of lenses, blends, filters, flashes, tripods, wardrobe trunks ... In general, there will be enough years for 5 years, and then there is time for a new SLR if fanaticism takes root.  And he is instilled, tested!  Secondly, you can buy, for example, Nikon, the Canon for her, and arrange battles from the category of eternal themes.  Which is cooler?  We both like it.

The shutter speed range from 30 to 1/4000 sec will allow you to shoot even fast moving objects.  The device is good for difficult conditions and custom settings.  But even the most lazy person will like it due to the luxurious color rendition characteristic of Nikon, and a variety of ready-made shooting modes (sometimes they are very helpful!). <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/06f/f77/ce9/06ff77ce9cccaaab2dc5d2b449d0fff0.jpg"></div><br>  Camera <a href="http://www.mvideo.ru/products/fotoapparat-zerkalnyi-canon-eos-100d-ef-s-18-55-is-stm-sumka-stella-mccartney-10009825%3Futm_source%3Dgt%26utm_medium%3Dcpm%26utm_campaign%3Dgtblog%26reff%3Dgt_cpm_gtblog">Canon EOS 100D</a> - the legendary entry-level SLR, made in white.
