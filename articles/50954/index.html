What will be here?  About how the installation of conventional analog PBX (although not necessarily only analog). <br><br>  For a start, I would like to note that not IP-telephony, but ordinary analog telephony will be considered here.  Although IP-telephony and strides by leaps and bounds, and I fully agree that it is the future.  But all the same, the vast majority of office workers (especially in the regions) sit on analog phones.  Especially in many modern PBXs there are gateways to IP telephony. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a>

      A bit of terminology (It‚Äôs not quite the same as everywhere else (and in standards in particular, but unfortunately they taught me that in due time, please don‚Äôt beat me very much :)) <br>  <strong>Point</strong> - the final device - telephone, fax, modem.  In general, the outlet where you can plug something. <br>  <strong>Cross</strong> - in one of the directories on telephony "Telephone cross in general is a distribution switching system for private branch exchanges.". <br>  <strong>Interfloor cross</strong> - in fact, is intermediate between the main (which is directly connected to the PBX) and end points. <br>  <strong>Skirting</strong> - ‚Äúthey serve for the solderless connection of the cross wires and for this purpose they are equipped with contacts that can be of several types: primarily openable and non-disconnectable.‚Äù The most common for small and medium-sized offices are Krone and 110. <br>  <strong>TZ</strong> - technical task :) <br><br>  Some tool. <br>  <strong>Cold head and clean hands</strong> - about clean hands is not a metaphor at all, especially when laying over a false ceiling, colorful <strong>handprints</strong> on the ceiling do not impress the customer. <strong>Crimping</strong> is not strange, but it may not be necessary. <strong>Assembly tools for embedding and cutting wires</strong> - in popular speech called blocking, plintovshchik and a couple more titles.  It is used to seal the wires in plinths and sockets.  It happens different types, it is best to take two, one under 110/66 the other under Krone. <br>  <strong>A stepladder</strong> - very often a <strong>puncher</strong> is useful - to create holes in the walls, sometimes used to create holes in the floors (ceilings). <br>  <strong>Detector wiring</strong> - unfortunately in Russia, there is such a specificity, as wiring is laid absolutely under unthinkable angles, absolutely in impossible places.  So before drilling you should definitely check the wall. <br>  <strong>Tester</strong> - we use testers from Fluke <br>  We also need a screwdriver (cross, flat, small and large), side cutters, nippers, pliers.  Well, we must remember that it is better to take the extra than to run at the right moment and look for a hammer (for example) <br>  Another very useful thing in such things (and not only) is a walkie-talkie.  We use Icom F-26 radios in the LPD range.  Communication is sufficient for our needs. <br><br>  <strong>Consumables</strong> <br>  The cable is the most diverse (depending on installation).  Most often divided by the number of pairs and street / indoor <br>  Jackie - 6P4C (RJ-11), 8P8C (RJ-45) <br>  Rosettes, keystones - a variety of variations. <br>  Skirtings - 110, Krone. <br>  Cable channels, trays, if used, then alabaster or putty :) <br>  Patch panels, amphenols (TELCO) <br><br>  It is written on behalf of a person who, as far as possible, is trying to manage a small IT-dealing company that is additionally involved in laying local networks, telephony and other similar things, that is, from mine.  Of course, not everything is done according to the SCS standards, although the efforts are closer to the ideal. <br><br>  Suppose you install a PBX (or do not do it, but they asked you to help with it, or just want to do it :), and if you don‚Äôt want at least read it).  The first thing that needs to be learned from the client is the number of internal telephones needed, the number of external lines.  IMHO - these are the main parameters.  Then we find out which room (or building, or complex of buildings).  We begin to ask the client about the additional functions it needs. <br><br>  <em>From personal experience: Often people do not even know what they need or what they can do.</em>  <em>For example, not many people know the advantages (and some of the existence) of a system telephone, the DISA function (auto secretary), an intercom controlled from a telephone (which is actually a telephone, only a little differently programmed), conference and speakerphone, and many, many more .</em>  <em>I also ask the client about the need for IP-telephony, it is better to ask - ‚ÄúDo you make long distance calls?‚Äù, It will be clearer to him.</em> <br><br>  After specifying the details, we ask the client to prepare a floor plan (very desirable for construction), print it out and go to the client.  Now it is necessary to go through (one of those who will do the installation must do it) with the client around the building and mark on the map where the phones will be.  Also find out where the ATC will be installed, explaining that a separate room is needed or can be combined with the server room.  Pay attention to the walls, ceiling (mounted or not), baseboards, In general, what you need for installation. <br>  <em>From personal experience: Exactly the place for the phones themselves is often not indicated (it just shows up on the table and it‚Äôs necessary to say here!), You can start from common sense - so that the wire to the phone is less noticeable and certainly not confused under your feet.</em> <br><br>  After inspection and preparation of the plan, TK is being developed.  It must contain a list of the necessary connection points for end users (with a plan for connecting them), cable routes, necessary functionality, and deadlines. <br><br>  At the same time we make an estimate - cables, connectors, panels, skirtings, PBXs with expansion cards (or without), crossboxes, and so.  Personally, I use the Experts SKS program for work (do not consider it PR, I just haven‚Äôt seen such programs of this level anymore).  And quite often it turns out that the cost of one installation can exceed the cost of an automatic telephone exchange by 10‚Äì15 times. <br>  <em>From personal experience: the average cost per point was about $ 30 (only telephony).</em>  <em>Apart from exotic options, when everything is in one room (although there are enough problems here) or vice versa there are 5 points, but each is in different houses (and it happens)</em> <br><br>  If the customer signs the TK.  That conclude a contract for the supply and installation.  If you don‚Äôt necessarily need to find out what doesn‚Äôt suit you, if there are some technical issues (it happens even when the client is not special, but you need to build everyone), then you should try to communicate to justify your decision.  If the price of the question does not suit you, again you can try to explain that there are wholesale prices, you make a surcharge (I usually talk about 10%) and sell, well, or pick up something in the lower price range (remove some functions, reduce the number of lines). <br><br>  <em>From personal experience: One time a customer who bought a PBX got about 100 numbers.</em>  <em>After drawing up the TK, and then the estimate, he refused to cooperate with us.</em>  <em>The wording - ‚ÄúWe buy from you a PBX for 50,000 rubles, and you think we‚Äôre installing another 200,000 thousand, you should run all the cables to us for free‚Äù.</em>  <em>Unfortunately, to explain to the client that he was not quite right did not work out and we broke up.</em>  <em>Until now, it is interesting, he put himself PBX or not.</em> <br><br>  Once all questions are settled, you can invoice for payment.  All changes in the TZ now will be decided at the level of directors.  With explanations that the compilation and TZ, and budget documentation also cost money. <br><br>  Further, the technical assignment is given to the head of the installation team for painting.  Now he will know how and what should be done by installers. <br><br>  After payment: <br><br>  Begins proper installation. <br><br>  It is done approximately in such a sequence - <br><br>  1.Montazhniki pass around the office, looking closely :) <br>  2. A puncher is drilled and holes are drilled in all the proper places (at least this point should be done with fewer people) <br>  3. Then cable channels, trays, etc. are laid (with the expectation that it is possible to cram 2 times more cables than it should be according to plan) <br>  4. The main and floor cross are installed (sometimes the floor cross is just a cross-box) <br>  (the division is conditional, because sometimes it‚Äôs found that there are 8 people on 3 floors, and to allocate a separate cross for each floor, though by standards, but sometimes a common one is made for everyone. It also happens that a call-center on a certain floor, and in this case there may be several cross-overs) <br>  5. Main lines are laid.  Label each cable, at the ends, and at each level of the transition.  Lines are usually laid with a 20% margin on the capacity of the lines. <br>  6. From the floor cross-country we scatter cables around the cabinets (points).  Do not forget to label. <br>  7. Then 1-2 people pass through the points and install the sockets.  Why not immediately?  And that would not carry with a bunch of different tools. <br>  8. After this goes cross.  Everything is recorded (and almost on video). <br>  9. Then PBX is connected and programmed.  There are already methods, programs and complexity depending on its brand. <br>  10. Double run over all points, we call.  We check the programmed things so that everything works as it should. <br>  11. The next item is the signing of the ‚ÄúAct of the executed works‚Äù.  Exchange of documents, stamps and signatures. <br>  12.PROFFIT !!! <br><br>  In the next article I will tell you about the practical installation and initial programming of the Panasonic TDA-100 PBX.  Constructive criticism, your wishes and suggestions are taken into account :). </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/50954/">https://habr.com/ru/post/50954/</a></p>
