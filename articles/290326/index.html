His story to us about how the search for a new living space took place provoked the appearance of this article. <br><br>  We all know that finding suitable square meters is far from the simplest occupation, which often takes up all our time.  The market is saturated with offers, but when it comes to such "large" acquisitions as living space (especially for ourselves or our family), we become particularly picky.  Gathering to buy an apartment, we will monitor the market 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.  And, of course, we will not call on all offers in order.  We will bookmark something, write something on the phone, after all, there are many options.  After all, we have to accumulate in the head a certain number of suitable objects, compare them with each other, and then start dialing.

      This is where we may face trouble.  You can get in after hours.  And if it says: ‚ÄúHurry up, there are only 5 apartments left!‚Äù Or ‚ÄúUntil the end of the sentence 5 hours!‚Äù  Suddenly this is exactly what we need?  Many potential buyers rightly believe (given the price of the transaction) that you can try to call during off-hours ... <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Against the background of the above, we decided to conduct an experiment and call the real estate company after the end of their working day. <br><br>  Where did we get the phone numbers? <br><br>  It is not a secret for anyone that accommodation on the subject of real estate is very expensive.  For those who do not remember or do not know our target request: ‚Äúto buy an apartment in Moscow‚Äù in the direct, according to Yandex, a click on an ad with such a key will cost from 300 to 900 rubles.  We took the first 40 companies out of issue ....  These were very large companies whose names you probably heard. <br><br>  How many companies do you think have talked with us?  No, not an answering machine, namely, a living employee. <br><br>  Of the 40 companies we called, we were answered only by ...  6!  Of the remaining 34, only 2 companies called back later!  Thus, only 20% of the customers who have phoned us processed the appeals and tried to contact the potential buyer. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/f2e/1a7/d6b/f2e1a7d6b4e64e6d893f47caa06e9b4f.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Of the 6 companies that answered us, 3 were forwarded to the manager, and in three other cases the call was transferred to the contact center, where they recorded our contact details and gave advice. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/800/ae1/c0f/800ae1c0fbe14260a95c90059971fd27.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Of the 36 cases when we were not answered, an answering machine was turned on in 25 companies (76%), we faithfully left our contacts, and only twice called us back.  Thus, 92% of telephone companies do not even listen to voicemail.  In 14% of cases, when we were not connected to the operators during off-hours, the call went to the mobile.  After the redirection, 60% of companies were happy to talk to us. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/ff7/8e8/ecb/ff78e8ecbc0c414a9c3a6a10450ad224.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  What conclusions can be drawn?  Every seller, no matter what his product, boas or apartments, seeks to meet with his buyer.  And for these purposes it uses any means, including advertising, for which the seller pays.  But in the end, the buyer must call ... Yes, customers are different, persistent, intrusive, boring and not very compliant with the rules ... Yes, the sellers are also people, they should have personal time after work. <br><br>  But!  There are options here: <br><br><ol><li>  To conclude an agreement with the call center so that calls outside the working hours come to the operator and the client can resolve the issue with which he is calling so urgently. </li><li>  Hire a person who will specifically answer calls when employees do not answer the phone. </li><li>  Record all calls that came after the end of or before the start of work, and then call back to all numbers during business hours. </li><li>  Assign the "attendant" during off-hours and forward calls to him. </li><li>  Or connect a virtual PBX and bring telephony to automatism. </li></ol><br><br>  To cope with any of this task will help the <a href="http://ringcloud.ru/tarif.php">virtual PBX RingCloud</a> , the functionality of which will help to track calls, make call forwarding, connect with customers and make the right choice of operator, depending on the issue on which the buyer is calling. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/290326/">https://habr.com/ru/post/290326/</a></p>
