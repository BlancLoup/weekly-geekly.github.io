  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Reflections on microblogging</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  This article is the fruit of my thoughts about what is so good microblogging, and how its benefits can now be used in their projects. <br><br>  First I want to talk about Twitter.  Someone scolds him, someone praises, but the main thing - very, very many use it.  And you asked yourself the question, what is the secret of Twitter popularity? <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h4>  About Twitter </h4><br>  In fact, it is close enough to LJ - the same blog posting, same friends (or followers).  But: <br>  1) <b>Twitter does not make the user think.</b>  The user who comes to LiveJournal often does not know what to write to him.  LJ is trying to deal with this problem with the help of prompts - pre-prepared questions that the user can only answer.  Twitter also removed all unnecessary, leaving one simple question: <i>"What are you doing now?"</i> .  Tell me, will you think hard if you are asked what are you doing now?  Most likely no.  At a minimum, it is immediately clear that you are sitting at the computer and reading this topic =) And writing about it is not a problem at all) <br>  That is why Twitter has increased the attitude of writing users to readers compared to LJ.  As far as I know, in LJ 1% writes, 3% comment, the rest only read.  On Twitter, they write much more, because  he realizes the most important human need for communication, and allows you to communicate without thinking. <br><br>  2) <b>Twitter has increased posting usability to the limit</b> .  The fact that in LJ is done by 2-5 clicks, on Twitter is done by one.

      3) <b>Twitter immediately closely integrated with mobile services.</b>  A mobile device with their pace of development - the most important trend. <br><br><h4>  How to use these benefits? </h4><br>  So, looking at the rapid growth of Twitter and inspired by the example of VKontakte, on the Russian market they created several complete Twitter clones and a few more incomplete ones (I counted 9 in total).  And at the same time, Twitter is coming to Russia with leaps and bounds.  Do clones have a future?  Those who managed to reach an audience definitely have some future.  But freshly created clones want to bite off a piece from the clogged market.  Is it worth fighting and spending a lot of budgets for this thing? <br><br>  The very idea of ‚Äã‚Äãmicroblogging is beautiful, it's silly to refuse it just like that.  I propose to use it in the framework of thematic projects in order to give its users a <i>tool for easy communication with a minimum of words</i> .  I want to share my experience in implementing this idea. <br><br>  We recently opened our service - <a href="http://joyreactor.ru/">joyreactor.ru</a> .  Functionally, this is a service that combines the advantages of microblogging and imageboards.  Clients can write about how they are doing and what's new, and also attach interesting pictures to them. <br>  JoyReactor is a thematic service, there is a growing IT community living there, the purpose of which is communication and entertainment. <br><br>  A little bit about the project analytics: <br>  1) A good number of page views for 1 user - 7-20 per visit. <br>  2) High user activity (recently 5 people wrote 300 comments in 3 hours). <br>  3) The duration of stay on the site for one visit is 11 minutes. <br>  4) The community has grown 2 times in a month (without ads). <br>  5) 22% - "word of mouth" (this is when users throw links to friends on IM). <br>  6) The bounce rate is 22% (the user scanned 1 page and immediately left). <br><br>  This is how the thematic microblogging behaved in my hands.  On the experience of the Reactor, it became clear that microblogging is convenient to use: <br>  1) on thematic sites for easy communication in the community. <br>  2) for the development and bug tracking blog (an example is our development blog <a href="http://joyreactor.ru/dev">joyreactor.ru/dev</a> ). <br><br><h4>  Our microblogging engine </h4><br>  Initially, the site engine on which JoyReactor is written is positioned as open source. <br>  If there is a desire to embed microblogging on your website or make your own microblogging service, the instructions are here: <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/open_source/59330/">habrahabr.ru/blogs/open_source/59330</a> We will help with advice =) <br>  Since the announcement of the alpha version of the engine, we fixed a bunch of bugs, and added new features.  Most recently, at the request of users, they made a posting via Jabber. <br>  I am very glad that examples of sites built on our engine have already appeared) </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/63180/">https://habr.com/ru/post/63180/</a></p>
