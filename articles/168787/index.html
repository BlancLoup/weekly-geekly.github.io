And this phenomenon is hardly unique only to man - in varying degrees, signs of laziness are shown by all living beings.  And in general, this is a rather natural process - no predator being fed will go hunting, so a person does not want to do work until he is pressed by some kind of deadline.  This is not surprising, procrastination, in my opinion - the natural trait of any person. <br><br>  But a person lives in a society that does not care about the plans of nature and in order to live a normal life - it‚Äôs not enough to work in fragments in order to cover only the minimum expenses.  We need to work steadily, daily and in proportion to the expected profit, as well as our growing needs. <a name="habracut"></a>

    <h4>  What to do? </h4><br>  For a long time I was interested in the question - how to learn to control myself?  Why did I still work beyond the norm last month, and today I am stretching the project with burning deadlines?  In general, why does the work go or is it worth it?  You can try different GTD-techniques, all Eucharov tricks: "divide the tasks", "do one important thing first", "motivate yourself with a golden yacht on the desktop wallpaper" and so on.  And yes, you can get a certain positive effect from this.  But it was not enough for me, I expected more productivity from myself. <br><br>  Then I went further - every time when I was distracted from work during the working day, I wrote down what I was doing instead of work.  Approximately 70% was surfing in the network \ reading something, 15% - computer games and another 15% had to communicate in the messenger. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/317/34d/953/31734d95344aa7867dd4ca53b5d30078.jpg"><br><br><h4>  How to motivate yourself to do work? </h4><br>  - This is a typical question that arises in all in such a situation.  But <b>this is the wrong question</b> . <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/272/d7b/657/272d7b657f64e0ca4810656fbaff1409.jpg"><br>  It is much more important to find out what makes us do secondary activities and use it. <br><br>  What is usually motivated to work?  What is advised? <br><br>  <b>1. Money.</b>  Does anyone here pay for reading entertainment sites?  Or for playing solitaire?  We reject this motivator. <br><br>  <b>2. Long-term goals.</b>  ‚ÄúDetermine the purpose of your life and always remember that you are working to achieve it, put a photo of your dream on the refrigerator ... imagine the future result ...‚Äù etc.  etc.  It is clear that among us there are few manko, whose goal in life is hemorrhoids from endless surfing on the net. <br><br>  <b>3. Music.</b>  "Pick up music that will create a positive attitude ...".  I think to watch cats in social.  networks - music to anything. <br><br>  4. Read success stories, 5. Quotes from Steve Jobs, 6. Do exercises, 7 ... enough <br><br>  <s>Bullshit!</s>  Nonsense is all. <br>  There are a lot of tips and ways of motivation, we will not list everything, but it is already quite clear that what motivates us to do something is a completely different power.  Which one?  - this is the right question. <br><br><h4>  Progress engine </h4><br>  This is not about advertising, as someone might suddenly think, but about something else, very close.  As an example, I will take computer games as the brightest of all.  Because we play games, we don‚Äôt pay money, we don‚Äôt have global goals related to games, and we don‚Äôt need to gather strength to play anything.  However, we are happy to change our highly paid job by digging for Minecraft, grinding the demons from Diablo, or even growing virtual potatoes.  What motivates us to play?  <b>The answer is simple - we are interested</b> .  And here we come to the answer to the most important question: What to do? <br><br>  If you can‚Äôt work and don‚Äôt want to do anything at all, but just go to bed, then you are overworked and it‚Äôs not about procrastination.  Rest. <br><br>  If you can‚Äôt force yourself to work, but at the same time you read the websites, play games or communicate, it means <b>you are not interested in working</b> .  And the only thing that can make you return to your duties is interest (well, or the threat of dismissal :) <br><br>  And why did you think gamification became so popular?  Although it is only the tip of the iceberg. <br><br><h4>  The working process </h4><br>  However, it's not about the games.  And although gamification has a positive effect on employee productivity, this is just one of the ways to increase interest in work.  And on interesting things, if you are not tired, you will always find time and energy. <br><br>  And it's not the choice of work, although many authors argue that if you are tormented by procrastination, then you are said to be busy, not your business, look for your purpose in something else.  Others believe that there are interesting projects and not interesting ones.  Accordingly, the first you perform easily and quickly, and the second, unpleasant to you - you put off and pull.  But the main thing is not what you do.  <b>The main thing is the work process.</b> <br><br>  Someone may have been fantasizing that he had in vain chosen the IT industry, that it was boring and depressing here and that if he were, for example, a person who is engaged in the creation of movies, he would have been burning with work and full of interest.  Not here it was!  It would be necessary to get to the studio, where dull workflows, a harmful director, endless edits, etc.  etc.  In general, everything is the same. <br><br>  Whatever you do, come up with a fantasy to your business - you can make it much brighter and more positive than the routine shooting of pixel enemies or reading entertainment sites.  Your interest in work (and not at all on the work itself), and as a result your productivity, depends on the way your workflow is built, communication with the team, management / customer.  You must, in spite of everything, build your processes so that they are fascinating, regardless of what tasks you are facing.  So that between entertainment and work you can choose work without violence against yourself. <br><br>  <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/168849/">The second part of</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/168787/">https://habr.com/ru/post/168787/</a></p>
