      The project <a href="http://deeep.me/">Deeep.me</a> is a service designed to answer user questions in accordance with its tastes.  The reaction of the public turned out to be ambiguous: ‚ÄúI like your project.  The only comment is a claim to globalization and universal coverage.  As far as I suppose, this means multi-million dollar investments.  Will you have enough money to implement all these ideas in full? ‚ÄùPerhaps, with the help of Wanted.VC, the authors will find the right tools. <br><br>  In addition to the mass of pleasant features, which you already know, social networks have one more that you probably suspect, but you do not dare to voice.  Social networks help you build and maintain the image that you want to present to others, or rather those who have been added as friends.  The creators of Deeep.me understood everything very correctly.  Therefore, the basis of the project, most of all similar to a social network, is the question ‚Äúwhat are you?‚Äù, And not ‚Äúwho are you?‚Äù.  We will have to answer it in a roundabout way: we do not like it directly.  <a href="http://wanted.vc/blog/deeepm/">+++</a> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/87f442fa/40c755c6/bc6309c1/494dfb0d.jpg"><br><br><br>  Before our eyes, photo albums turned from puffy books with large pages into web pages with small squares of thumbnails.  ‚ÄúShow photos‚Äù means giving a link to an online album.  Most likely, it lies in one of the social networks. <br><br>  And most likely, your grandmother, who crossed three times before clicking on the ‚Äúaccept call‚Äù button on Skype, is not registered on this social network.  And she really does not want to.  <a href="http://wanted.vc/blog/ordinary-miracle/">+++</a> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/43257e1c/50d23084/d2c70081/44926b8f.png"><br><br>  The <a href="http://gate-32.ru/">Gate-32</a> project became the winner in the <a href="http://gate-32.ru/news/787795/">XI All-Russian Open Competition ‚ÄúGolden Site‚Äù</a> in the ‚ÄúTourism and Leisure‚Äù nomination, and also became the second in the ‚ÄúInnovations, Services and Technologies‚Äù nomination, having lost only to the Mail.Ru portal.  Wanted.VC could not pass by. <br><br><br>  Unlike most projects that appear on Wanted.VC, which offer to solve quite specific tasks, the Gate-32 project is designed to help with the usual problem itself: to help you spend your holidays with minimal nerve resources. <br>  Everything that was once done in travel agencies is now happening on the site: you also choose the direction, duration of stay and hotel.  Communicate your data and choose the method of delivery of documents - you can send them to e-mail, by courier home or on the day of departure directly to the airport.  Then pay for the selected tour - also, of course, online.  <a href="http://gate-32.ru/">+++</a> <br><br><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/5a9e3ed6/8a00dd4b/940388b7/34c77749.png"><br><br>  <a href="http://ru-ru.facebook.com/TipMeet%3Fid%3D360669056775%26amp%3Bv%3Dapp_6261817190%26amp%3Bs%3D20">‚ÄúAwesome app !!!</a>  <a href="http://ru-ru.facebook.com/TipMeet%3Fid%3D360669056775%26amp%3Bv%3Dapp_6261817190%26amp%3Bs%3D20">Hope this will spread through FB and become a standard, ‚Äùthe</a> <a href="http://www.tipmeet.com/">Tipmeet</a> project <a href="http://www.tipmeet.com/">comments</a> on Facebook like this.  The remaining comments are more concise: these are just five stars, the user rating of the project. <br><br>  We all learned little by little, and now we are trying to prove that learning is not so important, it is much more important to master some kind of ‚Äúcommunication skills‚Äù, learn English and learn to do a hundred things at once. <br>  All right, but become this maxim universal law, chaos would reign very soon.  Because it is specialists who are involved in jurisprudence, linguistics, finance, and finally medicine.  And it is precisely the qualified specialists who will always be in demand. <br>  The authors of <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.tipmeet.com/">Tipmeet</a> are probably one of those who have repeatedly faced the problem of a shortage of specialists.  Therefore, the service created by them is designed specifically for those who have special knowledge and desire to share them.  Of course, for the appropriate qualification payment.  <a href="http://wanted.vc/blog/banal-scholarship/">+++</a> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/f22a438f/2da6b1e7/b207f266/7b41bccd.png"><br><br>  There are a lot of comments from users in the discussion of the ‚ÄúGeoplaner‚Äù project - difficulties in working with GoogleMaps, difficulties in determining the location, etc.  You can read them <a href="https://market.android.com/details%3Fid%3Dcom.hippoapp.alarmlocation">here</a> , and in the comments to this post - express your own thoughts. <br><br>  A good amount of your memory is given to keeping small reminders in it: turn off the sound before a lecture or a performance, remember to pay the rent, buy food for the cat, send sms to the mother that everything is fine, and so on. People with especially strong memory prefer to put reminders on your mobile. <br><br>  It works, but with a certain degree of probability: often after pressing the ‚ÄúOK‚Äù button, the reminder just flies out of my head, because the time for its implementation has not yet come.  <a href="https://market.android.com/details%3Fid%3Dcom.hippoapp.alarmlocation">Geoplaner</a> developers solved this problem differently: reminders are now attached not to time, but to place.  <a href="http://wanted.vc/blog/remember-all/">+++</a> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/84cb9fac/88a8a450/f7b3aea1/62771577.png"><br><br>  <a href="http://startuppoint.ru/blog/public/35497.html">‚ÄúIt‚Äôs cool that in the description of Maidarin our project was taken as a starting point)) but I think it‚Äôs better not to focus on us but on groups, all the same we have a narrower specialization - shopping, and not everything in a row!</a>  <a href="http://startuppoint.ru/blog/public/35497.html">&lt;...&gt; it is also not clear how they are going to open representative offices for as much as 12 cities, it may be enough to open it, but I‚Äôd like to develop vryatli))) in any case, I wish the guys from Maidarin good luck).</a>  Wanted.VC joins the wishes and draws your attention to the fact that the author's spelling and punctuation is tremblingly preserved by us. <br><br>  Recently, we <a rel="nofollow" href="http://wanted.vc/blog/products-for-vip-coupons/">talked</a> about the site <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.viptalon.ru/">VIPtalon</a> .  The essence of it, we recall, was reduced to the fact that you were given the opportunity, having bought one of the coupons offered on the site, to get a discount in the corresponding store. <br><br>  The <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.mydarin.ru/">Maidarin</a> service, which will be discussed today, works the same way as VIPtalon.  True, unlike the latter, "Maidarin" provides you with your own decision on what you want to get a discount.  <a href="http://wanted.vc/blog/the-whole-world/">+++</a> <br><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/238845ec/1a87e1b2/52fdfb93/97aa18e0.jpg"><br><br>  - Dumb, I SPEAK WHAT IT WAS!  DO YOU UNDERSTAND HOW DO I ALREADY TALK?  I, because of you, can heal the health, I can break the voice! <br><br>  - Uh-uh ... Please change the tone of communication, otherwise we will have to stop our conversation ... <br>  - THAT YOU CHANGE THE RESPECT OF THE CUSTOMER'S COMMUNICATION, UNDERSTAND C ***?  ANSWER TO MY QUESTION POSTED! <br>  - I have already answered your question several times ... <br>  The contrast between the icy calmness of a tech support employee of a well-known company and the rageful unrest of his interlocutor made an 18-minute recording of their dialogue the main hit of the RuNet for several days. <br>  The fact that on the Internet sometimes there are irresponsible people, it was approximately clear.  But the question is different: how professional was the operator who drove the client to the frenzy of such emotions?  This question should be of primary interest to the managers of a well-known company - after all, they are committed to solving the problems of their clients. <br>  The creators of MoodCenter think so.  <a href="http://wanted.vc/blog/calumet/">+++</a> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/14b092e2/32590281/d7d07d1a/beac0865.jpg"><br><br>  Let's do a test.  Say out loud two abbreviations: OSAGO and KASKO.  If your teeth / nape ache unpleasantly, your left palm nervously combed the word, if your body reacts to these letters extremely ambiguously, most likely you belong to the ‚Äúmotorists‚Äù subculture. <br><br>  <a rel="nofollow" href="http://carcorner.ru/">CarCorner was</a> invented in order to minimize unpleasant reactions of the body to the designated abbreviations, and at the same time to all other procedures associated with the heavy burden of car lovers.  <a href="http://wanted.vc/blog/online-garage/">+++</a> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/e4f3d914/2b6c86c5/79725946/6960fbc7.jpg"><br><br>  After the publication of the post about the "Program Catalog" we received a letter from an investor who wished to give money to the project team for its further development.  Contact the authors of the project were issued along with the blessing.  We stocked up on popcorn and watch what happens next. <br><br>  It is known for certain that the total lack of understanding of the phrase ‚Äúpaid software‚Äù is a characteristic feature of the Russian mentality.  That the long years of communism at the genetic level have atrophied the understanding of private property. <br>  And other, other.  All this, of course, has little to do with reality.  You can look for reasons in the social and anthropological sphere, but most likely everything is much simpler: there are no conditions for the user to buy software with less power than having downloaded it for free in Google. <br>  Meanwhile, a short list of domestic online software stores, inculcating the culture of "their own", was supplemented with another name - <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.programcatalog.ru/">"Program Catalog".</a>  The authors of the project tried to explain Wanted.VC, than they are better than their colleagues.  <a href="http://wanted.vc/blog/download-fee/">+++</a> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/1668aebb/882f3285/de737450/6c6cbe5a.png"><br><br><br>  <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.xn--d1acsmafh.xn--p1ai/">‚ÄúDeloPRO‚Äù</a> is a rare case when you can talk about a project right away in numbers and dates. <br>  The idea of ‚Äã‚Äãthe system appeared back in 2006. The task in brief sounded like this: ‚ÄúTo create a system for supporting management decisions based on the analysis and processing of the organization‚Äôs document flow‚Äù. <br>  A year later, the first software was developed.  The basic module of the system was registered in 2008, then the first sales began.  By January 1, 2011, the authors of the DeloPRO project earned 800,000 p.  on the sale of software licenses in the corporate configuration.  <a href="http://wanted.vc/blog/systems-approach/">+++</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/123865/">https://habr.com/ru/post/123865/</a></p>
