His project is mainly devoted to Steve Jobs in the period 1986-2000, but gradually the work went beyond the scope of one person and a series of photos turned into a chronicle of computer technology. <br>  I did not plan to write an article when I went to the exhibition, because you can <a href="http://www.be-in.ru/events/6170-menuez/">read</a> about it and <a href="http://www.afisha.ru/exhibition/photo/75108/">see</a> about it, but after it the <s>world turned upside down</s> I was amazed at the story told by the photographer so much that I decided to retell it to the community.  The project consists of 50 photographs with annotations that Dag Menyuz himself wrote.  Traffic ~ 3Mb and a lot of text. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h4>  Fearless Genius: The Digital Revolution in Silicon Valley 1985-2000 </h4><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/ef3/ba4/16f/ef3ba416f0f854bc79307a40dbbc49c5.jpg" alt="image"><br><h5>  Doug menuez </h5><br>  For fifteen years, I have documented the work of a mysterious tribe of people ‚Äî engineers, businessmen, and venture capitalists of Silicon Valley.  Before my eyes, technology was being created that not only changed our behavior and our culture, but made us think again about what it means to be human. <br>  This project started in 1985, when Steve Jobs was forced to leave Apple and he began his long journey back - the path of trial and error, trying to create a supercomputer for educational purposes.  Steve was the epitome of sensitive looseness inherent in that time.  Hippie with a sophisticated design taste, he combined the idealistic vision of the world with the ambition of the previous generation, aimed at conquering space.  I wanted to understand how the process of innovation is born, and thought that by photographing Steve, through his personality I would be able to grasp the very spirit of Silicon Valley.  And I asked him for unlimited access, I wanted to be wherever he or his team would be.  Steve agreed without hesitation.  After three years, my project has expanded;  I earned the trust and received personal access to each of the major innovators of the time and more than seventy companies.  With many, this relationship continued for many years.  Working during the birth and heyday of the Internet and the dotcom boom of the 90s, I shot about 250,000 shots. <br>  In 2004, the Stanford University Library acquired my archive.  To date, approximately 7,000 negatives have already been scanned, from which the photographs presented here were selected.  After I retouched the files, they were transferred to digital negatives, from which images on silver gelatin paper were manually printed. <br><h6>  Dag Menyuz, February 2012, New York </h6><br><hr><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/aa5/fe7/e11/aa5fe7e11b4021755fbb8cd48ee85156.jpg" alt="Steve Jobs"><br><h6>  Steve Jobs is preparing a response.  Palo Alto, CA, 1986 </h6><br>  NeXT Computer Art Director Eddie Lee said that in a state of rabies Steve could curse smiling.  When Steve was upset about something, he hung his head down, and his face was distorted by a nasty grin - and you always knew that you would be blown away.  The picture shows Steve with just such a warning grin during a conversation with one of the first Macintosh engineers.  Eddie also said that if Steve approached you with his head held high and a smile on his face, it meant that you were just gold, and everything was in order with the world. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/73a/ca1/785/73aca1785680f87e53bf866949b5203f.jpg" alt="image"><br><h6>  Susan Ker - part of your daily life.  NeXT Computer, Palo Alto, California, 1986 </h6> <br>  Susan Ker created icon designs for Macintosh, Windows, IBM OS2, and many other operating systems.  Her work has influenced the daily lives of hundreds of millions of people around the world.  In the picture, she goes through the new NeXT Computer office in Palo Alto (they hire new employees and retool empty spaces).  She was part of the first Macintosh team at Apple - there she created the famous icons.  Leaving Apple with Steve after his overthrow, she became co-founder and creative director of NeXT Computer, where she revised the design of the icon and logo while working with legendary designer Paul Rand.

Sonoma, California 1986 </h6><br>  At a working meeting at the Sonoma resort, Steve Jobs describes the work scheme for his team.  He explains what is left to convert from analog to digital format.  Of course, everything in the world - photos, movies, music.  What has not yet become digital will soon become, as the digital revolution is spreading further and further. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/295/2e5/43f/2952e543fc47439f2aa80cf8215f6651.jpg" alt="image"><br><h6>  The day Ross Perot gave Steve Jobs $ 20 million Fremont, California, 1986 </h6><br>  After this lunch with members of the board of directors of NeXT, held at the site of the future factory, Ross Perot invested $ 20 million in the company.  Even then, Steve was an unsurpassed showman who knew the power of persuasion.  The invention of cool new technologies required investors like Perot - and speaker skills were needed.  Ross succumbed.  But then he said that this was his greatest mistake. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/e10/d6c/45b/e10d6c45be27b287b64877a8ce23636b.jpg" alt="image"><br><h6>  Steve Jobs in thought.  Santa Cruz, California 1987 </h6><br>  Steve had the artist's intuition: he was able to come up with new ways of combining existing technologies so that something completely new would come out.  Here he reflects on the solution of a technical problem, which was discussed at a remote meeting of the company.  One of the qualities that distinguished Steve favorably was his refusal to take the word ‚Äúno‚Äù as an answer.  Common sense said that what Steve wanted to do was impossible.  He surrounded himself with the most brilliant scientists who were smarter than him.  But he collected them to change the world, no less, and did not particularly care about what advanced science considered impracticable.  About one of his representatives said that he "spits his teeth" - he was so angry that Steve did not listen to reality.  But Steve created his own reality.  He led his resisting geniuses to meet the future, walking over their heads and driving people crazy until they somehow created the miracle that Steve demanded of them. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/1fd/6a7/64c/1fd6a764c5371af58a2b02d03fcbcd1a.jpg" alt="Steve Jobs"><br><h6>  Steve Jobs inspects a prototype computer case NeXT.  Santa Cruz, California.  1987 </h6><br>  Steve Jobs is tormented by the texture of the surface of a NeXT computer case made from anodized cast magnesium.  Magnesium is a lightweight and durable material, but complications in the manufacture of the hull designed by Steve led to an increase in cost.  Most know about Steve's perfectionism - and here he would not argue.  Most of his workflow was tied to trust.  Innovation is incredibly difficult: not only in the process of creating a product, but also its release to the market.  Most do not succeed.  Steve was merciless to his team, because he understood the stakes and knew that each of the thousands of decisions could bring him closer to success or failure.  He had to believe that the person proposing the solution did his homework carefully ‚Äî before he could influence the circumstances.  It meant twenty minutes of heart-rending cry.  It could be offensive, but all participants also thought that it was a fair price to be part of a team that would change the world. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/3a8/6e0/25b/3a86e025ba1813a1eabc53f74eeb71d3.jpg" alt="image"><br><h6>  Steve Jobe returns from a staff picnic.  Highway to Santa Cruz, California 1987 </h6><br>  Although Steve could be incredibly rude, critical and even vengeful, most of the time he was cheerful, smiling infectiously and beaming with incredible energy.  However, I didn‚Äôt watch as many moments of unbridled fun, like this one: Steve at the wheel of a rented old school bus returns from a picnic to the company of his employees. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/0aa/2d7/162/0aa2d716284e63efa3dfa5293fc634ae.jpg" alt="Steve Jobs"><br><h6>  Steve Jobs gathers troops.  Redwood City, California 1988 </h6><br>  Steve delivers an encouraging speech to employees shortly before the launch of NeXT Computer, bursting with a tirade about revenge against Apple and John Sculley.  After three years of exhausting, almost superhuman preparatory work with his small team, the return of Steve Jobs seemed brilliant.  But it was not quite like that.  The launch had a big advertising success, but its key partners in the field of education felt deceived by the high cost of the NeXT workstation.  The company slowly disappeared when Steve closed the NeXT hardware workshop in 1993 during another painful public failure.  He almost completely distributed his money between NeXT and Pixar and was close to bankruptcy.  Years of struggle stretched more than a decade.  But the NeXT software was far ahead of its competitors, and in 1996 Apple bought its operating system.  He got a seat on the board of directors and soon returned to Apple‚Äôs leadership.  He launched one successful product after another, while Pixar produced hits one by one.  The sale of the film company made him a billionaire.  Apple has become the most expensive company in the world.  After more than a decade of frustration and failure, Steve Jobs made the greatest return in business history. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/0b0/db6/9ce/0b0db69ce13f722432f72e811048928b.jpg" alt="image"><br><h6>  The first NeXT computer in the office of Steve Jobs Redwood City.  California 1988 </h6><br>  Shortly before the official launch of NeXT computers, Steve already had a prototype assembled: a computer, a monitor, a printer, and peripherals.  In the picture they are covered with black velvet.  There was extremely high competition among technology companies, so precautions were followed even behind closed doors. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/e6e/9e3/951/e6e9e39513bdea593374861a039ff078.jpg" alt="image"><br><h6>  Waiting for Steve Davies Symphony Hall San Francisco.  California.  1988 </h6><br>  Fans and journalists are waiting for hours to get into the Davies Symphony Hall in San Francisco for the presentation of the NeXT computer.  Steve Jobs came on the scene and for three hours talked about a new powerful computer for education.  The overall reaction was extremely positive: dozens of magazines placed Steve on their covers, heralding his return to the industry.  But his main educational clients, who were promised an affordable computer, were outraged at the price of $ 10,000. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/898/721/824/8987218241ab2389f6d13c6180b22953.jpg" alt="image"><br><h6>  Kiss.  San Francisco, CA 1988 </h6><br>  A pair of passionate employees having fun at an annual Adobe party.  Shortly after the party, they got married ... and divorced a few years later. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/935/b8f/558/935b8f55809b8e088707fe768ea7a5cf.jpg" alt="image"><br><h6>  The founders of Adobe Systems are preparing to launch Photoshop.  Mountain View, CA, 1988 </h6><br>  John Warnock and Charles Geschke (left) are absolutely ready to launch Photoshop, another significant program they have created that will completely change the concept of photography and graphics.  Both left the Xerox Pack in order to establish Adobe in 1982.  After thousands of hours of programming, they created PostScript ‚Äî software that links a computer to a printer ‚Äî thereby making the greatest printing achievement ever since Guttenberg invented the printing press in 1436.  However, their initial business plan did not include the licensing of this software.  Steve Jobs, during his visit in the early 1980s, convinced the founders to license Apple software to use it on Macintosh computers with the new LaserWriter printer.  Steve also immediately bought 19% of the company and paid in advance for the license, making Adobe the first Silicon Valley company in history to become profitable in the first year of its existence.  No company has since repeated this feat. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/b56/3a4/a0c/b563a4a0ccc47179c739d0b52dd57211.jpg" alt="image"><br><h6>  San Francisco, CA, 1988 </h6><br>  An Adobe Systems employee happily yells when they make a toast to a wonderful past year.  The New Year's party was organized on a huge jetty in San Francisco and was reportedly worth millions of dollars.  As Silicon Valley grew in the 1980s, and progress progressed, parties began to compete with Las Vegas. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/a59/db2/ef9/a59db2ef913cd720947f9e26ff055fef.jpg" alt="image"><br><h6>  Engineers at Beckmann Instruments.  Fullerton, CA, 1989 </h6><br>  A pair of distinguished engineers in the building of Beckmann Instruments - the main competitor of Hewlett Packard.  With handles in breast pockets and slide rule, they represent the image of the classic nerds.  In fact, they are the pioneers of mathematics, the heroes of the Second World War and the space technology race, as well as the Atlanteans who built Silicon Valley.  The generation of Steve Jobs - the generation of hippie clever people who brought with them a relaxed and rebellious spirit along with new ideas - violated the status quo.  They abandoned the insert for pens in a breast pocket, ties, rules and regulations, turned the cautious culture of engineers upside down.  Nowadays, there are not enough qualified engineers to fill all the jobs in Silicon Valley. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/53d/ed8/e0a/53ded8e0a3dd6bdfd0dbafa99c6abe01.jpg" alt="image"><br><h6>  Portrait of Russell Brown in a fancy dress.  Mountain View, CA, 1989 </h6><br>  Publicly defending Photoshop in the early stages of development, Russell Brown said that this program is just as simple a hammer as a tool to build a house, or to blow it into pieces.  Many photographers and graphic designers have resisted digital technology just as most people usually resist change.  Photoshop has become a truly destructive digital technology that hastened the death of film.  But at first it was not so obvious.  Russell Brown deserves more than others for his victory over the creative community thanks to his lectures and master classes on Photoshop. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/da6/36e/66b/da636e66b48ee55346bbee394bd82692.jpg" alt="image"><br><h6>  Employees at the computer LAM Sunnyvale, California, 1990 </h6><br>  Engineers are working to solve the problem of electrical connection in the assembly of a machine that tests LAM chips - this is part of a whole sub-industry that has grown around processing equipment and testing computer chips. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/e87/29b/c0b/e8729bc0b22b2c18bdab247a1f08ced5.jpg" alt="image"><br><h6>  Artist David Hockney rests between lessons on Photoshop.  Mountain View, CA, 1990 </h6><br>  As digital technology became increasingly powerful, Silicon Valley began to resemble the Paris of the 1920s.  Artists and artists ready for experiments came to the Valley from all over the world.  The first were musicians, like Peter Gabriel and Herbie Hancock.  George Lucas, Francis Coppola became the pioneers of the Valley, along with many others.  The cultural ground changed: the avant-garde company gathered to put forward new ideas.  The picture shows British artist David Hockney with one of his favorite dachshunds learning the first version of Photoshop at a Russell Brown seminar. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/aec/d92/57c/aecd9257c5347736c2239f7a459bfc5a.jpg" alt="image"><br><h6>  Personal conflict during the meeting of investors San Mateo.  California 1990 </h6><br>  Despite all the achievements of the women's rights movement, Silicon Valley remained predominantly white men‚Äôs territories. During a break in a tense meeting of investors, the manager aggressively defended her opinion in a dispute with a female employee. evaluation. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/ef6/3b2/cd6/ef63b2cd60eba3f494a07eaee79eb394.jpg" alt="image"><br><h6>  John Scully struggles with shyness before meeting with the press.  Fremont, California 1990 </h6><br>  Apple CEO John Sculley overcame shyness and stuttering, becoming a great speaker, and welcomed the press at the Apple plant in Fremont.  Steve Jobs convinced John to leave Pepsi and join Apple in 1983.  Steve challenged John by asking if he wanted to sell sweet water for the rest of his days or change the world.  After he made Steve go, John increased Apple's revenues from $ 800 million to $ 8 billion a year, but was not accepted in Silicon Valley - as the person who fired Steve, and as a layman in new technologies.  At the peak of his power, in February 1993, he sat next to Hillary Clinton on national television and watched the first address of President Bill Clinton ‚ÄúOn the situation of the country‚Äù.  But even then, John knew that despite the external well-being, Apple was stumped, unable to rewrite the operating system and innovate.  Profit and market share fell rapidly.  His attempt to save Apple using the Newton tablet was made too late. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/cf5/6ff/d51/cf56ffd51bbfc4db5d38f58b836fc7d3.jpg" alt="image"><br><h6>  Sale.

Cupertino, California 1991 </h6><br>  A calm morning meeting where the members of the Apple Newton team look rested, calm, fresh and organized.  About a year later, the team will come to a standstill, it will get tired and will in a hurry try to fulfill the set unrealistic deadlines.  One member of the team will already be dead, another will be hospitalized, and on the horizon there will be technical problems that will be intractable. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/242/861/161/2428611614e190ee823092c34637a5c8.jpg" alt="Boy and girl"><br><h6>  Sex for wise men.  Adobe Systems, Mountain View, California, 1991 </h6><br>  The guy and the girl play a sexy scene, depicting an electrical outlet and plug at the Adobe New Year's party.  Technical workers are known for their inability to communicate and often shyness, especially male engineers.  Role-playing games were very popular, and any idea of ‚Äã‚Äãcostume parties was welcomed.  Similar was happening in high school.  This couple repeated the scene throughout the office to the delight of colleagues. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/f9f/3fe/5ab/f9f3fe5ab9e5fc0936f3e9b0e6076aea.jpg" alt="image"><br><h6>  Anxiety fills the room.  Emiraville, California 1991 </h6><br>  For fifteen years, during which I filmed Silicon Valley, competitive pressure and the desire to bring all new products to the market intensified every year.  During the evening on the occasion of the expansion of the company, employees discuss the upcoming deadline for the preparation of the product presentation at the industrial exhibition. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/13f/08b/526/13f08b526eebbeddeec1da18190d53a8.jpg" alt="image"><br><h6>  Investors.  Fairmont Hotel, San Francisco, California, 1992 </h6><br>  At a high-tech investment conference at a San Francisco hotel (far away from the foul-smelling start-ups of Silicon Valley), venture capital firms make deals.  The digital revolution would not have happened without experienced investors taking tremendous risks for the sake of the ideas and talents of young entrepreneurs.  In 1975, the total investment in all projects in Silicon Valley was only $ 10 million.  By the time this picture was taken, this amount had already reached $ 10 billion and continued to increase.  By 2000, it had grown to 112 billion. And then everything collapsed. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/8aa/bf2/12e/8aabf212ec80bb35cd38aa14a4e73622.jpg" alt="image"><br><h6>  Disappointment.
