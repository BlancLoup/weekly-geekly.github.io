      After that, the US Department of Defense decided to eliminate by all means the emerging theoretical danger of a nuclear threat from the Soviet Union, by combining all of its research projects into a single structure.  The idea was to connect all existing computers that were currently in the US into one network, through which scientists from different universities could share their thoughts and results.  This network was called <b>ARPANET</b> , it is the progenitor of all networks and the Internet.  ARPANET <i>(Advanced Research Projects Agency Network)</i> - computer network, agency for promising research and development. <a name="habracut"></a><br><br><img src="http://img-fotki.yandex.ru/get/6441/86212109.2/0_a0fc4_a43dfda4_M.jpg" alt="image"><br>  <i>Korolev S.P.</i>  <i>founder of practical cosmonautics.</i> <br><br>  <b>At the beginning of the creation of the Internet were:</b> <br>  1. Soviet scientists who created the artificial satellite of the Earth: <b>Korolev, SP, Keldysh, MV</b> <br>  2. The US Department of Defense, which decided that it was necessary to catch up and overtake the USSR. <br>  3. The United States Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency <b>(DARPA)</b> , which put forward the idea that we need a computer network. <br><br>  The development of a computer network was assigned to four American universities: <br>  1. University of California (Los Angeles). <br>  2. Stanford Research Center. <br>  3. University of Utah. <br>  4. University of California (Santa Barbara). <br><br><img src="http://img-fotki.yandex.ru/get/4115/86212109.2/0_a0fc1_4df06519_M.jpg" alt="image"><br>  <i>Larry Roberts 1970</i> <br><br>  <i>October 29, 1969,</i> for the first time, a connection was established between the two computers of the universities of Los Angeles and Stanford, the word <b>LOGIN was</b> transferred from one computer to another.  <b>Charlie Kline</b> (passed the word) and <b>Bill Duvall</b> (took the word) participated in this landmark event, <b>Larry Roberts</b> took part as an observer - the first developer of the fundamental specifications for the ARPANET network (by the way Roberts is still on horseback, for example in 2010 introduced to the public a new data distribution technology "streaming router").  After successfully connecting two computers to the network, computers from other universities began to be connected to it. <br><br><img src="http://img-fotki.yandex.ru/get/5645/86212109.2/0_a0fc2_bc4575dd_L.jpg" alt="image"><br>  <i>Mail text interface</i> <br><br>  <i>In 1971, they</i> developed a program for sending emails between computers on a network.  The first <b>Mail</b> program was created in 1965, it was only used on a single multi-user computer, MIT scientists: <b>Noel Morris</b> and <b>Tom Van Vlec</b> . <br><br>  <i>In 1973,</i> the ARPANET network became international, it was connected to a <b>trans-Atlantic telephone cable</b> , thanks to which various scientific organizations in Europe and the USA were able to exchange data more quickly.  In addition to transatlantic cooperation and e-mail, the 70s also presented us with such concepts as: <i>bulletin boards, newsgroups and newsletters</i> . <br><br>  <i>By the end of the 70s</i> , their own computer networks were created in various states and even universities, but, unfortunately, due to different standards, they could not interact with each other.  In this connection, the world scientific community faced the task of developing uniform protocols for all and standardizing them.  This problem was solved in 1983, when <b>TCP / IP</b> was standardized. <br><br><img src="http://img-fotki.yandex.ru/get/6432/86212109.2/0_a0fbf_a100dd03_L.jpg" alt="image"><br>  <i>‚ÄúBe demanding of what you are sending, and liberal of what you accept‚Äù (c) <s>Father Frost</s> John Postel.</i> <br><br>  A number of first-class scientists participated in the development of uniform standards for network protocols, among which <b>John Postel</b> deserves a special mention, he is one of the main authors of such protocols as: TCP, ICMP, IP, UDP, Telnet, FTP and DNS.  John Postel also participated in the development of more than two hundred RFCs. <br><br>  <i>In 1984,</i> the DNS protocol was developed and <b>domain names</b> were first created. <br><br>  <i>In 1984</i> , the Internet was consistently associated with ARPANET, but unfortunately the first violin was played by the military, who controlled everything.  This state of affairs categorically did not suit scientists.  Therefore, in the same year, in contrast to the ARPANET, they created their own network <s>with blackjack and whores</s> and called it the <b>NSFNet</b> <i>(National Science Foundation Network)</i> - the computer network of the National Science Foundation.  NSFNet united many networks of US universities, it also included such popular networks at that time as <b>Usenet</b> <i>(by the way, trolls and other bad things, to us on the Internet, it moved from there)</i> and <b>Bitnet</b> .  NSFNet absorbed all the advanced technologies of that time and had more bandwidth than ARPANET, it quickly became popular, and over the first year of operation more than 10,000 computers connected to it. <br><br><img src="http://img-fotki.yandex.ru/get/4128/86212109.2/0_a0fbe_d1220f2b_M.jpg" alt="image"><br>  <i>Jarkko Oikarinen</i> <br><br>  <i>In 1988</i> , a Finnish student, <b>Jarkko Oikarinen</b> , developed the <i>Internet Relay Chat (</i> <b>IRC)</b> protocol, with the help of which users were able to communicate with each other in real time, as well as organize conferences in which many participants could attend and communicate at the same time. <br><br><img src="http://img-fotki.yandex.ru/get/6443/86212109.2/0_a0fc7_48104c1e_L.jpg" alt="image"><br>  <i>Sir Timothy John Berners-Lee</i> <br><br>  <i>In 1989</i> , the legend of the <b>modern Internet</b> Tim Berners-Lee working at CERN, proposed the concept of the world wide web - the <b>World Wide Web</b> .  And then within two years I developed the HTTP protocol, URI, URL and created the HTML hypertext markup language.  Thanks to Tim Berners-Lee, a new era of modern Internet has begun, where such notions as sites, browsers, web servers, hyperlinks, etc. have begun to be present. <br><br>  <i>The year 1990 is</i> notable for two events, the first one, ceased to exist, the founder of computer networks, the great ARPANET, the second, access to the Internet was made through a telephone line using dial-up (dial-up). <br><br>  <i>In 1991, the</i> Internet was made publicly available and they began to connect not only educational institutions, but also private homes. <br><br><img src="http://img-fotki.yandex.ru/get/4118/86212109.2/0_a0ffe_d47ca5c3_M.jpg" alt="image"><br>  <i>Mosaic Browser</i> <br><br>  <i>In 1993, the</i> <b>Mosaic</b> browser was created - this is the first browser in the world with a graphical interface, thanks to which there was a sharp jump in the number of Internet users.  Browser Developers: <b>Mark Anderssen</b> and <b>Eric Bean</b> . <br><br>  <b>The</b> <i>World Wide Web Consortium (W3C - World Wide Web Consortium)</i> was founded <b>in 1994.</b> This organization develops and implements uniform technology standards and protocols for the World Wide Web.  In Russia, since 2012, this organization is represented by the <b>HSE</b> <i>(National Research University Higher School of Economics)</i> .  Sir Timothy John Berners-Lee directs the W3C. <br><br>  <i>In 1995,</i> NSFNet supercomputers ceased to be engaged in routing Internet traffic, this function was transferred to <b>private companies-providers</b> . <br><br><img src="http://img-fotki.yandex.ru/get/6437/86212109.2/0_a0fc0_feaa0c0d_L.jpg" alt="image"><br>  <i>Larry Page and Sergey Brin</i> <br><br>  <i>In 1998,</i> the search engine <b>Google</b> , created by <b>Sergey Brin</b> and <b>Larry Page</b> <i>, was</i> born.  At the moment, it is the first search engine in the world and the most successful company in the IT industry.  Net profit in 2012 amounted to $ 11 billion.  In addition to the development of search technologies, the company tries itself in other areas, for example, in 2006, the very popular <b>YouTube</b> video hosting was acquired, and in 2008 Google began to distribute an open operating system for <b>Android</b> smartphones, which now occupies more than half of the market.  From the latest news, Google will be one of the key partners of the US government, which intends to cover the entire territory of the country with free Wi-Fi. <br><br><img src="http://img-fotki.yandex.ru/get/4119/86212109.2/0_a0fc3_ca0e05e7_L.jpg" alt="image"><br>  <i>Mark Zuckerberg</i> <br><br>  After the search engines, a significant Internet event was the emergence of <b>social networks</b> , <b>Facebook Face</b> Company founded by <b>Mark Zuckerberg</b> in 2004 is worth noting.  In October 2012, Mark Zuckerberg announced the appearance of the billionth user in the system. <br><br><img src="http://img-fotki.yandex.ru/get/5628/86212109.2/0_a0fbd_a1ec7c01_L.jpg" alt="image"><br>  <i>Jack Dorsey</i> <br><br>  By the end of the 2000s, when Internet users began to get used to the idea that nothing new could be invented and that only existing technologies would develop, <b>Twitter is</b> rapidly entering the world, the so-called microblogging that allows you to quickly send messages to the Internet of 140 characters.  Twitter creator, <b>Jack Dorsey</b> , he introduced his technology in 2006.  Then she had not yet mastered the minds of users, but gradually gained popularity, for example, in 2007, about 4.5 thousand tweets were sent <b>per day</b> , and in 2010 already 65 million tweets. <br><br><img src="http://img-fotki.yandex.ru/get/4122/86212109.2/0_a0fc6_a81ba697_M.jpg" alt="image"><br>  <i>Stephen Paul Jobs is one of the three founders of Apple.</i> <br><br>  I don‚Äôt know whether to mention Apple and its influence on the development of the Internet, but many believe that their <b>iPhone</b> product made the Internet and smartphone very friendly to each other, which undoubtedly had a positive impact on the growth of the number of network users and the amount of time spent in it . <br><br>  That's basically all I wanted to say about the development of the Internet, I hope you enjoyed it.  If the text does not mention the names of worthy people "creators of the Internet" or companies, write them in the article to the article, also if anyone knows what was the first or largest directory of sites that had the strongest impact on the Internet. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/168833/">https://habr.com/ru/post/168833/</a></p>
