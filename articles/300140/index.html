In the West, this is a common practice and, as it seems to us, for a reason. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/bcd/874/61c/bcd87461c1d3491b8f15fb13e4b4ffec.jpg"><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  It's like a lull when you have to lay low and wait for the verdict.  But in fact, this is a good opportunity, and sometimes another +1 chance to prove himself.  It seems to us that the tradition of follow-up letters is really good, because it is human.  and human-only recruiting is not viable at all, so we want people to say ‚Äúthank you‚Äù to each other.  Even if it is one-sided thanks.  Here are our arguments for: 
      <br>
        <script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>
        <ins class="adsbygoogle"
          style="display:block; text-align:center;"
          data-ad-layout="in-article"
          data-ad-format="fluid"
          data-ad-client="ca-pub-6974184241884155"
          data-ad-slot="8945601208"></ins>

          (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
        </script>
      <br>
      First, the letter allows you to remind yourself again.  If HR spoke to a dozen candidates, and a letter came to him from you, then this is just an additional ‚Äúbell‚Äù.  Believe me, all 10 will not write exactly! <br><br>  Secondly, it is a chance to get rid of understatement, joke or just say about what you have forgotten to say or failed. <br><br>  Thirdly, it is just polite to thank the person for a pleasant conversation, for a chance.  Or maybe you were really pleased to communicate and you want to get backlash - what was wrong, why and what you should work on.  Then, of course, it is worth giving time and send it in a few days. <br><br>  <b>// Here are the templates.</b>  <b>Let's start with # 1.</b> <br>  <i>Good afternoon / evening, [name],</i> <i><br><br></i>  <i>It was very pleasant to talk with you today, despite my excitement.</i>  <i>I want to thank you for the time you gave me, for the answers to questions and attentiveness.</i> <i><br></i>  <i>If you still have any questions to me - I will be happy to answer them!</i> <i><br></i>  <i>Attached to the letter [portfolio] that you asked to send.</i> <i><br></i>  <i>Thank you again for the opportunity to [visit the company's office and get to know the staff, learn more about the values ‚Äã‚Äãof the team].</i> <i><br><br></i>  <i>Respectfully,</i> <i><br></i>  <i>[name]</i> <i><br></i>  <i>+ contacts</i> <br><br>  <b><a href="http://icanchoose.ru/blog/23-besplatnyh-kursa-ot-universitetov-ligi-plyusha/">We collected the</a> best courses from Ivy League universities <a href="http://icanchoose.ru/blog/23-besplatnyh-kursa-ot-universitetov-ligi-plyusha/">here.</a></b> <br><br>  <b>And pattern # 2:</b> <br>  <i>Good afternoon / evening, [name]!</i> <i><br><br></i>  <i>I want to thank you for the opportunity to discuss the specifics of working in the company [name] in the position [name].</i> <i><br></i>  <i>I sincerely believe that my skills, professional experience and personal qualities will help me to become part of a team and prove myself.</i> <i><br></i>  <i>In any case, thank you for taking the time - it was nice to look into the company's office and get to know its work better.</i> <i><br></i>  <i>If you have any other questions, I am always in touch and I will be ready (a) to answer them.</i> <i><br><br></i>  <i>Respectfully,</i> <i><br></i>  <i>[name]</i> <i><br></i>  <i>+ contacts</i> <br><br>  <b>And another pattern # 3:</b> <br>  <i>Good afternoon / evening, [name],</i> <i><br><br></i>  <i>I hasten to thank you for the interview and the opportunity to look at the work of the company [name].</i> <i><br></i>  <i>In addition, after all he saw, I even wanted to become part of the company.</i> <i><br></i>  <i>Thank you for your attentiveness, your time and conversation.</i>  <i>I would be glad to hear from you again.</i> <i><br></i>  <i>I still have one question about [subject + question].</i> <i><br></i>  <i>I will wait for an answer!</i> <i><br><br></i>  <i>Respectfully,</i> <i><br></i>  <i>[name]</i> <i><br></i>  <i>+ contacts</i> <br><br>  <b>// What mistakes while writing a letter can you make:</b> <b><br></b> <br>  - Excessive politeness / try to limit yourself to at least two thanks (thanks) and no more, otherwise it will look silly / <br><br>  - Flattery / do not drive to madness, do not praise the company and HR'a, it is inappropriate / <br><br>  - Excessive emotionality / you should not talk about how much you want to work there and right now in one place you now have an awl - they said that they are generally inspired by this idea and that's enough (it should be honest, but in half a year everything will get tired :) ) / <br><br>  - The desire to say everything that did not have time (a) / is not always a good idea, because the essence of such a letter is gratitude, but if you really want to identify something important or send something that you discussed during the interview, go ahead / <br><br>  - Pity / in no case put pressure on the person on the other side of the screen - no need to say that this is your last chance or that you just smash yourself into work for the sake of work, it is better to be more modest / <br><br>  - Confidence that you will be taken / ‚Äúreally looking forward to continuing‚Äù - everyone understands that you didn‚Äôt just come to hang out, but you want to be offered a position, but if this doesn‚Äôt happen, you should still be grateful for the time, the opportunity to train interviewing skills and so on/ <br><br>  <b><a href="http://icanchoose.ru/blog/edinstvennyj-normalnyj-sovet-dlya-karernogo-rosta/">+ Advice for career growth (very popular article on Medium)</a></b> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/300140/">https://habr.com/ru/post/300140/</a></p>
