If the transistor in the input voltage protection circuit does not match the parameters from the specification?  Then your product will have serious problems.  The microcontroller can fail, and the circuit can not cope with the load. <br><br>  In fact, it is not your fault or design error.  The reason - in fake chips.

      On fakes you can earn money.  A <a href="https://www.smta.org/chapters/files/SMTA_Great_Lakes_Chapter_Counterfeit_Components_-Integra_Mark_Marshall_(4-11_General)_handout_2.pdf">counterfeit market study</a> states that some firms earn $ 2 million a month by selling just one type of counterfeit component. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h1>  Problem </h1><br>  When a distributor does not have a specific component in stock, sometimes manufacturers and developers have to deal with brokers and third-party suppliers.  This happens if the item is needed urgently or at a lower price.  Be that as it may, they may become victims of the purchase of fake chips that are distributed in different ways.  Defects begin to appear with small failures, and ends with a complete failure. <br><br>  The use of fakes is a big risk.  And often they go unnoticed until all components are assembled into a printed circuit board.  The subsequent alteration will cost much and take a lot of time. <br><br><h1>  Is this a serious problem? </h1><br>  This is a growing threat in the global market.  In November 2011, the US Senate Committee on Armed Forces held hearings in connection with an increase in the number of fake components in the US military supply chain.  The committee <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/272477142_Counterfeit_Integrated_Circuits_Detection_and_Avoidance">initiated an audit of contractors of the Ministry of Defense</a> . <br><br>  Moreover, as a result of the use of counterfeit microelectronics, serious disasters can occur.  Here are examples of some incidents mentioned in the <a href="https://www.semiconductors.org/clientuploads/Anti-Counterfeiting/SIA%2520Anti-Counterfeiting%2520Whitepaper.pdf">report of the Association of the semiconductor industry SIA</a> : <br><br><ul><li>  The broker has shipped fake microcontrollers for brake systems of European high-speed trains. </li><li>  The intermediary has shipped fake semiconductor components for use in nuclear submarines. </li></ul><br>  So yes.  This is a serious global threat. <br><br><h1>  Problem in numbers </h1><br>  Many reports and studies estimate the scale of counterfeit.  In the report of the International Chamber of Commerce from 2008, the annual market volume in the G-20 countries was estimated at $ 775 billion with an <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/272477142_Counterfeit_Integrated_Circuits_Detection_and_Avoidance">increase to $ 1.7 trillion in 2015</a> . <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/cb3/ca8/7aa/cb3ca87aafe3ea94cba658b1fcb65729.png"><br>  <i><font color="gray">Fig.</font></i>  <i><font color="gray">1. Number of reported incidents with counterfeit components reported by IHS, <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/272477142_Counterfeit_Integrated_Circuits_Detection_and_Avoidance">source</a></font></i> <br><br>  <a href="http://www.ajbasweb.com/old/ajbas/2014/December/37-42.pdf">Another study</a> conducted by the US Department of Commerce from 2005 to 2008 showed that 50% of component manufacturers and 55% of distributors encountered counterfeit components. <br><br>  Moreover, experts estimated that among all Pentagon's purchases of spare and replacement components, up to 15% are counterfeit products. <br><br><h1>  Fake methods </h1><br>  Hackers, intellectual property hijackers and counterfeiters always adapt quickly and find new methods.  In this article, we mention the most common methods of manufacturing fakes. <br><br>  Experts usually divide methods into categories: <br><br><ul><li>  New components with incorrect marking and old components that are sold as new.  <a href="https://www.smta.org/chapters/files/SMTA_Great_Lakes_Chapter_Counterfeit_Components_-Integra_Mark_Marshall_(4-11_General)_handout_2.pdf">[one]</a> </li><li>  Functional and non-functional counterfeit.  <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/272477142_Counterfeit_Integrated_Circuits_Detection_and_Avoidance">[2]</a> </li></ul><br>  I would like to analyze the second classification in more detail. <br><br>  As a starting point, let's take a classification from <a href="https://www.smta.org/chapters/files/SMTA_Great_Lakes_Chapter_Counterfeit_Components_-Integra_Mark_Marshall_(4-11_General)_handout_2.pdf">this work</a> and improve it. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/6cc/635/064/6cc6350649742df4d029697b0d87ddce.png"><br>  <i><font color="gray">Fig.</font></i>  <i><font color="gray">2. Taxation of fakes, <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/272477142_Counterfeit_Integrated_Circuits_Detection_and_Avoidance">source</a></font></i> <br><br><h1>  Remarking and Recycling </h1><br>  This is the most common way to fake.  Over 80% of the counterfeit components were <a href="http://www.ajbasweb.com/old/ajbas/2014/December/37-42.pdf">recycled and remarked</a> .  During recycling, components are removed from recycled printed circuit boards, their enclosures are repainted and / or remarked, and then they are sold as new parts. <br><br>  In some cases, the crystal is removed from the case, then mounted in a new case and remarked for the desired device.  Here the most dangerous, if the component is not functional or was damaged during previous use. <br><br>  Extraction of the crystal includes acid decapsulation of the plastic body, extraction of wire joints (which connect the crystal with external pins) using tweezers, heating of the body and grinding the back side.  Then the crystals are sent to China for assembly in new buildings. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/980/0a8/0c1/9800a80c120cac60630fe719c0c2f2d7.jpg"><br>  <i><font color="gray">Fig.</font></i>  <i><font color="gray">3.

The original design is cloned using reverse engineering. <br><br>  Falsified components may include ‚Äúhardware trojans‚Äù and may merge valuable information to the manufacturer.  In fact, reverse engineering and the introduction of hardware Trojans is a separate broad topic for another article. <br><br><h1>  Other fakes </h1><br><ul><li>  Lack of crystal inside.  The manufacturer simply puts the desired labeling on the empty case.  It is easy to detect by x-ray. </li><li> Some designers order the production of chips for their design.  Sometimes an unreliable contractor produces an extra batch of original microchips without notifying the customer.  This is dangerous because the crystal and the case look exactly like the original, while counterfeit chips could not pass the tests provided by the customer before being delivered to the market. </li><li>  Fake documents.  No physical forgery in the chips, but the attacker adds / changes some details in the documents.  These may be fake specifications or electrical specifications. </li></ul><br><h1>  Counterfeit Detection Techniques </h1><br>  If you want to protect your home or office, the first thing you need to do is change your thinking style: think not as a guard, but as a thief.  The first step to defending against fake ICs is to learn the methods of the enemy. <br><br>  The second step is to look for clues. <br><br>  Defects seem innumerable.  The proposed taxonomy of defects shows the overall picture. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/3db/b35/85d/3dbb3585d35198b7230ce2baa81e5b53.jpg"><br>  <i><font color="gray">Fig.</font></i>  <i><font color="gray">8.

By the way, some of them are easiest to detect with the naked eye. <br><br><h3>  Set of examples 1 (external examination) </h3><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/28b/207/17f/28b20717f9473efd5531141a18ae6eaa.jpg"><br>  Fig.  9.

Picture CADBlog</font></i> <br><br>  The fake integrated circuit may not have the intended connections.  They may disappear when repacking the crystal.  An x-ray is used to detect this defect. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/ba1/c1d/92e/ba1c1d92e0dfc741006d94d75e5d2a86.jpg"><br>  <i><font color="gray">Fig.</font></i>  <i><font color="gray">14. Absence of connections, <a href="https://www.springer.com/la/book/9783319118239">source</a></font></i> <br><br>  Another variant of internal defects is the use of a completely wrong crystal.  For example, the American company Sparkfun found a supply of fake Atmega328 microcontrollers.  <a href="https://www.sparkfun.com/news/364">The study revealed</a> that they have the marking and body Atmega328, but the crystal inside does not even closely match the original microcontroller! <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/574/5a9/ee8/5745a9ee87b7593b8fdac7e7645a596c.jpg"><br>  <i><font color="gray">Fig.</font></i>  <i><font color="gray">15.

Methods of combating counterfeit, <a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6856206/">source</a></font></i> <br><br>  Let us consider some of these methods in more detail. <br><br><h3>  CDIR sensor </h3><br>  As the name of the sensor CDIR (Combating Die and IC Recycling), it is a method of dealing with the reuse of integrated circuits. <br><br>  As a CDIR sensor, you can use different structures on a chip, but for the sake of simplicity, we mention only one of them: a sensor based on a ring oscillator (RO).  Other structures see <a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6856206/">here</a> . <br><br>  This sensor captures every turn on the chip and makes it easy to check the data.  It is composed of two ring generators: the RO sample and the RO under load.  The principle is based on the fact that the effect of aging MOSFET changes the frequency of the RO.  From the difference between the frequency of the RO sample and the RO under load, you can calculate the approximate chip usage time. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/725/377/345/725377345284dd610f71059b8793f84d.png"><br>  <i><font color="gray">Fig.</font></i>  <i><font color="gray">18. RO-sensor circuit, <a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6856206/">source</a></font></i> <br><br><h3>  Safe Split Test (SST) </h3><br>  As already mentioned in the chapter on counterfeit production methods, some developers give the production to an outside contractor.  Sometimes it can produce an extra amount of original design chips without the knowledge of the owner of the intellectual property or even sell the design.  To prevent this, the production process can be protected by cryptographic methods, that is, blocking individual hardware components of the chip with their owner unlocking the intellectual property during or after the test.  The interaction of the owner of the intellectual property with the factory and the assembly line <a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6856206/">using the SST method is</a> shown in the following diagram: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/715/e38/664/715e386642c5443bf9dd2092411c85d9.png"><br>  <i><font color="gray">Fig.</font></i>  <i><font color="gray">19. Interactions between the owner of the intellectual property, the manufacturer and the assembly line, <a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6856206/">source</a></font></i> <br><br>  First, the owner of the intellectual property receives a random number (TRN) from the factory, generates a test key (TKEY) using the secret key and sends it to the factory for each crystal.  There from TKEY using the public key is created by a modified TRN, which is used for testing.  The owner receives the test results and can either refuse the batch or transfer TKEY to the assembly line for the manufacture of microchips if the test results are positive. <br><br>  The assembly shop receives a TRN from the owner of the intellectual property and, after mounting the crystal in the case, again carries out tests.  Then sends the answer to the owner of the intellectual property.  That unlocks good chips using the final key (FKEY) - and sends them to the market. <br><br><h1>  DNA labeling </h1><br>  This mechanism is part of the broader Package ID technology.  It covers the following examples: <br><br><ul><li>  a design that leaves no room for adding additional components, </li><li>  active components without the authority to change the mask (pattern in production), </li><li>  obsolete components that are no longer manufactured. </li></ul><br>  In the case of DNA labeling, molecules with a unique DNA sequence are mixed into the ink for labeling.  To verify the authenticity of the chips, ink samples are sent to the lab.  The technology requires maintaining a database of valid sequences. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/7f1/8ff/57f/7f18ff57fbe879e9b53c1f430055688f.jpg"><br><br><h1>  Physically unclonable function (PUF) </h1><br>  A physical random function or a physically non-cloning function (PUF) is a function with a random result associated with the physical characteristics of the device.  It is random and unpredictable, but repeatable under the same conditions.  Since during the production process uncontrolled and unpredictable changes are made, no two chips are identical, but a silicon PUF with a unique identifier can be embedded in the chip. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/26e/a3d/8a7/26ea3d8a77d40a3184dfe0c4ff9cdab4.png"><br>  <i><font color="gray">Fig.</font></i>  <i><font color="gray">20, adapted from <a href="https://people.csail.mit.edu/devadas/pubs/puf-dac07.pdf">source</a></font></i> <br><br>  The PUF measures the response for specific input data.  Many methods are used to get the question-answer pair.  One of them is the PUF delay, as shown in Fig.  20. Random changes in delays at contacts and gates of a crystal give random results.  Arbitrator usually acts shutter, which gives 1 or 0, depending on which input came first.  The PUF can support a huge number of question-answer pairs, where the answer is unique to each integrated circuit.  Authentication operations require a trusted database of question-answer pairs. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/422843/">https://habr.com/ru/post/422843/</a></p>
