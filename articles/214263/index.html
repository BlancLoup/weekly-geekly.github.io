      <br>
      To implement this plan, I propose to send a polite (necessarily polite! For we are not barbarians!) Letter to the State Duma. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  The letter can be sent electronically (which is fast and completely free) and also in the form of five (or more) modest A4 paper sheets with text (why five "and more" - it will be clear when you finish reading) and even such wonderful vintage technology as "telegram ". <br><br>  But first things first. <br><br><h4>  Let's start with the simplest and fastest option - electronic. </h4><br>  <b>Procedure:</b> <br><br><ol><li>  Go to the page with the form of appeal: <a href="http://www.duma.gov.ru/representative/addresses/leave/">www.duma.gov.ru/representative/addresses/leave</a> </li><li>  Fill in the main fields: <b>Name and Surname and email</b> (your real name and email, we are applying as Citizens) </li><li>  In the To address field, specify: <b>Chairman of the State Duma Naryshkin Sergey Evgenievich</b> </li><li>  Message text: </li></ol><br><br><blockquote>  Good day. <br><br>  I appeal to the Chairman of the State Duma, deputies of the State Duma of the 6th convocation, heads of factions of the State Duma of the 6th convocation with a request to remove from consideration bills 428896-6, 428884-6 and 428889-6 and discuss them at open public hearings with the involvement of experts on the development of civil society and e-democracy in Russia, the Internet industry, telecom operators, all sectors of the economy, whose activity depends on the quality of the Internet, speed and availability of cashless payments. <br><br>  These bills can have a negative impact on the fulfillment of the instructions given by the President for the development of small and medium-sized businesses in the Russian Federation, complicate the fight against corruption (as they repeatedly expand the field for possible abuses), and contradict the task formulated by the President to support small and medium businesses the territory of the Russian Federation, impose technically impossible obligations on resources operating in the Russian segment of the Internet. <br><br>  Also, despite the declared ‚Äúanti-terrorism‚Äù orientation, none of the aforementioned draft laws contain measures that can have a significant impact on the methods actually used to finance modern terrorist groups in the Russian Federation (in accordance with an interview given by the Head of North Caucasus Federal District, Police Colonel-General Sergei Chenchik of Rossiyskaya Gazeta, published December 16, 2013. <br><br>  The latter circumstance means that these bills can not only cause potentially adverse consequences, but also are not capable of exerting the declared influence, which indicates the need for their cardinal refinement. <br></blockquote><br><br>  <b><u>Bonus points:</u></b> <br>  Send a copy of this letter to the distinguished President of the Russian Federation V.V.  Putin can be here: <a href="http://letters.kremlin.ru/send">letters.kremlin.ru/send</a> <br>  EDIT: <br>  ( <b>Of course, to send a letter to the President, it is necessary to change a little</b> , because this letter is to Putin. <br>  For example, the text <i>‚ÄúGood afternoon.</i>  <i>I appeal to the Chairman of the State Duma, deputies of the State Duma of the 6th convocation, heads of factions of the State Duma of the 6th convocation with a request to remove from consideration the bills 428896-6, 428884-6 and 428889-6 and discuss them ... "</i> replaced with the text <i>" Dear Vladimir Vladimirovich!</i>  <i>I ask you to contribute to the removal from consideration of the bills 428896-6, 428884-6 and 428889-6 with the aim of their extensive discussion ... "</i> ) <br><br>  EDIT: <br>  In the ‚ÄúTheme‚Äù clause, in my humble opinion, the topics ‚ÄúCivil Law‚Äù and ‚ÄúInformation and Informatization‚Äù are suitable ( <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/214263/">‚ÄúCivil Law‚Äù seems to fit a little more</a> ) <br><br>  After this little improvement, send a letter to the President. <br><br>  <i>A letter to the president is fast and secure.</i> <br><br>  More difficult is to send a paper letter. <br><br>  In my humble opinion, it would be commendable to duplicate the leaders of the factions, so there will be as many as five letters. <br><br><h4>  The option is long, but ‚Äútraditional‚Äù and in the eyes of many more weighty - paper letter </h4><br><br>  EDIT: ATTENTION!  Just in case, I remind you once again, your full name, address, and your other details must be authentic (just in case I <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/214263/">provide a detailed explanation</a> ) <br><br>  <b>Text of the letter (best printed text is Times new roman 12, one-and-a-half spacing, A4 format. Boring, but readable):</b> <br><br><blockquote>  Where: <br>  103265, Moscow, Okhotny Ryad, d.1.  The State Duma <br><br>  To: <br>  To the Chairman of the State Duma, Sergey Naryshkin <br>  Vladimir Abdualiyevich Vasilyev, head of the United Russia faction <br>  The head of the Communist Party faction Zyuganov Gennady Andreyevich <br>  The head of the faction "Fair Russia" Mironov Sergey Mikhailovich <br>  To the head of the LDPR faction Vladimir Zhirinovsky <br><br>  From whom: <br>  <b>Full name of the sender (in full), date of birth, address of registration (you can also passport number for reliability)</b> <br><br>  Good day. <br><br>  I appeal to the Chairman of the State Duma, deputies of the State Duma of the 6th convocation, heads of factions of the State Duma of the 6th convocation with a request to remove from consideration bills 428896-6, 428884-6 and 428889-6 and discuss them at open public hearings with the involvement of experts on the development of civil society and e-democracy in Russia, the Internet industry, telecom operators, all sectors of the economy, whose activity depends on the quality of the Internet, speed and availability of cashless payments. <br><br>  These bills can have a negative impact on the fulfillment of the instructions given by the President for the development of small and medium-sized businesses in the Russian Federation, complicate the fight against corruption (as they repeatedly expand the field for possible abuses), and contradict the task formulated by the President to support small and medium businesses the territory of the Russian Federation, impose technically impossible obligations on resources operating in the Russian segment of the Internet. <br><br>  Also, despite the declared ‚Äúanti-terrorism‚Äù orientation, none of the aforementioned draft laws contain measures that can have a significant impact on the methods actually used to finance modern terrorist groups in the Russian Federation (in accordance with an interview given by the Head of North Caucasus Federal District, Police Colonel-General Sergei Chenchik of Rossiyskaya Gazeta, published December 16, 2013. <br><br>  The latter circumstance means that these bills can not only cause potentially adverse consequences, but also are not capable of exerting the declared influence, which indicates the need for their cardinal refinement. <br><br>  <b>Number <u>(freehand, blue pen)</u> Signature <u>(freehand, same blue pen)</u></b> <br><br></blockquote><br><br>  We pack each of the five copies into a separate envelope, and ship each envelope to a separate recipient (one of the five listed in the ‚Äúto‚Äù section). <br><br>  If money is not a pity, it is best to send first class. <br><br>  <b><u>Bonus points:</u></b> <br>  The most patient can send this text to the same recipients via a telegram, this <i>amazing</i> way of transmitting information is still <i>unexpectedly</i> respected in the various governing structures of our country. <br>  A telegram sometimes requires an amazing amount of time to be sent, but from personal experience of appeals to ‚Äúorgans‚Äù, the telegram has a surprisingly beneficial, motivating effect on the addressee. <br><br>  EDIT: It <b>is very desirable to send telegrams</b> , as they have a strange ability to reach people who, for unknown reasons, do not receive regular and e-mails (or are astronomically delayed) <br><br>  EDIT: <br>  <b><u>even more Bonus points:</u></b> <br>  <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/users/temych/" class="user_link">Temych</a> <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/214263/">also</a> recommends <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/214263/">sending this letter to those</a> directly responsible for these barbaric bills (the text can be left to the same, just add these people to the ‚Äúto‚Äù section and type more letters, send more envelopes (remember, one person from the ‚ÄúTo‚Äù field - one letter - a separate envelope!) <br>  I duplicate the list of these people: <br>  Under the draft law No. 428884-6 - responsible - the State Duma Committee on Information Policy, Information Technologies and Communications - deputy Alexey V. Mitrofanov <br>  ‚Ññ 428896-6 - State Duma Committee on the Financial Market - Deputy Burykina Natalya Viktorovna <br>  ‚Ññ 428889-6 - State Duma Committee on Security and Anti-Corruption - Deputy Yarovaya Irina Anatolyevna <br><br>  <b>Let's not look silently at trying to ruin our industry.</b> <br><br>  PS: <br>  Copyrights and acknowledgements <br><br>  This post would not exist if it were not for the beneficial influence of <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/147484/">this post</a> and its esteemed author. <br>  The letters that we sent then played a role in <a href="http://m.gazeta.ru/social/news/2012/07/10/n_2430529.shtml">softening the norms of another completely barbaric law</a> . <br><br>  I dare to hope, this time the effect will also be positive. <br><br>  <b>PPS:</b> <b><br></b>  <b>They pointed out to me here that I made a huge omission in my instructions - the Vasilyev Vladimir Abdualiyevich is now leading the EP faction.</b> <b><br></b>  <b>Text corrected.</b> <b><br><br></b>  <b>I really hope that those who have planned to send paper letters still come here and make corrections.</b> <b><br></b>  <b>I apologize for the mistake.</b> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/214263/">https://habr.com/ru/post/214263/</a></p>
