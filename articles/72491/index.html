  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Big Brother in Linux or do it yourself video surveillance</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Big brother in Linux or video surveillance with their own hands. <br><br>  After moving to a new office, in order not to relax the staff, it was decided <br>  install video surveillance system.  But, as usual, the main condition was: <br>  cheap and cheerful :) After deliberation and calculations, it was decided to stop at <br>  following: <br>  IP cameras and computer as a recorder. <br>  For starters, we tried the well-known ZoneMinder.  But for some reason with 9 cameras, he <br>  shipped the system mercilessly.  After some struggle with him, it was decided to abandon <br>  him  Searching the Internet was found a program called <br>  motion (http://www.lavrsen.dk/twiki/bin/view/Motion/WebHome).  Reading a little <br>  about her, it was decided to stop at her. <br>  So, we had IP cameras, a computer as a recorder, motion in <br>  the quality of software and the desire to make friends all this collective farm :) <a name="habracut"></a><br>  And what can the motion of what we want?  :) <br>  1. Work with cameras connected via capture cards or with IP cameras. <br>  2. Execute scripts at the onset and end of the event. <br><br>  Well, let's get started.  First, let's try with one camera :) <br>  Install the motion. <br>  Next, in the folder / etc / motion / copy the configuration file (motion.conf) to the file <br>  for our camera, for example motion1.conf.  And now we begin to rule it under <br>  yourself: <br>  1. comment out the line <br>  videodevice / dev / video0 <br>  2. in the netcam_url line, we register the URL for access to our camera.  we <br>  used Axis IP cameras, model 207 (with built-in microphone). <br>  For our case it looked like this: <br>  netcam_url <br>  <a href="http/">http</a> : //camera_ip/axis-cgi/mjpg/video.cgi? resolution = 640x480 <br>  where camera_ip is the IP address of the camera :) <br>  3. Further we find the string target_dir - here we specify the path to the folder where we will be <br>  store data from the camera. <br>  4. And now the fun begins.  Find the string on_event_start.  Here <br>  we prescribe a command that will be executed when an event occurs, then <br>  there is when driving.  What does this give us?  And it gives us something that we will not <br>  constantly keep a record, but only if necessary - there is movement, recording is in progress, <br>  ended, and we stopped.  This is how savings come about.  For <br>  comparison - we are recording with 10 cameras - color image 640x480 with <br>  sound, records are stored for 21 days and the whole thing takes on disk an average of 135 <br>  GB, and vseste with photos, which makes the motion about 200 GB. <br>  5. the next line: on_event_end is for the command that runs on <br>  the end of the event. <br>  6. And one more thing, motion raises a small http server, and since for <br>  Each camera starts its own instance of the program with a separate config, then <br>  It is important that he listened at different ports.  To do this, check that the following <br>  the lines differed in each file: <br>  webcam_port and control_port <br>  For example: for the first camera, set the values <br>  webcam_port 8081 <br>  control_port 8080 <br>  for the second <br>  webcam_port 8083 <br>  control_port 8082 <br>  and so on.

      <br>
      This is basically a major change.  I think when you carefully read the config you <br>  you will find the parameters you need, since everything is pretty good there <br>  documented. <br><br>  Now back to the scripts that work out at the beginning and end <br>  developments. <br>  Since we need to write video from the camera, for this I used the mencoder. <br>  In the folder / root / bin / create scripts recordstart.sh and recordstop.sh, which <br>  will be launched at the onset and end of the event, respectively. <br>  Let's look inside recordstart.sh: <br><br>  [root @ video bin] # cat /root/bin/recordstart.sh <br>  #! / bin / bash <br><br>  # We are using two variables <br>  # 1 - camera name <br>  # 2 - directory name (where file will be stored) <br><br>  # Generate filename <br>  start = "cam $ {1}" <br>  dt = `date +% Y% m% d% H% M% S` <br>  FILENAME = "$ {start} - $ {dt} .avi" <br>  echo $ FILENAME <br><br>  if ["$ 1" -eq 218] <br>  then <br>  `/ usr / bin / mencoder -ovc copy -oac pcm -delay 1.5 -mc 10 -o <br>  / video / motion / $ 2 / $ FILENAME rtsp: //192.168.95.218/mpeg4/media.amp&gt; / dev / null` <br>  elif ["$ 1" -eq 219] <br>  then <br>  `/ usr / bin / mencoder -ovc copy -oac pcm -delay 1.5 -mc 10 -o <br>  / video / motion / $ 2 / $ FILENAME rtsp: //192.168.95.219/mpeg4/media.amp&gt; / dev / null` <br>  else <br>  `/ usr / bin / mencoder -ovc copy -oac pcm -mc 10 -o / video / motion / $ 2 / $ FILENAME <br>  rtsp: //192.168.95.$1/mpeg4/media.amp&gt; / dev / null` <br>  fi <br><br>  The script takes two parameters: <br>  1 - the name of the camera, although the name is not quite true, since this is the last octet from the IP <br>  camera addresses.  That is, as in our case (we use the 95 subnet - 192.168.95.0/24).  Thus, when transmitting the value of 211 - it will be clear that <br>  we want to contact the camera with IP 192.168.95.211 <br>  2 - directory where the recorded file will be stored.  Made to <br>  it was easier to search.  Again in our case: there is a folder / video / motion in <br>  which records are stored, but in order not to interfere with everything in a heap, it contains <br>  Subdirectories of zones: kuhnya, balkon, etc.  This means that when transferring the balcon value - the recording will be made in the / video / motion / balkon directory. <br><br>  So, when calling the script in the form /root/bin/recordstart.sh 211 balkon - script <br>  will write from the camera with IP 192.168.95.211 to the directory / video / motion / balkon. <br>  I hope it is more and more clear :) <br><br>  As you can see, at first we generate a unique name for the file, in which we will <br>  write, which consists of the following parts: <br>  start - the camera number, or rather the last octet from its IP with the preceding cam. <br>  dt is the current date in the format YYYYMMDDHHmmss. <br>  Example of the file name: cam218-20090924131847.avi - that is, it is written from the camera with IP <br>  192.168.95.218, start date: 2009, 09 month, 24 number, 13 hours, 18 minutes, <br>  47 seconds. <br><br>  A small explanation: it turned out that we have different camera models that <br>  provide different ways to access video data stream, because of this <br>  had to type in the validation script. <br>  Now go through the mencoder: <br>  -ovc copy - means that the video sequence is copied, since it immediately goes from the camera to <br>  mpeg4 <br>  -oac pcm - which codec to use for the audio track, if the camera allows <br>  write sound. <br>  -mc 10 - Maximum value of AV sync adjustment per frame (in <br>  seconds) <br>  -delay 1.5 - Delay in ms, which must be made in each channel <br><br>  If you have problems with synchronizing video and audio series, then you need to change <br>  the values ‚Äã‚Äãfor the last two parameters are mc and delay. <br>  For the test, you can use mplayer. <br><br>  Well, now when an event occurs, we can run this script. <br>  Thus, in the config for motion for our camera, we write in the line <br>  on_event_start is something similar: <br>  on_event_start "/root/bin/recordstart.sh 210 koridor1" <br><br>  And he will start writing :))) <br>  But it still needs to be stopped :))) <br>  To do this, use the second script /root/bin/recordstop.sh. <br><br>  [root @ video bin] # cat /root/bin/recordstop.sh <br>  #! / bin / bash <br><br>  # We are using one variable <br>  # 1 - camera name <br><br>  # Get string with mencoder process PID <br>  MPID = `ps ax |  grep mencoder |  grep cam $ {1} |  awk '{print $ 1}' ` <br><br>  # Kill process <br>  `kill -15 $ MPID` <br><br>  The script takes one parameter - the same last octet from the IP address. <br>  cameras. <br><br>  Correspondingly, in the on_event_end line of the configuration file, we write something <br>  like: <br>  on_event_end "/root/bin/recordstop.sh 210" <br><br>  Well, that's all about the configuration. <br>  We now turn to routine operations :) <br>  I use two, which work on the crown. <br>  1. Removes obsolete files that are more than 21 days old. <br>  2. Combines all the files for the day in one. <br><br>  Consider a cleanup script.  I have it located in the / root / sbin directory <br>  and, <br>  in order that enemies did not guess, is called clean.sh <br><br>  [root @ video ~] # cat /root/sbin/clean.sh <br>  #! / bin / sh <br><br>  / bin / find / video / balkon -name "*. *" -mtime +21 -delete <br>  / bin / find / video / motion / balkon -name "*. *" -mtime +21 -delete <br><br>  The first directory stores photos taken by motion - this is an option from <br>  configuration file in the target_dir line. <br>  The second directory is where the video launched from the recordstart.sh script is written <br><br>  But the second script is more complicated. <br>  [root @ video ~] # cat /root/sbin/concatfiles.py <br>  import os, stat, types, commands <br><br>  workDir = '/ video / motion /' <br>  dirs = os.listdir (workDir) <br>  oldDate = summaryFile = summaryFileTmp = '' <br>  for dir in dirs: <br>  filesList = os.listdir (workDir + dir) <br>  filesList.sort () <br>  for file in filesList: <br>  tmpN = file.split ('.') <br>  nm = tmpN [0] <br>  tmpN = nm.split ('-') <br>  if tmpN [0]! = 'S': <br>  nm = tmpN [1] <br>  year = nm [0: 4] <br>  month = nm [4: 6] <br>  day = nm [6: 8] <br>  date = year + month + day <br>  if oldDate! = date: <br>  summaryFile = workDir + dir + '/ S-' + tmpN [0] + '-' + year + <br>  month + day + '.avi' <br>  summaryFileTmp = workDir + dir + '/ S-' + tmpN [0] + '-' + year + <br>  month + day + '-tmp.avi' <br>  #conactenate files <br>  command = '/ usr / bin / mencoder -oac copy -ovc copy' + workDir + <br>  dir + '/' + tmpN [0] + '-' + date + '* .avi -o' + summaryFileTmp <br>  os.system (command) <br>  #fix key frame <br>  command = 'ffmpeg -i' + summaryFileTmp + '-ss 0.04 -vcodec <br>  copy -acodec copy -vcodec copy -acodec copy '+ summaryFile <br>  os.system (command) <br>  #remove tmp file <br>  command = '/ bin / rm -f' + summaryFileTmp <br>  os.system (command) <br>  #remove old files <br>  command = '/ bin / rm -f' + workDir + dir + '/' + tmpN [0] + '-' + <br>  date + '* .avi' <br>  os.system (command) <br>  oldDate = date <br><br>  This is to combine short clips per day into one total.  (For those who do not <br>  in the course - he is on python). <br>  The only thing that needs to be changed is the workDir variable - the path where mencoder <br>  writes its files, all from the same recordstart.sh <br><br>  Register them in crowns to be performed once a day, preferably at night, until the carriage <br>  will not turn into a pumpkin :) <br><br>  Run motion as follows: <br>  motion -c / path / to / config / file <br><br>  Where <br>  / path / to / config / file - the path to our file with the config :) <br><br>  And then run them when the system boots. <br><br>  Well, that's probably all :) <br>  If you have questions - ask :) <br><br>  <b>UPD:</b> be careful with the script on the python, since the whole got lost <br>  tabulation, which is very critical for him. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/72491/">https://habr.com/ru/post/72491/</a></p>
