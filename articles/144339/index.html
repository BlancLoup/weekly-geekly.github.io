In these articles I will try to set out my vision for the <b>near</b> future of the Internet as much as possible.  Why did I decide to write about the future?  Because I believe that thoughts drawn from what I have read, gathered into a single whole concept, supplemented by personal considerations, will also be useful to others, especially those who want to go to the future, to conquer the IT market, and not to do what tomorrow will become useless.  What is the subject of copyright mentioned here?  In my opinion, it is the concept of Web 2.0 that has completely destroyed the current copyright protection scheme, and just the concept of Web 3.0 will solve the problem of copyright in unexpected ways.  But more about that in the following articles.  And now let's pay attention to the topic of the Web 3.0 interface. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><ul><li>  <b>Hybrid OS, browser and social network or dancing with a tambourine around the "search".</b>  Web browsers did an excellent job with the tasks of Web 1.0 (for which they were created), in Web 2.0 they already look crooked and present some difficulties for designers and programmers (the ‚Äúbrowser war‚Äù), but Web 3.0 will completely ruin them in that capacity in which we used to see them ( <a href="http://webtrends.about.com/od/web20/a/end-web-browser_3.htm">Will Web 3.0 Bring the End of the Web Browser?</a> ).  The site interface will increasingly borrow from the browser and the operating system.  Technologies similar to these are the <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/95337/">AeroWindow jQuery plugin.</a>  <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/95337/">Creating windows in the style of Windows Aero</a> , <a href="http://www.trendskitchens.co.nz/jquery/contextmenu/">ContextMenu plugin</a> , <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3DrOOYK8RO6u4">Mozilla Aurora</a> will be ubiquitous.  Windows, the Start panel, the Desktop, creating shortcuts and dragging them across the work surface, history, bookmarks, etc. - all this will be available on the website.  Editing documents, cloud storage, programming, design, work with video and photos ... All or almost all the functions of the browser and operating system will be implemented on the web.  A separate site built on Web 3.0 technology will actually replace the browser and OS.  Why, in this case, run the browser to go to just one site?  And there is the concept of a browser site or, to be exact, a browser social network (google chrome is a similar concept, with the only difference being that Google can only attract visitors to a search engine, maps or translator, but cannot accustom visitors to initially Google+, and then everything else, cannot accustom the visitor to put g + instead of ‚Äúlike‚Äù).  Facebook will launch ‚Äúsearch‚Äù soon ( <a href="http://www.businessweek.com/articles/2012-03-28/facebook-delves-deeper-into-search">Facebook Delves Deeper Into Search</a> ).  Is it so difficult to search for information in social networks?  Yes, they <s>were created</s> to make it easier to search for information and people.  ‚ÄúSearch‚Äù is needed to search for information outside the network, to monitor information on websites and other networks (in fact, it is noticeable that in social networks, especially large, non-profile ones, information is becoming harder to search for).  If facebook thus understands the concept of search, then the browser from facebook will become the most popular browser in the world.  And for Google, this is misericorde (a merciful death after several years of agony).  Microsoft managed to make an original decision in this area - to implement the concept of ‚Äúsocial‚Äù search ( <a href="http://www.theverge.com/2012/5/10/3010051/microsoft-new-bing-hands-on">Google‚Äôs Search Plus Your World (hands-on)</a> ) and search-social network ( <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/144307/">So.cl</a> ), which after several rebirths became available to a wide range of <a href="http://news.zn.ua/TECHNOLOGIES/microsoft_zapustila_poiskovuyu_sotsialnuyu_set-102445.html">Microsoft launched a "search" social network</a> .  Who controls the search - that controls the Web.  The most popular sites of the era of Web 1.0 (I will not look into the XX century in this article) were yahoo.com, google.com, <s>yandex.ru</s> .  The most popular Web 2.0 site is Facebook.com.  Everything is relevant in due time.  Previously, there was a current search on sites.  Now relevant search on social networks.  And yet, I would like to devote one of the following articles to the subject of ‚Äúsearch‚Äù and the subject of the merger of Web and OS.  We continue. </li><li>  <b>Sites will die - only social networks will remain.</b>  I do not know how for you, but for me it has already become clear as day.  Today, the most popular are those sites that involve network technologies.  Blogs crowd out forums, magazines and newspapers die quietly, and articles even from authoritative publications are interesting to the reader only if they can be commented on.  Web 2.0 = Social networks.  And who does not agree with this equation - he lives yesterday.  In Web 3.0, social networks will die, but not immediately.  Want to argue?  In one of the following topics I will explain this idea in detail. </li><li>  <b>Kill the mouse.</b>  Sometimes I remember the case of acquaintance with a teacher of computer science.  At the very first lesson, he seriously dedicated us to the two commandments of Informatics: ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt mix the tail of Misha ... and I don‚Äôt grudge my hands on the keys.‚Äù  This wish to us very much amused the class.  But IT-sphere is not a place for nostalgia.  The mouse and the standard keyboard less and less meet the needs of the user.  And, sadly - the mouse must be destroyed.  Web 3.0 sites will focus on management, primarily using the touch panel (the screen itself is a tablet, smartphone, or a separate touch panel, or two touch panels).  The concept of a laptop for surfing on the Web 3.0 site is a laptop with two touch panels (or one touch panel and a conventional monitor): one performs the function of the screen, the second - the control panel.  Panel customizable.  You can call the keyboard, touchpad, make the panel a mirror screen, drag windows, drag icons into the panel and through the panel.  And I'm not talking about the distant future.  I am writing only about the technologies and concepts that will be involved in the next year or two.  Why don't I mention <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/143605/">Touch√©</a> technology and the like?  For the same reason.  Some technologies are ahead of the time and needs of people.  And such technologies will become relevant already within the framework of the concept of Web 4.0. </li><li>  <b>What is written on the fence.</b>  We all know the traction of young talents to donate their pearls on the walls and walls of residential (and non-residential) houses.  This is the syndrome of the ‚Äúancient artist‚Äù who didn‚Äôt have much freedom in creativity.  One of the few such freedoms is cave paintings.  And you know yourself - that water flows through a narrow pipe with a stronger pressure.  Well, enough of the story.  So, in the Web environment, the ‚Äúancient artist‚Äù syndrome manifests itself in an insatiable thirst for comments.  And the apogee of apotheosis - Wikipedia.  A site with the ability to edit <s>any</s> text ( <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/gtv/blog/140193/">"Truth in Numbers?"</a> ).  But what next?  Web 3.0 will offer you the ability to edit (add, delete, mark with a marker, leave a comment inside the text, after the text, insert an epigraph, change the name, correct mistakes, leave a message to the author) any text on any site (Web 3.0).  Naturally, these corrections and vandal assaults will be visible only to the author of the text, who will decide on the implementation of changes or blocking spam.  However, the most interesting and probably the most pleasant thing for some is the fact that all the changes will be saved for the one who made them, regardless of the desire of the author of the text.  So, some of them will have a clean fence, while others will have it written.  But it will be the same "fence". </li><li> <b>And you do not have the same, but without wings?</b>  You do not like the design of the site?  Are you tired of blue?  (it seems to me not to one that all designers are obsessed with blue?) Are you angry with sharp edges and straight lines?  In Web 3.0, this will not be a problem.  You can design an individual single design in which all sites will be displayed, or assign a separate design for each page or site.  Of course, for this you do not need to know HTML and CSS.  If you are not satisfied that the messages pop up in the lower left corner - you can select <s>any place</s> convenient for you.  Whether you need a hat or not - it's up to you!  Do you want everything in black, or white on white - please)).  Designers of course will not be delighted with such innovations.  To be honest - in the era of Web 3.0, we are waiting for you with the collapse of the labor market in the field of Web programming and Web design.  What will happen to the handicraft cobblers from the city of N, if a shoe factory is built in this city?  Only a part of them will be hired as workers, the rest will be retrained.  I will set forth my thoughts on this topic in detail later. </li><li>  <b>Friend and comrade</b>  The interface will be as friendly and customizable as possible.  And all this will happen automatically.  This is a contextual interface.  Web 3.0 will remember your choices, your tastes, and your interests.  You will be offered a program, taking into account your needs, the search will be customized to your needs.  All people are different.  One is easy to navigate in a web environment, the other is difficult.  One needs a design change function, while others do not need it at all.  This is the essence of the Web 3.0 interface - it is always the way you want it to be at the moment.  If you are not ready to use its capabilities, then it will do everything for you, but unnoticed. </li><li>  <b>But what about Web3D?</b>  These technologies already relate to the concept of Web 4.0.  The same goes for <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/141422/">Project Glass - Google's future glasses or ‚Äúfeel like a terminator‚Äù</a> , the <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/140750/">future glasses are already now</a> .  All this awaits us in the next evolutionary stage of the Web.  The evolutionary paradigm of the Web is expressed not in the sum of new technologies, but in the sum of the realized needs of the user by means of modern technologies.  Web evolution is an evolution of user interaction with the Internet technology.  And if it is possible to realize the qualitatively new needs of the user through the latest technologies, this will be a new round in evolution.  If we satisfy the ‚Äúold‚Äù needs by means of new technologies, this is also an evolution, but within the framework of the already existing paradigm.  More on this later. </li></ul><br>  There is an opinion that Web 3.0 will destroy the concept of confidentiality, fully reveal to the public the personal life of a person.  But I think this will not happen.  Web 3.0 on the contrary - will have the function of anonymity.  Advertising companies and special services will receive minimal information about you.  Web 3.0 will protect a person‚Äôs privacy.  Companies that will transfer data to "third parties" will not be popular.  But more about that in the next series.  And remember - the future will be what we want it to be and <b>to do</b> . <br><br>  Soon I promise to publish the sequel: <br><ol><li>  Semantic web </li><li>  Web 1 -&gt; Web 2 -&gt; Web 3 -&gt; Web 4 (history and consequences) </li><li>  Web 3.0 technologies </li><li>  The collapse of the web-based labor market </li><li>  Web os </li><li>  Intelligent web </li><li>  How to deal with copyright? </li><li>  Internet without advertising </li><li>  What will be the search? </li><li>  Status democracy and corporatocracy </li><li>  Electronic currency </li><li>  Social networks must die </li><li>  Anonymity </li><li>  <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/144433/">Who will own the Internet?</a> </li><li>  Web 5.0 - virtual reality or bio-processor? </li><li>  And much more... </li></ol><br>  Those topics will be published, in support of which readers will express themselves.  Hubs!  Add to the comment your wishes for the next publication.  Thank you for your patience. </div>
