Part 2</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  So, the second part of my story about moving to Germany (the <a href="http://megamozg.ru/post/10342/">first</a> ).  Sorry, if it seemed that he did not publish for a long time, but I had the installation to publish the second part after finding the apartment, and I moved into it a week ago. <br><br>  <i>Disclaimer: everything described in the article is purely my experience, in other lands and in general other people can have everything differently.</i> <br><br>  So, where are we ... <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h4>  Getting a visa </h4><br>  I got a contract and went to the embassy with the documents.  It was February 5, Thursday.  I was preparing to wait for 4 weeks, as they say in almost all the stories of tractor theft.  But I was given a visa in 2 days (in writing - TWO WORKING DAYS), and on Monday I took the passport for sighting.  The secret of such a quick solution turned out to be simple: comrade <a href="https://megamozg.ru/users/drcolombo/" class="user_link">drcolombo</a> advised to write in the column ‚ÄúEstimated date of entry‚Äù - ab Sofort, which means ‚Äúas soon as, so immediately‚Äù.  If I had written the date of the commencement of the contract, I would have given it 2-3 days before this date, as happened with my friend, although she was going to study.

    <h4>  Moving </h4><br>  There is nothing special to tell here - I collected monatki, friends, drank bitter, snot-tears, and here I am in Munich.  In this paragraph, I can only note that it is better to ask to send you all the invoices from the airlines for tickets and transportation of things in English.  My company compensated me a certain amount for the move, but Aeroflot sent me a route receipt in Russian and refused to send it in English after the flight.  Therefore, the flight I could not compensate for the Russian language in the document. <br><br><h4>  The first steps </h4><br>  Everything that happens next, everyone is about the same (except that those who move with the family may have something extra, but you still need to do all this).  However, I repeat and describe what I did. <br><br><h5>  Registration at the place of stay </h5><br>  The very first and most important piece of paper that you need, without it you will not do any of the further steps.  The point here is not to attach you to a particular place, but, as I understand it, to distribute taxes across different lands and stuff like that.  I had a question about this, and for some reason no one could answer me about it - do I need a contract for rental housing.  The answer is no, just come with your passport and fill out the form.  In Munich, in the departments on Orleans-Strasse 50 and Ruppert-Strasse 19 more or less speak English and the form also exists in English.  The queues are big, but the thing is that to be the first, you have to come 40-50 minutes before the opening - you will spend exactly the same amount of time in the queue if you come later.  Keep the original of this piece of paper carefully at home, a copy will be enough for everyone (except ABC). <br><br><h5>  Opening a bank account </h5><br>  Here you can choose a bank where to receive a salary, but I trusted our HRC and she told me that without a long-term visa, it is not always the case that an account is created and a salary must be received.  Therefore, I have chosen Stadtsparkasse M√ºnchen so far - I have heard a lot of negative things about them (according to my feelings - this is something like the local Sberbank), but I haven‚Äôt come across anything like that yet.  An important point: here you will need a piece of paper from paragraph 1, but most likely they won't immediately open an account for you, but will only schedule a reception somewhere in a week, so you can go to the bank on the very first day, even before registration. <br><br><h5>  Medical insurance </h5><br>  Again, at work, almost everyone uses insurance Techniker Krakenkasse, so I just filled out a form and sent it to insurance (by email). <br><br><h5>  Tax number, social insurance, pension insurance </h5><br>  When you first register, you put a tick that you need to have all this and then everything comes to you by mail, no need to go anywhere. <br><br><h5>  Ausl√§nderbeh√∂rde </h5><br>  The name familiar to many, in the common people of "ABH" - here it is necessary to go for their residence permit, it is the "Blue Card".  You can <a href="http://www.muenchen.de/rathaus/Stadtverwaltung/Kreisverwaltungsreferat/Auslaenderwesen/Terminvereinbarung-.html">write a letter</a> to a special email for applicants for the Card and you will be assigned a reception.  I was appointed literally in a week.  All your documents are already there (sent from the embassy), with me only a passport, a photo and a completed form (I had attachments to the letter).  Now, in Munich, Blue Cards as such are not issued because of a large number of people, you are simply stuck in a passport with something similar to a visa, but in fact it is a Card (for the duration of the contract; if it is unlimited - for 4 years).  In Munich, come in advance for 20 minutes, because to find where you need is not so easy.  This, however, did not help me. <br><br>  I arrived somewhere in 30 minutes, walked over to the lady at the service point and said that I had an appointment.  She took my passport and said: "Stand in a queue."  I: "Here, look, I have an invitation to 10:30."  She: "Stand in line."  The line is not very big, but it moves extremely slowly - there are 2 aunts sitting there, about 15 minutes per person.  I spent about 2.5 hours there.  And when my turn came, this lady said to me: ‚ÄúMister, why did you not come to the meeting?  You are scheduled for 09:30. ‚Äù  I said: ‚ÄúNo, I wrote 10:30 (I show the letter on the phone), and you told me to stand in the queue ...‚Äù.  "No, the meeting is at 09:30 (shows the screen), and for today the reception is over, come next time."  The casket just opened - I was booked for an appointment before daylight saving time, and the reception itself was after.  Well, then came a week later, half an hour before the opening, was second and did everything quickly. <br><br><h5>  Search for your home </h5><br>  It is pain and suffering for all who come to Munich.  For all.  Do not hope that you are lucky and immediately get ready for a long search.  Accommodation for the first time I was provided by the company, so I was not very worried about finding a hotel or a room.  But so far from everywhere.  In Munich, there are 2 search options - furnished apartment on MrLodge and unfurnished on ImmobilienScout24.  The first is more expensive, but almost without problems, the second is cheaper, but very difficult to remove.  I tried to contact the owners on the second site a couple of times, but it‚Äôs really very difficult if you don‚Äôt know the language and have just arrived - you need to ask someone to talk for you.  And then the difficulty is that the landlord chooses you.  I tried a couple of times and decided to pay more, but without any of these hemorrhoids, I will take off cheaper in a year.  Since I was not strongly driven by anything, I was looking for an apartment not far from work (formally there is no limit on how much to live in the company's apartment, but there are quite a few who want it, so the informal maximum period is 2 months).  I found a very good option, 15 minutes walk from work, on the 12th floor, 25 square meters.  with a great view of the park and the city center in the background (here, tall houses are a very big rarity within a radius of kilometers 5 from the center).  All together with utility payments and the Internet (20 Mbps) costs ‚Ç¨ 750 per month.  Peculiarities of pricing and how much you will have to pay initially at the time of the shooting will not describe, it‚Äôs all individually, but get ready to roll off immediately 4 thousand in the first month. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/7d8/73a/ca0/7d873aca07c2489dadc2f62f60a97055.JPG"><br>  <a href="">A little more</a> <br><br>  So far, probably, this is all that I would like to share.  Perhaps there will be a third part after the trial period (ends September 16), already on the sensations and differences from work in Russia.  Now it is difficult for me to formulate my thoughts on this matter into something concrete. <br><br>  Thanks for attention! </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/290442/">https://habr.com/ru/post/290442/</a></p>
