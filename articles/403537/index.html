      <b>Smart yacht Ak-Bars from the company "SM Tech"</b> .  Glass with adjustable transparency, motorized furniture and AV control.  Flash quickly, but they are. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/nQk4uJPBWV4" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  Description from the integrator: <br><blockquote>  <b>How the task sounded:</b> <br>  Integration of a complete automation system on board a private yacht <br><br>  <b>Description:</b> <br>  The company SM-TECH implemented a project to integrate a complete automation system onboard a private three-deck yacht 35.6 m long and 6.9 m wide. Within the project, an individual interface was developed on the iRidium mobile platform.  The developed interface allows you to conveniently and comfortably manage various functions of engineering and multimedia systems of the vessel, namely: integrated audio and video management of multiroom yacht systems, smart glass management, various motorized controls (curtain drives, table lifting mechanisms, TV), lighting system control.  The logical scenarios inherent in the project have reduced the number of switches, reduced energy consumption and, in general, improved the comfortable atmosphere.  A feature of the project was the integration of the geolocation system, which made it possible to quickly accurately obtain information about the current position of the vessel on the satellite map. <br><br>  <b>Difficulties:</b> <br>  The main difficulties in working on the project were the remoteness of the object (Kazan) and extremely tight deadlines. </blockquote><br><br>  <b>Smart ship BUSMA from the company Infodom</b> .  Here, control from the iPad is even in the cabin of the captain, everything seems to be displayed on the interface, even the level of fecal water: <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/cLCKSx_O4QY" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br>  Description from the integrator: <br><br><blockquote>  <b>How the task was set</b> : <br>  Development and installation of the following systems: <br>  - MISS (‚ÄúSmart Home‚Äù system, including 75 lighting zones, 16 zones of shipboard equipment, 84 control zones, integration of the fire protection system, climate control systems, etc.); <br>  - video surveillance (6 zones); <br>  - local network and LTTE Internet access; <br>  - marine satellite television; <br>  - fire protection system; <br>  - Multimedia system (more than 100 settings objects, including 2 home theaters, karaoke room). <br>  It includes: functional projects, circuit design projects, cabling, specifications and installation parameters (settings), scenario projects, load tables, design of SMM installations, etc. <br><br>  Programming ACS, development of scenarios and control sequences. <br><br>  Development of graphic design of control panels (for all zones of control of the ship, light zones, climate zones, video surveillance, positioning, navigation, etc.) and their programming on the Iridium Mobile platform (more than 250 tokens). <br>  The interface is as clear as possible for the captain and staff. <br>  Mandatory conditions: <br>  - control of all lighting on the ship; <br>  - climate control equipment; <br>  - temperature measurement in all compartments and display on control panels; <br>  - monitoring readings from instruments and devices of the vessel with the display on the control panel; <br>  - display of scenario events on the control panel, notification; <br>  - mapping of the state of security systems, including fire protection; <br>  - Video surveillance on control panels. <br><br>  <b>System:</b> <br>  Comfort-oriented automated system for three-deck houseboat LH-111.  Includes iRidium-based and HDL Buspro automated control systems (internal, deck, external lighting, ventilation, air conditioning, monitoring of ship systems, warning system), internal and external video surveillance systems, Internet access and satellite television, multimedia systems (TV, audio, karaoke etc.), navigation system, security system (leaks on the holds, smoke, fire, critical values ‚Äã‚Äãof shipboard equipment, monitoring of the filling of bilge tanks, etc.). <br><br>  <b>Includes equipment:</b> <br>  more than 100 pieces of automation equipment (gateways, input / output modules, relay and dimmer modules, dry contact modules, DIN controllers, DMX controllers and drivers, LED drivers, sensors (motion, presence, temperature, light, smoke), IR receivers and transmitters, control panels, power supplies, IP cameras, video recorder, switches, Wi-Fi access points, 4G modem, multiswitches, satellite marine antenna, multimedia equipment (there are a lot of things in general - from speakers to home theater receivers)); <br>  more than 150 control points; <br>  more than 100 executive devices; <br>  more than 70 different sensors; <br>  75 lighting zones in 35 rooms; <br>  more than 200 management scenarios. <br><br>  <b>Difficulties:</b> <br>  The specifics and requirements of the ship operation, which was reflected in the design process, and especially during the installation phase.  Adaptation (sometimes even simplification) of the interface of control panels to the requirements of operation on ships (captain, ship administrator). </blockquote><br><br>  This is not Fotinii, of course, made in the Russian Federation, but in my opinion it‚Äôs still super.  Which is better? </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/403537/">https://habr.com/ru/post/403537/</a></p>
