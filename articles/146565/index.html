Most recently, one of the users shared <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/145911/">his experience</a> , and the experience was very sad.  At that moment, I was just waiting for the map, and hoped that I would not face the same difficulties. <br><br>  The post is not paid, I know about the inadequacy of Tinkov in social networks.  I would like to convince some users that the Yandex.Money card is not so bad.

      In this post I would like to talk about my experience, as well as about the experience of my friend - <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/users/Klimenko/">Vadim</a> .  My name is Sadikh, I use the card in Russia, Vadim - in Ukraine.  Both would not be authenticated users.  Well, back to the topic. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h4>  Delivery </h4><br>  And so, first I will tell you how I had it.  The map was supposed to come to the city of St. Petersburg. <br>  June 2 - ordered a card, filled out the data and paid for (remember, for Russia - 99 rubles) <br>  June 5 - Russian Post received a letter with a card (Yandex sent me a tracking code that was not recognized for a couple of days) <br>  June 22 - the card came (the mail seal shows so) <br>  June 23 - tracking has been updated at last <br>  June 25th - in the evening I received a letter notice. <br>  June 26 - in the morning, hoping that I will not get into the queue.  I filled out a notice, went to pick up my card. <br><br>  I think you shouldn‚Äôt say how long the letter from Moscow to St. Petersburg still reaches.  When I arrived at my post office in the morning, I waited at least another hour.  Only one window worked, there were two people in front of me, and as my turn came - a break, they left for lunch.  However, as I gave the notice, I received a letter and went home. <br><br>  My friend Vadim ordered a card to Ukraine, to the city of Zaporozhye. <br>  June 12 - ordered a card <br>  June 16 - tracking earned <br>  June 26 - he took the card <br><br>  I was surprised that the letter came to Zaporozhye faster than to St. Petersburg. <br><br><h4>  Letter </h4><br>  And so, with delivery already decided.  We turn to our map.  On the front side of the envelope is the Yandex.Money logo, and on the back is the TKS stamp. <br><br>  Front side: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/afc/ca0/e49/afcca0e49595bfdd191bc4f93a9b0b49.jpg"><br>  Inside the envelope we are waiting for a booklet with a welcome message, and the card itself: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/f59/b13/05b/f59b1305bdb924262f985fab08141c3e.jpg"><br><br><br>  Actually everything is with paperwork. <br><br>  I really didn‚Äôt like the way they stuck the card.  Glue whether such, or a lot of it, but the card was strongly glued.  I was already afraid to break it while peeling it off.  As a result, I peeled off, but the glue remained on the card and had to scrape it off. <br><br>  However, my friend Vadim with glue was fine - it was easy to peel off :-) I read on Twitter at <a href="http://twitter.com/yamoneynews">@yamoneynews</a> , and it turned out that I am not the only one. <br><br><h4>  About the map </h4><br>  Go ahead.  We got the map, opened it.  Now you need to activate it.  I went to Yandex, activated it, and I received a text message from the TKS (!) About the card activation on my mobile. <br><br>  Next, you need to put another signature (otherwise the card is invalid).  I don‚Äôt know if my pens are bad or something else, but I couldn‚Äôt adequately sign a signature (the problem would seem to be out of nothing).  Only a couple of days ago, I was finally able to put a signature with the same pens.  Vadim solved this problem in a different way - he signed it with a thin marker :-) <br><br>  I still have a VISA card from Sberbank and QIWI - there were no such problems with the signature. <br><br>  MasterCard Gold card itself.  The frontal part can be seen on the booklet above, the back part is unremarkable - except for the small TKS logo.  Consider this as a regular MasterCard Gold card.  The limits <a href="">are the same</a> as for payments from Yandex.  Wallet <br><br><h4>  Getting a PIN </h4><br>  I decided to immediately get a pin to the card.  About this in more detail.  Pin can be received by any user, whether you are identified or not.  Identification is needed only for withdrawing money from an ATM. <br><br>  I called the number specified in the <a href="">FAQ</a> , waited 10 seconds for the operator, the TCS employee answered, asked for the full name, and the code word.  He asked me to wait a minute and switched to a robot.  The robot dictated the code and asked to press "1" or say "yes" if I understood everything.  And he did. <br><br>  There is one moment.  The robot said that if you forget the PIN code, the PIN code can only be restored by re-issuing the card.  This moment is a little sad - and if I want to change?  For the pin code issued can be in the form of XYYX, for example. <br><br>  By the way, about the call.  The same <a href="">FAQ</a> says that you need to call from the main number, for Russia the number is at <nobr>8-800,</nobr> for other countries - to the Moscow number (+ 7 495). <br><br>  I think everyone heard that often calls to <nobr>8-800</nobr> numbers <nobr>are free.</nobr>  I looked in Google, in some places people wrote that not all <nobr>8-800</nobr> numbers <nobr>are</nobr> free.  I decided not to guess, I called the operator (I have Tele2) and clarified.  Tele2 <nobr>has</nobr> a free call to all numbers <nobr>8-800</nobr> . <br><br>  Vadim also called the Moscow number with Skype, and then they called him on his mobile and solved the issue with a PIN code. <br><br><h4>  Card in </h4><br>  Immediately after I activated the card, I decided to check it out.  In the vicinity, there was only Pyaterochka and the office of Sberbank, where they accepted plastic cards.  I live in the Primorsky District, in the North-West region of St. Petersburg (not in the region), so far there are few shopping centers and there are few cards accepted. <br><br>  Nevertheless, I went to ‚ÄúPyaterochka‚Äù, took everything I needed at the cashier.  At that time, the signature was not on the card.  The purchase was for a small amount - <nobr>100-200 rubles.</nobr>  The cashier looked at the card, she was about to give her the PIN code, and now ... the answer came from the bank, the money was written off without a PIN code.  Got a check and left.  Signed not set.  And so it was a couple of times :) <br><br>  Since I am not identified, I did not even try to withdraw money. <br><br><h4>  What is common with TCS? </h4><br>  I wondered what my card has in common with TKS.  In addition, a text message about activation came from TKS.  Yes, the bank issuer is considered TKS. <br><br>  But even here everything was ambiguous.  TKS has <a href="https://www.tcsbank.ru/authentication/">Internet banking</a> , I asked Yandex.Money support, ‚ÄúCan I use it?‚Äù Before receiving the card, to which I received the answer ‚Äúno‚Äù.  However, my friend Vadim was able to log into the Internet banking of TKS, I also tried, but after registering I was awaited the answer ‚Äúdisabled‚Äù or something like that.  Clarify no longer. <br><br>  The limits for withdrawing money from the TKS do not apply to a card issued by Yandex.Money. <br><br><h4>  Notifications </h4><br>  Yandex.Money has <a href="">SMS informing</a> .  There is also a free email notification.  I don‚Äôt know if you need an sms-notification at all (it can only send a code when making payments to a number, not to mail), but I‚Äôve connected it.  But there was a problem. <br><br>  He pointed out everything, clicked on "pay" and waited 5 minutes, if not more, until "Yandex gets a response from the store."  After 5 minutes, he gave me an error.  Money is not written off.  Three times in a row I tried, there was an error with the message: <br><br><blockquote>  Mistake <br><br>  Oh!  Something went wrong. <br>  Check if your account balance has changed.  If it was possible to pay, the payment record will appear in History in the next 30 minutes.  If there is no record, and the money is withdrawn from the account, the support service will help you. </blockquote><br><br>  Or this: <br><br><blockquote>  Mistake <br>  A technical error.  Please contact support with the error number: 0033. </blockquote><br><br>  For the fourth time it happened.  Where I, everywhere bugs, I'm not surprised.  In general - this is a typical problem, do not worry. <br><br><h4>  Off topic </h4><br>  Now about those things for which I did not select a separate title. <br><br>  - Yandex.Money card is easily linked to Paypal or QIWI wallet. <br>  - According to Yandex.Money support, the card is set up so that the PIN code is not required, but some stores are allowed to pay only with the input of a PIN code.  Priority is paid without a pin code. <br>  - Yandex.Money support works quite well.  I came across different departments of Yandex (mail, search, etc.), but Yandex.Money technical support responds fairly quickly and clearly.  When I found out the details of the card before it was received, the support responded within 15 minutes.  Seriously. <br>  - I have not tried to replenish Yandex.Money from QIWI wallet with MoneySend transfer, but in theory it should work, and the time period for receipt of money is up to <nobr>2</nobr> days. <br>  - It is possible to replenish QIWI wallet from an attached Yandex.Money card to QIWI instantly. <br>  - Yandex.Money card can be obtained without problems, even if you are a minor, the main thing is to have a passport.  But problems may arise with identification (the presence of one of the parents is required, which is why I am not identified yet :-)) <br><br>  By the way, it would be better to send by registered mail, as QIWI does with its QVP.  Then, if there were fewer problems, the registered letters in the special window are issued, there is no queue :-) <br><br>  It seems to have forgotten nothing.  There will be questions - ask, maybe as a user I can answer. <br><br>  PS I do not know how to properly incline Yandex.Money, and also not sure what I placed in the right hubs. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/146565/">https://habr.com/ru/post/146565/</a></p>
