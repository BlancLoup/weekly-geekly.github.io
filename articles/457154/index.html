I don't need some functions, others I use more often.  But for some reason we equalize one size fits all, so that by a little bit, but to please more people.  A little further in terms of personalization went news feeds and social.  networks that provide unique content to everyone. <br><br>  But what if you go even further and, in addition to content, provide people with a personalized UI ?! <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h2>  Theory </h2><br>  <b>Concept</b> <br><br><ol><li>  The application itself understands what you often use and brings the frequently used functionality to the first screen. </li><li>  Places items in order of importance on the page so that you would not need to reach out with your thumb. </li><li>  Depending on how often this element is used, its content will also be very different. </li><li>  There are also triggers: a push notification has arrived, a specific date or user action.  This trigger has its own specific gravity, which is assigned to an individual element for a short time. </li></ol><br>  <b>Logics</b>

      <b>Calibration phase</b> <br><br>  The person uses the application. <br><br>  And the program itself analyzes the number of clicks on each element and gives the unit a specific weight. <br><br>  <b>Smooth implementation phase</b> <br><br>  After the initial calibration, we can carefully deploy the most popular request to the main page, in a separate block. <br><br>  <b>Item Verification Stage</b> <br><br>  We analyze the frequency of visits and determine whether an element is worthy of staying on the main page. <br><br>  And if it is worthy and it is used often, then we consider the option of expanding this cell, so that the user performs the target action even faster. <br><br><h2>  Practice </h2><br>  <b>Application implementation example</b> <br><br>  A good example is banking applications. <br><br>  Why? <br><br><ol><li>  They are multifunctional </li><li>  As a user, I don‚Äôt need most of the functions, but they may be more important to others </li><li>  Some of the functions may be needed only at some point. </li><li>  Everyone uses these applications, so it‚Äôs easier to understand the concept </li></ol><br>  Here I will try to show at the stage of sketches as I see it should be.  If the post is interesting, then I will already make a demo application on iOS. <br><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Rude application exiz</b> <div class="spoiler_text"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/nz/ph/o6/nzpho6xekjabhoqmp3ywsoxjimo.jpeg"><br></div></div><br>  <b>Scenarios</b> <br><br>  Each person has their own scripts that he performs.  They are not always logical, and the task of the application is to make it easier to achieve this goal. <br><br>  <b>Scenario 1</b> : I often transfer money to the same person (younger brother, child, wife). <br><br>  We can add a block with the ability to quickly translate it to him. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/cl/pz/ny/clpzny5c_t9iel1i9-vftoc29he.png"><br><br>  But the block itself can evolve like Pokemon.  If we see that they are often used. <br><br>  Level 2 block: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/h0/-6/o4/h0-6o4uzn_s4lgmprt2kkmrsbqg.png"><br><br>  Here we can translate directly from the cell itself by clicking on the translate button <br><br>  The application understands that this function is not only used often, but also the amount is the same, so we go further and change the cell so that the default amount is set for this operation. <br><br>  Level 3 block <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/f5/xc/-m/f5xc-mns725i7uhtehbm1glcomc.png"><br><br>  <b>Scenario 2</b> Once a month I pay for an apartment, here the date trigger works. <br>  The application understands that approximately this number every month I give money for an apartment. <br>  And it is logical for us to show this particular block on that day on the main screen and remove it after making the payment. <br><br>  <b>Scenario 3</b> Close the loan after receiving the RFP. <br><br>  Trigger.  I got a sn on the card and the application understands that usually after this action for a day or two I close the loan that hangs on me. <br><br>  The payment now appears in the block. <br><br>  <b>Scenario 4 I</b> use chat with support <br><br>  Often, if we correspond in chat with support, then this process is not fast, we can turn off the application several times, go about our business and come back later, so we can communicate with the chat, take it to the first screen.  As we know when he started the conversation and when, in principle, he solved the problem. <br><br>  <b>Scenario 5 I</b> withdraw money from the current account to the card <br><br>  A trigger triggers the receipt of money p / s, and I suppose we always distribute them among my cards: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/_i/hn/rf/_ihnrfk9uqiw00xu3iz5dz3k2pu.png"><br><br>  I wanted to convey the idea that the user experience can be improved by trying to help him accomplish what he wants as quickly as possible, of course it will be more difficult for us as developers, but this will be appreciated by our customers.  Tell me, what do you think about this approach? </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/457154/">https://habr.com/ru/post/457154/</a></p>
