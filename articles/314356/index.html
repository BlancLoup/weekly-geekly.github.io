I pass by and I hear it "mocking me."  So sweetly this ‚Äúaaaaaaa‚Äù is so fragile, so overwhelmed by the languishing body of her well-coordinated body, that no one else has any doubts - she wants to be mocked.  She approves and craves it. <a name="habracut"></a>

      <b>People love bullying.</b>  <b>It is strange that the user experience specialists have forgotten about it.</b>  <b>People tend to enjoy muscle fatigue, bright emotions of fear, or just the feeling of pain.</b>  <b>Without bullying, the palette of life colors would be incomplete and very fresh.</b> <br><br>  But when developing the next interface, we all suddenly keep on repeating like a wound up: a <i>simple and convenient interface, pleasant colors, a feeling of comfort and bliss when interacting and a half nap at the final stage of the user script ...</i> <br><br>  Is it all about us, about living people?  We are ready to exchange this endless sweetness in the mouth for the conquest of Everest and for the discovery of new continents, for the struggle with ourselves and with all the injustices in the world, for daily overcoming of ourselves and a sense of pride in front of our children? <br><br>  Well, no, we are not.  After all, we are still alive. <br><br>  Gamification remains a small loophole through which, as it turns out, it is still permissible to make the interface not too simple and pleasant - but especially for fun.  For the sake of achieving some imaginary goal, in order to get another progress - sometimes, in some places, it is still permissible to gently torment your user.  But so far only in games.  And nowhere else. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/5ae/5d3/a2d/5ae5d3a2d0becf0215bea008acb78f00.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Our whole life is a game.  All his life from birth to the grave, a person sets imaginary goals: to stand on two legs, get the top five at school, start a family, make a career, wait for your turn in the clinic - these are all the same game goals. <br><br>  Going to that through sweat and blood, through torment and bullying - man becomes Man, he grows and develops, opening new opportunities and frontiers.  Is it necessary to divide the virtual universe into games and non-games, is it worth creating imaginary boundaries of interface genres in the stream of the life of an ordinary person?  I am convinced that no.  And the matter is not at all in the target audiences: to struggle and win, to make discoveries and to fail, the same excite schoolchildren and pensioners, men and women, hipsters and hard workers.  The difference is only in the desired goals, but not in the chemical composition of endorphins, obtained by understanding what kind of bullying just managed to overcome and get out alive and stronger. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/763/fd3/512/763fd3512b56cc2566019c2f65359131.jpg" alt="image"></div><br>  But, unfortunately, for the time being, the thick-skinnedness of marketers and designers, designers and productologists is depressed when it comes to immersion in the enjoyment of human pain.  Here is a case in point - the Pure application, a long-term and competitively-sought-after designer who perfectly illustrates human lust and passion, violence and vmuk lust, human pain and ecstasy at the same time.  A year has passed, the application has been updated and more than once - and what do we see?  Has it caused pain and anguish of its target audience at least at the level of the GosSlug portal? <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/c02/c71/764/c02c717642a6d5d03a95bfd81ed7f366.jpg" alt="image"></div><br>  Alas: <s>black bottom, white top</s> , that is, forgive me: black background and red hearts.  What is missing is a velvet curtain and women in a mask with feathers - to collect all the most ridiculous stereotypes of the genre at once. <br><br>  Not a single whip or a handcuff, not a single scar, not an animation for you in the form of putting a slave mask on your interlocutor, nothing that would show sex like this - what it is in life.  And in life, sex is always close to violence, close to power, close to pain, close to rebellion against the morality and convention of the gray majority.  But nothing more "gray" than red hearts - is simply impossible to imagine. <br><br>  No, guys, in this format, so far even an online record in a typical clinic is much more a site about sex and prohibitions, about irrepressible desire and endless delaying of the final ecstasy.  While recording your child to the right specialist is much more gamification than catching Pokemon.  Learn and learn from the best again! <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/df6/fee/779/df6fee77902d742d5234fdf3af07cf75.jpg" alt="image"></div><br>  And why did everyone suddenly decide that whipping their user is a priori bad, and light breathing in the ear through the earpiece is the pinnacle of vulgarity and indecency?  Sometimes it seems that only old communist grandfathers, who have never seen a single pornographic film, go to work in IT. <br><br>  The human psyche is much more multifaceted and it is always ready to adapt to changing conditions of reality.  So man has survived and evolved for millions of years, adjusting his own system of values ‚Äã‚Äãand ways of enjoying to the changing rules of the game, weather conditions, available technical capabilities. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/b94/46f/18b/b9446f18b189668770c8379a38bb8ffa.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  <b>A person has adapted himself for thousands of years not to now adapt the interface for him.</b>  <b>This is not the norm.</b> <br><br>  Make him feel again the taste of life and the threat from natural incomprehensible forces, give him the opportunity to give you pleasure (and not just get yourself), make him learn new skills and sensations.  Most people are far from alpha males in their original potential - and that means the pleasure of submission, admiration and adoration of someone else's power - is our main feature (look at least at the "Epplosexuals"). <br><br>  Yes, it will turn out to think in a new way not immediately and not at all.  The main thing that I have determined for myself so far is to clearly set my final goal, with the promise of getting a dose of pleasure at the finish line.  It should be given a very prominent and foreseeable task, for which a person will agree to endure the torture of inventing a password longer than 8 characters or manually entering your zip code (which no one will ever remember by memory).  For example, there should no longer be vulgar and formal promises from the site manager "Call back and clarify within an hour."  Where is the buzz?  For the sake of which I endured this torture for the last half hour, comprehending your website - certainly not for the sake of a dry clerical ‚Äúchime‚Äù. <br><br>  <i>‚ÄúYou have just been tormented for 35 seconds filling out our delivery form.</i>  <i>Oh, we all know about the strength of this unbearable pain, but now our best employee Vernochnika is already trembling, anticipating you for a future dialogue.</i>  <i>If you agree to her little whims in the form of a prepayment, then she will break the last covers of decency from herself and allow you free delivery to any, absolutely any address in Moscow.</i>  <i>Yes, it will be our loss, but she is too bad a girl.</i>  <i>And you will be convinced of it very soon ... "</i> <br><br>  Why not?  What prevents?  Do not even try?  Just because we are all 90 years old and we never watch porn? <br><br>  Well, go ahead - such a lively and simple couple of lovers will not be bullied today.  Just do not know how.  So far too much evangelism and missionaries seem to be. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/314356/">https://habr.com/ru/post/314356/</a></p>
