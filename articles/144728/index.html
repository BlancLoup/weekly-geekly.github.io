    <h4>  Personal experience </h4><br>  Recently, I wanted to install a program that I once bought and then demolished.  I opened the Mac App Store, got into Purchases and found a pristine clean list. <br><br>  Naturally, I immediately wrote to Apple support. <br>  I had to correspond for several days, since I was sent standard answers, and I had more than 12 hours time difference with Cupertino.  From the very beginning, the passages about how they understand me, how sorry they are, etc. began to annoy.  It was the presence of these apologies that irritated each letter.  Here is a small example: <br><blockquote>  Dear Alexey, <br><br>  I would like to be the same way.  It is the most important thing to do. <br><br>  For me to help you, I‚Äôm trying to update.  You need to provide a speedy service. <br><br>  Thank you for your continued patronage to iTunes Store Support.  Have a great day. <br></blockquote><br><br>  Well, nothing, after 5 letters I said that I was tired of their standard answers and I want to talk to the person.  I was quickly transferred to the Senior Advisor, and then to the second.  As a result, the result shocked me a little: <br><br><blockquote>  Hello Alexey, <br><br>  Kimberly, here from the iTunes Store.  I am still a senior advisor.  I feel so sorry for you.  <b>The App Stores The App.</b>  I understand your frustration. <br>  It‚Äôs not always the same way that you‚Äôve made it in the United States Store.  It is your choice. <br></blockquote><br>  <i>Unfortunately, the content in iTunes, the App Store and the Mac App Store is tied to a country and when you change countries, in most cases [purchased] content will not work in a new country.</i> <br><br>  Of course, Kimberly got a little overwhelmed, applications are working, updates are being installed, but you will not be able to install the application again (for example, on a new computer). <br>  I was not so upset, because I had purchases a maximum of $ 50-60, and most of the programs I have not taken down yet.  At the moment I decided to buy from the developer sites, if this option is available. <br><br>  But, in connection with the upcoming update of Mountain Lion, and the fact that developers are simply being driven there in the Mac App Store, it becomes somewhat sad.  Since 2008, I moved 4 times from country to country, and I honestly don‚Äôt understand why I have to pay for software every time (and judging by the answer of support, this also applies to music from video). <br><br>  At the moment I see only one way out - to keep a special account for payment (Mac) App Store in one country.  But if you earn in Europe, and initially the link to the account / card was in Russia, then it is simply expensive - you need to constantly transfer money. <br>  Again, the amount of content available in Russia and the States / Europe is completely different.  And it is quite natural that when you move, you want to switch the App Store to a local one.  Therefore, even this option is not very successful. <br><br>  I hope my experience will help save money when moving to owners of Apple equipment. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/144728/">https://habr.com/ru/post/144728/</a></p>
