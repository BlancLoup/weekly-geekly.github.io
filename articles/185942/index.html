  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Highscreen Omega Prime XL - Russia's first chameleon smartphone</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  The line between smartphones and tablets is getting smaller: two years ago we couldn‚Äôt imagine a convenient phone with a screen larger than 4 inches and less than 7, and now five-inch phones are decisively pushing out, displacing both tiny and huge competitors.  In this army, there is Highscreen Omega Prime XL, which is the name (remember "Transformers"?) Obliges to go forward and if not to win, then fight with dignity.  As a secret weapon, the new smartphone has an interesting feature: three interchangeable rear panels of different colors are bundled with the device. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/9fb/7b1/d24/9fb7b1d2429e08825a26e319605b960e.jpg"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h4>  <b>Big or just right?</b> </h4><br>  Honestly, I don‚Äôt really like convergence, when one gadget replaces five at once.  But living with Omega Prime XL in your pocket turned out to be very convenient, unlike the long-forgotten 5-inch ‚Äúresmartphone‚Äù HTC Advantage on Windows Mobile, released in 2007 and puzzling most of the representatives of the IT-press and fans of the brand.  That is, attempts to create a sort of ‚Äúall-in-one‚Äù have been made for a long time, but the technology and, most importantly, the wishes of users have matured just now.  Actually, Highscreen, in 2010, also had an ‚Äúexperiment‚Äù on this topic - Highscreen Hippo. <br>  And even today, when discussing large smartphones, the ‚Äúinconvenient to hold‚Äù argument often sounds.  Some of those who have never seen such devices in their eyes say they will not fit in their hands.  Nonsense!  In the average female (and, of course, male) hand, the reader and even an 8-inch tablet easily fit, and they are certainly wider than the Omega Prime XL (78 mm from 110-120 in the average e-book). <br>  Other position: 5 inches and more is good, but a shovel near the ear is bad.  We all immediately recall the anecdote, about a girl who talked all summer long on the Samsung Galaxy Note II and did not get tanned :))))) However, I dare say that home radio and even more so wired telephones are not miniature at all, this is time.  The story moves in a spiral, and after minimization, the reverse process began, these are two.  The closer the microphone is to the mouth, the better the interlocutor hears you and the worse - background noise, these are three.  And all these alleged inconveniences pay off with a display on which even a movie is pleasant to watch - these are twenty-three. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/df2/e85/1ac/df2e851ac58b9ac6faeb73b8f2c8a647.jpg"><br><br><h4>  <b>Design</b> </h4><br>  The peculiarity of this model - removable panels included.  What the <s>Bolsheviks</s> have been talking about for so long <s>...</s> that is, the users partially happened: black and dark gray were replaced by white and bright yellow. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/6f8/cbc/437/6f8cbc437a046d69fdb95d4831b662d2.jpg"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/488/461/12e/48846112e6a2c9699eb72b6bc3720701.jpg"><br><br>  And it immediately made the seemingly masculine huge smartphone closer to the fair sex.  You can change the color of the back cover at least every day.  Girls, of course, comfortable.  I made a French manicure - I took a smartphone with a white panel (glossy, the rest are matte).  Only now the cover is not so easy to unscrew, so there is a risk to spoil your manicure ... <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/be3/24e/055/be324e0558c853b8d638bbf0258b0797.jpg"><br>  I bought a sun bag and lacquer in tone - I put on a yellow one. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/990/f85/cc2/990f85cc2d28a6b20d9b685652698ce9.jpg"><br>  Put on a little black dress - the smartphone ideally went with the dress. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/100/d71/281/100d71281d7e49b59259e58c8d1fe7d6.jpg">

      A little bit of beauty ... ;-) <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/905/edc/5c3/905edc5c362b2c711114ee624742515f.jpg"><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/f76/de8/6a6/f76de86a6c94119dd8c7cbae89388358.jpg"><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/802/023/b11/802023b11d8f5181c64eaefd118d8269.jpg"><br><br>  It remains to repaint the front panel also - and it will be quite good.  Only the warranty is likely to disappear, but beauty requires sacrifice :) <br><br>  The charger and headphones are white, perfect for a white cap.  True, the sound quality in the headphones will not satisfy the discerning audience, so there is a reason to buy black ones.  Well, or yellow, for greater harmony. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/0ef/c75/4cd/0efc754cd9fa9a2c383b6cf9c4a5e678.jpg"><br><br>  In his hand, despite the accusations of theorists, he lies well, does not jump out and does not creak when you squeeze.  This seems odd, considering the replacement panels, but speaks well of the build quality. <br><br>  There are few control elements on the case, and this is another trend of fashion. <br>  On the left - the volume button. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/d41/c6c/a63/d41c6ca63602e9e211dba0fb776fc380.jpg"><br>  Right - the button on and unlock the phone <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/f89/51a/82a/f8951a82ab45a4c576cb0192951e4c89.jpg"><br>  Headphone and recharging jacks are located on the top. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/ee2/163/4ad/ee21634ad42ca48caefd2da8dfc251a2.jpg"><br>  On the bottom emptiness ... <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/2a3/1f0/b1a/2a31f0b1a95ce73994e649ca9cd57e40.jpg"><br><br>  The buttons ‚ÄúMenu‚Äù, ‚ÄúHome‚Äù and ‚ÄúBack‚Äù, according to the tradition of the Highscreen brand, are placed under the display, so that all 5.3 inches, 960 x 540 pixels are at your disposal.  Resolution, of course, is not the highest modern and slightly upsetting.  But the test on three of my friends showed that ‚Äúyou know less - sleep better‚Äù.  They would not have noticed that the HD film looks imperfect if I did not say that the resolution is slightly lower than 1280 by 720 pixels.  Moreover, comparing this smartphone with one of the competitors, having 1280 x 720 (and the price is 5 000 rubles higher), two of the three respondents did not even notice the difference in pixel density, even though it exists.  In general, ‚Äúnot geeks‚Äù cannot be understood :) In general, the display is also good in viewing angles, although it is inverted a little vertically and in color reproduction.  Such a screen, of course, is somewhat cheaper than the ultramodern ones, and this allows you to save money during production in order to set a more pleasant price. <br><br><h4>  <b>What can</b> </h4><br>  The technical equipment of the smartphone is rather modest: a processor for four cores (from the American company Qualcomm, a world market leader), a frequency of 1.2 GHz, a gigabyte of RAM - all this we have already done last year.  But technogs, who need everything at once, don‚Äôt even look at the budget segment, and for ordinary tasks these megahertz and megabytes are more than enough.  The smartphone pulls HD movies (even if it‚Äôs not entirely clear why they should be watched on a standard resolution screen - except for connecting a big screen to a smartphone), most games, and there‚Äôs nothing to say about office documents, schedulers and multitasking in general.  The test copy turned out to be very efficient, did not turn off and did not refuse to install applications from Google Play. <br><br>  AnTuTu's performance test put the smartphone at 11,048 points, and he won even a competitor with a more powerful processor (that turned out to be better only by the screen resolution). <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/40a/437/480/40a437480657d0acab00e5d185d69e2f.jpg"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/df0/485/68e/df048568e1b85810ab49e1f90115e168.jpg"><br><br>  In addition, not the coolest processor has a plus: it requires not so much energy.  Therefore, a smartphone with a battery of 2,800 mAh lived with me for as long as three days without recharging, which is about an hour of active Internet (Wi-Fi was turned off only for the night), a dozen calls and photos, half an hour of games or videos per day.  Yes, if you do not get out of it from morning to evening, you will have to walk to the outlet daily, but with normal use, which most smartphones are exposed to, it lives much longer than the average. <br><br>  By the way, in Highscreen Omega Prime XL, according to the ‚ÄúHayskrinovskoy‚Äù tradition, two slots for SIM-cards, so it will be convenient to optimize the cost of communication or use two numbers in roaming.  Another thing would be to not get the battery when installing a SIM card or a microSD card - it would be absolutely good. <br><br>  Another facet of using a smartphone is a camera.  For me, the camera is one of the most important criteria by which I choose a smartphone, so it is important for me that the quality is straight ‚Äúwow!‚Äù And here, unfortunately, there is no such thing.  Yes, Omega Prime XL is equipped with an 8-megapixel camera with LED flash and autofocus, and for its price category it shoots quite well (and if it didn't work out very well, you can play with the settings).  But it is for the cost she can be forgiven. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/e95/66c/885/e9566c885b15ef39bf7f9996ee7df9ad.jpg"><br><br>  Here are examples of shooting in the house - a box with flash and without, a cat without flash. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/d4a/865/6eb/d4a8656eb14055908483926b6d3a8ed1.jpg"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/9c1/ad7/e02/9c1ad7e024bd1b7b6b4d11cf1209c489.jpg"><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/064/393/6ee/0643936ee4b52213e81cea0857a54983.jpg"><br><br>  An example of shooting outdoors in bright sunshine and standard settings: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/364/2a7/29d/3642a729ddbdbf3cc9678cfb86b2494c.jpg"><br><br>  The front 2 megapixel camera is perfect for Skype and now fashionable self portraits in the elevator, bathroom and on the beach. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/4cd/3e4/6fa/4cd3e46fa70a7e426e16409cc074b33e.jpg"><br><br><h4>  <b>Conclusion</b> </h4><br>  Today, it is customary to ask for more money for a large diagonal, but Highscreen played in the opposite direction: it saved a little here and there, and released such a smartphone for 10,990 rubles.  Adherents of the idea of ‚Äã‚Äã‚Äúnot overpaying for extra‚Äù now also have something to look at.  Omega Prime XL is not without flaws, but how serious they are - everyone decides for himself.  I personally did not particularly like the quality of the camera and the not quite simple removal of the back panel.  Some may not like the screen and not quite new TTX.  However, the 2,800 mAh battery allows the smartphone to live longer than a day, and the three interchangeable panels that Highscreen put in a box with a smartphone for free are generally unique to Russia.  The same Nokia, LG and Motorola sell extra backdrops for extra money. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/185942/">https://habr.com/ru/post/185942/</a></p>
