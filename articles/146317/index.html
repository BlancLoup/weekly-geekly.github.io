      There is a stereotype that the admin is a bearded uncle with a beer belly and he has <br>  There must be a black admin cat.  I'll tell you about my favorite admin, he is not at all like that. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  He is not bearded, sometimes unshaven, but this is only when the week was too busy. <br>  There is no beer belly, he loves rum more. <br>  Admin cat ..., no, not only that, a fluffy cat with claws that walks, rubs against you and asks to eat.  I love cats, but, strangely enough, we had no quarrels on this basis. <br>  We agreed on an exotic pet - the gecko. <br>  He sits quietly in the terrarium and catches the crickets when the hunting night comes.  Regarding the nickname, several options were proposed from the IT sphere, among <br>  which I chose the right one. <br><br>  Conversations at the table often boil down to one topic, where a loved one begins to talk about the latest trends in technology or some kind of workflow.  It is interesting to me to listen to him, and sometimes to give my vision of a solution to a problem.  I have a technical frame of mind, and I can get to the point, it becomes pleasant that I myself helped)) <br><br>  A creative mess in the room, many hours of hanging up at a computer to give birth to another project and then rejoice as a child that you created a bicycle, but YOUR bicycle, according to your sketches, is from YOUR materials, and he also went!))) At such moments I try do not interfere, only sometimes tear off to eat. <br><br>  Now I can sleep in the light of flashing LEDs and under the noise of a working server. <br>  It happens that the thought occurred to him, in an hour or two at night, I sleep, and he optimizes the system. <br><br>  It would seem that the Internet at home is conducted through a wifi, all the wires must be hidden somewhere.  No, the server is constantly spinning, spinning, there is a monitor next to it and a bunch of accompanying hardware in the form of a router, power supply, etc ... Cleaning at such moments is a terrible thing.  I pulled the wires out of the right slots a couple of times (it wasn't Me (wasntme)) <br><br>  I found out who Linux is and what to eat with it, once I opened a laptop, where, instead of the usual Windows, I started loading debian, or ubunt (I still confuse which of them is who). <br>  A screen appeared, but for some reason there was no START button, where to click, what to see, how to get out of here ... ooo!  panic!.. <br>  Now, no problem, you need to install some program, go to google looking for an analogue under Linux and install it (note: sudo yum install tra-yat guy-sysadmin, and yes, I have Fedora).  Works!!!  I am quietly happy inside, and my admin is proud of me and boasts))) I did not set it up myself, although it says that it is not difficult, but there is no time to sit down and figure it out. <br>  Now I know what a console is and how to find and open the necessary file through it.  Sometimes it brings a working laptop home and opens a dozen consoles on the desktop, says it‚Äôs more convenient and faster to work.  He taught to raise a virtual machine and work in it, because  for work you need AutoCAD, E3 and other programmers. <br><br>  Sometimes we gather with ITshniki friends and suddenly there comes a time when you start to understand poorly what their speech is about, it only saves that they come with their girls and we chat about ours) <br>  But I like such training, it is always interesting to listen to their stories, their non-standard jokes. <br><br>  I love my admin!  Although we live not so long ago, and he warned me that there would be a lot of wires and equipment at home, but there was never a dispute about this.  Yes, and in general, we live together, feed our lizard together, watch TV shows in the evenings, ride our horses, meet friends (Hello Programmer and Humanities :)), play games and go on vacation ... we lead active lifestyles. <br>  And among friends, not only IT specialists and techies, there are a lot of humanities. <br>  You just need to be an interesting and positive person and no matter what your mindset. <br><br>  PS: Respect to all IT guys, you guys are great! </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/146317/">https://habr.com/ru/post/146317/</a></p>
