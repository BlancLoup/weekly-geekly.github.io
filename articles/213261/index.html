This CodeFest will be jubilee, the fifth, so prepare rhymes, toasts and gifts - we will have a splash! <a name="habracut"></a></div></div><br><br><h2>  CodeFest No. 1 - very regional </h2><br>  It was in <a href="http://2010.codefest.ru/program/%3Futm_source%3Dnews%26utm_medium%3Dhabr%26utm_campaign%3Dpost_tort">2010</a> .  We were young, green and enthusiastic.  In those days, not much was known about Novosibirsk.  Mostly in the top of spontaneous fame with the word "Novosibirsk" were bears with matryoshkas and rumors of harsh engineers, entrenched in the basements of Akademgorodok. <br><br>  And of course, these rumors inevitably gave rise to legends both about the appearance of the engineers, and about the unruly parties of these harsh guys. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/fa3/5a6/617/fa35a6617e9a1d2ff9c3d87f41dcb5a9.jpg"><br><br>  Of course, we wanted to act as destroyers of legends and create a platform within which to unite the Siberian IT crowd, to look at others and to show ourselves.  And it seems the experiment was a success. <br><br> <a href="http://vk.com/album-65336816_185938750"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/91b/aed/ef9/91baedef991621e2297566caf2744832.jpg"></a> <br><br>  The first CodeFest gathered 500 participants and turned out to be truly regional: 99% of the speakers and participants were from Novosibirsk.  At the same time, no bear and no dolls were noticed at the event. <br><br><h2>  CodeFest ‚Ññ 2 - warm tube </h2><br>  Inspired by the success, after all the praise and wishes to continue in the same spirit, without hesitation, they began to prepare the next CodeFest. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/jwr_eOk7pps" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  A retrospective of the results of the first experience showed that if we want to grow, then to put it mildly, we need to work on many things: speed up the process of issuing badges, ensure timely supply of coffee and buns with cranberries, find a new room and most importantly - we realized that the chip with local speakers the second time is not a ride. <br><br>  So we started to actually make another CodeFest, a little like the first.  It seemed to us that we took into account absolutely everything.  And even 150 participants (a total of 500 people planned), who registered on the very first day of opening the registration did not alert us.  As it turned out, nothing. <br><br>  By lunchtime, the first day of the conference, it became clear that there were actually almost twice as many people as we had planned: a two-day supply of coffee and bread rolls was already empty by 12:00 and unambiguously hinted at riots in the fight for the remnants of provisions. <br><br> <a href="https://vk.com/album-65336816_186080276"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/b7b/f27/b24/b7bf27b240cb48243eb87f0ef2ebce8d.jpg"></a> <br><br>  Of course, we prevented unrest, and as a result of the second CodeFest, we finally formed our own traditions: the event only on weekends, flat-house, buns with cranberries, whiskey end, informal afterparty at the end of the first day and the main thing is the amazing atmosphere that the participants themselves create ! <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/e84/4f3/59e/e844f359e947741cb451b560affaeb0e.jpg"><br><br>  In a separate line, I would like to thank Alexander Lyskovsky, who, with his modest offer to write a letter to his fellow CIOs, provided us with traffic comparable only to TV advertising on the first button in prime time. <br><br>  According to the participants themselves, <a href="http://2011.codefest.ru/program/%3Futm_source%3Dnews%26utm_medium%3Dhabr%26utm_campaign%3Dpost_tort">this CodeFest</a> turned out to be a warm tube and definitely played with new colors.  Almost 900 participants flew to the event, and we, as a sign of gratitude, bought ourselves a coffee machine in the office :) <br><br><h2>  CodeFest ‚Ññ 3 - sexy, cute, mimimi </h2><br>  And again, we were sure that we had caught luck by the tail and had foreseen everything: we had prepared an excellent program, bought traditional buns with cranberries, agreed with partners.  It remains, as they say, only to test and stop, when suddenly we find out that we simply have no place to hold CodeFest.  This happens when the site suddenly changes plans and decides to hold on these dates another event. <br><br>  But we didn‚Äôt have any luck, so we quickly found another platform, redrew the program, learned the basics of logistics and organized the delivery of several hundred people to the Expocenter, which is located at some distance both from the center and from the rest of Novosibirsk.  So we tested the just-handed complex for strength, for which we are each other infinitely grateful. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/UOIMB3sGAFA" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  Eyewitnesses claim that it was the <a href="http://2012.codefest.ru/program/%3Futm_source%3Dnews%26utm_medium%3Dhabr%26utm_campaign%3Dpost_tort">best CodeFest</a> in dynamics, saturation, atmosphere and in general. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/F6wPLQZdgvY" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  One of 1,300 participants <a href="http://novosibirsk.flamp.ru/firm/codefest_krupnejjshaya_it_konferenciya_za_uralom-141265770762921/otzyv-39664">expressed his emotions in the</a> following way: ‚ÄúGuys, today I walked along the red avenue and saw a boom in a T-shirt‚Äú I love RIF + CIB ‚Äù, well, I jumped and sharply jumped at him from the turntable and explained it with a cry‚Äú KODEFEST ‚Äù because I‚Äôm mad about web development, the boys of the old school spirit live only on Codefest, where they are chopped up on the sidelines by hardcore, where you can meet old and new friends and cool developers, testers, designers and other professionals, where two days are the coolest reports where there are quarrels, whiskey-party and the most  utaya organizing team!  ONLY KODEFEST ONLY HARDCOR !!! ‚Äù <br><br><h2>  CodeFest ‚Ññ 4 - the same Faberge, only from the side </h2><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/3fa/3cd/044/3fa3cd044f2063b7c04ea352ca9661a2.jpg"><br><br>  Many people criticize us for last year's <a href="http://2013.codefest.ru/program/%3Futm_source%3Dnews%26utm_medium%3Dhabr%26utm_campaign%3Dpost_tort">CodeFest</a> : someone didn‚Äôt like the program, someone thought that everything was too calm and measured, someone seemed to have insufficient meals, and someone oversaw the registration for the fourth time and didn‚Äôt get to the event. <br><br>  <i>Hostess on the note.</i>  <i>Historically, we open registration at CodeFest a month before the event, and close it in two weeks, as +1 000 tickets fly at lightning speed.</i> <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Uk-UPqQ0aO8" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  But the truth is that we did not try to outdo ourselves last year, we had a completely different task: <br>  1) to test the participation of foreign speakers; <br>  2) explore the potential capacity of the site. <br>  In general, no innovation, only research. <br><br><h2>  CodeFest number 5 - again cake </h2><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/24b/6f9/aa1/24b6f9aa115e9fa647d6b327b2244268.jpg"><br>  <sub>Oh, and we grab off from the <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/users/pilikoff/" class="user_link">pilikoff</a> at our <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/users/pilikoff/" class="user_link">shelter</a> for such liberties with the font and logo</sub> <br><br>  This year CodeFest is held for the fifth time, which means there will be a cake! <br><br>  <a href="http://2014.codefest.ru/program/%3Futm_source%3Dnews%26utm_medium%3Dhabr%26utm_campaign%3Dpost_tort">We rewrote the program a bit</a> : the Web and Enterprise sections were combined in the Backend (do not look at the dubious division on the site - we‚Äôll fix it from day to day) and add the Frontend section. <br><br>  The speakers promise to speak a lot in English, so urgently pull up the spoken language - headsets with the voice of an interpreter are not enough for everyone. <br><br>  Apartment owners - as without them!  The unique format of an arbitrary program, in which any CodeFest participant can gather an audience and discuss a particular topic.  Unfortunately (or fortunately), home team members are so popular that this time we had to collect all applications in advance and schedule them for both days. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/87c/7a1/059/87c7a1059860ca42ec1fa39426b927a8.jpg"><br><br>  According to information from our source in the program committee, the program for home stand is fire.  We will post it on the site next week so as not to distract from the main program. <br><br>  In the intervals between performances we will hold mass readings of congratulatory toasts, give presents and post to social networks. <br><br>  At the end of the first day, traditionally - afterparty.  This time we found a room that can accommodate up to 350 people at once, which means it will be more fun. <br><br>  Lunches will be traditional. <br><br>  CodeFest 2014 will be held March 29-30.  Traditionally in Novosibirsk.  Traditionally in the Expocentre. <br><br>  Registration for CodeFest will open on February 24th.  We hope that this time we will not have to close it in a week, and we will be able to welcome everyone. <br><br>  Read us in <a href="https://twitter.com/codefestru">tweeters</a> , look at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/codefestru">YouTube</a> , study on <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/codefest/">sladsheirah</a> .
