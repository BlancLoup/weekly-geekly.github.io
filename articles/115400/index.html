This decision was not taken from the ceiling, all this was necessary for the service that we did, did, and finally did - video chat.  Now the user can not only write a message, but also make a call, talk by voice or in video call mode.  Directly from the browser, it is enough to have a microphone or a webcam and click the ‚Äúcall‚Äù button in the friend‚Äôs profile.  The server was written by itself, in our case it is impossible to use slow-moving media combines, and have achieved a good payload.  But we are afraid of the habr effect, but there will be a good test drive of everything that we have programmed there.  :) <br>  We also screwed a graffiti-drawing on the wall in the profile.  Of the features, you can highlight the ability to enclose the background, either for a delineation or for the background.  As well as the ability to post one graffiti on several walls, and save it in the gallery.

      Each group in the "World" has now got its own chat.  Like the good old web1.0 times.  You can participate in thematic communication around the clock right on the main page of your favorite group, instantly receive and send messages. <br><br>  And also in order to rally the already cohesive groups of groups, we implemented a group work with photo albums.  Now the groups will contain both author albums and "group".  All that is needed for the album to become a group is to indicate when creating or in the settings who and how many photos can be loaded into it. <br><br>  We completely reworked the work with the media part of the network.  On media pages now only media, and nothing but media!  The entire width of the page is occupied by photos, video and audio, we moved all the navigation controls to the top and bottom of the page, as well as to the hot keys. <br>  For albums, as a preview, a photo or video from an album is no longer used, and the user can see the contents of the first page of the album without entering it - now this is a preview.  We call it Live-preview because it is real live. <br><br>  Managing the appearance and content of your media is now more convenient than ever.  It is as if you are laying out the photos on the table, just as you plan to show them to your friends and guests in your albums. <br><br>  The changes also affected the communication part of the resource.  The groups added the ability to disable unused sections, as well as expanded functionality for managing forums.  Now you can divide the forum in groups into categories, organizing thematic communication.  Communities will no longer experience discomfort from a large flow of messages in one forum. <br><br>  In addition to changes and improvements, we have worked on innovations.  One of which is a mood indicator.  Now each user can specify his current mood, accompany him with a comment and share with friends or with the whole world.  And everyone will be able to support the user or enjoy with him.  The total set of moods is displayed in the form of ‚Äúaverage temperature in the hospital‚Äù - the mood of the network.  Now, the ‚Äúcollective consciousness‚Äù of the network - ether, has been complemented by a collective mood. <br><br>  <a href="http://worldis.me/">http://worldis.me</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/115400/">https://habr.com/ru/post/115400/</a></p>
