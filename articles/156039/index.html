  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Battle City on unity in 1 day?</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/1d4/24a/f3a/1d424af3af24b078cb2d92e8ba9884ff.jpg"><br>  Is it possible to make a simple game in one day on the unity, without having experience in this? <br>  The question was rhetorical, until we tried. <br>  There is such a project - 2niversity.  This project appeared recently, but I really liked their goal - to collect young people and to organize a one-day intensive course for it absolutely free of charge in order to improve skills in any technology. <br><br>  When the manager of this project called me and offered to try to hold such an event on unity, I thought. <br>  On the one hand, personally everything seemed simple to me - 5-7 hours for a simple game and everything is ready, on the other hand, people who participate in the role of students will have to use this engine for the first time.  Maybe for the first time they will have to try themselves as game creators.  If you are interested in how this experiment ended, please under the cat <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Upon reflection, it was decided to choose the <a href="http://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_City">Battle City</a> project with NES in order to try their hand.  Why not?  The game is simple, quite famous.  There is no physics, the field is small, artificial intelligence is not particularly required - the very thing is to begin to master the technology. <br>  My colleague-artist prepared a simple art and, armed with enthusiasm, we started! <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/531/e3b/d67/531e3bd679bb98bf6c55821de186d41e.jpg">

      The students gathered and divided into 4 teams of 3-4 people.  We tried to separate those who already had some experience in the unity, equally.  The task was simple - to make a clone of tanks.  The game should have included such elements as gameplay, interface, Ai, and, of course, the beginning and end of the game.  And in fact, it was not a requirement to create tanks - the guys could decide in their group to create any game, tanks were just a suggestion.  By the way, one of the teams made 2D flying with a helicopter, which surprised the organizers a lot. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/1c5/6d2/3d3/1c56d23d38169cf806bcbf17d446c04e.jpg"><br><br>  The task was allocated about 5-7 hours with a lunch break. <br>  Yes, the teams had questions.  Yes, many passed the way from ‚Äúhow to make a tank move‚Äù to ‚Äúhow to spawn enemies‚Äù. <br>  But it's nice that all the teams reached the finish line.  Everything! <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/262/c4d/690/262c4d6905b0df4bedcbefc0d12b9b7f.jpg"><br><br>  Of course, on average, everything was simple: movement in physics, control from the keyboard, intelligence - a random choice of direction and shooting.  But not much time was allotted! <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/4a8/601/103/4a8601103dc9cc3a7fde0583764981f2.png"><br><br>  Someone screwed up nice special effects to the game, someone changed the gameplay to Sokoban (yes, there were such), but everyone made a small game that could be played!  One team even made a two-dimensional flight simulator from scratch, and even the models and animations for them were made by the guys at this event. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/08b/4e5/93f/08b4e593f3b81e15b18d7f8cd599b803.png"><br><br>  This was not a competition, because no prizes were supposed to, but I hope that this experience was useful for the participants. <br>  I realized one thing - yes, a game that can be sold may not be made for 1 day, but it is quite possible to make a prototype. <br><br>  <b>UPD: perezalil on github</b> <br>  Perhaps someone will be interested to look under the hood, <a href="https://github.com/vtornik23/small_unity3d_projects">here is the source code of the project</a> . <br><br>  <b>UPD:</b> another <a href="http://github.com/megaDRONe86/UTanks">githaba artwork</a> <br><br>  <b>UPD: the</b> guys who created the helicopter, sent a link to your <a href="http://github.com/mordet/Helicopter">project</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/156039/">https://habr.com/ru/post/156039/</a></p>
