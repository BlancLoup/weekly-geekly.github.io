  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Inner world OZON.ru</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  In November, a field lesson was organized for students of the specialization <a href="http://www.rma.ru/internet/about.html">‚ÄúManagement in the field of Internet technologies‚Äù</a> at the logistics center of the <a href="http://www.ozon.ru/">OZON.ru</a> online store, which is located in Tver.  PR director of the company, Mikhail Yatkovsky, spoke about the features of the organization and the specifics of this business. <br><br>  OZON.ru is the largest Russian online store offering books, film and music products, electronics, photo equipment and mobile phones, software and multimedia games and much more.  The online store was opened in 1998 and is one of the first large-scale domestic projects in e-commerce.  At its source was a group of enthusiasts who like fiction and fantasy from St. Petersburg, who created a special Internet resource for sharing impressions about favorite literary genres and new books.  Along with the discussion of books, participants in discussions were actively interested in where these books can be purchased.  So the idea was born of opening an online store that would use the created electronic bibliographic catalog, and in which one could purchase the books under discussion. <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  ‚ÄúWhen it comes to online stores, it implies the so-called distance sales, that is, such sales, when the buyer does not see the goods.  The first type of remote sales - postal catalogs, which are widely spread after the Second World War.  Gradually, the practice of telephone orders appeared, and only in the early 1990s did Internet trade begin to spread.  I must say, potential buyers still have a psychological distrust of distance selling, ‚Äùsays Mikhail Yatkovsky.

      Speaking about the methods of payment for goods purchased via the Internet, PR-director of OZON.ru spoke <b>about the problems existing in the Russian market.</b> <br><br>  ‚ÄúWorldwide, more than 90 percent of e-commerce is paid using bank cards or payment systems.  In Russia, one has to deal with a very high percentage of collection.  Representatives of the Amazon.com online store are in a panic from such a situation in the Russian market. ‚Äù <br><br>  Mikhail Yatkovsky emphasized that the <b>project OZON.ru was initially unprofitable.</b> <br><br>  ‚ÄúAt some point, a conflict arose between OZON.ru as a selling business and OZON.ru as a content project.  Initially, the project was unprofitable - money was brought only by the business, not the content.  Shareholders decided that the project should bring business, and in 2001 reforms began - the structure of OZON.ru was formed.  Then we ran into various problems due to the fact that there were more and more requests.  By the way, in 2003, our service ceased to function if visitors simultaneously made three requests.  As a result, a new company website was created. ‚Äù <br><br>  Recently, there has been an <b>increase in confidence in online shopping.</b>  ‚ÄúNow the credibility of online shopping is growing, people use this service more and more.  The bulk of orders diverges in Moscow - about 65 percent of all our clients are concentrated here, 14 percent of clients fall to St. Petersburg.  There are practically no orders from abroad, because in this case there are difficulties with delivery, ‚ÄùYatkovsky notes. <br><br>  PR-director of OZON.ru also told about how the <b>work of the logistics center of the company in Tver is organized.</b> <br><br>  ‚ÄúMore than 400 people work in the warehouse in Tver.  The work is carried out in two shifts, and from next year we plan to organize work in three shifts, that is, to add to the two existing night shifts. <br><br>  If we talk about the value of our employees, the IT service stands out here, this is our golden fund.  The loss of even one employee from this department is very significant, so the company‚Äôs management is doing everything possible so that these people do not leave. ‚Äù <br><br>  During the lesson, Mikhail Yatkovsky spoke about the structure of the leading Russian online store. <br><br>  ‚ÄúLike any enterprise, OZON.ru consists of several departments. <br><br>  <b>‚Ä¢ Logistics Department</b> - is engaged in the control of traffic flows, both incoming and outgoing, working with delivery services. <br><br>  <b>‚Ä¢ Product description department</b> - employees of this department make a description of the products presented in the store, accompany them with photos, and also edit the relevant pages of the site. <br><br>  <b>‚Ä¢ Department for the collection of orders</b> - carries a set of goods on the established order form, which indicates the names of products required by the client. <br><br>  <b>‚Ä¢ Control Department</b> - monitors the work of the order collection department, checks the conformity of the actual goods to the one ordered by the store customer. <br><br>  <b>‚Ä¢ Packaging Department</b> - is engaged in packaging products. <br><br>  <b>‚Ä¢ Technical Support Department</b> - is responsible for working with "iron". <br><br>  <b>‚Ä¢ Design Department</b> - ensures that external graphic unity is present on the site. <br><br>  <b>‚Ä¢ Marketing department</b> - deals with contextual and online advertising, conducts combined advertising campaigns, including offline.  It should be noted that the cost of attracting a client in the online area is about 9-12 dollars. <br><br>  <b>‚Ä¢ Department of analytics</b> - is responsible for analyzing the behavior of visitors, monitors records, compiles a database of clients.  It should be noted that we have a Top-4 service - based on the analysis of its behavior, any four products are recommended to the user. <br><br>  <b>‚Ä¢ Assortment Department</b> - is responsible for the range of products provided, as well as for the pricing policy of the company.  By the way, now on our site about 380 thousand names of various kinds of products are presented. <br><br>  <b>‚Ä¢ Purchasing department</b> - is engaged in the purchase of goods, which is ordered by the assortment department. <br><br>  I think it makes no sense to talk about what the legal department and accounting do, because everything is clear here, ‚ÄùYatkovsky said. <br><br>  During the course, the PR director of the OZON.ru online store answered the questions of interest to the audience. <br><br>  <b>- Is the opinion that the goods on the Internet should be cheaper?</b> <br>  - If you work in strict accordance with the law, the prices on the Internet and on the offline market will be about the same.  Goods on the Internet can not be 30 percent cheaper than in a regular store, because we have costs that they do not have. <br><br>  <b>- How many copies of books do you buy?</b> <br>  - As a rule, from three to five copies, but there are exceptions.  For example, the last book about Harry Potter we bought in the amount of 5 thousand copies, and it sold out instantly.  Periodically, the system is counting how many books you need to buy.  We buy books again, gradually the demand for them falls, the system feels it and reduces its performance. <br><br>  <b>- Are opening online stores with offline retailers sensitive for you?</b> <br>  - So that we feel it on ourselves, a lot of time must pass.  You need to understand that this is a completely different type of business.  Offline-retailers simply do not have enough experience in the field of online-trading. <br><br>  <b><a href="http://www.rma.ru/gals133.html%3B16">PHOTOS</a></b> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/46059/">https://habr.com/ru/post/46059/</a></p>
