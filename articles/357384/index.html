  <section class="page js-page"><h1>How does a pension fund merge personal data</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  For a start, I would like to make a small lyrical digression.  Long ago (although you can sometimes still be met), young girls and boys as PC operators, various salespeople, etc., made emails to their customers in a fairly simple way - one letter and all customers in the recipients.  Someone complained that his address shines in this way, someone rejoiced at the living base of competitors.  Nevertheless, the data distribution can be found much less. <br><br>  Recently, a mass mailing from the local branch of the pension fund arrived on the electronic document flow.  Bulk - this means that all policyholders received the same messages registered in this fund.  In the attachment was a Word file describing the essence of the letter. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/d12/0cd/298/d120cd298c3446eeb707be884b714ddb.png">

      The most quick-witted, I think already guessed what was in the second file. <br><br>  <b>Important UPD 3 under the cut</b> <br><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/c9d/30d/cc2/c9d30dcc20e04f56adc9d4e19fab0802.jpg"></a> <br>  <i>(the image is clickable, the lines in the middle are hidden for clarity of the entire volume)</i> <br><br>  Yes Yes.  In the second file is a list with personal data, including SNILS, the address of registration and place of work, the date of birth <b>of 17,752 people</b> ! <br><br>  I can not say that it is laziness or stupidity.  But the fact remains. <br><br>  <b>UPD A little research obtained file</b> <br><br>  The letter was received 09.06.  The file with the tablet was created much earlier, and I suspect that it was originally insured in all the departments of the pension fund.  Apparently, on June 9, extra lines with insurers from other PF branches were removed from the file.  Therefore, I quite naturally suspect that the data of the insured, at least in Moscow and the Moscow region, were thus distributed to entrepreneurs <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/7d1/2e4/aef/7d12e4aef0704aad8b5f8ac1129b75d4.jpg"><br><br>  <b>UPD 2</b> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/c86/33f/807/c8633f8074284c44b55ddf058da8bbe1.jpg"><br><br>  <b>UPD 3</b> <br><br>  I just have to make this addition, in view of the absolutely crazy <a href="https://polit.info/350015-pensionnyi-fond-vyyasnyaet-kak-dannye-17-tysyach-chelovek-popali-v-rassylku">comment of the official representative of the FIU</a> <br><br>  <i>Leak could occur at the provider.</i> <i><br><br></i>  <i>The Moscow Pension Fund denies its guilt in the leakage of personal data of 17 thousand people.</i>  <i>How did web developer Sergey Deryabin receive to his mail a file with an Excel table with SNILS numbers, registration addresses, places of work, and also birth dates of 17,752 people, now find out.</i>  <i>Head of the Media Relations Department of the Pension Fund of the Russian Federation in the city of Moscow and the Moscow Region Marina Gustova told this to the Politika Segodnya Information Agency.</i> <br><br>  Let me remind you that the newsletter did not come to the post office, but via the electronic document flow: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/b2a/5d1/fd1/b2a5d1fd1db646e2a50ea918745f0df2.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Accordingly, there is a sender's electronic signature, the integrity of the shipment, and other amenities available with electronic document management.  And the data provider is not interested in being extreme, so if you have questions in turn, you would quickly dispel this myth as well. <br><br>  Just in case, once again, they did not send me an email (email, email), they sent me as they like to talk via a secure data channel.  Everything is good here, but neither I nor the other 90% of employers were supposed to get it.  And the one who should have received, they should receive a list only with their employees. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/357384/">https://habr.com/ru/post/357384/</a></p>
