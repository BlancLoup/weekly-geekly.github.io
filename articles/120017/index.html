  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Traction with paypal (or problems after changing the name)</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Below, I will try to fully describe to you how paypal blocked, and then just deleted my account, after I changed my last name a little. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  It so happened that I changed my surname when I changed my passport (I‚Äôm going to make a reservation right away, I‚Äôm Belarus and we have the names in English in the passport ‚Äúcrookedly.‚Äù Note Petrov, it will be written as Piatroy, from the transcription from the Belarusian translation of Pyatro. ‚Äù Petrov-&gt; Pyatro—û-&gt; Piatroy).  As in the example, I showed a scheme with the name Petrov, we‚Äôll make a start from it, I decided to change the name in the passport to Petrov. <br>  As it turned out, changing the name in this way is very simple, you need to write a regular application to the head of the passport office.  What was done.  After 2 weeks, I received my new passport with a new name and began to change documents slowly.  Right, documents on the car (it took half a day).  Arriving in Moscow (I work here), I also changed my salary card. <br>  And at some point before the New Year, I decided to use paypal to pay for ebay gift (yes yes yes, I had a name with a name for a long time).  I thought that the binding of the new card would be painless, for this reason I didn‚Äôt steam too much.  But going to paypal and seeing that in the account when adding a card it is impossible to change the name was very upset.  Posted in support and began to wait.  A day later, a letter arrived, where they asked me from a support to send a court decision giving me the right to change my name.  Having painted everything to them about how the names are ‚Äúformed‚Äù in Belarus and how they can be easily changed, with the hope of justice and humanity, again sent them a letter.  The next day I again received a letter in which I was asked to show a court decision or marriage documents (O_O).  MORE, I sent them scans of a new and old passport, as well as scans of driver's licenses.  Nothing this helped. <br>  I fought with a stick like that for a week, until such time as they stopped my account, the reason for this, as they said, is ‚ÄúYour account is too suspicious‚Äù (for all 3 years of using a stick, I think I have a clean story myself, not a single clam on me).  In the support they asked me to send an apartment bill (the so-called bill), I explained to them the situation that I am a foreign citizen working in Moscow and I don‚Äôt have my home here, so this bill will be in another name.  Having enclosed a bill from the Republic of Belarus with my name and a bill from the Russian Federation with the address indicated in the stick, I sent it to them.  As a result, the next day I received a letter saying that my account will be deleted after 6 months, due to the fact that it is suspicious.  I was given six months for the withdrawal of all funds. <br><br>  All hopes that everything is beautiful and good in the West and I have no insanity.  Although I agree that the situation is not standard, but still very upset by the decision of the stick to delete my account. <br><br>  UP: Mail links: <br>  <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/i_am_angry/120017/">habrahabr.ru/blogs/i_am_angry/120017/#comment_3929731</a> <br>  <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/i_am_angry/120017/">habrahabr.ru/blogs/i_am_angry/120017/#comment_3929732</a> <br>  <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/i_am_angry/120017/">habrahabr.ru/blogs/i_am_angry/120017/#comment_3929734</a> <br>  <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/i_am_angry/120017/">habrahabr.ru/blogs/i_am_angry/120017/#comment_3929735</a> <br>  <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/i_am_angry/120017/">habrahabr.ru/blogs/i_am_angry/120017/#comment_3929754</a> <br>  <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/i_am_angry/120017/">habrahabr.ru/blogs/i_am_angry/120017/#comment_3929757</a>

      Actually, I thought (and still think) what the reason was: <br><br>  A current utility bill.  The bill must show your name and address exactly <br>  as they appear in your paypal account or else you can add a <br>  address in your account. <br><br>  In general, the stick behaves strangely (although it is logical), I recently tried to change the delivery address from the Russian Federation to the Republic of Belarus in a stick, then the stick did not give, there the country is hard-coded.  As it turned out - this is a fight against fraudsters. <br>  Thus, it turns out, having moved to another country, you will have to change the stick account (does anyone have the opposite examples?). </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/120017/">https://habr.com/ru/post/120017/</a></p>
