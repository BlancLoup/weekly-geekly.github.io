  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Articles about a portable Linux server for newbies - are they needed?</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  In this series of articles, I‚Äôll tell you how to make your portable Linux server from an EEE Pc 701 netbook capable of many tasks, like this: <br><br><ul><li>  <b>Distribution of 3G Internet from a USB modem</b> (yes, in principle, even from a toaster) <b>via a Wi-Fi card</b> , plus the use of external proxies and VPN is transparent to the user </li><li>  <b>Secure file server</b> - virus protection and the like </li><li>  <b>Checking Wi-Fi networks</b> , and almost anything, password protected, <b>for durability</b> </li><li>  <b>Voice alert system</b> </li><li>  <b>Voice recognition system and voice</b> control respectively </li><li>  <b>Portable media player</b> and alarm clock </li><li>  <b>Fixed telephone</b> (I would like to use an internal modem) </li><li>  <b>Server surveillance and streaming sound from a microphone</b> - can sometimes be extremely useful if you need to eavesdrop on someone </li><li>  <b>Device for repairing routers with flashing firmware</b> , using TFTP and USB-UART converter, and a couple of scripts to facilitate their efforts </li><li>  A lot of interesting things that just come to mind. </li></ul><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Articles will be designed for those who are not afraid of computers and are willing to experiment.  For experiments, I will choose the Asus EEE Pc 701 4G netbook with the Debian system - I got it with a broken screen at a symbolic price of $ 25, so I immediately set about trying to make a portable server out of it that could survive in rather harsh conditions.  In principle, a laptop has nothing to lose in the fall, except for the hard drive and the screen, but the screen is broken, and the hard drive in this laptop is missing in principle - instead of it, there is a 4 GB flash drive inside, which will serve as the system drive.  Batteries for this laptop are inexpensive, about $ 20 on dx.com, and I‚Äôm happy to buy a couple more, since they are small in size - all for portability.  I also plan to do a little modding of this laptop - to solder internal USB ports, and connect something functional to them, like a Bluetooth adapter.  Why do I need this? <br><br><ul><li>  Portability.  So many of the most necessary functions in my life in my bag are very convenient to have. </li><li>  Getting experience with the Debian system.  I will not say, of course, that I don‚Äôt have it at all, but I still want more. </li><li>  A lot of fun when setting up and using - will be required. </li><li>  It will turn out just a cool gadget that will make life easier. </li></ul><br><h4>  What is? </h4><br><h6>  System Information: </h6><br>  Debian 7 <br><pre><code class="bash hljs">uname -a:</code> </pre> <br>  &gt; Linux localhost 3.2.0-4-486 # 1 Debian 3.2.41-2 i686 GNU / Linux <br>  No desktop shell is installed, because it simply makes no sense - the screen is completely broken, and you can safely do everything you need via SSH.  I will use the account root - it just does not make sense to create another one, since it is planned to set up the system once and not to use it again - is it then worth making an account for the user?  My favorite programming language is Python, but for the program part I will use Bash - most of the Bash scripts are more convenient for Linux automation tasks. <br>  A battery of indefinite capacity - it‚Äôs possible that I‚Äôm already significantly hooked, I can‚Äôt test it with Windows XP and Everest in order to get detailed information about the expected working time and so on.  However, when the power saving is on and configured, it works for a relatively long time - about 2 hours.

I really had to find the right one and put it inside, but with a screwdriver, this is not a problem. </li><li>  Built-in speakers and microphone, Ethernet 100/10 Mbps, VGA-out, 3xUSB (+ 2 unsoldered inside), SATA - unsoldered inside </li><li>  3G modem from one Latvian provider </li><li>  Patience </li></ul><br><h4>  What is planned? </h4><br><h5>  Make some iron netbook mods: </h5><br><ul><li>  Internal infrared port for remote control - it makes no sense to use SSH or keyboard blindly each time, but a small remote control would be perfect </li><li>  E-SATA port using non-soldered SATA pins on the motherboard </li><li>  Perhaps the banal expansion of the hard drive (flash drive for user data inside) and built-in Bluetooth. </li></ul><br><h5>  Make an almost full-fledged portable server out of a laptop: </h5><br><ul><li>  Creating a WiFi access point </li><li>  Setting up a DHCP server </li><li>  Routing between two interfaces - external and local </li><li>  3G modem connection </li><li>  Network boot for other machines </li><li>  CCTV </li><li>  File server </li><li>  Voice alert </li></ul><br><h5>  Other purposes: </h5><br><ul><li>  Hydra for password selection and other things. </li><li>  A bunch of Aircrack, Reaver and other cool stuff - of course, pentesting and pentesting only </li><li>  CMU Sphinx based voice recognition system </li><li>  Playing music (well, why not?) </li><li>  To be continued </li></ul><br><h5>  Required dopily: </h5><br><ul><li>  Energy saving setting </li><li>  Cleaning up the space on the hard disk (removing unnecessary packages and backup files, well, there on the little things) </li><li>  To be continued </li></ul><br><h5>  So the question is. </h5>  Would the residents of Habrahabr like to read a series of articles on similar topics?  I work on articles in my spare time and I hope that they will help Linux newbies to master the application of various packages in the conditions of such servers, possibly built-in or portable, like mine, and comprehend some of the most interesting parts of the designer, which are based on Linux  Of course, these articles can be useful for the same portable computers based on the Raspberry Pi or other popular platforms - and indeed for everything that Linux can be installed on and connected to the network - the same <a href="http://www.embeddedarm.com/software/arm-netbsd-toaster.php">toasters are</a> no exception.  After these articles, I will probably start a book that will help a user who has never run into a Linux system, but has worked with Windows, to master Linux at least to the beginner level, but apparently this will be a topic for a separate blog - on Habr√© is still mostly people more or less familiar with this system or have an idea about it.  Will be claimed or not?  That is the question. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/188108/">https://habr.com/ru/post/188108/</a></p>
