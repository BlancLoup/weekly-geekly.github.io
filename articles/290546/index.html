We have the application ‚ÄúChildren's interactive developing magazine‚Äù, within the framework of which we are releasing inside educational content in the form of separate issues of the magazine on various topics.  We decided to hold a campaign for regular and new users.  Namely, once a week throughout the summer, make one of our magazines free to purchase. <br><br>  But there were some difficulties with what day is best to choose to distribute free numbers of magazines. <br>  Our reasoning and the variant of the day of the week on which we stayed is under the cut. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h2>  To decide on whom the bun is focused </h2><br>  Since our application is aimed at children aged 2 to 7 years, our main users are children.  On the other hand, the filter of content consumption in the application and the decision about what children will play in, as well as the decision to purchase new issues of magazines is made by the parent.  Accordingly, handing out buns in our application, we focus <b><i>on the parent.</i></b>

    <h2>  Determine the day of maximum user activity in the application </h2><br>  After analyzing the statistics of the application, we see that the maximum activity of using our application falls on Saturday and Sunday.  Like the maximum revenue from the sale of content also falls on these days.  Accordingly, once the application is used so actively these days, it is not worthwhile to additionally distribute free content these days.  After playing enough with the already acquired issues of magazines, the child may ask the parent to buy more.  What a parent on a day off with pleasure will go. <br><br><h2>  What platform can you experiment on? </h2><br>  Of course, on iOS.  No other story allows you to plan content price changes as flexibly as Apple does.  You can easily set the date and price of content and applications for a specific day.  And you do not need to re-send IAP purchase for review. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/3cd/4c6/770/3cd4c67704014ff29776c203bb7460a1.png"><br><br>  Android does not allow IAP to make free and set it a price of 0. <br>  Windows Phone Store and Windows Store allow you to make IAP free, but you cannot set a date for price changes in advance and each purchase or application must be re-moderated.  Although this happens quickly, you still need to prepare everything in advance on the day of the sale.  Therefore, we stopped at iOS. <br><br><h2>  So which day to choose? </h2><br>  If you distribute content at the beginning of the week, then there is a possibility that the parent is busy with working fuss at the beginning of the week and may not pay attention to the content or forget about the new content by the weekend.  It does not make much sense to do this on weekends either, on the one hand, users together with their children are already actively spending time in the app.  On the other hand, on weekends, children with parents may find themselves in a place where online content cannot be uploaded quickly due to the banal lack of Internet. <br><br>  As a result, we stayed on Friday.  After all, on Friday everyone is preparing for the weekend.  We decided to additionally inform the users about what kind of journal this Friday is for free sending out PUSH messages.  With a very high probability, the user will have an Internet connection and he will be able to receive the corresponding message, slowly download and install content and do not forget to show his child on the weekend. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/106/e0f/f41/106e0ff415574f7ba76f91e1dcb7b2c3.png"><br><br><h2>  What we expect from this experiment </h2><br>  We expect to increase the base of regular users of our application, increase the return of users to the application in anticipation of new content, as well as increasing the assessment and the number of installations of the application due to the word of mouth among users. <br><br>  The experiment will start tomorrow for users of mobile applications under iOs.  Every week we will distribute one paid magazine and one paid fairy tale - FREE. <br><br>  Applications that participate in the experiment: <br><ul><li>  <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/ru/app/apple-store/id838822499%3Fpt%3D63913800%26ct%3Dmegamozg%26mt%3D8">Educational games for kids - children's magazine</a> </li><li>  <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/ru/app/apple-store/id838814553%3Fpt%3D63913800%26ct%3Dmegamozg%26mt%3D8">Fairy tales for children with pictures</a> </li></ul><br>  We promise to share the results of the experiment in mid-summer, when certain statistics accumulate. <br>  --- <br>  Sincerely, Oleg Demyanov and the <a href="http://whisperarts.com/">Whisper Arts</a> team <br><br>  PS: And what day do you think is the most optimal for distribution of buns to mobile apps users?
