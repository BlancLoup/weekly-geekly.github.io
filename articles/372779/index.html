And it happened.  Falls from a great height?  No problem.  ThinkPad notebooks have been cheating death every day ‚Äî and have been doing it for more than twenty years. <br><br> <a href="https://geektimes.ru/company/lenovo/blog/281628/"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/bc0/c29/cb7/bc0c29cb7397eb5da64eabca756f28b4.jpg"></a> <br><br>  We learn from your stories amazing cases of laptop survival.  In addition, Lenovo is testing computers in case of incidents that are hard to imagine.  You dropped the ThinkPad from the bed and stairs.  They moved his car.  They poured cola, beer and a million cups of coffee on a laptop.  Also, at least one episode is known, when a person vomited directly on his computer.  In short, people don‚Äôt stand on ceremony with ThinkPad, but these examples are no match for what you read below. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/821/8aa/207/8218aa207b074ec87836453644c5f1ab.jpg">

Thanks to the quick response of rescuers, no one was hurt, which cannot be said about things.  The young man lost almost everything.  Everything except his ThinkPad.  At first, the laptop was badly burned, and during fire fighting it was flooded with water.  However, the computer was able to turn on and even saved all the information. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/c76/5b0/d98/c765b0d980c1aa53e932f67cffdfe316.jpg"><br><br><h2>  <font color="#d8291e">Fall from a construction cradle (May 2011)</font> </h2><br>  ‚ÄúAny laptop will survive a fall from six feet [1.8 meters] - but what about falling from the ceiling?‚Äù Lenovo engineers wondered at the 2011 ThinkPad X1 presentation.  Representatives of the company climbed on the mounting cradle about six meters and threw the laptop.  He fell on the carpet, and not the hard floor, but this is unlikely to soften the blow.  In addition, the fall looked hard, but the computer continued to work. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/JMkSxdR-W0g" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br><h2>  <font color="#d8291e">Rainy Season (November 2012)</font> </h2><br>  This story we learned from the user Uknowsi on <a href="http://imgur.com/a/EE3pH">Imgur</a> .  It is not known in which country everything happened, but the speech is clearly about the tropical region.  ‚ÄúI went on vacation for a month during the rainy season, and my house was flooded.  The laptop was flooded with water, the case began to become covered with mold.  It seemed to me that the computer was no good for anything, but after a week of drying I turned it on, and the ThinkPad started working.  Of the damage - only peeling paint.  The computer is still working, more than a year has passed. ‚Äù  Uknowsi, if you read this text, contact us: we will send a new ThinkPad without mold. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/f09/afd/25e/f09afd25ee0054c47a7a1981e46553e8.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/372/77c/751/37277c75192e109afa975437b70841ef.jpg"><br><br><h2>  <font color="#d8291e">Air conditioning blast in Bulgaria (September 2013)</font> </h2><br>  The story came from a Lenovo buyer from Sofia, the capital of Bulgaria.  A low-quality air conditioner exploded in the office, the flames and the heat wave swept through the whole room.  An eyewitness commented: ‚ÄúThe fire got to the laptop.  Despite the damage, he survived. ‚Äù  Pay attention to the keyboard, which is completely melted.  At the same time, the screen shows that Windows continues to work, as if nothing had happened. <br><br>  We learned that the owner of the ThinkPad allowed the Bulgarian business partner Lenovo to put a laptop in its center as evidence of the excellent work of engineers and the use of high-strength materials. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/a71/efd/466/a71efd4669f1ee08e331e7daa91ec2d7.jpg"><br><br><h2>  <font color="#d8291e">All liquids are nothing (March 2014)</font> </h2><br>  There is a school of cooks across the road from Lenovo's American headquarters, so when you needed to confirm the fluid-resistant ThinkPad, you didn't have to go far.  The team modeled situations that happen every now and then with laptops: they often get wet.  In the test for the included ThinkPad, they alternately poured a large glass of wine, a mug of coffee, and a glass of water with ice.  Such water procedures had no effect on the performance of the laptop. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/0U5n2WaMMHo" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/7f2/077/642/7f20776421451e178ed23e64ee6f9e5b.jpg"><br><br><h2>  <font color="#d8291e">Typhoon (January 2013)</font> </h2><br>  We liked this story from Facebook from the guy with the nickname Rough, who lives in the Philippines: ‚ÄúThree days after the typhoon, my wife and I were walking the dog in the park.  I saw a [ThinkPad] laptop, it was completely covered in wet mud.  I decided to take it with me - what if a whole detail would have happened.  Left the laptop to dry for two days, then turned it on - and he earned.  I didn‚Äôt even clean it off the dirt.  Bravo, Lenovo! "  (Rough did not publish photos, but from this story it is clear why we are doing a ThinkPad test for dirt and dust). <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/365/8e3/640/3658e36407fd9564f10f62b884c07c2c.jpg"><br><br>  If you know similar stories, send them to us - we will publish them in the following materials. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/b31/cc6/73e/b31cc673e47899cee920b1f3f3ce227e.jpg"></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/372779/">https://habr.com/ru/post/372779/</a></p>
