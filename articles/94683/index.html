  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Battle with Skylinsky Serpent. Empire Strikes Back</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  So, as some blog subscribers may remember, somewhere in August of last year I wrote a whole series of topics ( <a href="http://ksenobayt.habrahabr.ru/blog/67537/">one</a> , <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/prava/67635/">two</a> , <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/prava/67744/">three</a> , <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/prava/68007/">four</a> ) about how poorly the Tver branch of Astarta (working under the brand name, mother dear, "Skylink") considers the money of its customers. <br><br>  For those who are too lazy to poke links a little higher - I remind you.  It was a story about how I cheated about 1.6k banknotes, charging paid traffic to billing (I have a conditional unlimited tariff with a 50 MB / hour cap), how painfully I filed a claim and application for recalculation, about how they refused to accept them, yet they accepted them, and how, finally, recalculation with a creak was made. <br><br>  I remember one of the commentators in the second chronological topic said - "if only the next topic is not called" The Empire Strikes Back "."  You could say his words were prophetic. <a name="habracut"></a>

      So, this morning I, carelessly smacking, plopped down on my favorite chair, and tried to shove in the net. <br><br>  There was no network. <br><br>  Knowing how Sky works, and also knowing that he loves to cheat with limits, I decided to do the simplest test - is there a network, or were they just cut me off due to the lack of bank notes on the account.  To do this, it is enough to ping any external host ‚Äî if IP addresses are resolved, then this is a banal plug-in with the network.  If all traffic rests on the internal gateway - this is money. <br><br>  I think it is not necessary to say that traffic has rested against the gateway. <br><br>  I scratched my head and, after poking around for a couple of minutes Opera Mini, I got into my Skype Skype account. <br>  I looked, looked, and saw something like this: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/habraeffect/68/12/681210007f1bc8771d2fd952d6cd469b.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Naturally, I immediately got into the local billing for traffic detailing (yes, it was repaired on regional Skype points!) He was also not particularly good-natured - according to him, I sat for about a gigabyte with a penny tonight: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/habraeffect/93/7f/937f808322980cff9e260b9274392f90.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  The screenshot does not show the last session, at eight in the morning - it is about the same in volume. <br><br>  Do I have to say that at about 0-10, as you can see from the last free session, I went to bed? <br>  Let's look at the kind honest eyes of the wonderful StatistXP: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/habraeffect/3e/90/3e90820d437eeec878e7e59053f01ec5.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  And also in the eyes of Everest (look at the system log-s): <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/habraeffect/28/33/2833124c633217696b7fda3f25c33a81.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Naturally, I immediately called the Serpent support.  Support scratched the brain, and said exactly the same as he said in the summer - "these sessions are taken into account, you have to pay, contact at least in the sport lot." <br><br>  In general, a picture emerges - while I was asleep and had dreams about how <s>spaceships plow the Bolshoi Theater,</s> I finally pass the session, Skypoint decided that the 1,800 rubles subscription fee for this poor limit of 50 MB \ hour would not be enough, and decided it's not boring for me.  Or maybe my dreams were so heavy?  wow <br><br>  In general, now I am writing this topic, swearing and cursing at the Beeline zhoporez, cursing the Empire for the most I do not want - and in the plans, as then, unless writing a claim, a statement for recalculation, and a modest plea that it will all be resolved before the first numbers <br><br>  <b>UPD:</b> was in the office.  A girl of twenty-six years long screamed at me, and as long as I did not give a hint about the GKRF, I refused to accept the application.  In the end, when she left, the calm and benevolent girl calmly accepted the statement from me at the reception desk, flopped a stamp, and even skipped the part of the article with StatistXP logs.  Thank you, the girl behind the desk. <br><br>  To the girl with the badge ‚Äúmanager‚Äù, I wish in the next life to become a turnstile turntable. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/94683/">https://habr.com/ru/post/94683/</a></p>
