At this time, the well-known company <b>Bang &amp; Olufsen</b> decided to make a contribution to a good cause, which worked hard on the laptop's sound system.  Together with the division of <b>ASUS Golden Ear</b> , <b>Sonic Master</b> technology was born, which has already been discussed more than once.  But in short - all this is a software and hardware complex (speakers and resonators of increased size, special design, powerful amplifier and advanced codec), which as a result demonstrates a truly chic sound for laptops, comparable to good desktop speakers. <br><br>  All laptops of the N / NX series have sufficiently productive stuffing on board, so from one side they can be considered as DTR systems (Desktop Replacement).  Therefore, I will tell and show what is there and how)

    <h2>  Appearance </h2><br>  It all starts with a fully metal cover with fine polishing - these were found in some models of this series and the U / UX / UL series.  Until now, it looks very cool - a neat silver metal with black plastic looks just amazing.  The dimensions of the device are the most common (39x26.6x2.9-3.9cm, with a weight of 2.71kg with a battery), but in general it seems to be very compact. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/3ca/18b/efc/3ca18befce4781d65146772f854f1374.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  In many other aspects, the appearance is fairly typical.  I will not list the connectors - everything is in the photo.  However, not to mention the USB connector (3.0) and another USB port, combined with eSATA - convenient.  And, of course, the hardware switch Wi-Fi. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/d54/c45/bcf/d54c45bcf1b3b82ba97b405fa43f767e.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/cd1/445/98e/cd144598ef2d79717347bec3bfc5882e.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/402/0fa/33f/4020fa33f6efcd9813755eab9c75e6f6.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/04f/8f0/84f/04f8f084fb68033eb2a359440e160c74.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/ab6/7e6/370/ab67e6370b8a2115a5b23f6611078c0b.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  There is nothing interesting on the back: a few rubber feet and one small cap for accessing the RAM <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/57e/602/e6f/57e602e6fba36863420a7e87739ea6a5.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  The screen size is a considerable 15.6 inches (it has an LED backlight) and the resolution may differ (check with the store when buying!) - either 1366x768 or adults 1920x1080.  The screen is good in terms of colors and not bad in terms of viewing angles, but here is a glossy finish ... more precisely, dust and prints on it, which will certainly appear ... well, you understand. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/24d/3e9/360/24d3e936044b3842c71266ae14204fc8.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  To display the image on the big screen, there is both VGA (D-SUB) and HDMI, and the ‚Äúancient‚Äù port is brought to the back side, which is why it does not distract in everyday life.  The choice is either a DVD burner or a combined Blu-ray. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/36d/d4e/72f/36dd4e72fac9d9c387e36695267c35bd.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  This time I was surprised by the 2-megapixel camera - it had such a pleasant trifle as a curtain (with a diaphragm pseudo-pattern).  Those.  If desired, the image from the camera can be ‚Äúhidden‚Äù (just hide it, because closing the shutter does not turn off the camera).  A nice little thing, not overloading the appearance of the device as a whole. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/de8/9a8/2e1/de89a82e15a406821ee2c9d409b7e64c.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  The keyboard is very comfortable - split keys ("island type") with a pleasant to the touch texture.  A convenient layout (large Enter, Backspace and two Shift-a) with a digital block - despite the fact that the test version did not have Cyrillic buttons, typing was very convenient. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/129/607/e77/129607e779913ceffbf3b69461d36835.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  The presses are very quiet - if you wish, you can easily ‚Äúaccelerate‚Äù on such a keyboard.  It is a pity that there is no backlight - in such an expensive model, it would be very useful ... however, this misunderstanding somewhat compensates for damn pleasant material on the sides of the keyboard. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/06d/01a/b7d/06d01ab7d58d78d0066a956a41318126.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Slightly higher are the multimedia buttons and a few fancy indicators - they are part of the decor surrounding the buttons ... but at the same time they don't look disgusting - unobtrusive ones are so dim. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/a29/904/17d/a2990417dab30c65c9d2628cd19a8a45.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  And even higher is the metal grid, behind which are stereo speakers - I wrote about their sound just below.  And from the obvious - the grid will eventually clog with dust, which is at least not very beautiful aesthetically. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/dbf/ad7/a5b/dbfad7a5ba8f166e5f0bb6475fe25136.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  For lovers of finger swallowing, ASUS engineers have embedded a multi-touch touchpad from Elantech in the N53Jn.  The surface itself is not new - this has already occurred in a number of models and has worked well.  The button under the panel is rather resonant, but the click itself is very pleasant tactile.  If it were not for the brand chrome button, it would be very cool. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/553/9fa/a7b/5539faa7b7b1763674bee9f9eab608d9.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  All the space around the touchpad is made of brushed aluminum - it looks very neat and to some extent even expensive.  Below are several status LEDs. <br><br><h2>  Turn on and work </h2><br>  Like any other laptop from ASUS, this can be enabled in two ways - into the Windows operating system or into the ASUS ExpressGate system ( <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/asus/blog/88512/">review</a> ).  The latter is a heavily truncated Linux distribution, written in a hidden partition on the disk.  The main advantage of such a system is a fast download speed (only 7 seconds), but at the same time it is quite working.  This time, a modern version of ExpressGate was installed, in which they updated the interface, added settings and all sorts of applications.  But still there are the most necessary - Firefox, Skype, IM client (ICQ, Gmail and other protocols), multimedia players and file manager.  Nice bonus. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/408/892/1b3/4088921b321b6e96180f28dcf2fa3ec6.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/4ae/90a/a36/4ae90aa367f6bd545744fdbc4b2d16d6.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  The pre-installed Windows 7 Ultimate (64bit) is fully loaded in 25-30 seconds. <br><br>  Inside is a modern dual- <a href="http://syndication.intel.com/DistributeModule.aspx%3Fid%3D9454">core <b>Intel¬Æ Core ‚Ñ¢ i5-540M</b></a> processor with a clock frequency of 2.53GHz. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/56e/a05/5df/56ea055df1d6e4bf59f91b3e62a237ff.png" alt="image"><br><br>  In the automatic mode of the <b>Intel¬Æ Turbo Boost</b> Technology, the processor can accelerate to 3.066GHz. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/7d1/ff5/6f5/7d1ff56f5702f4f0d80cec342c4c54cd.png" alt="image"><br><br>  The maximum amount of memory (DDR3) with which the processor can operate is 8GB - in this case, exactly half as large, 4GB, is installed.  But you can buy and "top" version, stuffed with RAM. <br><br>  The laptop installs two video cards.  <b>Intel¬Æ HD Graphics is</b> integrated into the processor, which is enough to turn any high-resolution video;  and <b>nVidia GeForce GT 335M</b> is a discrete graphics card with 1GB of GDDR3 memory, the possibilities of which are quite <a href="http://www.notebookcheck.net/NVIDIA-GeForce-GT-335M.24060.0.html">enough</a> for most modern toys.  The same video card, by the way, is installed in the sensational <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/asus/blog/96757/">NX90</a> .  In general ... performance is enough for a lot of tasks - from office fuss to movies and toys.  On top of that, the laptop‚Äôs video card can switch automatically, although nVidia‚Äôs Optimus technology allows you to customize this process manually for a separate application. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/889/8d3/3bc/8898d33bc409a0ac5212ec5ccd5d1187.png" alt="image"><br><br>  Apparently, for this reason, the thermal mode of the laptop does not exceed the norm.  The system cooler creates a small noise that will not distract when working. <br><br>  The Bang &amp; Olufsen stereo speakers are really good - they easily sounded my balcony almost equal to quite good desktop speakers.  The sound is clear - perfect for movies, games and a lot of music, but listening to Pendulum is still better with headphones :) It would be great if such speakers were placed in all laptops ... but for now this is not possible due to the fact that for device certification In B &amp; O, a laptop must meet a number of requirements, including the geometry of the model itself.  So there is a good sound only in some models (multimedia series) - they are easy to recognize by the characteristic curves of the case in the area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe speakers. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/5df/922/6f8/5df9226f8b54a6615816ccc797499a85.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  And, of course, the labels Sonic Master and Bang &amp; Olufsen in a prominent place. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/8e7/7af/d74/8e77afd745d2d366b737f5ff8d89d40b.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  There is enough space on the hard disk for everyone - an unusual 640GB Samsung disk from Samsung has been installed with the support of all modern technologies. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/59f/bb0/911/59fbb091186f2d350b13970af3ed97fa.png" alt="image"><br><br>  The linear reading speed is as follows: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/b85/1e6/82b/b851e682bf08d35ffbc04bd35bf04953.png" alt="image"><br><br>  As I said, the laptop supports Bluetooth 3.0.  I did not have a single pairing device; therefore, I tried only what was.  In particular, he messed up a laptop with a HTC HD2 communicator, from which music was played (the laptop was a ‚Äúheadset‚Äù) - the sound was without delay, but with noticeable distortion.  It is unlikely that someone will repeat this experience, but once in life it may be useful) But BT mice work like a clock. <br><br>  On a standard battery (the minimum capacity of those that will be available - 4400mAh, 48Wh), the laptop is able to work (at maximum brightness of the display and with the included Wi-Fi module) for only 1.5 hours. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/330/437/171/3304371718c195f8eddf18453f5ee5dd.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/af2/94a/228/af294a2281f2c106ec7aac2f877a8602.png" alt="image">  <b>Advantages and disadvantages</b> <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/881/117/ccb/881117ccbc836c685868fb19a2bf46c1.png" alt="+">  Neat practical case with a stylish metal cover <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/881/117/ccb/881117ccbc836c685868fb19a2bf46c1.png" alt="+">  High-quality assembly, pleasant body material and around the touchpad <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/881/117/ccb/881117ccbc836c685868fb19a2bf46c1.png" alt="+">  4 USB ports (one 3.0, one combined with eSATA and 2 normal) <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/881/117/ccb/881117ccbc836c685868fb19a2bf46c1.png" alt="+">  Comfortable and quiet keyboard, large touchpad <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/881/117/ccb/881117ccbc836c685868fb19a2bf46c1.png" alt="+">  Modern productive stuffing <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/24f/0ae/920/24f0ae920b085ead2e6d649649177122.png" alt="-">  Glossy screen and frame around it <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/24f/0ae/920/24f0ae920b085ead2e6d649649177122.png" alt="-">  Small resolution, only 1366x768 There are versions from 1920x1080 <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/24f/0ae/920/24f0ae920b085ead2e6d649649177122.png" alt="-">  The speaker grid will clog <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/24f/0ae/920/24f0ae920b085ead2e6d649649177122.png" alt="-">  Short battery life <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/24f/0ae/920/24f0ae920b085ead2e6d649649177122.png" alt="-">  Reasonably high price for top configurations <br><br><h2>  The end </h2><br>  If until recently, I had a UL50Vt model as one of my favorite laptops (one of those that are easy to get on the market) from ASUS, now everything seems to be changing.

But suddenly, about the same level as him, the hero of this review has become - a stylish and powerful laptop.  With a price of up to 35 thousand rubles, the laptop has all the chances to become a worthy assistant for a very wide range of consumers - from home users, to businessmen and businesswomen. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/a4f/5da/de9/a4f5dade9f4c5357caab381bc9b20d2d.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  For those to whom the laptop diagonal seemed small, there is an ‚Äúenlarged‚Äù version - ASUS N73Jn, in which the screen has grown to 17.3 ''.
