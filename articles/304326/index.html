They were treasured and admired, carefully stored and sold for hundreds of millions of dollars, and perhaps not by accident they are the main goal of art thieves.  Their compositions, colors, details, themes can keep us in admiration and attention for hours.  But what about the ratio of their external dimensions - height to width? <br><br>  In 1876, the German scientist <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gustav_Fechner">Gustav Theodor Fechner</a> studied the human perception of rectangular shapes, and then concluded that rectangles with a golden proportion (the same as the <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%2597%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BB%25D0%25BE%25D1%2582%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B5_%25D1%2581%25D0%25B5%25D1%2587%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B5">golden section</a> ) are most pleasing to the human eye.  To test his experimental observations, Fechner also analyzed the ratios of more than ten thousand pictures. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  A little more to learn about Fechner will help us the following code:

We will learn about the tendencies of the last century in the field of aspect ratios and consider how it has become more rationalistic. <br><br><a name="1"></a><h1>  Preface: The golden ratio - a beautiful mathematical concept </h1><br>  Golden ratio œÜ = (1+ <img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/65c/d92/c4e/65cd92c4e1eaff3411919b65d0825306.png">  ) /2‚âà1.618033988‚Ä¶ - a special number in mathematics.

For example, this is the <b>worst approximated</b> irrational number: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/939/368/586/9393685869ecf0d3bfd1a8036dd8713d.png"><br><br>  Here is a graph showing the sequence <b>q ‚àô | q ‚àô œï - round (q ‚àô œï) |</b>  .

It sets the ratio of the shown segments (the red segment has a length of 1 / œÜ, blue - 1). <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/1e0/63d/7c1/1e063d7c13e468976f903b8616f3f308.png"><br><br>  Below are wide and high rectangles with aspect ratios equal to the <b>golden ratio</b> and <b>1 / golden ratio,</b> respectively. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/330/3f0/fcc/3303f0fcc8406156e2b1515be8885890.png"><br><br>  And it is not surprising that such a beautiful number from the point of view of mathematics was often used to create aesthetic forms.  The history of the golden section goes back centuries.  It was mathematically described by Euclid, and the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/De_divina_proportione">famous da Vinci drawings were based on the golden section.</a> <br><br>  The Wolfram Demonstrations Project has <a href="http://www.demonstrations.wolfram.com/search.html%3Fquery%3DGolden%2520Ratio">about ninety interactive documents related to the use of the golden section.</a>  Especially it is worth paying attention to the <a href="http://www.demonstrations.wolfram.com/MonaLisaAndTheGoldenRectangle/"><em>Mona Lisa and the golden rectangle</em></a> , as well as the <a href="http://www.demonstrations.wolfram.com/GoldenSpiral/">golden spiral.</a> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/2a6/18f/7a7/2a618f7a7fb28b2dfa3bf10acb34efce.png"><br><br>  The golden section is often found in nature.  The golden section version for corners is the so-called <b>golden angle</b> , which breaks a circle into two parts, the lengths of which have a ratio equal to the golden section: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/449/91b/458/44991b45810767c9aa6c46b80cc239b9.png"><br><br>  The golden angle, for example, can be found in the <a href="http://www.demonstrations.wolfram.com/search.html%3Fquery%3Dphyllotaxis">phyllotaxis models:</a> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/9d2/1d2/13d/9d21d213dc62616cb1219d689eaa70d8.png"><br><br>  <a href="http://article.sapub.org/10.5923.j.arts.20110101.01.html">M. Akhtaruzzaman and A. Shafie</a> gives a very long list of where the golden section is found in nature and man-made objects. <br><br>  However, the versatility of the golden section in art is often overestimated.  The most popular misconceptions are given in the work for the authorship of <a href="http://www.math.nus.edu.sg/aslaksen/teaching/maa/markowsky.pdf">Markowsky</a> . <br><br>  In the future, we will often encounter the square root of the golden section.  If we also consider complex numbers, then another, fairly simple continued fraction will give the <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/2583103%3Fseq%3D1">square root of the golden ratio in the composition of its real and imaginary part</a> ( <img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/891/b43/ade/891b43ade9a7452f912e7b3e18ac1881.png">  - approx.

After polling 347 people, each of which was offered a choice of 10 rectangles with different aspect ratios, the most popular was with a 34/21 aspect ratio, and this ratio differs from the golden ratio by less than 0.1%.  Below is the cited to this day, but rarely found in publications, a table with the results of Fechner: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/bdd/61f/f79/bdd61ff79caaa4e1d318b7bf5f2752cf.png"><br><br>  In chapter 33 of the second volume, the <b>sizes of the</b> paintings are discussed, in chapter 44 a detailed analysis (on 41 pages) of 10,558 paintings from 22 European galleries is presented.  Interestingly, Fechner discovered that the typical ratio of height and width for painting deviates greatly from the expected golden section. <br><br>  Fechner conducted a detailed analysis of 775 paintings on hunting and military subjects, and a more crude analysis for the remaining 9,783 paintings.  Below are the results for paintings on hunting and military themes ( <b>Genre</b> ), landscapes ( <b>Landschaft</b> ) and still lifes ( <b>Stillleben</b> ).  In the table, the height is denoted as <b>h</b> , and the width as <b>b</b> .  And <b>V.-M.</b>  There is a ratio <b>h / b</b> or <b>b / h</b> : <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/c0c/240/043/c0c2400433464adf8da4ed7af0685828.png"><br><br>  And now, in our days, we can repeat its analysis using modern means and knowledge. <br><br>  McManus ( <a href="http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.2044-8295.1980.tb01763.x/abstract">here</a> and <a href="http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.2044-8295.1980.tb01763.x/abstract">here</a> ) will help you to learn more about the modified versions of the Fechner experiment, <a href="http://psycnet.apa.org/journals/aca/4/2/113/">McManus et al.</a>  , <a href="http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/10400419.2003.9651419">Konecni</a> , <a href="http://www.worldcat.org/title/retention-effects-and-curriculum-implications-of-golden-ration-proportioned-figures/oclc/82359604">Bachmann</a> , <a href="http://psycnet.apa.org/journals/aca/9/1/91/">Stieger and Swami</a> , <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3485848/">Friedenberg</a> , <a href="http://www.perceptionweb.com/abstract.cgi%3Fid%3Dp2787">Ohta</a> , <a href="http://www.perceptionweb.com/abstract.cgi%3Fid%3Dp3037">Russel</a> , <a href="http://www.perceptionjournal.com/abstract.cgi%3Fid%3Dp240937">Green</a> , <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/1423158">Davis and Jahnke</a> , <a href="http://booksandjournals.brillonline.com/content/journals/10.1163/187847510x516412">Phillips et al.</a>  and <a href="http://art.sagepub.com/content/15/2/233.abstract">hoge</a> .  <a href="http://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-319-18836-2_16">Jensen</a> recently analyzed pictures from the CGFA database, but the discrete values ‚Äã‚Äãof height and width used (from analyzing the number of pixels in images) do not allow to obtain a large-scale structure of the distribution of aspect ratios, and even more so to obtain explicit extremes (below we will analyze the test set of images). <br><br>  While Fechner made a detailed analysis of quantitative invariants (means, medians, etc.) for the aspect ratio of the paintings, he did not investigate the general form of the distribution of aspect ratios, as well as the distribution of local maxima in this distribution. <br><br><a name="3"></a><h1>  Easy Start: Artwork Analysis - Wolfram Knowledgebase Knowledge Areas </h1><br>  One of the subject areas of the <a href="http://reference.wolfram.com/language/ref/EntityValue.html/"><b>EntityValue feature</b></a> is " <b>Artwork</b> " (art objects).  Here we can get the names of the works, the names of artists, the dates of completion of works on paintings, as well as the values ‚Äã‚Äãof the width and height of several thousand paintings.  Pictures are available as a feature class from the <b>Artwork area</b> in the Wolfram Knowledgebase (Wolfram Knowledge Base): <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/330/aa8/b58/330aa8b58ba124289566409544909a80.png"><br><br>  Here is a typical example of the data being received: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/9f7/bf4/eeb/9f7bf4eebe75ccdfd8d922bddf1605e9.png"><br><br>  The paintings have the most diverse aspect ratio - there are both very wide and very elongated vertically.  Below is a collage of 36 images of paintings sorted by their aspect ratio (ratio of width to height).  Each image is represented in a gray square with a red border: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/9d3/a36/9ac/9d3a369acc523ed1cef7d655aec395ab.png"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/9a1/3f7/2ea/9a13f72ead9d77291633de3c739d9563.png"><br><br>  Most of the paintings have an aspect ratio in the range from 1/4 to 4.

You can take the average values ‚Äã‚Äãof all colors for each picture and place them on the RGB color triangle: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/ef6/5cd/2cc/ef65cd2cc58699d088cb761c955c68d5.png"><br><br>  Before analyzing the proportions of <b>h / b in</b> more detail, let's consider their product, which will give us the area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe picture.  (In the above-mentioned work of Fechner, much attention was paid to this issue.) <br><br>  Now we will place all the paintings on the plane (horizontally - aspect ratio, vertically - the area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe picture).  Since the size of the pictures vary greatly, we will use the logarithmic scale vertically.  Add also tooltips that will show the picture and its parameters for each of the points: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/82d/998/bbc/82d998bbc70ae5b8932952281d38934e.png"><br><br>  Below is a histogram of aspect ratio distribution. <br><br>  From now on, following the definition in the Wolfram Language, we will assume that <br>  <b>aspect ratio = height / width</b> , <br>  and not vice versa.  As shown above, Fechner adhered to the same definition. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/87f/c3b/a69/87fc3ba690e6539e71697931ad2b523b.png"><br><br>  Let's now look at the aspect ratio histogram in more detail.  The shape of this distribution can be said to be trimodal.  For wide pictures (width&gt; height) the ratio will be less than one, for square pictures the ratio will be near one, and for high pictures (height&gt; width) the ratio will be, respectively, greater than 1. The wide and high pictures give their peaks;  less pronounced local peaks can also be observed. <br><br>  It was not unexpected to get a trimodal structure for wide, tall and square paintings.  In this connection, two questions naturally arise: <br><br>  1) What are the local peak values? <br><br>  2) What is the approximate general form of distribution (normal, lognormal, etc.)? <br><br>  In 1997, <a href="http://art.sagepub.com/content/15/2/165.abstract">Shortess, Clarke and Shannon</a> analyzed 594 pictures and studied in more detail the neighborhood of the maximum point of the distribution.  In accordance with the work of Fechner from 1876, the local maximum of the <b>max</b> distribution <b>(h / b, b / h)</b> lies at point 1.3.  The number 1.3 is clearly different from the golden section and the authors suggest that the value of this maximum is probably either the Pythagorean number (4/3) or the <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%259F%25D0%25BB%25D0%25B0%25D1%2581%25D1%2582%25D0%25B8%25D1%2587%25D0%25B5%25D1%2581%25D0%25BA%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B5_%25D1%2587%25D0%25B8%25D1%2581%25D0%25BB%25D0%25BE">plastic number</a> ( <b>plastic constant</b> , <b>silver section</b> ). <br><br>  <i>The plastic number</i> is a positive real solution of the equation <b>x¬≥ - x - 1 = 0</b> : <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/27d/382/649/27d38264910c5e379237ea5511eb5e86.png"><br><br>  <a href="http://www.nexusjournal.com/the-nexus-conferences/nexus-2002/148-n2002-padovan.html">The plastic constant was introduced by Dom Hans van der Laan in 1928</a> as a special number in the context of the aesthetics of three-dimensional (but not two-dimensional) forms.  The plastic constant represented in the radicals ‚Ñò has a rather complex form: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/f08/2cf/e88/f082cfe880e25f9a0c712ce2cbd4c368.png"><br><br>  The ‚Äúquality‚Äù of the graph, derived from an analysis of 594 pictures, was not enough to distinguish ‚Ñò and 4/3, with the result that Shortess, Clarke and Shannon suggested that the maximum aspect ratio lies in the " <b>platinum constant</b> " (the term they entered), which is approximately equal to 1.3.  In their work, no small details of the structure of the aspect ratio distribution were also found. <br><br>  <b>Note</b> : this ‚Äúplatinum constant‚Äù is not related to the <a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0305048306000454">platinum cross section</a> used in numerical analysis. <br><br>  (There is an interesting mathematical relationship between the golden section and the plastic constant: the golden section is the point of the smallest cluster <a href="http://mathworld.wolfram.com/PisotNumber.html">of Piso numbers</a> , and the plastic constant is the smallest of the Pizo numbers, but we will not touch upon this connection in the future). <br><br>  If we reduce the width of the histogram rectangles, we can see at least two maxima for wide and tall pictures: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/0dc/e51/23d/0dce5123db143a09ba64a284915673e0.png"><br><br>  If we consider the integral distribution function, we can notice that the number of square pictures is quite small.  Square pictures correspond to a small vertical jump with a ratio of sides equal to one: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/cd9/5ed/eb7/cd95edeb7517bc14f359af1d40118d54.png"><br><br>  Let us now compare the distribution of the ratios of the sides of high and wide pictures;  for this, we invert the ‚Äúhigh‚Äù ratios and are compatible with the ‚Äúwide ones‚Äù.  The maxima at points 0.8 (global) and 0.75 (the second maximum) are very well combined: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/157/761/1c5/1577611c55707f548c7cd6c3106fbf80.png"><br><br>  Here is how the smoothed distributions and maxima of the ratios of the sides of wide and inverted high patterns correlate: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/732/0a5/b5d/7320a5b5de6660db8484c409795da2a1.png"><br><br>  The quantile graph below illustrates the similarity of our distributions: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/2c4/b35/905/2c4b359054af1cdb1816685e266f40ab.png"><br><br>  Is it possible to get the maxima in numerical form and associate them with any specific numbers?  Below are the above-mentioned constants and three more extras: the <b>square root of the golden section</b> , <b>5/4</b> and <b>6/5</b> : <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/c6c/0c4/3c6/c6c0c43c6a13e1738dff5ed2c8f90b0f.png"><br><br>  Of all the possible constants, we chose the square root of the golden section for the reason that it naturally appears in the so-called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kepler_triangle">Kepler triangle</a> .  The ratio of its sides is <img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/87b/95e/432/87b95e43232049bf9b7b7cafa1c201c3.png">  : <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/255/674/8f9/2556748f97aa3d580364f069d27327ee.png"><br><br>  The Pythagorean theorem is no less important for the square root of the golden section.  The Kepler triangle becomes the governing equation for the golden section: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/fcc/f59/0aa/fccf590aa0fab7da60d5edfdd135b186.png"><br><br>  Shortess and others included the fraction 4/3 as the Pythagorean constant, since this number is the ratio of the two smallest sides of the Pythagorean triangle with side lengths of 3, 4, 5 (3¬≤ + 4¬≤ = 5¬≤). <br><br>  A fraction of 6/5 was included because, as we will see later, this aspect ratio is often found in the paintings over the past 200 years. <br><br>  The distribution of the aspect ratios in the pictures together with the selected constants shows that the largest peak probably lies in the value of the root from the golden section, and the smaller peak is somewhere in the range 1.32 ... 1.33. <br><br>  Here is a list of constant contenders for the exact value of the maximum.  We use this list in the further analysis of the ratios of the sides in different groups of paintings.  Let's illustrate these relationships: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/b99/496/ca0/b99496ca0a8a5b168f6e7857d3d0603d.png"><br><br>  The graph below shows six constants located on the number line.  The difference between the plastic constant and 4/3 is the smallest among all pairs of six selected constants: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/ddf/db3/5b6/ddfdb35b6bbad72768dc88d8b1e3ce37.png"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/fb6/086/c05/fb6086c05744feab4ba80015544ad2e9.png"><br><br>  Below are the wide rectangles with the aspect ratios of the selected constant values: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/016/29e/c13/01629ec13924b419ba17d676094ee77c.png"><br><br>  For greater clarity, we place these rectangles one above the other: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/931/7f1/4c4/9317f14c48a94033eb62bcfc11ea0926.png"><br><br>  And here is the graph above with the constants marked on the horizontal axis: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/d84/ca5/d75/d84ca5d758204a4171bdb11cd9c5b8a5.png"><br><br>  Other fractions with small denominators will appear in different groups of pictures further, and they can be included according to their aesthetic criteria, as, for example, 55/45 = 11/9 = 1. (2) (see <a href="http://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-662-43407-9_8">here</a> , <a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1748681511004359">here</a> , <a href="http://journals.lww.com/plasreconsurg/Abstract/2014/09000/Population_Analysis_of_the_Perfect_Breast___A.8.aspx">here</a> and <a href="http://synapse.koreamed.org/search.php%3Fwhere%3Daview%26id%3D10.5999/aps.2015.42.2.226%26code%3D2023APS%26vmode%3DFULL">here</a> ) or <a href="https://lirias.kuleuven.be/handle/123456789/439484">27/20 = 1.35</a> , or the so-called <a href="http://archive.bridgesmathart.org/2014/bridges2014-151.pdf">‚Äúmeta-golden section of chi‚Äù</a> - solving the equation <b>Œß¬≤ - X / œÜ = 1</b> with a value of 1.35 ... <br><br>  Since the resolution of the histogram is rather limited, let's calculate the number of pictures that have a certain aspect ratio plus or minus a small deviation.

Interestingly it turns out - their number almost completely coincides: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/c3c/5a0/175/c3c5a0175bf00235f0dbf4d40213c0c3.png"><br><br>  The statistics for all the pictures considered as rectangles (i.e. the <b>maximum</b> aspect ratio <b>(height, width) / minimum (height, width)</b> ) have averages that are very close to the values ‚Äã‚Äãfor tall pictures: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/7a0/aa1/50f/7a0aa150f15a084f7150440638ef6de6.png"><br><br>  As in the above graph with overlaid distributions, the distribution of high paintings almost completely coincides with the distribution for wide paintings, in which the proportions are inverted.  But what is the actual distribution for high (or all) pictures (see question 2 above)?  If we smooth our distribution, ignore the numerous small peaks and use a lower resolution, we could try to compare our distribution with a normal, log-normal, heavy tail (heavy-tailed distribution), etc. <br><br>  To avoid unnecessary noise and artifacts, we will consider only those pictures whose aspect ratio is less than 4: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/f59/740/25d/f5974025dd5b774056c18646bf60eb3b.png"><br><br>  The <a href="http://reference.wolfram.com/language/ref/SmoothKernelDistribution.html/"><b>SmoothKernelDistribution</b></a> function allows <a href="http://reference.wolfram.com/language/ref/SmoothKernelDistribution.html/"><b>you</b></a> to smooth out several maxima and get a smooth distribution (graph on the left).  The risk function constructed in logarithmic (log-log) coordinates <b>(f (a) / (1-F (a)))</b> and the function <b>1 / a</b> give us a hint that the distribution with a heavy tail is the best approximation: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/32b/d79/308/32bd79308b566e89b2f6d56ee6f0a88a.png"><br><br>  Let's see how we can fit (fit) our distribution to normal and lognormal: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/d23/eaf/4a8/d23eaf4a854a7bc687e50335ac00969c.png"><br><br>  But the distribution with a heavy tail: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/fd7/8b0/38e/fd78b038e55b1b3a204a9e838d7c800f.png"><br><br>  Since the height / width ratio has a slowly falling tail, normal, log-normal and extreme distributions ( <i>extreme value distribution</i> ) are bad models.  The range of aspect ratios between 1.4 and 2 clearly indicates this: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/aae/017/364/aae017364ed84b85f14a70fca03ac9b0.png"><br><br>  Four distributions with slowly decreasing tails generally describe our distribution much better: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/7a0/8fc/3fc/7a08fc3fcd3a0e11a33a3b83af162ee0.png"><br><br>  If we quantify our models using a logarithmic measure of similarity, we see that the <b>truncated distribution with a heavy tail</b> is best suited: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/c96/524/10a/c9652410a9a279c2ef034a7982ff0b14.png"><br><br>  The aspect ratio distribution has a curious property: we saw above that the distributions of wide and high pictures after the corresponding transformation are very close in form.  This means that their maxima are at least approximately consistent.  But combining the distribution of <b>p (x)</b> high pictures with <b>0 &lt;x &lt;1</b> and <b>pÃÖ (x) of</b> wide pictures with <b>1 &lt;x &lt;‚àû</b> , will give us that <b>pÃÖ (x) = p (1 / x) / x¬≤</b> .  But at the same time for the highs <img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/774/c0c/0de/774c0c0deb1fd4d42e52be31ad693871.png">  from p ( <b>x</b> ) and <img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/af2/3df/750/af23df75093bcdba6e70d335b8bfaf7f.png">  from <b>pÃÖ</b> ( <b>x</b> ) <img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/774/c0c/0de/774c0c0deb1fd4d42e52be31ad693871.png">  ‚âà1 / <img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/af2/3df/750/af23df75093bcdba6e70d335b8bfaf7f.png">  .  Interestingly, for the parameters found for suitable distribution models, this property holds with an accuracy of 2%.  In the code below, we get the difference in the position of the maxima for the beta simple distribution (beta prime distribution) (the results for stable distributions are almost the same). <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/15f/339/e7b/15f339e7ba8d38e06e3dc1f5c1f6e51d.png"><br><br><a name="5"></a><h1>  Aspect ratios for different centuries, genres and artists </h1><br>  Now the question arises: how did our trimodal distribution change over time, from genre to genre, depending on the artists? <br><br>  Let's consider the dependence on time, grouping the pictures by centuries (they are considered the year of completion of the work on the picture).  It can be noted that from at least the fourteenth century, tall paintings often had an aspect ratio of about 1.3, broad pictures had an aspect ratio of about 0.76, and square pictures became popular only relatively recently.  You can also see that for high paintings the distribution has a flatter form in the sixteenth, seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, when compared with the distribution for the nineteenth century (we will see similar trends in other collections of paintings): <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/5b1/ca1/88e/5b1ca188e5ef5acd15319b05d73afa5b.png"><br><br>  The median of the ratio of the sides of all the pictures has decreased over the past 500 years and became equal to slightly more than 1.3.  (here we define the aspect ratio as the ratio of the length of the longer side to the smaller side).  The average has also decreased and seems to be fixed at 1.35: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/30b/054/98b/30b05498b613a8ba6653444e1619c7ff.png"><br><br>  For comparison, here is the distribution of the area of ‚Äã‚Äãpaintings (in square meters) and how it has changed over the centuries: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/af0/b16/bb1/af0b16bb1c5465878dd37d056c87ac54.png"><br><br>  For the last 450 years, the median area of ‚Äã‚Äãpaintings has been very stable and was about 2 m <sup>2</sup> : <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/ad4/fbd/c73/ad4fbdc736947b3cdab4732bd1e7647a.png"><br><br>  And what about the ratios in different artistic trends?  <a href="http://www.wikigallery.org/">WikiGallery</a> contains very visual information about the <a href="http://www.wikigallery.org/wiki/Movements">trends in the visual arts.</a>  We import the page and get a list of directions, as well as how many pictures in each of them are presented: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/d44/b38/3d6/d44b383d64d1d7570376b1941163f1f9.png"><br><br>  Unfortunately, the size information is not available for all paintings.  Importing all pages with pictures and extracting data on height and width from the thumbnail size allows building distributions of proportions for each style or genre with varying accuracy. <br><br>  The overwhelming majority of directions demonstrate pronounced bimodal distributions with peaks in aspect ratios of about 1.3 and 0.76 (the directions are sorted by the total number of pictures presented on the corresponding Wiki pages). <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/c1c/92f/172/c1c92f1723147e87bcfdbf98e7bc8ffc.png"><br><br>  Let's use Wikipedia again and consider the aspect ratios of various artists: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/163/390/094/163390094ae237d4572ba95c48c25d51.png"><br><br>  And even if the total number of pictures per histogram is now significantly less, we can still detect the bimodal (for square pictures peak disappeared) form of distribution.  And again you can see pronounced maxima at points 1.3 for high and 0.76 for wide pictures. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/45a/6de/7c9/45a6de7c99fdd75a282769d818c21544.png"><br><br>  Again the distributions contain sharp peaks.  <a href="http://www.nationalgallery.org.uk/upload/rtf/reissner_2008.rtf">Some artists, such as Cezanne, preferred the standard canvas dimensions</a> (for a more detailed study of the canvas sizes that Francis Bacon used, see <a href="http://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/4148915.pdf">here)</a> . <br><br>  Let's also look at a more contemporary artist, <a href="http://thomaskinkade.com/">Thomas Kinkade</a> , the "artist of light."  Modern paintings use standard materials and are implemented in certain sizes and aspect ratios, so that the shape and size of the picture are largely determined by standards rather than aesthetics.  Therefore, this time we will be guided not by text data about the image, but by the images themselves, receiving data about their sizes based on their pixel resolution.  Even if you use miniatures, the distribution of the aspect ratio will be quite correct: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/486/6e6/fe7/4866e6fe744ae95efca28b27dee2bbd8.png"><br><br>  In addition to our typical maximum of ~ 1.3, we can observe a pronounced maximum of about 3/2 - very likely, this is an artifact of standardization: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/7f0/676/b2d/7f0676b2d09f90dff84ddf1d84b3f64a.png"><br><br><a name="6"></a><h1>  Analyzing five old German museum catalogs </h1><br>  The above histograms show at least two maxima for high pictures, as well as two maxima for wide pictures, with a large peak next to the square root of the golden section.  Since we do not know what the selection criteria were for the artwork included in <b>‚ÄúArtwork‚Äù</b> - the area of <a href="http://reference.wolfram.com/language/ref/Entity.html"><b>Entity</b></a> - we must test our hypothesis on some independent collections of pictures. <br><br>  An accessible source for the size of the paintings are museum catalogs.  Various old catalogs, similar to those used by Fechner, are available in scanned and recognized forms.

In different catalogs, the length and width of pictures may be presented in different ways, but within the same catalog, usually these parameters are contained in one form.  As a result, looking at the form in which the data is presented, it is not a daunting task to retrieve the size data using string patterns. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/ae9/4a9/cbc/ae94a9cbc966895123d0f2678cc82e6f.png"><br><br>  <b><a href="http://www.smb.museum/en/museums-and-institutions/bode-museum/home.html">Catalog of the Kaiser Friedrich</a> Museum (now the Bode Museum):</b> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/de8/d7c/67c/de8d7c67c5a44526332d9dc5596760ee.png"><br><br>  <b><a href="http://www.pinakothek.de/en/alte-pinakothek">Catalog of the Pinakothek in Munich</a> (now the Old Pinakothek):</b> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/a94/25b/600/a9425b600d7acbbef57e615ecb05698c.png"><br><br>  <b><a href="https://www.stuttgart.de/item/show/305802/1/dept/108749%3F">Catalog from the museum der bildenden K√ºnste zu Stuttgart</a> (now the State Gallery of Stuttgart):</b> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/5c1/341/492/5c1341492a3c920293cf41f96cfb5623.png"><br><br>  <b><a href="http://www.skd.museum/en/museen-institutionen/zwinger-mit-semperbau/gemaeldegalerie-alte-meister/">Catalog from the Gem√§ldegalerie in Dresden</a> (now the Old Masters Gallery of Dresden):</b> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/6b7/383/a9e/6b7383a9ef0709239bfa636c6d81492b.png"><br><br>  <b><a href="http://www.museum-kassel.de/index_navi.php%3Fparent%3D1058">Gem√§ldegalerie zu Cassel catalog</a> (now Neue Galerie Kassel):</b> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/d59/a8d/205/d59a8d20528328d8f6ca01b078707378.png"><br><br>  For all five museums, the results are very similar: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/7b9/3c7/721/7b93c772107c041ce47b32b4b8b95669.png"><br><br>  Add new data from these five directories and build it all together with constants marked with vertical lines: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/479/7dc/e3d/4797dce3d379f135a8e830ee2944c0d4.png"><br><br>  And again we see two global maxima in the distribution of aspect ratios.

In France, the first standardization occurred in the seventeenth century, and the second - in the nineteenth (for recent times and with a lot of mathematics, see the work of <a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/1508.00718v2">Dinh Dang</a> ).  <a href="http://www.npg.org.uk/research/programmes/artists-their-materials-and-suppliers/three-quarters-kit-cats-and-half-lengths-british-portrait-painters-and-their-canvas-sizes-1625-1850/2.-four-historic-sizes.php">Simon</a> discusses canvas standardization in the UK. <br><br>  Here are the sizes for some standardized nineteenth-century French canvases.  Data in format <br>  { <b>width</b> , { <b>height of portrait</b> , <b>height of landscape</b> , <b>height of marina (sea landscape)</b> }}: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/7f1/e2f/814/7f1e2f8148c53479202b7d11672cb45c.png"><br><br>  Aspect ratios ( <b>maximum (height / width, width / height)</b> ) for all webs have the following distribution: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/78e/938/869/78e938869ad69efcace72d50b1acd448.png"><br><br>  It is not easy to find large and accurate sets of data on the size of old paintings.  On the other hand, various websites have tens of thousands of pictures of pictures in both JPG and PNG.  Maybe the aspect ratio is simply calculated through the ratio of the number of pixels in width and height?  We have seen above that most of the paintings are measured to an accuracy of about one centimeter.  With an average height and width of paintings of about one meter, we get an error of about 2%.  Even thumbnails are approximately 100 pixels in size or a few hundred pixels wide / high.  Thus, one would again expect results that are accurate to exactly 1..2%.  But there is no guarantee that the images were not cropped, that the frame was included in the size, or there are border pixels or not.  The web art gallery has, in addition to the actual size of the paintings, their images.  After downloading the images and calculating the aspect ratios, we will try to compare them with the ratios calculated on the basis of real heights and widths of the pictures.  Here is the final distribution of two ratios (pictures and their images) together, as well as the model of this distribution, presented as <b>CauchyDistribution [1.003, 0.019]</b> .  The average value from two pixel measurements is 1.036, the standard deviation is 0.38.  These numbers indicate that the error from using images to determine the aspect ratio is too large to properly convey the small-scale distribution structure: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/9f8/5b4/268/9f85b42688314a1f9a184bd217d7e775.png"><br><br>  <b>DataWGA</b> data <b>also</b> stores information about artists.  Does the average ratio of sizes in the paintings during the life of the artist?  Here is the distribution of the ratio of paintings in the course of the life of artists: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/466/166/eba/466166eba46732723cf8d7764d10e916.png"><br><br>  We can see a general pattern of changes in the average aspect ratio for the artist‚Äôs paintings depending on his age.  The first pictures are statistically more extreme proportions.  At the end of the first third of life the aspect ratio is minimal, and at the end of the second third the aspect ratio is maximum (left graph).  The cumulative average aspect ratio shows a minimum of ~ 0.4 of the life span of the painters (the graph on the right).  Both graphs show the <b>maximum (height / width, width / height)</b> divided by the average of all aspect ratios.  (The connection between creativity and age is discussed <a href="http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/10400419209534436">here</a> ). <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/23c/22f/b1e/23c22fb1e2f188f6f08e8aff8bd05a30.png"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/613/732/cb2/613732cb2210e8f4be910e5ff262dffa.png"><br><br>  The reader, if desired, can independently conduct more accurate measurements of some pictures;  in the meantime, we will do some calculations with the data on the web gallery of fine arts.  Let's also calculate and visualize the distribution of paintings in the world.  We take the current cities in which the paintings are located (which contain data on the width and height), as their positions, take the average of all the paintings in this city and present the <b>maximum (height / width, width / height)</b> as a function of the city.  It is not surprising that the majority of large collections of paintings do not deviate strongly from the median of 1.333.  To find cities and work with their locations, we will use the <a href="http://reference.wolfram.com/language/ref/Interpreter.html"><b>Interpreter</b></a> function: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/40b/559/512/40b559512821b4f21c97d7e0572670d8.png"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/48a/335/97c/48a33597c63b24dbf22193a33f8585b4.png"><br><br><a name="11"></a><h1>  Note II: the importance of accuracy in measurements </h1><br>  Let's examine more closely the width and height values.  If we construct a diagram for fractional centimeters, we clearly see that the vast majority of paintings are measured with an accuracy of less than 1 cm. Only about 10% of all paintings contain size data indicated in millimeters (and some of those indicated to within 5 millimeters probably also rounded): <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/762/c2d/d76/762c2dd762dc3d0c04ebf5be168a3ca9.png"><br><br>  Let's examine more closely the width and height values.  Since most of the paintings were written before the centimeter was introduced as a unit of measurement, popular sizes in painting probably should not be a multiple of a centimeter.  This means that the measured values ‚Äã‚Äãof heights and widths are not actual values.  He consoles only a very homogeneous distribution of millimeter parts of the sizes of the paintings, which were measured with an accuracy of one millimeter. <br><br>  In many of the analyzed data sets, the width and height of the picture are represented as integers and in centimeters.  (The obvious exception is the data set from the Tate collection, in which practically every picture is measured to the millimeter accuracy).  Since the widths and heights of most paintings are in the same order as 100 cm, to accurately determine the aspect ratio, rounding to the centimeter is a tangible operation.  How many of the observed maxima for different fractions with small denominators are the result of inaccurate values ‚Äã‚Äãof widths and heights? <br><br>  Let's model this effect.  The <b>aspectRatioModelValue</b> function models the aspect ratio of pictures.  We assume a stable distribution of widths and the fact that the distribution of heights is a normal distribution with an average value of <b>1.3 xwidth</b> .  And we will model only tall pictures, limiting the height so that the height is not less than the width: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/604/141/620/604141620fe1e284f9c47d5b156d6517.png"><br><br>  Now we ‚Äúcut out the canvases‚Äù for tall paintings and look at the distribution of proportions.  We do this twice for each of the 100,000 paintings.  The upper graph contains the distribution obtained by using dimensions exactly up to millimeters.  The graph below shows that in 65% of all cases, measurements are accurate to a centimeter, 25% to half a centimeter, and 10% to a millimeter.  For each of the results of three computational experiments, we impose a histogram of the resulting distribution: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/075/c15/2fc/075c152fc23468dce27e30c08ab70981.png"><br><br>  A comparison of the upper and lower graphs tells us that the distribution of the aspect ratio is quite smooth if the measurements are accurate to a millimeter.  The lower distribution contains artifacts caused by measurement accuracy to centimeters. <br><br>  Looking at a fairly smooth histogram for millimeter precision values ‚Äã‚Äãand the above histogram of aspect ratios for the Tate collection, one can see that the frequent occurrences of ratios that can be represented as simple fractions are a real effect.  At the same time, as shown in the above experiment with weights {0.65, 0.25, 0.10}, rounding to centimeters artificially enhances the effect of some simple fractions, such as 6/5, 5/4, and 3/2 . <br><br>  An even simpler way to demonstrate the effect of rounding errors when measuring aspect ratios in a data set of a web gallery of fine arts is to change the width and height values.  We will add from -5 mm to 5 mm to each integer size to simulate a more accurate measurement.  Again, as the aspect ratio we will use the ratio of the larger side to the smaller: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/d56/850/61c/d5685061c415e46d180efbc66112ea7f.png"><br><br>  Now we impose the initial distribution on the changed one - where we changed the values ‚Äã‚Äãof the widths and heights.  We see that the maxima on some rational ratios are strongly suppressed, but the global maximum of about 5/4 does not change its position, the second maximum, 4/3, is also stable, as well as the small first maximum, 6/5.  At the same time, the peaks by 3/2 and 2 lose a lot in height: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/eb5/c8e/188/eb5c8e18849b84b0f4586b04aa1a544a.png"><br><br>  We do everything in reverse order with the Tate collection dataset: round up all the widths and heights up to a centimeter.  Again, let's build the initial distribution of the ratio of the sides together with the changed: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/94f/1e4/1f6/94f1e41f61af9889b45763306a531be7.png"><br><br>  While the heights of the local peaks have changed, the largest peaks are still present, moreover, very pronounced. <br><br><a name="12"></a><h1>  WikiArt: another major web resource </h1><br>  Let's look at another major web resource - <a href="http://www.wikiart.org/">WikiArt.</a>  For computing tasks this site is very conveniently structured.  We have a <a href="http://www.wikiart.org/en/alphabet">list of 900+ artists</a> with hyperlinks to pages with their works.  Each picture has its own page, which contains conveniently structured information.  Here, for example, information about the picture <b>Mona Lisa:</b> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/405/fcc/6d6/405fcc6d6c2b94aa19046c3cc898464b.png"><br><br>  Note that the above data contains information about the style and genre.  This implies the use of the WikiArt dataset to search for possible dependencies of formats on a genre (we have already examined the styles above). <br><br>  There are about 7000 pictures in the data set with information about their sizes.  For brevity, all data has been encoded as a single black and white image: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/7d9/1a6/ed6/7d91a6ed61276a286a4f0a2b149783bf.png"><br><br>  Pictures with information about the sizes have the following distribution according to their age.  You can see the prevailing number of paintings from the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/036/cf0/e3c/036cf0e3c12c81b83507ee6b2f954280.png"><br><br>  Based on the results obtained earlier, it can be expected that this data set, which is dominated by pictures of the last one and a half centuries, will have distinct peaks on the aspect ratios, which correspond to some fractions.  The distribution below with vertical lines at 6/5, 5/4, 4/3 and 3/2 confirms this hypothesis: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/cb8/5e3/a82/cb85e3a82abee7663ca6aef0132660c1.png"><br><br>  The genre is obviously closely connected with the format of the picture - whether it will be wide, square or high.  Here are the proportions of broad, square and tall pictures for various genres: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/746/1a9/45e/7461a945e8f9e667bc9d795c8936fa04.png"><br><br>  Let's now consider the distribution of aspect ratios as a function of the genre: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/041/5d8/bd3/0415d8bd3462d0d53d46610815e818d4.png"><br><br>  Using the <a href="http://reference.wolfram.com/language/ref/TimelinePlot.html"><b>TimelinePlot</b></a> function, we plot the ranges of the second and third quartile relations: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/3d1/7f3/0ed/3d17f30edc1a96f565c3e98553ff51f7.png"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/13b/787/25f/13b78725f888e1865f564b1de11b7354.png"><br><br>  Tall paintings in landscapes are much less common than wide ones.  But even if by the aspect ratio we mean the ratio of the long side to the short side, then we will still see a clear dependence of the proportions on the genre. <br><br>  The genre often also affects the size of the picture itself.  Here are the second and third quartiles in the aspect ratios and areas for different genres (in the attached Mathematica document, this picture is interactive: move the cursor to an opaque rectangle to see the genre): <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/548/d82/4d7/548d824d75146f354ebc2efd96e42e5d.png"><br><br>  If we divide each genre by style, we get a more fine-grained structure of the distribution of aspect ratios.  Choose the 50 most popular genres and styles, each of which must be represented by at least fifty pictures: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/481/d98/8b4/481d988b43640e347977eb3c7dd4c4cc.png"><br><br>  Neoclassical nude paintings stand out for their largest average aspect ratio (around 1.86): <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/84f/c87/659/84fc87659ce6e2a95f3df2696cc97b90.png"><br><br>  And here is a more detailed diagram showing average aspect ratios for various styles and genres that contain at least five pictures.

Not all of them are paintings that are hung on the wall;  The collection also includes paintings on porcelain figurines and other surfaces.  Total ~ 31000 paintings with clearly defined sizes.  Since the information about the paintings comes from several museums, sizes can be presented in various formats.  It will take some time to retrieve the dimensions. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/b07/d61/fea/b07d61feaa910ad92d7941af721fa4e0.png"><br><br>  Interestingly, here we get a new maximum equal to ~ 1.23. <br><br>  The display of the distribution of wide images on it for high images with height replacement by width shows that the two maxima match very well.

Let us show the distribution together with the lines at 1, 6/5, 5/4, 4/3, 7/5, 3/2, 5/3 and 2.

And all the highs fall on fractions with small denominators.  And this is despite the fact that only about 8% of the total number of paintings are measured with an error of less than half a centimeter. <br><br><a name="15"></a><h1>  Smithsonian collection </h1><br>  <a href="http://siris-artinventories.si.edu/ipac20/ipac.jsp%3Fprofile%3D">Smithsonian Museum of American Art</a> has a website with which you can explore a large number of paintings.

Five of the most pronounced highs for high pictures fall on fractions with small denominators.  Let us draw the numbers 6/5, 5/4, 9/7, 4/3, 3/2 as their vertical lines, and their inverse values.

The question arises: what is the most popular ratio today? <br><br>  There is no such museum, which has thousands of paintings in recent years (at least I could not find one).  So, let's pay attention to the dealers of modern paintings (the last few decades).  After some searching I went to <a href="http://www.saatchiart.com/">Saatchi Art</a> .  Search in <a href="http://www.saatchiart.com/all%3Fquery%3Doil">oil paintings</a> , issued 96,000 paintings.  So what are their ratios?  Here is a graph with the distribution of their proportions.

Was the transition caused by aesthetic reasons, or due to the peculiarities of industrial production and standardization?  We leave this question to art historians. <br><br>  For a clearer answer to the question of whether the maxima correspond to certain known constants (the square root of the golden section, the plastic constant, 4/3 or 5/4), more accurate data on the size of eighteenth-century paintings is needed.  Many catalogs give dimensions without specifying the measurement accuracy and whether the frame is in the indicated dimensions.  The measurement accuracy is most often equal to a centimeter.  With typical picture sizes of about one hundred centimeters, rounding up to a centimeter introduces a certain amount of distortion to the distribution.  On the other hand, the use of images for the analysis of aspect ratio is not possible, since the errors caused by clipping and perspective distortions are too large.  We intentionally did not combine data from different collections.  In addition to the question of identifying duplicates, it would be necessary to carefully examine whether the dimensions are indicated with a frame or not, as well as to investigate in greater detail the question of the accuracy of measurements of the indicated dimensions.  Such an expert art critic should be carried out very carefully. <br><br>  One large collection, which we did not include in the study, can be useful in determining the exact maximum values ‚Äã‚Äãof the distribution of aspect ratios for 178,000 old paintings of the online catalog of 645 museums from Germany, Austria and Switzerland that <a href="http://www.degruyter.com/view/db/gim">De Gruyter</a> published on the Internet At the time of writing this article to me Could not get permission to access data from this directory.  (There are also various small databases of pictures, including <a href="http://www.lostart.de/Webs/EN/Datenbank/Index.html%3Bjsessionid%3D4DEB68CAF9ACE263F06A844E187E90ED.m0">lost ones</a> , which can be analyzed, but they will probably give results similar to those obtained by us). <br><br>  Interestingly, recent studies show that not only humans, but also other mammals, probably prefer proportions around 1.2 (see a recent study by <a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0166432815000972">Winn√© et al.</a> ). <br><br>  Images of paintings can be used for a wide variety of quantitative studies - for example, analyzing the <a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0042698910002129">spectral distribution of the power of spatial frequencies, which are the Fourier components of colors and brightness</a> , <a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0042698908003039">analysis of lightness and directions</a> , structure and composition ( <a href="http://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/b97567">here</a> , <a href="http://www.springer.com/us/book/9783211357392">here</a> , <a href="http://booksandjournals.brillonline.com/content/journals/10.1163/156856808784532563">here</a> ), <a href="http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.2753/RPO1061-0405380364">psychological bases of color structures</a> , and <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1505.00855">automatic classification</a> .  If time permits, we will conduct similar research in the future.  <a href="http://fivethirtyeight.com/features/a-nerds-guide-to-the-2229-paintings-at-moma/">A very entertaining study of a</a> large number of aspects of 2229 paintings in MoMA was conducted by Roder. <br><br>  And, of course, you can analyze in a similar way a variety of man-made objects, find out how often the golden section appears in different areas - in <a href="http://www.astonmartin.com/en-us/cars/the-new-db9/db9-design">cars</a> , for example.  Aspect ratios can be explored in the modern extension of the concept of paintings - in <a href="http://www.idosi.org/wasj/wasj32(1)14/7.pdf">graffiti</a> .  You can analyze the very content of the picture, to look at the frequency of occurrence of the golden section (see <a href="http://www.goldennumber.net/art-composition-design">here</a> and <a href="http://www.pnas.org/content/112/25/7619.extract">here</a> ).
