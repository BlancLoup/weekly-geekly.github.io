  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Customs moved to action</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Actually from the <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/198706/">words</a> about the tax on purchases and reducing the burden on customs with mail, state.  organs are moving to action.  Since January 4, the FCS has tightened the requirements for the import of parcels, adding the need to provide a bunch of papers <s>and go through the honey.</s>  <s>commission</s> . <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  So, what is needed now is to buy abroad with shipment: a copy of a passport with registration, an order from an online store, a photo of the goods ordered, as well as original contract for the provision of customs declaration services and a copy of a bank card.  In addition, you now need to order only to your registration address, and if the order is placed at another address or paid for with another person‚Äôs card, you will have to write an explanatory note. <br><br>  It is not at all clear how the process of receiving parcels will now look almost.  If earlier such a package of documents was required for questions from the customs to the recipient of the parcel, then it is now assumed that everyone will need to come to the customs post before the parcel is missed.  The same clause on the provision of "original contract for the provision of customs declaration services" apparently requires the use of a customs broker, of course, with separate payment for its services.  If you can somehow explain the need to provide a passport, photos of goods and extracts from online stores, then the need to provide a copy of the card (I would not be surprised if the card is asked to be copied from both sides so that the number is also CVV2) I don‚Äôt know how to explain (except that then sell information about the cards or to ensure the possibility of leakage of this information in the process of another hacking).  There is only an option about the fight with the use of stolen cards, but this, as it seems to me the reason with a stretch. <br><br>  Such a package of documents + the need for their delivery to the customs post (where the queues themselves will appear) already discourages ordering something.  But I think that those who still continue to order will create a tangible burden on customs with the reception of citizens and the processing of their documents, which in our country do not prepare in advance by themselves.  As a result, I can assume this problem will be used as an additional justification for the imposition of a tax on parcels.  It seems like the number of ordering will still be reduced, and they will collect some money for the added trouble of customs.

      Such quick steps, as usual in Russia arise, after the words of the first persons of the state.  So it was here, in December, if I am not mistaken, the president demanded to bring order to illegal commerce through the import of parcels from abroad.  Well, actually zealously took up the execution, and apparently this way they are trying to identify illegal entrepreneurs. <br><br>  <a href="http://lenta.ru/news/2014/01/15/control/">The source</a> and another <a href="http://kommersant.ru/doc/2384065">link</a> on the topic.  Apparently, an explanation should follow, how and where all these documents will be accepted.  We are waiting for the development of delirium ... <br><br>  <b>UPD.</b>  As noted in the comments, there is no indication that it is always necessary to provide these documents, that is, there is a chance that these documents will not be required for all parcels, but only in the case of questions from customs officers to the recipient.  But in any case, it remains to hope for a clear explanation from the FCS. <br><br>  <b>UPD 2. The</b> question has received quite a strong response in the media.  As a result, the customs <a href="http://www.customs.ru/index.php%3Foption%3Dcom_content%26view%3Darticle%26id%3D18739:2014-01-15-12-56-03%26catid%3D40:2011-01-24-15-02-45%26Itemid%3D2094%26Itemid%3D1835">explained</a> this issue, where I assert that nothing has changed.  At the same time, in the comments, many Habro users note that courier services (in particular, DHL appears) are requesting a new set of documents for customs clearance with reference to the new customs rules.  While there are clarifications on who first began, it seems that this measure so far affects only courier delivery methods. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/209156/">https://habr.com/ru/post/209156/</a></p>
