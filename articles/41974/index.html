  <section class="page js-page"><h1>E-commerce: you need to prepare a crisis pie together</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  The fourth annual <a href="http://conf.oborot.ru/">e-commerce</a> conference on Thursday opened with a three-hour round table devoted entirely to the financial crisis and its possible consequences for the industry.  Regarding the consequences, the opinions of the participants diverged: ‚ÄúI suggest that we continue to live on credit and not give away - they will go bankrupt and will not look for you‚Äù from eHouse Vice President Andrei Khromov until ‚Äúthanks to the crisis, we will improve and improve the quality of service‚Äù marketing Director of Softkey Tatiana Tsvetkova. <br><br>  But the general vector of discussions of the first day of the conference inexorably rushed towards a continuous positive, which will bring a crisis to e-commerce.  Fedor Virin, who leads research at Mail.ru and the Internet and Business Association (AIB), showed a presentation that fixed an assembly point for those who are ready to prepare for the crisis.  Sooner or later, Fedor believes, the ‚Äúlong shoulder‚Äù of the crisis will hit both medium and small e-business.  But the good news is that people will not stop buying on the Internet and will not change the usual shopping.  They just die their habits for expensive goods. <br><br>  A recipe for the ‚Äúanti-crisis pie‚Äù was also proposed: uniting, popularizing e-commerce among the masses, fighting for new ones and retaining old customers through working on the quality of services and, finally, willingness to jump into the wave of recovery that should come after a recession.  In the fact that market players need to consolidate, Virina is supported by AIB President Alexey Belyaev. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  However, neither the rise nor the decline, while there is not even on the horizon (if we assume the horizon the season of the new year holidays).  Alexey Basov, who is ‚Äúa little bit‚Äú runner, ‚Äùa little bit to Finam‚Äù, says that the companies from the investment fund portfolio continue to grow, and indeed they have no crisis at all.  The recession can affect only large businesses that operate with large amounts of borrowed funds.  In the real economy, and among relatively small e-merchants, ‚Äúnothing will happen,‚Äù he adds.

      Roman Gorshkov, head of the online business "Eldorado", also believes that at least until the New Year, you can continue to work quietly.  And then there will be a chance to ‚Äúeat off the share of offline stores‚Äù, due to the stagnation of the latter.  Here, the president of <a href="http://www.ratek.org/" title="Russian Association of Trading Companies and Commodity Producers of Household and Computer Equipment">RATEK,</a> Alexander Onischuk, agrees with him: ‚Äú <a href="http://www.ratek.org/" title="Russian Association of Trading Companies and Commodity Producers of Household and Computer Equipment">With the</a> shortage of funds, the pace of expansion of retail chains will definitely slow down, which will have a positive effect on online. <br><br><h5>  "But the money is ahead!" </h5><br>  As for electronic means of payment (EPS), the crisis will not affect them in any way, because they are ‚Äúnot communicating with the banking system of the vessels,‚Äù said Peter Darakhvelidze, director of external relations for Webmoney Transfer.  ‚ÄúWe have zero credit debt, we are fully prepaid,‚Äù he explained his position. <br><br>  ‚ÄúAnd credit cards will be bad for them,‚Äù he rolled the traditional barrel from Webmoney into the garden of cards.  ‚ÄúNow electronic money is considered such a surrogate.  And when a cardholder cannot pay it, then this real money will become a surrogate. ‚Äù <br><br>  With Peter, however, would not agree to the participants of the round table, entirely devoted to payment systems.  Post about it - a little later. <br><br><h5>  Peace, Labor, Cuts </h5><br>  Throughout the entire round table, there was probably not a single speaker who would not rather rub his hands in anticipation of the appearance on the market of a huge amount of free labor.  Programmers, layout designers, designers, etc., who have been cut short, will line up for each vacancy in the surviving companies.  And those, in turn, will finally be able to lower wage rates and thereby significantly reduce costs.  Not to mention the fact that the long-standing holes in the states are filled, because of which many promising projects stand idle. <br><br>  Such a picture is drawn, for example, by Alexander Galunov from Books.ru and Tatyana Tsvetkova.  Galunov, who survived the crisis of 1998 with his business, now feels clearly more confident.  And his younger colleagues, who also intend to play the mass unemployment card, are most likely simply ignorant of what happened after Black Monday 10 years ago. <br><br><h5>  Trade engine </h5><br>  Contextual advertising, advertising with payment for the result, can also change its landscape.  Nikolai Popkov from SU Advertising is sure that everything will remain as is with her.  But Andrei Khromov believes that pay-per-click rates may fall.  This will happen due to the fact that advertisers, who today do not really monitor the effectiveness of ad placement, will reconsider their habits and give up on the ‚Äúprinciple of advertising‚Äù, which performs any functions, but does not sell anything. <br><br>  Alexey Basov, who generally agrees that contextual advertisements will leave those who use it for purposes other than intended (but to increase attendance, core sites, etc.), does not foresee a serious drop in the cost of a click. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/41974/">https://habr.com/ru/post/41974/</a></p>
