Standard procedure, at achievement of certain turns.  POIS requires account holder <a href="https://money.yandex.ru/security/identification/">identification</a> .  At the time of this ‚Äúpleasant‚Äù procedure, a new account was opened which was also identified.  A new account remained in the billing system, the old one was successfully scored and forgotten. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br><h4>  Our days. </h4><br>  One of the old customers, without looking at the information contained in the invoice, transfers money to the old account, after a few days writes an angry letter to tech support that the money is not credited.  In the process, it turns out that access to the old account is not worth it.  A day later, access is restored, funds are credited to the client.  When you try to transfer from the old account to the new poison, it spits the error "The movement of money in this direction is prohibited."  We send a request to the technical support of nuclear weapons, and we get an interesting answer:

      <i>Hello.</i> <i><br><br></i>  <i>The account operations on the virtual account ############# are suspended in accordance with clause 4.6.2.5 of the Agreement on the use of the Yandex.Money System.</i> <i><br></i>  <i>Please note that transactions are suspended temporarily, pending consideration of your application.</i> <i><br><br></i>  <i>The Yandex.Money System user mistakenly credited the following payment to your account:</i> <i><br><br></i>  <i>Amount: 1418.59</i> <i><br></i>  <i>Date: 2009-12-15 16:45:48</i> <i><br><br></i>  <i>If you do not mind the return of funds to payers, you need to fill out an application for voluntary refund (form zayavlenie_vozvrat_f6-1, form in the application).</i> <i><br></i>  <i>Please note that when making a refund, your virtual account will be closed, so the application must specify the account number to which we will credit the balance after the returns.</i> <i><br><br></i>  <i>If you object to returning funds to a user who has mistakenly credited a payment to your account, then Yandex.Money company in accordance with clause 9.2.1.</i>  <i>terminate the contract with you.</i> <i><br></i>  <i>According to clause 9.2.1 of the ‚ÄúAgreement on the use of the Yandex.Money System‚Äù, the agreement may be terminated at the initiative of the user and / or the System Operator at any time.</i> <i><br></i>  <i>The initiator of the termination of the contract shall send the appropriate notice to the other party.</i> <i><br></i>  <i>The contract is considered to be terminated ten days after the receipt of the said notice.</i> <i><br></i>  <i>To return the funds accounted for in your virtual account, you will need to submit an application according to the sample (form zayavlenie_rastor_f10-1, application form).</i> <i><br><br></i>  <i>You can bring one of the applications in person to the Yandex.Money System representative office.</i> <i><br><br></i>  <i>Addresses of representative offices are listed on our website:</i> <i><br></i>  <i><a href="">money.yandex.ru/doc.xml?id=157622</a></i> <i><br><br></i>  <i>You should have a passport or military ID with you.</i> <i><br></i>  <i>If you are unable to come in person, you need to notarize your signature on the application and send this application by mail (by registered letter) to OOO Yandex.Money Payment Service at:</i> <i><br><br></i>  <i>117393, Moscow, PO Box 273, OOO PS Yandex.Money</i> <i><br><br></i>  <i>The term of consideration of the application is 20 working days for applying for a voluntary refund and 10 working days for termination of the contract - from the moment the applications are received.</i> <i><br></i>  <i>Please note that the application should be sent by mail only to the mailbox, and by express mail and courier delivery to the address of the Moscow office.</i> <i><br></i>  <i>Applications without notarization of signature signed by mail or courier delivery are not considered.</i> <i><br></i>  <i>Applications from minors are accepted only in the presence of parents or with the provision of their notarized written consent to use the System.</i> <i><br><br></i>  <i>Thank you for your request.</i> <br><br><h4>  There are questions: </h4><br>  <b>1. Why not notifying the identified user, his account is blocked?</b> <b><br></b>  <b>2. Why can not you just return the money by clicking in the interface?</b> <b><br></b>  <b>3. why in this situation a client with a large turnover of nuclear weapons is trying to oust without giving an opportunity to resolve the problem with the payer?</b> <b><br></b>  <b>4. Why should the client of the Poison drop everything and run headlong to the office of the Poison with the passport and application?</b> <br><br>  And there is a conclusion that for 10 rubles you can close the store of poison and create trouble for him. <br><br>  The answer from tech support to all these questions was simple: <br>  <i>Hello.</i> <i><br><br></i>  <i>If you are unable to come in person, you need to notarize your signature on the application and send this application by mail (by registered letter) to OOO Yandex.Money Payment Service at:</i> <i><br><br></i>  <i>117393, Moscow, PO Box 273, OOO PS Yandex.Money</i> <i><br><br></i>  <i>The term of consideration of the application is 20 working days for applying for a voluntary refund and 10 working days for termination of the contract - from the moment the applications are received.</i>  <i>Please note that the application should be mailed only to the mailbox, and</i> <i><br></i>  <i>express mail and courier delivery to the address of the Moscow office.</i> <i><br></i>  <i>Applications without notarization of signature signed by mail or courier delivery are not considered.</i> <i><br></i>  <i>Applications from minors are accepted only in the presence of parents or with the provision of their notarized written consent to use the System.</i> <i><br><br></i>  <i>Thank you for your request.</i> <br><br><h4>  Findings? </h4><br>  And the conclusions, dear habrasoobschestvo, do it yourself.  I think we will just stop accepting Yandex.Money and we will stop the procedure for concluding an agreement on connection to a centralized control center with nuclear weapons. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/79332/">https://habr.com/ru/post/79332/</a></p>
