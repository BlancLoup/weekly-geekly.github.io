There is reason to believe that this year we will experience a rapid increase in the population of augmented reality programs.  In the latest version of iOS, Apple has built in support for mechanisms that allow programs to supplement with any information any objects that are in the field of view of the camera of a smartphone.  This not only greatly facilitates the work of programmers, but also makes AR technologies available to hundreds of thousands of iOS developers.  In the meantime, the projected abundance is not pouring on us, we decided to make a selection of interesting AR-applications. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h2>  Magicplan </h2><br>  This program can make life much easier if you are going to do repairs or redevelopment on your own.  In fact, this is a simple editor in which you can create floor plans with some basic measurements.  You can paint walls and floors in the old-fashioned way, manually, or you can turn on augmented reality mode and ‚Äúpoke‚Äù into the corners of the room.  As a result, you can get a room layout with quite good measurement accuracy.  And the ready-made plan can always be immediately corrected by hand immediately, if the automation somewhere was stupid. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/6k-SrZW3CLo" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br>  <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details%3Fid%3Dcom.sensopia.magicplan%26hl%3Den">Android</a> |  <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/magicplan/id427424432">iOS</a>

    <h2>  Inkhunter </h2><br>  Want to fill the tatoo, but doubt whether it will go to you?  If you don‚Äôt want <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3DLumLelfPIjU">Mickey Mouse</a> stuffed on the shoulder <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3DLumLelfPIjU">and the phrase ‚ÄúThank you for Alupka,‚Äù</a> it‚Äôs best to try it on seven times.  For example, with the help of InkHunter - here you can choose a picture from the extensive database for each soul and ‚Äúimpose‚Äù it on yourself.  To do this, draw a pen or a felt-tip pen at the desired place, three lines - ‚Äúsquare smile‚Äù - and point the camera at them, and right there the selected tattoo will appear on you, you can rotate it like that.  Here you can take a photo, then to choose the most suitable option. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/p_Q7eA-C6X0" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br>  <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details%3Fid%3Dtattoo.inkhunter">Android</a> |  <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/app/id991558368">iOS</a> <br><br><h2>  Star Walk 2 </h2><br>  Sometimes, you go by train or minibus home, and above you is a heavy, overcast sky.  And so I want to look at the stars, and not at these clouds and clouds of either smoke or steam from the pipes of the nearest CHP.  Or you go out for a walk in the evening with a child, and you want to show him Cassiopeia, the Big Dipper and the Polar Star, but only the Moon makes its way through the overcast light cap from the millions of lanterns and headlights of the big city.  Or luck has smiled on you, you look at the sky covered with stars, but you have no idea where the constellations are?  If the weather, the charms of urbanism, or the astronomy lessons that were skipped, do not let you enjoy the picture of the bottomless space, you can use the AR-application and dream a little.  Star Chart determines your current location and exact time, on the basis of this data loads a virtual map of the constellations and superimposes it on the image from the camera. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/14b8LyoHq74" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br>  <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details%3Fid%3Dcom.vitotechnology.StarWalk2Free">Android</a> |  <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/star-walk-2-night-sky-map/id892279069%3Fmt%3D8">iOS</a> <br><br><h2>  Ar dragon </h2><br>  This application is for children that dad and mom do not allow to have a little animal.  In essence, AR Dragon is the development of the Tamagotchi idea at a new technological level.  First of all, they give you an egg from which the dragon hatch.  Show the camera a place on the floor, where to summon the dragon, and that's it - now you are the proud owner of a fabulous big-eyed creature.  You need to feed him, you need to play with him, you need to train him.  If all this is not done, the dragon will die zahandrit and forever fly away.  Oh yeah, all the actions - throwing a fairy-tale creature an apple, or leaving a ball with it - are magical crystals.  If you fulfill the daily rate of feeding and entertainment, the crystals that need to be collected will be scattered around the dragon as a reward.  Otherwise, in the end, the little beast will have nothing to feed and ‚Äúdance‚Äù. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/AnC-3LWmA8E" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br>  <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/ar-dragon/id1270046606%3Fmt%3D8">iOS</a> <br><br>  Unfortunately, we could not find an analogue for Android. <br><br><h2>  Stack ar </h2><br>  Knowledge workers are well aware of the desire to do something very stupid, or at least just plain, to unload their brains from some task, over which they have been racking their brains for the second day or month already.  There are a lot of options for ‚Äúunloading‚Äù, each of us has our favorites.  You can safely put in a box of good solutions and augmented reality.  In Stack AR you just need to build a tower of tiles on any suitable surface. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/VyWJ9cw4mn8" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br>  <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details%3Fid%3Dcom.evogames.stackitar">Android</a> |  <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/stack-ar/id1269638287%3Fmt%3D8">iOS</a> <br><br><h2>  Quiver </h2><br>  A new word in the coloring industry.  From Quiver, you can print out sketches of colorings, then manually, paint them in an old-school manner as prompted by taste (or lack thereof), and point the smartphone camera at the masterpiece.  And then - the magic of augmented reality.  Children, and you too, will be delighted. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/edi4qX1oviI" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/tmfXgvT9h3s" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/tBYm53L79YY" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br>  <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details%3Fid%3Dcom.puteko.colarmix">Android</a> |  <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/ru/app/quiver-3d-coloring-app/id650645305%3Fmt%3D8">iOS</a> <br><br><h2>  Car finder ar </h2><br>  Useful program for car owners.  It happens, you put the car in the parking lot near the hypermarket on the weekend, then you leave after a few hours of insane shopping and walking your wife with children, you look at hundreds of cars and try hard to remember, and where the hell is your iron horse?  Car Finder AR will save you from running around in the parking lot.  When you unload the car, do not forget to press the ‚ÄúI parked here‚Äù button while standing next to it.  The program will remember the location, and then you can easily find the car, following the arrow superimposed on the image from the camera.  But since the program needs GPS, it will not work in covered parking lots. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/1p/zu/wa/1pzuwawxv3zehh0kbtvwz3ljcry.jpeg"><br><br>  <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details%3Fid%3Dnet.androoid.carxare%26hl%3Den">Android</a> |  <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/es/app/find-your-car-ar-augmented/id370836023%3Fl%3Den%26mt%3D8">iOS</a> <br><br><h2>  ZG: Revenant </h2><br>  In this game, several good ingredients are mixed: our boyish love of soldiers, love of everything that shoots, especially in bursts and loudly banging, as well as racial hostility towards zombies.  Place your small outpost on a comfortable place on the carpet or on the table and take the seat of a helicopter pilot.  Your task is to destroy as many waves of zombies as possible before your outpost is demolished.  He will be torn down anyway, because the zombies will grow stronger, they will be snapped more and more from different directions.  After each battle you will be given money, spare parts for upgrade, new weapons.  We hang machine guns, cannons, rockets, increase their damage, put on a helmet with a thermal imager, and again start an interspecific battle.  And persistent advice: do not go far from the outlet.  The game eats electricity, like a hippopotamus brooms. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/osyD6RiPkzI" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br>  <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/zombie-gunship-revenant-ar/id1254976492%3Fmt%3D8">iOS</a> <br><br>  There are no Android versions yet, but there is a similar game by the same <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details%3Fid%3Dcom.limbic.ac130">Zombie Gunship</a> company: you need to play as an AC-130 Gunship gunner, and this is not an augmented reality. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/374397/">https://habr.com/ru/post/374397/</a></p>
