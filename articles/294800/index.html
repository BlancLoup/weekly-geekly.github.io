  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Do not fall for fake letters</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Recently, we lowered tariffs, and expanded the functionality of our service, it became available for any online store (the cost of a callback is only 4 rubles) and covers most of the needs of our customers.  In addition, we are constantly working on quality, and if there is not enough functionality, we refine it on the individual requests of customers. <br>  In the end, look under the cut as competitors are trying to survive and advertise at our expense, deceiving webmasters and owners of online stores. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/24e/0b1/0b7/24e0b10b75e64d97abe21df2fca3c1e7.png" alt="image"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  More recently, a callback cost 17 rubles per minute, but we switched to a new scheme: <h2>  conversation costs 4 rubles </h2>  (and not 10, 20, 100 rubles per call or lead) and we are working to improve the functionality of the system and charge him a monthly fee, while customers who are not yet ready to pay for the add.  functionality can use the free version. <br>  Like the free and the paid version, a huge number of possibilities. <br><br>  In addition, when addressing large customers, on individual requests, we implement their Wishlist in the form of missing functions with high priority. <br>  For example, recently a client approached us, selling tractors throughout Russia and the CIS.  They have only one manager who did not have time to pick up the phone.  We implemented the opportunity to increase the time in the timer.  Now customers do not complain. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/d89/727/b5a/d89727b5a09543719cd035c23b90130f.png" alt="image"><br>  The official representative of a large company selling cars in Russia, it was necessary to add a logo, and we realized this opportunity. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/ea6/483/3f7/ea64833f7c454f389bed724f5fabed59.png" alt="image">

      There are many more examples, every day there is a new functionality. <br>  Also, our administrators constantly monitor the quality of communication, because for us it is important to provide our customers with the best service. <br>  It is unacceptable for us to lose calls to our customers due to poor communication quality or technical problems. <br><br>  The mechanisms for capturing customers are constantly improving, because it is on them that the conversion of visitors into buyers depends. <br><br>  As a customer-oriented company, we attach great importance to the quality of service and customer satisfaction.  Only in the contact center we have 15 operators who are ready to answer any client's question, help him figure out the settings or solve another problem. <br><br>  At the same time, ‚Äúcollective companies‚Äù that cannot compete in quality, try to get customers by any other means, using ‚Äúwild‚Äù marketing and not hesitating to deceive their potential customers. <br><br>  Today an informational mailing was held that pozvonim.com service is closing, come to us, we have favorable tariffs.  This is certainly not the case, <b><a href="http://pozvonim.com/">pozvonim.com is</a> actively developing, our team is working daily on the service, not sparing the strength and resources.</b> <br>  Here's what it looked like: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/065/410/788/065410788ae54ddc852382572e76465e.JPG" alt="image"><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/a4f/074/b98/a4f074b98e89413983a87a53c2ed70b1.JPG" alt="image"><br><br>  The ‚Äúsmart‚Äù author of this newsletter, who tried to deceive to attract clients to himself, probably attracted attention to himself, but while working with online stores, their trust was not exactly obtained. <br><br>  We still had hope that the company indicated in the letter was not in the know, and someone from the partners made a similar marketing move, therefore our commercial director contacted the manager of this service, then the owner. <br>  The manager asked what this mailing is bad for and can they remove the referral link by replacing it with a direct link? <br><br>  Then we asked the owner of the service lptracker to block the advertising link.  The link was blocked for 5 minutes, after which they turned it on again.  The telephone number of our Commercial Director was added to the black list, so it was not possible to communicate again. <br>  And for some reason, a rocket appeared on their logo, probably in order to form the correct associations of the user :) <br>  So, we draw conclusions ... <br><br>  <b>Trust is the basis for building business relationships.</b>  Dear customers, business owners, do not work with those who from the first minute of their acquaintance mislead you.  You can not build a strong relationship on deception, such partners will let you down at the most unexpected moment for you. <br><br>  Be careful, do not mess with scammers! </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/294800/">https://habr.com/ru/post/294800/</a></p>
