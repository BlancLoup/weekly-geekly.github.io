Each police video camera that records video in the subway will be equipped with such a sensor;  accordingly, the entire system as a whole will be able to track the movements of a certain <nobr>SIM card</nobr> in the subway and supply this route with recorded video clips of passenger movements ( <nobr>SIM card</nobr> carrier <nobr>).</nobr>

      Four circumstances are not without interest, which publish Izvestia from the words of the head of the operations department of the Internal Affairs Directorate at the Moscow Metro - Andrei Mokhov - and which I will list under the name of the official. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a>  <b>First, the</b> range of the sensor is about five meters.  Not bad for the detection system of <nobr>the SIM card,</nobr> which is usually hidden in the metal parts of the cell phone. <br><br>  <b>Secondly, the</b> ability of the sensor to operate regardless of whether the phone is turned on or not.  Visitors to the Moscow metro fit to start worrying about what kind of power the sensor should be for this, is it time to go to the metro in a lead apron for security, is it not for nothing that masons don an apron - perhaps the masons <nobr>know something.</nobr> <br><br>  <b>Thirdly,</b> exactly how the constitutional ban on spying on people was circumvented.  (‚ÄúBy law, we are forbidden to monitor a person without appropriate <nobr>sanctions,‚Äù</nobr> <nobr>Mokhov</nobr> said <nobr>. ‚Äú</nobr> But you can monitor the assets of companies that are <nobr>SIM cards.‚Äù)</nobr> <br><br>  <b>Fourth, the</b> purpose of the system: search for stolen mobile phones. <br><br>  At this place you can begin to laugh loudly with precisely that bitter laugh, which is the best evidence of the loss of the former naive belief in the good aspirations of the state.  After all, the secret list of banned sites, sadly familiar to all of us, was also once supposedly supposed to combat the spread of drug addiction, suicides and child pornography - but only until the field of drug addicts, suicides and even pedophilic works through a number of subordinate and departmental orders turned out expanded to an extreme degree and did not start to include an indefinite circle of works of modern culture and previous generations.  Every reader and viewer, not to mention a publisher, can at any time with genuine surprise and horror find that the state treats its civil rights on the Internet exactly as if it were a stunned suicidal pedophile - and not even worse . <br><br>  Therefore, it is not difficult to suspect this: much, much sooner than we all think, every cellular customer will be seen as a potential pickpocket, and faceless video recordings in metropolitan archives will magically turn into equipped with an indication of a mobile number, passport number, place of registration, place of work monthly income, a list of chronic diseases, a list of bad habits, a list of family members, a list of online accounts, a list of visited sites, a list of political and religious beliefs - and  ak further - <b>to every passer-by,</b> carrying his sim card in your pocket. <br><br>  And then this information will be lit up in Google‚Äôs eyes by the police - of course, only to give them more means to prevent crime - and will inevitably be available for indexing in Google. <br><br>  And finally, the day will come when this underground chthonic practice will climb out of the subway. <br><br>  Who can stop her? <br><br>  Who is like this beast?  and who can fight him?  <nobr>(Rev. 13: 4.)</nobr> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/188236/">https://habr.com/ru/post/188236/</a></p>
