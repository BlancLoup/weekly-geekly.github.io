Why?  Because technologies that were previously specific to certain sectors will become mainstream.  So let's see what new jobs will arise because of this, and where can they exist? <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  <b>1. Virtual Reality (VR) Developer - Virtual Reality Developer</b> <br><br>  Until recently, VR was a technology that was associated exclusively with games.  And now we are starting to consider using VR for other commercial and social purposes. <br>  Construction companies are now hiring virtual reality developers to give their customers the opportunity to walk around the building before it is built, and universities consider using virtual reality to create virtual classrooms.  With this boom in the use of technology in our daily life, there is an increase in the number of vacancies for VR developers.  However, it must be admitted that at the moment it is more typical for the American or Asian labor markets, in Russia such specialists are not yet in great demand.

      <b>2. Artificial Intelligence (AI) Developer - Developer of Artificial Intelligence</b> <br><br>  AI is about to become a new UI interface.  With the advent of virtual helpers in the home, such as Alexa, Siri, and Google Assistant, we are starting to interact with technology in a completely new way.  Will this be the beginning of the end of the screens?  Probably not right away.  However, this will make the technology much more accessible to the next generation and will offer another way to attract already existing users. <br><br>  <b>3. Internet of Things Developer - Developer of the Internet of Things</b> <br><br>  Due to the fact that the smart home is becoming a reality, and the smart city is firmly strengthening its position within government programs, there is a significant opportunity to create new applications for this rapidly and rapidly growing market. <br><br>  <b>4. Internet of Things Engineer - Internet of Things Engineer</b> <br><br>  We will not only need to create applications, but also need to develop hardware that will be the platform for the Internet of things.  They will range from smart cars to smart street lights, smart bins and smart refrigerators, and on to the whole world. <br><br>  <b>5. Data Scientist</b> <br><br>  With the boom of the Internet of Things and the fact that sensors are becoming part of everyday life, we will create data even faster.  However, the data without their understanding have no value, so you can safely expect a great demand for professionals in the field of Data Science and Advanced Analytics. <br><br>  <b>6. Data Analyst - Data Analyst</b> <br><br>  Although there is already a high demand for these skills, it will grow at an incredible pace, as long as technologies such as Artificial Intelligence assistants do not understand every word of each user, this data must be tagged and processed to facilitate effective machine learning. as a result, the need for data analytics will only increase. <br><br>  <b>7. Cyber ‚Äã‚ÄãSecurity Engineer - Cyber ‚Äã‚ÄãSecurity Engineer</b> <br><br>  Data is everywhere, and with this there is a risk of hacking.  For example, medical technologies worn on the body provide tremendous opportunities in preventive health care.  However, can you imagine the consequences of hacking data with a person‚Äôs personal health information? <br>  Since the abduction of personal data of people is particularly painful (especially if we take into account legislation in the form of the General Data Protection Regulation in the EU), organizations invest heavily in ensuring the security of this data to avoid reputational and financial consequences. <br><br>  <b>8. Augmented Reality (AR) Developer - Augmented Reality Developer</b> <br><br>  2016 was a breakthrough year in augmented reality games after the launch and success of Pokemon.  Nevertheless, Google glasses did not win the attention of the public, and how much virtual reality could outrun AR as a preferred platform - only time will tell! </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/339262/">https://habr.com/ru/post/339262/</a></p>
