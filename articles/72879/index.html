Yes, there were several options, but they did not satisfy us on different parameters - in one it‚Äôs difficult to add items (you need to spend half a dozen tapas on this), in the other, the interface is clumsy, etc.  In short, it was decided to develop an application in this niche, convenient and beautiful at the same time. <br><br><h4>  Implementation </h4><br>  I will give a few pictures of the application itself, so that it becomes clear what I mean: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/0aa/d13/c25/0aad13c2521c48b9c43456ec90d82b07.jpg" alt="image"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/6b1/9f3/5ad/6b19f35addcbfa35e9d84ea057a03e4c.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/51e/a00/2ed/51ea002edb0d149579b7e917609db3e8.jpg" alt="image"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/04b/540/e01/04b540e0102d1faecdd09837e1b87aa6.jpg" alt="image">

    <h4>  Version 1.0 </h4><br>  Immediately created two versions of the application - paid and free, with advertising banners.  At the first stage, the functionality of both versions was absolutely the same, and apart from advertising, they were no different.  Yes, and they were established at the same time - with a difference of one day, as they were sent to Apple. <br><br><h4>  Version 1.1 </h4><br>  But with the new version a lot of features and beauty were added to the paid version of the application, and then the fun began.  The update of the two versions was sent with a difference a day, but after 20 (!) Days a refusal came from there - Apple didn‚Äôt want to launch our application just because in the recently appeared keywords (keywords for searching apps in itunes) we indicated the word ‚ÄúDisney‚Äù which in our opinion was related to the application, since  people could get together with uPackinglist and on vacation, and on a business trip, and in disney-land, but Apple censors thought otherwise - that this <b>keyword refers to other applications, but not to ours</b> .  I had to re-upload these updates right away, removing only one word in keywords ... And after 11 days, the free version was approved and made available to users! <br><br>  But the adventures of the paid version continued.  After another 26 (!!!) days, Apple employees saw that the iPhone was drawn on one of the new background images, and this turned out to be <b>a copyright violation of Apple‚Äôs trademark</b> ... I had to change these pictures. <br><br><h4>  Version 1.2 </h4><br>  By this time, some additional new functionality appeared for the paid version, and for both versions - a new interface language (Russian, English, German and Italian are now supported).  Therefore, both versions have already been sent for the next approval. <br><br>  Fortunately, now it took the apple censors not so much time - in less than 2 weeks both updated versions became available.  Today, the difference is that in the paid for each item in the list, you can add a quantity and a comment, change the icon for any category, and also change the background images of the entire application (for a choice of three themes). <br><br><h4>  We try to tooth </h4><br><br>  Now any of you can for free: <br> <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewSoftware%3Fid%3D323363997%26mt%3D8"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/aed/918/c7a/aed918c7a51ed7a36b377b0a2b869601.png" alt="image"></a> <br><br>  Or buy the full version for only $ 1.99: <br> <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewSoftware%3Fid%3D323241118%26mt%3D8"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/353/41f/07c/35341f07c0a187ac682ebe19fe8e36d7.png" alt="image"></a> <br><br>  Of course, we actively support this product as well, and next updates will be released soon. <br><br>  If you have any wishes and suggestions, we will be happy to consider them;) <br>  All successful trips! </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/72879/">https://habr.com/ru/post/72879/</a></p>
