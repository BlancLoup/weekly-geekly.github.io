And I felt that it would be so, but decided to follow this path.  For what?  For the sake of experience?  No, that you.  As they say, only two things are endless - the Universe and human stupidity, although I‚Äôm not sure about the Universe.  Here, most likely I wanted to check how much you can trust your intuition.  And she did not let me down, but that's so silly ... <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  It all started with the fact that before the New Year, we in our modest company, as always, made successful sales of dedicated servers - black Fridays, cyber monday, New Year and New Year discounts.  And we offer dedicated servers for rent in the data centers of our partners in the Netherlands and the USA for 6 years, after we completely left Ukraine <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/company/ua-hosting/blog/180851/">due to a variety of factors</a> , and we will soon be deployed in England.  So speculative traders - we will earn you!  After all, we do not have a whole "vysera" (and this is a technical term) of outdated and not very configurations <a href="https://ua-hosting.company/serversnl">on the website</a> , as is fashionable with some hosting providers, who, instead of offering cost-effective, "float" to people, horrible, without thinking and not knowing why.  And if data centers can be understood - there is a big ‚Äúzoo‚Äù of outdated iron for precisely these reasons and it needs to be put somewhere.  Some of the providers ... <br><br>  In short, we are not like that.  We offer essentially a single platform, really magical, and at a price two times lower than for the same and with the same quality from others, due to the fact that our entire turnover is one and the same, that our margin is minimal, which is a huge plus for customers, and for whom it is expensive - that goes to ....  In VPS, and not simple, but with <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/company/ua-hosting/blog/347386/">dedicated drives</a> , outdated and not very entry-level dedicated servers surpass the performance.

      During this period, we had a lot of large orders, sometimes administrators advise us to their customers and get their% for it, making customers more expensive than purchasing from us.  I am always wary of large orders, as in the case when a large customer leaves, a huge simple one is formed immediately, which is almost impossible to recycle in less than a month, and in some cases the situation can be even worse.  That is why, if I can easily give a 15% discount to an order in several servers, then an order from 30 fairly expensive servers will give a lower discount and be no more than 10%, except in cases of long-term contractual obligations, or even not at all with a monthly payment option. <br><br>  As a result, immediately after Black Friday, we received an order for 30 servers of our basic configuration from one of the administrators for his client, and the location was not important to him, but we decided to provide infrastructure in the Netherlands, since we have the maximum demand in this location : <br><br>  Dell R730xd 2 x Intel Dodeca-Core Xeon E5-2650 v4 128GB DDR4 6x480GB SSD 1Gbps 100 TV - priced at (349-10%) * 30) = $ 9,423 per month for 30 cars worth over 200 thousand euros, excluding costs on accommodation, connectivity and support. <br><br>  I had previously met with miners who ordered iron from us, I am not at all a fan of this business and even an adversary, since nothing good can be expected from them and they do not produce anything, while consuming quite real resources in vain.  That is, they do work only for the sake of money, which is low, plus they stimulate the rest.  It has long been proven - 95% of people can not create anything of value in principle.  Best of all, this thesis was confirmed by the Internet itself, namely its web 2.0 reincarnation.  Those people who have created high-quality content before, continue to create it.  Everything else is filled with outright trash.  Today, every second person has expressed himself, but this in itself is not a problem.  It is generally even useful if no one sees.  The problem is that all this is done not for oneself or for friends, but falls out in the form of a real under-product on the market, which turned out to be mining in principle.  And here I had such a suspicion that the miner could order the infrastructure, especially in view of the growth of the cryptocurrency market at that time. <br><br>  Nevertheless, we still need to make a turn in order to provide good prices for the rest of our customers and we cannot refuse to service our customers only on the basis of our suspicions, plus, as a rule, we are able to recycle that number of cars in a month, because without much hesitation, I agreed to provide this infrastructure to the admin client.  The administrator generally found himself in huge advantages, since he earned at least $ 50 on each of our servers, without taking any risks and financial obligations.  Good to be admin :) <br><br>  The end of December is coming, the cryptocurrency courses are falling rapidly, and with them the interest in mining, especially since, from experience, few people have been successful on the servers.  And then there's the New Year holidays.  It is not surprising that the client of our administrator has notified that he has nothing to pay.  What all did not come as a surprise to us.  But the rejection of the servers of another one of the big clients of the same admin was a surprise.  Obviously also, mining was not a success ... Fortunately, it was just a few US servers that did not bring us big losses, but the conclusion about the reliability of customers was made.  10% discount is clearly a lot for such orders, for such orders you need to give a premium.  Since the risk of failure is very high, and then no margin will override the loss of idle 30+ servers, if idle for more than a month. <br><br>  I never believed in contextual advertising, in terms of successful sales of dedicated servers, it just does not pay off, even for a year, even for two.  Well, this knowledge will not bring any.  That is why our advertising - the knowledge and experience, the construction of new solutions, in which we invest free working capital.  And significant.  It is better to distribute resources to developers for free and provide yourself with an additional rating than to invest in the context.  It will be more effective. <br><br>  Back in 2010, I had the experience of using such advertising, though from Yandex.  Then there was the huge problem of ad clicks, though it is worth noting that Yandex returned the money.  And advertising from Yandex, in some form, but it worked.  But not in the one in which I wanted, of course, at that time.  True setup was pretty simple and straightforward. <br><br>  After I tried to watch Google Adwords from time to time, and even spent a small advertising campaign.  And here, at the time of the release of 30 servers, I receive a letter: <br><blockquote>  Mi have missed you.  Advert a bonus on advertising in rozm—ñr—ñ 900 UAH.  —ñ znovu pochn—ñ pritatti kl—ñ—înt—ñv. </blockquote>  Well, I think, okay, idle for $ 9k per month, electricity is wasted, servers are wasted, and almost the end of January.  Let's try advertising, maybe we will sell a couple, and maybe more, the servers are good, our problem is that they know little about us.  Well, I replenished the account, at the beginning, for a total amount of UAH 50,000 (almost $ 2,000). <br><br>  Do you think I got a 900 UAH bonus on advertising?  But what about?  Not.  Since I honestly indicated the address of the registration of our company - Belize, the system gladly informed me that this offer is available only for Ukraine, but did not open a new payment profile with Ukraine via our e-mail address.  This is how Google ‚Äúthrew‚Äù me for the first time.  No, of course all honest, I just did not read a minor postscript about how their bonus works and when. <br><br>  Further it was even more interesting.  I honestly, like when working with Yandex, picked up keywords and made a normal type of ad with honestly specified information, without any search nonsense.  It turned out that in order to achieve a result later, the ads need not one, but a whole group.  I spent a lot of time on this, with Google tricky filters, and the logic of their system was quite difficult to understand, although perhaps their system was too clever for me.  In Yandex, as far as I remember, everything was much simpler, and the result could be better.  In any case, it seemed so to me at that time ... But I already replenished the account by almost $ 2,000, and all the more, I needed an audience from Ukraine as well (40% of our users from this country), so I had to choose the Google option. <br><br>  There are several types of matching in the Google Adwords contextual advertising system that you can assign to keywords.  Accurate, broad or phrasal.  Depending on the type chosen, the audience coverage may narrow or expand.  I experimented with all three.  Broad or phrasal were swept away immediately.  Since we were visited on the website by visitors who entered the following type of requests: <br><blockquote>  one <br>  100.00% <br>  17.83 UAH <br>  17.83 UAH <br>  vega craft <br>  Broad match <br>  Not <br>  Ad Group 1 <br><br>  one <br>  100.00% <br>  15.69 UAH <br>  15.69 UAH <br>  top 100 mu online <br>  Broad match <br>  Not <br>  Ad Group 1 <br><br>  one <br>  100.00% <br>  19.48 UAH <br>  19.48 UAH <br>  thor ragnarok online <br>  Broad match <br>  Not <br>  Ad Group 1 <br><br>  2 <br>  50.00% <br>  11.99 UAH <br>  11.99 UAH <br>  testtankionline <br>  Broad match <br>  Not <br>  Ad Group 1 <br><br>  one <br>  100.00% <br>  20.84 UAH <br>  20.84 UAH <br>  test tankionline com <br>  Broad match <br>  Not <br>  Ad Group 1 <br><br>  one <br>  100.00% <br>  18.55 UAH <br>  18.55 UAH <br>  test tankionline <br>  Broad match <br>  Not <br>  Ad Group 1 <br><br>  one <br>  100.00% <br>  25.12 UAH <br>  25.12 UAH <br>  sxland ru <br>  Broad match <br>  Not <br>  Ad Group 1 <br><br>  one <br>  100.00% <br>  2.51 UAH <br>  2.51 UAH <br>  streamcraft <br>  Broad match <br><br>  2 <br>  50.00% <br>  19.48 UAH <br>  19.48 UAH <br>  questc en 25565 version 1.8 1.11 <br>  Broad match <br>  Not <br>  Ad Group 1 <br><br>  one <br>  100.00% <br>  17.70 UAH <br>  17.70 UAH <br>  onlinegreen mcdonate ru <br>  Broad match <br>  Not <br>  Ad Group 1 <br><br>  one <br>  100.00% <br>  24.66 UAH <br>  24.66 UAH <br>  myarena ru <br>  Broad match <br>  Not <br>  Ad Group 1 <br><br>  one <br>  100.00% <br>  28.74 UAH <br>  28.74 UAH <br>  mu online 6 season <br>  Broad match <br>  Not <br>  Ad Group 1 <br><br>  one <br>  100.00% <br>  28.35 UAH <br>  28.35 UAH <br>  mc chorusmine ru <br>  Broad match <br>  Not <br>  Ad Group 1 <br><br>  one <br>  100.00% <br>  27.97 UAH <br>  27.97 UAH <br>  lineage c4 <br>  Broad match <br>  Not <br>  Ad Group 1 <br><br>  one <br>  100.00% <br>  13.70 UAH <br>  13.70 UAH <br>  l2 x100 <br>  Broad match <br>  Not <br>  Ad Group 1 <br><br>  one <br>  100.00% <br>  17.13 UAH <br>  17.13 UAH <br>  l2 top <br>  Broad match <br>  Not <br>  Ad Group 1 <br><br>  one <br>  100.00% <br>  29.25 UAH <br>  29.25 UAH <br>  kodi tanki online <br>  Broad match <br>  Not <br>  Ad Group 1 <br><br>  one <br>  100.00% <br>  11.99 UAH <br>  11.99 UAH <br>  ip hivemc <br>  Broad match <br>  Not <br>  Ad Group 1 <br><br>  one <br>  100.00% <br>  24.71 UAH <br>  24.71 UAH <br>  gomcpe ru 33333 <br>  Broad match <br>  Not <br>  Ad Group 1 <br><br>  2 <br>  50.00% <br>  2,86 UAH. <br>  2,86 UAH. <br>  gamenix su <br>  Broad match <br>  Not <br>  Ad Group 1 <br><br>  one <br>  100.00% <br>  14.56 UAH <br>  14.56 UAH <br>  funtime su <br>  Broad match <br>  Not <br>  Ad Group 1 <br><br>  one <br>  100.00% <br>  22.66 UAH <br>  22.66 UAH <br>  foxdaycraft <br>  Broad match <br>  Not <br>  Ad Group 1 <br><br>  one <br>  100.00% <br>  10.31 UAH <br>  10.31 UAH <br>  fhx s2 <br>  Broad match <br>  Not <br>  Ad Group 1 <br></blockquote>  And there were hundreds of such requests, our keywords (servers, virtual servers, etc.) were not contained at all, and how ‚ÄúBroad match‚Äù or ‚ÄúPhrase‚Äù was applicable in these cases, I don‚Äôt know ... I used both types, but not yet done ‚ÄúExact‚Äù was such a garbage, which was made by the youngsters looking for games for $ 1.  But what was my surprise when similar requests began to arrive even by the ‚ÄúExact‚Äù type, and I had more than a hundred requests with the names of games and not only added to the exceptions: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/de/ni/id/deniidu81_ifduld-tgtvhp838s.jpeg"><br><br>  Moreover, when I chose "Broad Match" for the excluded game.  She continued to appear in my clicks in all other different variations?  Google, how so?  Yes, I agree that the broad type of correspondence works on the principle Minecraft approaches the server, since it is the server of Minecraft, however, why does it only work in favor of Google?  When an advertiser asks to exclude everything related to Minecraft, he has to enter many variations of ‚ÄúBroad Match‚Äù, instead of typing one word of the game and that's it. <br><br>  That is, I was finished off by the fact that even by ‚ÄúExact Match‚Äù, Google continued to send non-target clicks to me.  After killing a lot of time on setting up filters, I still achieved a reduction in the ‚Äújunk‚Äù traffic, however, the coverage of the audience I needed fell.  Clicks was extremely small. <br><br>  It turned out that Google is assessing the quality of the ad, and if the ad in the campaign as a result of your or not your mistakes, gets a low quality score, the ad needs to be re-created and re-configured!  But I learned about this later. <br><br>  In the meantime, I just used the advertising budget, because I just realized that Google ads would not bring anything good to me.  We received inadequate chat, especially from mobile traffic, which cannot be turned off with simple settings, but it turned out to be turned off only by making the price per click less by an order of magnitude than per click from conventional devices.  Again, the feature of their stupidly abstruse platform! <br><br>  I threw out 50 000 UAH and was no longer going to set experiments on myself, nor on my own time.  The budget is over.  For a week somewhere.  I apparently didn‚Äôt get any benefit from this and once again made sure that all these advertisements are a way to fuck you for money, but in no way give an opportunity to get a good result.  For a good way to check is the only one - offer Google to get a part of the profit from the clients attracted by them, and he certainly will not agree to work under such conditions. <br><br>  Although I met mega brains on freelance, which offered to work according to such a scheme, maybe it works in other topics, and perhaps it is a way to attract customers. <br><br>  And so, literally the next day after the end of the budget, all of a sudden, no one calls me ... Google.  And pretends that, as it were, ‚Äúwe accidentally noticed here that you started advertising with us and would like to offer you help with more effective setting up of the advertising campaign by our specialists‚Äù.  Of course by chance!  After all, so often come to them customers who can throw 50 000 UAH (10-15 average wages. Fees of Ukraine) per week.  No, to call on the same day, to help before the person launches the advertising budget to nowhere ... They have so many customers there!  Incredibly much ... But that is not the question.  It was already clear that I don‚Äôt intend to pay more to these good people, as they are not just ineffective, they are 10 times worse than Yandex, because they made the settings so abstruse that even their specialists cannot cope with them!  But more about that later. <br><br>  I describe the situation brightly and colorfully on the phone and talk in general about what I think about their programmers and what kind of ‚Äúhell do I want them to burn‚Äù (if someone works at Google, don‚Äôt seek it, it's all figuratively and in fact I'm not offended , but just emotionally describing the work of their system), after such a magical work of their system.  And how can it even be that Google works so lame in terms of context, and this is a technical term that Yandex, which seems to be not in the first place, turns out to be better in context.  In any case, there for your money at least you yourself do not force the brain so with the settings of the advertising system.  They could offer the manager immediately if they needed help.  Maybe they could, but then they contacted me only after a waste of 10 hours.  boards <br><br>  Agreed that I will describe the problem in the mail.  Described, indicating all the work with their system.  And he added a little about further cooperation: <br><blockquote>  Please look at all the statistics and would like to, if honestly, Google compensated for such clicks. <br><br>  Plus, with the promotional code "kick" unpleasant turned out, for 900 UAH the one that was sent to us.  We have a jur.  face in Belize, it turns out, we could not use that promo code. <br><br>  But we are not getting poorer by UAH 900, but the fact that they clicked on such nonsense at 15k hryvnia is a pity. <br><br>  I am ready to replenish the account with UAH 100k and in the future to replenish it in the future if these clicks are compensated and the company is set up in such a way that we will not receive garbage clicks. </blockquote>  It's funny that immediately after this letter I received another promo code, which for obvious reasons I also could not use.  Correcting the problem by contacting our own support, or asking the management for a code valid for Belize, AdWords Online Strategist was not able to.  But not the point. <br><br>  They called me and told me that they were ready to provide me with my own specialist who would set up everything and support me during the first three months.  When asked if it would be possible to pay for the services of your person later, if he manages, but so that he continues our support, I was told: ‚Äúunfortunately not, Google does not provide this service on a fee basis, and this option is available for every advertising campaign and account only 1 time. "  Then it was proposed to use the same settings for the subsequent advertising and it should all seem to work.  Apparently, it is possible to understand them a little, but the desire to lure new ‚Äúcash cows‚Äù is great.  It is much more profitable to set up everything for it to work, and show for 3 months how cool it is, and then receive money every month, firmly convincing the client that it was Google Adwords that brought him success.  It is worth saying that after I decided to stop working with them, the support guys went to the meeting and promised to think of something if I decide to continue the cooperation. <br><br>  Again, I do not extend this rule to all subjects, but I have already seen how advertising works in the hosting industry.  No wonder my colleague, the owner of another hosting provider, wrote that one mailing to the current customer base brought him more orders than with Google Adwords, at an expense of $ 300 per month. <br><br>  We decided to try with the budget "without restrictions", and I was ready to replenish hryvnia with 100k all the time, if there was at least some visible result from these 100k.  The result is a payback of not more than 1.5 years, since the higher it will exceed the life expectancy of the average customer, which can be quite dangerous.  And there is a chance to go into a weak minus.  Although sometimes only 1 client can cost hundreds of others.  As it will recommend you to someone who will order a large infrastructure.  Therefore, regardless of whether you use paid advertising or not, remember that the best advertising is your high-quality work and feedback from very satisfied customers, then the margin on the spent advertising budget will be higher.  Do not try to advertise a bad or low-quality product.  Only a very good product is worthy of advertising.  That is what we counted on, agreeing with such a huge return on investment without any 100% guarantee. <br><br>  Of course, Google said that it can‚Äôt return anything, since there were clicks, and for clicking it‚Äôs like how the system returns them automatically.  And offered to try to collaborate with the participation of their specialist.  There was no particular choice.  The $ 9k idle time has decreased, but not at the expense of Google, and the amount still remained substantial, plus 50,000 UAH was wasted, and what if I'm just a moron and their specialist, who knows the system fully, will be able to set everything up efficiently?  After all, they are so confidently talking about successful advertising campaigns, and on the Internet I have seen specialists working according to the% of profit scheme (for the result), maybe Google Adwords can be an additional means of our marketing, which will not only help to recycle simple, but also make Prices for current customers are lower due to an increase in the number of subscribers, even without profit growth for us? <br><br>  Here are some thoughts I had.  And I agreed. <br><br>  The next 100k tranche was conducted, and the current campaigns were suspended, until the settings and appruva by a specialist from Google: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/ci/mo/6q/cimo6qcg5rtrd7hzmhwqyqxt2ro.jpeg"><br><br>  Alexander spent hours explaining to me on the phone the peculiarities of their system, which, after some time, needed to be shown to advertise target ads again, that you also need to connect the media network, and not just the ads from the search I was targeted at, since it is ‚Äúvery expensive "That advertising should have a maximum degree of compliance with the text of advertising.  A media network can lower the cost per click, as well as the quality of ads, which also affects the price.  In general, Alexander is a very good specialist, thanks in any case to him for everything.  Sincerely trying to help.  Well, it seemed to me anyway, and I used to trust people.  Although at the same time, very often I do not believe even myself. <br><br>  He spent a day or two on the setup, and we started all this in the work.  It was decided to add even graphic banners, but oops ... another surprise, all those banners that we successfully applied everywhere, at a conference in Los Angeles, in printed materials, in banner Internet advertising, for some reason did not fit Google. <br><blockquote>  Unfortunately, the dimensions did not fit, I used the logo from the previous letter and the images from the photobank to create responsive ads. <br><br>  GDN campaign is ready, you can run. <br><br>  Under the link you can <a href="https://adwords.google.com/aw_displayads/creatives/ExternalPreview%3Fhl%3Dru%26ad%3D248793706455%26adGroup%3D51435983237%26ocid%3D248431674%26isObfuscatedOcid%3Dfalse%26showMulPreview%3Dtrue%26showVariations%3Dtrue%26creativeType%3D15%26tk%3Dnull%26isSuppressNativeSquareImage%3Dtrue%26sig%3DACiVB_zRDQbz3s2uNd_HgukKOqa8m0mhbg">see how the ad looks here</a> and <a href="https://adwords.google.com/aw_displayads/creatives/ExternalPreview%3Fhl%3Dru%26ad%3D248804535280%26adGroup%3D51435983237%26ocid%3D248431674%26isObfuscatedOcid%3Dfalse%26showMulPreview%3Dtrue%26showVariations%3Dtrue%26creativeType%3D15%26tk%3Dnull%26isSuppressNativeSquareImage%3Dtrue%26sig%3DACiVB_wlFkJTXX65IFn87aDilCylyvpU4w">here</a> . </blockquote>  It turns out that the cost of advertising also depends on the beauty of the banner, the extent of which is determined semi-automatically by Google, mostly people decide.  Because Alexander, I was extremely recommended to make banners specifically for Google, but I was interested primarily in the context, and not banners.  I did not even bother too much with the fact that he put the dollar sign on the wrong side of the value and did not indicate the type of processor E5-2650 v4, which was quite important information.  Anyway, there must have been some kind of efficiency.  This is the little things.  And let Google experts show the best result, which can be obtained for 100 000 UAH, independently.  That is, I gave complete freedom of action. <br><br>  However, inadequate chat continued to go, already with the settings of Alexander.  To which he told me that ‚Äúwe are often called to support and ask for a loan,‚Äù that is, it cannot be filtered out completely, since a person ‚Äúcould be interested in similar services, like you used to have, and it was for this reason that Google showed him an ad‚Äù . <br><br>  Nevertheless, such shots were depressing: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/h5/7k/bk/h57kbkfhf-dt_jlhrd2d0qc0sbg.jpeg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/2t/_j/xo/2t_jxokxcdjf8-3xgcftlebskzy.jpeg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/pb/sr/if/pbsrifsq8hfdt17ct8ej_ppgsbq.jpeg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/dj/h3/6s/djh36sqprvibtmakz08xcmwwcjm.jpeg"><br><br>  We decided to introduce filters for some of the countries and add an English segment.  I was sent a list of keywords for approval: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/wl/0y/j-/wl0yj-aww8enltgsq3-ra7icixs.jpeg"><br><br>  In my reply, I wrote the following: <br><blockquote>  There the prices, as if to say in a cultural language, are strange, at 3000 UAH per click (more than $ 100), it seems to me that the pricing policy is simply unwise. <br><br>  At the request, which is searched 10 times a month, to set such a price ... <br><br>  Let's just inquiries with an adequate price. <br><br>  Otherwise, I feel that the plan with 100-200 UAH for the user, which you promised at the beginning, will not succeed in everything, because the budget will end sooner than we get the users. </blockquote>  I received the following answer: <br><blockquote>  Prices per click form competitors, we, unfortunately, have no influence on this.  In this case, the level of competition also works, for example: <br><br>  If the word is 10 requests per month, and all competitors want to advertise on it, they put high rates, then the average market price per click on this word will be very high. <br><br>  At the moment, for your advertising campaign, I am trying to find the cheapest and conversion sources, in connection with this, the campaign activity is quite low, but the search queries that users follow are the most relevant. <br><br>  I send a screenshot with the data on orders, there were only microconversions on the search campaign, in connection with which I will soon change the settings for the parameters that were discussed in you by phone. <br><br>  Also, when you have the opportunity, we will be able to view more detailed data. </blockquote><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/9g/bd/bo/9gbdbo0dtln9qml7gtytuw_ddem.png"><br><br>  As you can see, the cost of one useful transition, which at least became interested in something on our website, was about $ 25.  But this did not mean that the user ordered a server, or at least hosting for $ 1.  And this cost turned out to be much more expensive than the predictions of Alexander, who assumed that it would be in the range of 100-200 UAH ($ 4- $ 8).  But the topic was too complicated ... The only explanation I managed to get. <br><br>  If the subject is so complex, why not lower prices?  After all, it is obvious that with such prices per target click (microconversion) - such advertising is simply unprofitable.  And this is not even a full-fledged conversion, which became possible to track after connecting Google Analytics.  Excellent system, but again, extremely confusing and incomprehensible for a simple man in the street. <br><br>  At the beginning, Alexander made the settings to see target clicks for the last period: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/rt/ik/w6/rtikw6yej9btppo5uoyjtq4s1xs.jpeg"><br><br>  You could also see what the user actually watched and how long: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/sz/x8/2k/szx82kj7byknb35jja_r-dtxogq.jpeg"><br><br>  Later, Alexander added the ‚Äúorder funnel‚Äù to track how many of the users reached the ‚ÄúBasket‚Äù stage, or the ‚ÄúClient panel‚Äù: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/hr/th/9h/hrth9hejuymveff1bpcjegeytp4.jpeg"><br><br>  Ideally, if you understand the system, you can configure the system so that it will display how many products and at what price customers order and the source of these customers. , Habr, Geektimes,       Adwords.           .      ,      ,   - .         . <br><br>       ,  ,  .        : <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/sl/yo/xe/slyoxezdlvdbxomg7kgps9m36cq.jpeg"><br><br>          .   : <br><blockquote>    ,     ,    GDN. <br><br>   ,     ,     .
