  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Car wash Raise through Yandex Direct?</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  What can help online car wash on a street with low traffic, which barely makes ends meet? <br><br>  And if you collect customers through Yandex Direct? <br>  The task for the advertiser is not interesting, not creative. <br>  So. <br>  What did: <br>  Step 1. Analyzed the consumer - who can be a consumer of services, how far a client is willing to go for washing or other services, how to make a client permanent. <br>  Step 2 Analyzed the environment - how many competitors are around, what services they provide, what is their cost, what is their load, strengths and weaknesses, competitors experience successful and not very competitive advantages. <br>  Step 3 Start writing campaign in Yandex Direct. <br><br>  We write the first word: car wash. <br><a name="habracut"></a>  Those who write keywords for companies in Yandex Direct, know that after the first word a whole stream of words is spilled onto the sheet, which in the opinion of the author may be a query.  Then the flow becomes weaker, weaker, the words no longer pour out, but are squeezed out, attracted "behind the ears", are exhausted, and finally a stupor comes - no words.  After some time, something else comes to mind.  In the end, we have a basic set of keywords. <br>  Next, take each word from the base list and turn on the fantasy.  We think how a consumer can write them (using possible typos, errors, slang, etc.) - here you can try it yourself.  How many variants of writing a well-known brand Hyundai in two languages ‚Äã‚Äãcan you offer?  I got 37. I keep quiet about yogurt. <br>  Next, we start working with minus words: <br>  The first level is not targeted queries.  In our case, we sell the service and, accordingly, we do not need inquiries related to the process technology: ‚ÄúChemistry for washing, equipment for washing, rental of washing, organization of washing, etc.‚Äù.  Subtract the words car wash - Kercher.  Also a field for fantasy.  How many spelling variations can this consumer use? <br>  The second level minus words is geo-targeting.  In Yandex Direct you advertise for the whole of Moscow, and in fact the degree of localization is much higher and then you start minus geographical names: districts - SAO, NEAD, HLW, areas - Strogino, Kuntsevo, historical names - Zamoskvorechye, Gagarinsky, metro stations - Akademicheskaya, Kursk, streets - Profsoyuznaya, Vrashavskoe, Enthusiasts. <br>  So, a consumer usually chooses two points to wash a car: near the house or near the work.  As shown by surveys of acquaintances and friends, distance is critical for washing (no more than 10 minutes from home or work or on the way from home to work), price, quality, convenience and safety (especially for women).  But this is the question of compiling ads in Yandex Direct. <br>  If the car wash is taken for the lower price segment, then add queries with the words cheap, not expensive.  If your potential client is in the premium segment, then quality, VIP.

      A car wash is not only a wash of the car, but also a dry-cleaning of the cabin, polishing of the body, washing the engine - and these additional services sometimes make up up to 30% of the company's revenue.  Requests for additional services are placed on individual announcements.  The client is asked to polish the body - the answer in Yandex Direct is not about a car wash, but rather about polishing the body. <br>  Result: <br>  Campaign development took 2 weeks (with adjustments and clarifications). <br>  The result for washing 12 corporate contracts for 6 months (all customers came via the Internet), full filling of the car wash and 2-3 new customers daily for additional services - and all this with a monthly budget for Yandex Direct - 12,000 rubles.  per month. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/88530/">https://habr.com/ru/post/88530/</a></p>
