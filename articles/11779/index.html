I am afraid that they still did not understand me. However, there would be no happiness, because unhappiness helped :).  What happened that was bound to happen inevitably happened: I was finally buried, or rather, finally buried in news2.ru.  <a href="http://www.itechbridge.com/forum/index.php%3Fshowtopic%3D13003">My</a> saddest <a href="http://www.itechbridge.com/forum/index.php%3Fshowtopic%3D13003">predictions</a> almost came true.  I say ‚Äúalmost‚Äù, as long as it turns out that the administration of news2.ru was still using the shovel.  This ritual procedure was done by the members of the virtual community of my favorite :) social resource.  Although, frankly, I do not even know what would be better.  After all, no one has yet proved that ochlocracy is better than autocracy.  But more on that later. <br><br><blockquote>  <em>Your reputation: -12.</em> <em><br></em>  <em>The account will be temporarily blocked.</em> </blockquote><br><br>  This very concise message appeared on my screen when I next accessed news2.ru.

    <blockquote>  <strong>About the background</strong> </blockquote><br><br>  My reputation, as well as the rating in news2.ru, began to drop slowly but surely, after the results were published, as it seemed to me then, a very inoffensive micro-research ‚Äú <a href="http://www.itechbridge.com/forum/index.php%3Fshowtopic%3D11436">Why does news2.ru need a shovel?</a>  ".  Despite the fact that positive feedback was significantly more negative, the weight of the latter was much higher.  After all, they went under the guise of "problems", in other words, "bury", intended primarily to deal with garbage.  Although the problems for some reason, and carried a rather subjective "not interesting." <br><br>  This duality, as I expected, played a role.  Any information with which you disagree is equivalent to dirt, well, and the source of the latter, of course, is subject to isolation.  Then everything is simple.  All my subsequent notes and comments (which I later, in general, stopped doing) were subjected to the same treatment.  Reputation (a good word, reallyÔÅä) my suffering suffered more and more.  The result of the fight against dissent is obvious: there is no person ‚Äî there is no ‚Äúproblem,‚Äù as the baleen leader liked to sentence. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  <em>The following sections of this article can be found on my iTech Bridge <a href="http://www.itechbridge.com/forum/index.php%3Fshowtopic%3D24853">blog</a> : About my reputation, About virtual resurrection, About the little man.</em>  <em>Here I will give in a somewhat abbreviated version only two final ...</em> <br><br><blockquote>  <strong>On the differences between habrahabr and news2.ru</strong> </blockquote><br><br>  Remember, the heroine of one clip of the late nineties sang: ‚Äúthe weather is most important in the house‚Äù?  So the "weather" in the house of habrahabr is much nicer than in news2.  Looks like the first resource is still more intelligent.  And believe me, not only because with the same performances as a whole, my karma and habrasil (how these two assessments differ until you figure it out) are constantly growing, and the reputation and rating in the second resource is steadily falling. <br><br>  The reasons for such different assessments of my modest activity are not entirely clear.  After all, according to my observations, at least a quarter of these two communities overlap.  One of two things: either ‚Äú <a href="http://www.itechbridge.com/forum/index.php%3Fshowtopic%3D18157">rats and cockroaches</a> ‚Äù, in fact, gradually leave clean places, or adapt to the conditions of existence (to the weather in the house).  But who still creates this weather: ranking algorithms ?, administration ?, leaders ?, all together?  Trying to determine.  Will you help? <br><br>  I can not say that I like everything so much in habrahabr.  For example, my performance, it seemed to me, depends on the performance of my friends.  If this is so, then I can‚Äôt agree with the principle ‚Äútell me who your friend is ...‚Äù.  However, that is another question ... <br><br><blockquote>  <strong>About what I'm looking for ... again</strong> </blockquote><br><br>  I really want to be properly understood.  You can read me or not read, love or not love, be friends with me or not be friends.  With my thoughts, you can agree or disagree, stand with me on the same or different ideological platforms.  <em>My notes</em> can be rated by <em>any</em> algorithm. <br><br>  The only thing that in a free society, even if it is Internet, cannot be done with me - it is a <em>subjective</em> assessment of <em>me personally</em> , combed under someone's comb.  I do not want my ‚Äúreputation‚Äù, ‚Äúkarma‚Äù or what else you call it determined by the herd sense of the crowd. <br><br>  I can not bury, bury, prohibit, or ban (if you prefer this word) for my thoughts, which are your right not to share.  Even if they do not agree with 99%.  Otherwise, we will come to a new form of Bolshevism, from whose ancestral birthmarks we rid ourselves with such difficulty.  We will come to a society where the majority, manipulated by clever commissioners who are always right, dictate their laws to the minority.  We will live "according to the concepts" of the crowd of web Bolsheviks.  Crowds that make the rest dance to her tune, no matter what tune comes from this tune. <br><br>  Having only interested one reader, without offending anyone else, I already have the right to ‚Äúlive‚Äù in society.  Of course, if this society considers itself free.  And in the other I, frankly, live and do not intend to.  Let it be arbitrarily virtual ... <br>  <em>I remind you that this note is completely posted in <a href="http://www.itechbridge.com/forum/index.php%3Fshowtopic%3D24853">iTech Bridge</a> .</em> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/11779/">https://habr.com/ru/post/11779/</a></p>
