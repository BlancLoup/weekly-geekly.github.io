And withdraw money abroad, of course.  It is not so easy to isolate among all these operations the dark deeds of fraudsters. <br><br>  In addition, dealers from JokerStash, as they have become, lay out the goods in small portions, so as not to block it all at once.  This means that the leakage will subside, and half of them will not be sold.  For comparison: in December, they increased the data of 7 million cards, and so far only a quarter have been laid out.  Of the new batch, 125 thousand credit cards are being sold, and only 5 million have been stolen. <a name="habracut"></a><br><br><h3>  Handwork </h3><br>  <a href="https://threatpost.ru/goscanssh-worming-its-way-into-linux-devices/25326/">News</a>

      Security researchers have discovered a new malware for Linux systems.  The name GoScanSSH, apparently, invented the akyn, according to the principle ‚Äúwhat I see - I sing about‚Äù: the malware is written in the Go language, scans the network, infects the devices through the SSH port.  If he had done something, then there would have been written ‚Äúspy‚Äù or ‚Äúwiper‚Äù, but the fact is that he ... is not doing anything else yet.  For what purposes, the attackers intend to use the network collected with its help, it is still unclear, but one thing is for sure: they do not have to take meticulousness and hard work. <br><br>  To begin with, when scanning a network, the malware carefully checks whether it has stumbled upon servers belonging to a military or government organization.  If there is even the slightest doubt, the attack stops immediately.  Then he spends brute force, going through more than 7,000 frequently used combinations of logins and passwords.  If it is possible to pick it up, it penetrates the system and sends information about its parameters to the command server. <br><br>  After that, the hackers behind the attack manually configure a new version of their creation, each time based on the features of the server or device found, and manually upload it.  So far, experts have found 70 variations, and this is clearly not the limit. <br><br>  Why such thorough preparation is needed is not yet clear.  Hardly for mining: the specifics of the bruteforce makes it clear that the new malware is designed not only for servers, but also for IoT devices, from which it is inconvenient to get cryptocurrency.  Maybe for DDoS attacks?  In general, the intrigue is growing.  Obviously, it will have to learn the hard way. <br><br><h3>  MyFitnessPal - not only calories are lost </h3><br>  <a href="https://threatpost.ru/under-armour-reports-massive-breach-of-150-million-myfitnesspal-accounts/25421/">News</a> <br><br>  Other craftsmen attacked the supporters of healthy lifestyles.  From the free calorie counter MyFitnessPal leaked data 150 million accounts.  However, according to the assurances of the owner of the application - Under Armor, the attackers did not touch the credit cards, they only stole logins and passwords. <br><br>  By a leak led mess with encrypted credentials.  Along with the more robust Bcrypt algorithm, the company still used the old, weak SHA-1 for some records. <br><br>  To the credit of Under Armor, they quickly responded to the leak: four days after its discovery, customers were already notified, and for reliability, both through the application and via email.  So whatever attackers want, they will not force other people's calories to work for themselves. <br><br><h3>  Antiquities </h3><br>  <b>Devil-941</b> <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/_v/9c/7p/_v9c7pxaucrdtrkbepfgeu1vgls.png" align="right" width="200"><br>  Resident very dangerous virus.
