  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Is the National Software Platform a new megapopil or will there be something useful?</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  If someone watches the TV crew, he could replace the landmark speech by V.V.  Putin, in which he expressed bewilderment, where 80 billion rubles for the development of "Electronic Russia" and other state programs on IT disappeared. <br><br>  And so, we are witnessing the launch of a new state project - the National Software Platform, with a very strong focus on open source software (free software. Not always - free, but [usually] - in source codes).  It is interesting to find out what the officials are preparing for us, because the ‚Äúnational platform‚Äù sounds serious and can affect us all. <br><br>  The first sources (read - finance) are in a small document " <a href="http://www.economy.gov.ru/minec/activity/sections/innovations/formation/doc20110405_05">List of technological platforms proposed for approval by the Government Commission on High Technologies and Innovations</a> ", which lists all the technological platforms needed for the development of the Russian Federation in an innovative way.  There are many of them, but we are interested in the National Program Platform.

      In the " <a href="http://www.economy.gov.ru/wps/wcm/connect/140158804662b5b29006deb4415291f1/spravka.doc%3FMOD%3DAJPERES%26CACHEID%3D140158804662b5b29006deb4415291f1">Information on the</a> list of <a href="http://www.economy.gov.ru/wps/wcm/connect/140158804662b5b29006deb4415291f1/spravka.doc%3FMOD%3DAJPERES%26CACHEID%3D140158804662b5b29006deb4415291f1">technological platforms</a> ..." in paragraph 4 lists the types of software that will be included in the GMP.  I recommend to look, but if it is short - everything is listed there, starting with the basic system software: <br>  ‚Ä¢ Operating Systems <br>  ‚Ä¢ Compiler technologies <br>  ‚Ä¢ Virtualization <br>  ‚Ä¢ Web servers <br>  ‚Ä¢ Application Servers <br>  ‚Ä¢ DBMS (including non-relational) <br><br>  to technologies for building electronic government solutions, pattern recognition systems, protecting mobile traffic, artificial intelligence, etc.  etc. <br>  <b>UPDATE - judging by the discussion, no one has studied the list.</b>  <b>And in vain - it is far beyond the operating systems.</b> <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  In fact, I did not find a fairly comprehensive list of what IT is doing (however, I did not find systems for calculating finite elements, hydraulics and other materials). <br><br>  But, why is this list compiled, what to do with the listed types of software?  Developing all this software from scratch is simply unrealistic; it is not enough to buy companies that produce it - there is not enough stabilization fund ... <br>  We read "The main objectives of the proposed technological platform": <br><br>  ‚Ä¢ Changing the cost structure (including government structures) to IT and reorienting financial flows to the domestic market (import substitution). <br>  ‚Ä¢ Ensuring the national security of the country in terms of technological independence and information security. <br>  ‚Ä¢ Elimination of lag in the volume and level of use of IT in the economy, government and public life. <br>  ‚Ä¢ Development of the education system, applied and basic research in the field of IT. <br>  ‚Ä¢ Development of domestic centers for developing world-class information technologies through the expansion of integration links between fundamental and applied science, the education system and industry, including international ones. <br>  ‚Ä¢ Improving the competitiveness of domestic IT products in the domestic and global markets. <br><br>  The goals are exceptionally good.  What is lacking is ‚ÄúIncreasing the moral level of system administrators and programmers (do not open the beer, change the sweater once a week)‚Äù :) <br><br>  The question arises, how to achieve these goals? <br><br>  And here is the answer: <br><br>  - Phased development and implementation of the Russian national software platform (NPP) based on free software (OSS) and domestic proprietary software, which includes the following main components: <br>  ‚Ä¢ Unified technical infrastructure of distributed development, assembly, support and distribution of software solutions and technologies as part of the GMP. <br>  ‚Ä¢ A set of profiles of standards ensuring compatibility of the components of the GMP, a set of appropriate profile management tools and verification tools. <br>  ‚Ä¢ A set of technologies (including basic software components, tools and systems) of efficient software and IT solutions development, implemented as software components, incorporated into a single technical infrastructure. <br>  ‚Ä¢ A set of typical application solutions based on the domestic free software and proprietary applied software of Russian manufacturers included in the common technical infrastructure. <br>  - Increasing the level of literacy in the use of IT, stimulating the implementation of solutions included in the NPP in the public sector and business. <br>  - Integration of domestic developers of open source software in key international projects. <br>  - Development of existing and creation of new domestic teams and scientific schools that combine research, educational and production activities in the field of IT.  Creating a multi-level system of advanced training of IT-personnel. <br><br>  Translating into Russian from ‚Äúbureaucratic‚Äù, the idea seems to be reasonable at all - to take projects with source code, refine them to Russian specifics (localization, documentation, data protection, all kinds of FSTEC and FSB certificates 1G, etc.) and to sell to enterprises (about ‚Äúgiving away‚Äù, as in ‚Äúreal open-source‚Äù it is supposed, you should not even start a conversation, because if the money for licenses inside Russia remains, then this will be real progress and a departure from ‚Äúcolonialism‚Äù ). <br><br>  But the use of terms and stable expressions like ‚Äúuniform infrastructure‚Äù, ‚Äúset of profiles‚Äù, ‚Äúincreasing literacy level‚Äù, ‚Äúintegration‚Äù ... leads to reflections. <br>  Say, "smells like sawdust"?  ‚ÄúBut because there is no specifics on what to do and how to do it, which means that you can concoct a couple of dozen reports and‚Äú close the questions ‚Äù, and what the real result will be is unknown. <br>  But these are all suspicions and assumptions, so to speak, although based on established practice. <br><br>  The main problem is the cardinal, I would say, the deepest difference in approaches between the development of open source projects and the working methods of the state machine. <br><br>  An open-source project can be managed <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/open_source/116386/">differently</a> , but the essence is the same - interested companies, although they influence developers, never fully ‚Äúfall‚Äù under the ‚Äúcustomer‚Äù (in the sense of the consumer of features), even if it is the US Department of Defense or (suddenly ) Russian Government.  The interaction takes place at the level of grants for developers and groups of developers who perform certain tasks within a roadmap product.  Nobody owns the code, and decisions are made by the community. <br><br>  And how does [our] government work?  It creates plans (by whom made?) And requires their implementation.  It doesn‚Äôt matter that the plans do not give real results, and even the Prime Minister doesn‚Äôt know what happened to 80 billion or so, the main thing is that there are plans, there are reports, you can give money for it (and, as a result, money is easy to cut). <br><br>  It would seem that declaring the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãswitching to open source open source software, one could think about creating flexible methods of interaction with the developers of open-source products ... <br><br>  The process is at the very beginning, and although [potentially] all is not lost, there is a feeling that <br>  NPP will be another glade covered with fresh stumps. <br><br>  Now it is known that concern Sirius will be engaged in the National Program Platform. <br>  Here is a site for NPP created <a href="http://tp-npp.ru/">http://tp-npp.ru</a> , July 1, something signed. <br><br>  An interesting question - to whom did any of the real open-source developers address these people?  How will open-source projects be selected for the ‚Äúunified technical infrastructure‚Äù, by what criteria and contests? <br>  So far, only questions, no answers, but I would like the creation of a national software platform to be discussed with the Russian IT community. <br></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/123848/">https://habr.com/ru/post/123848/</a></p>
