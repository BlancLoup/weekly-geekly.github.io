  <section class="page js-page"><h1>ALTNET officially came out to work in the Russian market</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"> What some customers of <a href="http://altnet.lv/ru/">the ALTNET</a> Latvian <a href="http://altnet.lv/ru/">data center</a> have long asked for <br>  finally accomplished.  We opened a Russian organization, about how to open an LLC, what are the pitfalls at the beginning of doing business today and let's talk ... <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Have you decided to start your own business?  This is a path worthy of approval and respect ... <br>  So that the path does not turn out to be winding and thorny, we will share with you our ‚Äúlittle discoveries‚Äù (in foreign journals, this would be a <b>tip and tricks</b> type heading). <br>  1) We determine the legal form: they can be different - the most common among commercial enterprises is the individual entrepreneur (IP), a limited liability company (LLC), a closed joint-stock company (CJSC), an open joint-stock company (JSC) <br>  <i>We chose LLC, it seemed to us that this is the most convenient form for a start-up enterprise.</i> <i><br></i>  <i>We do not like SP for one reason: he is responsible for all his property for his business.</i>  <i>An LLC is only responsible within its authorized capital.</i> <br>  2) We determine the types of activities that we will conduct: <br>  There is a ALL-RUSSIAN CLASSIFICATOR OF ECONOMIC ACTIVITIES (OKVED), in which you should select activity codes.  In this case, you should choose a code in which there would be at least one point.  Ie you should not take 92 (section), but it is worth taking 92.1,92.2,92.3. <br>  <i>We chose about a dozen species.</i>  <i>As far as we understand, this list is inconclusive and, if necessary, it can be expanded if necessary ...</i> <br>  3) Further, we RECOMMEND you to carefully read the Tax Code of the Russian Federation in order to choose a taxation system. You should analyze what expenses you have, what incomes you will have, and who you are going to work with. <br>  Most start-up companies prefer to choose the simplified tax system (simplified taxation system). <br>  USN is either 6% of income, or 15% (in some regions of the Russian Federation this figure is less, local authorities make decisions about it!) From the ‚Äúamount of income-expenses‚Äù.  The only drawback: the list of expenses is strictly limited to the relevant article of the Tax Code. <br>  <i>In our activity - the most important customers, it is organizations and enterprises.</i>  <i>And such structures usually work with the allocation of VAT (value added tax).</i>  <i>We decided that the USN was good, but we would have to work on the usual tax system.</i> <br>  <a href="http://www.altnetwork.ru/">AU (!) Russian enterprises -&gt; you are interested in renting racks and servers at reasonable prices?</a>  <a href="http://www.altnetwork.ru/">This can be done with us!</a>  <a href="http://www.altnetwork.ru/">Contracts, acts, invoices and invoices for VAT deductions will be provided with pleasure!</a> <a href="http://www.altnetwork.ru/"><br></a> <br>  4) We begin to fill out the documents for registration, you will need: <br>  - decision on creation (minutes of the meeting of participants); <br>  - charter; <br>  - a statement in the prescribed form P1001, which after filling must be notarized (costs 1000 rubles) <br>  - registration fee (4000rub) <br>  "Purely theoretically," this would have been enough, but at Moscow Tax 46, which deals with registrations, they additionally require confirmation of the legal address and the presence of paid-up share capital.  We will not argue with registrars .. :) ... just add: <br>  - a copy of the document of ownership <br>  - letter of guarantee to the legal address <br>  - a copy of the payment of the authorized capital <br>  The authorized capital is paid in any bank to the cashier to a special savings account.  At the time of registration, LLC must be paid 50% of the share capital. <br>  Additionally (so as not to run and not fuss), you can pass: <br>  - application for a copy of the charter <br>  - A copy of the receipt for the state fee for a copy of the statute (400 rubles) <br>  - a copy of the charter <br>  - application for the transition to a simplified tax system (if you need it) <br>  <i>If among the founders are not only resident individuals of the Russian Federation, the list of pieces of paper swells to impropriety (check with the tax authority ..)</i> <br>  5) We take a queue in the crowd of ‚Äúthirsty‚Äù, get a receipt about the reception and start to wait for 5 working days ... <br>  6) After 5 days (‚Äúif success‚Äù) we receive a certificate of registration of a legal entity, a certificate of registration, a letter from the Statistics, an extract from the Register and a copy of our Charter (certified tax) -&gt; the whole enterprise can start economic activity ... <br>  <i>We managed to overcome the registration barrier only at the second attempt.</i>  <i>By the way, in case of refusal, no documents will be returned to you ... by the way, by the way, too ..</i> <br>  Now what? <br>  7) We go to the bank, write an application, close the savings account and open a current account. <br>  <u>Now a small digression:</u> our officials seem to me never to leave alone the process of taxes and fees unambiguous, simple and easy to understand.  Therefore, a ‚Äúpermanent stress process‚Äù for accountants and HR managers is simply guaranteed.  Once upon a time in the dashing 90-x, enterprises deducted from the salary certain interest in various extra-budgetary funds, then they came to the conclusion that "it is inconvenient neither for numerous auditors, nor for enterprises."  Instead of deductions, the law on unified social tax (the Unified Social Tax) was published, the essence of which is simple to disgrace;  The only misfortune -&gt; only tax could check the enterprises.  What do ‚Äúwanting to check‚Äù lobbyists do?  That's right, push through the law on the abolition of the unified social tax.  Since 2010, we will again pay separately to each fund, and each fund will carry out the brain with its own ‚Äústandards, forms and rules.‚Äù.  I would venture to make a prediction that in a couple of years they will again say that ‚Äúit is necessary to simplify life‚Äù and again they will introduce something like the Unified Social Tax (as they call it another matter).  Personally, I see all this ‚Äúmuddy porridge of changes‚Äù only a very large interest of such IT-companies that simply live on money from numerous changes in legislation.  I started typing the names of the ‚Äúheroes of this market‚Äù, but then changed my mind and erased it.  You know those names without me ... <br>  8) They opened a current account -&gt; and started a 7-day counter (!). <br>  Within 7 working days, you must fill out notices and take them and hand them over to your tax office, the Pension Fund and the Social Insurance Fund (Social Insurance Fund).  The forms of notices in each organization are naturally different.  Fill in your details, print in 2 copies each notice (one hand in, ask the second receiving employee to leave an autograph and a seal about the reception ..). <br>  The funny thing is that the size of the responsibility "for failure to provide information" you can be fined <br>  tax on 5000 rubles (art. 118 of the Tax Code of the Russian Federation), and the FSS and the Pension Fund of Russia for 50 rubles for each document ... <br>  9) Do not forget that for new organizations in the next month before the 20th day it is required to submit tax reports on the average number of employees. If the company does not submit a report, it can be fined 50 rubles (clause 1 of article 126 of the RF Tax Code).  A manager - in the amount of 300 to 500 rubles (Art. 15.6 of the Administrative Code of the Russian Federation). <br>  ... <br>  Well, I have no more positive thoughts on starting a business in Russia today. <br>  Those who wish to purchase a <a href="http://www.altnetwork.ru/">hosting service</a> are always welcome! <br>  If the topic of ‚Äúdoing business in the Russian Federation‚Äù is relevant for you, then it will be possible to continue it. <br>  (in principle, probably for small enterprises, the topic with the simplified taxation system is more relevant, but in my opinion - there is a lot of such information on the Internet ..). <br>  Of course, when an office is BIG, then separately people deal with issues of tax, accounting and personnel records, while we‚Äôll do it with us.  For this food for notes will be more than enough.  I am ready to answer any questions either at habrakochta or at: <br>  <b>My nickname</b> (aT) <b>box on Mail.ru</b> ... <br>  Successes you in business! </div>
