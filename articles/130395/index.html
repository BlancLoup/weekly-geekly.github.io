  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Mobile application developer brief: 15 key questions to ask the client</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  <i>The mobile marketing market is constantly growing, new developers are coming, new interesting projects are being created.</i>  <i>We try to keep up with the times.</i>  <i>That is why our community is now called <b>Digital Professionals Hub</b> and you can read materials not only about the features of web development, but also about topical issues that a mobile application developer can touch.</i> <br><br>  So let's start with the main thing!  Before proceeding with the development, it is necessary to clarify in detail all the requirements of the customer. <br>  In order to develop a successful application, you need to do everything right from the very beginning.  The main number of conflicts between the customer and the developer is due to the lack of documents defining the details of what needs to be worked out.  Not all questions are required to fill out, but it is very important to immediately convey to the client the importance of working through the task from the first steps. <br><br>  <b>The first part of the brief: questions to help determine which particular application your customer needs</b> <br><a name="habracut"></a><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/f95/4c1/525/f954c152573ad14d1de36263c87f4f3f.jpg" align="right">  To begin with, we will understand what the customer‚Äôs company is doing, and what purpose it has in ordering an application from you.  What kind of results the client is going to achieve with the help of the application: to help increase the influx of customers directly, to collect the target audience, to increase sales, to implement the mobile part of the integrated advertising campaign, to speed up or optimize logistics processes (something else?) <br>  <i>So, questions that will help determine with whom you are dealing, and what kind of application your client needs.</i> 
      <br>

      1. What does your company do? <br>  2. How do you plan to use the application in your business? <br>  3. What type of application do you need?  (here it is worth pointing out for clients a brief description of the types of applications) <br>  4. What results do you want to achieve with this application? <br><br>  <b>The second part of the brief: the definition of the functional and technical features of the application.</b> <br>  Let's go to the application itself.  To make life easier for the client and not to force him to explain on fingers what functionality is required from the application, ask him to show several examples of such applications.  Let him note that he likes in these applications, and what he sees in them cons.  So the customer will more fully define the list of basic functional blocks. <br>  Not less important is the question for which platforms the application should work: here the client will most likely need your help - he is unlikely to understand the intricacies of compatibility.  Tell him about the features and benefits of various platforms and technologies, the client will be grateful for your help.  For example, iOS leads in North America and Europe, but in Russia, Africa and Asia, Nokia Symbian is the most popular platform. <br>  <i>We determine the functionality and technical characteristics:</i> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/854/6da/d43/8546dad433f0eb4925d24ea78f8192a3.jpg" align="right">  5. Give examples of such applications. <br>  6. What exactly do you like about these examples? <br>  7. What solutions in such applications do not you like? <br>  8. List the main functionality of the future application: <ul><li>  What should an application be able to do? </li><li>  What are the main functional blocks you can select? </li><li>  How will the application be used by the end user? </li></ul>  9. For which platforms should the application work?  (Apple iOS, Nokia Symbian, Windows Phone? Blackberry, Android, Sony Ericsson, Samsung) <br>  10. For which platform should you implement the application in the first place? <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/57a/e01/857/57ae018575d3ae9297a07e9c7a41136d.jpg" align="left">  <b>The third part of the brief: the post-development stage, technical support and update support</b> <br>  It is very important to discuss who and how will support and update the application.  The customer may entrust support to you, or may wish independence.  Are there any IT specialists in the company who can do this?  If there is no such expert, you will most likely need an application management system with a user-friendly interface. <br><br>  <i>So, the final group of questions:</i> <br>  11. How should the data be updated in the application? <br>  12. Is there a need to develop a site application? <br>  13. Who will be involved in technical support of the application?  Is maintenance required after warranty service of this application? <br>  14. Is there a need to create an application management system? <br>  15. Who will own the copyright to the application and in what form (exclusive or non-exclusive rights)?  This question should not be left "by default" <br><br>  <b>And the last is the contact information of the client.</b> <br>  Find out who the customer will oversee this project.  It is useful to understand whether this person is an IT specialist or not: it will help you choose the language of communication with the contact person.  Check all methods of communication: e-mail, Skype, work and mobile phone numbers. <br>  Drawing up such a brief will allow you to make a commercial offer, and a client to see a professional in you. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/130395/">https://habr.com/ru/post/130395/</a></p>
