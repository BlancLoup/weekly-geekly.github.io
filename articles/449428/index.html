  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Ford will build an electric car using EV-startup Rivian's tech</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/zi/qt/g6/ziqtg6ptui-gyxmjmulvtgiarxy.jpeg"><br><br>  Ford Motor Company has <a href="https://media.ford.com/content/fordmedia/fna/us/en/news/2019/04/24/rivian-500-million-investment-ford.html">announced</a> an investment of $ 500 million in a startup EV Rivian and is going to build an electric car using its technology.  According to Ford CEO Jim Hekkett, as well as investors and journalists, the new car will be self-developed and will not affect the two Ford electric cars: the F-150 and the crossover Mustang. <br><br>  In particular, Ford will build its car based on the Rivian's ‚Äúflexible skateboard platform‚Äù, which includes a battery, an electrical transmission, and the electric architecture <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/11/26/18111782/rivian-r1t-electric-pickup-price-specs-la-auto-show-2018">of the R1T</a> and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/11/27/18113257/rivian-r1s-suv-electric-la-auto-show-2018">R1S SUV</a> <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/11/26/18111782/rivian-r1t-electric-pickup-price-specs-la-auto-show-2018">pickup</a> .  Ford will also receive a minority stake in Rivian in exchange for investment.  Ford has already decided which car he will build on the Rivian platform, although he hasn‚Äôt yet clarified this. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Just two months ago, Rivian and Amazon <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/2/15/18226146/amazon-ev-startup-electric-pickups-suvs-fu">announced an investment round</a> of $ 700 million.  Rivian also negotiated with GM, but the startup <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-04-17/amazon-backed-rivian-spurned-gm-with-plans-to-build-for-others">reportedly</a> refused a potential exclusive deal.  Rivian CEO RJ Scaringe said that Rivian makes ‚Äúseveral models‚Äù for other companies and ‚Äúis very focused on the relationships that we are building now by launching our own products‚Äù.

      Previously <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/1/15/16892386/ford-electric-car-11-billion-2022-detroit-auto-show-2018">, Ford</a> announced the allocation of 11 billion dollars for the development of electric vehicles, starting with the crossover Mustang, which is due at the end of this year.  ‚ÄúWe have a lot of electrification experience,‚Äù said Joe Hinrix, Ford president of automotive operations.  ‚ÄúBut there is also a lot of what we don‚Äôt know yet, and there are things that we can learn from Rivian.  He will also join the Rivian board of directors. <br><br>  Hinriks said that Ford is considering a deal with Rivian as a ‚Äúsignificant opportunity‚Äù to get a new electric car faster and cheaper than if the automaker had developed it from scratch.  ‚ÄúOne of the big advantages you get from working with a start-up company, such as Rivian, with RJ in particular, is the ability to work faster.  So the speed at which a new electric vehicle is released is the most important factor, ‚Äùhe said. <br><br>  Hackett said he was ‚Äúmost impressed‚Äù with the Rivian skateboard technology, praising the originality of the design, noting that Rivian has the freedom to design their electric vehicles from scratch and a clean slate.  ‚ÄúThey did not come from the‚Äú analog world ‚Äù.  They simply ingenious invented, ‚Äùhe said. <br><br>  ‚ÄúWe have the opportunity to learn from Ford in terms of their manufacturing experience, especially when it comes to lightweight structures and, of course, how they effectively manage production,‚Äù said Skaringe. <br><br>  Hackett also said that the Rivian deal will not affect the automaker‚Äôs recent partnership with Volkswagen, which includes <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/1/15/18183498/ford-volkswagen-alliance-trucks-vans-detroit-auto-show-2019">pick-ups</a> .  Ford has been associated with at least one more EV startup: in 2017, he held talks with Lucid Motors, which eventually failed.  Since then, Lucid Motors has received more than $ 1 billion from the sovereign wealth fund of <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/4/23/18512771/former-tesla-model-s-chief-engineer-ev-startup-lucid-motors-rawlinson">Saudi Arabia</a> and continues its project on its own. <br><br>  <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/5/23/17380600/rivian-electric-truck-pickup-suv-interview-rj-scaringe">Rivian</a> became noticeable only in 2018, although the company has been around for about ten years.  Unlike some of the brighter startups EV, Rivian does not announce its first cars until it starts production. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/449428/">https://habr.com/ru/post/449428/</a></p>
