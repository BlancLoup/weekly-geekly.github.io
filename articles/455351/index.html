Initially, it was part of VMworld - a larger event - but since last year the meeting has been held as an independent event (due to the large number of participants).  At EMPOWER, speakers from Intel, Microsoft, CloudHealth, VeloCloud and, of course, VMware itself. <a name="habracut"></a><br><br><blockquote>  Participants share their experience with cloud technologies and raise marketing issues ‚Äî experts discuss customer communication approaches and tools that help businesses develop their services. </blockquote><br>  This year, VMware speakers talked about three areas in which the company plans to continue developing its pool of solutions.

    <h3>  <b>Optimization of digital working environments</b> </h3><br>  The structure of corporate networks is becoming more complex - companies are switching to a hybrid and multi-cloud infrastructure, and their employees are increasingly working remotely using mobile devices.  To meet the new conditions, VMware set a course for solving problems related to centralized administration.  In particular, they talked about managing a digital work environment for customers of IaaS providers. <br><br>  The corporation talked about the capabilities of the <a href="https://habr.com/ru/company/it-grad/blog/352238/">Workspace ONE</a> platform - it allows you to manage client applications, licenses and security policies for end-user devices in one interface.  It also allows you to run virtual desktops in the cloud and manage the life cycle of applications, regardless of the operating system and device used. <br><br>  At the conference, we had the opportunity to explore the features of Workspace ONE on test benches.  You can also do this online at <a href="https://labs.hol.vmware.com/HOL/catalogs/catalog/878">VMware Hands-On Lab</a> . <br><br><h3>  <b>Machine Learning Course</b> </h3><br>  Automation of business processes in data centers - the priority of VMware.  The company expects that in the next few years its solutions based on machine learning will help data centers to reduce the burden on their administrators by 80%.  System administrators will determine the policies and logic of the data center systems, and intelligent algorithms will monitor their execution. <br><br>  VMware has already implemented intelligent functions in a wide range of its products: NSX-T, vRealize Operations &amp; Log Insight, Wavefront Analytics, Apteligent, Skyline, etc. The AI ‚Äã‚Äãsystems analyze the logs, the performance of the infrastructure, balance the load on the servers, and perform technical support work. <br><br>  The corporation implements smart algorithms in the vSAN 6.7 system.  It is a virtualization tool for hypervisor storage.  With the next platform upgrade, the company plans to expand the pool of tasks that AI systems will be engaged in.  Among them - monitoring the state of the disk infrastructure and reporting problems for administrators. <br><br><blockquote>  The speakers also talked about the Pulse 2 IoT infrastructure monitoring solution. It provides the ability to manage smart devices and their clusters using the RESTful API.  According to the developers, the system is capable of supporting the work of one hundred million smart devices. </blockquote><br>  The official VMware blog has <a href="https://blogs.vmware.com/edge/2019/05/20/iot-is-coming-empower-2019-wrap-up/%3Fsrc%3Dso_5a314d05e49f5%26cid%3D70134000001SkJn">an example of how</a> Pulse <a href="https://blogs.vmware.com/edge/2019/05/20/iot-is-coming-empower-2019-wrap-up/%3Fsrc%3Dso_5a314d05e49f5%26cid%3D70134000001SkJn">works</a> in conjunction with the Raspberry Pi 3B +.  A single board computer is responsible for monitoring temperature, humidity, pressure, and other environmental parameters.  Such solutions can be used in data centers to maintain the microclimate in the engine room. <br><br><h3>  <b>Work in untrusted networks</b> </h3><br>  At the conference, VMware unveiled an updated NSX-T platform (to replace the existing NSX-V) for operation in untrusted wide area networks (WAN / LTE).  It includes traffic encapsulation protocols, support for multi-cloud and hybrid environments. <br><br>  The platform also received a new level of abstraction of network devices - with its help, you can restore the infrastructure in one minute when changing physical equipment and even with the complete destruction of the data center. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/kn/85/i7/kn85i7-wenvttq9oexv78wxrqxc.jpeg"><br>  <font color="#A9A9A9"><i>/ photo by <a href="https://unsplash.com/photos/kcJsQ3PJrYU">Andrei Stratu</a> Unsplash</i></font> <br><br>  They also talked about the SD-WAN product from VeloCloud, which the IT giant <a href="https://www.networkworld.com/article/3235963/vmware-acquires-velocloud-what-will-this-mean-for-sd-wan.html">acquired last year</a> .  The solution is designed to protect network connections through unstable networks. <br><br>  It works as follows: smart routers are installed around the perimeter of the segments (for example, a data center or a branch of an organization).  They automatically balance the load and monitor the channels available at the outputs of each segment (fiber, twisted pair or LTE).  The SD-WAN infrastructure allows you to mix traffic tunneling protocols on the fly. <br><br>  This approach makes the network more productive and flexible.  Guido Roberto Frabotti (Guido Roberto Frabotti), lead engineer for SD-WAN at VMware, said that the system would allow to forget about such a thing as jitter. <br><br><hr><br>  <i>In general, we still have extremely positive impressions of the conference and the technological developments presented by VMware.</i>  <i>Conference speakers paid a lot of attention to tasks and solutions related to security and data recovery, work in global networks and centralized management.</i> <i><br><br></i>  <i>New VMware products will increase the stability of the processes occurring in the IT infrastructure and optimize the work of VMware partner companies.</i>  <i>We plan to further develop the infrastructure of our IaaS provider based on the corporation hypervisor.</i> <br><br><hr><br>  We will continue to talk about VMware updates, and a detailed report on each of the days of the EMPOWER 2019 conference is already in our blog on Habr√©: <br><br><ul><li>  <a href="https://habr.com/ru/company/it-grad/blog/452840/">VMware EMPOWER 2019 Conference: how was your first day</a> </li><li>  <a href="https://habr.com/ru/company/it-grad/blog/453096/">IoT, AI systems and network technologies - we continue to broadcast with VMware EMPOWER 2019</a> </li><li>  <a href="https://habr.com/ru/company/it-grad/blog/453346/">Data Storage and Protection Technologies - Third Day at VMware EMPOWER 2019</a> </li></ul></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/455351/">https://habr.com/ru/post/455351/</a></p>
