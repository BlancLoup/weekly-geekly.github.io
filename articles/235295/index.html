All last year I actively monitored the market in search of the right for my requirements - and did not find it.  Only one way out - make your own.  Further, the story of the computer desk of my dreams. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  But before moving on to the main point, I‚Äôll tell you what was so special about what I needed from the table, which I could not find anywhere. <br>  I love to grumble at the computer, play toys.  Powerful computer - a lot of space.  But in a small apartment where I live, it is difficult to find on a permanent basis a place where I would not interfere with anyone or someone would not interfere with me, so I want to be able to move the table with the computer within the apartment.  I have long rejected gaming laptops, because it is expensive, much less productive, deprives of the pleasure of digging into a computer. <br><br>  Thus was born the first mandatory requirement for the table - <b>mobility</b> .

      All searches in this section lead, basically, to the same result: the table is small, uncomfortable, ugly. <br><br>  So a few more requirements appeared: it should be at least 80 cm wide, i.e.  <b>comfortable</b> , with the ability to stretch the legs (without any shelves there and other nonsense) and <b>pretty</b> enough. <br><br>  In principle, already at this stage I realized that my requirements are almost mutually exclusive - either beautiful, convenient and immobile, or mobile, small and inconvenient. <br><br>  I have found a temporary compromise in the desk Bureaucrat DL-083.  The design is so-so, but this is the best that I managed to find, considering the requirements.  Instead of standard legs, wheels are easily screwed in, and the table, with its dimensions, is able to move. <br>  Here are some photos with different usage scenarios: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/95f/bb0/2a1/95fbb02a104541a19a5d11f861364feb.JPG"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/479/457/40b/47945740ba1a47558787341e05a9c922.JPG"><br><br>  UPS had to be put on the table at the monitor, which is not very good, as he piloted the floor a couple of times, but you can move around without even turning off the computer, a kind of overgrown laptop.  There were design flaws: the metal frame did not allow to move the monitor away from itself, and 27 inches barely fit in.  Plus, I had to upgrade a little to get through the 60-centimeter door. <br><br>  Very quickly, I realized that the flimsy design of the table is not particularly adapted to movement: the computer itself is about 40 kg, plus some small things on the upper shelves give the table such a windiness that it becomes scary to move it.  After a little more time, it was found that the seats of the twisting of the wheels also carry all this heavily and are bent in different directions under the weight of my idea.  However, for more than six months, he successfully served me in the scenario of a residential nomad and did not fall apart. <br><br>  So I slowly approached the idea that what I need, I can only do.  I climbed on DIY-forums, habrahabra, looked at what people were doing for their computers, whether my worries and dreams shared.  I saw a lot of good and different tables (not for me to evaluate them) and realized that I would have to reinvent the wheel from the very beginning.  There were, however, very interesting tables, but still not that.  The favorite, of course, is the article <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/91646/">The Boomburum Office</a> is a very cool decision, but, after weighing its capabilities and requirements, decided that this was also not my option, and finally formulated everything I needed from the dream computer desk: <br><br><ul><li>  mobile; </li><li>  convenient; </li><li>  nothing extra (no additional shelves and levels); </li><li>  the drawer shelf under the keyboard should be at least 84 cm so that it can comfortably fit a large keyboard with an additional unit and a large comfortable mouse pad;  height to fit the Microsoft Natural Ergonomic Keyboard; </li><li>  not chipboard (crumble when moving); </li><li>  minimum of metal (solid solid construction will look ugly, and I already had an example of a non-massive construction); </li><li>  with an interesting design that fits into the home interior; </li><li>  with the ability to accommodate a Full Tower system block up to 600 mm in height (so that after the next upgrade there is no need to make a new table); </li><li>  a depth of about 60 cm (optimal size for convenience and not to get stuck in my kitchen door); </li><li>  separate hidden niche for UPS. </li></ul><br><br>  Here, perhaps, that's all.  I love to work with a tree, so in simple terms - I decided to be confused. <br>  I didn‚Äôt want to plan such a project without preliminary preparation, so I began to study what programs exist for furniture design.  Searches on the same DIY forums led me to Google SketchUp.  A very easy to learn program and after a few lessons gives a feeling of omnipotence.  Looking for inspiration on various design and professional sites, I drew this: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/132/be4/0b5/132be40b5e2140718c7d1f38e2382930.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/8f4/ab9/3aa/8f4ab93aa911401ab9e45125ac27fa94.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/8ae/2ac/8a2/8ae2ac8a222842f6ab5410cd709d44fe.jpg"><br><br>  I admired it for a long time, showed it to my relatives and friends, finished drawing it on trifles, modifying the construction.  It took quite a long time before I decided to go directly to the implementation of the idea.  Despite my desire to make a table with my own hands, I, having weighed all the pros and cons, thought that I would not like to screw up the project of my dream with my own hands (there are a lot of exact dimensions with which it is impossible to miss), so it was decided Seek help and outsource sales to your friends who are engaged in furniture production.  After talking with the master, there were weak points: it was necessary to strengthen the strength of the structure.  Therefore, due to the back wall and the extended left vertical panel created an additional frame stiffness.  At the same time, a little more refined the design, size and design (the correct dimensions are only in the first picture).  It turned out this: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/2b2/4a3/702/2b24a370228b45bba10770807c0da34d.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/6db/d98/b5f/6dbd98b5f5b448bf896425255501aefb.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/8dc/487/4f7/8dc4874f739b40609513d972a73b6f0e.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/1a5/012/2b0/1a50122b06664dbcb985c77b70059363.jpg"><br><br>  Well, at the end of the curtain, I tried to make a couple of rendered pictures: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/16d/acb/007/16dacb007a6b490ab2503b9e8fa34e08.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/568/ee4/55c/568ee455c5c448c68d3dae4d2cc67cd9.jpg"><br><br>  At the moment we are buying the material, immersed in the process, the other day we plan to launch the table into production.  I will take intermediate photos and with the result I will definitely return at the end of September.  I would be happy for comments and ideas for improvement, because  there is still an opportunity to make small changes to the project.  And I would also like to find out if I have like-minded people or is my demands all the same a ‚Äúspecial‚Äù case? </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/235295/">https://habr.com/ru/post/235295/</a></p>
