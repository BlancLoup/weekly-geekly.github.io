    <h4>  NYSE Euronext </h4><br>  Data Center Exchange NYSE Euronext is located in the city of Mahva, New Jersey.  The area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe halls for the collocation of the server of traders is about 18 thousand square meters - the area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe building itself is more than 120 thousand square meters.  meters  Data Center Knowledge has <a href="http://www.datacenterknowledge.com/closer-look-nyse-euronexts-nj-data-center/">published</a> some photos of this data center. <br><br>  The object management center - it combines the interfaces of building management systems (BMS) and data center infrastructure management (DCIM).  It is here that specialists sit who control the temperature and humidity modes, the condition of power supplies and other elements in each server room. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/37a/806/0c3/37a8060c316c456b81f17bd50895def0.jpg"><br><br>  And here is what the ‚Äúhot corridor‚Äù looks like, into which the air emitted by the servers enters: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/023/9c5/386/0239c538653f4ae187bb06cc6d19fc26.jpg"><br><br>  The long main corridor of the data center allows you to experience the enormous scale of the object. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/3e7/ca3/659/3e7ca3659c50483a97ae3de05f65d560.jpg"><br><br><h4>  Equinix Financial Hub </h4><br>  Equinix is ‚Äã‚Äãone of the largest global players in the data center and colocation market.  One of its objects is the building of the former factory for the production of glasses in Secaucus state of New York area of ‚Äã‚Äãmore than 100,000 square meters, converted into a modern data center.  Its services are used by such exchanges as NASDAQ, BATS, CBOE, and this is how it looks. <br><br>  Lattices are located on both sides of the long main corridor of the data center;  These grids and racks are connected by a cable that runs along the yellow suspension cable channels. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/2d1/51d/619/2d151d61986f4dd58de4e36bf664774d.jpg"><br><br>  The ceiling height of 12 meters provides a large space for several levels of cable channels, filling the upper part of the data center Equinix, in which there are separate channels for connecting, carrier and power cables. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/6aa/0cf/e1d/6aa0cfe1dbd94a209e832d07bbc5d93f.jpg"><br><br>  An uninterruptible power supply (UPS) room in the Equinix NY4 data center, powered by a 26 megavolt-ampere substation.  The equipment consists of an uninterruptible power supply system with a capacity of 30 megawatts supporting the operation of the computing unit in the event of a power supply system failure. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/8f1/ea2/cfe/8f1ea2cfe10b40c9ae18d344cd5ac1a2.jpg"><br><br>  In the event of a power outage, the NY4‚Äôs data center equipment is equipped with these 18 Caterpillar diesel diesel generators with a capacity of 2.5 megawatts each, which together provide 46 megawatts of emergency power, enough to provide full equipment energy, and refrigeration systems and UPS systems .  During Hurricane Sandy, these generators kept the equipment running for a whole week. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/633/28a/b93/63328ab93cc24bf59d58d5389357fa79.jpg"><br><br>  The cooling system in NY4 is equipped with huge pipes, through which chilled water flows to the equipment, as well as to the plate heat exchanger (right), which acts as a refrigerator in the winter and allows you to save energy that would normally be spent on refrigeration plants. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/6ab/aef/6d1/6abaef6d1aa9435a96212fcb1409606c.jpg"><br><br><h4>  Moscow Exchange, M1 and DataSpace1 data centers </h4><br>  Currently, the largest Russian stock exchange platform <a href="http://moex.com/a1201">offers</a> traders the opportunity to place their equipment in the Moscow data center M1 (address: Varshavskoye Highway, 125). <br><br>  According to the information <a href="http://www.stacktelecom.ru/data_centers/datacenter-m1">provided</a> on the website of the data center operator, it is the largest in the Moscow region - its capacity is 950 server racks.  The data center was commissioned in 2006, its total area is 3,850 square meters, of which 2,400 square meters are allocated for server rooms.  m (load capacity of 5-8 kW per rack). <br><br>  To maintain the necessary temperature regime (22 ¬± 4 degrees) and humidity (45 ¬± 10%), in the server rooms installed ventilation systems and industrial-type precision air conditioners are installed.  Air conditioning components are also reserved under the N + 3 scheme and better.

The data center was commissioned in July 2012.  Its total capacity is 1062 stand-places - 12 machine rooms, each with an area of ‚Äã‚Äãup to 255 square meters.  A separate room will be allocated for the collocation of equipment of bidders.  Photo source below: <i><a href="https://www.dataspace.ru/">dataspace.ru</a> site</i> . <br><br>  There are 6 independent power supply circuits in the data center, each machine room is supplied with electricity from 2 independent circuits. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/86c/d26/cfd/86cd26cfdcc7497ca4c4cacf21c94958.png"><br><br>  Chillers and dry air coolers are installed according to the N + 1 distributed redundancy scheme, cold air is supplied under the floor. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/6a8/3e9/9e8/6a83e99e895c4122b0ec8b69c85e3c15.png"><br><br>  The perimeter of the building and the interior are equipped with an 8-level security system that includes the various components of access control and surveillance. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/f38/683/75a/f3868375ae204c548e9a8f7726fbd7ef.png"><br><br>  According to the Exchange press release on the move to the new data center, DataSpace1 has certificates of Tier III Design Documentation and Tier III Constructed Facility. <br><br><h4>  Conclusion </h4><br>  Exchange platforms and HFT-traders pay great attention to building their own trading infrastructure.  Today in the stock market, success is often separated from failure by fractions of a second, so software and hardware that provide financial applications should work extremely reliably. <br><br>  The load level is so great that it is not easy to cope with it - this requires serious investments from the data center service providers.  Otherwise, there may be situations like the one that <a href="http://www.zerohedge.com/news/2015-08-27/hfts-just-overheated-centurylink-reports-catastrophic-hvac-failure-nj2-data-center-s">occurred</a> in August 2015 at the CenturyLink data center - during serious market movements, the infrastructure for HFT trading worked in an enhanced mode, which the ventilation system (HVAC) did not cope with. <br><br>  As a result, many servers are not just overheated, but physically burned: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/2eb/4a4/0b0/2eb4a40b0bc84f4398e940349974b50d.jpg"></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/274021/">https://habr.com/ru/post/274021/</a></p>
