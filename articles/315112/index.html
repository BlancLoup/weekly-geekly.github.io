      In the process of learning, I constantly analyzed how people perceive information, how much time is needed for its perception, how it is more convenient for them to perceive it, and so on.  And now, after 4 years, I want to share my conclusions and arguments. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  For the most part, we will talk about website development, but this information can be transferred to other areas of our life. <br><br><h3>  The first point of our conversation - universities </h3><br>  We can immediately close this topic for conversation, if you answer one question: "What university of our country can produce a high-quality website developer who does not need to be retrained?". <br><br>  I personally, at one time, entered VGUIT with one goal - to learn how to program.  When we started learning C ++ in Borland C ++ 1997 release, it immediately became clear that there was nothing to catch. <br><br>  The only thing for which you can enroll in a university with an IT bias is that it is not boring.  To just get a diploma and, at the same time, do not die of boredom. <br><br>  After the article came out, many have unleashed a wave of discontent on me.  Like, I'm wrong and the university is a very important part of education.  Therefore, I decided to amend the article. <br><br>  We have universities, which can give a good store of knowledge, but their units.  Much depends on the teacher and the status of the university itself.  Yes, and the training will have to spend 4 years, and this is quite a lot for that baggage of knowledge, which can be obtained much faster. <br><br><h3>  Courses and self-education </h3><br>  I believe that courses without self-education can not live effectively, so I will combine these two points and we will continue to talk about them. <br><br>  I will make a small digression.  The purpose of this article is to find the most effective training, so I will compare different ways to educate a person and describe what they are anyway good or bad. <br><br><h3>  Group training </h3><br>  I have weaned more than one group and noticed an interesting pattern.  1 out of 10 students really becomes a good graduate who can really start making websites. <br><br>  And no matter how many groups I conducted, this conversion of 10% always pursued me. <br><br>  In the long attempts to understand what is the matter, one thought came to me: "People go to learn how to make websites, simply because it is fun."  As a result, they realize that it is not so simple and they reach the end of the course only because they have given money for it and are further engaged in their own affairs. <br><br>  And another reason why this happens.  <i>Group training of people is not effective a priori.</i> <br><br>  Let's see why: <br><br><h3>  1. People perceive information at different speeds. </h3><br>  I do not want to offend anyone, but people are ‚Äúsilly‚Äù, but there are ‚Äúclever‚Äù.  Although in any case these are internal attitudes of a person and, I believe that with the proper approach, ‚Äústupid‚Äù can go to the rank of ‚Äúclever‚Äù and give noses to everyone. <br><br>  Plus, if there are homework in the training, then the people who do them will be one step ahead of everyone else, because they have experience.  BUT!!!  Most of the homework will not do ... it's a fact. <br><br><blockquote>  NO ONE LOVES TO DO HOMES! </blockquote><br>  And no matter how much you explain to a person the importance of homework, he will still try not to do it ... such a strange person is a person. <br><br>  What happens in the end? <br><br>  The lecture begins, you have to study a new topic, but someone else has not completed the previous one ... and this person will have to DO TWO HAMS before the next lesson!  This is stressful ... and, of course, he will not do his homework.  This snowball starts and with each new lecture a person ceases to understand absolutely everything. <br><br>  Common situation?  Not?  Let's tell ... lessons, lectures.  Seem to be?  That is why you do not understand mathematical analysis in your 2nd year of university.  Just because at one time did not make up for a certain amount of knowledge. <br><br><h3>  2. Memory is not so good </h3><br>  What is mainly told at the lecture?  Theory  And now remember at least one lecture that you can immediately repeat by heart after the lecture itself.  None?  Not surprising. <br><br>  Scientists have shown that a person can concentrate his attention on a lecture for only 10-20 minutes.  Then it is useless to tell him something. <br><br>  The result is that it takes 2 hours of lecture.  An hour later, the student remembers nothing of what was at the lecture and begins to understand the notes at home, writes his code and understands that he does not understand anything. <br><br>  I have often had situations when a student the next day after the lecture asked questions that I had discussed and explained in great detail.  With this, the same person in class confirmed that everything is clear. <br><br><h3>  3. There is no individual approach. </h3><br>  Whatever one may say, but each person in the process of learning will have his own questions, he will have his own pitfalls and in order to get around them one must talk to the person personally. <br><br>  Well, if the lesson you can ask questions.  But I have seen more than one lecture, where there are 40-100, and even more people.  As a rule, there are not particularly questions posed. <br><br>  It is difficult for a teacher to find an individual approach for each person in a group.  And it‚Äôs not even so difficult as it‚Äôs just not paid for) These are additional hours of conversation with each participant of the course and the determination of their personal misunderstandings. <br><br>  In the end, after I took the nth number of groups, it was decided to hold <br><br><h3>  Individual training </h3><br>  It was a sensation!  I spent 4 hours with a student for two weeks in the format of skype-dialogs and he had already turned out websites from layouts or created his one-page sites.  Yes, they were not perfect, but you can get somewhere somewhere.  But two weeks and 100% conversion to the result! <br><br>  Not to be unfounded I want to show an example: <a href="https://yadi.sk/i/M5aBD-ffyMw7W">yadi.sk/i/M5aBD-ffyMw7W</a> .  This is the very first site that the student has created in his life.  Isn't it cool? <br><br>  I said about two weeks and 4 hours.  But we had another 4 hours and another two weeks left.  We spent them on ordinary conversations.  The lecture took place as follows. <br><br>  The apprentice of the house makes up the site, then we talk with him and he begins to fill me with questions, and I, accordingly, answer them. <br><br>  As a result, after a month of communication with a person (at that, in total, it was 8 hours of lectures 2 hours a week), he began to freely navigate in the development of websites and he had an understanding of where to go and what languages ‚Äã‚Äãto learn. <br><br>  With this move, I closed two problems at once from group training. <br><br>  a) The information is completely personalized and gives individually for a specific person. <br><br>  b) The student perceives information at a speed convenient for him.  Sometimes there were situations when the student asked to transfer the lesson, because he was in a damn job and did not have time to do homework, or else for some everyday problems.  Accordingly, the training period increased slightly, but, most importantly, the quality did not suffer. <br><br>  But even with such results, there was one thing ... but people do not remember what happens at the lecture.  Anyway, I gave them notes that they read at home and did homework for them. <br><br>  And this model has one very minus.  These are teacher resources.  It is very difficult to spend 5 hours of individual lectures every day.  Very difficult.  This is wildly exhausting, so I abandoned this idea and began to think further. <br><br>  At first, I made several conclusions: <br><br>  <b>1. The</b> student should receive information in small portions and immediately fix it in practice. <br>  <b>2. The</b> student can receive information independently without the help of a teacher and this will be more effective. <br>  <b>3. The</b> student learns more effectively in practice. <br>  <b>4. The</b> student should receive answers to their questions that arise during the practice <br><br>  That is, it turns out that the teacher begins to play the role of an ordinary tutor, who guides you on the right track and answers questions as you go. <br><br>  For a long time I analyzed what questions pupils ask during classes and introduced these questions into the curriculum and notes.  As a result, now all the questions are reduced mostly to three sections: <br><br>  <b>1.</b> Questions about technology.  (What languages ‚Äã‚Äãto learn next?) <br>  <b>2. The</b> nuances of layout.  (If there is any difficult situation in the layout and the student can not solve it independently) <br>  <b>3.</b> Where to go next?  (How to start making money, where to get a job?) <br><br>  Soon I will close these questions with the material and then the role of the teacher will be only one: the presence of the teacher as a generally accepted puzzle in education. <br><br>  The fact is that people are used to being taught by other people.  They consider themselves stupid and ask to teach them.  They sincerely believe that there is such a magical person who will teach them. <br><br>  But in fact, people learn only because of their own work.  They study not at lectures, but at home when they read materials, write code and do homework. <br><br>  Following all these considerations, I made a platform that covers all these needs. <br><br>  <b>1.</b> On it the information is broken by small theoretical blocks. <br><br>  <b>2.</b> The theory is immediately fixed by practical tests, in which in order to correctly answer a question, it is necessary to write code.  That is, you studied the tag &lt;b&gt;, please try to make a few words bold. <br><br>  <b>3.</b> Homework.  This is the key point.  In the process of learning, tasks are given that allow ‚Äúin battle‚Äù to consolidate the knowledge gained.  Moreover, these homework are checked by a real person and if the student is mistaken, he will be corrected and sent in the right direction. <br><br>  <b>4.</b> Practice.  Few people teach layout.  He needs to practice.  Therefore, there are many layouts on the site that can be imaged to consolidate the experience.  At the same time, the teacher will review your layout and say what you did correctly and what did not. <br><br>  <b>5.</b> Gamification.  In the process of learning a student earns points for which he can pump his character. <br><br>  But in this situation, the motivation of a person to reach the end decreases.  Anyway, there must be some human factor.  That is, there must be a teacher who will give kicks, personally announce homework and answer questions. <br><br><h3>  As I see now perfect learning now. </h3><br>  There are two components: a teacher and an online platform. <br><br>  The teacher performs the role of a mentor, a motivator.  He makes people study, checks homework, answers questions. <br><br>  The online platform allows you to gain knowledge.  On it, a person studies materials, establishes theory with practice, gets homework. <br><br>  As a result, the students study the material on their own at home, and at the lecture they discuss with the teacher the material they have been given, get answers to questions and just talk about life) Notice, I mean, this is group training. <br><br>  <b>PS</b> This is just the beginning.  Ahead there will be many more experiments, analyzes and development of the training system. <br><br>  <b>End point:</b> 10 out of 10 trained students who can enter the market and start making money from their own knowledge.  I hope that I will succeed. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/315112/">https://habr.com/ru/post/315112/</a></p>
