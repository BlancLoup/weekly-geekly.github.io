Everything is very bad."></a> <br><br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/455/b95/027/455b95027af4970f9898ccaae94897d4.jpg" alt="Yahoo.com website on a damaged laptop screen ASUS M3000. Half of the information is not read!"></a> <br><br>  In principle, the laptop is quite old and could be replaced entirely, but now they do not make laptops with 4x3 screens, and even in lightweight and durable metal-graphite cases.  Therefore, it was decided to look for a replacement screen. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Running through the sites that sell spare parts, I realized that the laptop screens of the old sample - this is a big shortage!  Found only 2 places where they sold the screens 1024x768 with a diagonal of 14.1 inches.  Not only was the price 2-3 times more than on similar widescreen screens, compatibility with the ASUS M3 series laptop was not 100% guaranteed. <br><br>  Without hesitation, I went to <a href="http://www.ebay.com/">eBay.com</a> and found a 2 used laptop.  One in working condition, at auction from $ 150 and one dismantled, but with a working screen, in the usual sale for $ 55.  I unfortunately lost the auction, so I had to take an "incomplete". <br><br>  Delivery to a friend in America cost $ 25, and he sent me to Kiev for $ 42.  That is, for $ 122 I got a full set of spare parts for a laptop <strong>ASUS M3</strong> .  Only the hard drive, CD / DVD drive and Wi-Fi card were missing.  Everything else is there, even the battery is working.  Not bad, considering that one LCD panel costs at least $ 120, without delivery. <br><br>  Here is what I received in the mail: <br><br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/fe7/c6f/417/fe7c6f417f964cab7d7f453d8dd11713.jpg" alt="Disassembled ASUS M3000N laptop purchased on EBay.com and sent by regular mail.

The keyboard is still exactly useful. And there was a completely working battery."></a> <br><br>  Surprisingly, the outside of the laptop was not black, but silver.  I have not even seen such.  Slowly began to disassemble the laptop: <br><br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/299/84d/65a/29984d65a6d77ef0654edb8b680bac72.jpg" alt="Remove the hinge caps and see which screws you need to unscrew to remove the laptop cover"></a> <br><br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/a6c/022/21a/a6c02221a4ef447e1e838e255c35e0ae.jpg" alt="It can be seen that the second loop has already been repaired, since one screw is broken, and the second is clearly not from here."></a> <br><br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/479/b72/fc0/479b72fc028f19a5f91241679b98b278.jpg" alt="Unscrew the 6 screws and get the lid of the laptop ASUS M3 assembly, already separate from the case"></a> <br><br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/354/ad2/bbb/354ad2bbb7fc1972f3fe278e536cbb5a.jpg" alt="You can simply rearrange the cover with the screen to another laptop, but it does not match the color and is heavily scratched"></a> <br><br>  When I bought a donor laptop, I thought that it would be enough to transfer the lid of the laptop assembly.  But there is another case: the color does not match, and the cover is scratched decently.  So it was decided to disassemble to the end :) <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/6db/699/b2b/6db699b2b9f167b07fcae376d12e7a8d.gif" alt="We take out the rubber caps of the screws to remove the frame of the laptop screen"><br><br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/c3d/703/0aa/c3d7030aa2cd0ccdb7a6074d93065c13.jpg" alt="Unscrew the 4 screws and gently snap off the screen frame around the perimeter"></a> <br><br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/73a/986/ace/73a986ace2af7d89111adb4ccba68260.jpg" alt="Our goal is close, it remains to unscrew only 4 screws to extract the screen of the laptop ASUS M3N"></a> <br><br>  As a result of simple operations, using a screwdriver, got a "bare" LCD panel for replacement. <br><br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/8c3/d3c/a36/8c3d3ca36bd18c15e6ffcd87985eb8ab.jpg" alt="Screen panel, extracted from ASUS M3 laptop.

Then I decided to work at the table, as it is necessary to do everything carefully and not to lose various small parts, screws, caps, etc. <br><br>  Notebook disassembly is another Quest game.  Every laptop maker is "perverted" as soon as it can.  That screws will hide in inaccessible places, for example under the keyboard.  That cunning latch will apply, which is simply not realistic to find.  Then in general, everything will be planted on glue, because the repair is not provided :) <br><br>  In the laptop <b>ASUS M3,</b> too, there is such a secret - this is the top panel with the power button!  To remove this part, you must first pry off the cover in the area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe Esc and F1 buttons with a screwdriver. <br><br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/712/c38/314/712c383147683aeb9d8e26350f91b087.jpg" alt="We disassemble the laptop ASUS M3. We pry the top cover with a screwdriver, in the area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe F1 button there is a special notch."></a> <br><br>  And then, with effort, move the entire panel to the left, so that it is free from the latches. <br><br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/d2d/d92/4d7/d2dd924d75b01f66c60e60a0721dbb37.jpg" alt="Repair laptop ASUS M3000. For disassembly, the top cover moves to the left."></a> <br><br>  So what do you think?  I once had an hour to solve this problem :) <br><br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/872/745/6f8/8727456f88e22b3c0ca615eed99803c2.jpg" alt="ASUS laptop. The top cover is removed cleverly: it is necessary to raise a screwdriver near the Esc button, and then move the cover to the left."></a> <br><br>  The screen frame in the <strong>ASUS M3Np</strong> laptop is fixed with 4 screws under the rubber caps.  The two top covers are convex, they are shock absorbers for the closure, so removing them is easy.  But the lower caps are made flush, to take them out you need a thin and sharp object.  I used a needle from a syringe. <br><br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/669/cbb/40a/669cbb40ab4e8e466029fa9f3f9d7e93.jpg" alt="We take out the decorative caps of the screws, a needle from a syringe is very suitable for this."></a> <br><br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/628/0ba/1d3/6280ba1d3b91d60bcefc80ddb4994904.jpg" alt="We unscrew 4 screws of fastening of a frame of the screen of the laptop ASUS M3"></a> <br><br>  Also, the screen frame is held by a variety of latches-locks.  It is necessary to pry the edge with a flat screwdriver and gradually loosen all latches along the entire perimeter.  The frame is rather ‚Äútender‚Äù, so you don‚Äôt need to hurry, otherwise you can easily break it. <br><br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/c16/049/2fb/c160492fb4dd6691cd91b257a7d92ff9.jpg" alt="We hook the frame with a screwdriver and gently release it from the latches around the perimeter"></a> <br><br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/d67/db7/05c/d67db705cfeed012ec97460a7f1d7176.jpg" alt="Remove the screen frame in a laptop Asus M3000"></a> <br><br>  When the frame is removed, then remove the screen panel is very simple.  It is necessary to disconnect the connectors from the motherboard and from the backlight lamp inverter (the board is directly under the screen). <br><br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/2ee/872/658/2ee872658ae587fd92405e0e390ca121.jpg" alt="Now we have full access to dismantle the broken LCD screen panel in the ASUS M-3 laptop"></a> <br><br>  And then unscrew the 4 screws in the corners, and carefully remove the screen panel towards you. <br><br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/961/272/2b5/9612722b54c507941b8e0fd0e8e09a95.jpg" alt="We unscrew the 4 screws, pull out the connectors from the motherboard and remove the faulty laptop screen panel"></a> <br><br>  We bring the "new" screen, extracted from the donor laptop, and compare its connectors and labeling with the "native".  Screen panels are made in different countries (one in Korea is different in the Philippines), but the dimensions and connectors are absolutely identical.  I also compared the markings of the backlight lamp inverters - they are the same.  If the boards are different, the screen must be rearranged along with the inverter. <br><br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/f46/96f/cc9/f4696fcc9e2dc8b805442839f1141f52.jpg" alt="Laptop ASUS-M3 and two LCD screens. &amp; quot; Old &amp; quot; cracked and &amp; quot; new &amp; quot; extracted from donor laptop"></a> <br><br>  Install the new screen and connect all the connectors.  At this point, the laptop is desirable to turn on and check the performance of all elements.  And then you never know, it will not be very interesting to disassemble the new one :) <br><br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/c67/ef8/6d9/c67ef86d9fcea9c3f70af13ef383b6ee.jpg" alt="Install a new laptop screen and check its performance. It seems to be fine."></a> <br><br>  It seems that everything works, so we finally collect the laptop.  We try not to leave "extra details" :) <br><br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/d1c/f82/d77/d1cf82d779f04b6de960c15f9a8df45e.jpg" alt="We set the screen frame into place and completely assemble the ASUS laptop. Repair is over!"></a> <br><br>  Repair is over, everyone is happy.  You can wash :) <br><br>  So it's not such a difficult task <a href="http://delaem.blogspot.com/2009/04/blog-post.html">to replace the screen in a</a> <b>ASUS M-3</b> <a href="http://delaem.blogspot.com/2009/04/blog-post.html">laptop</a> .
