Many will get their deodorant and socks, but not everyone wants such a gift, right?  No, deodorant with socks is not bad at all, but sometimes you want a <s>shower gel</s> or something more original. <br><br>  We in Dadget, on reflection, decided to make our own selection of gifts that would be nice to get a geek.  Not necessarily on the 23rd of February, the selection can be called universal.  Of course, it is subjective, but we hope that with its help it is possible to reduce the flour of choice. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h3>  Withings Smart Body Analyzer WS-50 </h3><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/e3a/918/3e3/e3a9183e349b714517b0c81050dc372f.jpg" width="750">

      At first glance, it is scales.  And in fact, this device can measure the user's weight without problems.  But the device can do much more than just weigh. <br><br>  It can determine the ratio of fat and water in the human body.  In addition, he knows how to count the pulse.  Determine the scales and the amount of carbon dioxide from the ambient temperature. <br><br>  The collected data scales are transferred wirelessly (Wi-Fi and Bluetooth) to the user's mobile device.  Both Android and iOS are supported.  In general, these are no longer scales, but indeed, a whole analyzer of your body and the microclimate of the rooms in which we live. <br><br><h3>  Sounder iBobber </h3><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/b10/2d3/a1d/b102d3a1d7954d93889134d365ffc705.jpg" width="750"><br><br>  A big fish or a big catch of smaller fish is the dream of many fishermen.  In order to achieve this dream, the fisherman needs knowledge and experience.  Although even they do not guarantee getting what you want.  Well, if fishing trips happen often, then a day without a catch will not be a tragedy.  Well, if you can leave once a month, and even less? <br><br>  In this case, you can help yourself by using a modern device, iBobber echo sounder.  It allows you to find out if there is a fish in the chosen place, determine the depth and perform several other tasks.  The depth of the device is about 45 meters, the diameter of the coating is up to 75 meters.  The angle of coverage is 42 degrees. <br><br>  The device is quite practical, difficulties in its use should arise.  It is equipped with LEDs that allows you to fish at dusk or even in complete darkness.  The echo sounder software helps you plan your fishing taking into account the forecast of temperature, pressure and precipitation.  Plus, the calendar has the time of sunrise, sunset, moon phases, tide table.  The echo sounder is suitable for use in winter and summer, read more about its capabilities <a href="https://geektimes.ru/company/dadget/blog/285336/">here</a> . <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/07c/e33/71c/07ce3371cbcc4602a94cbaf69f4f19f6.jpg" width="750"><br><br>  Well <a href="https://dadget.ru/katalog/zdorove/bluetooth-eholot-dlja-smartphone-ibobber/%3Futm_referrer%3Dgeektimes.ru%26utm_source%3Dgeektimes.ru%26utm_medium%3Darticle%26utm_term%3Dbluetooth-eholot-dlja-smartphone-ibobber%26utm_content%3Dbluetooth-eholot-dlja-smartphone-ibobber%26utm_campaign%3Dbluetooth-eholot-dlja-smartphone-ibobber_550">, we</a> have the <a href="https://dadget.ru/katalog/zdorove/bluetooth-eholot-dlja-smartphone-ibobber/%3Futm_referrer%3Dgeektimes.ru%26utm_source%3Dgeektimes.ru%26utm_medium%3Darticle%26utm_term%3Dbluetooth-eholot-dlja-smartphone-ibobber%26utm_content%3Dbluetooth-eholot-dlja-smartphone-ibobber%26utm_campaign%3Dbluetooth-eholot-dlja-smartphone-ibobber_550">opportunity</a> to purchase it in Russia. <br><br><h3>  Tesla: a self-charging electric lighter that works everywhere </h3><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/349/9fe/0f3/3499fe0f394b11400871b9cfdd3b7391.jpg" width="750"><br><br>  According to the developers, the system is a combination of electromagnetic induction and an electric arc in an aluminum-magnesium package.  As mentioned above, all that needs to be done is to shake the lighter before use. <br><br>  The system produces electricity when a neodymium magnet moves with a diametrical magnetization in a spiral.  A single shake generates a charge that is sufficient for the operation of an electric arc for a duration of 3 seconds. <br><br>  The aluminum-magnesium body of the lighter is impact resistant and does not corrode over time.  Well, and the rubber inserts protect the inside of the lighter from water and dust (IP55w). <br><br>  What can I use <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/878602552/tesla-self-rechargeable-electronic-lighter">this lighter for</a> ?  For a trivial cigarette lighting.  In addition, you can set fire to paper - it is very useful for those people who have to make fires.  Incendiary mixture is not always there, matches or ordinary lighters also tend to run out or deplete their life.  And here is an almost eternal device that is not afraid of water, dust, or shock.  Yes, and external power he does not need. <br><br><h3>  Thermal imager Seek Thermal XR </h3><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/556/11d/142/55611d142629915894facc3b3ed2ded7.jpg" width="750"><br>  Another interesting device is a thermal imager that allows you to see the heat and cold.  It is enough to connect it to a smartphone or tablet, after which it will be possible to monitor, for example, heat leakage from a house or a heat pipe.  In the summer, similarly, you can follow where the flow of cold air, which generates air conditioning. <br><br>  Such a device can be used at home, in the office, at work - anywhere.  Among other uses of the imager is the definition of poor contact or short circuit in the electrical network.  Increased heating of mechanical systems will help identify problem areas - for example, areas without lubrication or worn bearings. <br><br>  The thermal imager is also useful for the hunter, since the device helps to see a warm-blooded animal at a distance of up to 300 meters. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/vzzGdowXYdA" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br>  Seek Thermal can only work with Android smartphones that support USB-OTG.  You can check support by connecting a microUSB USB flash drive to your smartphone or a regular USB flash drive, mouse or keyboard via a MicroUSB-USB OTG adapter.

Yes, a lot.  Here are just a little bit of possible uses when the thermometer helps to determine: <br><br>  - The temperature of the bath and food for the baby <br>  - Ideal conditions for brewing tea or drinking wine <br>  - Temperature of products freezing <br>  - The quality of the heating <br>  - Heating elements and soldering iron when soldering <br>  - The temperature of technical equipment, engine in the car <br>  - The temperature of the extruder and desktop 3D printer <br><br>  The receiver of the infrared range is made with a lens with a window in the middle for the measurement.  Laser pointer to determine the location of the measurement is missing.  The device is a household, not a professional thermometer. For a more accurate measurement, it is advised to change the distance to the minimum to the object. <br><br>  You <a href="https://geektimes.ru/company/dadget/blog/275564/">can</a> read the test results <a href="https://geektimes.ru/company/dadget/blog/275564/">here</a> and <a href="https://geektimes.ru/company/dadget/blog/252018/">here</a> , and order it <a href="https://dadget.ru/katalog/dom-i-dacha/infrared-thermometer/%3Futm_referrer%3Dgeektimes.ru%26utm_source%3Dgeektimes.ru%26utm_medium%3Darticle%26utm_term%3Dthermometer2%26utm_content%3Dthermometer2%26utm_campaign%3Dthermometer2_550">here</a> . <br><br><h3>  Smart lamp "Samosvet Mini" </h3><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/ba6/4c0/86d/ba64c086d70a438fa7e3e765fa408ada.jpg" width="750"><br><br>  This is a small self-contained luminaire that is equipped with both motion and light sensors.  It works on batteries.  Install it stands where the light is needed, but do not want to constantly turn it on or off.  You know how it happens - turned on the light bulb, forgot about it, leaving the room and remembered a day later.  Accordingly, the level of energy consumption of an office or apartment rises, and you have to pay more. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/0f3/81b/afe/0f381bafe94c40fca294e895ddcbb3e0.jpg" width="750"><br><br>  By the way, ‚ÄúSamosvet Mini‚Äù does not turn on during the day and does not consume its batteries.

And if it is also a convenient suitcase, then the journey will be a sheer pleasure without unpleasant trifles.  Marlon - a suitcase with a large capacity, strong frame, practical and replaceable wheels, a battery for recharging the device owner and the ability to pack their own.  The handle and other mechanical parts of the suitcase are assembled so as to last as long as possible. <br><br>  One of the useful features of this suitcase is help in packing things.  With the help of a special system of levers, it can compress the contents. <br><br>  The case comes with a built-in removable battery with a capacity of 10400 mAh.  During the trip, gadgets are discharged - this is the law.  And as soon as this happened, the device can be charged.  The battery is fixed in a special pocket, so that it can be removed if necessary (for example, when passing control). <br><br>  He himself is waterproof, handles and wheels - especially durable.  The developers who presented their system on Kickstarter, tried their best. <br><br><h3>  Car alarm "Autophone Alfa-Beacon" </h3><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/02d/6f8/34a/02d6f834a2fa495ba59db548fe517162.jpg" width="750"><br>  <i>The device is small, but it can be very much</i> <br><br>  If you, or the person you want to congratulate, have a car, then it's time to think about purchasing such a gadget like Autophone Alfa-Beacon.

So, by calling the hotline number and informing the number of the application to the ATS about the theft of the car, the operators take over all the work of managing and searching for the beacon, and also transmit the data from it to the police through official channels. <br><br>  With the help of a car beacon, you can track a lost four-legged friend or even an elderly relative, a person who already finds it difficult to navigate the terrain.
