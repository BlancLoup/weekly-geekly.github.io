With the rules, of course.  And for whom are these very rules invented and written?  For people, of course.  All this seems to be natural, but in practice all this is in most cases not natural or, sorry, supernatural, or, more precisely, unnatural. <br><br>  A lot of rules are written in official language and with such an incredibly large number of letters that it is almost impossible to master this ‚Äúmost pleasant‚Äù reading.  Why are there unreal, let's be honest with ourselves - reluctant, disgusting, lazy, disgusting, galimo ... hold me, go to the mat because I‚Äôm going now ... <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  The events in our case developed according to the following scenario: we also ‚Äúrushed into the official area‚Äù, but somehow we got bored in 63 (sixty-third) paragraphs, and the focus group, it was documented, did not get beyond 21 (twenty-first) paragraphs, He began to ‚Äúnod‚Äù his nose, who closed the page with the rules ... And then, we thought, what's better is less, yes is better :)

      That's what happened in the end.  But before I publish the rules, I will note a very interesting fact.  <strong>We have already received thanks for our rules.</strong>  <strong>People literally wrote the following: ‚ÄúI read the rules for the first time to the end,‚Äù ‚Äúreal rules written for people,‚Äù ‚Äúbriefly and on the topic</strong> . <strong>‚Äù</strong>  It is worth a lot!  This is a confirmation that it is always necessary to treat people as people, and not as a brainless cattle (slightly bent, but I think everyone caught the point) ... <br><br>  So, the rules themselves: <br><br>  We have everything, like normal and decent people.  There are few rules and all of them are aimed at making the use of the Owner ( <a href="http://www.vladelia.ru/">www.vladelia.ru</a> ) a convenient, useful and valuable occupation for all owners, as well as protecting the honor and dignity of community members: <br><br>  1. The most basic rule: <strong>Treat the rest of the owners community the way you would like them to treat you</strong> .  This means that each registered user is obliged to respect the opinions of other participants, not to become personal, not to swear, not to engage in public relations and not to try to seem smarter than everyone else;) <br>  2. Access to information is possible only for registered users. <br>  3. Each registered user decides for himself what information about himself is available for viewing by other users. <br>  4. It is impossible to view all the possessions of a single person. <br>  5. Respect someone else's time, write intelligible notes (not just monosyllabic "cool", "bad", "nonsense", "so-so", but also with the addition of reasonable information, that is, useful for others, information) on your domain . <br>  6. The user undertakes not to post on the Owner information that is contrary to the law or the rules of international law. <br><br>  If these rules are not followed, the violator will be warned, and if such violations are repeated, they will be removed from the Owner without warning. <br><br>  Our goal is to unite the owners of reasonable people into the community, and the cranks with the letter ‚Äúm‚Äù go to all four sides! <br><br>  Good luck, health and prosperity to all owners! <br><br>  - Only 205 (!!!) words.  And no water!  Taking this opportunity, I want to thank Vladimir Yashnikov (the author of InternetShtuchek) for the proposal to add item 6 to the rules of the Owner. Reasonable advice! <br><br>  Everything!  Thank you for attention. <br><br>  <strong>Update:</strong> We gratefully accept all feedback from Habra users and respond to constructive criticism.  We want to thank <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/users/art_of_press/" class="user_link">art_of_press</a> for pointing out the discrepancy between the title of our publication and its content.  Correct. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/20904/">https://habr.com/ru/post/20904/</a></p>
