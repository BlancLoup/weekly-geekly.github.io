The same with flights from Amsterdam.  Oddly enough, Swedish airlines also fly on an inhuman schedule.  And only from flights from a star-striped country, people go out even if they are sleeping, but not because they took the plane for a 12-hour flight at 3 o'clock in the morning (they don‚Äôt do that), but because those who somehow flies to Russia because of the Atlantic, stocks pills of sleeping pills and sleeps peacefully throughout the entire flight.

      True, our speakers cannot be referred to as wimps: after arriving in the first half of the day, no one went to bed before a full conference day (at that moment I sometimes feel like an educator in a certain group), but on the contrary, everyone was full of energy to explore a little city, see what's going on around.  Fortunately, the weather was really wonderful and the sun, hitting the window panels, poured on the asphalt wherever possible.  Phil did not fail to capture it on your Instagram. <br><br>  The last to arrive was Robert Niemann from Mozilla, who said right away that he had brought a hockey stick with him and would take revenge, and in my comment on the phone about ‚Äúthe car that drives us‚Äù he noted that in one of the world languages ‚Äã‚Äã‚Äúmachine‚Äù many - no less, all known machine gun.  Then I realized that I was waiting ahead, but on Friday it became obvious that this concerns all of us.  Meanwhile, Robert did not stop his stinging jokes ("I'm joking with respect") and sharp comments almost for a minute.  Therefore, at the end of this post, we prepared for him a special surprise - that Moscow, the toaster and our cheerful company would forever be deposited in his heart. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/a83/61a/bd2/a8361abd2101ff251963c91fadc6ebfd.jpg"><br><br>  We have already talked <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/toster/">about all the speakers</a> separately, so this time we will focus on them, as a whole, together with the audience, partners and afterparty, which has surprisingly harmoniously ended the day of acquaintances, new knowledge, understanding and, I can only guess what else. <br><br>  As you can see, this time there were no problems with either coffee or toast.  I want to believe that everyone was satisfied, because the stomachs - the most subtle and difficult place for everyone, especially when it comes to developers.  The guys gladly made sweet toasts before registration began and people poured into the hall. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/636/3b5/69e/6363b569ec1cc10faa40a5122d78b255.jpg"><br><br>  Special thanks to the beautiful girls who helped us with registering participants and everything else that required women's attention. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/f8d/b05/c95/f8db05c955b441f5cdede524ce193c2f.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/49c/a27/0e1/49ca270e11a54461b6afc24fadbf0474.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/9e6/013/203/9e6013203ba11920944844ccd5241437.jpg"><br><br>  Finally, it struck 10 hours.  Nearly choking on their toes, our dear ones remembered that it would be nice to test the compatibility of all the equipment before starting the enchanting show.  However, no one had any problems.  By the time we finished, we found ourselves standing on the stage in front of an already, in fact, full hall.  Ralph said weighty American ‚ÄúWow!‚Äù, Phil slowly backed away from the center of gravity towards the chair, Robert finished writing the last lines of code in his slides, and Jan ... well, Jan was getting ready to go and say what he had to. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/a14/ee6/059/a14ee6059f44529c776fda042c130f6a.jpg"><br><br>  Sometimes it seems to me that it is impossible to change the Dutch.  In principle, all the other guests agreed with this and the thing is this: Yang flew in one shirt, bringing a laptop with him, exercises for him, a light jacket and, apparently, everything.  On all days, as soon as we went to a museum or some other place of general interest, Yang, with undisguised pleasure, called us "retirees" and said that "real" rest should be in a different format.  However, we also showed him this format at the end of Friday, and one cannot say that the young specialist from Cloud9 respected by us remained dissatisfied. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/135/5ac/f91/1355acf91e31a9966a405a83920fc361.jpg"><br><br>  Although initially Yang was the last in the program, he was encouraged by the possibility of a kind of opening of the conference with the first report.  At this time, Phil, Ralph and Robert were already very hard pounding their fingers on the keys, finishing writing something and adding something in the process of Jan‚Äôs speech. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/483/b5b/8d4/483b5b8d443c83d9f9b5ba8b4f0c533d.jpg"><br><br>  Phil immediately noted the quality of the equipment at the site and was glad that the pictures were shown on the screens, and not from the projector.  Apparently, this calmed him a little and, although Phil often goes with speeches around the conference, no one really knew what to expect from the audience, but when he saw the audience‚Äôs reaction to Jan‚Äôs speeches (which was affectionate, but at the same time not joking, the guys called and called simple and concise "kid"), Phil was completely ready to go on stage.  With small pin microphones mounted on the collar, they looked more like participants in a humorous show, especially considering the amount of jokes from Robert.  Well, nothing, as I promised - we will win. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/95b/1de/765/95b1de76554e783a3e317001de7dd359.jpg"><br><br>  Since Phil works in a creative agency, and not in an exclusive development company, his report was more ‚Äúhumanitarian‚Äù, and the slides startled me.  However, I am sure that all our visitors liked this format, since javascript is still a front-end, and the front-end is inextricably linked with what we see when opening the web page with our eyes and Phil talked about this - the first the impression of how not to spoil it.  At least, it seemed to us that way, if anything - correct. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/9a5/657/b2d/9a5657b2d95a218726373562e9cee9db.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/54b/97c/88d/54b97c88de30c299dd6052fedfad8dca.jpg"><br><br>  At this time, Ralph was a little nervous about his report, and the audience was preparing to leave for the next break. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/007/e95/9fc/007e959fcf08179d42447368d8e8f946.jpg"><br><br>  Having slightly instructed Pasha Dovbush, the fourth speaker, we left to drink coffee and discuss further presentations, at the same time listening to the comments and wishes of the first speakers. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/f77/142/d1f/f77142d1f06c352bcde714a593a65364.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/424/7e5/368/4247e536838fedd2127880c41d4f23a8.jpg"><br><br>  Although Ralph had a lot of time to ‚Äúscold‚Äù for retelling AmplifyJS documentation, I think his report was interesting to many, as the person brought to talk about, in general, the knee design inside the company, which was not made to earn money, but for the community.  This is one of the reasons why the community should be pretty;) <br><br><img alt="I have an account on both Habr√© and Leprosy))" src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/15f/eb2/44e/15feb244e936f0c0248f67f1ea12a745.jpg"><br><br>  During the speech of Ralph, our first Russian-speaking speaker, Pavel Dovbush, from Badoo, was preparing to leave.  We met with Pasha a couple of days before the conference in order to communicate and he made an indelible impression on me about a professional and, even more important, a productive optimist.  Pasha grabbed literally everything on the fly, even if some things were not easy to understand from the first time, and as a result he came out on the scene and presented an interesting topic worthy of everyone‚Äôs attention. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/fad/853/485/fad853485523f5c343072dea34fd1ffe.jpg"><br><br>  By that time, when Pasha was already answering questions from the audience, I felt a certain tension on the side where Robert was sitting.  He finally finished rewriting his slides and smiled sweetly at me, which only added cause for concern, in the light of his special temper. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/35f/0aa/09c/35f0aa09c71d4b8aa58562a0c01f8d8a.jpg"><br><br>  I think that what Robert showed us has long remained in the mind of everyone who came.  First, not every day there is an opportunity to see and talk with a very experienced, intelligent and interesting person from Mozilla, who is engaged in evangelism of the whole platform (‚ÄúI went to the monastery as a child, I also pumped my biceps‚Äù). <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/344/7ae/92e/3447ae92ec82df953d9930d14877d4d4.jpg"><br><br>  In principle, there is nothing to add, and we will not show pictures of Robert, since we have only one such picture, which really deserves attention.  In addition, his slides will not undergo strict censorship of our resource :) If you were at the conference, review the speech recording, and if you didn‚Äôt, you can just look <a href="http://toster.ru/results">at the slides</a> , that will be enough. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/529/189/1df/5291891df3ccad4d25e07cd7d9d1e04b.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/136/685/de4/136685de48d4ca71c9ff752ee36d7793.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/4c8/9e0/7b0/4c89e07b077d2012ad399f1685383c31.jpg"><br><br>  And, in principle, it is not surprising that many people preferred to dinner the solution of the riddles of girls from SuperJob, who played three new iPads after dinner.  We can only be glad for the winners and wish ourselves that such girls with such gifts would come to our conference as often as possible;) <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/78f/ae8/a27/78fae8a27300a6a5da23941ef2de6de5.jpg"><br><br>  After lunch, Shavkat Ainurin from News360 talked about their creation of a web version of their own application.  Here I want to make a small remark to all who came: we know that you love foreign speakers, but this is not a reason for our compatriots with less attention or respect. <br><br>  If you doubt this, try to write any report and read it in front of people unknown to you, say, near the office, without causing even one of them to grin.  After that, write in the comments how long it will turn out to be done :) <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/048/02a/121/04802a121429549aff6981dc858d86a7.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/9fa/2de/27a/9fa2de27a103ec330e8f9789ea156291.jpg"><br><br>  Kostya Kichinsky from Microsoft came on the scene a little bit earlier, as we experienced some difficulties in establishing communication with the Canadian Blackberry office, where employees use personalized laptops around the world that provide virtually no external access to devices or information ‚Äî partly because of this. we had to use Skype to hear Adam, a little later. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/79e/a43/f20/79ea43f20b25daf4a92ab37a1f5e2702.jpg"><br><br>  However, Kostya did not waste time in vain and, by the sensations, his performance was perceived by the majority very positively.  Probably he put something in the posters, which he scattered around the room with such zeal. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/95d/eb4/562/95deb4562b84370359dd17832bd7a95a.jpg"><br><br>  Finally, it's time for our remote speeches.  It‚Äôs a pity that we didn‚Äôt manage to bring these two people to Moscow in the end - the Blackberry management changed the speaker to a higher level at the last moment, and Joe was denied a visa three times in a row in the absence of any objective reasons. <br><br>  However, we are pleased that as a result of the speech, it was still a success.  Next time we will write out the speakers by diplomatic mail. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/eb1/5d4/e81/eb15d4e81ad8f6a61eb1aefd59bfeffc.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/8dd/b31/8b7/8ddb318b7be6f33edad387c0f8940801.jpg"><br><br>  Finally, after the main program of the event was completed, we played small prizes in the form of Yota 4G modems, although in reality everyone was waiting for only one thing - when, finally, the doors of the bar and the Badoo company (with which we bring huge thanks for organizing such afterparty for all) finally let us go on your holiday of life. <br><br>  Finally - it happened. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/36e/9c8/0f4/36e9c80f43497bbac86ab62ca489c905.jpg"><br><br>  Even we, until the very last moment, did not even guess what Badoo was organizing, but the result exceeded any expectations! <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/13a/a0f/7c1/13aa0f7c1c0d75a15af7ba576b314f5a.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/140/fdb/f02/140fdbf02eb1f01c48708b8ae954de56.jpg"><br><br>  And moonshine, and chess, games, hookah corner - here were all the conditions to melt the hearts of IT people, tormented by many hours of the conference program.  Having a little embarrassed and trampling on the spot, everyone finally dispersed to where the real party began. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/967/76b/a72/96776ba726ad9b41ef0fc56d61797398.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/4dc/806/e9b/4dc806e9b7103f64c6b1cef651da185c.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/51c/7bd/68e/51c7bd68e9b94ba1d6f08eb74aa7488b.jpg"><br><br>  Thanks also to you, habrareyd and conference participants.  Your opinions allow us to remain one of the most interesting events for IT people in Moscow, we will try to only get better! <br><br>  PS Finally, what we all waited from the very beginning. <br><br><img src="http://ralphwhitbeck.com/i/rw6f86b3.png" alt="image"><br><br>  Come again! </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/145506/">https://habr.com/ru/post/145506/</a></p>
