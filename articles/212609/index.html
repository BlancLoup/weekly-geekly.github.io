Or rather, about one of the representatives of this class of printers - model Ricoh Aficio SP C430DN.  The review of this very popular device from a Japanese manufacturer, which is already being produced not for the first generation, is under the screen. <a name="habracut"></a><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/763/959/bcd/763959bcd6879a52cbac8ed9bec5f015.jpg">

      Already at first glance, the device becomes obvious that this model is clearly not intended for home use, but is an enterprise-class solution for entire work groups. <br><br>  A high-speed printer capable of handling large volumes of documents also allows you to print high-quality images.  The model has a fairly wide range of applications, but is most often used in marketing departments that print handouts for the company, copy centers, and even printing houses.  But the use of Ricoh SP C430DN in small and medium-sized offices with the main task of printing monochrome documents is not very advisable, since the capabilities of the device are much wider (although, of course, you can't forbid living beautifully).  In addition, the weight (57 kg) and dimensions of the model require quite a lot of space and a separate table for its installation. <br><br>  The printer‚Äôs communications capabilities are fairly typical of a device designed for office use.  The back panel contains standard Ethernet and USB 2.0 connectors for interfacing with the network environment.  A wireless module is not provided, but can be purchased and installed separately (although the appropriateness of such a step is rather dubious). <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/20d/f42/b57/20df42b57d172189631899f9d780eb08.jpg"><br><br>  The top cover of the device is easily opened, giving the user access to the powder tubes (there are four of them), which can be easily replaced if necessary.  It‚Äôs easy to open the front of the printer, which you will have to do to remove and replace the cartridge. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/426/772/7bd/4267727bdd0328dd7f39d78c69e1cc35.jpg"><br><br>  In general, it should be noted that all the details of the printer, which is accessible to the average user, are marked with green markers.  Next to these elements are stickers that explain in detail what, how and in what sequence to do.  So basic maintenance, such as replacing a cartridge or toner, can easily be done by an unprepared user even without reading the instructions. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/c53/558/d62/c53558d62794b4b08a8d5d3644d05291.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/2b0/e3f/0f8/2b0e3f0f8141fd48671a868d878a8c24.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/464/eba/2ce/464eba2ce21995cf6ef9722174fbf162.jpg"><br><br>  The front panel of the device has an LCD display, with which you can not only manage print jobs, but also access some of the print profile settings (a full list of these settings is available through the PostScript driver, which we will discuss later). <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/2bf/2b5/5c9/2bf2b55c9288a9dee8c1395ac693e632.jpg"><br><br>  The printing speed of the printer Aficio SP C430DN is 35 pages per minute.  It does not matter if the text or images are printed, black and white or color document - the speed remains constant.  The print quality is quite high; when printing graphic files, you can select a good color rendition and contrast of images, which allows you to use the model as a photo printer if you have special paper. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/17b/94b/f0e/17b94bf0eeeb2b0f16f0dbd4b7f1e1a4.jpg"><br><br>  Speaking of paper.  The powerful mechanics of the printer allows you to print on very thick paper - up to 300 g / m2 with a special metallized surface.  Good toner baking allows printing on paper with a textured surface.  In general, a set of media on which this model can print is quite large - envelopes, postcards, special films and much more. <br><br>  By the way, an interesting feature is that Aficio SP C430DN was developed for completely different markets (the language set of the model includes 14 languages), as a result of which it supports absolutely non-standard paper formats common in non-European regions - for example, rice paper for printing hieroglyphs, whose length is about 50 cm. In addition, some printer components can be replaced with specialized modules even from another manufacturer, which will allow printing, for example, on ceramics. <br><br>  The standard volume of a color cartridge is rather solid and makes 24 000 prints.  The cartridges themselves are quite expensive, but due to the volume, the cost of printing is, as a result, rather low - for a color print, it is estimated to be up to 70 kopecks.  It is worth noting that the cartridges are not chip-fed, so you can refill them yourself - they are ordinary tubes with powder and it is quite simple to do this. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/61b/6ff/e63/61b6ffe63c352ad22f31d5c74672e960.jpg"><br><br>  However, in this case there is a possibility that the quality of prints may deteriorate. <br>  As for the resource Aficio SP C430DN, the recommended peak load model is 20,000 copies per month.  The total declared resource of the printer is about 1.2 million prints, which, when operating at peak loads, guarantees at least 5 years of operation of the device. <br><br>  One of the highlights of the model is the support of page description languages ‚Äã‚Äã- PCL and PostScript.  The first is designed primarily for printing text, and the second for images.  While the settings of both drivers are almost identical when working with office documents and PDF files, while working with professional graphic editors and publishing systems, PostScript provides a much wider range of settings and features. <br><br>  This is how the print settings using PostScript driver for standard office tasks look like: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/695/526/7d1/6955267d12779b45d1f2481a8954421a.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/c4b/76e/135/c4b76e135f0d7b8c3d92b6d3cefaac68.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/042/e0d/60a/042e0d60a30ab0dd7bde6b9a6e2a819a.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/d41/4a7/10f/d414a710fbb56e5b92d92125e375a37c.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/07b/de8/dd5/07bde8dd563b05e4974e01951344920e.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/63d/ae0/c1f/63dae0c1fc39fa9878140b9dad601373.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/49e/efe/36b/49eefe36bfc2358a0a0635b47b132865.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/95c/4d1/f53/95c4d1f53d2b253d51c4e7bcb660e39f.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/68d/19f/fb0/68d19ffb0b8003cbbffcf700bbbfd4f8.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/703/217/967/703217967148a93bfd9b0b0593cd2ae0.jpg"><br><br>  Personal feeling is impressive.  When buying, it is advisable to call for the installation of a service specialist who will help with the settings. <br>  The device is made soundly, and the weight of 57 kg as for the A4 device says that the nodes are not plastic, and the resource with 1 200 000 prints is declared to work. <br><br>  Ready to recommend to a friend. <br><br><hr><br>  <a href="http://www.service.muk.ua/">MUK-Service - all types of IT repair: warranty, non-warranty repair, sale of spare parts, contract service</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/212609/">https://habr.com/ru/post/212609/</a></p>
