    <h2>  In the plans: </h2><br><ul><li>  to withstand any load on the site; </li><li>  highlight the event as much as possible; </li><li>  chat in chat, "without departing from the box office." </li></ul><br>  The second news is even nicer, but, unfortunately, limited to Rostov-on-Don and its surroundings. <br><br>  <a href="http://www.imtime.ru/publication%3Fid%3D8847">Last time, the</a> Rostovites gathered at a Mac gathering on September 9 to share and discuss the Apple presentation.  <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/apple/69159/">Announcement on Habr√©</a> appeared on the day of the event, and <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/apple/69159/">it turned out for some</a> too late.  So, fulfilling the <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/apple/69159/">promise</a> , we invite everyone to the <a href="http://www.mactime.ru/contacts">M.Time office</a> on January 27 at 20:30. <br><br>  <b>What is expected</b> : a projector, fast Internet, cheerful company.  Those wishing to come, please check in the comments to this news. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h2>  Load </h2><br><ul><li>  Our application is based on the Google App Engine platform.  Holding past events allowed us to feel a decent load, so we optimized the application based on the ‚Äúworst‚Äù :) scenario. </li><li>  We keep photos of ourselves.  First, it is safer and faster.  If there are problems at the source sites, our visitors will not notice.  Secondly, so we will never lose them.  Our past events will always be available for viewing at the moment: <a href="http://live.mactime.ru/event%3Fid%3D1">WWDC 09</a> , <a href="http://live.mactime.ru/event%3Fid%3D2">09.09.09</a> .  Of course, this leads to additional overhead in the form of traffic and the number of requests.  So, during the broadcast on September 9, which gathered not so many viewers, there were 184 thousand requests for receiving images. </li><li>  New images and text messages are delivered to users not by full page overload (which is very inconvenient), but by extremely lightweight ajax requests, which occupy only a couple of hundred bytes.  The frequency of such updates - every 20 seconds.  So the latest news will come from the heat of the heat. </li></ul><br><br><h2>  Team </h2><br><ul><li>  The whole team is working on the broadcast.  September 9, we worked together.  You have no idea how fun it is. </li><li>  3-4 sources of information are monitored simultaneously. </li><li>  The engine allows everyone to work at the same time, so that updates are formed very quickly and in large quantities.  Some numbers.  <b>On September 9,</b> during an hour and a half broadcast, we had 238 messages, of which 138 were photos from the scene.  <b>wwdc 09</b> - 142 photos. </li></ul><br><br><h2>  Chat </h2><br><ul><li>  It was decided to ‚Äúdecorate‚Äù the last broadcast with a chat, so that users could express themselves and discuss what was happening.  Of course, we first looked for available solutions.  In fact, one requirement was presented - the ability to embed a widget in our page so that the chat was one with the broadcast.  Of the most suitable options, only the client from Meebo got used to it, but he had a couple of serious flaws that were haunted.  Firstly, there are periodic crashes from the chat and problems with connecting to the server.  Secondly, the limit on the number of participants in communication, which, apparently, is 80 people.  As a result, on the knee for a very limited time, we made our simple solution, devoid of these shortcomings. </li><li>  In our opinion, communication was very fun.  More than 2100 messages were left by 300 users.  The visitor of "wokenlex" asked to restore the log, and we promised him that.  Well, the time has come to fulfill a promise - the <a href="http://chat.mactime.ru/static/logs/09.09.09.html">history of correspondence</a> , with virtually no changes ( <b>Attention! In</b> some places obscene language). </li><li>  This time the chat will also be.  It has been significantly modified and refined (taking into account the wishes expressed by visitors).  At the same time, it remained as simple as before - no registration. </li><li>  Chat is also a GAE application, moreover, different from the application-broadcast.  This is done to reduce the load and meet the limits GAE, which can not be raised for money. </li></ul><br><br><h2>  Conclusion </h2><br><br>  The last time was a video broadcast Mac meetings.  Now we have not yet decided to organize something like this.  I would like to hear the opinion of those who watched last time, or those who want to look at this. <br><br>  <b>Update</b> <br><br>  PS In other cities, anyone planning to gather? <br><br><h3>  Similar meetings in other cities: </h3><br><ul><li>  <a href="http://www.onliner.by/news/25.01.2010/15.13/">Event in Minsk</a> </li></ul></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/81802/">https://habr.com/ru/post/81802/</a></p>
