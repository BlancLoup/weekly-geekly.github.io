It seems that the number of smart watches is growing exponentially.  We have already counted more than 50 hours (and this is with the exception of fitness trackers that can show time), which are already being sold or will be sold soon. <br><br> <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/madrobots/blog/209944/"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/98c/0b6/03a/98c0b603a1b74c02a902f0f02d9cdb07.png"></a> <br><br>  But are all watches equally useful?  What is the difference?  Now tell. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Based on the characteristics and prevalence of the clock, we first made a large-large table, and then according to this table, we placed the clock images in the form of a cloud, guided by 2 pairs of parameters: functional simplicity (the functionality is defined by both the stated / existing functions and applications under this platform ), and sports phone functions (of course, this is not quite the opposite, but I still have not found a watch that simultaneously has a GSM module and works as a fitness tracker). <br><a name="pic"></a><br> <a href="http://img-fotki.yandex.ru/get/5108/81947762.0/0_f08f8_3543d300_orig"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/98c/0b6/03a/98c0b603a1b74c02a902f0f02d9cdb07.png"></a> <br>  Full version of the image is available by clicking on it.

      I must say to avoid accusations in the style of "picture you garbage."  This picture was born in agony between ‚Äúshow exactly,‚Äù ‚Äúshow right,‚Äù ‚Äúmake it look like shit,‚Äù ‚Äúfit into the screen,‚Äù ‚Äúkeep it fine,‚Äù and other, often conflicting, demands in my brain.  So, it doesn‚Äôt pretend to accuracy and accuracy in any way, but is the most obvious way to express relations in the watch market, taking the functionality as the starting point.  If there is a criticism based on characteristics rather than sensations, and specific thoughts about what needs to be changed in the picture - write in a personal.  In the meantime, this picture remains the most understandable of all that I have seen. <br><br><h4>  In which direction do the clocks go? </h4><br>  If we take as a basis ordinary watches, then ‚Äúsmart‚Äù ones are obtained by adding the following functions and their combinations to them: <br><br><ol><li>  Ability to run third-party programs </li><li>  Telephone module </li><li>  Ability to display notifications from the phone </li><li>  Sensors to detect user activity </li></ol><br><br>  More than anything new from the developers did not work.  Go point by point: <br><br><h5>  Ability to run third-party programs <br></h5><h6>  Android </h6>  The easiest way to implement the first point is to build a clock on one of the platforms that support Android.  In this case, the clock receives a practically ‚Äúfree‚Äù user interface (although it is practically not sharpened for small screens ‚Äî both in resolution and physical size), and in the SDK for third-party developers. <br>  If you don‚Äôt crawl too much into the system, then even applications from the big brother will run and work tolerably well (by this term I mean not at all what was meant during the CCP. Then the big brother was a computer, and now for the clock the big brother - this is a phone).  This advantage, users of the clock (unless of course the developers have blocked the possibility of installation) immediately after launching them on sale immediately receive a bunch of programs, without waiting for the developers to write them. <br>  Calculators (though not very convenient, but still), readers (giving a device for cheating on the exam), functional hours (stopwatches, timers, alarm clocks in various variations), weather, mail, Internet, and so on, up to navigators and maps . <br>  But this approach automatically means that you need to use a high-resolution screen in the clock (at least 240x240, compare with Pebble 144x168), color support (although, theoretically, this is not necessary, and you can do with a monochrome display, in practice I don‚Äôt know these), and touch panel.  All this increases the cost of hours, which has a bad effect on sales. <br>  In addition, no matter how you optimize the system, a powerful processor and sleep system in Android still makes itself felt - it‚Äôs difficult to get a lot of work, usually it is limited to a maximum of 3 days with not very active use, and trying to do something active in hours I will drop the battery and at all for a couple of hours. <br>  Another of the negative factors of this approach is the presence of a screen that needs to be turned on even in order to see the time on it.  This means either pressing a button, or making an absolutely definite hand gesture (shaking or turning it sharply enough), which absolutely does not add to the convenience of a watch, a device designed to observe time. <br>  Although last year Qualcomm already showed Qualcomm Toq watches using a new type of screen that can show color and is active all the time, there are only a few ready projects with this type of screen on the market (Toq do not take into account, because they do not plan to sell them) Although, things can change, as in the case of Sony, who at one time also did not think to seriously sell their first hours). <br>  <b>In the picture:</b> Scattered evenly throughout the map, on Android, they make any type - from simple notification, to sports trackers and phone-hours. <br><br><h6>  Android Wear <br></h6>  Universal platform for smart watches, developed by Google.  Based on Android, albeit somewhat simplified and undemanding.  The minus of all the hours on Wear lies in their short working hours - the clock will have to be charged the same way as the phone - every day.  Even in the appendage we get a touchscreen interface and a color screen that does not work in standby mode - in order to display the clock, you will have to touch the screen.  Pros - universal interface for different models and native support for all watches on this platform in Android since version 4.3.  For example, <a href="http://hi-tech.mail.ru/review/LG_G_Watch-rev.html">here</a> you can read a good overview of the possibilities of Android Wear. <br><br><h6>  Own platform <br></h6>  Another way is to develop both the platform and the SDK itself.  The advantages of this approach are that you fully control both the hardware and software of the watch, and can optimize energy costs quite a lot.  For example, Pebble live with me for about 6-7 days with a permanent connection to the phone, and without connection - twice as long.  Not much, but not Samsung Gear with one day. <br>  This is achieved including the ability to put any type of screen with any resolution, and without a capacitive sensor. <br>  But on the other hand, developers are working to write and maintain both the firmware and the development kit.  I can only guess how much effort it is to write all the documentation with examples of code for developing a device, hardly much less effort to write the firmware itself. <br>  <b>In the picture:</b> Scattered evenly throughout the map. <br><br><h5>  Telephone module <br></h5> Although he is not only, and not how much the telephone - to speak on the clock is not how convenient that it becomes a replacement for the phone.  This is more of an online module, since Chinese Mediatek chipsets are now cheap. <br>  This is done mainly in order to get away from binding to the phone, to make the watch a separate, self-sufficient device that does not require a telephone with BT turned on 5 meters away. <br>  This is also quite interesting, the ability to leave the phone at home (for example, when leaving for a training session, where the phone is in the pocket), but at the same time to receive messages. <br>  Minuses?  Yes, there is. <br>  In this case, you will have to use Android, because there is no other alternative.  Of course, you can write your own OS, but it is quite expensive, long, users lose the opportunity to run ready-made programs, and in this case you can not wait for battery savings, constant communication with the network will still be guaranteed to finish the battery in a day. <br>  <b>On the picture:</b> Evenly on the left side of the picture. <br><br><h5>  Ability to display notifications from the phone <br></h5>  This functionality is most often associated with the concept of "smart watches", and as a rule, watches are bought for use in this form.  A notification comes to the phone, and is displayed on the clock - you do not need to get the phone out of your pocket, unlock it, and then put it back, just glance at your wrist. <br>  But how the clock implements this functionality is different for everyone.  Some work on the standard headset protocol, which is described in the BT standard itself.  Pluses - such watches will work with most phones, even non-smartphones.  Cons - they can only notify about the call, show the number and name of the caller (and only Latin characters).  About notifications about SMS, chat rooms, facebook, contacts, and so on will have to be forgotten.  I did not add watches with such functionality to the table and picture, because I do not consider them to be ‚Äúsmart watches‚Äù in the sense that they are now investing in this concept. <br>  A smarter watch requires having its application on the phone, which receives notifications from the programs on the phone, and why sends them to the clock. <br>  Here the quantity and quality of these notifications can vary quite dramatically.  Cogito Original (in Cookoo watch girlhood) shows only notification type icons (calendar, call, mail and so on), the older model from the same manufacturers - Cogito Pop also have a small screen. <br>  The Martian line of watches can do about the same, the user can only access a small one-line display. <br>  Finally, really ‚Äúsmart‚Äù watches receive most popular notifications (calendar, calls, SMS, mail, chat messages, social networks and so on) on the phone using their program, and transfer them to the watch.  For example, pebble using <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details%3Fid%3Deu.sesc.pebblify">Pebblify</a> or <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details%3Fid%3Dcom.dattasmoon.pebble.plugin%26hl%3Dru">Pebble Notifer</a> can show all notifications, up to system notifications, like ‚Äúsystem update available‚Äù <br><br>  <b>In the picture: The</b> upper part of the picture with rare exceptions (Leikr, Motorola MOTOACTV, Adidas miCoach Smart Run), and on the lower part of the vertical arrow (Cogito Pop, Cookoo watch, Casio G-Shock Bluetooth, Martian) <br><br><h5>  Sensors to detect user activity <br></h5>  Another application of smart watches is tracking user activity, working as a fitness tracker.  The simplest devices of this kind simply tell the user how much he has walked (kilo) meters per day, how many calories he has spent, and so on.  In fact, this is just an evolution of pedometers, a more advanced version of them.  Yes, some of them can drop readings to the cloud and share them on social networks, but they still remain pedometers. <br><br>  Devices that are evolutionarily higher can not only count the steps, but also measure the distance using GPS, measure the pulse, and on the basis of this data, prompt the user to move faster or slower for the best training pace.  And in the presence of a barometer can even count the number of flights of stairs. <br>  Even such devices can take data from external sensors (working on <a href="http://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/ANT%252B">ANT +</a> technology) - the speed of rotation of the wheels of the bike, pressure, weight, temperature, and so on.  The device retains the values ‚Äã‚Äãthat came from the sensors, and imposes them on the track.  Like this: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/bbf/009/797/bbf0097973338e782bf50afbcfb4e635.png" alt="image"><br>  <b>In the picture:</b> The entire left part of the picture, in the lower part is a watch that can simply show some parameters, at the top there are real wrist trainers, fixing achievements, a load schedule and the like. <br><br><h4>  Who is who in the world of watches? </h4><br><h5>  Adidas miCoach Smart Run <br></h5><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/92f/960/b2a/92f960b2a87c8347004afe471eed7f96.jpg" alt="image"><br>  A very advanced gadget from Adidas, a smart watch entirely focused on sports lifestyle and workout.  Includes GPS and pulse sensor in addition to the standard accelerometer, which is now in almost every smart watch. <br>  You can create workout plans or choose ready-made ones - cardio training, improved flexibility, strength training, training of certain muscle groups, or just relaxation.  The clock can even show short clips on the screen, suggesting how to do this or that exercise correctly, and give advice on increasing or decreasing the pace, based on the user's pulse and data on optimal and maximum cardio load. <br>  Unfortunately, this functionality also has its drawbacks - the battery charge is enough only for a training session lasting no more than 3-4 hours. <br>  <b>Reviews and information:</b> <a href="http://hi-tech.mail.ru/review/misc/adidas_miCoach_SMART_RUN.html">Review from Hi-Tech Mail.ru</a> , <a href="http://adidas.lifehacker.ru/2013/11/18/adidas-micoach-smart-run/">review from Lifehacker.ru</a> <br>  <b>Price:</b> from $ 400 <br>  <b>Availability:</b> recently appeared on sale in domestic online stores. <br><hr><br><br><h5>  Alpha MIO / Alpha LINK <br></h5><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/6d9/42a/0f8/6d942a0f8e6936f869a6a2123ee041bc.jpg" alt="image"><br>  Not really smart watch, but smart heart rate monitor.  It was the first device that reads the pulse without requiring a chest sensor ‚Äî instead, a light sensor that detects the heart rhythm works through the skin and vessels. <br>  I already wrote about how they work in <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/boxowerview/blog/206884/">their review</a> , but duplicate here: <br>  How does he work?  Simply.  Relatively easy.  Tissues without blood do not have a pronounced color, so they miss the whole spectrum.  Blood, unlike them, is red, and therefore absorbs the entire spectrum, except red. <br>  When you shine a flashlight through your hand, you see only a red glow.  This is due to the fact that most of the spectrum, except red, is absorbed by the blood.  With the observance of proper conditions (dim lantern, dark room) the human eye can also catch small changes in brightness, in time with the heartbeat. <br>  It means that when there is a lot of blood in the tissues of the hand, they reflect the radiation of the rest of the spectrum worse, and when there is little, they reflect better.  I am not talking about the reflection from the skin, which changes little, but about the translucence of the upper layer of the skin and the reflection from the internal tissues. <br>  Now it's easy - we shine a green LED under the skin, and remove the light fluctuations with the photosensor.  We filter from all interferences that go beyond 20 ... 200 oscillations per second, averaging over a dozen or two seconds and get the pulse value. <br><br>  Alpha MIO is a clock that can show time (amazingly!) And a pulse on its screen, Alpha LINK is a screenless version that has only a LED showing a cardio zone.  The data on the pulse in the same way as in the older version is transmitted to the phone, simply not shown on the watch itself. <br><br>  <b>Reviews and information:</b> <a href="http://hi-tech.mail.ru/article/mio_alpha_clock.html">Review from hi-tech.mail.ru</a> , <a href="http://appleinsider.ru/obzory-zheleza/mio-alpha-luchshij-drug-sportsmena.html">from appleinsider</a> , <a href="http://www.iphones.ru/iNotes/mio-alpha-review">from iphones.ru</a> , <a href="http://www.mobile-review.com/articles/2013/mio-alpha.shtml">from mobile-review</a> , <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/boxowerview/blog/206884/">from BoxOverview</a> , <a href="http://newrunners.ru/mag/trenirovki-po-pulsu-mio-alpha-i-lazernoe-shou/">from newrunners.ru</a> . <br>  <b>Price:</b> <a href="http://madrobots.ru/catalog/zdorove_2_0/pulsometr-mio-alpha/">7 990 rubles</a> for the Alpha MIO and <a href="http://madrobots.ru/catalog/zdorove_2_0/mio-link-kardiomonitor/">4 990 rubles</a> for the Alpha LINK in the store Madrobots.ru <br>  <b>Availability:</b> produced and sold. <br><hr><br><br><h5>  Basis b1 <br></h5><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/857/d03/2bd/857d032bd849af1b234cc42ead425a73.png" alt="image"><br>  Not how many smart watches, how many personal fitness tracker.

Let me remind you that Epson is a structural unit of the Seiko Group concern, the main specialization of which is watch products and precise mechanics.  Presented at <abbr title="Consumer electronics show">CES</abbr> 2014 Pulsense Watch is not the first Epson attempt to enter the market of wearable electronics.  Back in 1985, the RC-20 Wrist Computer watch appeared on the company's 8-bit microprocessor Zilog Z80 in the company's portfolio.  Among the standard features which were notes, world time and engineering calculator.  After nearly 30 years, Epson smart watches learned to track your heart rate, activity level, calories burned and sleep quality, but the display remained monochrome.  The amount of internal memory should be enough to record 480 hours of training.  To provide information in a digestible form, the manufacturer promised an application for iOS / Android and a web interface. <br>  <b>Reviews and information: The</b> <a href="http://www.epson.com/cgi-bin/Store/jsp/Landing/pulsense-fitness-sensing-watches.do%3Fref%3Dvan_pulsense">page on the official website of the company</a> , the announcement on <a href="http://www.engadget.com/2014/01/06/epson-pulsense-wearable/">engadget.com</a> . <br>  <b>Price:</b> At the time of this writing, pre-order was open at $ 200 per copy. <br>  <b>Availability:</b> pre-order. <br><hr><br><br><h5>  LifeTrak Zone R415 <br></h5><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/a29/147/a37/a29147a37b5d0fc4ef16b07e0c149398.png" alt="image"><br>  CES 2014 - a storehouse of smart watches, bracelets and other wearable electronics.  The LifeTrak Zone R415 presented at this event was equipped with a round-shaped monochrome display, a standard set of fitness functions, the ability to pair with a smartphone for displaying notifications and a smart alarm clock function, which itself understands when you fall asleep and does not require additional movements before bedtime.  The system of interchangeable straps is very similar to that of the Apple Watch.  One of the main advantages of this unit is its autonomy, which is 6 months of continuous work from one battery of the size CR2032 + and the ability to swim with this watch (dive to a depth of 30 meters).  They also know how to measure the user's pulse, although they do not do this by a photosensor, but by detecting contractions of the heart muscles (like an ECG).  This scheme is cheaper and easier than a photo sensor, but it has its drawbacks.  First, in contrast to the chest sensor, it is necessary to stop to measure - otherwise the watch catches skeletal muscle contractions while running and cannot separate them from the heart.  Secondly, the measurement requires electrical contact simultaneously with two hands - you need to touch the finger of the other hand (not the one on which the clock) to the second electrode (in these hours it acts as a metallized button) and wait ten seconds.  You can synchronize data with your smartphone through an application for Android and iOS. <br>  <b>Reviews and information:</b> <a href="http://lifetrakusa.com/products/smart/">official site</a> , express overview from CES from <a href="http://www.slashgear.com/lifetrak-zone-r415-hands-on-fitness-metrics-with-heart-rate-07312126/">c | net</a> and <a href="http://www.engadget.com/2014/01/08/lifetrak-zone-r415-hands-on/">SlashGear</a> . <br>  <b>Price:</b> 130 dollars. <br>  <b>Accessibility: the</b> start of sales was scheduled for the second quarter of 2014, but the official site still shows the ‚ÄúComing soon‚Äù die. <br><hr><br><br><h5>  Leikr <br></h5><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/73b/350/70d/73b35070d33bab630be1ca1ba5718e39.jpg" alt="image"><br>  Leikr is a creation of the Danish development team of athletes, and even those who come from Nokia, who launched their product on the market through fundraising on Kickstarter.  Given the size of Leikr, I don‚Äôt turn my tongue to call them a clock; rather, it‚Äôs a wrist / mobile navigator.  Developers position their product primarily as an assistant in track and field training.  Leikr is a completely independent device with a 2-inch color display (320x240, 65K colors) with a covered Gorilla Glass III glass, 300 MHz processor, 8 GB user memory, GPS, Wi-Fi, BT 4.0 and ANT + for connecting external sport sensors.  The operating system is self-developed and it runs on Linux.  Such large sizes initially do not imply everyday operation, but only sports orientation is confirmed by low autonomy (up to 6 hours with active GPS and no more than 24 hours in the target mode).

Sales started back in 2011 at a price of $ 249 for the device itself and $ 30 for the strap.  True, incorrect positioning and a fairly high price did not bring the success of the American company and by mid-2012 Motorola reduced the price to a sane $ 149 for the 8 GB version.  The absence of a strap in the delivery set implied the use of a standard clip for wearing the device on clothes.  I have a clock onboard with a 600 MHz processor, 256 MB of RAM, Bluetooth 4.0, ANT +, GPS and Wi-Fi.  The role of the operating system is strongly customized Android 2.3, i.e.  Despite the possibility of pairing with a smartphone, Motoactv is a standalone product that could be used purely as a pedometer, music player, or by working a bit with a file, <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/135382/">just like a tablet</a> .  Regarding the autonomy of Motorola, even at that time everything was quite good, with active pairing with a smartphone, the watch stably lived for 2 days and only activating the voracious GPS reduced the operating time to 8 hours.

The watch was presented at the CE Week exhibition, which was held in New York in the summer of 2013.  WearIT features very similar to the Motorola Motoactv: 600 MHz processor, 256 MB of RAM, Wi-Fi, GPS, Bluetooth 4.0, ANT +, and the operating system based on Android 4.4 KitKat.  The device has 4 GB of user memory and the ability to play audio files via Bluetooth.

The clock works on the basis of its OS and does not have the ability to synchronize data with a smartphone.  For convenient viewing of the collected information, an application is available for Windows / Mac or a web interface (there is no binding to the native service, alternatives can be used).  The TomTom Runner has GPS / GLONASS and an accelerometer in the arsenal, and the older model is also equipped with a pulse measurement sensor and Bluetooth.  Thanks to the use of the LCD display, the autonomy of the clock without GPS activation reaches several weeks (depending on how often you run) and up to 8 hours with active GPS.  There is also such a device as the Nike + SportWatch GPS, which produces all the same TomTom.  From the younger Runner model, the Nike branded watches differ in design, interface and binding to the Nikeplus.com service, and at a slightly lower price. <br>  <b>Reviews and information:</b> <a href="http://www.tomtom.com/en_us/products/your-sports/running/">official site</a> , express review from <a href="http://gps-club.ru/gps_think/detail.php%3FID%3D98607">GPS-club.ru</a> / <a href="https://secure-nikeplus.nike.com/plus/products/sport_watch/">Nike + SportWatch</a> official page, review from <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3DFYotAdECBPI">Rozetked</a> . <br>  <b>Price:</b> $ 150 for the younger model and $ 269 for the older, or <a href="http://madrobots.ru/catalog/zdorove_2_0/tomtom-runner/">8190 rubles</a> in the store Madrobots.ru (younger model) / Nike + SportWatch GPS for <a href="http://www.tomtom.com/en_us/products/your-sports/running/nike-gps-sportwatch/black-anthracite/index.jsp">$ 140</a> on the manufacturer's website and for <a href="http://madrobots.ru/catalog/umnye_chasy/intellektualnye-chasy-nike-sportwatch-gps/">5990 rubles</a> in Madrobots.ru. <br>  <b>Availability: for</b> sale. <br><hr><br><br><h5>  Polar V800 <br></h5><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/e46/cc1/34a/e46cc134a504bfffe15ccb1a9e5bcf75.jpg" alt="image"><br>  The V800 is not a smart watch, but a real wrist computer for athletes.

In addition to the standard features for calculating the distance traveled, measuring overall activity and sleep quality, the watch can also measure heart rate using a sensor located on the back side.  You can synchronize the data with smartphones based on Android, iOS and, notably, Windows Phone.  Autonomy is declared at the level of 7 days with a permanent connection to the smartphone and up to 4 months without pairing.

CooKoo Watch developer Peter Hauser initially pursued the goal of making a simple and stylish device to constantly display the current time and notifications from your smartphones. Admittedly, he did it. With the requested $ 150,000, Peter was able to collect twice as much and in December 2012 the first devices fell into the hands of the Beckers. The notification system and the clock itself are independent devices and are powered from different sources. Thus, the watch should work for about 3 years without changing the battery, and the electronics that are responsible for pairing with a smartphone for up to 1 year. For notification of notifications available 6 fixed icons and vibration.Additional features include a programmable ‚ÄúCommand‚Äù button on which you can ‚Äúhang‚Äù, for example, setting marks on a map or managing music on a smartphone.

The watch has the same manufacturer (CONNECTEDEVICE Ltd.), and the rebranding, apparently, was made because of not the best reviews about CooKoo Watch of the first generation: delays in production, terrible software and permanent loss of communication with the smartphone. What has changed in the second version: added a small monochrome display to display the number or name of the caller, a new design and an application for iOS and Android. Separate power, 6 information indicators and dust and moisture protection have not changed. Along with the Cogito Original, the manufacturer has released a cheaper model with simplified functionality (the electronics remained independent) and a completely plastic case. The choice is available in 6 colors, and indeed this model is more suitable for girls and it is smaller and lighter in size. Display naturallyremoved, and the number of indicators reduced to four.

Do they even live up to lunch? <br>  <b>Reviews and information: a</b> preview with IFA from <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3DrBfObXxA_WQ%26list%3DUUDF_NIAEkcAUvzxe1DUzaQA">Rozetked</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3DHUSQSn96dag">Droider.Ru</a> . <br>  <b>Price:</b> 14990 rubles (300 euros). <br>  <b>Availability:</b> pre-order (October). <br><hr><br><br><h5>  Apple Watch <br></h5><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/e06/79f/97f/e0679f97f640617e4d10a8599f69fd27.jpg" alt="image"><br>  Smart watches from Apple were probably waited by everyone who is at least a little aware of what a smart watch is.  They even say that some particularly impressionable person experienced an orgasm during a long-awaited presentation.  Information about the product of the apple company is not very much, because  they will go on sale only in the first quarter of 2015.  From what is known: contact magnetic charging (like a MacBook), pulse sensor, Wi-Fi b / g, BT 4.0, button, wheel and touch layer with pressure force recognition for interacting with the clock interface.  The display is covered with at least long-awaited sapphire glass (in the Watch and Watch Edition models) and some ‚ÄúStrengthened Ion-X glass‚Äù in the Watch Sport model.  The case of the device is protected from moisture, but the possibility of immersion in water is still questionable. <br>  <b>Reviews and information:</b> <a href="http://www.iphones.ru/iNotes/apple-watch-announce">news on iphones.ru</a> <br>  <b>Price:</b> from $ 349 <br>  <b>Availability:</b> Sales will begin in early 2015. <br><hr><br><br><h5>  Alcatel wave <br></h5><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/31a/dde/f6d/31addef6dfad0a27a13ba21ead072859.jpg" alt="image"><br>  Alcatel decided to try something new, bringing their first smart watches to the IFA in Berlin.  The guys decided that they had nothing to sit on the same platform with such big uncles like Samsung, LG, Asus or Motorola and said that they were developing a watch on their platform.  The clock has a slightly smaller screen than the competition - 1.2 '.  On the other side of the screen, the Alcatel Wave has a pulse sensor, like the Mio Alpha.  The USB port at one end of the strap, like some fitness bracelets, was also an interesting solution. <br>  <b>Reviews and information:</b> <a href="http://www.allsmartwatch.ru/alcatel/ifa-2014-alcatel-prodemonstrirovala-umnye-chasy-na-sobstvennoi-platforme">news at allsmartwatch.ru</a> <br>  <b>Price:</b> pre-$ 129 <br>  <b>Availability:</b> Sales have not started yet. <br><hr><br><br><h5>  Sony Smartwatch 3 <br></h5><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/ace/085/d57/ace085d573564e61bf14db15d5a6eeda.jpg"><br>  Unification is in full swing - the new smart watches from Sony also received Android Wear as a platform.  As one would expect, this leads to the fact that the characteristics of the watches become approximately the same, and it is not entirely clear what exactly makes this watch stand out from the rest of the watch on Android Wear?  Well, except that interesting designs strap. <br>  <b>Reviews and information:</b> <a href="http://www.sotovik.ru/news/234967-sony-smartwatch-3-japonskie-smart-chasi-na-android-wear.html">news from sotovik.ru</a> <br>  <b>Price:</b> $ 296 <br>  <b>Availability:</b> Sales have not started yet. <br><hr><br><br>  PS We still opened a new <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/madrobots/blog/233625/">store</a> in the Mega Belaya Dacha shopping center.
