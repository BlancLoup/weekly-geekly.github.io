They were the bulk of the passengers, they were noisy, they were enthusiastically discussing how they would pounce on cookies now. <br><br>  8:30  We arrived straight to LenExpo.  People, despite the very beginning of registration, there were many.  There were too many registrars, so it took literally about five minutes to get the badge.

      Throwing off his jacket in the wardrobe, he went to the exhibition hall.  It is worth mentioning that for the First Days I am for the first time, therefore I will not carry out any analogies, because there is nothing to do with it. <br><br>  The booth is spacious, for the benefit of the participants, nothing at all: Oracle, MySQL, Intel, Deutsche Bank, several stands with Java ... sorry, with Java, at the end there is a small stage where balalaika players and dombrists played (honestly, sincerely)  On the sides of the stage, special comrades issued coffee / tea and cookies to those who wanted it.  There were many who wished. <br><br>  In an hour I managed to get around all the racks, none of which interested me except souvenirs.  Well, except that it was fun to listen to the controversy at the NetBeans stand, where the visitor urged the stand keeper of the shortcomings of the system in industrial use.  In the meantime, I managed to drink coffee with cookies and chocolate.  Before the beginning of the plenary report, half an hour remained which I spent in listening to the sound of the balalaika and dombra. <br><br>  10:10.  With difficulty and elbows, making my way to the hall of the first section, I managed to occupy a sitting position.  The chair had a stand for writing, on which I with a smart look put a notebook and prepared to record the event. <br><br>  The reports were very entertaining.  Everything is in English, as the developers from Europe looked at us through the Internet and were especially ardent from where they came from. <br><br>  10:25  The head of the local center of very high tech java appeared on the scene  He greeted everyone and left.  Began, in fact, reports. <br><br>  First of all, Angela M. Caicedo showed us how to draw with a finger on the board, then she showed the same thing on her mobile.  Do not forget, I have a camera at home, it would be something to show, and excuse me - I will show it on my fingers. <br><br>  Simon Ritter showed how it is now simple to form-slap in JavaFX, after a minute having bungled an app playing a video without opening the code at all.  He threw a video on the form, a Play button and a scroll bar.  Tied them up with arrows and voila.  The application, of course, demonstrated in the work and on the poppy, and on mobile. <br><br>  Alexander Nikolaevich (he forgot his last name) showed everyone the facial recognition system, of course, written in Java.  The system amused the public with a robot-like synthesizer of the Russian language, which broke out at the appearance of someone familiar in the action vector of the ip-camera. <br><br>  11:00  The fun was over, with the introduction to the scene of a friend already the head of the Center, who said that Gosling did not keep up with the plenary, so Deputy Octavian Donassi would replace him. <br><br>  Octavian, apparently, is a man of the old school.  I did not indulge the audience, simply switched on the projector and drove the presentation slides and the lecture on the topic ‚ÄúWhy is it ... ugh!  Java is cool. ‚Äù  Figures, graphs, growth and prosperity, strategy and plans for the conquest of humanity. <br><br>  The audience gradually sank into sleep.  The youth, in abundance, began to play pranks.  Rare comrades reached for the exit. <br><br>  11:20.  Donassi noticed the mood of the listeners and began to hurl the ducks (small talismans of the company).  I managed to hit someone on the balcony, but the target was relaxed and dropped the duck into the hall.  The maneuver with the Dyuk was a success, but not for long.  After 10 minutes, the dream again began to take his own. <br><br>  I only paid attention to the mention of the great contribution of the developer community to the improvement of JRuby.  The flow of leaking listeners increased. <br><br>  11:35.  Angela and Simon reappeared on the scene.  People cheered up.  Angela showed the application on MobileFX, with which you can follow the championship of South Africa in football.  The program showed a calendar of meetings, information about the teams, photos, etc. All this with the special effects of blackout, animation, and the like. <br><br>  Revealed JavaFX Composer plugin for NetBeans.  It allows you to develop JFX software in form-slap mode and gives access to the API of many network services. <br><br>  11:50  Angela demonstrated the process of creating an application using JavaFXComposer.  Literally on my knee I collected an applet that, using Google api, searches for images by the entered request.  Angela herself as a default put the word "flower" (flower). <br><br>  Launched it on a poppy.  I poured it onto my mobile phone, but I couldn‚Äôt demonstrate it there - the Internet did not work on the phone, unfortunately. <br><br>  Simon demonstrated the development of JavaFX for the desktop.  He showed a beautiful clock, each parameter of which is decorated in the form of circles and a wonderful book.  The book is on the monitor screen, but it works for live - the pages turn over, the cover is rigid, and the pages are soft, bend.  The pages of the book were shown earlier hours. <br><br>  12:00  Brazdy again took Octavian.  Finished the present and released all. <br><br>  By this time I was already very tired and decided to end my acquaintance with the exhibition. <br><br>  As a conclusion, I can say that the event looks quite professional, but at the same time there is nothing really interesting, nothing revolutionary, not disturbing.  Although I probably want too much from the exhibition. <br><br>  The problem of a motley audience is present.  Someone really came just for the sake of cookies, souvenirs, etc.  If the percentage of specialists at least 30-40 would be quieter, and so it‚Äôs a farce. <br><br>  With all the security measures, quite a lot of left-wing people have leaked onto the exhibition.  Grandmother some in colorful jackets, frank gopnik.  Apparently, free food attracted. <br><br>  But in general, as a whole ... Good.  Yet at the exhibition there are real experts.  They are interesting to listen to. <br><br>  If Friday is free, I advise you to go.  Registration starts at 9:00, the first report at 10:00.  Here is the program.  The most convenient way is to go with Primorskaya, and there either by a free bus, which I never noticed, or by 10 trolley buses.  Good luck. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/90440/">https://habr.com/ru/post/90440/</a></p>
