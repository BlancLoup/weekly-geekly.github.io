Outside the window of the car, despite the late time, it was quite light. Trees, telegraph poles, forest glades glimpsed. In my mind, I was already in my native Ivanovo. On August 24, I would be twenty years old. I imagined how I would appear day in my home. My imagination began to paint one picture after another. A quiet, almost country street. A house with a gate and a wicket to the garden, with green trim on the windows. The parents in the last letter asked me about plans for the future. so simple. " <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/c77/25f/3dd/c7725f3dd9214870acc8f63d31cbfec1.png"><br><br>  Did the plans, at that time, of a young lad, become a star, a pioneer, a pioneer in the formation and development of computer technology in the USSR?  Researcher in the laboratory of computer technology of the Institute of Electrical Engineering of the Academy of Sciences of the Ukrainian SSR, deputy director for the scientific department and head of the specialized digital machines department at the Computing Center of the Academy of Sciences of the Ukrainian SSR, head of the cybernetics department and head of the control machines department at the Institute of Cybernetics named after V. Glushkov of the NAS of Ukraine correspondent of the Academy of Sciences of the Ukrainian SSR, adviser to the directorate, chief designer of the first in the USSR UVM "Dnepr", chairman of the Council on automation of scientific research at the Presidium  Academy of Sciences of the Ukrainian SSR, author and co-author of more than 200 scientific works and inventions in the field of computer science and technology, was awarded the Order of the October Revolution, Red Banner of Labor, World War I and II degree, the Red Star, Bogdan Khmelnitsky, medals "For Military Merit", " For the defense of Moscow "," For the victory over Germany ", was awarded the Diploma of the Supreme Council of the Ukrainian SSR and the Certificate of Honor of the Supreme Council of Ukraine ... but this is all in the future, and now this young man is face to face with the war ... <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Boris Malinovsky was born on August 24, 1921 in the town of Lukh, Ivanovo Region (Russia).  His parents - father Nikolai Vasilievich worked as a teacher and chairman in the Lukh school, was a very educated person, graduated from two higher institutions of the St. Petersburg Theological Academy and St. Petersburg Imperial Archaeological Institute, mother Lyubov Nikolaevna was a teacher of Russian language and literature.  They were born and brought up in a family of clergymen, although, as Boris Nikolayevich himself recalled, children were raised in the spirit of atheism, as society demanded at that time.  Boris was the third child in the family, although the elder brother Kostya died at an early age from an illness.

In 1916 he became director of the private Kostroma women's gymnasium he created.  Here he met my future mother, Lyubov Nikolaevna Sokolskaya, one of the gymnasium teachers.  So fate has connected two beautiful souls and bodies of people into one Malinovsky family ‚Äù. <br><br>  When Boris was three years old, the family moved to the city Rodniki, here he went to school, and in 1936 he moved again, this time to the regional center of Ivanovo.  This move saved the head of the family from a possible arrest and execution; many of his father‚Äôs comrades (teachers) in the Springs overtook arrests, exiles, executions.  The hard fate of Boris Nikolayevich's parents, the eldest son was lost at the age of one, the middle son Leo died at war at the age of 24, and the youngest daughter died of sarcoma.  There was only one heir and successor of the family - Boris. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/e78/419/d57/e78419d57c2543b684473a8b536a5a61.png"><br>  <i>father Nikolai, Boris, Lev Malinovskie</i> <br><br>  In Ivanovo, Boris graduated from school, entered the first year of the Leningrad Mining Institute and was immediately drafted into the army. <br><br>  "... I really wanted to return to the institute from where I was drafted into the army, and I believed that it was possible. When we, freshmen students, became aware that we would serve in the army, we were collected several times and offered to enter various military schools Some students agreed, but the majority decided to be called, believed that after serving 2 3 years, you can return to college. So I thought. " <br><br>  But as it is known, after 2 years the war did not end, and the young guy completely experienced all the horrors of what was happening.  Boris Nikolaevich wrote about the years of the Great Patriotic War and his ministry in the ranks of the soldiers in all colors in the book <a href="http://voenpravda.ru/%25D0%25BC%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BB%25D0%25B8%25D0%25BD%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B2%25D1%2581%25D0%25BA%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B9.html">The Way of the Soldier</a> .  The book is indeed read in one breath, plunges into the atmosphere of what is happening in full: <br><br>  ‚ÄúSending letters home, I tried not to upset my parents.  He kept silent about the fact that he was under fire several times, which could have been a victim of betrayal, as he was freezing in a snowy forest on the banks of the Volga, about his sufferings after being wounded.  The only thing that I allowed myself - wrote that I was wounded, and even then not immediately ... Numerous, almost simultaneous explosions - on the right, left, in front, behind surrounded me, which fell flat on the ground.  There was a ringing sound in their ears, a sharp powder smell struck in their nose, whistles were whistling around, fragments were beating furiously at the trees and the ground.  There were miracles in the war: in this hell I remained alive ... The war stopped for me to be something unusual, turned into an everyday matter, or rather, into some very hard, deadly, but obligatory work.  And yet, the black spots where we had been in active defense for many months, knew almost every tree and every noticeable bump in the swamp, forever bumped into memory.  Separate, most memorable events, battle episodes and images of my dear front comrades also emerge in my memory.  Many of them fell to the death of the brave in the forests and marshes of the northwest. ‚Äù <br><br>  Boris served until the end of World War II and went the hard way of a soldier, later an officer.  He began as an ordinary artillery officer in the 108th howitzer (later cannon) artillery regiment of the RGC (1939-1941), and was greeted by the commander of the 76-mm battery of the 84th artillery regiment of the 55th Mozyr Red Banner Division (1942-1945). <br><br>  After the war, Boris Nikolayevich returned home to his native Ivanovo.  Here, being a second year student at the Ivanovo Energy Institute, he married Oktyabris Nikolaevna Akkuratnova (the funny name given by his father, an avid Bolshevik, he named two more daughters Freedom and Idea).  She worked for many years at the Kiev Institute of Cybernetics of the Ukrainian SSR Academy of Sciences.  In 1950 he graduated with honors.  But to continue his studies as a graduate student at the department of the electric drive did not work due to the fact that the inviting leader Malinovsky was just a candidate of science.  Therefore, a young, enthusiastic graduate enrolled in graduate school at the Institute of Electrical Engineering of the Ukrainian SSR Academy of Sciences.  The obstacle was the Ukrainian language, the exam in which Boris failed, but a year later he successfully re-passed it. <br><br>  Here, together with Sergei Alekseevich Lebedev, he worked on the creation of a lampless trigger, the work was classified.  At that time, the MESM was already developed in the laboratory of Academician Lebedev.  Malinovsky was very involved in this field of activity, in the field of digital computing.  When moving to Kiev (at that time, Malinovsky had a son, who was named after his murdered brother, Leo), the young family lived in a twenty-square-meter apartment on the outskirts of the city. <br><br>  About his wife Oktyabris Nikolaevna he wrote: <br><br>  ‚ÄúOnce I was on the anniversary (the seventieth anniversary) of academician K. K. Khrenov.  I remember the answer to the question posed to the hero of the day: <br><br>  - How to explain the success in your research? <br><br>  - I owe this to my half!  - said the venerable academician, hugged and kissed his wife sitting next to him. <br><br>  I think that I would answer a similar question as well. ‚Äù <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/a22/840/382/a228403827844cbf848b65d814e09133.png"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/528/f3d/366/528f3d36602343208442f9a1097e0ef0.png"><br>  <i>Oktyabrisa</i> <br><br>  The thesis work of Boris Nikolayevich was associated with the study of the magnetic elements of digital computers, he defended it in 1953.  The opponent was Lebedev, his assessment was positive. <br><br>  In 1958, Lebedev's laboratory became the Computing Center of the Ukrainian SSR Academy of Sciences.  Work began on a two-machine radar system for detecting airborne targets and targeting fighters at them.  The groups were led by B.N.  Malinovsky and Z.L.  Rabinovich.  Boris Nikolayevich attended seminars in Moscow devoted to digital computer technology for air defense defense purposes (analog technology was used in this area).  He developed a radar signal device.  Such seminars made it possible to make acquaintances, to communicate with well-known experts in the field of the development of air defense systems.  Later, an agreement was even concluded with the Moscow Scientific Research Institute-5 on cooperation in the development of a two-machine defense system.  Under the contract it was necessary to train the leading specialists of NII-5 digital technology. <br><br>  In 1962, the Computing Center was transformed into the Institute of Cybernetics, led by Glushkov.  Malinovsky became the head of one of the departments of the Institute, which was engaged in the development of the semiconductor UMSHN "Dnepr" (multi-purpose control machine). <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/d94/72f/9f1/d9472f9f1e0f41ae91a40836a2d8d6a9.png"><br>  <i>UMShN "Dnepr"</i> <br><br>  I wrote about its serial production at the ‚ÄúRadiopribor‚Äù plant, later on ‚ÄúElectronmash‚Äù in the previous article.  At the end of 1957, Glushkov put forward the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãcreating a universal UVM instead of specialized ones, such an idea was of great importance for the subsequent development and application of cybernetics in the management of technical systems. <br><br>  State Commission on the Dnipro car: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/432/489/c85/432489c8559a4514aea885d56bc27fa9.png"><br><br>  1. The UMSHN machine is the first multi-purpose semiconductor control machine in the USSR, designed to control and control a number of production facilities in various industries, as well as to study objects.  In addition, the machine can be used as a general-purpose universal computing machine. <br><br>  2. The machine has a number of original technical solutions that really provide a wide use of the machine, sectional construction of memory blocks and a switch, software exchange of information between the machine and the object, the ability to connect to non-standard sensors, electronic switch signals, etc. <br><br>  The commission considers that the proposed technical documentation for the UMSN machine is suitable for mastering the serial production of the machine. A final adjustment of the documentation follows through the process of mastering an experimental series of machines. <br><br>  B. N. Malinovsky and E. L. Yushchenko proposed the basic principles of building a universal control machine: <br><ul><li>  semiconductor element base, which provided the required reliability of systems </li><li>  the speed required for real-time operation </li><li>  limited bit grid (26 machine word bits) </li><li>  sufficient for the accuracy of calculations of most process control algorithms </li><li>  two-address command system </li><li>  high reliability </li></ul><br><br>  Over the next five years, Boris Nikolayevich initiated and supervised work on the development of digital control machines based on the Dnepr UMShN in industry, energy and other projects.  Began to publish the magazine "Control Systems and Machines" on the initiative of Malinovsky. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/4a0/4b7/077/4a04b7077789462f833ac5b593765e7e.png"><br><br>  ‚ÄúIn 1964, on the basis of the work performed, Malinovsky defended his doctoral thesis on the‚Äú Development and application of a multi-purpose control machine UMSN Dnepr ‚Äù. <br><br>  From the memoirs of B.N. Malinovsky: <br><br>  Five years later, after this most difficult year, when we had almost constantly to be in the factory‚Äôs workshop where UMShN was making, I came from Sweden, where I gave a report at the IFAC-IFIP symposium on computer control for industry, I met the chief technologist of the plant pores - V.A. Zgursky (he later became the director of the plant, and then the mayor of Kiev). <br><br>  He asked me: <br><br>  - Boris Nikolayevich, what are you so sad about? <br><br>  - In the United States and England, those who need it are already introducing computer technology, while with us, I waved my hand. <br><br>  ‚ÄúI must repent,‚Äù said Valentin Arsentievich, ‚Äúwhen you transferred UMSHN to the factory for serial production ‚Äî I did everything possible so that it would not go!‚Äù  And now I am ready to kneel in front of you, ‚Äùhe continued,‚Äú to ask for help to install an UMSHN in the electroplating shop and to create a control system for electroplating automatons on its basis.  I realized that this is very promising! <br><br>  After this meeting with the former chief technologist, it became clear why the ‚Äúintroduction‚Äù of the UMSHN into mass production went so hard! <br><br>  I remember that his request was extremely happy: it means that our consumers of computer technology realized its capabilities, and if so, everything will go well with us, and not only in the USA, England and other developed countries! <br><br>  By naivety, I still continued to think that everything new and progressive should immediately find support, that they only write about resistance to technological progress in books. " <br><br>  In 1967-1973, Malinovsky was the chief designer of the first in Ukraine mini-computer "M-180" (UVK "Sokol"), designed for automation systems of mass scientific laboratory experiment and the head of work on its application. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/4c7/b82/d78/4c7b82d78e3f44aaa194849f1c32040b.png"><br>  <i>mini-computer "M-180"</i> <br><br>  Designed such a machine based on large integrated circuits, belonged to the machines of the fourth generation.  The first mini-computer in Ukraine was released in the amount of just a few dozen.  It had no analogues abroad, but at that time the EU program and the SM computer, copied from western machines, was massively unfolding.  It even received applications in the amount of 3000 copies, but this, alas, had no effect on its mass production. <br><br>  The first chapter "The Road to the Half-Century" from the book by Boris Malinovsky "There is nothing more expensive ...": <br><br>  ‚Äú1969  At the same time, on my initiative, work began on drawing up a ‚ÄúProgram for creating mini and micro-computers using modern technological bases‚Äù.  Her appearance was not accidental.  A year ago, we sent information about the M-180 computer to various organizations, received three thousand letters from potential consumers of the machine.  I was able to get in touch with some of them, and I drew the most active ones to the compilation of the ‚ÄúProgram‚Äù in order to justify together the fields of application of mini and micro-computers and their parameters.  I spoke about the draft program at the academic council of the institute and was approved by V.M. Glushkov.  Joint work with DI Yuditsky allowed us to take the next step - to proceed to the drafting of proposals for the creation of an experimental sample of the first domestic micro-computer and an integrated program of research and work on the creation of micro-computers, software and peripheral equipment. ‚Äù <br><br>  In the same year, Malinovsky was elected a corresponding member of the Academy of Sciences of the Ukrainian SSR, and in 1971 he headed the department of cybernetic engineering of the Institute, which was engaged in the development of computational tools, their practical applications, developing the direction of "cybernetic engineering" oriented on the practical application of computers. <br><br>  Malinovsky himself said that there were special requirements for the computing facilities that are part of the cybernetic technology tools, and high speed was no longer the main criterion, and there were special requirements for the organization of the computing process.  Information processing in real time, cyclical repetition of the same programs, only with different initial conditions, orientation of computational tools to certain classes of computation - these are the requirements that became the main ones, it became necessary to build distributed hierarchical, homogeneous, ring and other computational structures.  Required systemic versatility. <br><br>  In 1973-1986, Malinovsky took part in the development of the first microcomputer "Electronics S-5", "Neuron", as well as in the development of signaling processes for ground and airborne communication systems of the new generation. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/bf0/773/e55/bf0773e55adb4bf485797e4fad055d13.png"><br>  <i>C5-01 electronics</i> <br><br>  In 1998, he organized the International Symposium ‚ÄúComputers in Europe.  Past, Present and Future ‚Äùwith the participation of Sir Maurice Wilks (Great Britain), the creator of EDSAC, the first computer with ROM, in an attempt to reanimate the computer industry of Ukraine.  The plenary session began with information on the history of computer science and technology, programming.  The presentation of the events by their direct participants made a great impression (85-year-old Professor Maurice Wilkes - the father of microprogramming also made a speech).  Malinovsky recalled the merits of Ukrainian developers in the field of computing.  It all started with 16 staff in 1957, more than 15 types of computers were developed for process control.  It was told about the family of onboard control vehicles "Karat", which were used on many submarines and missile carriers, about "Electronmash".  Computer engineering of Ukraine provided approximately 60-70% of all control systems.  At the Institute of Cybernetics, 40 types of computers were developed - almost a third of computers manufactured in the USSR.  The first in Europe integrated circuits were developed and began to be mass produced at Mikropribor and Kristall. <br><br>  In the mid-60s, representatives of the Yuzhmash plant from Dnepropetrovsk (codename ‚ÄúPlant No. 586‚Äù, addressed the main Soviet intercontinental and space carriers) asked Boris Nikolayevich to help automate the testing of rocket engines. <br><br>        ,         ¬´¬ª,        .       ¬´ ¬ª,     80%    60-80  ‚Äî  .     1944 ,   ,  .         ‚Äî -1 (  -2).       ¬´¬ª.   ,   .      ,          .  ,         .    ‚Äî       -1. <br><br>     ‚Äî -1, -2  -5 (     ).           .     ,       .          . <br><br>   -7  ,      -12  .  -14 (   SS-5,   ‚Äî 4500 )     ‚Äî -16 (SS-7)    13  ,          . <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/4d7/62a/85e/4d762a85e2b54fa191af59706d5957b1.png"><br> <i>-12</i> <br><br>  1971       -36 (SS-18).     ¬´ ¬ª,      ,       .         ¬´¬ª, ¬´¬ª, ¬´-2¬ª, ¬´-3¬ª.     ,   70   ,      400. <br><br>         ,     . <br><br>    ‚Ä¶     :   ,   ,        ,   ,   ,       .,        ‚Äî   .    ,      ,   (-   ).            ¬´¬ª  ¬´-32¬ª.        . <br><br>           ,       ,           ¬´¬ª. <br><br><h3>        </h3><br> "‚Ä¶, !   ‚Ä¶   ,     ,  !        ,     .      ,     ,    ,    . ,   ,    ,      ,     .         . ,            ,  ,    . <br><br>    ,   ‚Äî  ,      .
