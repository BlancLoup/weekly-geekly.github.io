Introduction</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Without sharing the views of the visiting old man Immanuel at breakfast, I will nevertheless try to analyze the objective moments of the free software phenomenon that is brought into the light from the shadow of the free software phenomenon, which facilitates the accounting fuss of our ordinary, suffering from the frail metal. <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  I think the need for the phenomenon of open source software is proved by its very existence and is no longer in doubt, at least among the readers of this blog.  It is not my stated hypothesis that sooner or later SPO will dominate in all mass market segments, and first of all, where software plays infrastructure, and therefore is very important for everyone, the role seems to be quite consistent. <br><br>  Taking it into service, take a look at the market (markets) accounting (business) software.  This market is not monolithic and it is easy for any marketer to divide it into segments.

      <br>
      The question is, are there among these segments where, according to the accepted hypothesis, the existence or even the dominance of STR?  At present, the factual side of the matter does not allow us to state that this is possible.  Neither the US, nor the European, nor the Russian market, give examples of successfully developing and really applying for open source software projects of accounting. <br><br>  However, to conclude that it is not possible in principle, it seems to me premature.  Just by the fact that the arrival of open source software is just beginning.  Such solutions as Desktop Linux, OpenOffice.org, Jabber are just beginning their journey to conquer the market. <br><br>  Pseudo-analysts often interfere with the processes that occur, first inflating the hype around the early arrival of Linux, and then slyly grinning at its failed return, which was recently predicted by them themselves. <br><br>  It is necessary to understand that the process of the arrival of open source software on the market is different from the process of changing one proprietary market leader to another.  This process can take a long time, since there is no single force interested in entering the leader‚Äôs throne as quickly as possible. <br><br>  If a proprietary product in a short time after the appearance does not occupy a sufficient market share, then we can safely declare its insolvency due to, as a rule, limited resources allocated by the investor to his rise.  This is the law of the proprietary software market.  It does not apply to the evaluation of prospects for an open source project. <br><br>  Behind SPO projects, as a rule, are not worth significant financial resources.  Therefore, the speed of progress of such projects may not be high.  But on the other hand, these projects do not have the Damoklov sword of return on investment in tightly defined deadlines, since open source projects, as a rule, from the very beginning live on self-sufficiency and / or small sources of personal developer resources. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/3616/">https://habr.com/ru/post/3616/</a></p>
