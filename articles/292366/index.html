      Why and how did this blog come about?  The fact is that in this project we have combined the pleasant with the useful: my desire to run a blog on entrepreneurship in IT and a tool to promote our <a href="http://teamdesk.ru/">help desk system</a> for customer support.  Initially, the idea was to run a thematic blog on the subject of Customer Support, but it was not so interesting. <br><br>  Let's take a look at the blog statistics.  The first entry " <a title="A dollar for 65? Nafig crisis! We are launching a startup!" href="http://teamdesk.ru/blog/%3Fp%3D1">Dollar for 65?</a>  <a title="A dollar for 65? Nafig crisis! We are launching a startup!" href="http://teamdesk.ru/blog/%3Fp%3D1">Nafig crisis!</a>  <a title="A dollar for 65? Nafig crisis! We are launching a startup!" href="http://teamdesk.ru/blog/%3Fp%3D1">We are launching a startup!</a>  ¬ªAppeared in it on January 15, 2015.  She became the most popular (at least for now) note in the blog.  Now the blog has only 15 posts and 131 comments.  Some notes recruited dozens of reposts on social networks.  The first post set a record - 144 reposts on Facebook and 20 retweets. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/1e5/b46/a5e/1e5b46a5ed2747fd8b196387b56ac01e.png" width="100%"><br><br>  Now take a look at the traffic that we received solely at the expense of the blog.  Below is a screenshot of Yandex Metrics.  As you can see, before the first note in the block in January 2015, there was no traffic on the site at all.  Also on the screenshot clearly visible peaks - this is the output of new articles in the blog. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/fb8/a9d/dce/fb8a9ddce6bb4089bd28241bb6b03bd6.png" width="100%"><br><br>  In total for the first half of 2015 on teamdesk.ru we received: <br><ul><li>  <strong>35,159</strong> visits </li><li>  <strong>20 193</strong> unique visitors </li><li>  <strong>758</strong> registrations in the ticket system </li><li>  <strong>465</strong> blog followers </li></ul><br>  Surely, there are much more successful corporate blogs, take the same CallBackHunter, but the current results allow you to attract customers and subscribers.  Now I want to share with you some of my thoughts on blogging. <br><br><h3>  1. A blog is needed for any business. </h3><br>  I'm not kidding, for anyone!  Do repairs or you have your own car service - get a channel on Youtube and post videos about your work, useful tips, customer reviews.  You have your own legal advice - publish useful content and expert notes.  And if you are a god forbid IT startup, then a blog can be your main source of customers for you, as in our case. <br><br>  Here are some examples of interesting Russian blogs, where guys talk about their business: <br><ul><li>  Fedor Ovchinnikov and DoDo-pizza (I recommend reading from the end) - <a href="http://sila-uma.ru/">http://sila-uma.ru/</a> </li><li>  Ayaz Shabutdinov and Like Holding (you can also read from the end) - <a href="https://vk.com/ayazshabutdinov">https://vk.com/ayazshabutdinov</a> </li><li>  Ruslan Tatunashvili and CallBackHunter - <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/Tatunashvili">https://www.youtube.com/user/Tatunashvili</a> </li><li>  MoeDelo's blog c video interview - <a href="http://www.moedelo.org/journal/">http://www.moedelo.org/journal/</a> </li></ul><br>  If you know other interesting blogs - write in the comments and I add to the note. <br><br><h3>  2. Need original idea and useful content. </h3><br>  Simply posting translated articles or non-unique content is useless.  It will not be read, it will not be distributed, your posts will not wait.  So in our blog, I try to share our experience, openly talk about incomes / expenses, tell the tricks I use myself. <br><br>  Below you can see a screenshot of Mailchimp, which shows the statistics of our newsletters by blog subscribers.  OpenRate about 47% and ClickRate about 25% say that you like our blog and I write for good reason =) <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/8ab/f50/174/8abf50174f3844128fdce012b2e95d59.png" width="100%"><br><br>  By and large, I see 3 basic blog concepts: <br><ul><li>  ‚Äú <strong>Naked business</strong> ‚Äù - here we tell all about our business, successes and failures, publish figures, etc.  In fact, our blog is just that. </li><li>  "The <strong>storehouse of information</strong> " - in this blog, we post mega-useful content on a specific topic.  An example of such a blog <a href="https://lpgenerator.ru/blog/">https://lpgenerator.ru/blog/</a> is a lot of useful information about marketing, internet marketing, landing pages, etc. </li><li>  " <strong>Superhero</strong> " - in fact it is a personal blog, which is based on the identity of one particular person.  This character must be really interesting, unusual, charismatic. </li></ul><br><h3>  3. Spend 20% of the time on content creation, 80% on distribution </h3><br>  I will say one thing, without promotion, even super interesting content will remain a dead weight on your blog.  No one will ever know about him.  I read many foreign articles on how to promote your blog and content.  So - we have many things practically do not work.  Let's start in order: <br><ul><li>  We do not have to make guest blog posts.  I do not mean webmaster blogs, but some company blogs or subject / industry blogs.  Let your content be three times unique and interesting - either not published at all, or for money.  There are exceptions, but they can be counted on the fingers.  In an English-speaking environment, probably up to 50% of blog posts can be guest with explicit indication of the author and live links to the project. </li><li>  We have not taken to put active links to other blogs and resources.  Casual mention may be, but no more. </li><li>  In the English segment, if you have good content, you can find bloggers with the audience you need and ask them to post a link to your material on Twitter or Facebook.  It does not work for us!  Well, maybe only by great friendship, and not always. </li></ul><br><h3>  4. How do we promote our posts? </h3><br>  How do we promote our content?  Through trial and error, we found several working sources.  Below is a screenshot of the metric, where you can see the main sources of traffic to the site (not just the blog): <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/f92/d0b/739/f92d0b739fc441b4a6c340f40a5ff7b7.png" width="100%"><br><br>  As you can see, we get quite a lot of direct visits, this shows the general awareness of Timdesk, which we received from the blog and publications on third-party sites. <br><br>  Next come the social networks.  Here it is necessary to tell in more detail.  The fact is that without a definite crop, the articles do not diverge by themselves so well.  Therefore, in addition to the simple posting of links to the material in your profile, we try to place links in the thematic communities.  I note that we have never placed a charge and have not promoted our posts.  Facebook works best now, but I think with the right approach and from Vkontakte you can get a lot of transitions. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/6e1/e7f/fba/6e1e7ffba0c04cb2b621ac1e879c760d.png" width="100%"><br><br>  We also place our posts on 2 thematic platforms, which are ideally suited for our topics.  This, as you probably already guessed, Megamind and Spark.  Let us dwell on them a little more. <br><br>  <strong>Megamind</strong> <br>  <a href="http://megamozg.ru/">Megamind</a> is a separated part of Habr, I don‚Äôt fully understand the audience of the project, but there is more traffic compared to Spark.  Our articles here are gaining an average of 2,000 to 5,000 views, which is not bad enough.  Below is a comparison of sites for traffic. <br><br>  <strong>Spark</strong> <br>  <a href="http://spark.ru/">Spark</a> is a place where startups for startups publish content (a lot of translation) and their news.  It feels like the audience here is smaller, and our articles sometimes gain only 150 views.  Which is extremely small.  Although there were articles that gained 3000-4000 views.  Also, it‚Äôs not completely clear how articles get into ‚ÄúPopular‚Äù and email-list with the best articles. <br><br>  Well, it is much easier to wind up / merge articles on Spark, since this requires only registration, while on Megamind, registration is only by invite and far from everyone can vote. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/33c/66a/4f2/33c66a4f2d9545f1934973cdf6316bee.jpg" width="100%"><br><br>  BUT!  Oddly enough at the moment both resources have brought the <strong>same number of registrations</strong> .  For ourselves, we decided that we will attend both. <br><br><h3>  5. How do I write articles? </h3><br>  Once upon a time a teacher of Russian language and literature hardly drew me 4k.  But over the past 5 years, I have probably written hundreds of notes, posts, etc.  And if the first articles on Habr√© were given to me with great difficulty (I could spend one week on one post and rewrite it several times), now everything is much simpler. <br><br>  I usually write stuff on weekends or in the evening before bedtime.  Immediately never publish it.  Then after a couple of days I return to it, make small adjustments, delete something or, on the contrary, supplement it.  So on average for 2 visits and from 4 to 10 hours of the total time you get a post. <br><br>  There are usually more topics for posts than the ability to write them all.  Sometimes readers in comments or in personal messages are asked to tell something.  Sometimes I read something interesting from others and share my experience on this topic, sometimes interesting events happen and talk about them in a blog.  I always write down all the ideas and look at them before the next note. <br><br>  For example, the project began to receive <strong>first payments from customers</strong> - an excellent opportunity to tell you more about this significant event for any startup (this will be the next note, subscribe to the blog, so as not to miss). <br><br><h3>  Instead of conclusion </h3><br>  What else to say about the blog?  Personally, he allows me to meet many new and interesting people.  Get thanks for the article (motivates to write further) and questions on the development of their projects.  Therefore, if your project does not yet have a blog (on the website, on Youtube or here), be sure to think about this opportunity.  Successes, friends! </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/292366/">https://habr.com/ru/post/292366/</a></p>
