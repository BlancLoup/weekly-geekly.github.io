And the saddest thing here is that it is a system.  Anyone who goes to study (and there are still those who follow a diploma or simply do not want to join the army), is ‚Äúformed‚Äù for several years and comprehends in his own skin the whole dullness of the system, which is not aimed at giving a meaningful understanding of subjects and arouse interest, and to run through a template program, a step to the side - execution.  Wrote a resident interrupt interceptor on the asm?  Well, well, let's better show me HelloWorld first, then we'll talk. <br><br>  The funny thing is that students see the problem from the inside, they can offer sound solutions, but who will listen to them?  If the teacher says one thing, and the modern world experience - another, then the rights are usually taught by  Just because, in fact, your assessment depends on his subjective opinion, so in order to be an excellent student, it is better not to bother with all this nonsense, and live in a little world about which the teacher tells, and firmly believe all that garbage he carries.  I know that there are people to whom what has been said above has nothing to do, please do not be offended :)

      That student disaccustomed, received his unhappy diploma and went into adulthood.  Let us even assume that he has become a big man, can influence politics, and even the sphere of education.  Only he doesn‚Äôt need this, he has his own life, his own problems, and trying to be an honest politician is a laudable thing, but ungrateful and unprofitable.  Usually, by this time, the memories of education sound like ‚ÄúI passed - and thank the eggs, God forbid, repeat it again.‚Äù  Viscous system, which even the top is almost impossible to influence. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Suppose a person is still obsessed with the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãimproving education, and now he is going to promote this idea.  What does he meet?  He meets the old farts, holding their chairs, and not recognizing any changes - the more stable the better, the stronger the ass will hold in the chair.  For them, any changes are a risk, because they were not just planted in these chairs, but that they were responsible for certain activities.  Less activity - less responsibility.  And then a young upstart climbs with delusional ideas - but who is he at all?  Here we have been sitting here for how many years, experienced people, tea knows better than him what to do. <br><br>  Let's say this person managed to push a sensible idea upstairs, infecting a couple of people with an enthusiastic infection, bribing a couple of dozen people and threatening to cruelly cut out the whole family from a couple of hundred more.  They accepted the idea, and began to descend on instances.  And she got in the form of an order to some uni.  And in the university, too, sit old guys and aunts - the longer they sit the stronger, because they have been sitting for so long.  They care - know yourself drank state funding, but cut the loot from the pay.  Universals perform their formal functions no more than the necessary minimum, well, plus sometimes they allocate loot to try pathos with other universes.  But for teachers' salaries - shish.  And where will qualified professionals come from, ready to train students?  So there are those who already have everything, and they teach for ideological reasons (there are few of them), as well as those who are too stupid to work in their field, so that only a job as a teacher for a penny salary remains. <br><br>  Why do people still go to college?  Yes, because de facto they have a monopoly. <br><br>  <i>A diploma is your pass to the big world, without a diploma you are nobody, a serious organization will not accept you.</i> <br><br>  And this is despite the fact that there are commercial educational institutions that teach the actual things in which adequate people sit and give high-quality knowledge.  Only here the ‚Äúdiploma‚Äù of such an institution, in most cases, is no more valuable than the paper on which it is printed, no one will take it seriously. <br><br>  <b>But times are changing.</b> <br><br>  Less and less companies pay attention to the diploma when applying for a job, they are only interested in what a person really knows.  And if you are at least three times a graduate, if you do not have the necessary skills to work and bring income to the company, you are not needed. <br><br>  <i>Knowledge is your pass to the big world, without knowledge you are no one, a serious organization will not accept you.</i> <br><br>  And they all shit on your diplomas.  Because at the origins of these organizations there are more and more people like you who have passed through our institutions (in whole or in part), and now they don‚Äôt put these diplomas into anything. <br><br>  My mother told me: study well at school, go to the institute, get his diploma, and your life will be wonderful. <br>  But everything goes to the fact that diplomas completely lose their value.  And then the parents will send their children not to where the diploma is better, but to the place where they teach better, and these will not be institutions at all.  Institutes will lose their degree monopoly, fewer people will go there.  Accordingly, less dough with pay.  Of course, state funding will remain, but will you really live on it?  Yes, and authority shakes.  It was then that the old guys finally tear their asses off the chairs, scratch them, and start thinking what to do.  Because before it was like: if you don‚Äôt change anything, then everything is fine; if you change something, there is a risk.  And now, if you change something, the risk is still the same.  But if nothing is changed, then absolutely everything will end sadly. <br><br>  It looks like naive nonsense, but I want to believe in change for the better. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/81816/">https://habr.com/ru/post/81816/</a></p>
