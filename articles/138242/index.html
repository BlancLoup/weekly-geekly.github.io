  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Only Ruby, only hardcore!</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"> Early in the morning (or late at night) on January 9, I arrived at Sheremetyevo Airport to meet <b>Josh Calderimis</b> from Travis-CI.  The printed name plate stayed at home, but by luck, we met Josh almost immediately and his first phrase was: " <i>Toster? I am hungry, did you get toasts?</i> ".  Not to say that this question, asked with a smile on my face, put me in a dead end, but I did not expect that all the remaining days of stay in snow-covered Moscow, the guys would come up with more and more new jokes about the toaster and toast. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/00a/862/6a6/00a8626a6256da12d4aeb19481748b3c.jpg"><br><br>  By the way, we apologize for their absence at the last conference, everything is simple - they were eaten by the speakers before the presentation. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  With <b>Gregg Pollak</b> from Envy Labs it turned out no less funny - having met him a bit later, we successfully traveled around all the ‚Äúfamous traffic jams‚Äù and instead of checking at the hotel he asked to ride him around the city.  As an excursion, we decided to visit the city of Dzerzhinsky, where Gregg was most interested in the Nikolo-Ugreshsky Monastery.  Despite the severe frosts, we managed to feed the geese-swans, who live in large numbers on the territory.

Show us. <br><br>  After short magical passes with their hands, everyone was packed and ready to leave the airport.  However, until the very departure, the guys with great difficulty moved through the fresh air, as in their edges the temperature in winter rarely drops below 20 degrees Celsius - forgetting to see the weather forecast, these desperate guys came almost in T-shirts and shorts. <br><br>  But the most important thing is that the absence of toast and morning coffee did not prevent us from organizing an excellent event on Friday. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/0e7/dc3/2df/0e7dc32df2ae860a6f0d87e621773877.jpg"><br><br>  Half an hour before the start of registration, we found a fairly large number of people waiting for it to start - it instilled confidence and hope that not a single report would remain unheard, although we had several technical breaks during the conference. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/a25/8a9/c48/a258a9c48f5d0c2fb8df9c87bf8b20a9.jpg"><br><br>  Gregg‚Äôs speech was first in the program (which he was very pleased with, as he had promised many technical things that would have been much worse after dinner) - he quickly took matters into his own hands and started telling conference participants about code changes in Rails 3 core. I did not miss - the audience literally woke up, perceived all his words, with which he described the new techniques of use. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/0f3/0a6/570/0f30a65708c246d1a66e1cece6f14d67.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/6a2/597/3e1/6a25973e13aea56f7a2ec1803f0f96b7.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/ed4/f93/3d1/ed4f933d171a3fef6a6246cdbfe22008.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/57b/4fc/2e0/57b4fc2e00e91a3f3f4abc9d22d943f5.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/2c9/829/43b/2c982943bf50b1a2908010e657dbc896.jpg"><br><br>  The second to the stage was Fabiu Akita, a speaker from faraway Brazil, who began to talk about various scaling techniques for highly dynamic and interactive Rails applications. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/4d8/a48/4c5/4d8a484c59a4eade45973fa32dadc8d3.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/a40/e52/b38/a40e52b38229c3d55f2ff74c0cd4926e.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/6bf/96b/8b7/6bf96b8b776369ae3a4c899ae304be3f.jpg"><br><br>  Many participants were waiting for his performances, as Fabiu is one of the most famous and prominent ‚Äúengines‚Äù of the Rails community in South America and before the start of the conference it was obvious that the topic of application scaling would be highly demanded. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/02f/1aa/837/02f1aa837f0b93764210427bcd668607.jpg"><br><br>  <b>Ivan Evtukhovich</b> came on the scene with a great mood and with a no less prominent report - on how <b>Evil Martians</b> (to whom we say a huge thank you for helping us in forming the conference program) prepared the Russian Groupon.  Such a conversation (in the key of Rails) was heard for the first time in Russia, and therefore listening to the first report and watching slides in Russian was doubly interesting - until Ivan, no one had ever talked about organizing work in such a popular and voluminous Rails projects from the Moscow stage. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/5f9/712/df9/5f9712df94c2566556f8d1d08b88f367.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/178/171/92f/17817192f04326ac5d3bfd9877e0ba3e.jpg"><br><br>  Finally, the last (before lunch) report was devoted to JRuby practices ‚Äî despite the burned down converter and the inability to display slides on the big screen, <b>Timofey Klimenko</b> from HotSpot was able to talk about several interesting points about using JRuby and the JVM platform as a whole. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/d76/2c5/4e8/d762c54e81c699ff3f11473abd0ffda0.jpg"><br><br>  Simultaneous translation worked at the conference (foreign speakers were translated into Russian, Russian reports were translated into English) - Douglas Kampos, speaking last but one, noted that there were very interesting moments in the speech of Timofey, which he himself was going to talk about. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/792/125/ebf/792125ebfbc560c55e19494b0fd15d1d.jpg"><br><br>  Then there was a <s>two-course</s> dinner <s>(the third course for all participants was again eaten by the speakers)))</s> - a good opportunity to communicate with colleagues. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/1e5/b98/641/1e5b98641c07f743610fdabf36ecfdae.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/d57/e81/09f/d57e8109f797ebd0a9d97a73d117841e.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/fff/123/3fa/fff1233fac024317e009e03d2ae0f71f.jpg"><br><br>  Maybe dinner really didn‚Äôt meet someone‚Äôs expectations, but you also understand - we don‚Äôt cook ourselves) Anyway, a toaster is first of all not a pupil, but knowledge and the opportunity to communicate with well-known speakers: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/f7e/48e/08a/f7e48e08a35766e3ceb72b220bcd2a79.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/ee0/22f/b94/ee022fb94b9d9e76bb738d35f1fad96b.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/699/df9/c59/699df9c59c82ce183124a104fabffa1f.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/142/708/aaf/142708aaf5d451ccdf8542c0729c3550.jpg"><br><br>  And just chat <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/84c/044/984/84c04498414ac6f07ea411b8fc446ca8.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/d6c/aea/615/d6caea6159cfedb699ff02dc34443480.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/9aa/f93/4df/9aaf934df8541ff2a52ca7e587a26a44.jpg"><br><br>  Increased concentration of gray sweatshirts: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/e33/4c3/7e3/e334c37e31dfbf5e7ece369016b7906a.jpg"><br><br>  During the conference, the lounge area was open all the time, where you could lie on ottomans and chat with friends.  Thanks to the company Reg.ru, who fed popcorn and fed with cola! <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/d7a/5c2/e41/d7a5c2e41de54c893f94a2d6bfb6f540.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/29b/9f7/45b/29b9f745bcebfc489ae5464de641896b.jpg"><br><br>  After lunch, we had the honor to contemplate <b>Konstantin Haze</b> , who could not attend live because of the visa, but this did not prevent him from carrying out a meaningful report on the history of Sinatra, how it was created and what future this wonderful project awaits. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/01a/b20/997/01ab20997cee661502fe9edb298d22cb.jpg"><br><br>  One of the most prominent reports was with Joshua Calderimis: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/0aa/403/f56/0aa403f56e43172fc0dc8eab2885a354.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/a34/66e/1d6/a3466e1d60b18e2dee22ae03dafcbd6c.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/7d0/b36/675/7d0b36675b6cf6f5409e46a6fc64500c.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/80a/b26/ee8/80ab26ee8ef3a7ea34f8ca79c6a5cba8.jpg"><br><br>  Josh became the star of the {ruby} conference. Toaster - it immediately became clear that he intended not only to tell interesting details (concerning the Travis CI), but also to arrange a small show, lifting the entire hall to its feet. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/81b/3c5/215/81b3c5215e3a7303ab86a8461d94c8be.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/355/4f7/5a3/3554f75a3e07dd013610c926edff03c7.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/7ad/e94/9b8/7ade949b8f3e00b75d8cc5aced01f99c.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/d56/0b0/ba8/d560b0ba810bfcd0b01963c6046b92ae.jpg"><br><br>  The branded shirt, smile and gorgeous slides on the napkins are clearly remembered by everyone for a long time, as well as the way in which it is most convenient to break a large product into its component parts, controlling it in this form. <br><br>  Douglas Campos, tired after the flight and not having time to sleep at night because of the time difference, rested during the reports of his colleagues ... <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/cbf/828/191/cbf828191f52623d349473b77815b24c.jpg"><br><br>  ... but when it was his turn to go on stage and talk about JRuby, he was clearly animated.  Coming out with a microphone, he literally began to bomb the hall with his short and energetic phrases - I think, after Douglas's words, many again believed that JRuby is convenient, fast and efficient, that it should be used as a replacement for MRI. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/074/c8f/5f0/074c8f5f0b8380776e766c9d0c6a5603.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/99a/ba3/dd5/99aba3dd59116e0c694c114e4db4a9f9.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/32f/c83/fcb/32fc83fcbbb8050e1fb53839dbba0b01.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/426/c28/7a7/426c287a7c9e73d3cb050c711de7e9d9.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/1af/521/c57/1af521c5726358aa3a556b13f08dc1b1.jpg"><br><br>  Finally, the youngest speaker, <b>Jonathan Leighton</b> , who is now only 22 years old and he counts the days until the next birthday, told about Active Record, to which he was directly involved as a member of the Rails Core team.  John is a budding young man who went to get higher education only because ‚Äúit helps to understand some mathematical and logical problems better and is otherwise useless‚Äù :) Of course, from his side it was a joke with some truth, but John actually makes an impression beyond the years of a wise specialist who will soon take the place of the CTO of a London startup.  But I promised him not to disclose the details, so I have to keep my word. <br><br>  At the end of the conference, there was a traditional prize draw - this time, in addition to gadgets from Yota and tickets to the next one. Toaster, we played branded Habramayk and our new board game ‚Äú <b><a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/mosigra/blog/135373/">Startup</a></b> ‚Äù: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/d2d/b0b/7fd/d2db0b7fd0158071e2899e9589490894.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/e10/882/0cc/e108820cc13e27871bf8b61db3cacbe7.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/9cc/cb7/94b/9cccb794bb1f240adee03fedb500cf71.jpg"><br><br>  As a final note - afterparty: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/5b8/09c/45a/5b809c45a25a3dc735d27a57adadfdfd.jpg"><br><br>  We hope that you have a good impression of the conference. <b>Toaster {ruby}</b> - we will definitely make another Ruby conference, since now foreign guys are ready to help us. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/b2b/442/9df/b2b4429dfeabee1ee733e2a4872065a9.jpg"><br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/ZNC8HjnYULo%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700023,15700186,15700190,15700253,15700256,15700259&amp;usg=ALkJrhidsUcI3JxbZvOqDjKRmUvgM6U_0A" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  The next toaster will be dedicated to JS and will be held on Friday, April 13th - don't miss our showcore show. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/69c/3d7/4e0/69c3d74e032e91e46f855440d08b6005.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  PS Special thanks to the guys from <a href="http://evilmartians.com/">Evil Martians</a> for their help in preparing the conference program.
