Rip off covers - dominate. <br>  He tore off covers and remained anonymous - he solved both tasks and received a level-up. <br>  In some circles, the volume and frequency of solving both problems is the subject of ‚Äúlaying on the table and measuring‚Äù.

      But all this concerns such a self, "military anonymity." <br><br><h4>  Alternative varieties </h4><br>  What do we have in the segment of "civil" and "creative" anonymity? <br><br>  The centuries-old religious tradition of anonymity in Orthodoxy is to hide the frequency and volume of donations from the laity and clergy. <br><br>  ‚ÄúSo, when you are doing alms, do not trumpet before you, as the hypocrites do on the streets, so that people may glorify them. <br>  Verily I say unto you, they have received their reward. <br>  But when you do alms, do not let your left hand know what your right hand is doing.  That your alms be in secret;  and your Father who sees in secret will reward you openly. " <br>  Matthew's Gospel (ch. 6, v. 2-4) <br><br>  The feats of the Timurovs and other nameless heroes are widely known. <br>  Often, they become motives for anecdotes, but this is already a problem of another kind - the special love of a post-Soviet (and Western or Eastern) person to ridicule everything, the true value and complexity of which he simply cannot understand. <br><br>  In the everyday sense, anonymity and a temporary ‚Äúsecret cover‚Äù are the main element of surprise preparation. <br>  Everyone understands that if something becomes known - it ceases to be a surprise for the addressee. <br><br><h4>  Life illustrations </h4><br>  A simple example of creative anonymity. <br>  I want to give my wife a gift of something that she had long dreamed of. <br>  What exactly is this dream is unknown. <br>  You can simply and pragmatically tell her about your plans and ask what she wants. <br>  And the wife will be happy with such plans and gifts. <br>  But there will be no surprise. <br><br>  You can spend "soft intelligence" and roughly assume what a person dreams. <br>  Then buy it, donate and ... find out that it is "almost, but not quite what you need." <br><br>  ‚ÄúCreative anonymity‚Äù in such a situation is what is needed. <br>  After the "soft intelligence" you just need to find a way to anonymously ask whether it was decided to give the gift? <br><br><h4>  Advanced anonymity functionality </h4><br>  Anonymity allows you to go even further. <br>  For example, to compile a large list of various gift options and show them to his wife so that she can mark which ones they like and which ones don‚Äôt. <br>  Who asked - is unknown.  Hence, the gift will be or not - is also unknown.  And from whom he can be - only speculation can also be there. <br><br>  As a result, anonymity was able to solve the problem of intelligence and kept the surprise. <br><br><h4>  Tools for creative anonymity </h4><br>  Any modern communication channels can become a clarification tool. <br>  But the main thing here is not to ask a question, but to get an answer. <br><br>  To e-mail from a stranger, writing the answer is long and lazy. <br>  A phone call from a stranger will lead to zero frankness. <br>  Messengers will require authorization. <br><br>  An attempt to solve this problem took my team. <br>  We made an Internet service based on a simple mechanic ‚Äî show the list of gifts without specifying who made this list. <br><br>  We called it - Active Gift <br>  (as opposed to other tools with a passive ideology - various wish-lists). <br><br>  In order for the Donor to receive the recipient's response through the Active Gift - you do not need to write anything. <br>  You just need to click the ‚ÄúLike‚Äù or ‚ÄúDislike‚Äù button near each item in the list. <br><br>  Why would the recipient of such a list press this button? <br>  Just.  That's why people click the Like button on Facebook. <br>  That is, "for fun." <br>  Just for fun. <br>  After all, there is no risk. <br><br>  And for the Donor, this is the most valuable information that will help him to present a good, necessary, desired and accurate gift. <br><br>  This is our creative anonymity. <br>  What do you think about our approach? <br>  I would be happy to comment. <br><br>  Thank you for reading to the end :) <br><br>  <a href="http://www.activegift.me/%3Futm_source%3Dpost_20111222_Realnyj_mir_i_problema_anonimnosti%26utm_medium%3Dsmm-link%26utm_campaign%3DHabr">Try Active Gift now &gt;&gt;&gt;</a> <br>  (registration is not needed - login through Facebook works). </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/135115/">https://habr.com/ru/post/135115/</a></p>
