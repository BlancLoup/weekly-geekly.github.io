All of them are great, well done guys in general: the extremely high attendance, and the complexity of the infrastructure, and the technologies used, but in the world they are not so popular.  This is also the case of most lovers in China, from those whose eyes are directed to California, where <a href="http://blog.minming.net/post/35553963889/a-billion-dollar-software-tech-company-is-founded-every">a hitech company worth a billion dollars appears</a> every 3 months, in the picture of the world is simply missing.  This country is in many ways, where it comes to quantity, unusual, constantly because of the rumor of the city of China, metro, bridges, ports;  so here I am - about massive Chinese sites.  Comparing with DDOS as an attack is stupid, it is completely different and it is not commonplace, but there are sites where the infrastructure is sharpened for millions, if only for the reason that they seemed interesting to me. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h4>  baidu.com </h4><br>  The leader not only of the Chinese Internet, but also of the <a href="">world</a> (although by some numerical indicators it is almost synonymous), Baidu is right behind Google, Facebook, Youtube and Yahoo.  Baidu is an internal replacement for Google, and search and many, many other services from maps and wikipedia to Google Drive (and yes, it has its fork Chromium and Android). <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/55a/64f/0f5/55a64f0f54efcba0af4f049129813191.jpeg"><br>  <i>And this is the fourth generation of Baidu Maps, for example</i> <br><br>  The Chinese Internet is about to have half the population, with about 600 million users online, according to various sources.  With the help of Baidu, the vast majority of this audience is looking for ( <a href="">83%</a> ), which translates into $ 500 million in net profit <a href="http://ir.baidu.com/phoenix.zhtml%3Fc%3D188488%26p%3Dirol-newsArticle%26ID%3D1751298%26highlight%3D">in Q3 2012</a> and sixteen thousand employees in the state.  And the brand has all sorts of beautiful offices, conferences and its own skyscraper, planned for 2015.

Even if we take the fact that Baidu has no competitors due to the peculiarities of the country, it is obvious that it simply could not function with so many users without using and not using the best practices.  You can't just hire and hire one hundred thousand Chinese to serve a lot of http requests. <br><br>  For example, the <a href="http://www.datacenterdynamics.com/focus/archive/2012/08/china-data-center-roundup-big-cloud-news-big-cloud-players">new</a> Baidu <a href="http://www.datacenterdynamics.com/focus/archive/2012/08/china-data-center-roundup-big-cloud-news-big-cloud-players">data center</a> is one of the largest in the world (by the amount of 1.6 billion investments).  700,000 CPUs on 120 thousand square meters.  It <a href="http://www.datacenterdynamics.com/focus/archive/2012/05/open-compute-merge-facebook%25E2%2580%2599s-custom-rack-specs-baidu%25E2%2580%2599s">will be</a> built on the infrastructure of opencompute.org, born on Facebook.  But even now they have hundreds of data centers and CDN nodes throughout China to serve billions of queries. <br><br>  On such CDNs, as usual, any statics, <a href="http://tangram.baidu.com/magic/">tangram.js</a> for example ‚Äî jquery-like javascript library for frontend development, ‚Äúefficient and reliable‚Äù is spinning.  And just like jquery has jquery UI, so there is <a href="http://tangram.baidu.com/magic/">Magic</a> .  And the tangram from the examples looks familiar, and it is clear why the style of the well-known API is borrowed: <br><br><pre><code class="javascript hljs"><span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-keyword"><span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-keyword">function</span></span></span><span class="hljs-function"> </span><span class="hljs-title"><span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-title">request</span></span></span><span class="hljs-function">(</span><span class="hljs-params"></span><span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-params"></span>) </span></span>{ baidu.ajax({ <span class="hljs-attr"><span class="hljs-attr">url</span></span>: <span class="hljs-string"><span class="hljs-string">'../../demos/baidu.ajax()/sleep.php'</span></span>, <span class="hljs-attr"><span class="hljs-attr">type</span></span>: <span class="hljs-string"><span class="hljs-string">'POST'</span></span>, <span class="hljs-attr"><span class="hljs-attr">data</span></span>: { <span class="hljs-attr"><span class="hljs-attr">time</span></span>: baidu.dom(<span class="hljs-string"><span class="hljs-string">'#sleep-time'</span></span>).val() }, <span class="hljs-attr"><span class="hljs-attr">async</span></span>: baidu.dom(<span class="hljs-string"><span class="hljs-string">'#chk-async'</span></span>).attr(<span class="hljs-string"><span class="hljs-string">'checked'</span></span>) === <span class="hljs-string"><span class="hljs-string">'checked'</span></span>, <span class="hljs-attr"><span class="hljs-attr">success</span></span>: <span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-keyword"><span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-keyword">function</span></span></span><span class="hljs-function">(</span><span class="hljs-params"><span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-params">responseText</span></span></span><span class="hljs-function">)</span></span>{ baidu.dom(<span class="hljs-string"><span class="hljs-string">'#status'</span></span>).html(responseText); } }); } baidu.dom(<span class="hljs-string"><span class="hljs-string">'#request'</span></span>).on(<span class="hljs-string"><span class="hljs-string">'click'</span></span>, <span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-keyword"><span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-keyword">function</span></span></span><span class="hljs-function">(</span><span class="hljs-params"></span><span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-params"></span>)</span></span>{ baidu.dom(<span class="hljs-string"><span class="hljs-string">'#status'</span></span>).html(<span class="hljs-string"><span class="hljs-string">'...'</span></span>);setTimeout(request, <span class="hljs-number"><span class="hljs-number">50</span></span>);});</code> </pre> <br><br>  Baidu search giant first.  He <a href="http://www.hypertable.org/pr/BaiduSponsorship.html">sponsors</a> HyperTable distributed storage, a BigTable clone.  It is argued that HyperTable is significantly <a href="http://hypertable.com/why_hypertable/hypertable_vs_hbase_2/">faster than</a> HBase II on all tests, except for random reading uniformly distributed keys (the random read uniform test), where they are equal. <br><br><h4>  taobao.com </h4><br>  Chinese Amazon, although so far inferior in the <a href="http://www.alexa.com/topsites">Alexa Top Sites</a> list to the original one position (# 11), but with strictly positive dynamics.  Half a billion registered users, 213 million of whom visited taobao.com network within 24 hours.  Imagine what an online store is: it‚Äôs a lot of static, a page with dozens of images ( <a href="http://yilaishenshou90hou.taobao.com/%3Fspm%3D0.0.0.168.9VnuHK">like this one</a> ), user sessions, ordering and ordering processes, recommendation algorithms.  November 11 on the site of this network tmall.com was a sale, which recorded <a href="http://westiseast.co.uk/blog/taobao-sales-19-billion-bonanza/">10 million visitors</a> who came in the first minute, bought goods worth $ 3 billion a day.  All this statistics, by the way, was posted to the Chinese equivalent of Twitter, weibo, in the form of infographics, which is <a href="http%25253A%25252F%25252Fwww.weibo.com%25252Fu%25252F1748121853">very funny</a> . <br><br><table><tbody><tr><td><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/96f/534/aab/96f534aab9bf2aae55bf379c0ff4d0dd.jpg"><br></td></tr><tr><td align="center">  <i>PHP on the main page <a href="http://www.taobao.com/index_global.php">again</a> , <a href="http://www.taobao.com/index_global.php">www.taobao.com/index_global.php</a></i> <br></td></tr></tbody></table><br><br>  However, php is only on the front end.  Business logic is written in Java and seems to be partially in Lua (otherwise, why the ngx_lua module).  The code of many things is open <a href="http://code.taobao.org/">code.taobao.org</a> and can be seen as connected with one another. <br><br>  Taobao has a very interesting open source web server - <a href="http://tengine.taobao.org/">tengine</a> .  For example, there is dynamic loading of modules without restarting the server, the built-in firewall, ngx_lua, static concatenation <a href="http-concat">nginx-http-concat</a> (sometime <a href="https://github.com/pagespeed/ngx_pagespeed">ngx_pagespeed</a> will come out of alpha).  Or distributed file system <a href="http://code.taobao.org/p/tfs/src/">TFS</a> (as usual in the same cases high availability, high performance and low cost), also available under GPL 2.0.  In README, the svn repository even suggests joining the development. <br><br>  In 2010, search giant Baidu and Japanese Rakuten <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2010/01/27/baidu-rakuten/">invested $ 50 million</a> .  to its giant online mall, but, unable to withstand the competition, in 2012 it was <a href="http://www.marketing-interactive.com/news/32430">closed</a> . <br><br><h4>  weibo.com </h4><br><br>  Already a cult, the Chinese equivalent of Twitter, which by the way even surpasses its American counterpart in some way.  The recent peak of Twitter during the elections was <a href="http://blog.twitter.com/2012/11/election-night-2012.html">327,452 messages per minute</a> , weibo.com at the beginning of the new 2012 had <a href="http://www.donews.com/net/201201/1073641.shtm">481.207</a> .  Generally speaking, Weibo stands for microblogging and in China, in addition to Sina Weibo itself (http://weibo.com), there are Tencent Weibo (http://t.qq.com/) and Netease (http://163.com) .  And these are not just copies, each project has a very large audience, according to the <a href="http://www.techinasia.com/netease-weibo-260-million-users-numbers/">total number of registered users</a> , Sina has 368 million, Tencent has 469, and Netease Weibo has 200 million. The daily active audience is about ten times less.  Twitter is more with some reservations - 500M + users, of which 170M are active ( <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/07/31/twitter-may-have-500m-users-but-only-170m-are-active-75-on-twitters-own-clients/">techcrunch</a> ). <br><br>  In China, apparently there are very few hipsters, academic and geeks, but a lot of different php.  For example, one of the leading developers of the PHP core team has <a href="http://www.venturedata.org/%3Fi440286_PHP-only-Chinese-official-team-has-joined-Sina-microblogging-worked-at-Baidu">moved</a> from Baidu to Sina Weibo. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/b4d/5ca/040/b4d5ca040b462a4d61f72356941b4422.png"><br>  <i>Fresh October Sina Weibo redesign</i> <br><br>  Sina Weibo is not only rich in user experience, but also fairly modern in technology.  According to a blog from another developer (http://timyang.net/), the first version of weibo was completely built on the standard LAMP stack (MyISAM).  The second has already been architecturally divided into several layers, used asynchronous messages, memcachedq, innodb in MySQL.  Later weibo begins to use Redis, Percona in large quantities, drop processing, for each of the layers its own api, many-many subtleties are presented in the presentation, for example in json-serialization in java, benchmarks.  But the fifth version is on the way.  The presentations from <a href="http://www.qconbeijing.com/2011/">www.qconbeijing.com/2011 are</a> difficult to understand, although I really want to, because they are in Chinese and do not translate into English as easily as regular pages. <br><br><h4>  qq.com </h4><br><br>  Tencent in Alexa ranking, one of the most visited Internet portals of China belongs to Tencent Holdings.  Peak simultaneously connected to QQ Messenger users more than <a href="http://www.techxav.com/2010/03/07/qq-msn/">100 million users</a> (Skype in October reached only <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/10/14/skype-reaches-a-45m-concurrent-user-peak-and-what-looks-like-a-new-stage-of-momentum/">45M</a> ).  The QQ protocol is closed, but reverse engineering solves, so support is available in many messengers.  Moreover, 30 million users of QQ-services - <a href="http://www.techinasia.com/qq-proud-paying-members/">users with paid accounts</a> . <br><br>  Tencent, as mentioned above, also has the largest by number of users similar to Twitter, or, for example, PaiPai.com - similar to ebay auction. <br><br>  Qzone.qq.com is simply amazing.  This is 700 million social network.  <a href="http://thenextweb.com/asia/2012/08/09/picture-this-chinese-internet-giant-tencents-qzone-social-network-now-hosts-over-150-billion-photos/">200-300 million photos</a> per day are loaded into it, half of which via a mobile client.  Indicators are comparable to Facebook. <br><br><h4>  youku.com, renren, kaixin and others </h4><br><br>  youku.com is a replacement for Youtube.  Both Baidu and Tencent have their own services.  Each <a href="http://www.techinasia.com/china-web-video-sites-comscore-august-2012/">has several hundred million</a> views in August, but Youku is still the largest.  He has a weekly audience <a href="http://www.techinasia.com/youku-tudou-310-million-weekly-unique-viewers-16-billion-hours-video-month/">of 310 million unique visitors</a> (Youtube has a monthly audience of <a href="http://www.youtube.com/t/press_statistics">800M</a> ). <br><br>  It is clear that whatever the site does not occupy a niche, if it is at the top, it automatically means millions of users.  I really hope someone will add more specifics - due to what the Chinese make sites that can withstand the exorbitant load, only because of their mentality?  and why in the world about them so little talk. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/158591/">https://habr.com/ru/post/158591/</a></p>
