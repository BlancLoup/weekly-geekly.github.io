And the Cyborg's Heart Beats</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Dear readers, in front of you is the first chapter of the story, in the plot of which such diverse themes as organic immortality, the colonization of Mars, the Amish and the very interesting domestic computer EC1863 will be organically interwoven.  How?  Do not try to guess, do not guess for anything.  See for yourself as you slowly lay out new chapters. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/oz/k5/nw/ozk5nwdr2loo9jbxnyj0stoszo0.jpeg"><br><br>  The collector of switches and sockets Tonya, listening to Radio VOS, drew attention to an unusual announcement.  A certain organization invites people who have recently been blinded to the neurophysiology experiment.  This is her case.  Intuition suggested that ads on such <br>  you can trust the radio station, and Tonya dialed the number.

      She agreed that she would be picked up by car on Friday after work by a representative of the organization.  And here it is - in the cabin, judging by the sound, obviously an electric car.  Hardly "Tesla", probably, "Leaf".  But it is not important. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  The office smelled pleasantly of coffee.  A specialist asked a guest: <br><br>  - Recently blind? <br><br>  - Yes.  It happened‚Ä¶ <br><br>  - The main thing recently.  Are you familiar with neuroplasticity? <br><br>  - Of course.  For example, in blind dogs the sense of smell is aggravated, and in people - sense of touch, hearing. <br><br>  - A great example.  At one time, the blind helped the air defense of besieged Leningrad perfectly.  And a person who has recently been blinded has a visual cortex, whose enormous computational power is not involved in any way.  Not yet involved. <br><br>  - And you want to organize something like GPU calculations on it? <br><br>  - You are late to participate in our experiment.  Your neuroplasticity is already irreversibly moving towards telepathy.  Just kidding <br><br>  - What are you, it's easy to guess.  Okay, implant me a neural interface. <br><br>  ... <br><br>  - Tonya, congratulations, all three operations were successful.  And on the heart, and on the neck, and on the visual cortex. <br><br>  - On the heart?  And on the neck? <br><br>  - For your visual cortex is a fierce struggle.  The rest of the brain tends to gradually grab it for their needs.  To avoid this, it must solve some problems continuously.  So feeding a neural interface through something like Qi is not an option.  That, that, forgot to include, well, you understand.  It needs to work without any service around the clock.  And the heart ... you were told at school why it knocks, although soft? <br><br>  - I do remember.  It knocks on the chest. <br><br>  - That's it.  Amplitude rather big.  Here we are, as in the famous song, and implanted a magnet right into the heart.  A stationary winding was placed nearby.  And they passed through the neck a cable in a biologically inert sheath. <br><br>  - Goodbye, gymnastics for the neck? <br><br>  - What are you, what are you.  Four "squares", reserve hoo, what will he do? <br>  You can even shake your head from side to side. <br><br>  - Yes, I look now, probably ... <br><br>  - You look the same.  The stitches are barely noticeable, sorry, I can't show it to you.  Yes, and more.  At any time, the neural interface can be checked with the built-in test utility.  The idea is taken from Rain Man.  Try multiplying a couple of eight-digit numbers in your mind. <br><br>  - Oh, it turned out.  And if you share? <br><br>  - You can not.  Only multiplication.  The utility is simplified to the limit.  KISS principle.  Well, ahead of the weekend, now we will go to the first test of our invention.  Today will be a competition between several autopilot developers.  We will get serious <br>  advantage: we have you, participants in the experiment. <br><br>  - I agree.  By the way, do you have Leaf? <br><br>  - Let's go to ‚Äúyou‚Äù.  By the way, I'm Peter.  I have a samopal.  But the details of the "Lif" in it.  Only in the competition, we do not apply it.  Because fifteen participants will fit only in Iveco Daily, which we bought on the cheap from Transavtolysis.  Instead of the rear row of chairs, we installed equipment for communicating with neural interfaces.  Fifteen people with live co-processors on one chest of silicon!  Well, I'll be in the driver's seat.  The organizers of the competition will put a camera there, so as not to try to control.  You can only press the mushroom button if necessary, the rest is disqualification.  Well, you can sleep, or <br>  think about anything, or chat with a neighbor.  It does not affect the work of the visual cortex. <br><br>  ... <br><br>  - First place!  Tonya, you, probably, slammed, like competitors, some pieces of foam scattered?  And we have not.  It is the organizers of the scenery and mobile dummies recreated in the smallest details of the situation in which summed up the autopilot "Tesla". <br><br>  - But our autopilot, though better, is impractical? <br><br>  - Because the programmer wrote this opus in one evening with heavy libraries.  It will shrink - and you‚Äôll get fifteen, more effective ones instead of one autopilot. <br><br>  - Tell me, am I now considered a cyborg? <br><br>  - I guess, yes. <br><br>  - And the cyborg's heart beats.  So romantic! <br><br>  <i>Historical note: the character of Petit has a real prototype.</i>  <i>If he became an IT specialist and visits Habr, he will recognize himself by reading the next chapter.</i>  <i>Well, if you went to neurophysiology, you probably are laughing now, considering everything described as impossible.</i>  <i>But fiction does not tolerate too</i> <i><br></i>  <i>serious approach.</i> <br><br>  For now, everything, and in the next chapter we will transfer to 1993 and try to fit the EC1863 computer into the plot. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/446296/">https://habr.com/ru/post/446296/</a></p>
