The cherished date will come next Sunday ... <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  From December 1, a subscriber intending to retain the subscriber number may apply to <b>the recipient</b> <i>operator</i> ( <i>mobile operator, to the communication network of which the subscriber number is transferred</i> ) with a written statement about termination of the contract with the donor operator and the transfer of the subscriber number.
