  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Russia has become the absolute leader in the eSports market in Europe</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  <a href="https://www.superdataresearch.com/">SuperData Research</a> and <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/PayPal">PayPal</a> conducted a joint study of the European eSports market.  The European market for eSports as a whole is estimated at $ 300 million by SuperData Research, and the number of ‚ÄúeSports players‚Äù reaches 23 million. <br><br>  Experts of SuperData Research analyzed the transactions and the results of consumer surveys. <br><blockquote>  PayPal is engaged in e-sports research and sponsors the 2016 Grand Final of the Wargaming.net League, the largest e-sports competition in the World of Tanks game.  SuperData Research specializes in analyzing the market for computer games and e-sports. </blockquote>  According to the forecasts of researchers, by 2018 the market will grow to $ 389 million, and the audience - to 44.4 million.  The Russian eSports market is the largest both in terms of volume and number of cyber sportsmen - these figures reach $ 35.4 million and 2 million people, respectively. <br><br>  In second place is France, where the market volume is $ 22.5 million, in third place is Spain. <a name="habracut"></a>

      SuperData Research investigated data for Hungary, Greece, Italy, Spain, Poland, Russia, France and the Czech Republic.  According to PayPal and SuperData, most of the eSports fans are male (79% of men versus 21% of women).  The most common age groups are from 18 to 24 years old (30%) and from 25 to 34 years old (30%).  In Russia, a group of 18 to 24 years old has a larger share than the European average, 47%, according to Kommersant. <br><br>  The eSports industry attracts new advertisers from companies that previously used more traditional promotion channels, primarily TV.  According to SuperData Research, in 2015, the income of the eSports industry from sponsored advertising will exceed $ 570 million, which is only a third less than the similar income of NBA - the largest recipient of advertising budgets in sports. <br><br>  The authors of the study noted the growth of the mobile games audience in the eSports segment.  By the end of last year, the share of mobile games in this market in the United States exceeded 20%.  The most profitable gaming platforms in 2015 were (in descending order): Dota 2, League of Legends and Counter-Strike: Global Offensive. <br><br>  Recently it became known that Alisher Usmanov will build one of the world's largest cyber stadia.  On this April 4 <a href="http://www.rbc.ru/rbcfreenews/570282999a7947cb78926670">reported the</a> publication of RBC with reference to the company ESforce, which will be engaged in the construction of the arena.  Its area will exceed 5 thousand square meters, while the largest cyber stadiums in the United States occupy only 1.5 thousand square meters.  The tentative name of the building is Arena Moscow. <br><br>  In the fall of 2015, the billionaire invested a record $ 100 million in Russian eSports. <br><blockquote>  Cyber ‚Äã‚ÄãStadium - a platform for competitions in computer games.  ESforce Holding (formerly Virtus.pro Group) is one of the largest e-sports organizations in the world and the leader of Russian computer sports.  The company owns more than 180 popular Internet resources with an aggregate audience of 15 million subscribers and 40 million unique visitors per year. </blockquote><br>  Most professional cyber sportsmen have contracts with their organizations and can earn up to $ 20 thousand per month.  There are more such professionals than it may seem - they are in China, Korea, Europe, the USA, South America and, of course, in Russia. <br><br>  They are supported by large multigame organizations, which, in essence, are sports clubs that select suitable athletes to sign a contract.  In the end, cybersportsman is a part of the global business structure, which is necessary for making money, and is willing to pay for it. <br><br>  That is why there is no hard division between Russian and western tournaments - everything depends on the organizer, <a href="http://www.aif.ru/society/web/realnaya_virtualnost_chto_takoe_kibersport_kak_on_stal_populyarnee_hokkeya">concludes the</a> newspaper "Arguments and Facts".  Initially, the emblem of eSports was the phrase We are the world (‚ÄúWe are the world‚Äù) - there are no geographic references or boundaries. <br><br>  However, in the United States, for example, there are <a href="https://megamozg.ru/post/24554/">certain problems</a> with the legislation, which allows you to bet only on games in which the outcome of the match depends on the actual abilities of the players or teams.  Formulations that can be applied to almost any game and interpreted in any direction, prevents the market from developing. <br><br>  Nevertheless, business is ready to take risks, expecting huge profits, <a href="http://www.vestifinance.ru/articles/68678">writes the</a> publication Vesti Ekonomika.  Long-existing platforms, bookmakers, such as <a href="https://betway.com/ru/">Betway</a> , open special sections on their sites for eSports. <br><br>  Already there are super-popular start-ups-sweepstakes like <a href="https://unikrn.com/">Unikrn</a> , specializing exclusively in eSports.  This company raised $ 10 million in several rounds of investment.  The owner of the basketball club Dallas Mavericks and the star of the Shark Tank investment show Mark Kuban invested the lion's share of the money in the Unikrn tote. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/300026/">https://habr.com/ru/post/300026/</a></p>
