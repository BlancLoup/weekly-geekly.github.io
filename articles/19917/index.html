Taken <a href="http://www.brainfucking.ru/">from ¬© Yuda</a> <br><br>  I think you already have some idea of ‚Äã‚Äãhow our brain works.  Psychology often confirms our guesses about how the brain works, but at the same time presents many surprises.

      <strong>1. Your short-term memory is limited to seven tasks.</strong> <br><br>  Memory is divided into three types: sensory, long-term and short-term.  The principle of operation of a long-term memory resembles the work of a hard disk, and the short-term one - the operation of RAM.  At the same time, short-term memory can handle from 5 to 9 (on average 7) tasks.  Therefore, in order to quickly memorize information, try to break it into 7 blocks.  This is more convenient than straining long-term memory. <br><br>  <strong>2. Yellow-green color is the most noticeable.</strong> <br><br>  The eyes have receptors for detecting blue, green, and red.  Yellow-green is located right in the center of the frequency of visible light, thus making most of these receptors work, resulting in it being easier to notice than any other color.  It is useful to know the designers and marketers, because with this you can focus on something specific. <br><br>  <strong>3. Your subconscious is smarter than you.</strong> <br><br>  Or at least more powerful.  For one study, a computer, according to a complex algorithm, displayed a certain square on a certain area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe screen.  Subconsciously, people in 90% correctly guessed an approximate area in which the square would be next time, but when they were asked to argue their assumption, they found it difficult and, often, changed their correct decision to the wrong one.  By the way, we often call this ‚Äúrandom‚Äù guessing intuition, and give it some mystical meaning.  In fact, it is quite a familiar and reliable way of making decisions.  The subconscious knows more than we think faster, you just need to be able to understand what it says. <br><br>  <strong>4. There are two types of nervous system.</strong> <br><br>  One of them controls the arousal, and the other - inhibition.  Surely, you sometimes notice that your hands shake involuntarily (meaning cases not related to anxiety or intoxication).  This is caused by the minor random differences of these systems. <br><br>  <strong>5. In fact, our memory has a rather modest scope.</strong> <br><br>  Studies have shown that people often do not remember the latest events.  Therefore, to recollect again what happened to us is a rather useful exercise.  It is advisable to do this in the evening before bedtime (you can lie in bed), trying to restore the entire sequence of events of the past day and in as much detail as possible.  In time, memories will become brighter and more detailed.  It also contributes to the effectiveness of attention. <br><br>  <strong>6. Long-term memory is disabled during sleep</strong> <br><br>  When we sleep, the brain section responsible for transmitting information to long-term memory is disabled.  That is why dreams disappear quickly after we wake up.  For the same reason, our dreams are deprived of the logic of events that is familiar to us, and in most cases it does not seem strange to us until we begin to analyze them in the waking state. <br><br>  <strong>7. Memory has instant playback function.</strong> <br><br>  In the beginning, I mentioned that memory is divided into three types, one of which is sensory memory.  So, sensory memory, using sight and hearing, allows you to scroll through the recently heard sounds or seen images in your head.  This is manifested, for example, when we talk at a party with one person, but at the same time we can remember what the other person was saying at that moment.  If you are asked to repeat what we just said during the performance, you just have to wait a few seconds.  Often, students themselves can reproduce this message in their head and get an answer to their question. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/19917/">https://habr.com/ru/post/19917/</a></p>
