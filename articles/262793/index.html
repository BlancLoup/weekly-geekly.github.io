What and how are developers at risk </h2><br>  I will start the article, no matter how I would like to go straight to the point, from a distance, but not too far.  At the initial stage of development, many developers prefer to work as individuals and receive ‚Äúauthor's remuneration‚Äù for their work, pay 13 percent of the personal income tax in the spring of the year following the reporting year, and feel relatively dry and comfortable.  This approach, however, has its own nuances, risks and pitfalls, but more importantly, its discussion is not the topic of this article. <br><br>  In this material I would like to focus on those who decided to go to the next level in their activities, faced the need to register themselves or their company as a business entity, and successfully completed these actions.  In the overwhelming majority of cases, developers moving from working as an individual to a new stage become individual entrepreneurs or create a limited liability company.  It is quite expected that simultaneously with such registration, developers will have the responsibility and obligations defined by law to the state, including tax compliance.  And here quite predictable difficulties usually begin. <br><br>  There is a very common and in many respects fair opinion that law and law are very confused and in many respects inaccessible to a layman.  Moreover, there are quite a few developers who hold such an opinion, who continue to work as an individual entrepreneur or a limited liability company more ‚Äúon a whim,‚Äù rather than with an understanding of the legal basis of their, essentially, business.  Some of the developers in an attempt to come to some kind of confidence in relations with regulatory bodies from time to time or on a permanent outsource condition attract various consultants or accounting firms to design and conduct their activities - after all, in general, this is quite profitable and convenient.  Nevertheless, the lack of legal literacy among the developers themselves, it seems to me, carries an abundance of various risks, among which I would like to emphasize the following: <br><br><ul><li>  Without possessing at least basic knowledge of the legal basis of their activities, the developers are forced to rely almost entirely on the competence of the lawyers, accountants and tax experts they use to service this activity. </li><li>  The lack of necessary knowledge creates an objective inability to control the quality of legal, accounting and consulting services provided, which exposes the developer to a significant risk of committing various violations in the relevant areas. </li></ul><br>  Among other things, among the negative consequences can be identified the risks of inadvertently committing <b>tax violations</b> , the danger of which is exacerbated due to their accumulated nature.  If for some reason taxes were initially calculated and paid incorrectly, the amount of potential non-payment is constantly increasing, and with it the degree of responsibility (fines, penalties, and so on) grows.  A bad scenario implies the identification of such irregularities during a field tax audit, which can be carried out quite a long time after the developer begins its activity as an individual entrepreneur or a limited liability company, for example, in 5-7 years.  Accordingly, violations accumulated over all these years can ‚Äúsurface‚Äù at the same time and by the amount prove to be significant or very significant, depending on the financial success of the developer during this period of time.  The penalties that follow the inspection may become proportional to the size of the supervisory authority in the event of violations (in this case, the Federal Tax Service). <br><br>  Of course, law and law are indeed very confused, especially considering the quality of legislation, but the situation in which people continue to conduct their activities without at least a basic understanding of these processes cannot but cause alarm.  Developers, in my opinion, people are far from stupid and are more than capable, with their own will and little help from the side, to increase their legal literacy to a level sufficient to begin a meaningful understanding of the laws and codes, which, in fact, basically regulate their activities of the state.  That, in turn, is a significant step towards a stable and secure existence of a business over a long period of time. <br><br>  Unfortunately, it is necessary to recognize that an ordinary developer is practically deprived of sufficiently accessible ways to obtain adequate information about the various legal and tax nuances of his business.  State bodies with which he can interact through written and electronic appeals often do not have the competence to conduct legal expertise and delve into all the subtleties of the questions asked by them regarding the basis of work, for example, with Apple or Google, and therefore rarely give answers to the merits and often limited to quoting relevant legislation and codes.  The lack of competence, by the way, means that these bodies do not have such a function assigned to them by law, that is, formally, in principle, they should not and are not obliged to carry out legal examinations and give official interpretations to business contracts. <br><br>  One of the relatively realistic ways to get an answer from, for example, the tax service, which has at least some practical value, is to send a correctly formulated question, which, again, is most often impossible due to lack of legal literacy, and moreover, in many cases even this cannot resolve the ambiguity of the interpretation of legislation.  If you ask the tax authorities "How to work properly under an agreement with Apple?", In response, in most cases, you can get the already mentioned quoting of legislation and tax code.  Which, again, does not have any particular practical benefit, since without an answer in essence, the developer is again alone with his questions, at the same point in which he was before the referral.  Thus, for the most part, it is only through mutual assistance from the developer community that it is possible to shed light on such a complicated, but extremely important topic such as the ability to read and understand laws, and most importantly, apply them for the purposes of conducting their activities correctly in terms of legislation and paying taxes. <br><br>  For urgent need, I devoted the last week to a thorough study of some parts of the Civil and Tax Codes, as well as reading forums, feature articles and opinions of various legal specialists, in order to create a relatively complete picture of what we, the developers, are doing from the point of view of legislation and tax authority serving as our main supervisory authority and counterpart.  The result was the identification of <b>some tax nuances</b> directly related to developers implementing their applications and games under contracts with Apple and Google, as well as the understanding that the information gathered properly arranged and presented to all interested readers would be the best way to make a modest contribution to the dissemination. It seemed to me very useful knowledge that can be useful to most of us. <br><br>  Before turning to the content of the article, I would like to make a few explanations so that readers can correctly evaluate the following.  Of course, it would be great if this article was prepared and published by a professional lawyer specializing in the field of IT, but so far there is no such person, as far as I know.  Personally, I, unfortunately, do not have the qualifications of a lawyer, accountant, economist or tax service employee, so do not take all the provisions and theses of this article as an indisputable truth in the last resort.  If someone is still interested, then in my professional activity my interests lie in the field of game development and 3D graphics, and besides this I am an individual entrepreneur with an employee who uses a simplified taxation system, therefore my interest in the topic indicated in the title is including a purely practical interest. <br><br>  The article in my vision is more food for thought, a collection of useful information, an incentive to increase legal literacy and an invitation to discuss controversial issues.  If you have additional questions or comments on individual statements, ask them in the comments or dispute my interpretation there.  In the discussion, as you know, truth can be born.  In other words, if this article gives rise to additional discussions, new opinions and comments of experts in the field of law, accounting or taxation, I will only be glad, because a good comment can be essentially more valuable than all the material as a whole (although I tried to This situation did not arise, ho-ho!). <br><br>  The content of the article was decided to present in two stages - by presenting some theoretical background at the first stage and practical analysis at the second.  In the theoretical part, I will share the experience of studying the Civil and Tax Codes, and also pay attention to the basic concepts, knowledge of which is necessary for understanding the legal basis of our activities.  In the practical part, we will look at two tax ‚Äútricks‚Äù arising from those applying the simplified taxation system, and also consistently follow the logic of applying the Tax Code to interpreting our activities from the point of view of legislation in order to substantiate these very tax nuances and get answers to some questions. <br><br>  Stocking tea, cookies, patience and begin. <br><br><h2>  Civil Code, Property Rights and Agency Agreement </h2><br>  So, as already mentioned, the theoretical part will be mainly devoted to the Civil Code and some of its provisions that are directly related to the developers and what they essentially do when they sell their games and applications under contracts with Apple or Google.  To begin with, I consider it necessary to put forward certain theses and substantiate them from the point of view of the Civil Code.  If it would be interesting to someone to get a more complete picture of the following, I recommend that you study Chapter 69 of the Civil Code or even the VII section as a whole, since I will try not to dwell too much on citing the provisions of the code, highlighting only the essential points. <br><br>  Thesis: from the point of view of the Civil Code, applications and games are <b>computer programs for</b> which the developer-creator has <b>exclusive property rights</b> to the <b>result of intellectual activity</b> (such objects are sometimes called intellectual property).  To justify this thesis, we use the corresponding articles of the Civil Code. <br><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Civil Code of the Russian Federation.</b>  <b class="spoiler_title">Property rights to the result of intellectual activity</b> <div class="spoiler_text">  <b>Article 1225. Protected results of intellectual activity and means of individualization</b> <br><br>  1. <b>The results of intellectual activity</b> and equated to them means of individualization of legal entities, goods, works, services and enterprises that are granted legal protection (intellectual property) are: <br><br>  <b>2) programs for electronic computers</b> <br><br>  <b>Article 1226. Intellectual Rights</b> <br><br>  Intellectual rights, which include the <b>exclusive right</b> , which is a <b>property right</b> , and in the cases provided for by this Code, also non-property rights and other rights (right, access right and others). <br><br>  <b>Article 1228. Author of the result of intellectual activity</b> <br><br>  3. The exclusive right to the result of intellectual activity created by creative work, initially arises from its author.  This right may be transferred by the author to another person under the contract, and may also be transferred to other persons on other grounds established by law. <br><br>  <b>Article 1229. Exclusive Right</b> <br><br>  1. A citizen or a legal entity who has the exclusive right to the result of intellectual activity or to the means of individualization (holder of rights) shall have the right to use such result or such means at its discretion in any way not contrary to the law.  The rightholder may dispose of the exclusive right to the result of intellectual activity or to the means of individualization (article 1233), unless otherwise provided by this Code. <br><br>  The right holder may, at its discretion, authorize or prohibit other persons to use the result of intellectual activity or means of individualization.  The absence of a prohibition is not considered consent (permission). <br><br>  The transfer of the exclusive right to the result of intellectual activity can be carried out in two ways - by <b>alienating the exclusive property right</b> ( <i>full and one-time sale of the program or game - the author's comment</i> ), or by granting a contractual <b>right to use the result of intellectual activity (license agreement</b> ). <br><br>  <b>Article 1233. Disposition of exclusive right</b> <br><br>  1. The rightholder may dispose of the exclusive right belonging to him to the result of intellectual activity or to the means of individualization in any way that does not contradict the law and the essence of such exclusive right, including by alienating it under a contract to another person (contract on alienating the exclusive right) or <b>granting the right to another person use of the relevant result of intellectual activity or means of individualization within the limits established by the contract (licensing agreement</b>  <b>op).</b> <br><br>  The conclusion of a license agreement does not entail the transfer of the exclusive right to the licensee. </div></div><br>  By the way, in addition to exclusive property rights, authors also have personal non-property rights, such as, for example, the right of authorship and the right to a name, which you cannot refuse or transfer to someone else in principle - such rights are inalienable and non-transferable. <br><br>  Thus, based on the foregoing, in the sale of applications and games under contracts with Apple or Google in the relevant shopping venues, in fact, <b>non-exclusive rights to the result of intellectual activity are transferred through a licensing agreement</b> between the seller (developer) and the buyer.  In my opinion, knowledge of what, from the point of view of legislation, applications and games are, is simply necessary because the Tax Code uses the terms ‚Äúgoods, services, property rights, intellectual property rights‚Äù.  A developer who, for the second time in his life, has discovered the code, it may be completely incomprehensible whether the programs are goods, or services, or both.  Accordingly, he cannot correctly apply the provisions of the articles of the Tax Code, in which often goods, services and property rights are regulated differently.  Now, knowing that applications and games belong to the object of civil law ‚Äúproperty rights to the results of intellectual activity,‚Äù when reading the laws, it will be possible to clearly understand what is relevant to us and what is not. <br><br>  The articles of the Civil Code cited above mention the <b>license contract</b> several times.  The license agreement as a means of disposing of property rights to the result of intellectual activity is mainly governed by the provisions of Articles 1235-1240 of the Civil Code.  I will quote them under the spoiler, but within the framework of this material they are not strictly required for reading, although I would still recommend to get acquainted with their provisions at your leisure.  Those who have decided not to do this yet can safely move on. <br><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Civil Code of the Russian Federation.</b>  <b class="spoiler_title">License agreement</b> <div class="spoiler_text">  <b>Article 1235. License Agreement</b> <br><br>  1. Under a license agreement, one party - the owner of the exclusive right to the result of intellectual activity or to the means of individualization (licensor) grants or undertakes to give the other party (licensee) the right to use such result or such means within the limits provided by the contract. <br><br>  The licensee may use the result of intellectual activity or means of individualization only within the limits of those rights and in the ways provided for in the license agreement.  The right to use the result of intellectual activity or means of individualization, not expressly stated in the license agreement, shall not be deemed granted to the licensee. <br><br>  2. The license contract shall be concluded in writing, unless otherwise provided for by this Code.  Failure to comply with the written form entails the invalidity of the license agreement. <br><br>  Granting the right to use the result of intellectual activity or means of individualization under a license agreement is subject to state registration in the cases and in the manner provided for in Article 1232 of this Code. <br><br>  3. The license agreement must indicate the territory in which the use of the result of intellectual activity or means of individualization is allowed.  If the territory in which the use of such a result or such an instrument is allowed is not specified in the contract, the licensee shall have the right to use them throughout the entire territory of the Russian Federation. <br><br>  4. The term for which the license contract is concluded cannot exceed the term of the exclusive right to the result of intellectual activity or to the means of individualization. <br><br>  In the case when the term of its validity is not specified in the license agreement, the agreement is considered to be concluded for five years, unless otherwise provided by this Code. <br><br>  In case of termination of the exclusive right the license agreement is terminated. <br><br>  5. Under a license agreement, the licensee undertakes to pay the licensor the remuneration stipulated by the agreement, unless the agreement provides otherwise. <br><br>  If there is no condition on the amount of remuneration in the paid license agreement or the procedure for determining it, the agreement shall be deemed not concluded.  In this case, the rules for determining the price provided for by paragraph 3 of Article 424 of this Code shall not apply. <br>  Payment of remuneration under a license agreement may be provided in the form of fixed one-time or periodic payments, interest deductions from income (revenue) or in another form. <br><br>  5.1.  Granting the right to use the result of intellectual activity or means of individualization in relations between commercial organizations throughout the world and for the entire duration of the exclusive right under the conditions of an exclusive license is not allowed unless otherwise provided by this Code. <br><br>  6. The license agreement must provide for: <br><br>  1) the subject of the contract by indicating the result of intellectual activity or means of individualization, the right to use of which is granted under the contract, indicating, in appropriate cases, the number of the document certifying the exclusive right to such result or to such means (patent, certificate); <br><br>  2) ways to use the result of intellectual activity or means of individualization. <br><br> 7.                       ,   . <br><br> <b> 1236.   </b> <br><br> 1.    : <br><br> 1)                    ( () ); <br><br> 2)                    ( ). <br><br>  1.1.              ,                  ,      . <br><br> 2.      ,    (). <br><br> 3.                  ,   1       . <br><br> <b> 1237.   </b> <br><br> 1.             ,         .    ,           ,        ,         . <br><br> 2.           - ,                  . <br><br> 3.        ,    ,      ,      ,    ,              ,   ,    . <br><br> 4.                                    ,   .              ,          . <br><br> <b> 1238.  </b> <br><br> 1.

The reason for this is that the agency agreement is in its essence a mixed type of contract, providing for the commission of legal actions on behalf of the Principal and at the expense of the Principal (signs of an order agreement) and legal actions on behalf of the Agent and at the expense of the Principal (signs of an agreement ). The classification, as can be seen from the description, depends on whose name the agent acts under the terms of the contract. In addition, under the agency contract, the Agent also performs actual actions - for example, concluding transactions with end customers, delivering applications, hosting and so on, for which the Agent receives a reward and which suggests that there are signs of </font></font><b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">compensated services</font></font></b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> provided by the Agent - Principal.</font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Separately, I would like to emphasize an extremely important circumstance, which is key to understanding the further discussion of the tax consequences of such contracts and characterizing equally the agency contracts, commission contracts and commission contracts - all transactions under these contracts are made </font></font><b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">at the expense of the Principal, the Principal or the Principal</font></font></b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> , respectively.

The answer ‚Äúno‚Äù to such a question will be quite expensive - both in the form of the tax amount assessed according to the results of the audit, and in the form of fines and penalties for late tax payments.Specific amounts of fines and penalties are in the Administrative Code and the Tax Code. In the worst case, if we‚Äôve been working very successfully all these years (every cloud has a silver lining), there can be a question of tax evasion on a large or very large scale, with responsibility up to criminal responsibility.

Apple and Google, as you know, are foreign organizations, and developers contract with their foreign representative offices - iTunes SARL, for example, acting as a party to a contract with Apple, is not a resident of the United States, but of Luxembourg. Therefore, according to the Tax Code, in certain situations their services rendered in Russia may be subject to VAT. Let's try to understand this issue, having examined more closely the relevant provisions of the Tax Code.</font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The first question that will probably arise in connection with the designated topic is that individual entrepreneurs and organizations that apply the simplified taxation system are not VAT payers. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">This is true and not true at the same time. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">For clarification on this subject, we turn to the same Tax Code.</font></font><br><br><div class="spoiler"> <b class="spoiler_title"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Article 346.11. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">General provisions (with USN)</font></font></b> <div class="spoiler_text"> 3.

It should be emphasized once again that what is stated in this article, as I believe at the moment, is equally applicable to contracts with Google, Steam and similar companies operating under similar conditions.</font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">We know that Apple Inc. is a foreign person who is not registered as a taxpayer in the tax authorities of the Russian Federation. Here it is worth making two reservations - firstly, it is more correct to speak about the existence of a contract with the Luxembourg company iTunes SARL, the daughter of Apple, from which we receive money, not Apple, Inc., and secondly - there is still a company in Russia "Apple Rus", which, as far as I know, is engaged only in the sale of Apple technology and, most likely, the relationship to iTunes SARL and Apple, Inc. for tax purposes in the context of the mentioned VAT for the services of its parent company does not matter. I doubt very much that Apple has gone on to pay VAT on Russian developers through Apple Rus, especially in light of the factthat last year the form of the contract was changed so that any possible additional taxes are passed on to the developers.</font></font><br><br>   ,                      .         21  ,           Apple    161 . <br><br><div class="spoiler"> <b class="spoiler_title"> 161.      </b> <div class="spoiler_text"> 1.  <b></b>  (, <b></b> ), <b>      </b> ,  ‚Äî <b> ,          </b> ,     <b>    </b>  (, <b></b> )   . <br><br>            (, )        . <br><br> 2.  ,    1  ,  <b> </b> .   <b>      ,      ,     </b>  (, <b></b> ) <b>    1    </b> . <b>   ,              ,     ,      ,   ,   </b> . <br><br> 5. <b></b>  ,   ,  , <b>       ,          ,                ,           ,         </b> .

I admit, at first I was inclined to believe that VAT would still have to be paid, but now the interpretation of the main and auxiliary services looks very plausible to me and at the moment I think that there is no need to pay VAT on the cost of Apple services.If someone has sensible comments on this subject or - I will be glad to see them in the comments.</font></font><br><br>   ,        ,           ‚Äî   .                 ,         ,          100      .       ‚Äî    ,              . <br><br><h2>  .        </h2><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">At the end of the article I want to talk a bit about Free-To-Play games, free applications, InApp-purchases, advertising display through services like AdMob and other alternative ways of monetization, but without lengthy calculations on the articles of the Tax Code - in the format of reasoning and giving food for thought . In addition, almost all the necessary articles have already been mentioned in the text above, so if you wish, anyone will be able to return to them and try to trace how these purchases and services look like from the NK point of view (a hint is advertising). We will talk about the taxation of these types of income value added tax (VAT), or rather, what opinions on this matter exist at the organizations and the tax service.</font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Those who follow the news may have noticed that in the past year and a half at least twice there were reports that the gaming unit of Mail.Ru Group is suing the Federal Tax Service about returning the previously paid VAT on in-game purchases in the amount of at least 184 million rubles. Mail.Ru Group, obviously, does not apply the simplified taxation system, so we will keep in mind that the matter directly concerns only the general taxation system (DOS). At the same time, the very fact of the interpretation and determination of the essence of InApp purchases by the Tax Service is important, therefore, the mentioned proceedings are relevant and may be relevant for those applying SST.</font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The Mail.Ru case deals mainly with the legality of applying the tax benefit provided for in subparagraph 26 of paragraph 2 of Article 149, which exempts certain operations from VAT. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">This sub-item and the essence of the benefit, expressed in it:</font></font><br><br><div class="spoiler"> <b class="spoiler_title"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Article 149. Non-taxable transactions (exempted from taxation)</font></font></b> <div class="spoiler_text"> 2.    (  )  (  , ,    )    : <br><br> 26)    ,  ,  , <b>    </b> ,  ,   ,   (-),   <b>          </b> ; </div></div><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Mail.Ru Games considered that the additional functionality acquired by users in the form of in-game purchases is an extension of their rights to use the results of intellectual activity, that is, in fact, an extension of the license and ‚Äúgetting access to certain parts of the program code for a fee‚Äù. Therefore, such purchases would not be subject to VAT. However, the Federal Tax Service is of a different opinion: the department considered that this is not a ‚Äúlicense extension‚Äù, but a completely independent additional service, or, to be more precise, ‚Äúapplication management service‚Äù. Since services rendered on the territory of Russia (we recall Article 148 of the Tax Code), with some exceptions, are subject to VAT, the claim for the return of VAT paid was denied in the court of first instance,as well as in the arbitration court at the retrial. If these decisions are not canceled, Mail.Ru Games will probably not only have to leave the VAT already paid on the tax service accounts, but also pay it later on from all in-game purchases made in their games and applications. The bill will go to billions of rubles. I think that the position of the supervisory authority on this issue is expressed very clearly, so draw the appropriate conclusions if this issue affects your activities.therefore, draw appropriate conclusions if this question affects your activities.therefore, draw appropriate conclusions if this question affects your activities.</font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Now what concerns advertising in free applications. The procedure for calculating the tax under the simplified taxation system, apparently, as in the contract with Apple, may depend on what type of contract the agreement with the intermediary who provides us with banners or other materials of advertisers will be assigned to. If such a contract is recognized as an agent, then the tax base for the USN 6% will be the entire amount of the proceeds received by the agent. At the same time, in the comments to this article, we managed to find out that the contract, for example, with AdMob as an option of the Adsense program, </font></font><a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/262793/"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">is not</font></font></a> ,        . ,             . ,               ¬´¬ª  ,       ,     ¬´¬ª  ,      ,   . <br><br>          ,           . , ,      ,        (  )  ,     ,            . ,          ‚Äî   . <br><br><div class="spoiler"> <b class="spoiler_title"> ,    </b> <div class="spoiler_text">                 :         4  1  148 ,        .

However, there are some differences - for example, in Belarus there are no privileges exempting from paying income tax of foreign organizations that do not operate in the territory of the Republic of Belarus through a permanent representative office. And the tax rate, by the way, is as much as 15 percent. To be exempted from this tax, you must provide the tax office with a certificate confirming the foreign location of the organization with which the contract was concluded. Moreover, an agreement on the avoidance of double taxation should be concluded with this country (by the way, there is no such agreement with Luxembourg). At the moment, I sent an appeal to the Ministry of Taxes and Duties to clarify some details and requirements for such a certificate.If there are interested habrovchan from Belarus, I think in two or three weeks it will be possible to issue a new article and consider in it the features of the legislation of the Republic of Belarus in the same context as the material of this article.</font></font><br><br> <i><b> 27  2015 :</b>         ,    ,    ,        .          ,      250     ,          .     <a href="http://www.e-kontur.ru/enquiry/190"> </a>  .,         . <br><br>      ,   1  2013       (  ,    , )           ,      (  ),           .  ,           65   1 ,        66 ,  ¬´¬ª                    .</i> <br><br>  That's all.<font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">I hope that the article was useful to you and you learned a lot of new and interesting.
