  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Pleasant trifles</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  When a 3D printer is in the office and prints something custom every day, then suddenly, but periodically, events happen that are completely incomprehensible to citizens ‚Äúfrom the street,‚Äù for example, selling fruit in the market. <br><br>  So this time, people came with a problem order.  It is the middle of December in the courtyard, there is a lot of work, and the visitors are requested to make some kind of device out of what is (and what is).  Apparently, in a certain laboratory, all the time, with deadlines, it is necessary to complete the test cycle, the budget seems to be from the employees' own funds, the deadlines are yesterday.  We, of course, undertook). <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  The staff of the laboratory dragged the ‚Äúpieces of iron‚Äù into our office, we carried out full-scale measurements, and together made up an evening T.Z. <br><br>  From the waveguide / plug extracted from the special storage (the excellent quality was noted by those present, Soviet times, the silver coating of the channel), the necessary part was cut off, a hole was drilled in the required place, and a landing pad was burned around.  Was cut from a piece of brass flange.  The required length of brass was purchased from a guy named Alex and delivered, on his own, on a day off.  The brass of the flange and the brass of the waveguide differed in composition somewhat, but according to those.  This was not a critical task.  We also solved the problem of installing a flange on a waveguide body, without using a conductor.  Conductor required dimensions, we did not have.  Applied the way curly recess - a similar protrusion.  In general, we solved this non-trivial engineering problem purely on the machine, I remember everyone wanted to sleep all the time, the printers worked 20 hours a day.  Who is in the subject, he will understand.

      It is not even funny, in terms of geometry, our flange is more accurate than the Gostovsky one installed at the other end.  At least, so we were told by technologists, and this seems to be true, given that all of the above operations were carried out on the SLC600G Premium wire electroerosion machine and the HS430L ultra-precision high-speed milling machine.  And, by the way, in the future, we intend to apply the tested method of landing and centering flanges already serially. <br><br>  Further, after soldering, our galvanist very carefully ‚Äúpoured‚Äù silver flange without touching the inside, and here, op-la, the waveguide is ready.  The product is non-standard and single, as almost always with us, however. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/73b/1d3/544/73b1d3544a894e19ae29844d5805be11.jpg"><br><br>  But it was a little small: it was necessary to install the measuring part on the body of the manufactured waveguide, and with ideal geometry and the ability to remove / install this part, as needed. <br><br>  Without saying a word, it was decided to print the fixing centering unit on the printer.  After this decision, everything else was very simple.  Measurement, modeling, printing with 90 percent filling.  The resulting detail looked so primitive that it became clear right away ‚Äî there would be no problem. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/79c/cbc/eaf/79ccbceaf8fd42ff8330c78673d81df3.jpg"><br><br>  So, there really were no problems.  Nuts tightly into the nests printed for them, the measuring part exactly fits into place.  The design turned out to be "self-centering", after tightening the studs-bolts, the product as a whole, in the assembly, turned out to be what was required.  That is, the reader understands: a non-standard product was designed and manufactured, in which components and parts were thought out and made in the first copy.  The key to success was the concept: <br><br>  a) perform metalworking operations only on modern CNC machines <br>  b) the fastener is made of plastic by printing on a 3D printer. <br><br>  It was these points that allowed the project to give reliability and at the same time flexibility in the process, the possibility of maneuver.  The first plastic "stray" was "cramped."  We, of course, did not begin to take a file, just broke it, having conducted full-scale tests for strength. <br><br>  Printed the second copy with refinements on the dimensions.  Everything came just perfect, but why be surprised at the accuracy of printing, measured in dozens, but microns)). <br><br>  Well, I don‚Äôt even want to compare with the option of manufacturing a fastening centering unit made of aluminum or steel. <br><br>  I call the client, saying that the product is ready, but it is necessary to paint, let it come tomorrow morning.  No, it is not necessary to paint anything, but, he answers, can I take it today?  Yes, no problem, waiting.  The product was assembled to the customer on the 25th, at 22 pm. <br><br>  I want to say that it was in this simple case that the qualitative shift in engineering thinking was very clearly manifested.  Modern machines and robots make it possible, with amazing simplicity, to implement the most seemingly most complex technical solutions. <br><br>  You just need to know their capabilities, at least separately.  And if you represent the capabilities of robots and programmable machines in the aggregate, you will see truly incredible horizons. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/373047/">https://habr.com/ru/post/373047/</a></p>
