      Our tracker for many years worked with copyright holders, in connection with which many of their representatives were registered on the site.  They were free to close all distributions for which they had their ‚Äúcopyright‚Äù right.  In this regard, many releases on individual platforms were either banned or not recommended for distribution. <br><br>  But today has put an end to these agreements, because  users from the Russian Federation have blocked access to our tracker.  Consequently, the right holders did not want to continue cooperation, which allows us to no longer adhere to it. <br><br>  Therefore, there is no need to worry about their releases, which can be closed by software.  Feel free to share! " </blockquote><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Oleg Yashin (Russian Shield Association) <a href="https://roem.ru/25-01-2016/217390/rutracker-gov/">confirmed the</a> information. <br><br><blockquote>  ‚ÄúAt the moment, it has been officially announced (and I confirm this) that all CHA accounts without exceptions have been transferred to regular user status [rights holders worked under CHA accounts - they could delete violating distribution rights]. <br><br>  Deletion in the usual way through the abuse department while on ‚Äúprevention‚Äù. <br><br>  In the course of the week, the future tracker policy regarding the copyright holders will be clear. ‚Äù </blockquote><br>  The RuTracker Administration warned about such consequences of the eternal blockade in November last year, after one of the decisions of the Moscow City Court.  Then they gave <a href="http://rublacklist.net/13442/">an interview to</a> Roskomsvoboda. <br><br><blockquote>  <b>RKS</b> : We think everyone would be interested to know whether you will divide the rights of those account holders who currently have the right to block distributions themselves?  And what happens to those distributions that were previously blocked by them? <br><br>  <b>Rutreker</b> : We are currently working on this issue, we have not yet made a final decision, it is clear that much will be revised.  We'll also see at that time how these right holders will react (if they react) to the situation with the decision of the Moscow City Court.  We were open to the search for a compromise, but now we felt unreasonable persecution of legal forms (broad in interpretation) in relation to us and to the millions of users of our portal.  Let's just say: definitely a number of individuals, representatives of various offices or rightholders will not be able to cut the distribution with us soon, we will deprive them of this opportunity, as a symmetrical answer.  Regarding the restoration of previously closed hands, we have not yet made a final decision, but everything goes to the fact that we are ready to do this in the case of our blocking. </blockquote><br>  January 25, 2016 the site RuTracker is <a href="http://reestr.rublacklist.net/rec/62664/">entered in the register of</a> prohibited information, and Russian providers received an order to block access to it forever. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/8bb/26f/7de/8bb26f7de11e404ebf1098ebd49aa911.png"></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/355936/">https://habr.com/ru/post/355936/</a></p>
