For the past 6 months, we have been preparing for release our iOS <i>App in the Air app</i> for those who fly frequently.  And here we are at the finish line.  In the course of the work, the name was changed, the screens were redrawn several times, the code was copied almost from scratch, but we really like the results. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/7c6/956/b86/7c6956b86057e9bce4cb0200198f5a0d.png" alt="image"></div><br><br>  Well, since we have nothing to advertise yet - we have not yet graduated - we would like to share with you a few insights that have arisen during the development process.  These are the thoughts that we would have dreamed of telling ourselves six months ago.

    <a name="habracut"></a><br>  <b>Design does not need to outsource.</b>  Initially, we gave the design to outsource a very reputable person.  The result of his work was at a very high level, but it was no longer our application.  Plus, a person at an outsourcing is still seeking to complete the project on time, and in a startup startup with constantly changing requirements it is difficult to work in this format.  You can't always tell him - ‚ÄúI showed five people, they did not understand these buttons, redraw them.‚Äù  As a result, we found another person who became part of the team and did not just ‚Äúdo everything right,‚Äù but also brought something of his own. <br><br>  <b>We test design on fingers.</b>  First, we tested from a monitor screen or from a projector.  In fact, also a good way, gives a lot of interesting thoughts.  But it is even better to simply give the person a phone with a picture and look after his fingers.  Often people clicked on some elements, but they did not say it out loud.  Only by watching the movement of users' fingers could one understand which elements attract attention, and which elements are strongly ‚Äúhidden‚Äù. <br><br>  <b>Remember who you are making the application for.</b>  Despite the fact that we are in Moscow, we are developing a product for the American market.  And sometimes we forgot to restructure our thinking in the American way.  For example, at first we offered Aeroflot flight as a test flight or took the weather in Celsius.  Always keep in mind your end users, the features of their perception and language.  Hire a netiva corrector and provide him with all the texts of the application - do not rely only on translators (who see dynamic texts as excerpts) and your knowledge of the language. <br><br>  <b>Test as often as possible and faster - <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuous_integration">Continuous integration</a> will help you.</b>  All screens cannot be tested on users at the design stage - it‚Äôs not enough to look at beautiful pictures, you also have to watch the transition dynamics.  At the same time, it usually takes several days from the implemented functionality to its testing on the first users - it is necessary to collect for internal purposes, check, collect for external beta testers, send to testflight and send them a reminder about the check.  To reduce this lag and automate the monotonous assembly work, we deployed our CI server - a small mac mini in the office, which automatically collects each new commit and sends it for testing.  Now feedback on new features comes to us already within a few hours, and not days, as before. <br><br>  Right now, we are preparing an application for launch on the American market, and we will be happy to talk about our findings at this stage a bit later - of course, if habrayusers are interested in this. <br><br>  Well, now we would like to use a little of you as a professional community.  We have exhausted stocks of friends with iPhones who could give us their opinion about the application, and are eager for new blood :) Therefore, we will be happy if you help us in beta testing and tell us about your impressions.  Promo codes and buns are provided to our beta testers.  Interesting?  Register <a href="http://bit.ly/wh5yoi">on the beta distribution website</a> or leave your email on our <a href="http://appintheair.mobi/">appintheair.mobi</a> website and we will contact you.  We conduct beta testing in blocks - and the first 10 who want to receive their copy of the application today. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/140442/">https://habr.com/ru/post/140442/</a></p>
