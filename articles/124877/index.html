  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Startup or proven business - the choice is yours</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Startups are now a very fashionable topic that everyone knows about.  Everyone wants to create a startup to become rich and famous like <s>Pavel Durov</s> Mark Zuckerberg.  And some even succeed in this, and then success stories appear on the Internet, as someone created another start-up for little money and his company has already passed over a thousand employees and has become successful and he is famous.  Especially startups are on the IT field, so I decided to write on this resource, maybe someone will think about it. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h4>  Prehistory </h4><br>  Recently I was approached by a friend who worked as a system administrator for a while, then he reached the head of the department and now earns good money from his main job, but decided to go into ‚Äúfree swimming‚Äù. <br><br>  His question was: <br>  - Iskander, I have a million rubles, I want to create a startup - a game for social services.  networks.  Tell me how it is better to distribute this money, how much programmers to take with what salaries, where else it will be necessary to spend money, etc.  In short, help create a business plan. <br><br>  He heard somewhere that the games are now a promising thing, the authors of some games really earn a lot (happy farm, for example), and decided to also make money on this field.  But I urged him to think healthily - yes, the authors of some startups really earn good money.  But how many startups that have not earned anything?  A million rubles is a fairly large amount of money, and she does not really want to risk it.  A startup is always a risk.  Think whether it is worth it?

    <h4>  Story </h4><br>  Of course, I helped him - guided by the approximate terms of development, the salaries of programmers in our region and everything else. <br><br>  But then I offered him an alternative option - if you have money, why risk it once more?  Why not start up franchise work instead of startups? <br><br>  For those who do not know, I will explain - franchising is a form of commercial cooperation when a franchisor company transfers franchisee rights to sell their goods and services.  Often, the franchisee also receives the rights to use the trademark, corporate identity, all the know-how, as well as support and advice from the management company. <br><br>  In my opinion, a franchise does not have all the flaws that a start-up business has: <br>  - when opening a franchise business, the risks are much less - the franchisor company is also interested in developing its network and will not work with obviously unpromising partners <br>  - no need to step on a rake, which has long been passed - the management company will prompt and help with all questions that have arisen, and in a startup you can only rely on yourself. <br><br>  At the same time you get almost "your" business, i.e.  the main goal, for the sake of which they usually go to start-ups in the field of IT, is fulfilled: ‚Äúto stop working for an uncle‚Äù. <br><br>  Yes, the franchise has an obvious drawback - certain funds are required for the opening, whereas a ‚Äústart-up‚Äù can be done in your garage or in a university dormitory.  But let's face it - how many such successful startups in Russia have you seen? <br><br><h4>  The financial side of the issue </h4><br>  My friend told me - ‚Äúfranchise is expensive.‚Äù  It seems to be a common misconception.  In fact, this is far from the case: you can start your business for the minimum amount of money, the cost of launching some types of stores - the so-called island structures in supermarkets - is only about 200-300 thousand rubles. <br><br>  The choice of franchises that can be opened for a million rubles is already huge - in Russia it is about 150 time-tested offers.  Moreover, this list includes a variety of companies for every taste: from ordinary clothing stores or accessories to fast tanning studios, or music schools, laundries, or even the production of rubber coatings for stadiums.  Or, for example, Smeshariki - I think almost everyone knows this brand.  They also have a rather interesting franchise program, and their investments are also small - about 200-500 thousand rubles, as I recall. <br><br>  Yes, this is not an "interesting" startup - the game is in contact.  But this is a time-tested business, on which you can earn good money, and only then invest it in start-ups, or anywhere else, according to your desire. <br><br><h4>  findings </h4><br>  - A startup is good when there is money that is not a pity to lose and you can invest it in a startup. <br>  - if you have money to lose, but you want your business - nafig startups, open a franchise store / restaurant / laundry / personnel agency / music school / medical laboratory, etc. <br>  - when there is already a profitable business - profit can be invested in a ‚Äústartup‚Äù, if you really want to <br><br>  The article turned out a bit crumpled, but it seemed that the main idea was able to be conveyed. <br><br>  So that they do not tell me that this advertising post I intentionally didn‚Äôt insert a single link into it, but in principle everything connected with franchising is quite easy to google, including franchise directories.  I can give links to some interesting offers in a personal order. <br><br>  I have been working for two years in a company that deals with consulting in the field of franchising + our company has one of its own franchises, so I can probably answer your questions related to franchising. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/124877/">https://habr.com/ru/post/124877/</a></p>
