It would seem that something new can be invented in the tablet form factor?  All diagonals are studied, it remains only to vary the "extra-dimensional" characteristics.  But no, in 2012, Apple showed the iPad mini with a 7.9-inch diagonal.  And, after a while, the model pushed brands from the Android camp to the development of an ‚Äúunexpectedly‚Äù eight-inch niche. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/65e/a44/e4a/65ea44e4a98025edde2b9a07409a2cfa.jpg"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Frankly, I was very skeptical of mini-like tablets.  Previously, I had several seven-inch tablets, which left nothing behind but a sense of uncertainty.  Now I‚Äôve got an eight-inch iconBIT NETTAB SKAT RX, which radically changed my mind about small tablets. <br><br>  For me, the model has become in some sense "inconvenient", since it is highly probable that it brought the trouble of selling the current 10-inch home tablet.  And, accordingly, buying a new one.  Because, as it seems to me, the quality ratio of iconBIT NETTAB SKAT RX and its price tag of about 7,000 rubles does not cause any thoughts about the justification of the purchase.  Why?  About this and, as they say, not only - further. <br><br><h4>  Packing and packaging </h4><br>  This is not the first tablet brand that came to me lately.  And again at iconBIT right on the box are colored pencils, thereby ‚Äúunobtrusively‚Äù draws attention to the advantages of the display.  And it is not at all groundless.  As expected, on the front side we get acquainted with the features of the model, and from the end we ‚Äúrun over‚Äù according to the characteristics.  Among which immediately draws attention to the processor frequency - 1.8 GHz, and even the Cortex A9. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/ed1/b59/8ad/ed1b598ad376b55c3813f55753f4cf6d.jpg"><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/275/ca4/527/275ca45270b45b7ddadac9d327b13358.jpg"><br>  The box contains brief instructions, a USB OTG cable, a microUSB wire and, which is extremely rare in tablets, headphones.  Charging unit attached.  By the way, the model does not know how to charge through the microUSB port. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/8b2/636/7f6/8b26367f6fbba877223c8dd389303ef5.jpg">

    <h4>  Design and controls </h4><br>  As a rule, the "main" opinion about the device is formed without its inclusion - purely by external perception.  SKAT RX does not apply to such cases, the device more interested me just after the "activation".  Be that as it may, the form factor of a 7.85-inch tablet in the hands seems almost perfect in the balance between home and "street" device.  At the same time, the tablet is quite comfortable to hold with one hand, which is not possible with the 9.7 and 10.1-inch tablets.  NETTAB weighs 335 grams, it is not the smallest indicator, but you can‚Äôt call it subjectively heavy.  Undoubtedly, there would be a cover of plastic (and not metal), the tablet would be lighter than 50 grams. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/609/195/1de/6091951de5903339297c8f6a59a1240d.jpg"><br>  In terms of length, width and thickness, the model is almost the same as the iPad mini - 202 x 136 x 8.6 mm.  The device is thin, the visual thickness is further reduced by the ‚Äúfalling‚Äù edges of the cover. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/e57/f9e/533/e57f9e53365b8d631770380717cf77a2.jpg"><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/489/097/885/489097885a94cb2a27e894483485ac25.jpg"><br>  The assembly turned out to be a solid "five".  Previously, my experience with ‚Äúmetal‚Äù tablets was accompanied by a significant crackle of cases.  Here you can see that the details fit tightly.  The material of the back side and the ends is metal in silver color.  The surface is non-marking, but tactile - strongly for an amateur. <br><br>  A few words about color - the tablet comes in white and black versions of the case.  I will not judge which one looks more attractive, since I only had a white tablet.  And, as practice shows, the glamor of the device in a particular color can vary greatly in the picture and live. <br><br>  Let's go to the button - connectors - elements on the body.  From the front there are no buttons, Android 4.1 makes itself felt.  The camera is located exactly on top of the center, and right below it ... To be honest, I did not immediately realize that it was a light sensor. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/da3/6b3/d7c/da36b3d7c774f4aad567d6f5ab99e059.jpg"><br>  Directly above the camera is the end, on which are all without exception buttons and connectors.  An interesting and, I think, convenient option.  We observe a slot for a memory card, a 3.5 mm audio output, a charging connector, a microHDMI, microUSB, a volume rocker and a power button.  In the last two cases, the key assignment is engraved on them.  When holding the tablet in portrait orientation, the index finger of the right hand easily embraces both keys, and in landscape orientation, the elements are exactly under the thumb. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/89d/fcd/ea0/89dfcdea03b9237d2394321526f8707c.jpg"><br>  The speakers (or speaker) are mounted on the end under the screen and protected by a neat grille.  No matter how I held the tablet, the sound did not overlap my palm.  The volume itself is average, and this is understandable - in a thin case, especially with a speaker, you do not clear up. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/73c/281/d73/73c281d7361c9bc30d5397ef37cfe827.jpg"><br>  You don‚Äôt talk much about the back side - the camera, the model and serial number, and only that. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/7f3/165/e5e/7f3165e5e91eefa3085efa12d84c76b1.jpg"><br><h4>  Camera </h4><br>  Let's be frank, this is the most passable section in the tablet review.  From the rear - the usual 2 megapixels, from the front - minimal 0.3 megapixels.  We make ‚Äúsimple‚Äù everyday shots with the rear camera, and with the help of the frontal ‚Äúpeephole‚Äù we participate in video chats.  With these tasks, the cameras are coping, and more is not required. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/c54/9ef/a71/c549efa718feadaae1fbc9e5d7897bcd.jpg"><br><h4>  Screen </h4><br>  One of the strongest places of the tablet.  IPS matrix, resolution 1024 x 768 pixels - these parameters are predictable.  But it was after working with this tablet for the first time I wanted to brow-brow compare the ‚Äúthird-party‚Äù model with my home 10-inch comrade.  The color rendition and other parameters of the picture are at an excellent level - without reservation.  As far as I know, the iPad mini matrix is ‚Äã‚Äãno longer Apple exclusive.  I don‚Äôt know if iconBIT was able to get the same display, but a decent image quality is a fact. <br>  On the top - iconBIT NETTAB SKAT RX, on the bottom - my 10-inch tablet with IPS-matrix. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/543/63e/1db/54363e1dba0b426634925727ae534bef.jpg"><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/0c3/574/4f0/0c35744f0da387605d1f67f6e7034b3b.jpg"><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/ccc/94a/c02/ccc94ac0219710abeb29a67909b2aad5.jpg"><br><br>  Speaking of the IPS-matrix, it is customary to imply wide viewing angles.  But in most cases, when I sit down in the kitchen to eat and put the test tablet on the table, the large deflection angle leads to some kind of barely noticeable, but annoying ‚Äúveil‚Äù.  In the case of SKAT RX, the image only slightly darkens, but I did not have to put the tablet against the wall. <br><br>  The surface of the screen is glass.  Sensitivity does not cause complaints, the display regularly responded to pressing. <br><br>  The screen fades in the sun, even at maximum brightness.  Of course, some kind of readability is preserved, but it is far from what is desired.  Lack of?  I think no.  I can not remember the tablet, which would maintain excellent "visibility" of the display in clear weather.  With ‚Äúnormal‚Äù lighting, I did not set more than 30% of the maximum brightness.  I am particularly impressed with the fact that, unlike some IPS-displays, setting 100% here does not lead to a frank overexposure of the image. <br><br><h4>  Performance </h4><br>  It is embarrassing for me to write this, since "nothing foreshadowed trouble."  But iconBIT SKAT RX is almost the only tablet for a very, very long time, which has worked out the stability and performance of Android as ‚Äúexcellent‚Äù.  I do not know what the role of ‚Äúhardware‚Äù or optimization is in this, but the brakes and lags bypassed the model with a little more than completely.  Responsiveness of the system interface, switching between tasks, surfing the web with watching videos on websites and so on - my respect.  And the point because of which, with high probability, this device claims to replace my current tablet. <br><br>  From impressions to numbers.  The processor is a 4-core Rockchip RK3188 (ARM Cortex-A9) with a frequency of 1.8 GHz, the graphics chip is a Mali-400 MP in 4-core design.  Completes the picture of 1 GB of RAM.  I note that Quadrant and Antutu questioned some of the characteristics of the tablet, indicating the frequency of 1.6 GHz and ARMv7.  If the tablet worked with flaws, I would undoubtedly find fault in this place, but due to the lack of reasons for complaints I won‚Äôt ask. <br><br>  Antutu doesn‚Äôt like to be nice, not comparing the devices of the past seasons.  16 846 points - again a decent achievement.  Separately, I provide a detailed comparison of Google Nexus 7, which turned out to be not at all a favorite in the synthetic test. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/cdf/56c/52f/cdf56c52f18046d2589eb9d9ddf88154.png"><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/564/6b1/207/5646b1207ad0dac237dad55c9ccf409b.png"><br>  In the merciless Vellamo, the tablet also failed, earning 1,631 points in HTML5 and 541 points in the Metal section. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/25c/e04/9d5/25ce049d53e7ff8f21617fe4f478d264.png"><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/40d/177/3c6/40d1773c6d5cc34d53b2e86475aabbc6.png"><br><h4>  Games </h4><br>  Perhaps I will start with the opening scene FRONTLINE COMMANDO: NORMANDY.  The landing of the Normandy shader water took place without incident, which is far from everyone. <br>  In Real Racing 3, I still expected a little more.  The gameplay was smooth (or, more correctly, stable), but the FPS clearly did not go beyond 25-30 units.  But in Dead Trigger, the game showed the speed that the title likes to demonstrate only on the top configuration.  Naturally, the graphics settings were set to maximum.  Finally, Eternity Warriors 2 and SG: Dead Zone were tested, everything is fine. <br>  Actually, what I liked most about games.  There are a lot of tablets with excellent characteristics.  And the games on them are "played" quite for themselves.  But here we shot an exploding barrel or some other ‚Äúresource-intensive‚Äù moment is coming with the advent of new objects.  And the delay is triggered, microlag.  The tablet freezes the picture for a split second.  Even if it occurs infrequently, but the eye "catches" and annoys.  In iconBIT NETTAB SKAT RX there were no such microlags. <br><br><h4>  Video </h4><br>  According to the tradition, I somehow got tired of throwing a random selection of clips / films into the tablet‚Äôs memory, and making my own mega-collection with my own test was not a qualification.  Therefore, I honestly borrowed the ‚ÄúMethod of testing video playback and display devices.  Version 1 "at IXBT, the benefit of the site freely provides your video for download.  Results: <br><ul><li>  watch-1920x1080-60p.mp4 - excellent </li><li>  watch-1920x1080-50p.mp4 - excellent </li><li>  watch-1920x1080-30p.mp4 - excellent </li><li>  watch-1920x1080-25p.mp4 - excellent </li><li>  watch-1920x1080-24p.mp4 - cannot be played </li><li>  watch-1280x720-60p.mp4 - not playing </li><li>  watch-1280x720-50p.mp4 - not playable </li><li>  watch-1280x720-30p.mp4 - excellent </li><li>  watch-1280x720-25p.mp4 - excellent </li><li>  watch-1280x720-24p.mp4 - excellent </li></ul><br><br>  The built-in player immediately in the preview window told which clips it refuses to play.  The installed RockPlayer had no effect on the situation.  On the other hand, if the tablet lost the video, it was only excellent. <br><br><h4>  System </h4><br>  The tablet turns on quickly, after 22-23 seconds it is completely ready for work.  Android 4.1 installed.  Yes, who knows - whether there will be an upgrade to Android 4.2 or even more other older versions.  But given the stability and speed of the tablet, I would have thought about this last. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/ad8/842/0eb/ad88420eb5b1c18f07da0e71186c9bcd.png"><br>  To tell about the system is actually nothing.  Seriously.  19 shortcuts, just a couple of add-ons (video player, file manager, ApkInstaller) - even one list screen was not enough.  But of the total 16 GB, we have a total of 14.346 GB available (696 MB of internal memory and 11.65 GB of NAND). <br><br><h4>  Battery </h4><br>  4,000 mAh of built-in battery - a moderate figure, close to the above value is observed in 7-inch rather than 10-inch tablets.  Playing video iconBIT NETTAB pleased me for 4 hours and 10 minutes at 80% of the sound volume and 50% of the screen brightness.  We used ‚Äútypical‚Äù DVDrip with a capacity of 1.36 GB. <br><br><h4>  Conclusion </h4><br>  My overall conclusion on the tablet has already been mentioned on the review, but I will say it again for those reading "diagonally" - either specifically iconBIT NETTAB SKAT RX, or a similar model is the primary bidders for my purchase in the near future.  Although, frankly, my wife does not want to part with our home 10-inch tablet.  But also with the expenditure of 7,000 rubles does not particularly argue for the amount is moderate - this is speaking of the iconBIT price tag as such. <br><br>  As far as I see on Yandex.Market, there are quite a few models of the similar diagonal - 17 pieces, including 6 iPad mini versions priced from 11,150 rubles.  For other models, the price tag is in the range of 7-8 thousand rubles, that is, financial inquiries iconBIT NETTAB SKAT RX is quite competitive. <br><ul><li>  Cons ... I guess I would like to see a slightly larger stock of battery life.  And the metal cover is not at all obligatory, its replacement with plastic would give a tangible weight relief. </li><li>  Pros - a good (I say without irony) screen, good build and excellent (this is generally from a series of fiction) speed and stability of Android. </li></ul><br><br>  PS Plenochki removed immediately after the review. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/188752/">https://habr.com/ru/post/188752/</a></p>
