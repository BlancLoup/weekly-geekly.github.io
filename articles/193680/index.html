  <section class="page js-page"><h1>8 reasons why users refuse to register</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Registering on the site is a big responsibility for most people.  Users who register on your site give their personal information, trusting it to your resource.  Most of today's users are more concerned about who they pass on their personal information.  The virtual world is teeming with hackers and spammers, but who can blame them?  If you have not seen many registration forms, then your form is an obstacle for the user.  Below are 8 main reasons why users do not fill out the registration form. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a><h4>  1. Fear of getting spam </h4><br>  Most users fear that if they fill out the registration form, they will be attacked by spammers.  The main problem with registration forms is that they request an e-mail from a user.  If you ask the user for an e-mail, then tell him, by signing the input field, what you will use it for. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/09f/cee/2a4/09fcee2a4dbfb3d80e5cf81a00dd8a57.png" alt="image">

        </script>
      <br>
    <h4>  2. The fear that logging in via Facebook or Twitter accounts may result in a spam attack from friends or subscribers </h4><br>  Users do not like to receive spam and do not want their friends or subscribers to receive spam.  Signing in with your Facebook or Twitter account can be used for unsolicited spamming.  If you offer the user authorization using Facebook or Twitter - warn that the accounts will not be used for spamming and account data will not be changed. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/5b6/3fe/96c/5b63fe96c363c86843ac431386903db2.png" alt="image"><br><br><h4>  3. Inability to delete an account </h4><br>  Sometimes users are registered and ultimately no longer want to use the site.  Always give users the ability to delete their account!  By giving users the opportunity to delete their account, you will create a comfortable environment for users who do not want to leave traces of their activity on the network.  Let users know about the possibility of deleting their account at the time of registration, and they will never be concerned that their personal information may remain permanently on your site. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/acd/4ff/834/acd4ff834b3b01edb724189b52e3bf3a.png" alt="image"><br><br><h4>  4. Suspicion of unsafe storage and processing of personal data </h4><br>  If users trust you with strictly confidential information, such as a credit card number or home address, they probably want to know that you will store and process their information safely.  This includes the issues of encrypting user data on your server so that the data remains safe in case of a hacking of your site.  Let users know that their personal information is securely stored on your server in an encrypted form. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/e71/d78/52e/e71d7852e8f61069fe4a78a376d3c924.png" alt="image"><br><br><h4>  5. Too much information required to complete, compared to what the site can provide. </h4><br>  If your registration form is too large and takes a lot of time to fill out, users will compare the effort required to complete the registration form and the importance of the information that your resource can provide them.  If the usefulness of the site for a particular user is too low, then he will miss your registration form.  However, if the information on the site is too valuable for the user, then he will make all the necessary efforts to get what he wants.  The main rule is to request the minimum necessary information so as not to suppress users.  After all, you can always get more information from users after registration. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/045/e5e/9c1/045e5e9c12d034d0fab157b2fe76c92e.png" alt="image"><br><br><h4>  6. Request unnecessary information, according to the user. </h4><br>  All data required from the user during registration must be relevant to the site.  If the user feels that you are asking him something unimportant, he will certainly give you false information, or forget about filling out the form at all.  If you need to learn from the user information, the need for which he may call into question, explain why you need this information. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/ee3/867/0c5/ee38670c594c21cfd3d49fe1c9dddb02.png" alt="image"><br><br><h4>  7. Request a credit card for free use </h4><br>  A free period usually offers that users can try the site to decide on paid use.  Asking users about their credit card for the trial period, you ask users to put at risk strictly confidential information before they, in general, decide whether to use the resource or not.  Even if you are not going to withdraw money during the trial period, most users will still not feel comfortable giving you their credit card details to try.  Give users their free period first without filling in the credit card details.  After the trial period expires, just remind the user that if he wants to continue using the service, he needs to pay. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/d85/60c/fec/d8560cfec19851889deee73c8d7cbfe6.png" alt="image"><br><br><h4>  8. Your service is not clear or unattractive. </h4><br>  When users visit your home page, they are required to understand the idea and suggestion of your site.  If users do not understand, then your service needs to be improved.  Users will not register on the site if your site is incomprehensible and unattractive.  Appeal to users should be clearly formulated and display what your site offers, as well as the benefits that users will receive from using the service. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/530/eca/b0b/530ecab0b20a0679a76adfb21e25a4b1.png" alt="image"><br><br><h4>  It's all about the comfort and trust of users. </h4><br>  To enable the user to fill in the registration form is what causes trust and a feeling of comfort.  Get your users by trusting the precautionary measures of their information, as well as transparency regarding the necessary data.  Create a comfortable environment, allowing users to change their information, and during registration ask only what you really need.  If you are able to follow all the above tips, then users will no longer have reasons to not register. <br><br>  PS <a href="http://uxmovement.com/forms/8-reasons-users-arent-filling-out-your-sign-up-form/">Original article</a> from the list of the best for 2012. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/193680/">https://habr.com/ru/post/193680/</a></p>
