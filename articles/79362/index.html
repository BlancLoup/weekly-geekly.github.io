Nokia 6700 Classic is a phone, the main ridge of which is the look.  That is why of the 3 options for the design of the case (black, silver, chrome) you should choose chrome.  Chrome 6700 looks not just catchy.  Any ray of light in the room is instantly reflected from the surface of the phone and scatters with solar hares.  Now, after all the praises of praise, you can stop on a fly in the ointment.  The 6700 is definitely a good phone, but far from perfect.  Even for his seemingly impeccable beauty will have to pay.  The most serious drawbacks of the device lie precisely in appearance.  However, first things first. <br><br><img src="http://www.webfort.ru/raznoe/6700/2.jpg" alt="image"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  The phone is compact enough, but weighty (113 grams).  Subjective sensations in the hand - a pleasant weight.  You see the metal in the case and expect that the phone will not be easy.  That is how it turns out.  The metal in the body is quite thick and strong.  This is clearly seen in the battery cover.  This is not a thin aluminum cap Nokia E52, the metal is completely different.  The phone is very well assembled.  There are simply no gaps, creaks, or gaps.  If you find fault very much, you can see a light slit to the left of the function key block, as well as an imperfect fixing of the plastic insert covering the camera.  But this may be specific to the specimen that fell into my hands.  Now about the shortcomings.  Marco case is monstrous.  As soon as the phone falls into the hands, it instantly slaps.  Even if you wash your hands with soap and water, the phone will immediately become covered with prints.  From a distance, the body slapping does not strike the eye, but in the vicinity of the noble brilliance of chromium, it was already gone.  You can polish the phone to a mirror shine, but then in order to save it, you have to use the phone in gloves.  And the whole surface of the phone is being stained - both the chrome-plated panels, the blocks of digital and function keys, and the screen.  The black and silver versions of such problems, naturally, do not exist, but they also look much simpler than chrome, there is no highlight in them. <br>  There are no complaints about the functional and alphanumeric keys for their main functions.  All keys are well spaced, have a pleasant white backlight, sufficient to work in the dark, the designations on the keys are clearly visible, pressing a nice, the buttons are well fixed.  There are several specific properties about the alphanumeric buttons.  If you are a man and do not shave every day, then you will have problems from contact of this part of the phone with bristles.  The keys just chew hairs when the phone moves up the cheek (when moving in the opposite direction there is no such problem).  One awkward movement when talking - unpleasant feelings are guaranteed.  The exit here is quite simple - do not lean the phone on the cheek. <br><br>  Another disadvantage of the phone is due to the thinness of its body.  I can‚Äôt say that I have huge hands, but there‚Äôs almost nothing to hold the phone at my ear.  Rounded narrow slippery side faces just do not allow to clearly fix the phone in the hand at the ear.  You need to either press the phone with your palm to your ear, or clasp the bottom of the phone with your fingers.  After 6700, I revised my attitude to the hefty thickness of my regular Nokia 5800. But a thin phone is much more convenient to carry in a pocket of jeans.  There it is almost not felt. <br>  Returning to the buttons, you need to stay at one more drawback - uncomfortable end buttons.  There are only 3 of them - ‚Äú+‚Äù, ‚Äú-‚Äù and the camera button.  They are all too thin and too hard.  I especially did not like the camera button.  Firstly, it has a protective stop, which protects it from accidental clicks, but in reality it constantly gets under the finger instead of the button itself.  The button itself is a two-position - focus and snapshot.  Top pressing is done gently, but to take a picture, the button will have to be pressed down with full force.  This is what this results in in practice: you press the focus, and then with a strong push on the ‚Äútrigger‚Äù the phone just twitches, the picture is blurred.  In addition, it is almost impossible to remove something with one hand.

      So that you are not afraid, this is where all the basic troubles end.  Begin Amenities ÔÅä <br>  Although not very large (2.2 inches diagonally), but an excellent AMOLED display is installed in the phone.  The colors are juicy.  Beautiful pictures on the screen look just great!  The only complaint I had about white color, which seemed to me not white enough.  The screen fades in the sun, but everything can be disassembled without problems.  Contrary to popular belief, the dust on the protective transparent plastic covering the top of the screen, I did not clog for a couple of weeks of use, although my phone was not used in ideal conditions. <br>  We also look under the battery cover.  Unfortunately, the slot for a micro SD memory card (the standard and most common type of memory) is located here, and in order to remove the card, you will have to remove the cover.  This procedure, by the way, is also not without difficulties.  The shiny metal lid is devoid of any projections, so pressing and pulling has a smooth polished surface.  If the hands are slightly oily or wet, the lid tight in its place will not surrender.  Included with the phone is a card with a capacity of 1 GB.  Under the battery cover, the battery itself with a capacity of 960 milliamperes still lurked.  This is the average value of the battery capacity, and it shows a fairly average performance.  At best, the device will hardly last more than 2-2.5 days with minimal use.  And this is considering the economical type of screen, quickly fading backlight, not a record set of functions and interfaces. <br><br><img src="http://www.webfort.ru/raznoe/6700/1.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  And here we finally got to the inside of the phone.  It is trivial, we have the most common device with the Series 40 interface. What did not I like after using my beloved 5800?  I did not like the fact that the phone does not read the names of the callers from the phone book with a voice synthesizer.  I also didn‚Äôt like the fact that the phone was quite flexible in configuration, but 1 alarm clock, but most of all I didn‚Äôt like that the phone can neither create nor read long notes, files, texts.  To enter any large text information into the apparatus is simply impossible.  Maybe this can be done with the help of some kind of perversions, like creating web pages and opening them through a browser.  But then they are perversions that not everyone wants to pervert.  And I did not like the fact that in order to unlock the keyboard, you need to press the central button of the joystick and "*", that is, to make sickly somersaults with your finger. <br>  What I liked.  I liked the ‚ÄúActive‚Äù menu, where you can add all the necessary useful functions.  With such a menu, yes, plus with the joystick keys assigned and soft keys, there is no general menu at all!  It is not clear why ‚Äúshare on Ovi‚Äù cannot be removed from the ‚Äúasset‚Äù menu.  I also liked the fact that when writing a new text message, the addressee does not have to be pulled from the phone book, but you can get the last recipients from a short list, or from a list of favorite recipients, or from a call log.  But there is no perfection in the world.  For example, when creating a list of favorite recipients, sms will try to send by default to all participants in the list.  Or when choosing a recipient from the call log, all the numbers there are dumped into a mess without an indication, you called or you called.  I also liked the fact that when you click on the green button, you are not in the list of the last dialed numbers, in the list of all the calls from their journal (both dialed and received and missed).  Here everything is beautifully marked with icons - beautifully and clearly!  In general, there are no special complaints about the interface of the phone book, call log and SMS messages, everything is done reasonably and conveniently enough. <br>  The quality of communication apparatus has no complaints.  Reception confident, the interlocutor is heard well.  Here at 6700 full order. <br><br>  <b>Let's do the multimedia functions of the device.</b>  The strongest side here is the camera.  It is not just 5-megapixel, it is really quite good in a number of other mobile phone cameras.  Of course, good shots are obtained only during the day and only on the street.  Indoors and at dusk, the camera is simply lost and ceases to produce something intelligible, similar to a photograph.  The autofocus misses are very frequent in the room, and the flash on the phone is small enough and it doesn‚Äôt hurt that powerful.  It also seemed to me that the photographs have a bias in the white balance in blue.  It, as well as the contrast and color saturation can be adjusted in Photoshop.  Unfortunately, the quality of the camera in many cases is leveled by an unsuccessful photo button, which I already wrote about above.  You can take pictures and the central button of the joystick, but then autofocus will not work. <br><br>  An example of a photo (the link is the original photo): <br> <a href="http://img-fotki.yandex.ru/get/3902/ch-tim.20/0_348ce_51908530_orig"><img src="http://img-fotki.yandex.ru/get/3902/ch-tim.20/0_348ce_51908530_XL" alt="image"></a> <br><br>  Interestingly, the phone has the ability to pop from the camera to preview photos.  And here the photos are not a list with sketches and titles, as in the gallery, but only a matrix of sketches. <br>  The camera settings are quite poor, which is surprising for such a good camera. In addition to the usual photo quality, you can adjust only the white balance and brightness.  There are also effects <br>  The camera also shoots a fairly decent quality video format 640 by 480 pixels.  The main drawback is the 3gp format, and not the currently accepted mp4.  This affects both the quality of the video and the further use of clips (the 3gp format is quite versatile). <br>  It is very convenient that the camera and video camera are separated into separate labels.  This greatly speeds up the launch. <br>  The photo gallery on the phone is combined with an internal file manager.  There are no specific functions in it.  The list of photos shows a small thumbnail, the name of the file, its size and the date it was taken.  Scaling is not very convenient. <br><br>  On the phone, you can watch the video, and, most surprisingly, 6700 digested without problems and showed a mp4 video clip in 640x480 resolution (this is with a 320x240 pixel screen) and a high bitrate, which I encoded for 5800. But I don‚Äôt think something comes to mind watching a movie on such a sufficiently microscopic screen.  Still remains a mystery for me, for which the possibility of a video player in the background? <br><br>  The phone also has a regular, but equipped with all the necessary functions of the player.  He also has playlists, including automatic ones (by artist, album, genre), an equalizer, random play and looping.  There is only one external speaker on the phone.  He yells decently, even with a margin of volume, but the sound is not pleasant - the usual screaming speaker of a regular phone.  The sound quality in the headphones remains a mystery to me.  The phone does not have a standard output for 3.5 mm headphones.  There are only 2.5 mm.  and shit headphones, in which listening to music is just a crime, and neither good headphones with a 2.5 mm jack, nor an adapter to the standard jack was on my hands. <br><br>  Of the additional features is to cancel the radio and GPS-receiver, working with Nokia Maps.  Out of the box in the phone there are several games and several Java applications designed to exchange information through online services.  To check all these applications are nothing more than the tabs in a standard browser.  There are no interesting applications in the phone. <br><br>  <b>Let's try to sum up some of the results.</b>  First of all, the Nokia 6700 Classic is an image solution focused on a person who uses mostly phone functions.  The phone is certainly beautiful, stylish, fashionable, glamorous ... Of the shortcomings, I would most of all note the incredibly lousy look in which the phone resides most of the time.  Agree, for the image tube is a rather serious drawback.  Another strength is the built-in camera, albeit with rather poor settings and a disgusting focus / shooting button.  It is on these 2 strengths that you should focus your attention on potential buyers.  For the rest, we face a strong middling - a regular tube that can do a lot, but almost everything has significant limitations.  If you need a high-quality functional audio / video center, then the 6700 is unlikely to be your ideal choice.  It is worth looking at other options.  But what can be said for sure is that there are a lot of functional tubes, but there are very few really beautiful devices.  So, the release of 6700 will not go unnoticed, which already confirms the active interest of customers and sales results. <br><habracut></habracut></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/79362/">https://habr.com/ru/post/79362/</a></p>
