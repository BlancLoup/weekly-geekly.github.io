  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Problems in the eBay chain, Mail, Russia</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"> Read a useful post. <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/ebay/123364/">Think twice before clicking the ‚ÄúBuy it now‚Äù button on Ebay</a> .  At first I wanted to supplement it with a commentary with my experience, but then I realized that there were a few different situations. <br><br>  So, I will share my observations on ebay from the point of view of a person who lives in Russia. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  In short: since 2006, on ebay, I registered first just to gawk, ask around.  Perhaps something to pay through intermediaries.  The first purchase and made by the way.  Then PayPal decided to allow residents of Russia to spend money and I got my card and account in this payment system.  Verification of the address, I note, was at first serious: I not only entered the code from my card statement, but also sent scans of documents where my full name appears + address (in my opinion it was an insurance policy) and only after reviewing the documents I was given an account.  Slowly there were purchases, bought not often and mostly on trifles (hardware for the company, player).  Gradually emboldened, he began to take things at a more serious price of $ 150-250.  Good luck accompanied me and I successfully received even the ordered new PDA, sealed in a factory box, for which neither customs nor the post office were willing to receive.  Then everything went, too, not very bad, but blunders began to appear - part of the parcels did not get.  That's actually about it and tell. <br><br>  <u>Situation 1.</u> Ordered not very expensive thing (something about $ 50).  A month has passed, two, three no parcels.  Due to inexperience, I did not know that the dispute could be opened 60 days after the purchase (now 45 days).  The package was without tracking, which then did not bother me.  There is no money, no parcel - I don‚Äôt even know its fate, either the seller didn‚Äôt send it at all, or it was lost by mail.

      <br>
      Then came a wave of successful purchases.  As it was forgotten, the more the amount is not large. <br><br>  <u>Situation 2.</u> An order worth almost $ 600, car parts.  Shipped by FedEx with tracking number.  The parcel arrived in Moscow successfully and it sank into oblivion.  When contacting FedEx, I received an answer - the parcel was destroyed, as it was not possible to catch the addressee at home for a certain time.  I didn‚Äôt expect such a trick from FedEx, especially since I don‚Äôt live in Moscow, so I didn‚Äôt try to deliver the package.  I start to understand: the seller indicated on the parcel a completely different address, but my full name as the recipient.  I am writing to the seller, to which I get the answer - we will deal with FedEx.  I strictly follow the deadlines for opening a dispute, I write a couple more letters to the seller - he has no results.  I open the dispute, attach the tracking number, my address, describe the situation.  The issue is decided in favor of the seller.  I appeal the decision, explain in more detail what the problem is, what is where and how.  I get a response similar to the following: ebay clarified the status of the parcel from FedEx and its fate, but indeed the address was not specified, but the parcel arrived in Moscow - the seller fulfilled his obligations - delivered the parcel to my country, and then it seems like ebay disowns - our competence.  The dispute is closed completely and irrevocably, the money was not returned, the parcels either.  In their opinion, I should have started to sound the alarm earlier, before the package was destroyed. <br><br>  Again there are successful purchases. <br><br>  <u>Situation 3.</u> Purchase for $ 400, a new iphone 3GS.  The seller immediately after the purchase says that the phones often disappear during shipment and honestly warns in advance, especially the trouble with the iphone.  This is certainly not news, but it does not stop me.  Together we decide to take some measures.  The phone is unpacked, all protective stickers are removed, the phone is marked as used phone, no iphone is written anywhere.  The seller packs the phone in a package for the EMS service.  He sends me pictures: a phone, a parcel with my address, a parcel on a scale with exact weight.  Departure is insured for the amount of $ 400.  The parcel went. <br><br>  Everything goes perfectly to our customs.  The parcel goes through customs and ... disappears.  No longer going anywhere.  Conversation with EMS support service, a lot of water is of little use.  I am making an application for the search parcel.  I read forums at the same time, they write how our customs and EMS employees like all kinds of knick-knacks from Apple.  The term of the dispute comes to an end, it makes no sense to open it, since the whole truth is on the seller‚Äôs side.  It takes 1.5 months and the EMS confesses that ‚Äúthe parcel has been lost at the sorting station‚Äù.  I am trying to figure out how I can get insurance now - the question confuses, the support asks to stay on the line until they consult with a specialist.  The first time they say that you need a statement from me.  After some time, I received an official paper about the loss, I decided to clarify the form of the application from the caliper.  I call the second time, again with the advice of a specialist.  This time I can‚Äôt get insurance - the sender can get it, but I can ask him for a statement on the refusal of insurance in my favor.  The question of the form of the application and the problem of the language barrier baffles the caliper.  They consult again - the answer is, only the sender and period can receive insurance.  I am writing to the seller about the problem, he submits an application to the US EMS service.  At the moment, waiting with him insurance.  To the word seller, Power Seller is mainly on phones, the rating is about 6000, so there is every reason to get insurance, but of course there is a risk. <br><br>  2 successful purchases and again problems. <br><br>  <u>Situation 4.</u> Buying a car radio for $ 200.  I bought, I try to pay - I get an error about the impossibility of making a payment.  Bank support says the payment goes to PayPal and comes back almost instantly.  I am writing to PayPal, the answer is to clean the cookies, wait a bit, the problem should be gone.  2 days - payment does not pass.  I am writing to the seller, he writes one sentence in response that he accepts money only with a confirmed account.  I am writing again on PayPal that the setting in the seller‚Äôs account can be some kind of money reception.  The answer is that ‚Äúoh yes, they forgot, maybe this, you are from Russia.  And there is no way to check the address in Russia, therefore, the confirmation now only gives for linking to the card (and not as it was before, when I sent the documents), because the seller may not accept such ‚Äúconditionally‚Äù confirmed accounts. ‚ÄùI was sure that in terms of payment, the inhabitants of Russia were equated with the other participants of PayPal, but it turns out that it was not there.  But I have never met such a problem before.  As a result, the seller refused to issue an invoice for payment directly through PayPal, as the eBay support recommended (he also corresponded with them).  Now he asked the seller to cancel the transaction, but he has not done it yet.  So it is not clear how the situation will be resolved. <br><br>  Conclusions from all these situations: <br><br>  1. How to choose a seller has already been written 100 times, I don‚Äôt repeat myself, but I‚Äôll add that you need to understand before buying, not only which vendor to choose, but also that buying at auction is always a risk, bigger or smaller, but the risk is not getting , for what money is paid is always, with any insurance and delivery methods. <br><br>  2. Control the dead-line disputes, do not forget to fight for items purchased and money spent. <br><br>  3. Before sending a parcel to a more or less significant amount, ask the seller for a photograph of the parcel, its contents, address sticker, the weight of the parcel, as well as a photo of the receipt for mail services on the seller‚Äôs side.  This will help in disputes with the mail in case of loss of the parcel. <br><br>  4. Insure the shipment, order the shipment with a tracking number.  In the case of sending the parcel without it, the seller has more chances to leave with the money. <br><br>  As far as I know it is by this principle that fraud is built (as it was recently from Amazon Kindle for $ 30), the package seems to have been sent, but without a tracking number.  In this case, the seller after 30 days can withdraw money from PayPal for the lot.  Even if you open a dispute, the seller can always say that the package is on the way and provide a couple of photos of the packed package.  And after 30 days, the seller doesn‚Äôt care about your disputes and negative reviews - he already took the money.  Connoisseurs correct, if I did not correctly describe the principle of the scheme - this is just my assumption based on the trick with the tracking number. <br><br>  I have everything on this for now, I think from the comments something will definitely be added to this post. <br><br>  <b>UPD 1.</b> Situation 4 was resolved by the fact that the seller canceled the transaction at my request, and the world dispersed. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/123419/">https://habr.com/ru/post/123419/</a></p>
