  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Comparison of HP ProLiant DL360 Gen6 and HP ProLiant DL360 Gen8. What do we pay more for?</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  The progress of computer technology today is not just not in place - it is sometimes not so easy to keep track of its course.  The driving force here has long been market competition.  It is not enough to create a product a bit better than that of competing firms - you need to think in advance about the strategy for further development in order to become a guideline and a legislator in this struggle.  It is required that the next generation of technology meets the needs of consumers and puzzled the competitors following on the heels of it.  As for the users themselves, for them the pursuit of high-tech fashion flies in a pretty penny.  Today, becoming the owner of the latest technology, it is difficult to say how long it will be possible to rest on the laurels of a leader, because it can become obsolete overnight.  What is an example of competition in the market of mobile technologies, which has turned into a competition of cults, sometimes devoid of practical sense, as a blind tribute to the image?  As well as among the general mass, inside the developing companies there is also the concept of image, but here the race for ever-renewing generations of computer equipment can become ruinous.  In this area, sober analysis and common sense are in high esteem. <br><br>  Hewlett-Packard has taken a leading position in the server hardware market.  Her approach to the development of user needs has become truly progressive.  There was an opportunity to complete the existing equipment instead of completely replacing it, as the needs grow.  Thus, the needs of an organization for quite a long time can be met on time by a complete server of a generation that has long since left the market, which helps save a lot of money. <br><br>  In the market for used server hardware, the question of the feasibility of acquiring a particular model remains very urgent.  By itself, the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãsuch a market implies minimization of costs upon presentation of certain requirements for equipment, based on the needs of the consumer.  HP ProLiant DL360 has become the most purchased server model in this segment, this article is devoted to the analysis of 2 generations.  DL360 servers have high computational power and fault tolerance, which makes it possible to use these models in fairly large information processing centers with a small area, and provide enterprise-class dual-processor performance while saving space in a compact 1U form factor. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/df0/696/77f/df069677f2d14e18b67c38f4ecb4b055.jpg">

      But is it worth it at a certain stage of development of an organization to purchase a newer and much more expensive <a href="http://westcomp.ru/catalog/servery_hp_proliant_dl360_1u/hp_proliant_dl360p_gen8_2x2_3ghz_six_core_xeon_e5_2630_32gb_4x8_pc3_10600_no_hdd_sas_sa_p420_2_pws/">HP ProLiant DL360 Gen8</a> model instead of the <a href="http://westcomp.ru/catalog/servery_hp_proliant_dl360_1u/hp_proliant_dl360g6_2x2_67ggts_xeon_six_core_kh5650_48gb_6x8_ddr3_pc3_10600_no_hdd_sas_sa_p800_2_pws/">HP ProLiant DL360 Gen6 model</a> ?  The answer to this question can only give a comparative analysis of these models. <br><br>  Buying a commentary on the tabular comparative characteristics of the limit configurations immediately reveals all the trump cards of the 8th generation of these servers.  Yes, it is understandable, because in the race for new solutions do not stint on the improvement of the basic parameters. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/d55/b3b/ee4/d55b3bee4e84427a917092bcf8c959b2.jpg"><br><br>  That only the 8-core Intel Xeon E5 processor and the greatly expanded RAM are worth, and it‚Äôs not even possible to talk about the new remote administration system <a href="http://westcomp.ru/articles/13264/">iLO</a> 4 and much lower power consumption.  Obviously, in terms of its potential, the DL360 G8 is significantly superior to its predecessor.  But a logical question arises: how justified is such an increase in functionality at a certain stage of development of a user's organization, given the cost of both servers? <br>  <a href="http://westcomp.ru/">WestComp</a> has been in the used computer equipment market for more than 10 years.  Since the very idea of ‚Äã‚Äãthis market is in strict observance of the balance of "price-quality", the company has set itself the task of finding out whether the DL360 G8 server is worth buying instead of DL360 G6.  Since no global tasks of the in-depth review were made, a comparative analysis of the two servers was also carried out without frills with the help of the long-proven powerful diagnostic tool - the Aida64 software package, also known as Everest.  On the question of the technical characteristics of the tested servers, the two most purchased configurations were taken as a basis. <cut><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/b0d/55d/a58/b0d55da58f3843f88da7394c789f240d.jpg"><br><br>  The benchmark Cache &amp; Memory Benchmark, as expected, confirmed the superiority of the 8th generation in all positions, but the gap, note, is not the most significant.  In light of this difference in parameters, the superiority of the server of the 8th generation, although it was fixed by a specialized program, will not necessarily be noticeable in the process of the two servers.  So is it worth twice or even three times to overpay for such minor differences?  The conclusion may seem obvious - not worth it!  But depending on the prioritization is not so simple.  For supporters of remote administration, it will be more convenient to use the 8th generation DL360, because iLO 4 provides much easier access to managing server settings.  The thing is that the iLO 2 control panel needs to be configured in detail, unlike its later version.  In addition, iLO 4 contains some additional diagnostic capabilities.  Thus, if you prefer to maintain a distance in comfort in managing an organization, the DL360 Gen8 will help you. <br><br>  The conclusions made above reflect a purely subjective point of view and are based on the practice of our company.  In the light of recent changes in exchange rates and the overall "squeeze" of the market, companies are increasingly beginning to pay attention to the functionality of the purchased equipment. </cut></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/264547/">https://habr.com/ru/post/264547/</a></p>
