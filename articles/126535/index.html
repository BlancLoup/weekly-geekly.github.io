I created this topic, because I do not know what else I can try to solve my problem, and also because there are a lot of smart people sitting here. <br><br>  I will soon be 30, and I feel that I was stumped.  I had many problems and, fortunately, I solved most of them with the help of a very good school psychologist.  I never went to college, spent several years jumping from one dismal job to another.  Now engaged in sales.

      I myself learned to program on the old Commodore Amiga.  Since then I have learned many different languages ‚Äã‚Äãon several platforms.  Over the years I have started countless projects ‚Äî more than I can remember.  The problem is that <i>I haven't finished any of them</i> .  I either spent several weeks or months refactoring and rewriting the code, or, more often, when I finished writing the code, I gave up, instead of starting to design, documenting and debugging.  The same thing is happening in other areas of my life.  Homemade, travel plans, education, career ... It all starts, but none of this is completed. <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  I am ready to cry when I think about all my attempts made over the course of many years ... What could have happened if I had stopped at any particular project!  I used to think that reading Habr would help.  It was supposed to teach me that to create at least something better than not to create anything, but everything turned out exactly the opposite.  Due to the fact that other people are able to see the essence of things, but I can not, I cursed myself.  Sometimes it ended in complete stagnation, then all day I was peeping at the TV or playing computer games. <br><br>  I tried everything that came into my head.  Therapy, self-development, hypnosis, a million motivational books, blogs, applications and techniques.  I learned everything I found on Google, I tried most of these things.  It does not help anything.  I am at a dead end and I do not see the light at the end of the tunnel.  I feel like the character of Bill Murray in "Groundhog Day." <br><br>  Please habrovchane, if someone went through something like this or can offer something that I could try, please write.  I no longer want life to pass by me.  Help! <br><br><h6>  update </h6><br>  Changed the title, the original was ‚ÄúPerfectionism destroyed ...‚Äù, but from the topic you can see that it's not about him. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/126535/">https://habr.com/ru/post/126535/</a></p>
