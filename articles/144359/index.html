  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Publishing an application to Android Market</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Good or bad, but for Android applications there are a large number of different sales markets.  On the one hand, we have to publish in several, on the other - the coverage is provided wider.  When I thought that it would be time to use alternative markets for my <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details%3Fid%3Dcom.mopon.ru.frebies">application</a> , I did not find any sensible information.  I just want to warn you that the program is designed for a narrow Russian-speaking audience, it is absolutely unremarkable, it is in fact an ordinary rss-reader for my <a href="http://mopon.ru/">freebie site</a> .  Those.  for many, this experience will not be indicative.  Also, I did not use any means to promote my application (advertising, reviews, cheat). <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Once again I want to warn you that the post is not for the bigwigs of the market, but only for those who, like me, timidly opens the world of Android applications from the opposite side of the normal user. <br>  The application is published on: <br>  <b>Forum w3bsit3-dns.com</b> <br>  <b>Google play</b> <br>  <b>Amazon App Store</b> <br>  <b>Samsung Apps Store</b> <br>  <b>Blackberry App World</b> <br>  There are also <a href="http://developer.vodafone.com/publish/">Vodafone</a> and <a href="http://developer.verizon.com/">Verizon</a> markets, but they are not suitable for Russian-language software. <br><br>  Initially, I ‚Äúsqueezed‚Äù $ 25 for registration on Google Play, because  believed that for my application, these expenses will never pay off.  Therefore, I begin the review with a strange at first glance, but perhaps an important way of distributing your program. <br><br>  <a href="http://4pda.ru/forum/index.php%3Fshowforum%3D281">Forum w3bsit3-dns.com</a> , dedicated to Android software and devices is the most popular resource in the CIS about Android.  Publishing a topic is insanely simple.  Go to the general (not thematic, moderators themselves will transfer) section or about the games, or about the programs and click "New Topic".  There is an available template that a housewife can fill in. <br>  On the one hand, you can say that this is just a forum, but in fact, if you distribute a free application, then posting it on w3bsit3-dns.com, you will almost automatically receive publications on dozens of other websites dedicated to Android.  Of course, for the most part these are scarcely visited resources, but this is really free placement, for which you practically have nothing to do.  Recently I was asked how to get to the top in Google Play (my application is in the top of free social).  I replied that high marks plus thousands of downloads themselves raise.  But before the publication of this article, I thought that perhaps the frequent mentions on the net also had their effect. <br>  The theme was created in early February 2012. For 4 months, the number of downloads from the forum did not even reach a hundred.  At the same time, the attendance of the resource after publication has doubled (from 100 unique to 200). <br>  Pros: <br><ul><li>  Easy to publish </li><li>  The post is published immediately, do not wait for approval </li><li>  You get a free feedback test for your application. </li><li>  Crossposting on thematic resources </li></ul><br>  Minuses: <br><ul><li>  The number of downloads is very small </li><li>  You lose users who could download the application on Google Play and make you a counter. </li><li>  Only suitable for free software </li></ul>

      <a href="http://play.google.com/apps/publish">Google Play</a> is certainly the most important market for distribution, but a lot has been said about it as well as about publication in the former Android Market.  Honestly, I expected that there will be no more downloads than from the forum w3bsit3-dns.com, so I did not rush to google play.  But since  I started developing a full-fledged application and understood that I would have to part with $ 25 anyway in a month or two, then why not try this application? <br>  In connection with the presence of detailed reviews about the publication in this market, I will just write a few of my thoughts: <br>  <b>The</b> application <b>icon</b> really matters.  Initially, it was selected in any way unsuitable on the subject.  After the change to normal, the peak of downloads was reached, despite the fact that the application had been in the market for a couple of weeks and enjoyed relatively stable demand. <br>  <b>Comments</b> are completely different.  At first, I reacted to them, I was a little worried about units, but after 50 assessments I realized that people are just too different.  Constructive comments are very few.  And further.  People who put the five write comments very rarely.  Those that put the unit, they write almost always.  In this case, the fives are detailed comments, and the units: ‚ÄúTuff‚Äù, ‚ÄúGarbage‚Äù, etc. <br>  Rating statistics: <img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/f7b/0f3/75c/f7b0f375c7f1b24b48761d634fa8c06c.jpg"><br>  Google Play <b>Search</b> leaves much to be desired.  I heard that the App Store is also a problem, but I have no experience.  Then I just can‚Äôt imagine how users find the program.  No search analytics, unfortunately, no.  An application called ‚ÄúFreebies, Free Stuff <a href="https://play.google.com/store/search%3Fq%3D%25D0%25A5%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BB%25D1%258F%25D0%25B2%25D0%25B0%26c%3Dapps">‚Äù</a> cannot be found at the request of <a href="https://play.google.com/store/search%3Fq%3D%25D0%25A5%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BB%25D1%258F%25D0%25B2%25D0%25B0%26c%3Dapps">‚ÄúFreebies‚Äù</a> .  Instead, there is anything from free live wallpapers to the Ebay application.  On request <a href="https://play.google.com/store/search%3Fq%3D%25D0%25B1%25D0%25B5%25D1%2581%25D0%25BF%25D0%25BB%25D0%25B0%25D1%2582%25D0%25BD%25D1%258B%25D0%25B5%2B%25D0%25B2%25D0%25B5%25D1%2589%25D0%25B8%26c%3Dapps">"free stuff" is</a> now the first place, but this is a month later.  At first, I could only find using the site address in the request. <br>  <b>Paying</b> $ 25 does not mean that you immediately get the opportunity to publish your programs.  At first there will be a not very friendly inscription, the meaning of which is that you have not been checked yet.  I hung it for a day, tired, and I wrote a letter to the support.  The next day everything was fine, but I received no response from the support. <br>  However, the <b>download statistics</b> turned out to be incredible for this type of application.  I even had to change the hosting. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/379/4da/b7a/3794dab7a25966b5f4a4a9c2074d34f5.jpg"><br>  Pros: <br><ul><li>  Quick registration </li><li>  Huge market </li><li>  The relative ease of hitting the thematic top and the top "gaining popularity" </li></ul><br>  Minuses: <br><ul><li>  Registration fee </li><li>  Get sensible feedback is almost unreal </li></ul><br>  <a href="https://developer.amazon.com/login.html">Amazon App Store Amazon app</a> store.  It seemed to me that in Russia there is already a decent amount of Kindle Fire and many people have already installed this market because of the distribution of paid applications for free (such as Plants vs Zombies).  I also thought that because  alternative markets are not spoiled by a large number of users, they will care more about their developers than google or apple.  In fact, it turned out to be completely wrong :) Registration in Amazon takes a little less than a week.  Almost as many will be checking your downloaded application.  And Amazon warns that this is only the first year of registration is free.  Then every year you will have to pay. <br>  The first time my program was not accepted, because  The description was in Russian.  In Amazon, you can ONLY in English.  The only thing you can enter Cyrillic - keywords.  Accordingly, if you have a Russian-language application, there is no point in going to the Amazon App store.  After changing the description and title to English, a second check takes several more days and the application is published in the market.  A few days later it gets into the market for the Kindle Fire.  But downloads are discouraged: <img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/70f/a7e/649/70fa7e649c42f66216212062b78dddc2.jpg"><br>  Pros: <br><ul><li>  They say that paid apps buy better than on Google Play </li><li>  Competition below </li></ul><br>  Minuses: <br><ul><li>  Only English software </li><li>  Registration and applet take a lot of time </li><li>  The market is smaller than on Google Play </li><li>  Further annual contributions </li></ul><br>  <a href="http://seller.samsungapps.com/">Samsung Apps Store</a> market from the largest to date, the manufacturer of phones in the world.  Because  All Android smartphones come with a pre-installed App Store, the market looks very large.  In fact, the disappointment of trying (otherwise it's hard to call it) using this market exceeded even amazon app store. <br>  On May 8, I tried to register and download my application.  Everything went as usual until the last step, in which I received the message "Failed update service status (complete)".  Having badly broken his head, having tested various spellings of the name and other things, he decided to write a support ticket.  They answered quite quickly in a few hours.  But here is the answer.  At first I did not even understand him.  The bottom line was that they knew about the problem and were waiting for it to be resolved on May 17 (!).  Those.  a company like Samsung needs at least 10 days to solve the problem of the impossibility of publishing applications on its market.  Honestly, I didn‚Äôt even think that this was possible :) After they had solved their problems, I had to go back to the seller office and press this last button. <br>  Further more.  You cannot make your application available to all devices at once.  There are about a dozen categories that differ in resolution.  Want to make the program available for all devices - create a dozen publications. <br>  When I saw the number of checks that the Samsung exposes the application, I could not hold back a smile.  I hope it will be published by Christmas))) <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/472/836/448/4728364483f632f02bc09153e3bdb288.jpg"><br>  Accordingly, no downloads - nothing. <br>  Pros: <br><ul><li>  Potentially market exists </li><li>  Free registration :) </li></ul><br>  Minuses: <br><ul><li>  The road to the Samsung App Store is incredibly long </li><li>  The fragmentation of devices makes you create multiple publications. </li><li>  The market is smaller than on Google Play </li></ul><br>  <a href="https://appworld.blackberry.com/isvportal/vendor/reg_terms.do">Blackberry App World</a> market for Blackberry.  It's a bit strange to see it in the review of the market for Android, right?  Nevertheless, RIM made it possible to convert apk to bar.  And it can be done <a href="https://bdsc.webapps.blackberry.com/android/bpaa/">online</a> .  Five minutes and we have a cross-platform application :) In fact, I did not see the meaning of the application distribution in Blackberry App World.  I was just wondering if the conversion works and how the Blackberry market works.  The prevalence of this platform in Russia is extremely low.  I myself kept the RIM smartphone only a couple of times in my life when I worked as an enikeyschik at one large factory (standard for top managers).  Now Playbook tablets have appeared, which in Russia, it seems to me, are mostly distributed only because RIM sent them to developers for free. <br>  Registration is free, but they require a scan of your passport.  The purpose of this for me is foggy, I threw a scan of an expired oversea transom - it took a ride (it took 4 days to check).  Next we publish the application.  Here, of course, the delays are due to my lack of knowledge of specifics, but I will tell you how it is.  Here, unlike Samsung, you can select all devices in a crowd.  And phones, and tablets.  They also give you the option to choose the minimum OS.  I chose everything and set the OS to 1.0. <br>  The first answer from the support came with a refusal, because  similar applications are not supported on OS 1.0.  Changed to OS 2.0 and sent again.  The following failures were due to the fact that the bar format is supported only for Playbook tablets.  I went again, removed the phone, sent it to check.  Checked, accepted.  The whole process took five days.  Given the 2 failure period for me is normal.  Zaappruvili and forgot. <br>  Recently I went to see, but there are downloads.  Let a little, but there is.  And even a positive review left.  Users are not spoiled by a large number of applications and are ready to use what is. <br>  Downloads: <img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/dd7/f7b/6b6/dd7f7b6b63bf14373f5302aa9ae6da9d.jpg"><br>  Pros: <br><ul><li>  Competition is very low </li><li>  Free registration </li><li>  Periodically there are contests for developers. </li><li>  Online application conversion for a new platform </li></ul><br>  Minuses: <br><ul><li>  Not common in Russia </li><li>  RIM gradually dies </li></ul><br><br>  From this I concluded that the application is focused on the Russian-speaking population, there is no big point in publishing in alternative markets.  At the same time, Google play and w3bsit3-dns.com are good places to host.  If the application is in English, the results may be different. <br>  I hope that my experience will be useful to someone. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/144359/">https://habr.com/ru/post/144359/</a></p>
