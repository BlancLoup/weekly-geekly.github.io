  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Keepers: Review of Credit Card Storage Applications</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Despite the fact that mobile acquiring terminals such as <a href="http://squareup.com/">Square</a> or <a href="http://2can.ru/">2can</a> allow you to accept payment cards simply by signing on the screen of a smartphone or tablet, our life is still literally crammed with all sorts of account numbers, passwords, PIN codes and other confidential information that we need remember and track.  Passwords for frequently visited websites, credit cards, bank accounts, passwords for social networks or specialized groups, driver's license number, passport and insurance are just a small number of examples of information that sometimes we need. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/47d/5ca/5e0/47d5ca5e08dcff78365b1cf2efe315e4.png"></div><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  How often do you hear that ‚Äúfor security reasons‚Äù you should not use the same password or pin code for all accounts?  And also, that for greater security, the password should contain a combination of letters and numbers.  Also, the password, ideally, should consist of more than eight characters.  Different register.  And, to finally secure yourself, use at least one special character.  Are they serious? .. Multiply the number of options by the number of your accounts and you quickly realize that it is not possible to keep in memory all these multi-character combinations.  Writing passwords on a piece of paper to better remember or recall on occasion, taking a hint from under the keyboard, is altogether counterproductive. <br>  For the average man in the street to remember this amount of information can be a doable task, but it is very boring.  Fortunately, there are applications for the iPhone and iPad, created to help people safely store and organize access to all sources of sensitive data so that the information is available then when it is necessary, but it is reliably protected and encrypted from unauthorized access.

    <h4>  Applications for secure storage of information on iOS devices </h4><br>  The AppStore is full of security related applications.  At first glance it may even seem that they are generally the same, as they implement a simple procedure.  But not all of them are equally useful and each offers a unique set of features that make usage more specialized.  In the end, we need to know what to pay for. <br><br><h4>  Top apps </h4><hr><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/2d6/f48/02b/2d6f4802bf69073a6732cdc531515c86.png" align="left"><h4>  1Password, 579 rubles </h4><br>  If you have ever forgotten your password, then you know how unpleasant and annoying the recovery procedure is (especially when it comes to the PIN code to a bank card).  With the application 1Password, you will need to remember only one password.  This password will open access to the application in which all other passwords will be stored.  This application can also generate a strong, unique password for each site.  It has a built-in browser and saves other types of personal data, such as credit card, passport and bank account numbers.  The fact that 1Password is a universal application and is synchronized with a computer makes it one of the most loved by users. <br><br><br clear="all"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/3e4/45d/b27/3e445db27437ed1783c11ab8610e63f0.png" align="left"><h4>  Wallet, 329 rubles. </h4><br>  Wallet is an application that stores and encrypts your passwords, credit card numbers, serial numbers, and so on.  All information is synchronized securely via Dropbox or another WebDev server.  For the price of just $ 10, the Wallet is an excellent replacement for 1Pwordword at a lower price.  Even the Mac version costs less than a similar solution from 1Password, which makes Wallet an even more useful and attractive solution. <br><br><br clear="all"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/f81/ebe/688/f81ebe688e50d5eaf54caef3538c8a55.png" align="left"><h4>  mSecure, 329 rubles </h4><br>  256-bit encryption and a whole set of tools for conveniently saving passwords and account numbers.  In addition, the proprietary technology to protect cloud data, independent of the reliability of the ‚Äúcloud‚Äù itself, backup by sending to e-mail, optional data destruction when attempting to hack.  The highest rating in the AppStore. <br><br><br clear="all"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/109/883/a68/109883a688cbafb41d0ab86c21ad5f08.png" align="left"><h4>  oneSafe, 199 rub </h4><br>  This nice universal app uses iCloud for syncing.  Retaining the same functionality as 1Password, OneSafe and mSecure, this program uses all the features of iOS to give the user a convenient and functional interface, coupled with intuitive navigation.  iCloud works great, which makes this app a winner in this review.  oneSafe is probably one of the best apps of its kind for iOS. <br><br><br clear="all"><h4>  Worth paying attention </h4><hr><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/32b/8eb/ce5/32b8ebce5c9f1581e5c859e19c6cdcce.png" align="left"><h4>  DataVault Password Manager, 329 rubles. </h4><br>  DataVault is a worthy replacement for 1Password.  The application provides for easy migration by importing data from 1Password, eWallet, SplashID, mSecure, IE, Firefox, Roboform, and other applications through Windows or Mac software.  The application allows you to synchronize data via MobileMe, WebDAV, local Wi-Fi and file sharing.  It can also store various data formats, including passwords, credit cards, frequent flyer cards, bank accounts, and much more.  This program has a pretty nice interface, but not as beautiful and elegant as 1Password. <br><br><br clear="all"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/80a/bd6/095/80abd6095104e28782fd1b6d7a398d0c.png" align="left"><h4>  eWallet, 329 rubles </h4><br>  The application performs all the same functions as the previous ones, but does it in a spartan and utilitarian way.  If you are looking for true beauty, then this is not your choice.  If you are a supporter of a practical approach, then this is a great application.  Includes 256-bit encryption, a keeper of all passwords, synchronization via Wi-Fi, provided you are on the same network, and an automatic password generator. <br><br><br clear="all"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/198/68b/957/19868b957bf22458c17cce025530a0bf.png" align="left"><h4>  AllYourPasswords, 33 rub </h4><br>  This application best describes the feedback of one of the users in the AppStore: ‚ÄúGreat application, what you need, on the subject, without whistles :)‚Äù The functionality is standard, low price. <br><br clear="all"><hr><br><br><h4>  How to protect the contents of the wallet using these applications? </h4><br>  Once you have installed one of these programs, start by walking through the contents of your wallet.  Enter in the application account numbers and additional information about each debit and credit card, as well as all ID cards and club cards.  For each cell, enter the support telephone number in case of loss or theft. <br>  Subsequently, if you ever lose your wallet or steal it, you will have a complete list of missing items with phone numbers in order to block the cards and order new ones.  You will not spend a lot of time looking for numbers of all organizations that were recorded on maps.  Simple but effective solution.  What to do if your phone was stolen?  - do not worry, because at least you have a wallet and a backup copy of the data on the network. <br><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Other applications:</b> <div class="spoiler_text"><table><tbody><tr><td width="400"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/2d9/dae/9d2/2d9dae9d2eb0d00fdeafea91e4e81162.png" align="left">  Blasphemous Password <br>  by Interactive Blasphemy LLC <br>  Issued: about 3 years ago </td><td><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/e76/abc/a14/e76abca14b775451f5d1af83eeb98657.png" align="left">  Cozi Password Vault <br>  by cozi <br>  Released: 6 months ago </td></tr><tr><td><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/0aa/8ad/08e/0aa8ad08e358c03926c5ded22a83ae46.png" align="left">  iKeePass <br>  from fusenigk.de GmbH <br>  Released: over 3 years ago </td><td><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/6ec/2e5/538/6ec2e55389ba78404dd43ab615fafe10.png" align="left">  iPassworder HD <br>  by Dmitrij Vinokurov <br>  Issued: about 2 years ago </td></tr><tr><td><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/fa9/e76/06c/fa9e7606cde99785623f1d026d9286de.png" align="left">  iPIN - Secure PIN &amp;
