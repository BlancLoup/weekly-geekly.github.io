  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Bigthink.com - a startup for intellectuals and thinkers, then what could become top4top</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Recently, a new American startup, Bigthink.com, has opened, which is positioned as a site for intellectuals and thinkers.  Founder Peter Hopkins was able to find investors for his idea of ‚Äã‚Äã‚Äúmaking Youtube for intellectuals.‚Äù  Although many venture investors told him: ‚ÄúEveryone says that Americans are stupid‚Äù.  The site contains video interviews with well-known intellectuals from various areas of politics, economics, and business.  Each user can join the debate and add their opinion on any issue.  The founders have plans to add social opportunities in the manner of Facebook to the site in the future. Original news on <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2008/01/07/thoughts-about-bigthink/">techcrunch</a> and an article in <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/01/07/technology/07summers.html%3Fpagewanted%3D1%26_r%3D2">Nytimes</a> <br>  My impressions of the site. <a name="habracut"></a>  The idea, which had been in the air for a long time, was finally implemented qualitatively and interestingly.  The site has two user groups - experts and regular users.  Among the invited professors, businessmen, activists of public organizations, politicians, officials.  For example, billionaire Richard Branson, or the former director of the CIA.  Each of them is asked one question and within two to three minutes they answer it.  Users can ask their questions, add their comments, videos, audio clips or images.  Such a format seemed strange to me, well, except for platitudes, you can have time to say in a few minutes?  Well, let's see.  Your questions or topics for discussion can be created in specific sections.  Strongly resembles an advanced forum structure.  Of course there are extended tags.  Although the content is now small, but the idea and implementation is good, attracted famous people, now the main thing is to moderate, develop and attract people.  From me, a big plus project.  There are similar projects <a href="http://www.ted.com/">www.ted.com</a> , where every week they post a video program with a presentation or an interview with a scientist, a politician, a businessman about new trends and ideas, the site allows commenting on the programs, but there are practically no social functions at all.  There is also a site <a href="http://www.fora.tv/">www.fora.tv</a> , where speeches of politicians, scientists, businessmen are laid out again.  Videos are divided into short chapters with tags, so that you can find in the search that on a particular topic who once could say.  But again, there is no social component, users only watch, but do not generate content. <br>  So I think and hope that bigthink.com has a bright future and a good development.  And I realized from the comments on tech crunch, how in America the intellectual niche is small and why investors were so skeptical about this project. <br>  A funny coincidence that almost simultaneously opened top4top.ru and bigthink.com, both of which positioned themselves as a site for intellectuals.  What has happened from top4top has already been seen, now I advise everyone to see what ‚Äústupid Americans‚Äù can do on <a href="http://www.bigthink.com/">www.bigthink.com</a> In general, it‚Äôs a pity that in the USA even with a small starting money (the first investor gave the creator a few tens of thousands of dollars) make a quality project.  And in Russia, the website of the Ministry of Education for half a million and the Dibrovsky portal for 15 million are well known. <br>  I have plans for distant projects, when there will be free financial opportunities, I added the creation of a similar site for Russia.  If someone is seriously going to create this with us - call :) <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/olpictures/c39/1f1/699/c391f16998f7d28e0065d3702a295b74.jpg" width="400" height="365" hspace="10" vspace="10"><habracut></habracut></div>
