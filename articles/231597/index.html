At that time, we released an updated version of our service and were very pleased with the feedback and constructive criticism we received after the first publication of an article about <a href="http://trackduck.com/">TrackDuck</a> .  We did not specifically make marketing announcements too often, but now I would like to write about all the major improvements right away.  I want to warn those who are not interested in the product in advance - do not read further :) <br><br><h4>  Integration </h4><br>  Initially, we decided to lay down the principle of each integration that truly complete integration should fit into the existing development process as easily as possible, take place with minimal time delays and work in two directions - export and import of data. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a>

    <h5>  Basecamp </h5><br>  From the very beginning of working with user reviews, it became clear that most of all people lack the ability to integrate the tool into the processes already used by the company.  We received many requests from users with suggestions to make more integrations with existing project management systems.  As a result, one of the first was decided to do the integration with Basecamp.  We really like 37signals and its products, and besides, we received the most requests for integration with this system. <br><img align="right" src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/08c/18f/13f/08c18f13ffd049679d64724ef96972f7.jpg"><br>  By connecting TrackDuck to <a href="https://basecamp.com/extras">Basecamp, the</a> system allows you to export existing users, send task descriptions and screenshots created in <a href="https://trackduck.com/en/content/integrations/basecamp/">TrackDuck</a> to Basecamp.  We were also able to implement two-way integration - now changing the status of the task or adding a new comment in one of the systems will certainly be updated in the second one! <br><br><h5>  Jira </h5><br>  Integration with this system took away from our development team most of the time, but some Jira users have already appreciated the possibilities provided by integration with the visual commenting system.  It allows you to create new tickets in the system in one click directly from the developed site.  As in the case of Basecamp, the system is able to synchronize tasks, their status and comments to them.  A screenshot of the site made using our system is attached to each task, and you can always see the problem through the eyes of the user commenting on it.  Now we are preparing for publication <a href="https://trackduck.com/en/content/integrations/jira/">plugins for jira</a> that will help you to connect TrackDuck in one click. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/dbb/da2/688/dbbda26887f51ae5d9808a8427fc1f05.jpg"></div><br><br><h5>  Wordpress </h5><br>  We also prepared and published extensions for several content management systems.  Now you can install TrackDuck on the most popular CMS in the world in 2 clicks: just make a search request in the installer of the extensions using the word trackduck or <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/trackduck/">install the extension from here</a> <br><br><h5>  Modx </h5><br>  Our extension is ready and available for installation for another great content management system and framework.  It can be installed for free <a href="http://modx.com/extras/package/trackduckvisualfeedbackformodxsites">from the official repository</a> . <br><br><h5>  Drupal </h5><br>  Now the extension <a href="https://www.drupal.org/node/2261859">is in the process of publication</a> , which for reasons beyond our control will take some more time (we will be very grateful for the advice on how to speed up this process). <br><br><h4>  Extended Browser Support </h4><br>  After the release of extensions for <a href="http://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/trackduck/ekhfapehhkdanmgjkgagafnilhomfkek">Google Chrome</a> , <a href="https://trackduck.com/en/content/extensions/firefox-extension/">Mozilla Firefox</a> , <a href="http://extensions.apple.com/details/%3Fid%3Dcom.trackduck.safari-9RN9CH67GY">Apple Safari</a> and the bookmarklet, which allows you to work with the system in IE and Opera (in the latter case, you can also use the Chrome extension installed <a href="https://addons.opera.com/en/extensions/details/download-chrome-extension-9/%3Fdisplay%3Den">with this tool</a> ) We are also ready to provide solutions for everyone our clients who are not ready to install code on the site and working with projects in their local environment. <br><br><h4>  Support for downloading images in different formats </h4><br>  Now designers from your team do not need to convert images from their usual formats, we added support for Jpg, Psd, Png, Gif, Tiff, Pdf, Ai, etc. <br><br><h4>  Image Versions </h4><br>  As before, you can upload an image and get comments on any part of it.  Now you can also prepare a corrected version of the image and not just upload it, but update the existing file, adding a new version to it, thus preserving the history of edits and progress made in the work. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/d8f/1a2/8b9/d8f1a28b96a24d56d67d58897eb1590f.jpg"></div><br><br><h4>  Tour of the system and new onboarding for users </h4><br>  About how we developed this part of the system and why it had to be done before launch, <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/trackduck/blog/229259/">I already wrote in this article</a> .  Do not repeat our mistakes, make the system understandable to all users from the very beginning! <br><br><h4>  Our promo video </h4><br>  Wonderful guys from the Vilnius studio meinart developed for us an excellent explanatory video that will help better understand non-technical experts, for which we need TrackDuck. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/dZREfVaIkl8%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700022,15700186,15700190,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhhVmpCYiZpY6MIFsp1TbMqN9gGbQA" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br><h4>  Transfer your data to TrackDuck for built-in snippet </h4><br>  You can specify in our js snippet user data that we can receive and store in your system.  This will be useful in order not to force your visitors to enter email for feedback in the anonymous feedback field every time. <br><br><h4>  Enterprise version of the system </h4><br>  As it turned out in the process of work, several teams that tried TrackDuck and found it very useful in their work, as a result, could not use the system due to strict corporate restrictions that prevented them from using cloud services.  We really didn‚Äôt want to say goodbye to these clients and therefore we decided to make a separate hosted version of our application, which could be easily integrated into the infrastructure of the enterprise so that it worked independently and provided the necessary level of privacy.  I can say that for us it was a very useful experience from finding consultants to the final implementation of the product.  If you use node.js and you need to create a similar solution for your clients - feel free to ask questions in the comments or HP, we will be happy to help you. <br><br><h4>  JavaScript client api (very soon) </h4><br>  You can make your own decision based on our physical feedback technology.  Now we are ready to provide for this a special toolkit that will allow you to connect the TrackDuck online commenting system to your solution in a couple of lines of code.  So, if you are developing, for example, a new photo hosting site or portfolio service and want to give users the opportunity to comment on images or html content right where they see it, or you are creating a new super cool service for creating prototypes or discussing documents, then <a href="">we will be very happy to help</a> save you development resources and provide early access to js api and help with installation and configuration for free. <br><br><h4>  Record video from the screen </h4><br>  We realized that just a screenshot is not always enough to understand exactly what went wrong.  For example, when we tested the system on target users, we used a mobile phone camera to record the user's reaction to the interface and its actions in the system.  Although we know about applications such as silverback or webvizor, both of these solutions are not suitable for full testing. <br><img align="right" src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/0d7/772/e5d/0d7772e5dc12e706f2692555cd4d11fc.gif"><br>  After interviewing customers and acquaintances, we decided that an application or service with which you could get a recorded session of your user or visitor would be in demand.  But working with video is more difficult than capturing screenshots, so now we launched our solution as an additional tool within our system, which allows us to record the user's screen for a short period of time (30 seconds) and convert it to gif.  This, of course, is not very long, but it already allows you to more clearly report errors and problems in the animation and behavior of interactive elements on the page.  In addition, we will soon release a version without recording time limits. <br><br>  Read more about this in Russian <a href="https://medium.com/trackduck-blog/a997c7b6b531">in my article on medium.</a> <br><br>  As always, it is important for us to know your opinion about the new features of the system that we are going to implement.  At the moment we are working or are going to start work in the following areas and we will be very grateful for the help in their prioritization.  Thanks for the comments and feedback!
