Designers from Fischer decided to follow this motto, releasing 3 pairs of new, high-quality, comfortable, but quite old in appearance and headphone designs.  So say, old school.  By the way, one of the models is called Oldskool '70 <br><br>  But, I will start in order and tell you about all the headphones in this series. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  To begin with, I will say that I received them here in such a bag with the logo of the company.

    <img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/cad/0bf/f65/cad0bff6597385fa1af9d0a84b63302d.jpg"><br><br>  This is all that united them, but from that moment on each pair separately. <br><br><h1>  Lambda </h1><br><br><img src="http://img140.imageshack.us/img140/8416/037ou.jpg"><br><br>  They are delivered in such a box, which looks like old boxes from under the strings for the guitar.  Even the cardboard is the same matte and rough. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/42e/a91/ab9/42ea91ab9d1240d977fdff2b719fe2e3.jpg"><br><br>  And in order to see the headphones, it is not even necessary to open such beauty, simply turn the box over and here they are in all its glory. <br><br><img src="http://img709.imageshack.us/img709/4513/p4251388.jpg"><br><br>  In the box in addition to headphones there are removable ear cushions and instructions for use. <br>  According to a long-standing tradition, after the description of the insides of the box, technical specifications follow.  So let us honor the traditions! <br>  Technical Specifications: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/8bc/a93/01b/8bca9301b4b2f5baa7465e9de1f285e0.png"><br><br>  Headphones on design make a good impression, quite unusual.  They are made of two wires of white and black, tightly intertwined.  At first, I thought that it was very ill-conceived, because they would unwind, but then, trying to unwind them, I saw that it would not work, because  two wires are glued together. <br><br>  The place of the bifurcation of the wire to the headphones is a bit massive, but it certainly will not break.  Plus, there is a ‚Äúunifier‚Äù that will allow you to regulate the place of the split.  Well, you understand me. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/df8/ace/e31/df8acee314894dc9de7bd2a4c7e6b002.jpg"><br><br>  3.5mm jack straight, without any quirks.  The bend of the wire is not too provided, but you can bend it by 30-45 degrees, more, I think, it is dangerous for the wire. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/030/30f/9cc/03030f9ccc16e7271784ffffd9eb7ecf.jpg"><br><br>  About the same "plugs".  They have a very convenient shape, at least for my ears.  Rubber ear cushions are quite soft and lie well in the ear.  The headphones themselves are also black and white in color, so, for fans of zebras, these headphones are just right. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/bac/573/b98/bac573b984b38551f89a7c85f1e2aeb9.jpg"><br><br>  By the way, as I already said, there are 3 pairs of interchangeable ear cushions in the kit, which will make listening to music comfortable for any ear. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/d7c/033/25c/d7c03325c4fd10f685c55ea41c46293f.jpg"><br><br>  The sound in these headphones is a little mechanical with a bounce at low frequencies, some high ones are swallowed, at medium levels the sound is smooth and soft, pleasing to the ear.  At the maximum volume can be heard in the subway, but other sounds are also heard, so full sound insulation does not occur.  But in a normal city, using medium and small ambyushur, it is enough to achieve 90% of sound insulation. <br><br>  As for the price, it is in the region of 600 rubles.  Just right for headphones of this size and class. <br><br><h4>  pros </h4><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/605/684/b03/605684b03744880889a86bc2023d43b2.png">  Sound quality <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/605/684/b03/605684b03744880889a86bc2023d43b2.png">  Removable ear cushions <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/605/684/b03/605684b03744880889a86bc2023d43b2.png">  Wire Split Adjustment <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/605/684/b03/605684b03744880889a86bc2023d43b2.png">  Comfortable fit in the ear <br><br><h4>  Minuses </h4><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/bb1/41a/892/bb141a892a966a53ae6c2002b54b39cd.png">  Double wire <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/bb1/41a/892/bb141a892a966a53ae6c2002b54b39cd.png">  Do not bend the wire at the jack <br><br><h4>  Overall rating </h4><br>  4 points out of 5 possible.  Good headphones, but with insignificant minuses. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/8f8/3f2/bc6/8f83f2bc6fa390f62c295abf3422bdd6.jpg"><br><br>  Well, let's move on to the next pair. <br><br><h1>  Cepheus </h1><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/d32/313/a3d/d32313a3d6f9041e161ae82782c5b348.jpg"><br><br>  Unlike previous ones, these headphones are presented in ordinary plastic packaging, but this does not reduce their quality and design. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/c2d/e05/baa/c2de05baa9c980aafe123a32c50c38d3.jpg"><br><br>  And immediately specifications: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/210/142/d80/210142d80cbb3ac380653fa3526b8dfa.png"><br><br>  Headphones are made of black and red (the color of an old piano) plastic, shiny metal, leather and foam rubber. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/ed8/a51/a30/ed8a51a30dcdf563967f020368144a16.jpg"><br><br>  At first glance it seems that the headphones can be rotated in any direction.  And indeed it is.  They even bend inward due to a special mechanism, and because of this they become practically collapsible and take up little space. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/1f3/7d3/3c7/1f37d33c7bdcc0ce228bf58a9c6b756d.jpg"><br><br>  Calling these headphones open does not turn the language, nor does it close.  This is something average.  It seems that the leather bezel is also inside the speaker, and it seems to be so small that it doesn‚Äôt clasp the ear and the sound is heard outside.  I will call them half-closed. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/803/968/182/80396818255c2d9b39ace43d9335a5c1.jpg"><br><br>  Jack is slightly bent, which allows him to bend more.  This is useful if you are an active person and the player is in your pocket (as a rule, when you squat, it is the wire that bends). <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/394/6c4/30a/3946c430aef6582cee089206db9caa26.jpg"><br><br>  The wire is strong enough and high quality.  iPod Classic is quietly hanging on it.  It connects to the left speaker, as in all modern headphones of this class. <br>  Adjusting the size allows you to adjust the headphones on the head and make listening more comfortable and individual. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/0a1/25c/0c0/0a125c0c0f0593fc97cc872cf2a4a289.jpg"><br><br>  During the use of special inconvenience was observed.  The sound is clear, the sound insulation is excellent (outside the 2.1 system was playing), they sit comfortably, except for some pressure on the head after 2 hours of continuous wear.  Low frequencies are rather well heard, although some disappear, the high frequencies pass completely, even sometimes it becomes unpleasant (in special tracks).  In the subway can not hear other sounds, the sound at the maximum stun. <br><br>  The price for Cepheus is about 800r.  This, in my opinion, for the half-closed headphones of this quality is very good. <br><br><h4>  pros </h4><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/605/684/b03/605684b03744880889a86bc2023d43b2.png">  High-quality sound + sound insulation <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/605/684/b03/605684b03744880889a86bc2023d43b2.png">  Reliable wire + connection to one speaker <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/605/684/b03/605684b03744880889a86bc2023d43b2.png">  Compactness <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/605/684/b03/605684b03744880889a86bc2023d43b2.png">  Design <br><br><h4>  Minuses </h4><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/bb1/41a/892/bb141a892a966a53ae6c2002b54b39cd.png">  A bit of pressure after long wearing <br><br><h4>  Overall rating </h4><br>  4 ++ out of 5 possible.  Upscale "ears", with a small minus in the form of pressure. <br><br>  And finally, the legend: <br><br><h1>  Oldskool '70 </h1><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/eef/f44/b7c/eeff44b7c960d147e01eaac3938f3f39.jpg"><br><br>  These headphones complete the parade of heroes from Fischer Audio.  And this is understandable why: metal + plastic gives an incredible quality to the headphones, comfortable, beautiful, in general, see for yourself. <br><br>  Let's start with the box.  She was gently wrapped in white translucent paper. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/e11/7b2/c01/e117b2c0165ed0025dbb7f9ecc35842a.jpg"><br><br>  Ruthlessly tearing up the papers we see: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/7f2/878/c91/7f2878c9196578c74dbf3d8dc5851651.jpg"><br><br>  Matryoshka some: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/bf1/028/537/bf10285372d0169b89a4ddd6afe6073a.jpg"><br><br>  Open and finally: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/732/1e8/567/7321e8567661e878a928892500adc5e3.jpg"><br><br>  Under the headphones there was an instruction and a case: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/e5a/d82/a52/e5ad82a52b8aa4bdb6c4e78a10d60f4b.jpg"><br><br>  Fuh, with the box over.  We turn to those.  Specifications: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/ad7/7ac/004/ad77ac0042dc518dce8bbf43105c363a.png"><br><br>  So, we have high-quality headphones Fischer Audio Oldskool '70.  Metal and plastic in one person.  And of course, pleases the presence of the cover in the box. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/918/7b5/afc/9187b5afcc55abdfd1a71977f33cd743.jpg"><br><br>  There is nothing to say about them, everything can be seen in the photo.  They are nice to even hold in their hands, not what to listen to! <br>  Open headphones, do not press, very comfortable to sit.  The sound is excellent, the bass is clear, the high frequencies are heard well. <br>  On the ears they sit gently, thanks to the foam, on which the name of the company is engraved <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/9e5/9f9/2db/9e59f92db8eec1b6aa6f3c480ee4bc7f.jpg"><br><br>  A small drawback - 2 wires are connected to two speakers (but this is old school. It always has been before).  I feel a little uncomfortable with wearing headphones on my head. <br>  The wire itself is durable and flat.  The place of transition from one to two is made soundly, so I think there will be no problems with it. <br><br><img src="http://img709.imageshack.us/img709/5595/016rd.jpg"><br><br>  Jack is straight.  Flat wire bends well, breaks in this place should not be. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/283/889/4db/2838894db0fb7358d2dcc44d337ecbf7.jpg"><br><br>  Adjust headphones in size better before you put them on your head.  The mechanism itself is beautiful and convenient, it allows you to clearly fix the size. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/13e/da9/92a/13eda992a1d4eac5f5536029e0ee1679.jpg"><br><br>  Headphones are well bent in different directions (not like Cepheus, of course, but you can calibrate for yourself) <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/bd3/e4d/20e/bd3e4d20e4d5e8acfebef54ea319b6e6.jpg"><br><br>  A good fit and fit to the ears allows you to get a clear sound balance, the sound varies in such a range of frequencies that you hear excellent sound in the middle frequencies, and at low and high good, although I do not argue, reproduction at high and bass periodically skips. <br>  By sound - this is the best headphones from the presented.  By volume also, external sound isolates up to 70-80%. <br><br>  Price about 1900r.  Excellent headphones with high-end design and sound quality, the price is fair. <br><br><h4>  pros </h4><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/605/684/b03/605684b03744880889a86bc2023d43b2.png">  Sound quality <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/605/684/b03/605684b03744880889a86bc2023d43b2.png">  Soft headphones <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/605/684/b03/605684b03744880889a86bc2023d43b2.png">  Comfortable fit <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/605/684/b03/605684b03744880889a86bc2023d43b2.png">  Calibration "for yourself" <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/605/684/b03/605684b03744880889a86bc2023d43b2.png">  Design <br><br><h4>  Minuses </h4><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/bb1/41a/892/bb141a892a966a53ae6c2002b54b39cd.png">  Connect to two speakers. <br><br><h4>  Overall rating </h4><br>  5 out of 5 possible.  Headphones worthy of praise.  Virtually no flaws. <br><br>  In my opinion, Fischer Audio provided competitively capable animals that are still competing for their place in the market. <br>  All of these headphones look decent against the background of their rivals.  I hope in the future the products of this growing company will only improve! </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/92516/">https://habr.com/ru/post/92516/</a></p>
