Personally, I remember the day when a small gadget with an ancient LCD display came into my hands.  As a schoolboy, I took him for a calculator, and only some time later I came to the conclusion that the device had more serious goals.  Indirectly, this was spoken by his buttons with a Russian and English layout, reminiscent of a computer keyboard. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  The event described above happened in 1998, and already then some parents of the students who studied with me began to talk about the modernization of the school curriculum.  In particular, it was at their request that the school made a computer class and began to teach the basics of working with a PC.  However, he did not become an ordinary thing for any class until the very end of my studies (2002).  And to us, the guys chasing the ball on the school playground, it seemed like a thing from the world of adults, business people.  Those who wear formal suits and hold black cases in their hands. <br><br>  Then my father‚Äôs acquaintance bought an electronic typewriter, and later we found a laptop in his office.  But no one was going to introduce us directly to these devices.  However, the time of digital technology smoothly entered the life of the younger generation to radio engineering circles (where one could even play old, using a tape recorder as a reader, computers), computer clubs (2000s of the year) and the first mobile phones.  It was there, as I now understand, that there was a real distinction between the familiar world of well-known things and the state of the postmodern dictating new, unknown to anyone rules of the game for which nobody was preparing us.  Not out of malice, but because of the fact that everyone, both adults and children, were put in the face of a new dimension. <br><br>  Was the Internet a habitual thing for us?  Of course not.  First of all, it became a serious test for adults who saw in him a serious threat to academic performance and the occupation of ‚Äúreal deeds‚Äù.  I even remember a teacher who argued with the mother of one of the students, upholding the priority of handwritten writing over typing skills on the keyboard.  And, on the contrary, the advanced ‚ÄúUncle Boria‚Äù, who in the radio engineering circle taught adolescents speed printing, conducting a test lesson every week using a special program (you know, probably, where you need to ‚Äúcatch‚Äù the letters falling on the screen).

      Many felt how time began to accelerate its course.  Information has become more, there are more factors that distract attention from the usual goals (go to college or university, and then go to work in the specialty), set once adults.  The functions of education were partially transferred to the Internet (then Dial-Up): the first and real economic task became actual - it was necessary to buy cards with per-minute billing (~ 2002-2004).  The Internet took time, became an obstacle to socialization, and even caused aggression on the part of companies accustomed to spending time on the street.  But it was the emergence of the Internet in the life of adolescents that stimulated the development of independent learning skills and, as it turned out, increased their chances for further education outside the school (by 2006, many were already actively using the Network as a preparation for entrance examinations to the university). <br><br>  The fact is that it is impossible to take away natural curiosity from a person, and in children it is almost instinctive.  And no restrictions will help protect the child from experiments, which, in turn, provide precious personal experience.  As our parents did not worry, but our generation did not become Internet addicted.  On the contrary, it learned in practice the internal struggle with laziness and the possibility of self-organization, gained a desire to learn new things and eventually began to create useful things for society (either software or hand made).  What is the world boom of startups!  And all this is done by people who embody their own ideas, trying to make this world a better place.  But the most important thing is that their incentive is an idea, and not a desire for personal enrichment (here I would like to draw attention to already successful companies of the world scale, who began their work by investing personal funds in projects that did not guarantee success in the future).  And it is the implementation of ideas (ie, the impossible) that has become the driving force of modern business today. <br><br>  The pioneering generation, which survived twenty years later under the onslaught of the information tsunami of the 2000s, brought real fruits of will and personal stubbornness;  the fruits of efforts, who as children, ventured to oppose themselves to the world of adults and enter the unknown world of open borders.  Today I think that this is only the beginning and we still have to go through a real transformation of the usual business models that will unwittingly produce new cultural trends that radically change the view of the future.  Our generation only creates a foundation for future discoveries, defending the right to create "in spite of".  A generation that chose the path of creation for the benefit of society, instinctively striving to learn the new. <br><br>  In the key of these reflections, I want to emphasize the high importance of the modern IT sector, which really looks at things that really matter for the development and creation of the future;  Business, creating a new model against the desire to extract only one profit;  and the courage of the new generation, which is taking a step abroad in the comfort zone, often abandoning the usual educational models and social guarantees, in favor of self-education and a career from scratch;  in favor of activities that really matter in the postmodern environment, both from an economic and cultural point of view for the development of our society in the key of world trends. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/300006/">https://habr.com/ru/post/300006/</a></p>
