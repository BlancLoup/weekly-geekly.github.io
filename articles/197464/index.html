Was held in Moscow.  The event took place on October 1 at the Radisson Royal ("Ukraine"). <br><br>  The creative concept of the event - ‚ÄúDEPO: Efficiency in our genes!‚Äù - well revealed the advantages of working with DEPO Computers.  We know what the Russian customer wants from IT, we always study in detail the needs of his business, and this allows us to achieve maximum efficiency in each project. <br><br>  In accordance with this concept, experts from DEPO Computers and representatives of vendors from Cisco, Intel, HGST, Microsoft, NetApp and Raidix talked about the best scenarios for the development of IT infrastructures, the latest technologies and unique solutions.

Imagine the situation: you are a user of DEPO cloud services and within 6 months you realized that these services do not completely solve the tasks set, and you want to complete the use of them.  The company spent the money spent for all this time in a discount at purchase of the equipment DEPO! <br><br><br clear="all"><br clear="all">  Together with Roman Nalepov, Greg Kwolek, Senior Director, Worldwide Cloud Sales Development HGST, a Western Digital company.  He, on the example of current trends, confirmed the correctness of the DEPO approach in the development of cloud services and provided interesting forecasts.  For example, that one of the foundations of developing future HDD manufacturing technologies is sealing. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/f82/d92/d54/f82d92d54825071559f03073accdd1b8.jpg"><br><br>  In a joint <a href="http://depo.ru/download/ForumMaterials/%25D0%25A1%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BA%25D1%2586%25D0%25B8%25D1%258F%25201-3%2520%25D0%25A1%25D0%25B8%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B5%25D1%2580%25D0%25B3%25D0%25B8%25D1%258F%2520%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B1%25D0%25BB%25D0%25B0%25D1%2587%25D0%25BD%25D1%258B%25D1%2585%2520%25D1%2580%25D0%25B5%25D1%2588%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B9%2520DEPO%2520Microsoft%25201C.pdf">presentation by</a> Artur Pyarn from DEPO Computers and Vlad Dmitriev from Microsoft, the expansion of cooperation between companies in the field of cloud services was announced.

As part of it, representatives of DEPO Computers, three vendors and a client spoke. <br><br>  The section was chaired by Dmitry Bessonov, system architect at DEPO Computers. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/e7f/ab9/a66/e7fab9a6677e379d519b0503913707d5.jpg"><br><br>  Sergei Lysokobylka from Intel introduced the fourth-generation Haswell processors. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/0b2/26d/8d3/0b226d8d36efab04e08da4914d260e67.jpg"><br><br>  Alex Nicholson, Business Development Manager - NetApp EMEA E-Series Sales &amp; Product Specialist.  A top manager from the global office told about a strategic partnership with DEPO Computers. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/c90/3ee/008/c903ee0081769637891f46e32b09763d.jpg"><br><br>  Sergey Razumovsky, Executive Director, RAIDIX. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/f29/86e/b7e/f2986eb7e66fe8c11e1374bb960a1dac.jpg"><br><br>  Artex CIO (official dealer of Land Rover and Jaguar cars) Denis Shimansky vividly confirmed the benefits of working with DEPO computers.  In particular, the comprehensive modernization of the IT infrastructure, carried out by our specialists, allows Artex to display new unique services.  For example, "THEN an hour."  Everyone knows that car dealers have any MOT at least 3-4 hours, or even a whole day. <br><br>  In the next issue of the IT manager magazine will be a detailed article about this project.  The journalist interviewed Denis immediately after his speech. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/71a/602/bcc/71a602bcc4bac923bf70b63451b74113.jpg"><br><br>  <a href="http://depo.ru/download/ForumMaterials/%25D0%25A1%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BA%25D1%2586%25D0%25B8%25D1%258F%25203%2520%25D0%2598%25D0%25BD%25D1%2584%25D0%25BE%25D1%2580%25D0%25BC%25D0%25B0%25D1%2586%25D0%25B8%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BD%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B0%25D1%258F%2520%25D0%2591%25D0%25B5%25D0%25B7%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BF%25D0%25B0%25D1%2581%25D0%25BD%25D0%25BE%25D1%2581%25D1%2582%25D1%258C.pdf">The section "Information Security"</a> , despite the fact that it was at the very end of the forum, gathered a very large audience and was one of the most interesting. <br><br>  Oleg Gurin, Head of Information Security, DEPO Computers, spoke about changes in legislation in the field of personal data protection.  Then, using the example of a project implemented for an international company from the Soci√©t√© G√©n√©rale group, showed how to achieve full compliance with the Russian requirements for protecting personal data and not violating the integrity of the company's global standards. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/9f1/521/720/9f15217206b026fc7956e6f172da6167.jpg"><br><br>  Andrei Kharitonov, Cisco Business Development Manager, during his speech, constantly moved around the room, managing content on the screen either from a tablet or from a laptop, while online demonstrating the work of various services.  As you probably guessed, he talked about BYOD technologies. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/415/cf0/627/415cf062770ef8a79c8b0632d36b6dd4.jpg"><br><br>  Sessions of questions and answers were after each thematic section, but the most vivid questions and answers were heard after the section on information security.  Who knows what topics in the discussion the participants would have come to if the time of the reception had not come.  In the end, such words as ‚Äúsnowden‚Äù and ‚Äúbig brother‚Äù sounded. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/25e/16c/fc7/25e16cfc7d3fa21e7756728ee57f4bee.jpg"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/aba/a96/099/abaa96099ec3bd594bd906cb2b3420df.jpg"><br><br>  The exhibition at the 9th forum has become even larger compared to the previous ones and increased to 5 thematic sections: IT infrastructure, data center engineering systems, information security, cloud services and BYOD technologies.  Everything, without exception, could be tested. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/b41/b02/ff2/b41b02ff266e0182ebf436a56a764a12.jpg"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/704/3bc/268/7043bc268d2c1ef58722119373ff6099.jpg"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/e2a/026/929/e2a02692932614b1a8045df952029376.jpg"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/b5f/25f/c54/b5f25fc54ff20a08d2fad5e580040e81.jpg"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/8fa/2e1/acd/8fa2e1acd89f95085916820bd0b111ed.jpg"><br><br>  At the end of the event there was a traditional prize drawing among the forum participants.  One of the prizes was a certificate for courses of extreme driving sports bike. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/f19/b95/b65/f19b95b65edbb901342a72e2eaf8330b.jpg"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/816/7ad/e08/8167ade08f354704077fd74da85c902d.jpg"><br><br>  We thank the guests of the IX Forum DEPO Computers for IT directors "DEPO: Efficiency in our genes!".
