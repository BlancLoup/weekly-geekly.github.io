  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Blogs intercept initiative</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  The speed of publishing news on blogs should make many traditional media think about their prospects.  It is important to note that information about the sensational transaction between <a href="http://www.google.com/">Google</a> and <a href="http://youtube.com/">YouTube</a> , about which only the lazy one did not write, first appeared not in the Washngton Post or in the New York Times, but in the Techcrunch blog, specializing in covering the events in the growing world called the Web 2.0. <br><br>  The appearance of this sensational information in the blog makes you once again think about the question of how leading the media are operative in the information sphere.  Blogs are becoming more interesting, seize the initiative from the media.  It is bloggers that are increasingly becoming suppliers of important information, sometimes replacing journalists, who, by the way, are increasingly using information from online diaries.  The ability to instantly write a few lines and report the news to the world, quickly respond to new information from offline sources, put links to other articles in the text - all this is much more interesting and more useful for the reader.  The trend is that the influence of bloggers in the world of information is growing every day. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a>  <a href="http://www.jupitermedia.com/">The company Jupiter Research</a> in one of the latest studies found that most Europeans get more information from the Internet than from newspapers.  On average, every European resident spends 4 hours a week reading news on the Internet, while only three are spent on newspapers and magazines.  And, for example, three years ago people spent 2 hours on the Internet.  True, the study notes that television is still the main source of information.

      In Russia, the blogosphere is also developing quite intensively.  Sooner or later, traditional media will have to adapt to it.  The phenomenon of the Russian-language politicized segment of <a href="http://wwwlivejournal.com/">LiveJournal</a> , which is inhabited by political technologists, many leading journalists and other famous people, made if not the traditional, then at least the major online media to regularly monitor LiveJournal blogs.  It is in them that information is published from a direct participant in an event, and very quickly: it is enough for him to type a few lines on a mobile PC, while a journalist needs to launch a whole ‚Äúpublication mechanism‚Äù. <br><br>  Returning to Google and YouTube, it is worth noting that this deal will only push further changes in the media field.  Resources like YouTube in the future will certainly affect it in the same way that blogs are currently influencing.  This service makes publishing video files for users just as easy and fast as blogs - publishing articles. <br><br>  It is still difficult to imagine what these trends will lead to.  At a minimum, giants like News Corp.  and NBC will be forced to adjust their development strategies.  If traditional media misses this point, then you can only expect one thing: we‚Äôll learn about this failure from TechCrunch or watch a video report on YouTube. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/4516/">https://habr.com/ru/post/4516/</a></p>
