  <section class="page js-page"><h1>AMD hell or how I was tormented with a graphics card from AMD on Linux</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Some people are lucky with computer hardware.  You take a bootable USB flash drive, install Linux, everything works out of the box and you don‚Äôt know the problems.  But it also happens that in order for a module to work, you have to dance. <br>  On one of these dances and will be this post. <br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/f6a/7c7/9de/f6a7c79de7fabc47d09a72e9b288d360.gif" alt="image"></div><br>  Previously, working on Linux, I did not know any problems.  It so happened that I had to transfer to another computer for a while.  As expected, I installed Linux.  I took it with me, so almost immediately the problem was discovered: the laptop does not come out of sleep and from hibernation.  Just a black screen and that's it.  Even the backlight does not turn on. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Google suggested that you can install proprietary drivers on a video card, which I did.  From sleep, the laptop began to go through again.  Sometimes a black screen, and sometimes everything is almost ok.  Some artifacts appeared and the icons did not appear, empty fields instead of time, and so on.  Well, okay, even so.  Just in case, I save and close all the documents before going to bed, so as not to hurt anything, if normal wake up does not work. <br><br>  It would seem that for the bloated problem?  Well, do not wake up ... then do a hard reset (hold the power button) and reload the OS.  And that's what.  I watch video courses on an external monitor.  And before that I had no problems.  More precisely, I decided them.  Initially, the output video worked only if you load the OS with a video cable connected.  If the cable is connected after the download, then on the external monitor it is impossible to make a native resolution for it.  Watching with non-native is impossible.  Restart the OS again?  Hello Windows! <br><br>  And I solved this problem by choosing another distribution.  I tried some, stopped at linux mint.  It seems to have earned the output to the external screen.  Now you can connect the cable whenever you want.  You come from work, you get a laptop and you connect it to the big screen. <br>  Oh yeah, sleep is not working yet.  You need to install proprietary drivers, as I did on ubunt.  Put.  I come home with a sleeping beech, I connect - again it does not work.  And it dawned on me!  The problem was not in ubuntu, but in the driver for the video card.

      So it turns out that a <b>free driver does not know how to wake up a laptop, and a proprietary one does not know how to output to an external monitor</b> .  So sit and choose what is more important to you.  It is more important to me and that and that.  I can not give up on something.  I'd rather give up AMD video cards. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/410/985/c79/410985c7975384d4c890867746aa7a29.png" alt="image"></div><br>  This is the question of what repels many from Linux.  Okay, I bought a new laptop without amd's card, and I left this one as a hospital.  Do people need these problems if they are not lucky enough to have a card of this company on board?  How can I offer them Linux if I don‚Äôt know how to solve this problem?  And it's easier for them to leave the Windows and not know the problems with this.  I advised the girl to buy a laptop.  Then I did not know about such subtleties with their cards.  Put her ubuntu.  And there is the inscription AMD unsupported hardware and all the accompanying problems.  In the end - minus one linuxoid.  Thank you guys from Advanced Micro Devices. <br><br>  I hope this post will help you in choosing the right hardware for your laptop. <br><br>  The model of that laptop: HP pavilion g6 1211er. <br>  Video Card: ATI Radeon HD 6520G <br><br>  The comments <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/201666/">suggest</a> that for Linux you can not take wifi-cards from broadcom </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/201666/">https://habr.com/ru/post/201666/</a></p>
