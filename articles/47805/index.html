It has long been in a closed state, but is now available to subscribers of the Survival blog.  And now the final article in my series. <br><br>  <i>Survival is an activity in difficult and dangerous conditions, when inaction or incorrect behavior can lead to death.</i> <br><br>  For many of us, the word "Survival" is associated with some abstract difficulties and hardships.  In the process of training for survival training, when we can plan a situation, there are often disputes about what is honest and what is not fair.  We would have those or other resources in a real situation.  What to take, and what not to take.  All this happens because the workout does not have a clear model.  There is no clear picture of the situation, available resources, conditions and dangers.  Someone thinks about life after a plane crash, others are preparing for a nuclear winter, and others - make a fire.  Often you have to see arguments that seem to be combined into one situation, but not really existing simultaneously in life.  The purpose of this article is to try to systematize possible hypothetical situations and describe how to proceed, based on the circumstances of the available resources and what bonuses can be expected.  In other words - we will try to build different models that do not contradict possible situations. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  <b>Robinson</b> <br>  It is given: a desert island, hot tropics, a wrecked ship drowned, of the things - only clothes, there‚Äôs no help waiting. <br>  First of all, you should find a water source.  This is not necessarily pure fresh water, the source may be, for example, some juicy fruits, seaweed, meat and animal blood.  Moreover, in extreme cases, you can drink seawater for some time.  It does not quench thirst, but will not allow the body to dehydrate too quickly.  However, after 10-11 days, irreversible fatal changes will occur in the kidneys.  Simultaneously with the search for water, you should take care of protection from wild animals: take some stick and look at places in the trees for the night.  At first, while you do not know the fauna of the area - it is better to spend the night in a tree, but with the guarantee that you do not fall down in a dream.  When you find water, start looking for food.  You might find it all at once. <br>  The bonuses of this model: when you find a stable source of water and food - you are unlimited in time to acquire everything else: fire, housing, tools of work, and time is a valuable resource.

      <b>Grief tourist</b> <br>  It is given: you got rid of a group of tourists, in general, lost in the mountains.  Of things - a backpack with personal equipment, maps and a compass - no.  Coldly. <br>  If you are sure that you remember the way to here, return to the section of the path where you last saw your group.  The surest behavior in this situation is to wait.  The priority is to preserve heat.  With water, as a rule, in the mountains there are no problems.  Bonfire and dwelling have approximately equal priority.  If there is no wind and precipitation, it is better to make a fire first, if the weather is harsh, then we first find shelter.  Then you should take care to find you.  Find an open glade nearby.  Burn at night - big and bright bonfires, in the afternoon - smoke.  Leave around the district as much as possible traces of your presence, lay out on the ground arrows of stones or branches, indicating the path to your shelter, tie ropes to trees, crack branches.  It should be noted that if you are high, where there is only snow, then you need to try to go down to the level of the forest. <br>  Bonuses of this model: you have quite a lot of all sorts of useful things.  Warm clothes, a sleeping bag, something from common gear ‚Äî for example, a saw, food, or even a tent.  Most likely you have matches.  Knife! <br><br>  <b>Catastrophe</b> <br>  Given: You survived a traffic accident (plane, train, bus, car) in a remote place.  Help will not be soon. <br>  If there are many people, you should find any available containers and send a few people to search for water.  The rest will be engaged in the wounded.  Here, again, the most relevant thing is to wait.  You will make a residence out of the wreckage of transport, or even be able to live right in it.  Fire, too, do not make a problem, someone must find a lighter or matches.  Well, if the transport caught fire, then take care of maintaining fire for their own needs. <br>  The bonuses of this model: The more transport - the louder it falls, the greater will be your home (unless of course the transport has burned down at all).  People in luggage have a lot of all sorts of useful things.  In the transport itself is also a lot of useful stuff.  Most likely, there is some food. <br><br>  These were models in which survival comes unexpectedly.  If you prepare yourself a shelter for survival, then you have the right to put everything there, depending on what kind of trouble you want to go through.  If you go into an environment where you can survive, then again, you can take care of your equipment. <br><br>  Now consider the more severe cases. <br><br>  <b>Extreme</b> <br>  Dano: Caught in an avalanche, left alone, without things, comrades, no one knows where.  Mountains, high, cold.  The point is not a fountain.  What to do?  Probably go down.  And if without ropes will not work? <br><br>  Or so: They crossed the ford on a mountain river, fell, all things and comrades sailed far ahead.  You are alone and you have nothing but wet clothes.  Coldly.  Wilderness <br>  Ndya.  Lousy situation.  It all depends on the strength of your body.  Without anything, it will be very difficult to make a fire.  It remains only to warm the active movement.  But the forces are limited.  After a while, you just get out.  And still need to attempt to rescue. <br><br>  Or here: we went to the mountain alone, took off the backpack, and he rolled, rolled and fell into the abyss.  And there is a map with a compass, and all that is acquired by overwork.  The path of the memory does not remember.  As always off the beaten path. <br><br>  What exactly to do in these cases - I do not know. <br><br>  Bonuses of these models: such cases are, but rarely.  And, as a rule, occur by negligence or reassessment of their strength.  When they organize a dangerous journey, they take a lot of reinsurance measures.  Register a route in the rescue service, which will start looking for you, if you do not get in touch at the appointed time.  Dangerous areas on the river are not all at once, but one by one.  With insurance.  Avalanche-prone areas bypass in a special way, or do not go at all, if you are not sure.  In general, all ways to avoid those places where it is impossible to control the situation.  And yet, it is important to control your audacity.  Extreme - this is not insane, it is a controlled danger.  To tell myself ‚ÄúI will not go there because I cannot control this danger‚Äù is a much stronger act than to say ‚ÄúI will do it anyway, no matter what.‚Äù <br><br>  Another option when you can be left with nothing is if, for example, you escaped from captivity.  Or the bandits took you far to the Gobi Desert and left you there in one pajamas. <br><br>  <b>Findings:</b> <br>  Situations in which you will remain completely without anything for a very long time either occur at your will, or because of stupidity, carelessness, or excessive audacity.  In other cases, you always have some resources.  There are practically no situations when there is no all resources at once - water, fire, food, shelter, tools and time.  And, as a rule, all resources are not immediately needed.  But I do not urge to relax.  It is necessary to learn to survive in any conditions, with any set of resources and means. <br><br>  Now that we have considered different situations, we can describe the entities that are important in the process of survival.  From which, as from cubes, it will be possible to add new models. <br><br>  <b>"Temperature"</b> <br>  Conditionally, you can select 2 options: "warm" or "cold."  Those.  if we say ‚Äúwarm‚Äù, we mean that we do not need to urgently make a fire or build a dwelling to keep warm.  If we say ‚Äúcold‚Äù, then the search for shelter or fire has a high priority. <br><br>  <b>"Weather"</b> <br>  Options are based on whether shelter is needed at the moment.  ‚ÄúGood weather‚Äù means that it is possible to operate effectively in the open air.  ‚ÄúBad‚Äù weather means that you cannot act effectively without shelter.  For example: ‚ÄúCold‚Äù, but ‚ÄúGood weather‚Äù means you can switch to making fire.  And if ‚ÄúBad weather‚Äù (there is a downpour or strong wind), then it is obvious that it will not be very correct to make a fire in the open air, and we must first hide somewhere. <br><br>  <b>"Water"</b> <br>  Well, that's understandable.  Does thirst threaten us?  Is water search a priority?  ‚ÄúWater is‚Äù means that there is no problem with water. <br><br>  <b>"Stand" or "Go"</b> <br>  These entities mean which strategy we choose.  Whether you choose yourself, or wait for help.  For example, having lost high in the mountains, it is better to descend, i.e.  "go".  And turning over on a train or crashing on a scheduled plane, it‚Äôs better not to go anywhere - that is,  "Stand". <br><br>  <b>"How long have we got"</b> <br>  This option means how much you need to hold out until the rescue: 2 days, or 2 months.  Here, the options will come from food and drink: "3 days", "3 weeks", "more than 3 weeks" and "unknown / indefinite."  If you know for sure that you will be saved in 3 days or less, then you may not even think about food and water.  For example, you know that the day to the nearest settlement is 2 days on the way.  ‚Äú3 weeks‚Äù - this means that you need to hold out for a long time, so, for example, you still need water, but without food you can live this time (especially if you ‚Äústand‚Äù).  "More than 3 weeks" - obviously, it is worth thinking about nutrition.  Especially if you "go."  If "it is not known \ indefinitely", then it is better to be safe and take into account what you need to drink and eat. <br><br>  <b>"Equipment"</b> <br>  This is an extensive term.  It means that you have at your disposal useful, assisting in the survival of things or external resources.  This does not necessarily mean that you have the tools or the gear.  Those.  equipment also depends on the amount of raw materials available.  (For example, in the forest there are trees and any vegetation, something can be eaten, something can be built and a fire made. But in Antarctica you have nothing but snow and ice) Ie  the ‚ÄúEquipment‚Äù parameter describes everything that is available to you, from ‚Äúnothing‚Äù to ‚Äúa broken airliner and all its luggage‚Äù.  Food - also refers to the equipment. <br><br>  The above are 6 conditions that are important for survival.  Now you can synthesize any new model.  You can try to unscrew everything at the most difficult.  So: It's cold, the weather is bad, there is no water, equipment is ‚Äúnothing‚Äù, you need to go and all this is indefinite.  Ideally, you need to learn to survive even in this case.  But I can hardly imagine where such a situation would have been possible.  And if it is possible - how to survive? <br><br>  PS <br>  You often hear the questions: ‚ÄúWhy are you doing this?‚Äù, ‚ÄúWhy are you interested in coaching survival?‚Äù, ‚ÄúWhy do you need it?‚Äù.  I'll try to answer.  In many of us there are disturbing thoughts that one day all that we are used to may not become.  Thoughts that we can stay without anything in harsh conditions.  We can hardly imagine when this could happen, and we believe that everything will be fine.  But somewhere in the depths of the soul there is some sort of anxiety.  This anxiety takes for itself a part of our peace, and a part of our thoughts.  We can not answer the many questions that arise "How to be if ...".  But we are learning to survive not because we are preparing for a global catastrophe.  While practicing survival, we gradually find some answers for ourselves, we become more direct, break many stereotypes, go through situations that previously caused us anxiety.  We like to discover new human abilities.  We like the feeling of being prepared for difficult conditions and the feeling of self-confidence.  For this we love survival. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/47805/">https://habr.com/ru/post/47805/</a></p>
