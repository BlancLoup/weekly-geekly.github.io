  <section class="page js-page"><h1>The Ministry of Industry and Trade will allocate subsidies for the repayment of loans to participants of the program of import substitution of electronics</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  The Ministry of Industry and Trade will support the participants of the import substitution program of the electronic industry.  The ministry intends to develop radio electronics in four areas: telecommunications equipment, computers, equipment for the production of electronic components and the intelligent control system.  The agency will provide them with subsidies for partial compensation of loans and research costs. <br><br>  To get subsidies, companies must pass a contest Minpromtorg.  Only winners will receive compensation.  Thus, the winning projects in the development of intelligent control systems will give 1 billion rubles.  Projects in the production of telecommunications equipment can receive up to 1.5 billion rubles.  Companies producing special technological equipment can claim 2 billion rubles.  Most of all will receive projects in the field of computer technology development - up to 2.5 billion. <br><br>  Borrowed funds are needed for companies to rent land and buildings, develop project documentation and create infrastructure.  Another condition for obtaining a subsidy is a long term loan.  It should exceed a year, and the date of its registration should fall in the interval from 2016 to 2025.  Those who take ruble loans are subsidized by no more than 90% of the key rate of the Central Bank, if the loan rate exceeds it.  Otherwise, the state will pay 90% of the cost of interest payments. <a name="habracut"></a>

      Enterprises with a foreign currency loan will be given a ruble subsidy (with conversion at the exchange rate on the day of payment), but the maximum payment for them will be calculated based on the rate of 7% per annum. <br><br>  Russian products are not inferior in quality to imported ones, but the governments of foreign countries encourage the export of their producers with preferential loans, compensate development and modernization costs, says Alexei Dianov, a representative of the Micron plant.  Such companies are not yet available to Russian companies, and the cost of commercial loans is much higher, he complains. <br><br>  Now high interest rates - from 15 to 20% per annum and compensation for them is very necessary, agrees with him the deputy director of the company "T-platforms" (owns 75% of the developer of microprocessors "Baikal Electronics") Elena Churakova.  According to her, subsidies for research and development are necessary, because without them, enterprises are not able to quickly launch a large number of products on the market. <br><br>  "T-platforms" plan to participate in competitions of the Ministry of Industry and Trade in personal and server computing technology.  In addition, the Moscow Center for SPARC Technologies (MCST), the Elbrus microprocessor developer, has such plans, an assistant director of marketing Konstantin Trushkin <a href="http://www.vedomosti.ru/technology/articles/2015/11/23/617874-otechestvennuyu-radioelektroniku-prostimuliruyut-nizkim-protsentom">told</a> Vedomosti. <br><br>  The Ministry of Industry and Trade proposed to send 40.5 billion rubles to support the production of computing equipment.  Extrabudgetary funding should reach 26.5 billion rubles.  According to the plan of the Ministry of Industry and Trade, the share of imports in this area by 2020 should decrease to 97.6%, and by 2025 - to 93.3%.  Considering that now the share of Russian equipment does not exceed 1%, this is a great progress, the representative of the Ministry of Industry and Trade emphasized. <br><br>  It is planned to direct 42.8 billion rubles to support domestic production of communications equipment, 28.6 billion rubles will be spent on developing the production of special technological equipment, and the production of intelligent control systems should cost the state 12.7 billion rubles. <br><br>  According to Deputy Prime Minister Rogozin, the enterprises currently being developed will reach the required level by 2018. <br><br>  On November 1, <a href="http://megamozg.ru/post/20834/">it became known</a> that the initiators of import substitution of electronics reduced the state program.  The Ministry of Industry and Trade has published a new edition of the program for the development of the electronic and electronic industry.  The new state program will cost the federal budget 173.9 billion rubles. <br><br>  Initially, this amount was to reach 175.6 billion rubles.  Planned expenses did not fall because the agency had figured out how to save.  In January, the Ministry of Industry and Trade set a task for Russian manufacturers to occupy 60% of the domestic market until 2025, but now it‚Äôs only 35%. <br><br>  In addition, the program excluded the support of radio electronics for medical products, for which it was planned to allocate 16.2 billion rubles.  Estimates of the share currently occupied by the Russian high-tech equipment on the market coincide in both options - 18‚Äì19% at the end of 2014. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/296614/">https://habr.com/ru/post/296614/</a></p>
