      Participated in 15 meetings Defcon Russia <br>  Speakers in more than 20 countries <br>  Over 30 speeches at international technical conferences <br>  Over 40 studies <br>  Nearly 100 published vulnerabilities in SAP <br>  Nearly 200 vulnerabilities published in total <br>  Bole 300 vulnerabilities detected <br><br><a name="habracut"></a><h4>  Search and detection of vulnerabilities </h4><br>  Since November 2007, the laboratory began a search and analysis of vulnerabilities in software products.  The key feature of its activity was the principle of Responsible Disclosure: we inform the developer about the discovered vulnerability, help close it, and then post the details.  Initially, the objects of analysis were simple web applications and CMS-systems, then the focus shifted to the analysis of web servers and DBMS, and gradually we came to business applications and ERP-systems.  It must be emphasized that our research center has become a unique phenomenon for the Russian information security market: previously, the search for vulnerabilities was carried out haphazardly and irregularly, in the amateur format.  The opening of the DSecRG laboratory brought this activity to a professional level.  Over time, some market players followed the example of Digital Security, creating their own units for searching and analyzing vulnerabilities. <br><br>  <strong>Number of closed vulnerabilities relative to detected</strong> <br><br>  For all the time, DSecRG experts found 318 vulnerabilities, of which 199 were closed by manufacturers, the rest are being worked on.  Now the main direction of our activity is Application Security, in which we will continue to work, striving to occupy leading positions not only in Russia, but also in the world. <br><br>  DSecRG experts found about 0.8% of all vulnerabilities that were closed in the world for 5 years, which exceeds the similar indicators of all Russian companies in the aggregate. <br><br>  <strong>Number of vulnerabilities published in different years</strong> <br><br>  2007 - 2 <br>  2008 - 41 <br>  2009 - 37 <br>  2010 - 26 <br>  2011 - 42 <br>  2012 - 51 <br><br>  <strong>Number of published vulnerabilities in products of key manufacturers</strong> <br><br>  SAP - 93 <br>  Oracle - 19 <br>  Adobe - 5 <br>  WAGO - 4 <br>  VMware - 4 <br>  IBM - 3 <br>  HP - 2 <br>  Microsoft - 1 <br><br>  <strong>Number of published vulnerabilities in various areas</strong> <br><br>  SAP - 93 <br>  Web applications and servers - 58 <br>  ERP and business applications - 26 <br>  ACU TP (SCADA / ICS) - 7 <br>  Other - 6 <br>  DBMS - 5 <br>  RMS - 4 <br><br>  <strong>Vulnerability closing time</strong> <br><br>  The minimum closing time for OpenSource is for Blogcms and 2z developers.  Several vulnerabilities of various kinds were closed in one day! <br>  The average time to close vulnerabilities for open source developers is 30 days. <br>  For OpenSource developers, the longest update was prepared by the Apache consortium - 126 days (a vulnerability in the Apache Geronimo application, marked with the identifier [DSECRG-09-019]). <br><br>  The minimum closing time for commercial companies from Oracle.  The buffer overflow vulnerability in Oracle DBMS has been closed for 28 days. <br>  The average time for vulnerabilities to close for commercial companies is 295 days. <br>  The longest update was prepared by Oracle - 1214 days (a vulnerability in the Oracle Business Intelligence application marked with [DSECRG-12-040]). <br><br><h4>  Research work </h4><br>  During the work of DSecRG, 42 large studies were prepared, the results of which were various articles, reports and speeches at conferences. <br><br>  <strong>Published studies in various fields</strong> <br><br><ul><li>  Application Security - 30 <br><ul><li>  Business Applications - 15 <br><ul><li>  SAP - 11 </li><li>  Other - 4 </li></ul></li></ul></li><li>  Databases - 3 </li><li>  Banking - 4 </li><li>  Mobile - 2 </li><li>  Other - 6 </li><li>  Exploitation - 8 </li><li>  Embedded - 2 </li><li>  SCADA - 1 </li><li>  Forensics - 1 </li></ul><br>  * Some studies fall into several categories at once. <br><br>  <strong>Number of studies in different years</strong> <br><br>  2008 - 2 <br>  2009 - 3 <br>  2010 - 11 <br>  2011 - 11 <br>  2012 - 15 <br><br>  <strong>Studies of various laboratory staff</strong> <br><br>  Polyakov - 21 <br>  Sintsov - 11 <br>  Evdokimov - 4 <br>  Tyurin - 3 <br>  Chastuhin - 3 <br>  Svistunovich ‚Äì2 <br>  Minozhenko - 2 <br>  Cherbov - 1 <br>  Neyolov - 1 <br><br>  <strong><a href="http://dsecrg.ru/files/pub/pdf/RBS2009-2011.pdf">Security of RBS systems</a> (2009-2011)</strong> <br><br>  The first study in the field of remote banking security in Russia.  Previously, very little was said on this topic, but the problems raised by DSecRG experts attracted the attention of experts from various organizations of the information security industry.  The popularity of the security analysis market segment has grown significantly. <br><br>  <strong><a href="http://dsecrg.com/files/pub/pdf/Writing%2520JIT-Spray%2520Shellcode%2520for%2520fun%2520and%2520profit.pdf">Adaptation technology JIT-Spray</a> (2010)</strong> <br><br>  This study improved the Adobe Flash attack technique to circumvent DEP and ASLR.  As a result of the work done, the attack time was reduced by 100 times!  In addition, the study showed that not only the JIT-engine of Adobe Flash, but also the JavaScript-engine of the browser Safari is subject to a similar attack.  The results of this work were subsequently used by many offensive security companies around the world. <br><br>  <strong><a href="http://erpscan.ru/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/%25D0%2591%25D0%25B5%25D0%25B7%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BF%25D0%25B0%25D1%2581%25D0%25BD%25D0%25BE%25D1%2581%25D1%2582%25D1%258C-SAP-%25D0%25B2-%25D1%2586%25D0%25B8%25D1%2584%25D1%2580%25D0%25B0%25D1%2585-%25D1%2580%25D0%25B5%25D0%25B7%25D1%2583%25D0%25BB%25D1%258C%25D1%2582%25D0%25B0%25D1%2582%25D1%258B-%25D0%25B3%25D0%25BB%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B1%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BB%25D1%258C%25D0%25BD%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B3%25D0%25BE-%25D0%25B8%25D1%2581%25D1%2581%25D0%25BB%25D0%25B5%25D0%25B4%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B2%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B8%25D1%258F-2007-2011.pdf">SAP security in numbers</a> (2007-2012)</strong> <br><br>  SAP Global Security Survey 2007-2011.  It was published in two languages ‚Äã‚Äãand received the InfoSecurity Product Guide award in the Advertising nomination.  The study covered all aspects of SAP security - from vulnerability statistics and descriptions of the top 5 vulnerabilities to the analysis of SAP systems available via the Internet in a particular country of the world, and statistics on the most common versions and patches. <br><br>  <strong><a href="http://erpscan.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/SSRF-vs-Businness-critical-applications-whitepaper.pdf">SSRF and Business Applications</a> (2012-2013)</strong> <br><br>  The study was first presented at the BlackHat conference and made popular the study of a new class of attacks.  Together with other independent SSRF attacks, this publication ranked 2nd in the list of the 10 most interesting attacks on web applications in 2012. <br><br>  <strong><a href="http://dsecrg.ru/files/pub/pdf/Mobile_Banking_Security_2012.pdf">Mobile Banking</a> (2012-2013)</strong> <br><br>  A static analysis of the client-side code of mobile payment applications for iOS and Android from more than 30 Russian banks was conducted.  It turned out that all the considered applications contain at least one vulnerability that allows attacking the bank or its clients. <br><br><h4>  Speeches at international conferences </h4><br>  In 2009, the laboratory made a breakthrough in development, starting to perform research at international technical conferences.  In the West, we were not the first (ElcomSoft spoke abroad 10 years ago), but Digital Security took the participation of Russian researchers to a new level, significantly increasing the presence of information security experts at key conferences.  For three years, DSecRG has appeared at 36 conferences in 20 countries of Europe, Asia and the USA, and we continue to work in this direction, conquering new continents.  It is gratifying that the initiative of Digital Security was supported by other companies and independent researchers.  By 2013, the presence of the company reports at international conferences became the norm, just as a couple of years ago the availability of thanks from manufacturers became the norm. <br><br>  <strong>Number of speeches at different conferences</strong> <br><br>  CONFidence - 6 <br>  BlackHat - 5 <br>  HITB - 4 <br>  Deepsec - 2 <br>  SecurityByte - 2 <br>  HackerHalted - 2 <br>  Troopers - 1 <br>  Source - 1 <br>  t2.fi - 1 <br>  BruCON - 1 <br>  InfoSecurity Kuwait - 1 <br>  Just4Meeting - 1 <br>  Defcon - 1 <br>  RSA - 1 <br>  Nullcon - 1 <br>  HackTivity - 1 <br>  IT-SA - 1 <br>  Syscan360 - 1 <br>  SAP Security Summit - 1 <br>  Hashdays - 1 <br>  PoC - 1 <br><br>  <strong>The number of performances in different countries</strong> <br><br>  USA - 6 <br>  Poland - 5 <br>  Germany - 3 <br>  Netherlands - 3 <br>  India - 3 <br>  China - 2 <br>  Malaysia - 2 <br>  Austria - 2 <br>  Czech Republic - 1 <br>  Spain - 1 <br>  Belgium - 1 <br>  Portugal - 1 <br>  Kuwait - 1 <br>  Hungary - 1 <br>  Switzerland - 1 <br>  Korea - 1 <br>  UAE - 1 <br>  Finland - 1 <br><br>  <strong>The number of performances in different years</strong> <br><br>  2010 - 9 <br>  2011‚Äì 9 <br>  2012 - 19 <br><br>  <strong>The number of performances in various areas</strong> <br><br><ul><li>  Application Security - 30 <br><ul><li>  Business Applications - 15 <br><ul><li>  SAP - 11 </li><li>  Other - 4 </li></ul></li></ul></li><li>  Databases - 3 </li><li>  Banking - 4 </li><li>  Mobile - 2 </li><li>  Other - 6 </li><li>  Exploitation - 8 </li><li>  Embedded - 2 </li><li>  SCADA - 1 </li><li>  Forensics - 1 </li></ul><br>  <strong>The number of speeches of different speakers</strong> <br><br>  Polyakov - 25 <br>  Sintsov - 5 <br>  Evdokimov - 4 <br>  Chastuhin - 4 <br>  Minozhenko - 2 <br>  Neyolov - 2 <br><br><h4>  Projects and community initiatives </h4><br>  As far as possible, we try to participate in various projects and initiatives.  Let us dwell on the most important of them. <br><br>  <strong><a href="http://zeronights.ru/">ZeroNights</a></strong> <br><br>  Organization of the annual international conference ZeroNights in Moscow and St. Petersburg.  The only uncompromisingly technical conference in Russia devoted to the latest methods of hacking and protection, in 2012 gathered 600 people and more than 50 speakers and was noted by the authoritative publication SCMagazine as the most significant to attend in 2013, along with such monsters as BlackHat, HITB and Infiltrate. <br><br>  <strong>Defcon Russia</strong> <br><br>  The project was created by employees of the research laboratory.  This is a unique platform for training young professionals, which allows them to obtain unique knowledge and skills and exchange experience during informal meetings.  Collects more than 50 people a month, it is a prototype of the ZeroNights conference.  To date, 15 meetings have been successfully held. <br><br>  <strong>Owasp</strong> <br><br>  In the OWASP project, we run an OWASP-EAS subproject dedicated to the security of business applications.  The first version of the subproject was introduced in 2010 and included a description of the main threats to business applications and a methodology for assessing the security of business applications.  After a long break due to the collection of information and analysis of systems, in 2013, serious work began on version 2. <br><br>  <strong>Project BaseCamp</strong> <br><br>  Participation in the project dedicated to the analysis of the safety of the automated process control system, namely vulnerabilities in programmable controllers  We analyzed the WAGO PLC and the kingSCADA system. <br><br>  <strong>Metasploit</strong> <br><br>  Participation in the Metasploit project, development of exploits for the Oracle DBMS and other convenient tools to assist in the conduct of pentest. <br><br>  <strong>Bounty programs</strong> <br><br>  Participation in virtually all vulnerability scan programs.
