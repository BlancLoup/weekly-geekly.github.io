  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Knowledge is needed for action, action for knowledge</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Once our team was big, and the projects were small.  The whole volume of work was placed in the head of every person, and every change in the client‚Äôs requirements, every important decision came from ‚Äúheart to heart‚Äù, with the hope of email. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  The complexity of the projects grew, the mailbox swelled from the letters, and then a new trend appeared: wiki!  You can now stack documents and knowledge in one place!  More precisely, in two - one, visible to all employees, and the other - visible to top managers.  Well, somehow.  Tasks and time at the time we were tracking in Rational ClearCase, and the plan was drawn in MS Project.  All anything, but there was no connection between these three systems.  The decisions made by the manager came to the team in the ‚Äúfly + mail‚Äù mode, who missed that one.  The client‚Äôs decisions were delivered by the heroic efforts of the team, most often the most unhappy person in the world, by the project manager: through manually generated reports.  The number of systems changed, but the essence remained the same: difficultly compatible data, the complexity of instantly linking all aspects of the task. <br><br>  Everything is aggravated by the fact that in a modern company the division of people into "performers" and "thinkers" no longer works.  We have to admit: every person in the team has needs. <ul><li>  Quickly delve into the task, cover any aspects </li><li>  Make decisions seeing all the connections between requirements and other tasks. </li><li>  See what other people are doing right now and synchronize their actions (transparency of the process) </li><li>  Store and share any results of your work - solutions. </li></ul><br>  In knowledge-based organizations (KIO, knowledge-intensive organizations) any task, any project, is in fact a transformation of one knowledge into another.  Knowledge is necessary for action, each action creates new knowledge.  For example, you build a cottage village.  And even the task of ‚Äúmaking a foundation for the home‚Äù creates new knowledge: which contractor is best suited, what terrain characteristics were discovered in the process, something else. <br><br>  That is why there is a need for a common knowledge platform.  In a typical organization, there are at least three processes that are eager to use new technical capabilities to increase clarity and efficiency.  These are finance, customer relations and the ‚Äúproduction process‚Äù.  And even between these three there should be tight integration.  Large companies use ERP as a knowledge-for-action platform, but what do small and medium businesses do: price matters, price matters.

      We took the basic idea, the basic idea of ‚Äã‚Äãlinking tasks (task management) and knowledge (ECM, enterprise content management).  ‚ÄúPeople and their interactions are more important than process and development tools,‚Äù as the agile manifesto says, Agile Manifesto.  Studies show that a knowledge worker spends up to 80% of his time searching for the necessary information, and only 20% on activities.  Thanks to Google, it has reduced the time of searching the Internet.  But this is not enough business.  The power of business information is in the connections between elements. <br><br>  Connecting people, knowledge and actions to improve the effectiveness of the project and the company - this is the main task of the <a href="http://comindwork.ru/">Comindwork</a> system, in which we try to implement our ideas and experience in project management.  In our model, time is the gap between these three components, reducing the gap is increasing the speed of the project. <br><img src="http://nadprof.kiev.ua/i/people-know-act.gif"><br>  We divide knowledge into several categories, according to the lifetime: <ol><li>  Net tasks, todo, which do not require additional communications to solve.  Examples of todo: ‚Äúcall customer‚Äù, ‚Äúmake an appointment‚Äù. </li><li>  Incidents, cases - knowledge that is collected for a separate task, which is unlikely to be repeated.  The task is her decision history, messaging.  Example of tasks: ‚Äúto parse the areas of responsibility‚Äù, ‚Äúto create the content of the main page of the site‚Äù, ‚Äúto write a business plan‚Äù. </li><li>  Wiki pages as the most long-lived and potentially useful knowledge.  Useful as part of a single project, as well as inter-project knowledge.  Examples of pages: ‚Äúserver list‚Äù, ‚Äúmarketing strategy‚Äù, ‚Äúproject plan‚Äù. </li></ol><br>  There are plenty to choose from.  The main thing is to ask the right questions, and quickly generate answers. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/38005/">https://habr.com/ru/post/38005/</a></p>
