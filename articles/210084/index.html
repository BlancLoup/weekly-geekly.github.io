And as a creative work, it is impossible to fly (create) right away, only to modestly apprentice.  And they, adherents of total clarity, are not embarrassed that the same fractals are in principle not representable without a computer, and pseudo-living behavioral systems fascinate with their behavior.

      Indeed, the computer is incapable of self-initialization.  People also do not initialize themselves.  During the boot the computer goes a long way.  Though not as long as a man in 25 years. After downloading, he lives and manages himself to the best of his abilities and in the outline of his tasks.  Man too.  And yes, theoretically, a person can deliver tasks to himself.  But, practically, everything is not so rosy and with autonomy and with a "measure of ability."  Compared to a human, an incredibly fast computer can be ‚Äúrewrapped‚Äù for a variety of tasks.  Yes, this is an accumulated baggage of software.  Well, people did not immediately build. <br><br>  Why the ‚Äú <b>using</b> ‚Äù effect cannot be considered as communication with a computer or even a process of co-creation? <br>  So much sealed intelligence in programs.  Local intelligence, but what speeds are there for him ... And ide-eshki with compilers are animals, not programs.  So much can tell, and order so that you can not argue.  And then these pauses during compilation, fan noise, cunning extra-semantic errors.  Who thought them out so smart?  And who makes beautiful mistakes? .. And how does the distance between the keys affect the frequency and quality of errors?  And the resolution of the monitor and the rhythm of the breaks for surfing, games, movies, chats, mail?  But there is still a need to install new Windows, and then some old ones become old ... And then again for the cause, but it is already some other: something has become more interesting and convex, and something on the contrary - it already seems irrelevant.  And the new color of the desktop brings ... As a result, it turns out a little something else, and even much different than what was thought at the beginning.  The question is: who is to blame and whether it was necessary the way it was intended or better this way - how did it ‚Äúself‚Äù, in the process, work out?  And who is better for this?  And who is more interesting? <br><br><hr><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/4a4/850/399/4a48503995cf7da21713aa730409750f.jpg"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/b1a/e90/682/b1ae9068250a9a8b149f0b52ac7e1a65.jpg"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/c7d/d49/749/c7dd49749afb437b50b982a0ea7ed6b5.jpg"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/4eb/613/25f/4eb61325f56c281d08c6b5595ecc256b.jpg"><br><br>  Marius Watz (Marius Watz) met with a computer in 11 years.  In 20, he became interested in creating organic objects in 2 and 3 dimensions.  Working in graphic design, Marius Vats finds many interesting reasons for using abstract graphics to visualize real data.  Such, for example, are the papers [3], [4], [5], [7].  But who would have guessed this, if not for that special explanation ... <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/a94/030/f6b/a94030f6b61c07dc2b50f21f1db7d9a5.jpg"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/20b/4ae/fcb/20b4aefcb55f617eaf659a84fff3e1f7.jpg"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/4aa/71d/e16/4aa71de16619adabd8c8be2a1c2ac0f7.jpg"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/530/a1d/fc3/530a1dfc34a386c24bd1ff4af22e333c.jpg"><br><br>  Marius Watts on Flickr: <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/watz">www.flickr.com/photos/watz</a> <br>  Marius program for abstract online drawing: <a href="http://www.unlekker.net/proj/abstracts/abstracts.html">www.unlekker.net/proj/abstracts/abstracts.html</a> <br><hr><br>  Perhaps an empty question, but if everything was not quite ‚Äúaccording to Darwin,‚Äù then it is interesting: <br>  Did man participate in the creation of himself, while he was not yet fully created? .. <br>  And generally, why is creation called Creation? <br><br>  On the "human processor" it is impossible to chase a computer, where it is really strong. <br><br>  Yes, the computer serves man.  No, man serves the computer. <br>  The computer has the right to hang at any time, the person has attempts to return it to useful work without any guarantee of results.  The computer can ask for a new program, the user has the right to think that he wanted it. <br>  Below logic, transistors and their p-n junctions, macro-life boils, potentials whip over the edge ... Who can guarantee that the electrons (what we call them) do not think?  Do they always behave decently and appropriately to the picture we made about them?  Would they like a person to notice their intelligence, if she were present? <br>  What for?  What is the point?  Who can guarantee that a person even notices intelligence that is different from his own? <br><br>  But, if all of the same suddenly ... That is interesting: What does the computer like more?  Cinema, demoscene, cartoons, screensavers, music ... or office mixers and all kinds of bookkeeping?  How does his character change if he is?  The new computer smells new, and what does the old smell like? <br><br><hr><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/a07/86d/f3b/a0786df3b36b4869bf53255b1a83ffa0.jpg"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/994/e64/d5e/994e64d5efc0e45faccbf518e4057000.jpg"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/4a3/78e/99d/4a378e99d5ad9580e6a7c1280ecca0f6.jpg"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/5b3/10d/b69/5b310db698a2931e88a3f406edc7caad.jpg"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/1ca/b82/6de/1cab826de13df91a0a9d31de40dfbd07.jpg"><br><br>  Among the variety of 3-dimensional modeling packages, animation, and pinting there are some that do not even hope for the attention of large studios engaged in the film industry and advertising.  But they are guaranteed the love of artists working (enjoying) in the field of creating abstract graphics.  And not only, often the creators of such programs themselves do not foresee all applications, because so much has been invested in non-standard ones.  This is the software package - GroBoto. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/755/d3d/6f3/755d3d6f359a7488ca38d93b38933877.jpg"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/745/1eb/aec/7451ebaec400affa6e8f6c8ce7b14174.jpg"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/e4a/1c7/eb9/e4a1c7eb94592a4d8e1a9ed3c917a1b2.jpg"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/cbf/515/454/cbf515454863311a7338a3eeb3d0e50b.jpg"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/cf3/3b9/1b5/cf33b91b5baabb7d0cb1c44897b28f79.jpg"><br><br>  GroBoto's modeling tools are more plant-functional.  This is a continuation of the realization of a person‚Äôs dream of a truly feyeric brush.  One that can "itself" and does not constrain inspiration with scrupulous sluggishness.  The concept of primitives in GroBoto differs significantly from its analogues.  These are bots, functional objects, the play of which gives rise to a riotous variety of abstract, organic and technogenically similar forms. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/71b/baf/809/71bbaf8091b41256188e4116fdbe85e1.jpg"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/6be/e4b/8d4/6bee4b8d47d05cfce38e482acf2e41ab.jpg"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/f4a/7dc/197/f4a7dc197cda8acf668639f2ec09c531.jpg"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/1df/6c6/ef9/1df6c6ef94066d213daae995c8a3a62f.jpg"><br><br>  Some artists actively use modeling programs to create blanks, which are then transformed: they are painted in the classical painting technique.  Such a construction process not only simplifies the work, it often gives new ideas and opportunities.  In this case, the primary adjustment of the interaction of forms, the formulation of light, composition is unusually more technological and flexible than purely manual methods. <br><br>  GroBoto website: www.braid.com/groboto-site <br><hr><br>  A computer is put behind a plow, harnessed to games ... <br><br>  Computer - landfill for modeling.  The world is a testing ground. <br>  Sometimes on the contrary, sometimes there is no difference.  What are they both not the world, what are both not computers? <br>  Both of them are so honest that then ‚Äúall this‚Äù has to be raked.  Difficult-regular processes generate unpredictable data in real time.  Often such that they are easier to write off in chance than to analyze.  Experts will argue, but will they cope with the forecast of these results in real time and without assistive devices? <br><br>  A computer is what you see about it: i.e.  relatively speaking - the computer, and the fact that it is not visible about it.  And a person is a person: his visible and invisible part.  A person equipped with one computer versus another computer is a person between two computers.  He tries to catch up with the first with the help of the second, but does not have time for both.  Then he writes himself a program that is all that is possible, portray more clearly.  That is, he writes himself a filter, bothers with visualization.  Let it not have passed without torment, but very well.  Now one computer is enough for him.  The man still does not have time for bare figures, but he does not need it anymore.  He already understands, recognizes, and therefore - has time.  He looks at the picture and says, for example: <br><br>  - ABOUT!  And here everything is not quite by accident.  And I would even say that it looks a lot like ... <br><br>  And this is already interesting, in fact.  The analysis went.  Man is a champion in recognizing even very, very difficult images.  If, of course, they are educated as they should, that is, effectively, that is, to the best of their habit.  In this case, the computer for a man does not have time.  To draw (process) - can, and recognize - no!  But yes, something can, but so far not at that level.  A person is capable of such a visual analysis that computers do not even dream about.  It is even more capable if the computer helps him with the help of a person who helps the computer with the help of a computer.  At this level, relatively speaking, semantic ... but the level below?  Level deeper?  What does a person have inside and what did the person want to understand about himself by creating a computer?  And how did the computer participate in its own creation?  How did you resist, how did you help, where did you direct, what did you want?  Do computers have their own websites on the Internet?  We are incomprehensible, or vice versa, somehow suspiciously too understandable ... Here, for example, about computer hardware - isn't it their sites?  Do not they provoke an increase in the number of their own population? <br><br>  Initialization of the random generator gives a new starting number and a completely new chain of subsequently generated numbers.  The basis for its generation is usually the current date and time, up to the smallest division available for this type of computer.  It would seem that everything depends on the person, on the moment in which he launched the program.  But ... the sum of the smallest and major delays in downloading, executing, interruptions to the execution of other programs ... And now the second participant in the randomness of the process is a computer.  Why?  for he could have delayed more, and he could have less.  And the word - ‚Äúcould‚Äù is quite appropriate here.  The current flowing in his veins, like blood in human beings, gives him life, energy.  And already the computer itself, with its complex and regular structure, gives itself opportunity, influence.  It draws energy into a structural sequence of actions. <br><br><hr>  ChaosTV.  From English haos - fell off "with", it turned out HaosTv.  The program behaves like a TV, but instead of the usual channels - chaos, such, sort and rastakoy.  A lot of chaos: visual noise, and chaotic, and as if something resembling, and in some places altogether something similar.  In some, the current stereotypes of perception are clearly manifest, scenes from the film just watched are seen in the noise, or ... Try to move your finger over the most classic TV noise, in complete chaos, you suddenly see the lines that you have drawn.  With a relaxed look, the chaotic dynamics of the picture seems to follow the thought, demonstrating movement to the right, then inwards, then outwards. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/701/2f9/607/7012f9607f742f18b83935937c4a015b.jpg"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/5f4/8e4/5de/5f48e45de4537cbd3d2bb142791ee97f.jpg"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/849/180/6f8/8491806f83e8b7f0cf46f31f79fd5def.jpg"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/473/008/324/473008324e7c5096d0097ef61414b49a.jpg"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/f0d/ff5/648/f0dff56487be2febe1a90bcbf65c495c.jpg"><br><br>  The program is interactive, but if you don‚Äôt touch it for a while, it switches to the random channel rotation mode.  The man is used to the connectedness of what is happening on the screen.  What will happen if instead of connectedness look chaos?  And if you look for a long time?  And if you then look around at ordinary objects and people?  How does prolonged observation of chaos affect the subsequent perception of a normal, orderly world? <br><br>  Software Site: <a href="http://nemehanika.ru/haostv">nemehanika.ru/haostv</a> <br><hr><br>  In the English part of the Internet, the words ‚ÄúComputing Art‚Äù, ‚ÄúAlgoritm Atr‚Äù, ‚ÄúDigital Art‚Äù, ‚ÄúGenerative Art‚Äù thrown at Google will lead us to a host of truly computer art resources.  It looks extremely interesting.  For a person, such images are both abstract and associatively complete at the same time.  Maybe this is sad, but for a person in general, everything is associatively full, even if it is empty. <br><br>  In the Russian segment of the Internet on the most diverse requests of this topic - the catch will not be even one hundredth of such a saturated one.  Moreover, you shouldn‚Äôt look for a combination of ‚ÄúComputer Art‚Äù - you‚Äôll run into a huge amount of resources with a suggestion to translate the lessons of Photoshop, Corel Draw, etc., ‚Äúwritten off‚Äù from each other.  Everything is very practical.  Computer not like it!  nu, v smysle - emu eto kak-to fu-uu ... <br><br>  So what does a computer like?  Put yourself in his place: <br>  What would we love if we were computers? <br><br>  Programs that program themselves, which themselves draw and write music.  Listen to her and draw. <br>  Not text, not tables, not performance tests, no ... Maybe monitor pixels crave more harmony?  Perhaps the regional incoherence of textual documents, financial reports, endless fencing in threads is what makes the monitor, the video card and the processor tiring and old. <br><br>  Perhaps, and maybe not.  Okay: <br>  How do computers age?  The question, humanly, is almost understandable.  Both materially and physically. <br>  How do people get old?  They say there are some options and ... maybe better like this: Where do people get old? <br><br><hr><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/c70/c40/449/c70c40449dec848a743358fedb9fff07.jpg"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/ae1/e24/c04/ae1e24c04b764f8e476e405af52a1375.jpg"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/0cd/488/fca/0cd488fca21a0d4fecec5a7812039761.jpg"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/6e8/4b0/02c/6e84b002cbe4b796803a45c8b395e571.jpg"><br><br>  Compiled in Java, all very graphic and musical Processing is nice and polished.

And everything - physics, chemistry, gravity, firefighters, the law of conservation of relevance, money.  So why?  On such a beautiful, free machine, like a computer, to create something like what she wanted from birth, dreamed of being more-more-more abstract, free of all these buckets, rags, money, and phrases like ‚Äúlife, my boy, she know dictates its laws. " <br><br>  That's interesting, at a certain current stage: How close are people at all to understanding natural sufficiency in the direction of each of the real needs?  And what if "no much"?

And we will be happy ... <br>  Until now, it was not, but now, it means - it will be.  Happiness is money.  And nothing that money competes with the value of life.  It takes time to understand, but it is not there, you need a lot of good ... It needs more and more money too.  True, prices have overtaken both benefit and money, which means that we must work faster and longer, then the entertainment should be clearer, there is no time to ‚Äúdrive in‚Äù ...

This is from such a place in the network - Generator.x. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/ca2/b31/0f2/ca2b310f256752ec18c5aa2a9ac41756.jpg"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/33a/b10/e8f/33ab10e8f9f4d2aa565a0df77a184362.jpg"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/a19/790/aae/a19790aaef92d5279b6478a893696487.jpg"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/282/328/97f/28232897f6a3a6d66444ebb62a42548f.jpg"><br><br>  Under the general slogan of Art from code, without hiding, lies a group warehouse-exhibition of the achievements of powerful and sophisticated open-source software for creating non- and abstract graphics, sound, and forms for subsequent cutting out with a plasma jigsaw.  And almost all of this is based on ... Yes, yes, again Processing.  By the way, about the brevity of the code for it.  An interactive, recursive, modest, but nice visualization of the tree fits into the following lines of code: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/df1/62d/0a6/df162d0a65d12f68c4c561ef939024a5.gif"><br><br>  And only that ... The final phase of the tree is especially amusing.  And enough about Processing, otherwise it will never end. <br><br>  Generator.x website: http: // <a href="http://www.generatorx.no/">www.generatorx.no</a> <br>  Over 6,000 works by Generator.x participants on Flickr: <a href="http://www.flickr.com/groups/generatorx">www.flickr.com/groups/generatorx</a> <br><hr><br>  This is where someone asks: ‚ÄúSo, shall we finally talk about abstract art, or not?‚Äù <br><br>  Yes, and only talking about it ... the opposite way. <br>  Being perceived, it does not need additional recommendations.  No such question - is it necessary or not?  There is only the possibility or impossibility to cope with their own perception.  Own interest.  And then, what is it own if uncontrollable? <br>  Here are the clouds, the greatest masters of abstractions.  Often, and it seems absolutely not straining, act unusually inspired.  Notice?  Children say beautiful, abstract things.  Hear?  Computers have long and very well draw abstract canvases.  And ... yes, they are just computers, where did they get this from?  Yes, even if from us.  Us what?  There is nothing and no one to convey such that surprises us ourselves?  Suddenly or even constantly. <br><br><hr>  Liquid Journey is a fascinating series of colorful static and dynamic flash experiments: interactive algorithmic abstractions, randomness, artificial intelligence, imitation of the growth and behavior of living organisms.  Step-by-step description of ideas in the style of presentation, code and related various materials on the topic are attached. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/caa/fa8/2ac/caafa82ac01bfb8c06a22a5288d207c7.jpg"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/404/e72/8bf/404e728bff3ea25fe4e28d5d86e43d18.jpg"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/328/e42/7d6/328e427d6eacfdce5f30044f2c1a9be5.jpg"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/9fe/92c/a03/9fe92ca0300947f67e59aed84e16cc33.jpg"><br><br>  Liquid Journey website: <a href="http://www.liquidjourney.com/">www.liquidjourney.com</a> <br><hr><br>  And then suddenly: "Yes, tell me already, why is this abstract needed?" <br><br>  At least then, to take a break from the concrete.  What is the information consumed by a person from the TV box?  What is her character?  What is the speed?  And harmony?  No, well, the news is yes ... With them, everything is more or less clear.  But here, really, is a mystery: <br><br>  - Why is Nikolai at Zina rat? <br>  - Well, there in the last series, she threw it with the party. <br>  - Nifigase, what a bitch!  Interesting! <br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">That's interesting ... How can it be interesting? The fact that it has already been a million times, and not in the plots, it has even repeated many times in detail ... Maybe this is not an interest, but a corpse of interest? Buried under the mountain supposedly real associative links. Well, how is this Zina really connected with this Nicholas ?:</font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">If you turn off the sound (distracts from the essence of what is happening) - it becomes obvious that, for a start, it is associated with it by a weak and very tired acting game. And the reasons, too, suddenly become intelligible - it's a series. A series is a coffin-movie, as a rule. Playing in a coffin is tiring and boring. But in the smoke breaks, Nikolay and Zina probably already play in a real and inspired manner. There, without fail, it is necessary to exchange a certain number of "very necessary, in production, things." For example, with meaningful and optimism filled phrases about any importance of the bravely performed work ... After all, one must somehow somehow keep all this in a supposedly breathing state. And then you have to change something, and this - God forbid. </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Hey screenwriter, give the heat! But not in real life.</font></font><br><br><hr><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/5a6/172/656/5a6172656781108a61811f1948e6a018.jpg"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/147/c68/cee/147c68cee3f2ba87f0bfb9cee0d02ace.jpg"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/104/e01/4bb/104e014bb0584b7e57941f7b9e89a6b3.jpg"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/661/342/e8a/661342e8a8a25765c430b89cfe9e0221.jpg"><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Do not write about fractals - it would be a small blasphemy, so much is written about them. But ignoring the project Electrics Sheep (Electric Sheep) will not be enough any will - it is unreal beautifully! And it works like this: download and install a client program, which, being a screensaver, renders (very slow process) fractal images or animations - so-called. electric sheep and sends the results to the "homeland", leaving you the final video files and pictures.</font></font><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/a46/013/1e4/a460131e4ac65c2039d175ce2427ae59.jpg"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/631/d03/8e0/631d038e01b00cc3246446e92e172e0a.jpg"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/eac/bfa/59f/eacbfa59fe67c77bcda51363f5d0dc28.jpg"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/44e/fbc/672/44efbc6729098035f4f0ae4a213e4e97.jpg"><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">And, of course, no one forbids the construction of the ‚Äúembryos‚Äù of sheep for themselves (to script-tune). With static images will be simpler, while creating an interesting, smooth fractal animation is a task that requires a very inventive code and fine-tune the parameters. At the slightest movement, changes often occur - drastic, and successfully developing fragments still strive to escape from the frame for many miles to the side. </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Electrics Sheep: </font></font><a href="http://community.electricsheep.org/"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">community.electricsheep.org</font></font></a> <font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> site </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Images are also taken from Flickr by the following filter: </font></font><br> <a href="http://www.flickr.com/search/%3Fq%3Delectric%2Bsheep%26ct%3D2%26mt%3Dall%26adv%3D1"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">www.flickr.com/search/?q=electric+sheep&amp;ct=2&amp;mt=all&amp;adv=1</font></font></a> <br><hr><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Almost everything between living beings is an act of communication, perception and follow-up, often completely optional, but almost inevitable reaction. </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">How often does one‚Äôs own reaction and chain of reactions about one‚Äôs own reaction (avalanche of self-reflection) overshadow perception, contemplation of what is happening? And if pure perception did happen, how long does it last? Until the category is found. And this is usually very fast.</font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">‚ÄúOh, yes, you, my dear, are a Buddhist!‚Äù, And in this sounds: I know you, Buddhists, and this word ‚Äúmy dear‚Äù is also quite accidental, as the final blow in a combination ... But it‚Äôs still godly, and if Baptists will write down? Feel the difference in sound? Buddhist being much more prestigious is a more beautiful model. A longer shelf, more substantial, and neighbors more pleasant. But above there is always a shelf higher, more elegant. And there, as usual, you can not get spontaneously, only if someone puts. So you have to negotiate. About everything. </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">So they run one after the other and vice versa. They agree on the change of categories: they dress, they are painted, the clever words teach, they buy a new car, they change yoga for qigong, the office for the office. Fifteen minutes feel good, then again I want something ... more abruptly. That is - to run.</font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Interestingly, did they teach us this way or did they just give everything ready? Gradually, under the guise of real items. As if interesting. So you can completely forget how natural interest looks. What is his smell? Probably the smell of a small miracle, at least ...</font></font><br><br><hr><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/658/3c4/c23/6583c4c230538f2f1a085f28619845f9.jpg"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/a09/470/88e/a0947088e8496c7071805cd01bfe5bf0.jpg"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/e96/093/1d9/e960931d9539ec4ecde6d6956d7183bd.jpg"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/6ce/d99/e01/6ced99e01760dd8f35f9f80134a2828e.jpg"><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Animation of fractals in real time is not too tough for the modern hardware. And unearthly beauty you want at a speed of at least 30 frames per second ... Then it is not Mechanics. Now there are 360 ‚Äã‚Äãabstract animations in it, commonly accepted as screensavers. It works like this: download, install and run on a computer, so-called. Engine non Mechanics. After that, any animation from the site can be viewed. Just clicking their thumbnails. It starts instantly, works smoothly in high resolution, does not repeat. </font></font><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/1b8/f18/dd2/1b8f18dd2f04bcc2ac88164299256b7f.jpg"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/efc/47e/39f/efc47e39f6454c5bb01d2e17c2a25c0c.jpg"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/252/b4a/0b0/252b4a0b0ccfb498b56e4e3b1268d996.jpg"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/fe6/641/052/fe6641052ae2a61f9cfbcb3eca0ebdc7.jpg"><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">You can customize a lot of options. You can even make new non-mechanical screensavers. The site has a detailed description of how. Compared with traditional methods, the process is simple to the obscene and in a good way strange. </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">NeMehanika website: </font></font><a href="http://www.nemehanika.ru/"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">www.neMehanika.ru</font></font></a> <br><hr><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">And why should we count on everything ready? </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">And what if evolution itself arranged us so that ready-made structures, frankly not by ‚Äúour own digestion‚Äù extracted from the mines of reality, offend the very spirit of our being. Who at school loved Russian? Raise your hands ... Or at least their halves.</font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">What kind of language is this? Spread out on rules, suffixes, prefixes, parts-forms ... One-third of the literacy immediately falls on such revelations. Who said that children are more comfortable to learn? It is much more effective and mutually interesting - just (but it is not easier) to give them a moderately saturated, moderately non-trivial material. And talk with them about it, argue ... So, the structure of understanding the language of children will continue to grow themselves, naturally. As a result, it will be possible to merge two unpleasant subjects together: Russian with literature. After all, there is no intelligible reason to try to deprive the "new people" of a personal attitude to the extraction and preparation of knowledge. </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Only the structure collected [practically] personally becomes truly native and effective. </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Because it has a degree of trust consistent with the responsibility for it.</font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> So, about abstract art ... Something I wanted to say, very specific. </font></font> For example: <br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">If, all the same, there is no intelligible reason to be chancellor, darth vader and clone droid ... </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Maybe try to go to the future?</font></font></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/210084/">https://habr.com/ru/post/210084/</a></p>
