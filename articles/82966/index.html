But in 2010, these methods and methods will reach a new level and will finally be included in the tools of each modern communication agency. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  <b>Banners and mediyka work less</b> <br><br><br><br><img src="http://drop.io/download/public/x5xj77wilkmi2t0khauq/625e85edafca0346327ffcffd1ff6369dc6094f5/c9c0a470-d84b-012b-69d0-fa1f51dd2b94/99d891f0-f22b-012c-8154-f0aa1172bf44/v2/thumbnail_large" height="329" width="500"><br><br><br>  Do you notice banners?  Me not.  Many of my friends too.  Most geeks are banner-cutters in browsers or various <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/1865" title="adbloki">adbloki</a> .  OK, they are far from everyone, and media advertising works well with proper media planning.  But, you see, this kind of advancement is becoming increasingly secondary. <br><br>  <b>The context is even more personalized.</b> <br><br><br><br><img src="http://drop.io/download/public/x5xj77wilkmi2t0khauq/49d9b43015f5ede7c8951fe4ac036e12e6d5c5a2/c9c0a470-d84b-012b-69d0-fa1f51dd2b94/9ae73be0-f22b-012c-07e1-f22e4a7a4300/v2/thumbnail_large" height="480" width="600"><br><br><br>  One of the reasons for the decline of media advertising for a year is the <a href="http://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%259A%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BD%25D1%2582%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BA%25D1%2581%25D1%2582%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B0%25D1%258F_%25D1%2580%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BA%25D0%25BB%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BC%25D0%25B0" title="context">context</a> .  So, in 2010 he will become even more meticulous and will know everything about you, thanks to the efforts of our favorite search giants.  They already know about us more than we do about yourself.  Do you remember what you did a year ago at the same time, what you watched and read about during the past six months?  They remember. <br><br>  <b>Advertising and PR-agencies are increasingly using promotion in social networks.</b> <br><br><br><br><br><img src="http://drop.io/download/public/x5xj77wilkmi2t0khauq/719e0e67197e48658fc525f7bef914416aa3db24/c9c0a470-d84b-012b-69d0-fa1f51dd2b94/a0ed9900-f22b-012c-d379-fc17a00ce2b9/v2/thumbnail_large" height="344" width="372"><br><br><br>  In early 2009, advertising agencies that resorted to the services of social promotion and viral promo could be counted on the fingers.  At the end of the same year, it became a fashion trend.  In 2010, every self-respecting communication agency will offer <a href="http://www.google.com/search%3Fclient%3Dsafari%26amp%3Brls%3Den%26amp%3Bq%3D%25D0%25BF%25D1%2580%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B4%25D0%25B2%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B6%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B5%2B%25D0%25B2%2B%25D1%2581%25D0%25BE%25D1%2586%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BB%25D1%258C%25D0%25BD%25D1%258B%25D1%2585%2B%25D1%2581%25D0%25B5%25D1%2582%25D1%258F%25D1%2585%26amp%3Bie%3DUTF-8%26amp%3Boe%3DUTF-8" title="social media promotion services">social media promotion services</a> .  Let not the main service, but these methods will firmly take root among the PR people, marketers and advertisers of all stripes. <br><br>  <b>SEO and PR merge</b> <br><br><br><br><br><img src="http://drop.io/download/public/x5xj77wilkmi2t0khauq/383d6ad120736e3bcb618eb478174269df1988db/c9c0a470-d84b-012b-69d0-fa1f51dd2b94/a461bc00-f22b-012c-3558-f515c11a5115/v2/thumbnail_large" height="480" width="513"><br><br><br>  You know perfectly well that search engines are getting smarter every year.  Promotion articles has long been staking on professional copywriting, and it is increasingly becoming similar to the classic <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_relations" title="Public Relations">Public Relations</a> .  Increasing the presence in the information space by informing the public about companies and brands.  Previously, PR had a great SEO effect.  Now PR and SEO are siblings. <br><br>  The other side of this question is that <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Search_engine_optimization" title="SEO">SEO is</a> an abbreviation for everyone, so many large SEO companies are trying to get away from it.  Instead, they call themselves something like ‚Äúmedia agencies,‚Äù ‚Äúpromo-agencies,‚Äù or some kind of ‚Äúinternet-promotion agency,‚Äù just to get away from mentioning SEO.  Also, this is a good opportunity to build up from competitors and at least to stand out. <br><br>  <b>Automatic promotion systems become an integral part of advertising campaigns.</b> <br><br><br><br><img src="http://drop.io/download/public/x5xj77wilkmi2t0khauq/b05449e1d26217a3c86b3f815d0075491fb6adf7/c9c0a470-d84b-012b-69d0-fa1f51dd2b94/e42278d0-f22f-012c-0697-f6f66f8ff5af/v2/thumbnail_large" height="185" width="590"><br><br><br>  <a href="http://blogun.ru/" title="Blogun">Blogun</a> in 2010 will become a household name, if there is no decent competitors.  He is praised, scolded, loved, hated, but most users on the Internet mention Blogun when discussing advertising in the blogosphere.  For a couple of years, he ousted all more or less worthy competitors and scored the largest number of bloggers and advertisers.  An important reason for this was the constant improvement and the addition of additional features and conveniences in the system, although it still lacks some drawbacks. <br><br>  <b>Advertising in mobile gadgets and iPhone applications is developing</b> <br><br><br><br><br><img src="http://drop.io/download/public/x5xj77wilkmi2t0khauq/fe946d3c8ff1885852345f6669d906ea2f87f8f2/c9c0a470-d84b-012b-69d0-fa1f51dd2b94/9fc25590-f22b-012c-47b6-f85af4b26eb3/v2/thumbnail_large" height="355" width="500"><br><br><br>  Everyone knows that <a href="http://blog.admob.com/2009/11/09/google-to-acquire-admob/" title="Google bought">Google bought</a> <a href="http://www.admob.com/" title="Admob">AdMob</a> for $ 750 million at the end of 2009, and this is no accident.  Although most of us are not paying attention to advertising in applications and games, mobile devices are becoming more powerful, convenient and fast.  The Internet is increasingly penetrating our cars, public transport, summer houses, regions and various remote locations, where there is often only a mobile terminal at hand. <br><br>  <b>Facebook is becoming the main social network.</b> <br><br><br><img src="http://drop.io/download/public/x5xj77wilkmi2t0khauq/17fccbb16e6da7397c3541aa78176492801b2efc/c9c0a470-d84b-012b-69d0-fa1f51dd2b94/9d088bd0-f22b-012c-e43b-f72569faaf5d/v2/thumbnail_large" height="288" width="460"><br><br><br>  Perhaps, it should be added that it will become the most fashionable and modern social network in Russia in 2010, where all modern people will rush, loving convenience and lack of spam, as well as unique and convenient opportunities to maximize the spending of their life and time in the information reality.  According to Anton Nosik, <a href="http://www.facebook.com/" title="Facebook">Facebook is</a> now in our country the most unpopular, but the most "elite" network, as it is now concentrated people with good education, decision-makers and various trend-setters.  Schoolchildren there still miss because of the inability to listen to pirated music and the lack of porn. <br><br><br>  <b>Twitter finally seize marketers</b> <br><br><br><br><img src="http://drop.io/download/public/x5xj77wilkmi2t0khauq/88ee71d83d923d762172f92e8cbd9244916ea405/c9c0a470-d84b-012b-69d0-fa1f51dd2b94/9eac9ad0-f22b-012c-40ab-fe33bb6640c8/v2/thumbnail_large" height="398" width="530"><br><br><br>  Already now you can see how many different money-makers and profit-coaches are on <a href="http://twitter.com/" title="Twitter">Twitter</a> , various success coaches, SEO lovers and other things useful to the fatherland.  More and more companies appear that offer the <a href="http://www.google.com/search%3Fhl%3Den%26amp%3Bsafe%3Doff%26amp%3Bclient%3Dsafari%26amp%3Brls%3Den%26amp%3Bq%3D%25D1%2580%25D0%25B0%25D1%2581%25D0%25BA%25D1%2580%25D1%2583%25D1%2582%25D0%25BA%25D0%25B0%2B%25D1%2582%25D0%25B2%25D0%25B8%25D1%2582%25D1%2582%25D0%25B5%25D1%2580%2B%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BA%25D0%25BA%25D0%25B0%25D1%2583%25D0%25BD%25D1%2582%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B2%26amp%3Baq%3Df%26amp%3Baqi%3D%26amp%3Boq%3D" title="promotion of twitter accounts">promotion of twitter accounts</a> , a million scripts for mass-followers are being written, and PR services are being developed on this social network.  If this goes on, then by the end of 2010 Twitter will consist of 90% success sellers. <br><br>  <b>There will be new services for promotion in all social networks.</b> <br><br><br><br><img src="http://drop.io/download/public/x5xj77wilkmi2t0khauq/03a4b1288852e681801b62190a5ac7ef196b443b/c9c0a470-d84b-012b-69d0-fa1f51dd2b94/d6d49a00-f22f-012c-ff20-fd30210092ca/v2/thumbnail_large" height="346" width="346"><br><br>  Already, several new services for managing public opinion through social media are being beta-tested, there are a lot of new ones coming up.  In mid-2010 and at the end of it, social services will become the main goal of all advertisers on the planet, including Russian craftsmen.  In the coming months, there will be services that allow anyone to earn or advertise something in any social (and not only) account. <br><br>  As I wrote above, 2010 will be the year of ‚Äúsocial advertising‚Äù, social media marketing.  I suggest everyone to wear foil hats and remind you that these are only predictions that do not pretend to be the ultimate truth. <br><br>  Have a nice trip;) </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/82966/">https://habr.com/ru/post/82966/</a></p>
