Make karma tending to a state of equilibrium - zero, with the expiration of inactivity time.  This will keep users on the resource.  For example, a user having fatty karma will be interested to go in sometimes and participate - so that in a month, for example, he will not be left in the novice position with zero and lose the opportunity to write.  Users offended by the system and earned cons will not go away forever and register under a different name, knowing that in the same month their karma will come to zero (during this time they will have time to calm down).

        </script>
      <br>
      2. In order to eliminate the effect of the crowd and its leaders, repeatedly indicated as reasons for unreasonable minus, to introduce a rule according to which in the first few minutes or hours or votes after the post is placed - points are not reflected on the page, that is, the user will have to express his opinion, and not join the first / most. <br><br>  3. Perhaps it is worth considering the need to move to the usual points system (at least the usual 0 and 1 :)).  I managed to notice (and not only me) that the local people are not lazy about putting minuses, but they put the advantages very economically.  And so, I don‚Äôt like it - don‚Äôt touch it - without points it will disappear in the rating anyway, like it - put it +. <br><br>  Here, in order not to multiply, I will add more offers until I forgot (although it may have already been offered): <br><br>  p.4 To give an opportunity to choose individually when posting, people with a karma of at least as much will be able to evaluate and leave comments.  This is for those in Habr√© who believe that only experienced professionals deserve HIS posts (and by this they mean the size of karma). <br><br>  p.5 Make a filter by which you can force to display for yourself on the main (and maybe other) pages only the posts of authors with a karma not lower than X. <br><br>  p.6 Make an individually customizable homepage - so that the user can choose - what to show him (tape, live broadcast, etc.).  Maybe, too, taking into account the points, the karma of the authors, and so on. <br><br>  I‚Äôll add: <br>  Item 7 For the reduction of karma and points, take a ‚Äúcommission‚Äù or ‚Äúfee‚Äù (as you like) in the form of a piece of karma minus.  That is, if I consider that the comment is bad - I can minus it, but from my karma it will lose for example 0.25, if the minus post is goodbye 0.5, if I decide what to punish the person himself by touching his karma - another 0.75 or 1 Then I think about it before I think it, but is it worth it?  A limit on the number of these minuses to remove.  Any whim for your karma :)! <br>  But the reverse action can not be done (+ for +) - in order to avoid cheating and triggering the technique ‚Äúthe cuckoo praises the rooster for ..‚Äù. <br><br>  + <br>  While I was not completely zaminusovali and not excommunicated from the project (writing only in someone's comments - it's like to stumble around the corners with everyone agreeing - this does not suit) I will write perhaps one more sentence: <br>  p.8 Create a separate branch on Habr√© to publish outcast posts, i.e.  those who are in the red.  Without broadcasting to tape, to home or else where you (old-timers) are annoying to see them.  What for?  It's simple - if I get zamus, I won't be able to write my thoughts and questions here (at the expense of comments, I spoke above) and I will probably leave.  But those who remain - if they cannot write their posts - will go and write comments to strangers, often not to the topic, agreeing with everyone or directly asking for karma.  And you need it?  It is for such cases that I propose to make a separate line - they will be able to write posts (even with a minus) - but they will not get into the general flow (at least until karma reaches the norm) and will be visible to friends and those who will go directly to watch this flow .  When you write and control your post - the time to "crap" (as some believe) in other people's posts will remain less.  And there will be no extra reason for a ‚Äúclean‚Äù re-registration.  I hope the thought is stated more or less clearly. <br><br>  UPD: It seems to be already p.9 There is such a fashionable trend in Habr√©, competitions that go deeper into minus.  Considering that this already after -0.01 doesn‚Äôt particularly affect anything, abuses begin (from obvious provocations to mate).  I propose to knock out the basis for such competitions - to limit the display of karma to other users (and maybe to himself) at the level of, for example, -10.  Reached this level?  No matter how much he tried and how much he would not be minus, -10 will be shown, and there will be such a large crowd from which it is impossible to stand out. <br><br>  10 After the karma reaches -7, then the time to write new comments equates to the size of karma (by module), i.e.  I typed some comrade -60, so it will be an hour between the comments. <br><br>  11. Allow the user to select the option to download a comment thread (show all messages, show minimized (ie, not downloaded) all and open new ones, do not download read messages if there are more X, etc.).  The fact is that for example I can‚Äôt open big discussions - 1. breaks down on a certain line 2. re-browse and scroll through the several hundred messages that I don‚Äôt read, 3. this is a reduction in traffic volume, which is also important as the service itself and users. <br><br>  12. Give the ability to convert / use a stock of cartridges intended to change the karma (almost do not use) on the comments. <br><br>  13. To make (by choice) notifications about new comments on posts for which I answered (a la LJ) and not just about comments on my comments.  Sometimes it is convenient. <br><br>  14. Modification of paragraph 2 which I posted already somewhere in another comment - show points (and maybe karma and comments) to the user only after he voted for the post (comments, karma) and before that, for example, show the "?" "  - this will allow to know the personal opinion of the user, and not how it happens - "everyone did it, and I ..." <br><br>  15. They like very much to correct errors in the words of users in the Habr√©, and this is very good (it is possible only because of this and it was worth starting a karma system).  In general, I propose to integrate into Habr a proposal from the Portal Gramot.ru portal to verify a word on a third-party site. <br><br>  16. I understand, it is probably difficult - but why not remove the ‚Äúadd as friend‚Äù icon in the profile immediately after sending the request?  Or at least change it to "considered" any.  And then for the second time I think that Habr has swallowed the request, and I try to resend (receiving Kolbaskin) - I think I am not the only one. <br><br>  17.T.k.  complaints are often heard that ‚ÄúHabr was not the one‚Äù because of the numerous articles on non-IT topics, I suggest: to break Habr into Two major sections ‚ÄúIT‚Äù and ‚Äúabout IT‚Äù :) and add to posts along with the vote ‚Äúlike / dislike ¬ªOne more vote - for compliance with the subject of the resource.  If a post is deemed not to be relevant (for example, it collects more than 20 corresponding points) it will be automatically transferred to some section ‚Äúfor IT posts‚Äù, but not deleted or deleted.  After all, just a joke can be interesting, but not relevant topic.  Accordingly, the tape and the new show separately for each block.  Or highlight a different color (even gray). <br><br>  18. Make a filter for those who have ‚ÄúHabr is not the same‚Äù - show only those posts that plus X put my friends from 1 circle.  I suppose that friends are chosen with similar interests and opinions on public life ‚Äî accordingly, a selection of reading materials can be trusted to them. <br><br>  19. Put a box next to the post author‚Äôs name to send express messages, for example, about errors in the text. <br><br>  20. It would be nice to somehow report new comments to blogs added by the user to your favorites. <br><br>  21. It is necessary, as one of the stages of registration, to point out the need to pass some kind of literacy test (for example, in the <a href="http://www.rg.ru/test">WG</a> ). <br><br>  22. Add the function of displaying the number of letters / number of extra letters to the form of adding a link (since the limit was set to 500) - until I thought of anything smarter than stupidly erase a few words or use a third-party program that has such a function. <br><br>  23. I repeat, but let it be in one place.  It would be nice to prohibit (technically) changing karma for those who do not have a single post and comment - agree, suspiciously, when a person has just registered - he hasn‚Äôt written anything yet, and already karma and strength 2 or even 6 with an empty profile. <br>  PS This is not from envy - it's just probably worth putting everyone in the same framework (and it will help from virtuals).  Since you are demanding and asking for interesting posts and comments from some for karma, then do not allow others to receive it only through an acquaintance. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/26238/">https://habr.com/ru/post/26238/</a></p>
