      My name is Alexander and my friends and I are promoting, as we can, <a href="http://ru.mobicreators.com/">mobile technologies in Kazakhstan</a> . <br>  We have hardly a dozen developers for iOS and Android, so we decided to tell our colleagues about our experience and stuffed cones here.  Actually, I want to talk about our experience in developing applications for myself. <br><br>  As it often happens, having created a couple of applications to order, we began to visit the thoughts about our own product.  And so, when we finally decided to do it, our <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/hpodcasts/112622" title="Podcast with this person">main developer</a> (I can't keep silent - from Ubisoft itself!) Was impatient to leave for the USA for a month. <br><br>  Realizing that there was exactly one week left before separation and we still don‚Äôt have time to do anything complicated, a simple, and, at first glance, realizable, idea came to mind. <img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/da964eba/945c506d/c8a47ffa/09af0bc4.jpg">  The idea: a digital clock, where a variety of people show what time it is.  Without thinking, we called this application <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/humanclock/id437528591%3Fmt%3D8%26ls%3D1" title="App on the App Store">HumanClock</a> . <br><br>  I‚Äôll say right away that nothing happened during the day, of course, but we did it in a week! <br><br>  <i>Under the cut a lot of photos from the process!</i> <br><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Coincidentally, our friend, photographer and person of art Alexei Demidov, always sought to technology.  We, harsh engineers and technologists, on the contrary, always wanted to touch something beautiful.  It is no exaggeration to say that Apple is what ultimately united us. <br><br>  Below - about the symbiosis of different people and the results of this process with pictures (long live synergy!). <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/23f6fcae/7363f624/404d554f/4a84e9f8.jpg"><br><br>  This, mentioned above, our photographer Alexey before shooting.  You can look at his hands endlessly. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/811b96db/9eecdbca/951dbce2/1273f363.jpg"><br><br>  We called friends and acquaintances as models.  Almost everyone agreed and came, although they did not really understand why. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/c2e7a72b/bd23a141/b170931f/98430221.jpg"><br><br>  From the beginnings of the idea to the photo shoot, 2 days passed and everything was ‚Äútuned‚Äù on the go, by trial and error.  At first they tried to shoot several people at the same time, but then they decided to stop at a separate shooting. <br><br>  The image from the camera, thanks to the software from Hasselblad instantly transmitted to all devices connected to WiFi. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/eb23eaac/56c499d9/cd9e4981/2da8d752.jpg"><br><br>  From each person we chose one image.  The exception is Maria.  She was with us from the beginning to the end of filming.  As a gift, she has two pictures: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/32d10c57/6ca94a39/bd2f242c/6210f05c.jpg"><br><br>  In order to make the models easier to convey emotions, we pumped up comics with fffuuu.ru.  Well, they also helped with their faces :) <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/664a330f/a71520df/c8cfb7ad/34ec50a9.jpg"><br><br>  Since the numbers are superimposed programmatically, we tried to set a piece of paper at a strictly defined level.  Then, however, they understood that this is fundamentally wrong (people have different height) and it was necessary to measure them from the top :) <br><br>  But with hindsight, as they say ... <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/85f27c28/fd774e3a/e96d7aee/e2c58f7f.jpg"><br><br>  The icon was developed right there. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/cc76b526/e70af3a1/2d70ff16/bc786d14.jpg"><br><br>  Playing with the location of people, we decided to make 2 plans: in the front - ‚Äúclear‚Äù people with ‚Äúclear‚Äù numbers, in the back - everything is blurry and slightly discolored. <br>  This gave the picture a certain depth. <br><br>  The change algorithm is simple: every 12 seconds, 1 person changes.  Every minute everyone is shuffled. <br>  The choice is random.  We did not even block the doubles that occasionally fall out - there is something in them ... <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/ba3f89dc/9cf61ce8/e0185363/c8264f5e.jpg"><br><br>  Also, for testing, we set up switching people by touching or shaking the device - as a result, it remained in the final version. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/791f3f1d/0931a2a2/2e7257c0/34d25ae1.jpg"><br><br>  In general, a week later, for one interesting watch in the world has become more. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/33a82501/eaf05a94/28dcc24d/fa5437ba.jpg"><br><br>  And this photoframe + watch is absolutely for fans :) <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/c25c9ff5/e959a6b8/aa0d95ae/c390d176.jpg"><br><br>  We really wanted to meet the 20 MB (limit for downloading via 3G networks) and, unfortunately, a lot of wonderful photos had to be rejected. <br><br>  As a result, the application was conceived just for fun, it turned out so funny that we decided to try to sell it for $ 0.99.  There is little practical use in it, but aesthetics is full :) <br><br>  And, in about a month, we want to release a free update: screw a couple of chips + add packages of new faces to thank the loyal users of our work. <br><br>  Actually, that's the <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/humanclock/id437528591%3Fmt%3D8%26ls%3D1" title="App on the App Store">app</a> itself <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/humanclock/id437528591%3Fmt%3D8%26ls%3D1" title="App on the App Store">in the App Store</a> . <br><br>  Thanks to everyone who read to the end!  Hello to you from Kazakhstan! <br><br>  Come to us, go to the mountains and eat kebabs :) <br><br>  PS A little cutting lastly: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/a1bbd64d/65e048f5/4c296de0/a30964d4.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/684f6e9d/41b9477e/181692a5/d7f8863e.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/8332cbc0/eb950635/84971a2e/780cce37.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/474257ba/2490e513/cf701430/7c7145e4.jpg"></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/120001/">https://habr.com/ru/post/120001/</a></p>
