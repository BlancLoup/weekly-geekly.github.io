  <section class="page js-page"><h1>7 little things raising sales in our online store</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Let's talk about <b>social proof</b> - the most powerful force that promotes sales.  And how to use it on the site and in other places.  I'll explain now. <br><br><h4>  Method 1. Photos of users with the goods </h4><br>  The cat "out of the box" can not get off the tree.  The rise in the hardcode reflexes, and the descent is not there.  He is not vital.  And she does not know how to go down - of course, until she sees how the other cat does it.  It is necessary once to understand the principle of an example, and she can repeat it herself.  Behavior mirroring is one of the most profound learning models, so it‚Äôs just a sin not to use it. <br><br>  Advice - for example, show your product in a natural setting with the people who use it.  Here's how we do it: 
      <br>
        <script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>
        <ins class="adsbygoogle"
          style="display:block; text-align:center;"
          data-ad-layout="in-article"

    <img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/dd0/b9a/ef3/dd0b9aef31465b96f5a89fb3d404d198.jpg"><br><br>  Over 5 years of work, we have formed a fairly large archive of photos of a desktop with games.  We used them.  You can do almost the same thing.  Yes!  There is a nuance.  If your customers are children, never put photos with younger ‚Äúusers‚Äù: much better - older ones.  It's simple.  The child wants to be like elders and absolutely does not want - to "kids." <a name="habracut"></a><br><br><h4>  2. Reviews </h4><br>  The meaning of the response - the very social proof.  If the product has a review about what features it has, how best to use and so on - this is very cool.  Lively dialogue around the product also helps. <br><br>  So, you must have accurate feedback on the product in the comments.  Therefore, you need to work with them as follows: <br><ul><li>  Send a letter after the order, in which you directly ask for feedback on the product.  This will help collect relevant data from the buyers themselves.  But in any case, do not try to bribe people in the spirit of "discount for a review" or something similar.  You need realistic data. </li><li>  If the question is repeated twice - try to answer it in the description of the product. </li><li>  Sew reviews on your social networks - after all, there is nothing better that proves the quality of the product. </li></ul><br>  In real stores, we also have reviews - they are at the checkout.  Records are sometimes somewhat strange: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/ffa/de0/517/ffade0517ed3bbd7edfdb80d33b81e68.jpg"><br><br>  If you still do not keep such books - it is worth starting.  Some buyers like to just draw there. <br><br><h4>  3. Collections of goods </h4><br>  Seasonal collections work very well as social proof.  We post them directly on the menu above: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/0d0/cb8/598/0d0cb8598560404dc187880e219ab1eb.png"><br><br>  You wonder what was there, huh? <br><br><h4>  4. Signature in the letter </h4><br>  Here is one of the mailing segments for example.  Pay attention to the number of clicks in the body and the number of clicks in the signature.  The signature is read with almost the same interest as the main text. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/372/a4b/ca6/372a4bca65d57e33f7ba3af6c2941950.png"><br><br>  If you still have unsigned letters, put at least a link to your bestsellers.  This is also a part of social proof - if there are ‚Äúbest selling games‚Äù below, then it will be interesting for many to see what really diverges the most. <br><br><h4>  5. Secret words </h4><br>  The effectiveness of advertising channels is quite difficult to measure.  A good marker is the secret word.  For example, I know that habrovchane bought board games in one new year for a couple of days for 300 thousand rubles, taking advantage of our discount. <br><br>  The second example is that we hung ads in elevators and made our word for each district.  As a result, we learned that a) we do not need advertising in elevators;  b) in which area live more of our potential buyers. <br><br>  The secret word is the easiest way to give a discount to people, and a good marker of how many people actually came and ordered.  And your customers just love to share these words: after all, it's really great to help others get a discount.  And here social proof again develops - a friend teaches you to buy in the store and gives a small incentive to do so. <br><br><h4>  6. Return immediately </h4><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/9d7/ac3/d7f/9d7ac3d7f1de7f484feb4fb59e2f6267.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Last year, we began experimenting massively with such tablets.  In general, a clear indication of the possibility of returning due to ‚Äúthe game did not fit the wallpaper‚Äù does not particularly provoke an increase in returns (although not without it, of course), but it gives confidence.  If it is not clear - you can take and understand at home, and not in the store.  This works especially well before the holidays, when people are afraid to ask questions under pressure from the queue. <br><br>  By the way, returns of consumer goods with a number of exceptions are possible according to current regulations, but very few of us use it.  At least the case "buy, see, do not like it - bring it back" does not work.  Perhaps this is also due to the fact that many stores are trying to complicate the return procedure.  We have enough to fill one piece of paper at the checkout - and if this is not a refund on the day of purchase, it is not even necessary to keep a check. <br><br><h4>  7. Discount your </h4><br>  It is very important to give a discount to your sellers - but the same one that a regular buyer can count on.  For example, our maximum retail discount is 10%.  That is the discount the seller has.  There is an important point about why no one else can, not even the director.  There are three reasons: an understanding of the value of the goods, insurance against abuse and the adequacy of pricing.  If you give someone a 20% discount with a maximum retail of 10%, this will immediately create a situation: ‚ÄúAha, it means they can easily throw off another 10%!  But they didn‚Äôt get rid of me! ‚Äù <br><br>  And we are friends with IT-companies.  For example, showing passes in Yandex, SAP, MS, and a bunch of companies immediately leads to the same 10% discount for their own.  Eichary is well aware of this feature - and they often ask us for a discount for their employees too.  Skip instead of a discount card.  <abbr title="By the way, if you need to - write me in a personal or on info@mosigra.ru.">Of course, we do</abbr> . <br><br>  One more thing.  Normal people put on key goods for holidays without discounts, assuming that they will be bought anyway.  We specifically select hits and put them in the games of the week.  For example, on the Cosmonautics Day there were ‚ÄúSpace truckers‚Äù.  The logic may seem a bit strange at first glance, but it works. <br><br><h4>  A little more finally </h4><br>  Know carts in supermarkets?  They are good for the owner of the store because the buyer is not limited to the bag - and therefore is able to buy much more than usual.  So, to go with them once seemed like a really stupid idea.  They put the carts, hung an ad, but nobody took them.  Then the store owner hired students who grabbed a cart, slowly walked with her around the supermarket, loaded products there ‚Äî and then, after the hour-long show, left for the warehouse.  And they went to a new circle.  Buyers saw that people nearby were using these strange things - and gradually began to take carts themselves, having understood by example how convenient it was.  Two weeks later, ‚Äúteaching‚Äù students were no longer needed. <br><br>  So, I remember this example every time I think about social evidence. <br><br>  And the best example of a farewell phrase from our seller that I heard was: ‚ÄúWhen you come next time, look at that game, I think you will like it.‚Äù  It, like a beautiful recursive code, is deployed already in the buyer's head into a whole bunch of incentives. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/219351/">https://habr.com/ru/post/219351/</a></p>
