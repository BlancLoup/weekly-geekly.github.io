  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Should I trust the information Seagate 7200.12? Bad experience</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  In the spring of this year I needed to buy a hard drive.  The choice fell on the model Seagate 7200.12, in the version of 500GB.  Single plate, thin, supporting all modern technologies (SATA-2, NCQ) and different, judging by the reviews, good speed and noise level.  The specific model that I got is ST3500410AS.  Everything would be fine, but the screw refused to work on my machine - AMD X2-4200 +, 2GB Ram, mother on the trimmed Nvidia-520LE chipset from Gigabyte, Nvidia 8800GT video and noname power supply on 450W.  The screw was formatted, but an attempt to record a large amount of information on it led to a dead hang of the entire system. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Having read through the forums, mostly English-speaking, I came across that this happens on machines overloaded with iron.  That is, it was logical that the cause of the problem is poor-quality food.  I rearranged the power supply to an honest 650W - the problem remained the same.  I wrote to the head tech support, but got a completely ‚Äúlogical‚Äù answer - check the disk surface with a proprietary utility.  If I had not done this before and had not directly indicated it in my letter, then everything would have been clear.  And so ... Who cares about other people's problems?  Attempting to run the screw on another machine, with Intel's chipset, showed the best result, but nevertheless, the system hung tight when copying a 60GB file.  Judging by the testimony of SMART on the screw, there were a lot of relocates - there were no free ones left. <br>  Then it was time to upgrade and I changed the processor to Core2Quad 6600 and mother to Gigabyte EP43-S3L.  On this machine, the screw worked fine.  Fast, silent.  More than I was satisfied.  His glitches on the 520LE were somehow forgotten, and I was inclined to write them off for chipset circumcision.  Four months later, by the end of July, the screw was filled to the brim.  Without hesitation, I went to the store and bought another one the same, for a sum of about 2 thousand rubles.  True, this was already with the index ST3500418AS.  I put Ubuntu on it.  For about two months, the screw was clogged up with 200 gigs. Sometimes, while loading, Linuh started checking it, but somehow I didn‚Äôt pay attention to it.  Is it enough?  Maybe the system went wrong or something else.  And on Tuesday, October 6th, this screw just stopped working.  The engine did not spin, the BIOS of the motherboard did not see it.  Screw was dead, burying all the information on it.  Although she was not so important to tear her hair, but still it was not pleasant.  Passed under warranty. <br>  I don‚Äôt know if I‚Äôve been so ‚Äúlucky‚Äù, or really the series is bad.  Since 7200.11 it is clear that marriage was officially recognized there, and there is no particular bad about 7200.12 with a capacity of 500GB.  For myself, I concluded that I would buy something from the server versions of another manufacturer for the main system.  And two 7200.12 I will unite in raid, I will put on them Windu and only under toys. </div>
