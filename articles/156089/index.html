  <section class="page js-page"><h1>IPhone for the slogan</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  It's no secret that zeal is determined by encouragement.  The corporate portal is an ideal tool for holding various kinds of contests among employees.  Especially - if as a result the employer is interested. <br><br>  The incident took place in the editorial office of the notorious newspaper ‚ÄúBusiness Petersburg‚Äù no further than last year.  Let me remind you that the year 2011 was marked by the peak of the popularity of gadgets with a bitten apple from Steve Jobs.  For this or for some other reason, but it was he who was appointed the prize - a welcome and so alluring iPhone 4s. <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  The essence of the competition is simple and urgent - the leading business publication of the city needed a new slogan.  A large-scale advertising campaign was planned and the injection of fresh ideas was simply not bypassing.  And one morning, sleepy journalists and, as always, active specialists of the advertising and distribution departments, having downloaded work computers, saw a bright announcement on the corporate portal - a competition is announced, the last (at that time) model is at stake IPhone!

      The fountain of ideas beat for several days, without actually drying up!  The proposed options were estimated at almost hundreds.  Each employee considered it his duty to make one or even several slogans.  They asked for advice from friends and colleagues, joked that in case of victory they would certainly give a call from a new smartphone, or even take a picture.  Stir gained momentum. <br><br>  The competition lasted only a few days.  The best option was chosen by the board of directors and the chief editor.  Announcements of the results were looking forward to, the number of people "on the site" kept at a record high.  And here is a picture of the winner.  They became Dmitry Grozny, editor of the applications of the newspaper "DP".  Either because his slogan was really the most appropriate publication concept, or if the Swedish founders of Bonnier Business Press decided to mark one of the most loyal employees, but the fact remains.  The award found its winner.  Someone snorted with envy, but most shook Dmitri's hand and unsubscribed a huge amount of greetings on the internal website. <br><br>  Holding such competitions is useful for all groups of the public of a large organization.  Employees have the opportunity to join the corporate culture, their loyalty to the company increases significantly.  And the designers of the competition get an excellent result - who, if not their own employees, can most fully and succinctly reflect the essence of the concept of the newspaper. <br><br>  On May 23, 2011, the new slogan of the publication was ‚ÄúImportant questions, accurate answers‚Äù.  To them he remains to this day. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/156089/">https://habr.com/ru/post/156089/</a></p>
