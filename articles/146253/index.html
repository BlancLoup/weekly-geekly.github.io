During the winter holidays, the Internet traffic of your resource will indeed dramatically drop for a few days, because everyone is relaxing all at once, all over the world.  The situation with vacations is somewhat different: you can make sure that your customer base remains active in relation to your products and services even in summer. <br><br>  However, her specific behavior will indeed be somewhat adjusted with the onset of the holiday season.  We will talk about this. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  First, most of the clients will try to go somewhere - if not to Italy, then at least to the country.

      Here you can use two tricks at once - and this is the first thing that comes to mind: <br><br><ol><li>  Offer people a vacation. </li><li>  Offer people a share in which you can "on the road." </li></ol><br>  "Offer vacation" can be in the broadest sense of the word: you can both offer products that are most relevant on vacation, and spend a trip to a country.  Your humble servant could not resist the temptation to participate in the lottery of one of the online stores, where the main prize was a trip to Greece.  And let the opportunity to win this trip is very illusive, but, considering the days before the holiday in a boring office - why not dream? <br><br>  Promotions that you can tie to the holidays, can be very different.  Here you better make a choice based on the specifics of your project. <br><br>  Suppose you have a portal for young mothers who, with a high degree of probability, may go to the country with a child for a month or more.  Offer them a special promotion and promotion for ordering from a mobile device, sell this device to them in advance from the pages of your website and stimulate interest so that they stay in touch with you. <br><br>  It is possible that you will not be able to offer them the delivery of goods outside the city under normal conditions - offer special ones: this may be either special delivery or ‚Äúdelayed‚Äù - order now, and receive your order when you arrive. <br><br>  Finally, diversify your content as interestingly as possible so that in the summer hours of doing nothing on your site you can go for communication or useful information.  And of course, do not let the female visitors of your project to the country without a warm blanket as a gift or without buying insect repellent - all this is better to take with you, which means this is a reason for another mailing. <br><br>  The second important change in the behavioral activity of your customers - they will be away from the monitors.  Just 10 years ago, this could really bother you.  Now, with the spread of the mobile Internet, people are ‚Äúhooked up‚Äù to all the electronic benefits of civilization so deeply that even if 50% of your base left for the Amazonian forests, they would still continue to click on your mailings - unless, of course, you have taught.  However, just due to the fact that in the summer mobile Internet will be used more often, it is not bad to prepare for it in advance: <br><br><h2>  Do you have a mobile version of the site? </h2><br><ol><li>  How good is the mobile version of your site?  Is it light enough?  Have you tried to access your website from various devices and perform the actions that are most often performed by your customers?  Do you have it at all? </li><li>  Your newsletter should be as easy and simple as possible to display correctly on all types of mobile devices. </li></ol><br><h2>  Add a sentence that will not distract from the main goal - rest </h2><br>  Of course, taking into account that the sphere of interests in summer varies somewhat in principle: everyone wants to spend a weekend away from home and civilization, you need to prepare for a vacation ‚Äî perhaps save on ‚Äúunnecessary‚Äù purchases, or buy what you need for a vacation.  Take this into account when forming your future newsletter, add a proposal that will not distract from the main goal - rest.  And even better if this proposal contributed to a good rest. <br><br>  Finally, no one forbids you to hold the summer campaign ‚ÄúWhile everyone has left‚Äù, and to make your customers a tempting offer as part of this action.  And here it is not very important what you are selling: if it is clothes, offer swimsuits, if books, offer a book for the journey, guidebook or phrase book;  if with utensils, sell a picnic set.  Options can be many.  Help your clients beautifully arrange their summer vacation - this is one of the easiest ways to be useful, and therefore in demand. <br><br><h2>  You can always fill the summer break with interesting content, training videos, contests and ‚Äústories about summer‚Äù </h2><br>  Finally, even if your customers have gone so far that they cannot use the delivery service, or if they have spent so much during the holidays, that they cannot buy you from the same diligence for some time, still do not drop them and do not despair.  You can always fill this short pause with interesting content, training videos, contests and ‚Äústories about summer‚Äù.  All this is necessary in order to continue and maintain activity around your resource, reinforcing the habit of your clients to contact you on any relevant occasion. <br><br><h2>  In the holiday season, your base will not go anywhere. </h2><br>  Thus, our point of view is simple: during the holiday season your base will not go anywhere.  Few people go on vacation for the whole summer: the majority still remain at the monitors for days at a time and continue to ‚Äúblunt‚Äù in the mail and social networks, dreamily flipping through the pages of online stores.  So, your updates, subscriptions and blog remain as relevant as they were throughout the year. <br><br>  Even if the return on your mailings or site visits shrinks a little in the summer, keep reminding you: even if there was no response to your letter, you could see it.  So, you are constantly present in the field of view of your client: when he returns to ‚Äúnormal life‚Äù after a short vacation, he will be with you again, as if he did not go anywhere, because you have not left him all this time. <br><br><h5>  PS </h5>  Test the <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/unisender/blog/145740/">split testing</a> and other features of the UniSender service for free: <b>use the <a href="http://www.unisender.com/ru/testdrive/">test drive of our services</a></b> .
