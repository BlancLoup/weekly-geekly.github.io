  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Overview teXet TM-511R: a secure phone with a 2,700 mAh battery</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"> Perhaps the most vulnerable point of modern protected smartphones are touch screens.  Such devices can be drowned and felled in the sand without any special fears, but you should carefully drop them - and what if the screen falls down, and even on a pebble?  It is clear that dropping something neatly and at the same time accidentally almost impossible, such situations happen suddenly.  Straws are not hooked up beforehand, and a sandwich (in this case, its equivalent is a smartphone) most often falls with oil (touch screen) down. <br><br>  I remember that six months ago my friend and I made very serious tests on the <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/smartgadget/blog/201424/">teXet X-Driver</a> smartphone, and he managed to preserve honor and dignity.  But everything could have turned out differently: after each throw we were wary of looking at the screen - did it suddenly crack?  So, if you still need a protected device, but you don‚Äôt want to get involved with the ‚Äúsensory devices‚Äù, you should look towards off-road push-button phones.  Today we are talking about one of them - teXet TM-511R. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/ea8/90e/f80/ea890ef8093b391b2c3ed56befd127ab.jpg"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  <b>Brief specifications teXet TM-511R</b> : <br>  IP67 water and dust protection <br>  Two active SIM cards GSM / GPRS 850/900/1800/1900 Standard <br>  Display: 2 inches, TFT, 240 x 320 pix. <br>  Photo / video camera: 2.0 MP + flashlight flashlight <br>  Bluetooth <br>  FM radio: 87.5-108.0 MHz <br>  Expansion slot: microSD / SDHC (up to 16 GB) <br>  3.5 mm headphone jack <br>  micro usb <br>  Lithium-ion battery 2 700 mAh <br>  Dimensions: 128 x 60 x 22 mm <br>  Weight: 168 g

      <b>About autonomous work</b> <br><br>  Today there are a lot of similar models on the market, and from different brands.  What is the specific feature of teXet TM-511R?  Perhaps you have already paid attention to it in the list of TTX, but nevertheless I will emphasize again: this phone has a battery capacity of 2,700 mAh. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/1f3/5c7/471/1f35c7471cadafd3953224ebb3cf3fc4.jpg"><br><br>  That is just a little less than the Samsung Galaxy S5 (2,800 mAh) and slightly more than the Samsung Galaxy S4 (2,600 mAh).  As a person with a holiday, usually broken into three or four weeks off at different times of the year, it is difficult for me to understand why someone might need to sit somewhere for a month away from power outlets.  But the fact is that teXet TM-511R is quite ready for this.  After receiving the device, I charged it, and now the third week of work without recharging ends, and on the indicator another quarter of the charge.  I am sure the phone will reach the coveted month.  For comparison: most of these phones have a battery of 1 400-1 600 mAh. <br><br>  <b>About functionality</b> <br><br>  However, it should be understood that this autonomy was achieved largely due to the not very broad functionality of the phone.  Roughly speaking, he can make calls, provide messaging, play music / video and take photos, plus offers a voice recorder, alarm clock, calendar, organizer, currency converter, a couple of games and a very simple browser.  In short, there are all the possibilities of the simplest, "telephone" platform MediaTek.  In fact, you don‚Äôt see a movie on a 2-inch display, the browser allows you to open only the simplest sites (and you don‚Äôt often discover them using GPRS - EDGE is not supported), and the quality of music playback will suit only the most picky user.  However, for audiobooks teXet TM-511R is quite suitable.  Moreover, it has a 3.5 mm jack for headphones, and you can experiment by changing the complete headset to something more interesting.  This is important, since in the case of many push-button ‚Äúoff-road vehicles‚Äù their horrible complete headsets are connected to the miniUSB / microUSB ports and cannot be replaced. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/1dc/d61/74b/1dcd6174b976e0f44e73b73aa7cc36e2.jpg"><br>  <i>The interface of the phone looks like this.</i>  <i>The screen is very blind in the sun, so I had to take one photo at home</i> <br><br>  It's nice that, under the control of teXet, the device was well localized.  That is, there are no strange abbreviations, errors in the Russian language and other translation jambs in the interface.  I will never forget the <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/smartgadget/blog/190744/">Caterpillar CAT B25</a> : the screen unlocking scheme is incorrectly indicated in the pop-up hint plate when switching to Ukrainian.  Why, why, who is to blame for this - open questions.  So, teXet TM-511R has nothing like this, the device is localized to the top five. <br><br>  Separately, oddly enough, there is a camera.  Yes, you can't create a photocamera with its help.  But she shoots better than cameras that were installed in similar devices last year.  Moreover, teXet TM-511R is more or less suitable for shooting text.  This picture was taken in a poorly lit room - in good light everything is much better. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/265/17a/580/26517a580c49524f20be4159e79d09eb.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/604/772/e4f/604772e4ffa524d9357b7c5f5055e66e.jpg"><br><br>  The model has two slots for SIM-cards, their work is organized in the standard way: in the standby mode, both SIM cards are available, and during a conversation, the other one is turned off.  With a connection, everything in a bundle is well heard in both directions.  There is a very important point here: on teXet TM-511R, you can normally speak immediately after removing it from the water.  Yes, it will be heard a little worse than in a completely dry state, and yet - normal.  Often, the conversational dynamics of the protected devices after immersion in water fail for an hour or two - until they dry out. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/524/c8b/92d/524c8b92d50187b0256cbedead7409eb.jpg"><br><br>  <b>About package</b> <br><br>  A very simple headset, a USB-microUSB cable, a charging unit, a warranty, and a quick start guide is a basic set of almost any modern phone. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/23f/94a/81c/23f94a81c8f8829feeed551a598f8f06.jpg"><br><br>  Meanwhile, a pair of non-standard accessories is coming with teXet TM-511R.  The first one is a carabiner with an analog compass and a screwdriver plate needed to unscrew the back cover. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/b1a/d62/08e/b1ad6208e6283bed69266d62728f4721.jpg"><br><br>  The second is spare plugs for microUSB and 3.5 mm ports, and they come with small bolts.  What is all this for?  Well, over time, the caps attached to the phone at the factory can become frayed.  For example, if it is often dropped on the asphalt.  In this case, the ‚Äúspare wheel‚Äù is useful: you do not have to buy a new phone.  Again, I‚Äôll return to my personal Caterpillar CAT B25: if you damage a stub tightly bolted to its case, it will lose one of its main qualities - water resistance.  With teXet TM-511R, this number will not work, you can simply change the caps and operate it further. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/47e/d4e/09c/47ed4e09c9814e47f64a52a64cc3c50f.jpg"><br><br>  <b>About the body</b> <br><br>  Perhaps the main ‚Äúnear-case‚Äù feature of teXet TM-511R are matte metal plates screwed to the side faces.  They look nice and, not least, make the device ... more civil, or something.  Well, that is, I would not go to most SUV-like phones in the city, but teXet TM-511R is quite suitable for this.  It does not seem to be a "tractor" or, we will say so, as a kind of combat weapon.  Although, of course, the device is not at all small and not light - you can‚Äôt hand it over to an elegant lady. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/2b8/256/915/2b8256915d31a6b253a5234f33ccbeaf.jpg"><br><br>  At the same time, after our tests, the metal was slightly more scratches and dents than on rubber and plastic - these are two other materials used in the teXet TM-511R case.  So the use of metal plates can be called justified, and not very.  They have a positive effect on the design and a negative impact on scratch resistance.  However, the scars - they after all decorate the real men, and teXet TM-511R - this is just a kind of man's telephone. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/bce/c28/742/bcec2874280ba019f0d96981720a2ce9.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/c58/f10/835/c58f108350c732e81469183080e03ef6.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/2f5/c31/a12/2f5c31a1267cb699b5604beb37ffbef9.jpg"><br><br>  The build quality is very high; no gaps or unnecessary holes, which in theory could have passed sand and water inwards, were found.  But, of course, before diving it will be useful to press the port plugs with your finger one more time and check whether you screwed the back cover tightly.  She, I remind you, is attached with two steel bolts. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/493/aec/956/493aec95638c387e9da22f6a93fd8759.jpg"><br><br>  I would especially note the convenience of the keyboard and joystick.  In terms of clarity, they differ little from the keyboards of any Nokia Asha push-button phones.  For a secure machine, this is a real plus, because the developers of such models usually spit on ergonomics from a high mountain. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/70f/8cc/d82/70f8ccd827798e8a5a4030c1ae6fd933.jpg"><br><br>  <b>About security</b> <br><br>  The teXet TM-511R case conforms to the IP67 standard, that is, the phone can be submerged for half an hour under water to a depth of one meter.  Plus he is not afraid of dust.  With blows it is more difficult: teXet does not declare compliance with one of the standards of the MIL-STD-810 family, which, in contrast to IP, also implies impact resistance.  Nevertheless, the case of the apparatus of metal, rubber and durable plastic hints that it can also be dropped. <br><br>  To begin with, we lowered the apparatus into the river.  40 minutes, he lay there in various poses. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/59e/c86/c5c/59ec86c5cd8da1c1dcc1df6df37f21ff.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/e6e/2d3/c7c/e6e2d3c7c31b09cbdd6884c892b99976.jpg"><br><br>  This was followed by an hour "twist" in a jar of pickles.  Everything is also OK. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/50b/0ce/49a/50b0ce49a03004ae9e874a237a523d71.jpg"><br><br>  They kicked him on the beach.  There are a couple of scratches, yet the shells are relatively sharp, and this was to be expected.  But the performance of "football" had no effect. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/0a0/a55/0f7/0a0a550f7bccb6f7136fb586539c73c2.jpg"><br><br>  We also tied the phone to the Parrot Ar.Drone 2.0 quadcopter and threw it from a height of 10 meters onto the ground with gravel, drowned it in the bathroom and threw it on the asphalt.  Here is a video of such a fall: <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/ejIjH12wnCw%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700021,15700186,15700191,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhha1Pfk6cmIH6S_MSDH_YFfme2YNg" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  teXet TM-511R endured all these mockeries, no problems were fixed.  Well, except that the SIM-card has moved in the slot, which led to a loss of communication with the cellular network, - and this is only because the slot has the miniSIM format, and I inserted my ‚Äúmicrosyme‚Äù there. <br><br>  <b>Total</b> <br><br>  teXet TM-511R, I will not be afraid of this word, head and shoulders above analogs - at least those 5-6 button "off-road" devices that I have encountered.  By security, they are all about the same, but in this case some attention is paid to the ‚Äútrifles‚Äù: the camera (those who disagree can look <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/smartgadget/blog/190744/">in here</a> and admire the pictures made by the phone under the CAT brand), the plugs in the kit, the location and, most importantly, the battery capacity.  The same Caterpillar CAT B25 is about the same in size, it is no less, and the battery is almost twice as weak.  And it costs, what is most funny, more expensive: about 5,000 rubles versus 2,900 in the case of the Texet. <br><br>  In general, lovers of teXet TM-511R long mountain or sea adventures can be recommended.  Especially if you are taking something more ‚Äúinternet‚Äù on vacation (a smartphone there or a tablet) - everything is very difficult with the World Wide Web for devices like teXet TM-511R.  However, a break from this very Web is also useful. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/226743/">https://habr.com/ru/post/226743/</a></p>
