Somehow we have already written about the compact headset of the Jabra company.  Then we really liked it and after a short break, we took another interesting product for testing - <a href="http://www.icover.ru/catalog/product/jabra_vega_100_55810000_60_provodnaya_garnitura_black/">Jabra Vega</a> .  So, in essence, this is a full-size headphones with active noise cancellation.  We will try to tell you about them in detail. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/dac/4fe/53a/dac4fe53a7d341f79b94251013ee7d48.png"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  <a href="http://www.icover.ru/brands/jabra/">Jabra</a> has been in the audio market for a long time.  With their products, as a rule, inspires confidence and confirms the high level of production of gadgets.  An attempt to create your own <a href="http://www.icover.ru/catalog/category/provodnye_garnitury/">headset</a> with active noise cancellation is far from the first.  The first experience was back in 2007 - Jabra C820s.  It was then that the headset gave a certain distinctive feature, what distinguished it from a number of similar devices.  It turned out quite well.  Well, since development is the engine of progress, then after 9 years it will be curious to find out what is available to modern users today.

    <h2>  <font color="¬´#6aa400¬ª">Appearance and design construct</font> </h2><br><br>  As you know, the appearance begins with the presentation of the goods.  In the case when the product is purchased by the buyer - this is a box.  Large, bright and very informative - the combination of yellow with dark graphic drawings looks presentable.  Open the box itself. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/9a8/a86/81c/9a8a8681cf114726ae463ba5ff44b3c0.jpg"><br><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Big photo</b> <div class="spoiler_text"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/daa/6e8/3a0/daa6e83a05cf4fdd8039f6a557eb7765.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/544/f23/89f/544f2389fe9d466a8d50460c41c93885.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/d08/e09/247/d08e092475484331b01bcd7491cd790e.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/cbd/48b/559/cbd48b55966340e09670c81ec3e0d280.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/082/694/df1/082694df1870451f8b641e78128f379a.jpg"><br></div></div><br><br>  In addition to the headphones themselves, the box contains a case for them, a cable, an adapter for use on the plane, and documentation.  The kit is quite standard for off- <a href="http://www.icover.ru/catalog/category/headphones/filter/price-base-from-5000/apply/">budget headphones</a> in its price range.  I note that the headset is packed securely.  From all sides it protects the dark foam. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/0e6/655/e07/0e6655e070e3445986c5888d324ef599.jpg"><br><br>  And what is the Jabra Vega headset itself?  As I said, in fact, this is a <a href="http://www.icover.ru/catalog/category/polnorazmernye_naushniki/">full-size headphones</a> .  It is always difficult to tell about the design of such things - you have to take into account the "taste" differences between different people.  Let's just say, it is very difficult to come up with something new in the appearance of the headphones.  However, subjectively, I liked this stereo headset.  It is beautiful and made with high quality.  The successful combination of materials in the form of metal, rubberized plastic and eco-leather.  Feels almost no less natural.  Tactile pleasant, and most likely wear-resistant.  And in which case - ear pads are easy to remove and replace with new ones.  Inside, an orange audio cloth covers the speakers.  The sides are signed on it - the left earpiece or the right one. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/b57/963/215/b579632156c346cdbaf9205212ce8414.png"><br><br>  Thanks to the metal, the design of the headphones is not only durable, but also weighty - 278 grams.  There is a certain sense of monumentality of the whole structure and that pleases, it does not affect the comfort of use.  The weight of the headphones and ear cushions do not put pressure on the head, they sit comfortably enough.  You can easily spend in them almost all day without experiencing any discomfort.  In winter, under the cap, these headphones, of course, can not be hidden.  Height adjustment is quite extensive - suitable for owners of heads of any size. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/15c/682/953/15c682953115406ebfeeeed4b25f5425.png"><br><br>  There are no complaints about the build quality.  Here, nothing creaks, does not falter, and no defects of eco-leather were noticed.  The bundled cable has a bright orange fabric sheath and is practically not tangled in your pocket.  And the remote control that is located on it is also made of metal. <br><br><h2>  <font color="¬´#6aa400¬ª">About features and details</font> </h2><br><br>  First of all, it should be noted the presence of an active noise cancellation system, which consists of four microphones.  Their main function is to filter out the noise around you ... Importantly, the system really works well.  Of course, it is not possible to completely get rid of extraneous noise in audio products for mass use.  However, to drown out the voices in the room, a loud TV in the room or the sounds of a noisy street is quite real.  The magic key of the quiet mode is on the right, in the form of a slider with two positions.  There is a LED indicator of the system operation.  It is located on the key itself and is colored orange.  Looks neat and unobtrusive. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/b4e/7f9/9d4/b4e7f99d4c914cbc8c064e637473cd2f.jpg"><br><br>  From the outside, the left plastic plug is removed and under it you can find a compartment for a conventional AAA battery.  On the cover is also present the designation of the headphone model and the requirements for the battery.  According to the manufacturer of the battery from 1.5;  1,000 mA active noise canceling headphones will last up to 35 hours.  Of course, you can use rechargeable batteries, batteries.  In other cases, the noise cancellation will remain passive, but the headphones will still work quietly. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/0e1/7aa/c32/0e17aac32f89411c87647c3240840726.jpg"><br><br>  Not to mention the possibility of quickly turning off the sound with an activated ‚Äúnoise reduction‚Äù system - this happens with one click on the key, which is located exactly in the center of the plastic-rubber part of the cup.  It is a pity that in the case of the use of passive noise reduction, you can not turn off the sound with one click - it would be a convenient addition to the general functionality.  A key is pressed with an audible click, and its turn is small. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/1aa/4e6/b89/1aa4e6b894e142d79e0f970245ab5466.jpg"><br><br>  Another interesting solution was the placement of two AUX connectors at once, one per cup.  Both, respectively, below.  It is extremely convenient and at the same time is not as often as we would like. <br><br>  Note the presence of its own application Jabra with support for Dolby technology for mobile devices.  Moreover, to use the application after installation, you will need to enter a special security code, which can be found on a separate form, complete with instructions for use.  On it you can use the QR code to go to the store for download.  The application is a thoughtful player with its own equalizer and sound ‚Äúpresets‚Äù for headphones.  Also supported the creation of your own.  The advantages should include omnivorous, is unlikely to find an audio format that he would not be able to. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/04b/6a7/42b/04b6a742b12f4d7390b784c38466a139.jpg"><br><br><h2>  <font color="¬´#6aa400¬ª">It seems it's time to talk about the sound?</font> </h2><br><br>  Subjectively, I liked the way Jabra Vega plays, at least in direct comparison with my <a href="http://www.icover.ru/catalog/product/sony_mdr_1rnc_polnorazmernye_naushniki_black/">Sony MDR-1R</a> home headphones.  Listening was done with the smartphone <a href="http://www.icover.ru/catalog/product/smartfon_htc_one_m8_dual_sim_silver/">HTC One M8</a> and a laptop with an external sound card <a href="http://www.icover.ru/catalog/product/asus_xonar_u3_usilitel_dlya_naushnikov_black/">Asus Xonar U3</a> . <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/abd/537/fe5/abd537fe50fe4a62baf72879ac205817.jpg"><br><br>  I would like to note a sensitive reaction to the quality of the sound being played, the difference between hearing in high and medium quality is dramatic.  It is very pleasant to listen to vocals in such headphones.  Medium and high frequencies are well felt.  Low, too expressive, but not sure that the headset is ideal for playing electronic music. <br><br>  Since these are not just headphones, and there is a compact remote control with a microphone on the wire, it is worth mentioning the quality of voice transmission.  The interlocutor heard me well, without unpleasant interference and irritable distortion.  The timbre of the voice was legible.  Consequently, a complete microphone located on the wire is quite suitable for everyday use.  The overall rating for the sound of the Jabra Vega is definitely 9 out of 10. In the wishes, we‚Äôll leave for low frequencies to play more volumetric and expressive. <br><br><h2>  <font color="¬´#6aa400¬ª">In custody</font> </h2><br><br>  Model <a href="http://www.icover.ru/catalog/product/jabra_vega_100_55810000_60_provodnaya_garnitura_black/"><b>Jabra Vega has been</b></a> sold in Russia for more than six months.  Yes, the company has turned out to be far from the most budgetary product in comparison with other <a href="http://www.icover.ru/catalog/category/nakladnye/filter/p_connection-is-%25D0%25BF%25D1%2580%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B2%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B4%25D0%25BD%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B5/apply/">wired headphones with a headset</a> , and in stores it is sold at a corresponding price of about 11 thousand rubles. <br><br>  Is it worth the money?  From my point of view, yes.  I did not manage to reveal any obvious minuses for the entire testing period, which lasted more than a week of daily operation.  Rubberized plastic is quite soiled and there are traces of hands on it, but in principle they are easily removed with a soft, dry cloth.  You can find fault with eco-leather, but does it make sense?  In fact, the workmanship even exceeds expectations.  Playing headphones in comparison with other <a href="http://www.icover.ru/catalog/category/polnorazmernye_naushniki/">full-size</a> and <a href="http://www.icover.ru/catalog/category/nakladnye/">overhead</a> , very good.  This level of sound will suit many average users, and people who understand the sound will surely make a positive opinion about the product. <br><br>  According to the rules, the pros and cons of the device should be indicated, but, constructively, the <b>Jabra Vega</b> is an excellent product.  A small minus is present as power for noise reduction.  The manufacturer apparently decided to use batteries, not a built-in battery with charging via a Micro USB cable. <br><br>  Other iCover articles and events <br><br><ul><li>  <a href="http://www.icover.ru/promo/gator-caref-watch-zabota-o-vashem-rebenke/">Gator Caref Watch.</a>  <a href="http://www.icover.ru/promo/gator-caref-watch-zabota-o-vashem-rebenke/">Caring for your child</a> </li><li>  <a href="http://www.icover.ru/promo/skidki-ot-kitchenaid/">Spring discounts from KitchenAid</a> </li><li>  <a href="http://www.icover.ru/sale/">Sale of useful gadgets and interesting pieces</a> </li><li>  <a href="http://www.icover.ru/blog/article/logitech-rasshiryaet-lineyku-mekhanicheskikh-igrovykh-klaviatur-s-tsvetnoy-podsvetkoy/">Logitech Expands Color-Illuminated Mechanical Gaming Keyboards</a> </li><li>  <a href="http://www.icover.ru/blog/article/vybor-umnykh-chasov-segodnya-chto-izmenilos/">A selection of smart watches today.</a>  <a href="http://www.icover.ru/blog/article/vybor-umnykh-chasov-segodnya-chto-izmenilos/">What changed?</a> </li><li>  <a href="http://www.icover.ru/blog/article/idealnyy-gadzhetoryukzak-dlya-ottsa-semeystva/">Perfect gadget backpack for father family</a> </li><li>  <a href="http://www.icover.ru/blog/article/kak-chekhol-ne-spas-moy-iphone-vybiray-pravilno/">How the case did not save my iPhone.</a>  <a href="http://www.icover.ru/blog/article/kak-chekhol-ne-spas-moy-iphone-vybiray-pravilno/">Choose right</a> </li></ul></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/391583/">https://habr.com/ru/post/391583/</a></p>
