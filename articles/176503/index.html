How many of them?  Five?  Ten?  But what about the other 365 days?  This is the ‚Äúlong tail‚Äù that makes up our lives.  Every day should be full of events and bring us happiness. ‚Äù </blockquote><br>  Anna Vetrinskaya, gene.  director of adventum <br><br><h4>  A long tail </h4><br>  Using Yandex search, we find a high-quality response to high-frequency requests for ‚Äúrent an apartment‚Äù, ‚Äúbuy a laptop‚Äù.  But we are changing and becoming more demanding, we are no longer satisfied with just an apartment.  I want to "Rent an apartment with a pink sofa", will Yandex help me with this?  How many pages will I have to scroll through to find the answer? <br><br>  The interests of users are moving away from high-frequency requests in favor of low-frequency ones.  This trend is observed in many areas (see the book ‚ÄúThe Long Tail‚Äù by Chris Anderson).

Moreover, the more accurate the low-frequency request, the higher the conversion and the lower the competition. <br><br>  Who appreciated this trend and uses it for a long time? <br><br><h4>  Doorway </h4><br>  Issuing Yandex on commercial low-frequency queries is a list of doorways.  Let me give you the same example as a year ago, the request ‚Äú <a href="http://yandex.ru/yandsearch%3Flr%3D213%26text%3D%25D1%2581%25D0%25B1%25D0%25B5%25D1%2580%25D0%25B1%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BD%25D0%25BA%2B%25D1%2581%25D1%2583%25D1%2580%25D0%25B3%25D1%2583%25D1%2582%2B%25D0%25BF%25D0%25BE%25D1%2582%25D1%2580%25D0%25B5%25D0%25B1%25D0%25B8%25D1%2582%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BB%25D1%258C%25D1%2581%25D0%25BA%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B9%2B%25D0%25BA%25D1%2580%25D0%25B5%25D0%25B4%25D0%25B8%25D1%2582">Sberbank Surgut consumer credit</a> ‚Äù - the situation has not changed.  This request is in the base of low-frequency credit requests from doorway vendors. <br>  We can now compile a list of these doorways and send them to Yandex, they will be banned during the week (verified).  But this situation does not change.  A week later, Yandex will index a new batch of doorways. <br>  Today the market of doorways is not 10 students.  Behind the wheel are large companies, sometimes they are owners, employees of partner systems.  Doorways use efficient landing pages with good conversion. <br>  Due to the constant introduction of new sites, dorostroi have the ability to analyze and create more effective pages.  And they will develop further until the price of creating a dora is higher than the profit from it. <br><br><h4>  What to do? </h4><br>  <b>Push doorway out of issue</b> <br>  Why on low-frequency commercial requests are not issued quality sites?  Because for quality sites there are ‚Äú <a href="http://help.yandex.ru/webmaster/%3Fid%3D995342">Rules</a> ‚Äù.  They can not do what is allowed doorways. <br>  Example.  The company collected bank tariffs on loans, broke them down by its presence in the cities of Russia.  Made a catalog of tariffs for cities.  So  for the request ‚Äúconsumer credit in the city of N‚Äù this site gives a qualitative answer.  But Plato imposes sanctions on such a site, and it is not in issue. <br>  The actions of "Plato" are subjective, it would seem, he is fighting for the quality of the sites, but sometimes clears the way for doorways. <br><br>  <b>Ban all "affiliate"</b> <br>  The easiest method to burn everything on the vine.  No affiliate - no doorway.  But then there will not be a number of "good sites".  The market will become boring and monopolized, and the common man will find it harder to succeed.  Road builders will go to social networks and other sources of traffic. <br>  In affiliate programs there is an obvious minus - they contribute to the development of high-value, and sometimes they themselves take part in it.  Blocking for work with affiliates encouraging the development of doorways is a possible way out. <br>  On the other hand, the affiliate program is convenient.  I myself worked directly with banks, there are a lot of difficulties here, ranging from workflow to reports, those.  problems, disputes and delays in payment.  Affiliate programs let you think about the development of the project, and not about the routine. <br><br>  <b>Create blacklist doorway pages</b> <br>  I talked with representatives of large commercial sites, and they are ready to pay for even manual work on blocking doorways.  If you manually collect lists of doorways and send them to Yandex, the average lifespan of such sites will fall to 2 weeks.  The feasibility of creating a new question.  The large resources will receive an inflow of traffic of 10k per cent, depending on the subject of spamming. <br>  Another option would be to create a blacklist similar to those created against mail spam.  But there are some difficulties in coordinating work with search engines and resolving disputes. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/176503/">https://habr.com/ru/post/176503/</a></p>
