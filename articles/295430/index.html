  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Lifehacking in crowdfunding</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Today, attracting investment to the project through crowdfunding platforms has become a working practice.  People are ready to support the project with a worthwhile idea that solves existing problems.  But what principles should be followed when drafting a project? <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/712/631/02a/71263102a5ce45a1be8e8cae4109391e.png" alt="image"><br><br>  Recently, I participated in the launch of a project at one of the crowdfunding sites.  We approached the launch of the project very seriously: we studied all the sites related to crowdfunding, promotion and correct design of articles.  And I would like to share some of the experiences that we have accumulated during the preparation, in the form of several life hacks. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  1. <b>First contact.</b>  Do not neglect communication with the curator of your project.  At all crowdfunding sites after you create a project (draft), a curator is assigned to you.  It is very important to know all the details of the specifics of the description and design of the project on this site even before the start of its design and preparation of the material (photos and videos).  Immediately learn about project evaluation criteria for approval.  This will save you from rewriting the entire contents of the project after sending it for moderation. <br>  Also, if your curator says that it would be desirable to add additional pictures or link a page on a social network - do it without hesitation!  Indeed, hundreds of projects pass through the hands of curators, and they know their weaknesses better.

It would seem that this does not affect much on sponsorship, but you are mistaken!  If you simplify the crowd-site model: the sponsor buys the product he likes (the reward), therefore, the success of the fees will depend on the design of the price tags. <br>  In short, make the price of a type of 999 rubles (starting from 99).  Not a single study has been conducted proving the ‚Äúbewitching‚Äù power of nines.  For a detailed study of the <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%259F%25D1%2581%25D0%25B8%25D1%2585%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BB%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B3%25D0%25B8%25D1%2587%25D0%25B5%25D1%2581%25D0%25BA%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B5_%25D1%2586%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BD%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B1%25D1%2580%25D0%25B0%25D0%25B7%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B2%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B5">link to Wikipedia</a> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/ea5/a58/916/ea5a589169264630aeb43389c27a34f7.png" alt="image"><br><br>  3. A <b>prominent cover.</b>  No, I do not mean that it should be colorful and well reflect the project itself.  Before you make a cover, you must go to the site of the site and find out 2 things, firstly, what is the background of the main page of the site, and secondly, look through the covers of all new projects and understand what tone prevails in them.  Based on this, you should choose the color scheme of your cover so that it is visible on the page and stands out among the others. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/fd8/65f/b73/fd865fb736304ddd9bab50e2ce237f48.png" alt="image"><br><br>  4. <b>Take an example.</b>  I am 90% sure that the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãyour project is not new and has something in common with something already existing.  And that's not bad.  While crowd funding in Russia is only growing in America and some other countries, this is already a serious tool.  Before you start your project, be sure to visit the most popular crowd sites in the world, for example, kickstarter.com, Indiegogo or RocketHub and find a project similar to yours (perhaps only by topic).  See how they present it, what rewards are offered, how the design is made, and also what the target audience looks like. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/524/d6e/93f/524d6e93f19845ce9bb7670374616780.png" alt="image"><br><br>  5. <b>Direct question.</b>  After the launch of the project, you'll be hysterically writing to everyone you know (take my word for it).  Remember, at the end of the dialogue you should ask a very important question - will you support the project?  (or will you become a sponsor?) - this is a very difficult step, but extremely important.  Thus, you invoke the responsibility of a person, he will really think about financing and will not be able to just write "how interesting, I will see." <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/b4b/f74/1c3/b4bf741c327d496e8e904269e8846ded.png" alt="image"><br><br>  That's all, if there is interest, I will continue the topic and write additional tips and results of our project when it is completed.  And remember, there are no trifles in crowdfunding! <br><br>  References: <br>  <a href="http://www.freepik.com/free-vectors/objects">Collection of stock images used in the article</a> <br><br>  PS: <i>Crowdfunding works when the author of the project works.</i> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/295430/">https://habr.com/ru/post/295430/</a></p>
