  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Overview GSmart s1200 or "again did not have time"</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"> Recently I was contacted and offered to take a test device. <br>  I agreed, although I did not know what kind of device I was waiting for. <br>  This is what came out of it or the Gigabyte S1200 Review. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/9aa/c1d/b62/9aac1db6246425c8a38bcd6005f6d0a3.jpg"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  According to the official website: <br>  Operating system :: Windows Mobile 6.1 / 6.5 <br>  Processor :: QUALCOMM 7200A 528 MHz <br>  RAM :: 288 MB <br>  ROM :: 512 MB <br>  Dimensions: 106.0 x 52 x 11.4 mm <br>  Bluetooth :: 2.0 + EDR <br>  WiFi :: 802.11b / g <br>  Connection Interface :: miniUSB 2.0 (High Speed) <br>  FM radio :: Yes <br>  Warranty :: 1 year <br>  Sound :: 128 polyphony, MP3, AAC, WMA, AMR, WAV, MIDI <br>  Display :: 3.1 "WVGA 480x800 <br>  Expansion Slot :: microSD ‚Ñ¢ <br>  Battery :: Li-Pol 1010 mAh <br>  Networks :: GSM 900/1800/1900 UMTS 900/2100 <br>  GPS :: Built-in GPS receiver <br>  Camera :: 3 megapixel with autofocus main, 0.3 megapixel front camera <br>  Software :: IE, Windows Media Player, PowerPoint Mobile, Excel Mobile, Word Mobile, Smart Pack UI <br><br>  So, so, so ... "WinMo" - I thought and took a deep breath ... <br>  The device is not a novelty or to any degree a revelation on the market of smartphones and communicators, however, for those who are familiar with Gigabyte communicators, these characteristics are not an empty set of words. <br>  What to say?  Nice.  Fair.  Without a twinge of conscience.  Beautiful machine. <br>  In Gigabyte, this is the first really pleasant device (for me personally). <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/fd4/1e0/bc8/fd41e0bc883eab4dfa64bb4f65568039.jpg"><br>  Let's take a closer look at it. <br>  Most of the device takes, as is already customary - the display.  Its resolution is 480 * 800 points, the diagonal is 3.1 inches. <br>  The aspect ratio is 16: 9, because of this, Dr. House‚Äôs freshly blended series was stretched and wide smiles looked at me from the screen.  Of course, this can be overcome by selecting the correct resolution, but why refuse something that is so familiar and works? .. <br>  There is practically nothing more to say about the display - it is resistive, it is average.  The grain is fine. <br>  A metal frame passes around the display, like a ... yes, yes!  Iphone  Stylish.  Steel even. <br>  The conversational speaker and the button "choice / action" are made in the same style "kruglyashok with a chrome rim." <br>  The upper part of the device is slightly more rounded than the bottom.  Strange, why did not do symmetrically? <br>  Above the screen, in addition to the speaker, is the front camera and the indicator (it flashes green or red, depending on the situation). <br>  Under the screen, as I said, there is a ‚Äúchoice‚Äù button, and to the left and to the right of it are ‚Äúglass‚Äù buttons for the beginning and end of a conversation.  The first, wherever you are in the menu of the device, will call you a dialer applet;  Well, the second, wherever you are, again, are not - throw you to the home screen. <br><br>  On the left side of the device there are only two volume buttons (by the way, they are terribly implemented in WiMo - the volume is adjusted only by the phone - the main speaker, that is, if you listen to music and press this button - then you change the volume not of the media player, but of the phone ... terribly uncomfortable).  Using these buttons, you can also move up and down through the menu (because there is no hardware joystick). <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/1bb/e25/b70/1bbe25b70b6259c754570bb7b3f4c70d.jpg"><br>  On the upper face is the power button (as well as the screen off) of the device.  Speaker speaker grille (quite such a stylish slot).  The button seemed to me too small.  It is inconvenient to unlock the device in a quick way.

      The right side of the device contains: a slot for a memory card (hot swap - yes, yes), a two-position camera release button. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/e3b/f9f/8f6/e3bf9f8f672aa48ba2e28769dbef5c97.jpg"><br>  At the bottom, there is a connector for connecting a charger, a usb cable, as well as a headset - all in one connector (I won‚Äôt say why this is inconvenient. Who used Siemens would understand).  There is also a microphone hole right there. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/749/f72/eaa/749f72eaa89f770d2337b947fb7f32ed.jpg"><br>  On the back there is nothing but the eye of a three-megapixel camera with autofocus, and of the words ‚Äúgsmart giba-byte communications‚Äù.  Why hyphenated - I do not know. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/edd/8a9/296/edd8a92964548650ab9e4544fdd532f9.jpg"><br>  The device is assembled as a whole not bad.  Almost does not creak.  In the hand sits nicely.  He is thin.  Really thin.  Many of those who saw the device asked that ‚Äúwhat beauty?‚Äù When they heard the ‚Äúgigabyte‚Äù they opened their mouths and rounded their eyes.  The design of the device was a success.  I think it was not without third-party developments. <br><br>  I liked the hardware part of the device.  But the software - no. <br>  I still do not understand - why are such simple things in the winmobile done so ... wrong? <br><br>  For example, I want to dial SMS.  What am I doing in a regular phone?  I go to the menu, select ‚Äúsms‚Äù, press ‚Äúcreate‚Äù, select someone and write. <br>  What am I doing in WinMobile?  I take out the stylus (!!!), press ‚Äústart‚Äù, look for the icon ‚Äúsms‚Äù, press it, press ‚Äúmenu‚Äù, ‚Äúcreate‚Äù, ‚Äúsms‚Äù, I write to someone, I write that. <br>  Without the stylus you can do it.  But why?  Anyway, do not hit the keyboard with the buttons "2.5 * 2.5 mm"!  and these are ‚Äúbig buttons‚Äù. <br>  Allow me ... Since 2002, when I threw away my HP iPaq 2210 PDA, nothing has changed?  all the same terrible keyboard, in which for typing in English, I have to switch the language before each (EACH !!!) letter ???!  not in life!  suggested that you can double tap on the language switch button.  but it's not obvious! <br><br>  Or so: I want to listen to music.  In a regular phone, I insert a headset (headset), select ‚Äúmultimedia‚Äù in the menu and press ‚Äúplay‚Äù.  I'm listening.  I lock the phone, put it in my pocket.  I listen and enjoy. <br>  What am I doing in a winmobile?  I take out the stylus (eeeeeeeeee) ... Okay.  I'll try without a stylus.  On the home screen, with the rocker, I select the ‚Äúmusic‚Äù widget, scroll with my finger left and right, I select the track, I press on it - it plays.  I lock the screen - he shut up.  Bue?  BUEEEEee! <br>  So let's go to the menu (with the stylus !!!), select ‚Äúmultimedia‚Äù, see: FM radio, voice recorder, java, camera, streaming player, photo and video, photo viewing ... So.  Whole two photo viewers, but NO PLAYER ?? <br>  No, he is.  it's just not in this menu.  I press the red button, drop into the home screen, press the ‚Äústart‚Äù stylus, scroll down to ‚Äúwindows media‚Äù, see it, select STYLUS (because it‚Äôs impossible to use my finger) the library menu, choose what I want to hear.  I shake.  I am waiting.  I shake ... DAMN!  You need to click "play" below !!!  FFFFFFFFUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUuu! <br>  Plays.  Finally!!!  I press the lock button.  He shuts up.  Whatoooooooooo?!?!?!  I press the button to unlock.  He is silent.  I press "play", I press on the button "choice", it extinguishes the screen ... Plays ... The volume changes only at the phone itself.  to change the volume of the player - you need to press in the "+" and "-" ... WHAT FOR ...?!?!?!  FOR WHAT - or rather ... <br>  Not.  WinMo - not for me. <br>  In conclusion of the review of the software, I will say that all the shells written by gigabyte itself are beautiful.  Not quite usable, but pleasing to the eye. <br>  Controlling the camera is lovely. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/8ed/e80/c19/8ede80c19384815f0223fa5668a34e91.jpg"><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/a95/417/145/a9541714553db0e28275ea86be1c6d23.jpg"><br>  Dialer drawn cool. <br>  Speaking of a call, it rings, yes.  Everything is good.  This is what I remember about the GSmart MW700 and MS800, which have had a network failure where others have it. <br>  Yes.  Wi-Fi receiver is not so good.  I have all my devices (iphone, HTC Hero, Nokia N82, EEE PC 700, EEE PC 901) even on the stairs, and this one in the next room does not see the access point ... Strange.  But maybe it's a curve vinmo ... Or me.  ;)) <br><br>  In general and in general - the impressions are positive.  But I could not use it simply because of the winmobile.  Those for whom the system is a plus - get another one.  Price - 15,000 rubles.  For this price you get a functional and stylish device. <br><br>  Examples of photos taken by the device: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/778/1cc/029/7781cc0295a04334a6144bc30e3c8ea4.jpg"><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/6c1/d23/7f9/6c1d237f9325724faaadb1ba86725b15.jpg"><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/5ef/6cf/2ac/5ef6cf2ace92341a4ad1992f8fe88e02.jpg"><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/3ae/44e/a8f/3ae44ea8f342c6e4815b3e42365480a6.jpg"><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/0df/816/e19/0df816e194fe09ae40aa36ac50d12e23.jpg"><br></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/81530/">https://habr.com/ru/post/81530/</a></p>
