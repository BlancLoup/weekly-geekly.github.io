  <section class="page js-page"><h1>One task, three tools: cPanel, ISPmanager and Plesk</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  This is <a href="http://americanohost.ru/">our</a> remake Il buono, il brutto, il cattivo.  Although the hosting hub on Habr√© is quite numerous, I <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/173687/">don‚Äôt recall</a> here a single attempt to <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/158261/">compare</a> commercial <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/109451/">hosting panels</a> .  The only exception is the translation review in three parts ( <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/120821/">1</a> , <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/120923/">2</a> , <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/120961/">3</a> ), but it does not take into account the Russian realities. <br>  In particular, the translation review is missing one of the products popular in our country.  Since I have been engaged in the topic of shared hosting for more than three years, the means of organizing and managing hosting services, I decided to analyze three solutions that are popular in Russia.  Here is a subjective comparison of three paid hosting panels.  I ask all interested under the cat. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/c94/c30/146/c94c30146ac22e27ad17f1f0d3f9726e.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h2>  Disclaimer </h2><br>  When comparing the three control panels, the actions of the virtual hosting user or the system administrator who sets up the panel were considered.  That part of the review, which relates to the usability of products, is based on the author‚Äôs life experience and is his subjective opinion.  Therefore, I ask the most irreconcilable commentators to take this fact into account.

      In the review, I will try to tabulate the various aspects of the functionality of each of the experimental panels.  Explanations will be given to some separate things. <br><br>  So, at the sight of <a href="http://www.parallels.com/ru/products/plesk/">Parallels Plesk Panel 11</a> (since 2001 the latest version is 07/2012), <a href="http://cpanel.net/cpanel-whm/">cPanel 11.34</a> (since 1996, the latest version is 10/2012) and <a href="http://ispsystem.com/ru/software/ispmanager">ISPmanager 4, Lite</a> (c 1997, last version - 09/2012).  Tables are made with pictures so that they do not spread out. <br><br><h2>  Categories of comparison </h2><br><ul><li>  Convenience of navigation inside the panel; </li><li>  Work with domains and subdomains; </li><li>  Mail user administration; </li><li>  Administer user ftp; </li><li>  Setting up and administering the MySQL database; </li><li>  Web server statistics; </li><li>  Work with files on hosting; </li><li>  Security settings; </li><li>  Transfer sites between control panels; </li><li>  Create backup copies; </li><li>  Anroid-and iOS-applications for managing panels. </li></ul><br><br><h2>  Panel Navigation </h2><br>  The most convenient navigation is done in Parallels Plesk Panel and ISPmanager.  The horizontal menu "Splash" is accessible from anywhere on the panel.  The menu hierarchy is such that transitions to subsections are possible only by selecting the appropriate section. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/5e1/ea9/2e6/5e1ea92e6ec7d16b91051d18419104a6.jpg"><br><br>  The vertical menu of ISPmanager is initially maximized, but does not fit entirely into the screen.  There are three options for displaying the panel menu, plus it is possible to collect the most frequently used items in the "Favorites". <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/a1d/88b/3a6/a1d88b3a6e934e8db5f94c40494b92a1.jpg"><br><br>  cPanel is an outsider in terms of usability.  It does not have a menu as such.  Moving within the panel is possible only by clicking on the icons in the main screen or at the top of the current subsection.  To move to another section, you must return to the main screen.  This is frankly inconvenient.  However, enthusiasts have already written a module <a href="http://www.rvskin.com/">RVSkin</a> , which organized a horizontal menu with drop-down submenus. <br><br><h2>  Work with domains and subdomains </h2><br>  In all panels there are basic functions for adding, deleting domains and subdomains, as well as settings for processing requests to them.  Plesk and ISPManager have the most advanced options for configuring DNS domain records. <br><br>  At Plesk in the list of domains, in front of each domain is a block of icons, which are shortcuts to a number of functions for monitoring and managing the domain. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/e18/dbd/af1/e18dbdaf10d6e17161f00007be5522e5.png"><br><br>  Plesk and ISPManager are convenient because all the additional settings and functions related to domains and sites are grouped in one panel section.  With ISPManager, it is conveniently done to immediately, when adding a domain, specify aliases to this domain ‚Äî other domains and subdomains that will point to the same site. <br><br>  The disadvantages of cPanel are the limited options for setting up DNS domain records, creating a subdomain to the main domain each time a domain is added.  This leads to a wasteful quota for subdomains.  The idea of ‚Äã‚Äãplacing the main domain files in the root folder of the user also does not seem reasonable. <br><br>  The pivot table of the functionality of the domain management panels looks like this. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/d6e/b6f/81e/d6eb6f81e91a6d93e898a9ceed79c02a.jpg"><br><br><h2>  Mail Administration </h2><br>  On the possibilities of global settings for handling mail and administering users, cPanel provides the widest possibilities.  But the rich functionality is scattered in 14 (!) Items of the main control panel.  It saves the fact that the shortcuts to these functions are collected in one block on the main page of the panel.  CPanel also highlights the ability to download automatic configuration scripts for four popular email clients. <br><br>  Setting up email accounts is very conveniently organized in Parallels Plesk Panel.  It is doubly pleased that the options are accompanied by brief but understandable ‚Äúhuman‚Äù explanations.  Tips will help to adapt if the administrator recently switched to Plesk from other solutions. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/301/bd7/9f0/301bd79f002e18b5eedc3f8364e27a8a.png"><br><br>  In this panel - the most comfortable procedure for creating a box, setting all its properties and related functions. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/1fd/f4f/35c/1fdf4f35c9bb4e71de763f719481d6bd.jpg"><br><br><h2>  Administering FTP Users </h2><br>  Of the three panels in question, the most tools for working with FTP are provided by the cPanel user. <br><br>  Plesk and ISPManager panels allow you to create or delete an FTP user, specify the path to its home folder, set a disk space limit, and change the password. <br><br>  Both cPanel and Parallels Plesk have the ability to control current sessions of connections to the FTP server and the ability to organize anonymous access using the FTP protocol.  The creators of cPanel also took care to simplify the user to set up FTP client programs with clear instructions directly in the panel and the ability to download automatic configuration files for three FTP client programs. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/179/5b5/59f/1795b559fb0e2a08e271a70dac40716a.jpg"><br><br><h2>  Setting up and administering MySQL </h2><br>  All hosting review panels provide sufficient and convenient MySQL database management tools, which include not only the standard database creation / deletion functions, MySQL and PhpMyAdmin users, but also setting user rights, setting up remote access to MySQL database tables databases. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/995/100/5d1/9951005d19616e37e591778b683e958b.jpg"><br><br>  There is a life hack that works for the Windows version of Parallels Plesk Panel.  It is possible to add two types of databases - MySQL and MSSQL.  Many users often confuse these two types of databases.  As a result, they cannot connect to the MSSQL database via Phpmyadmin, but only to the Mysql database via Webadmin, which is usually installed on servers with ‚ÄúSplash‚Äù support for managing SQL databases. <br><br><h2>  Web server logs statistics </h2><br>  There are two ways to get information about site visitors.  The first is a web server log analysis.  The second is the use of a JS counter installed on the page. <br><br>  In the first case, a program is installed on the server that analyzes the web server logs and creates user-friendly reports on their basis.  These are programs such as AwStats, Webalizer, Analog or Logaholic.  In the second case, a javascript code is installed on each analyzed page of the site, which, when entering the page, sends information about the visitor to a special server.  The server accumulates, processes data and creates reports for the user.  Examples are Google Analytics and Yandex.Metrica. <br><br>  Log files analysis takes place on your server and does not require installation of additional elements on the pages.  The disadvantage is that if the page is loaded from the browser's cache, nothing will appear in the logs on the hosting.  Since the javascript code is always executed, using the js counter will give more complete information about visitors (although some percentage of those visitors whose browsers have javascript disabled are disabled) will remain unrecorded. <br><br>  At first glance, cPanel is somewhat larger than its competitors, the ability to generate reports, and they are divided so that it is convenient for the user to navigate in these reports.  But a more detailed acquaintance showed that in terms of reporting, the cPanel functionality is redundant.  For example, it is possible to work with as many as four log processing programs - Webalizer, Analog, Logaholic and AwStats.  However, there is a possibility that the server statistics calculation may not work correctly if the server is located behind a caching proxy or CDN (like CloudFlare).  And although CloudFlare itself supplies a module to an ‚ÄúApache‚Äù for solving this problem, this may not work with other CDNs.  Another point: server counting gives much less information than Google Analytics or Yandex.Metrica.  Therefore, now it is used less actively than before. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/01c/c73/5ef/01cc735efcc93340d54aa346e30fb923.png"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/63a/e3a/69d/63ae3a69d0f21fa5396bac106526ed3e.jpg"><br><br><h2>  Work with files on hosting </h2><br>  In cPanel there is a function of a web disk, a search for a file or folder is provided.  ISPManager has the largest list of supported archivers.  In Parallels Plesk Panel has the ability to preview sites.  This feature will be useful if you have moved site files from one server to another, but have not yet redirected the domain to a new server or have not had time to update the DNS.  In this case, before redirecting the site to a new server, you can view the site‚Äôs work, and see if everything works correctly on the new server. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/74e/bd2/913/74ebd2913acf3201045686bb1c0d3ff2.jpg"><br><br><h2>  Security Settings </h2><br>  Configuring the security of virtual hosting involves two areas: protecting the connection to the site and restricting access to the site.  To protect the connection, there are tools for working with SSL certificates.  They are present in all three panels considered.  As for access restrictions, all three panels have password protection for site folders.  ISPManager has exhausted its security settings, and Parallels Plesk and cPanel have protection against hotlinking.  cPanel also offers the possibility of restricting access to a site by IP address and working with GnuPG. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/d14/730/f04/d14730f04e3e7e022898af69eda60d3c.jpg"><br><br><h2>  Backup Creation </h2><br>  The best is the backup organization in Parallels Plesk.  This panel has an important advantage over competitors - it is possible to set a password to encrypt the backup file.  The backup capabilities in cPanel are limited due to the lack of automatic backups at the level of the virtual hosting user.  In addition, it can be backed up only manually. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/625/d6c/699/625d6c6995c27d594372d9a971f82e7c.jpg"><br><br>  A case from practice.  As you know, most users ask for backup at night (when night is in the region where most of the site users are located) in order to minimize the load on the site and, accordingly, on the server.  In the product from the ISP, the server does not freeze during the creation of backups.  But in Parallels Plesk there is an option Suspend user while a backup is generated.  It disables the site and the rest of the services of your domain at the time of the backup.  For a hoster this is good - the load on the server during backup will be minimal - but for the client it is not very.  His site will be unavailable all this time.  Users often choose this option mechanically, without even thinking what it may lead to.  As a result, during the creation of a backup, access to the panel and sites will be blocked, and you will not be able to do anything until the backup is completely created.  And if you have 50 GB of data, you will have to wait a very long time - from several hours to several days.  So beware. <br><br><h2>  Final comparison </h2><br>  It is time to draw a line under the subjective impressions. <br><br>  <b>Parallels Plesk Panel</b> was impressed with an easy-to-use, but at the same time powerful and full-featured tool.  It is devoid of the disadvantages of usability and shortened backup options inherent in cPanel, and also provides richer functionality in all that concerns FTP access (unlike ISPManager).  It is surprising how simple and seemingly obvious comments on the buttons of the panel make it easier for the user to complete the task.  I would recommend Plesk as a solution for a hoster who is thinking of moving from a ‚Äúcustom-made‚Äù or open-source panel to a proprietary one.  If you pay a little more money, you can get a panel from Parallels with built-in Parallels Web Presence Builder website builder. <br><br>  Subjectively, ‚ÄúSplash‚Äù lacks access to any jungle of the menu using pass-through navigation.  Living with her would be much easier.  For the rest, I did not notice such panel features that would be critical and absent. <br><br>  The variety and even some redundancy of functions for each section in <b>cPanel</b> (for example, three programs for working with mail through a web interface or four programs for creating reports from web server statistics) provides a rich choice for users, but causes a logical question: ‚ÄúWhy?‚Äù Perhaps This historical heritage or the result of requests from different groups of users.  Otherwise, it is difficult to understand the reason for such a ‚Äúzoo‚Äù. <br><br>  An extremely inconvenient navigation system (only shortcuts from the main screen) provided cPanel with a disservice in setting the final grade.  The lack of the ability to configure automatic creation of backups on a schedule in a professional tool looks weird.  This is superimposed by the well-known cPanel flaw - the creation of subdomains of the main domain for each additional domain.  At the same time, few people compare with cPanel in that it is connected with security settings and with work with MySQL. <br><br>  A significant advantage of <b>ISPManager</b> is very easy navigation and the ability to import user accounts as a full backup from other panels (cPanel, Parallels Plesk and Directadmin).  The disadvantage of this panel is the limited functions for managing FTP access and security settings.  But no one else has the support of the .rar format so popular in our file manager when working with archives. <br><br>  Among the three panels in question, only for cPanel there are programs for managing hosting from mobile devices.  Although Parallels Plesk has <a href="http://www.parallels.com/products/plesk/power-pack/plesk-mobile-server-manager/">its own product</a> , it is intended only for dedicated physical servers and VPS.  The shared hosting account (Customer role model) is not supported. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/33c/ba8/549/33cba8549352d7589299dd546c6945cd.jpg"><br><br>  The table below provides estimates for the three panels in all categories for which a comparison was made.  5 points - subjectively the best result, 1 point - subjectively the worst. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/33f/228/816/33f2288167a444951a475d68982f4656.jpg"><br><br>  And finally - a table comparing options and the cost of licenses for the use of panels. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/91d/930/a6f/91d930a6f8f356d7e3dca17ab79bc3a4.jpg"><br><br>  It means that when renting a panel license for two years, Plesk and cPanel have a discount of about 9%, when renting for 3 years - a discount of about 15%, ISPManager does not offer discounts on rent, but only he has the opportunity to purchase an eternal license.  For modern professional software, which is sold mainly by subscription, this is rare. <br><br>  Read on to <a href="http://americanohost.ru/">our site</a> . </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/173787/">https://habr.com/ru/post/173787/</a></p>
