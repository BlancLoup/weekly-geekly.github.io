  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Jabra Halo 2 Bluetooth Stereo Headset and Laptop</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  This little post is about the experience of using a wireless stereo headset in order to listen to music from a laptop, as well as about the small but nasty problem of connecting and how I almost solved it unintentionally.  For some, it may seem obvious, but I did not find the answer in Google. <br><br><img src="http://sidex.ru/images_offers/1623/thumb/jabra_bt650_halo_2.jpg" align="left">  Once it turned out that I was looking for a replacement for my old headphones with a completely broken headband.  There were 5 meters of wires in them, because on the table between the headphones and the laptop there was always a roll of this cable, intercepted by a clip for wires.  This influenced my choice in the direction of the wireless headset.  Next - as usual: googled, clicked on the list, read reviews, chose, ordered, brought. <br><br>  One can simply say about her appearance: I wouldn‚Äôt have walked out into big headphones, but for the house it‚Äôs the most: not burdocks, but not gags, quite comfortable.  However, after 3-4 hours the ears ache a little - the headset presses down.  The rest is just some kind of holiday: the wires do not hang out (the keyboard and mouse are also wireless), if you need to move away from the computer, you do not need to remove the headphones and stop the music, if you go out for a smoke, the headset also finishes you well.  Yes, at least you can go to the toilet =) <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Plus a fabulous thing: if the headset is discharged, then it can be connected with a 3.5 mm audio output cord in the box (I tried it cleanly once) or another cord in the box to the USB connector (I always do this when I have to).  In the latter case, it is, respectively, parallel to the music, and it also charges, t.ch.  after some time (about 2 hours), it can again be used via bluetooth.  A more convenient option is to charge for the night.

      And everything was fine, the headset was connected to any phone, it also connected to the laptop (Intel's Bluetooth stack), but there was one problem: turn off the headset, then turn it back on - it is not picked up.  If you get into the bluetooth device and go into the properties of the headset, then the laptop starts to interrogate it, but to no avail - it falls off by timeout.  Only one thing saved: remove the device, cut down the headset and turn on in pairing mode (hold the button for 5 seconds immediately after turning it on), then it is added again, rechecks all the firewood in the internet and starts working.  But it is really long, annoying.  I tried all the combinations, nothing helped. <br><br>  Everything was decided simply and completely by accident: it turned out that I did not try one combination: first I had to go into the properties of the headset, the laptop began to look for it, and at that moment it could be turned on: it finds everything at once. <br>  As a result, the option was still not the most convenient - you need to poke more on your computer instead of just turning on the headset, but I haven‚Äôt found the best yet. <br><br>  If someone helps the post - I will be glad.  If someone knows where to turn on, so that the headset picks up on its own, without tychkov on the laptop, and writes about it in the comments - I will be glad twice =) <br><br>  <b>UPD: in</b> spite of the abundance of ministers, the post in drafts will not be removed until at least 1 person has added it to the favorites.
