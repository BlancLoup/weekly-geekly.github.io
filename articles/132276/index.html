  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Life without patents - for and against</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  On Habr√© you can often read the crushing on patents (especially in the context of the wars between Samsung and Apple).  But would it really be easier to live and work (especially for small companies) in a world without patents? <br><br>  Let's look at the life course of two engineers, in the world with patents and without. <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  Once there was a talented, say designer.  And once he came up with an interface (say, mobile devices) that far exceeds all existing ones, and will inevitably become the only true one in the future.  And he wanted our talent to get rich on this.  In order to get money, you have to sell something. <br>  The designer has 3 warainta: <br>  Release your mobile devices. <br>  Release software for existing devices <br>  Sell ‚Äã‚Äãyour patent or license to other companies. 
      <br>
        <script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>
        <ins class="adsbygoogle"
          style="display:block; text-align:center;"
          data-ad-layout="in-article"
          data-ad-format="fluid"
          data-ad-client="ca-pub-6974184241884155"
          data-ad-slot="8945601208"></ins>
        <script>
          (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
        </script>
      <br>
      But from this moment, the fun begins. <br><br><h5>  World with patents </h5><br>  To release mobile devices - let's say right away, is unlikely to happen.  Firstly, huge investments are needed, and secondly, you will be bound hand and foot with patent deductions to other companies. <br><br>  To release software can be a great success, because there is a lot of free software to which you can screw your design.  But, of course, significant investments are also needed to support such software. <br><br>  And finally - you can simply sell the license (or the entire patent in its entirety) and not fool yourself.  Although probably the courts can spoil the whole "raspberry".  This option, in my opinion, is most acceptable, because  our designer does not risk anything (except for money for patenting), and if his idea fails - well, it‚Äôs not fatal. <br><br><h5>  World without patents </h5><br>  Hurray, there are no patents, you can do anything and not pay anyone royalties!  Hmm, although wait, if there are no patents, then every invention is hidden in the depths of the company, an engineer is signed by the NDA, and so on.  Of course, there are leaks, but they are expensive.  Thus, the money for the start of its production needs much more (even cunning Chinese could not do anything in such conditions).  But even if everything works out, there will be investors, then after the release of the first device, the struggle against the titans of the market will begin, which, of course, will simply copy the interface (there are no patents).  And to win this war - it will be sooooo hard. <br><br>  To release software is also hopeless.  After all, your interface will be instantly copied by device manufacturers, and there will be no point in installing alternative software.  The only chance to win is to conclude a contract with some vendor for the supply of your software. <br><br>  And selling licenses in the world without patents is of course impossible (yes, no one will simply buy) <br><br><h5>  Conclusion </h5><br>  Lack of patents on the one hand would completely block the road to small companies (all technologies are hidden behind seven locks, at the same time, all innovations are shamelessly copied), and on the other hand it would slow down the development of design, since  he would have ceased to be a competitive advantage. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/132276/">https://habr.com/ru/post/132276/</a></p>
