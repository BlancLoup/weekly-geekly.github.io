Hello friends in misfortune!  Probably it will be interesting and apartment owners, with a finished repair.  As a fact: the house stands, it is almost finished, you can live ... but all sorts of ‚ÄúWishlist‚Äù begin to come out, which you haven‚Äôt foreseen or were too lazy to do at an earlier stage.  It will be a question of convenient management of light (or other electric devices).  Is it true that you want the switch to be in a convenient place !?  And even better is the ‚Äúpultik‚Äù, which can lie next to the sofa ... The essence of the problem being solved: electricity in the house and the plot is somehow divorced.  But it turns out that in order to turn on or turn off the light on the edge of the plot, one has to reach the switch, which is also located there.  I decided to simplify my life. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  The first causative agent of technical thought was the area for grilling.  Electricity is supplied to it immediately from the meter on the pole, from it the power cable goes to the house underground (the requirement of the wife, who did not accept the overhead line).  When electrifying the site, it seemed logical not to pull the cable out of the house for a new trench, but to take 220 volts from the nearest source.  As a result - the switch remained attached to the site.  You notice that you forgot to turn off the light, you can only from the window of the 2nd floor, and then get dressed - go out into the street, or the light will be lit all night.  Here is a video that will show the situation "on the ground" <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/v_F7AARCr0E%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700002,15700022,15700186,15700191,15700248,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhgQhpHV4u9Z0pq-0AJKPVy8TtdSfQ" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>

      And as is clear from the video, for myself I chose the best, namely the system of parallel remote control at a frequency of 433 MHz, which we had ‚Äúinvented‚Äù shortly before in Master Kit who was a little different for another project.  The highlight of this system is that each channel operates independently of the other.  While the traditional remote control with a keychain or remote get stuck, while pressing the buttons. <br><br>  The main module of the system - the transmitter has a <a href="http://masterkit.ru/shop/smarthome/distant-control-433/2016233">part number MP3329 SE</a> <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/e9c/849/f43/e9c849f4395743d1b1ba5e3540b511a1.jpg" align="right">  (pic. right) <br>  The radio channel is made on the popular radio module RFM-12 with frequency modulation, which improves the quality and reliability of communication.  Experienced proven range of stable operation: about 100 m in open areas when using antennas in the form of a piece of wire.  This range can be slightly increased if you install an remote antenna with additional gain, for example, <a href="http://www.electronshik.ru/item/ant-433-by-433-06-sma-m-3m-305230">such</a> .  A space is provided on the transmitter for the corresponding connector. Additionally, to improve the reliability of the entire system, feedback has been introduced into the operation logic.  That is, after sending the command to the executive relay, the transmitter waits for a response from it and, if it does not, makes two more similar attempts.  If no response is received in this case either, an alarm occurs on a separate line. <br><br>  A small digression ... We developed the MP3329SE system for wireless repeaters of brake lights and turn signals for transport trucks, which are assembled into an auto train and move around the airfield.  Flashlights with executive relays and their own batteries with magnets are attached to the extreme truck and over the air receive signals of braking and turns from the tractor.  If the lamp is lost or the battery is discharged, the driver receives a warning signal.  When some carts are placed under the lights, the lamps are transferred by the driver to the extreme carriage of an already loaded train, ready for movement.  And so on.  Read more about this in another article and video ... <br><br>  So, from the airfield back to the cottage and its lighting. <br><br>  To power the entire system, both the transmitter and the executive relays use 12-15 Volts DC.  Perhaps there is some inconvenience in this, that an additional power source is required, however it is much safer than capacitor power sources, which are widely used in conventional remote controls.  After all, you will install them yourself, so it is better not to risk it with galvanically untied current sources.  And to pick up the source is not so difficult, any network adapters, which often lie in the closet as an inheritance from old electronics, will do.  I did so, to save space, I removed the plastic case, removing the power supply board itself. <br><br>  The same 12 volts are used to supply a control signal to the transmitter inputs.  The logic is simple, filed 12 volts to the transmitter input - the executive relay turned on, removed the voltage - the relay turned off.  Accordingly, if you use a conventional switch, the relay will remain on while the switch is in the on position.  If you control using the button, the relay is on while you hold the button down. <br><br>  Now more about the executive relay.  Their 3 options.  On <a href="http://masterkit.ru/shop/smarthome/distant-control-433/1890072">one channel</a> , <a href="http://masterkit.ru/shop/smarthome/distant-control-433/1890083">two</a> and <a href="http://masterkit.ru/shop/smarthome/distant-control-433/2086920">six</a> <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/47e/aa7/243/47eaa7243aae47019aa38f4900fee03e.jpg" align="left"><br>  Single-channel and two-channel relays, in addition to radio-controlled, have pins for local control using a button, which is very convenient.  And these conclusions can be used to connect limit switches or security sensors, if you have to do anything to control moving objects, such as gates, barriers, doors, transom for ventilation of the greenhouse. <br>  In the case of pump control, a level sensor, such as a float switch, can be connected to these outputs.  It will protect the container from overflow. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/928/6bd/dc5/9286bddc5aa44bbd92e887fef67440aa.jpg" align="right"><br>  A six-channel relay is suitable for the case when the power wires to electrical installations for you diverge from one place, for example, from a switchboard.  This module can be placed in a plastic case, which can be purchased <a href="http://www.electronshik.ru/item/box-m31np-28882">separately</a> . <br><br>  In addition to the transmitter and actuating relays, a <a href="http://masterkit.ru/shop/smarthome/smarthouse/1494484">small console</a> with 4 control buttons for one- and two-channel relays can be introduced into the system.  If you connect the remote control to a six-channel relay, the first 4 channels will be controlled. <br><br>  The number of connected consoles, transmitters and relays must be said separately.  The memory of the MP3329SE transmitter can memorize up to 255 actuators.  Thus, each channel of the transmitter can be connected with a dozen executive relays that will work in parallel or replace each other.  As it is done in in the stop light repeaters.  While one set of lanterns on charging is working the second, then they change. <br>  The memory of each relay is designed for 30 control devices (remote control or transmitter). That is, one relay can be controlled from several places of the equipped territory, several transmitters. <br><br>  So, the MP3329SE remote control is designed for fixed installation and works on the principle of "radio cable".  That is, instead of laying the cable, you can adjust the radio channel. <br>  The capabilities of the system can be expanded as needed, using different actuators.  Appetite, as we know, comes with eating ... <br>  It is possible to control without using a radio channel, using a local switch located near your electrical appliance. <br><br>  So, before you take up a cable spade or a perforator, when planning to drill or drill a wall, think of the wonderful radio waves that can pass through walls.  As the chef says, "Without noise and dust." <br><br>  Interested !?
