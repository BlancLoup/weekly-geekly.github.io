Finally, the stock of ultrabooks <br>  I ended up on the Intel Sandy Bridge platform.  Extreme "ultrabook" <br>  In this series I want to talk about - this is the Acer Aspire M3.  Why in <br>  quotes?  Because the 15.6 "diagonal doesn‚Äôt fit into my ideas about <br>  ultra-compact laptops, as well as weight 2 <br>  pounds.  Why all the same, it belongs to this family and <br>  What other surprises are hidden in this device, it is painted under the cut. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/0bf/df6/78f/0bfdf678fec2fd0e3f35132c13d28821.jpg"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  In order not to delay the answers to the questions that are stated before the kata <br>  I'll start with four criteria that Intel calls <br>  mandatory for the device to be called an ultrabook. <br>  1) Ultra-thin - the device should be thinner than 18 mm for devices with <br>  display up to 14 "and thinner than 21 mm for displays larger than 14" - Acer Aspire M3 <br>  has a thickness of 20 mm - meets the requirements of Intel?  Yes. <br>  2) Ultrafast - The processor must belong to the family of Intel Core <br>  second or third generation and have a heat pack of 17 watts.  My <br>  option Acer Aspire M3 has an inside Intel Core i5 2467M with thermal <br>  with 17 watts  Corresponds to?  Yes. <br>  3) Instant Awakening - Exit sleep mode in less than 2 seconds, <br>  exit from hibernation mode - in 7 seconds.  SSD is used for this purpose. <br>  small volume where data are stored and at the expense of the Intel technology <br>  Rapid start requirement is met.  And yes again. <br>  4) Energy efficient - More than 5 hours of battery life even at the most <br>  thin models according to indications MobileMark 2007. Discuss the quality and <br>  the relevance of the test will not (I personally do not like it), but the requirements <br>  Intel respected.  For the fourth question, the answer is yes. <br><br>  What we have is a 15.6 "screen, a keyboard with an additional digital <br>  block, discrete graphics card GerForce GT 640M, DVD-drive, weight 2.1 <br>  kilograms - and all this is called ultrabook?!? <br>  But what about SSD drives, thin lines, 13.3 "screens, weight about a kilogram? <br>  How does the comparison with the MacBook Air? <br>  Apparently nothing.  It seems to me that "the world has moved from its place" and soon everything <br>  computers that can be carried (read, all laptops) <br>  will be called ultrabooks.  Not because Intel wants it, but because <br>  that the trend towards refinement and autonomy can be traced <br>  long time ago, and now the right moment has arrived. <br>  Alienware gaming monsters will remain in their niche <br>  tablets will take their own, and classic laptops will disappear altogether.  However, <br>  This is the lyrics, the answer to the question - why is this what I intend to tell <br>  called an ultrabook is obtained, so let's proceed to the discussion <br>  the test subject. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/d94/c71/489/d94c714894a66a924d7fa5c5a67e083b.jpg"><br>  Good people from Acer think about their customers and the box has a pen for <br>  carrying.  Making minimalist - white cardboard, two photos of the device, <br>  vendor's logo and mention that Acer is official <br>  partner of the Olympic Games. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/994/d8e/ccc/994d8eccc11c1acd0ef10f383a03ba44.jpg"><br>  The kit also does not please with special excesses.  Two guides and everything. <br>  There are no covers, adapters and other small things that can <br>  cause a short-term release of endorphins in the blood. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/136/f8b/455/136f8b455891de436826cc196d91bb73.jpg"><br>  And here is the scourge of ultrabooks - the charger.  Already simply no strength <br>  talk about it, well, I want damn compactness, although where did she come from <br>  in a 15.6 "screen.

      The following configuration of Acer Aspire M3 fell into my hands <br><br><br><table><tbody><tr><td>  CPU </td><td> Intel Core i5 2467M (1.6 GHz), 2 cores, L3 3 MB cache, NT, <br>  TDP 17 W </td></tr><tr><td>  Chipset </td><td>  Intel HM77 Express </td></tr><tr><td>  RAM </td><td>  4 GB DDR3 1333 MHz in dual channel mode (one bracket 2 GB and 2 GB soldered on the motherboard) </td></tr><tr><td>  Video card </td><td>  Intel HD Graphics 3000 core speed dynamically <br>  varies from 350 MHz to 1150 MHz + NVIDIA GeForce GT 640M (405 MHz is the frequency of the graphics core and 900 MHz is the frequency of the video memory) </td></tr><tr><td>  Network devices </td><td>  Wi-Fi 802.11 b / g / n, Bluetooth, <br>  Gigabit ethernet </td></tr><tr><td>  Storage System </td><td>  HDD: Hitachi 500 Gb SATA II + SSD: SATA II 20 <br>  Gb </td></tr><tr><td>  Integrated devices </td><td>  1.3 MP webcam, microphone, DVD-multi drive </td></tr><tr><td>  Ports for connecting devices </td><td>  Two USB 2.0 ports, one USB 3.0 port, one HDMI port, <br>  one <br>  combo audio jack (headphone and microphone), one gigabit port <br>  Ethernet one <br>  VGA port, 1 SDXC / SDHC / SD / MMC card reader </td></tr><tr><td>  Display </td><td>  15.6 ‚Äù, resolution 1366 * 768 </td></tr><tr><td>  Battery </td><td>  3-section, Li-Ion, 4850 mAh </td></tr><tr><td>  Weight </td><td>  2.1 kg </td></tr></tbody></table><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/c04/77f/a28/c0477fa28837f9af554fac59cbef7980.jpg"><br>  The case of the Acer Aspire M3 looks interesting, the aluminum cover is painted in <br>  black color.  It is the manufacturer's logo. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/b5e/c57/944/b5ec57944f3bd873c16d59c00244138a.jpg"><br><br>  The power button is nontrivial and many times from the first <br>  will find her.  Engineers hid it on the front edge of the ultrabook, next to <br>  power and charge indicators.  Hard Drive Activity Indicator <br>  absent altogether. <br><habracut><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/e35/6d1/c62/e356d1c62ee1f8c9c13eef91b643654a.jpg"><br><br>  Stickers have not disappeared, but it is worth noting that this time <br>  used stylish gray instead of multi-colored.  Logo appeared <br>  NVIDIA GeForce GT. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/bcb/72b/5b7/bcb72b5b7c386255e5fd0784e0a43fd6.jpg"><br><br>  The right side of the ultrabook is free of additional decorations, here is only the logo of the Timeline series. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/143/774/f8d/143774f8d11d5e09cbd59afa85bc1504.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/db8/f2e/69a/db8f2e69a1092156a817785c04c4ef50.jpg"><br><br>  Keyboard island type, the keys have a short stroke, letters <br>  English and Russian layouts are applied in the same white color.  On right <br>  there is an additional digital block that is optional <br>  advantage for those who work a lot with digital data. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/e23/720/eb5/e23720eb539ae2d79c91b42fbd7213cd.jpg"><br><br>  The touchpad is large and comfortable, the keys are not structurally highlighted.  To some <br>  I do not like the shift of the touchpad relative to the center of the ultrabook, but this <br>  a matter of habit. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/63b/503/cd1/63b503cd19d2e806d0be19eaaa5f9986.jpg"><br><br>  Another surprise from engineers.  All ports are located on the rear panel. <br>  Damn inconvenient solution for me, every time I need to connect <br>  USB flash drive, you have to lift the laptop or cover the lid.  However, <br>  if frequent carrier changes are not required, the solution will be convenient, <br>  because the wires do not crawl on the table and do not interfere with the mouse <br>  or documents. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/4df/976/aa2/4df976aa23be1ce9befe590555da0e94.jpg"><br><br>  On the left, the Acer Aspire M3 has a DVD drive and an SD / MMC memory card reader. <br><br>  On the matrix of the laptop I will say a few neutral words.  Of course, 15.6 "is the most common matrix format and 1366 * 768 is the most <br>  common resolution, but in an ultrabook I would like to see <br>  1600 * 900 (holivar on this topic has been going on for a long time).  The advantages include <br>  you can only the fact that this permission will easily pump <br>  GeForce GT 640M graphics card.  By cons - glossiness (and on this topic <br>  holivar is coming), terrible viewing angles (hi TN matrix) and uneven <br>  flare.  The budget of the used matrix is ‚Äã‚Äãreflected in full. <br><br>  With the appearance of everything seems to be clear, inside the Acer Aspire M3 dig deeper <br>  can be with pleasure.  A small cover allows access to the hard <br>  disk, RAM, SSD drive and wireless network controller. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/aaf/0ea/a3d/aaf0eaa3d748023e57fef0c45b7909f1.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/42c/00d/ff7/42c00dff7657e73207c8da9023055de4.jpg"><br><br>  After dismantling the memory strip, you can contemplate chips soldered on the board <br>  Memory in the amount of 4 pieces.  4 more are located on the back <br>  fees.  Manufacturer - Elpida.  The same Elpida BDBG chips are used. <br>  on many budget memory modules for desktop computers. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/b95/8be/a1f/b958bea1f9bb60cf8dc05164dcdbae28.jpg"><br><br>  Here is a separate module.  Manufacturer company Micron, capacity 2 <br>  gigabyte speed rating of 10600, which corresponds to the frequency of 1333 MHz. <br>  The module can be replaced with analogs with a capacity of 4 gigabytes, increasing <br>  The most total amount of RAM is up to 6 gigabytes.  Support 8 <br>  gigabyte is not claimed, I didn‚Äôt have such a bar at hand, <br>  so I could not check. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/315/555/21b/31555521b409d38ec0c2f541e74bc8e5.jpg"><br><br>  The SSD uses Toshiba‚Äôs memory; the controller is <br>  sealed with a company sticker.  But this is not a problem =).  As <br>  controller chip acts Phison PS3105-S5-1, a similar <br>  the solution is applied in the desktop SSD Patriot Torqx 2. It‚Äôs not to say <br>  That this is the fastest controller, rather a budget option. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/c3c/c66/78b/c3cc6678b1b266ff79b998ecc2a0e3d7.jpg"><br><br>  Wireless network controlled by Atheros AR5B97 module supporting b / g / n standards <br><habracut><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/fad/9b8/2a3/fad9b82a32f61180df62ed782342ee19.jpg"><br><habracut><br><br>  This is the reverse side of the motherboard.  Here you can see <br>  The remaining 4 RAM chips.  Next to the cooling system <br>  1 gigabyte of video memory is decoupled. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/53c/891/a34/53c891a346bd90d52e86d16c0c730cf7.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/7ef/e9b/d74/7efe9bd74a824784f265088674944829.jpg"><br><br>  For video memory, Hynix chips are used. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/13e/50e/c4f/13e50ec4f3e7c280dcb3d9179e30c672.jpg"><br><br>  The sweetest - the battery.  The output voltage is 11.1 V, <br>  capacity 4850 mAh.  According to Intel‚Äôs requirements, this battery should <br>  ensure the life of the ultrabook for at least 5 hours. <br><br>  Intel Core i5 2467M processor clocked at 1.60 GHz, in mode <br>  TurboBoost it rises to 2.30 GHz, and if not required <br>  use of resources - reduced to 800 MHz.  Physically <br>  dual-core processor capable of handling four data streams <br>  thanks to HyperThreading technology.  Processor Heat Pack - 17 <br>  Watt. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/538/63f/22f/53863f22f0517318a8f68fa95d12a739.png"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/b98/d40/2f7/b98d402f7e15bd049848ea8d3801732e.png"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/20c/874/0a3/20c8740a34d85ad1c4a1b4d20e1bbc95.png"><br><br><habracut>  Ultrabook video subsystem consists of two chips - a discrete NVIDIA GeForce GT 640M and integrated into the processor <br>  video core Intel HD Graphics 3000. When the power adapter is connected <br>  the user can work with the GeForce; <br>  graphics off, moving to integrated. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/e66/b4a/59d/e66b4a59db85576265537beb4afe7366.png"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/f4b/fbe/975/f4bfbe9753ff357bacefdd1a0f9f5e57.png"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/df1/00d/147/df100d1478247b38cdfed8790cdd43ec.png"><br><br>  RAM operates in dual channel mode at a frequency of 1333 MHz. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/99e/340/26c/99e34026c3f03bbe7a6090f69d9925c0.png"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/1b4/4bd/b1d/1b44bdb1d5062d8cf338040ac231e939.png"><br><habracut><br><br>  The disk subsystem consists of two parts - a regular hard disk. <br>  Hitachi and SSD caching disk.  Using Intel Rapid Start Technology <br>  This combination takes the ultrabook out of sleep mode in just two seconds. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/dae/248/d73/dae248d73e973eb29e632cf13f4a7851.png"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/b93/ad1/ab5/b93ad1ab54d7c26d5558756d58960da2.png"><br><br>  To assess the capabilities of the Acer Aspire M3, I drove a few tests. <br>  Let's start, as usual, with a built-in assessment of Windows 7. <br><br>  The weakest component is the graphics system, despite the fact that <br>  using discrete graphics.  Let me remind you that other ultrabooks <br>  estimates did not exceed 5.2. <br><habracut><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/648/c2f/399/648c2f39930e5f4d77302862b591888d.png"><br>  The speed of the RAM at a high level for ultrabooks. <br>  More only ASUS Zenbook UX31E (from those I tested for this <br>  moment). <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/2e4/4d2/0b4/2e44d20b459e04e05a5a076eaba2bd7c.png"><br><br>  But the speed of the hard drive frankly frustrating.  Reading and <br>  the recording of small blocks of 512 kB is difficult, yielding the same <br>  hybrid solutions in other ultrabooks. <br><habracut><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/814/cd9/98c/814cd998c9ea78d408596784e33671ae.png"><br><br>  Comprehensive assessment using PC Mark gave the following results: <br><br>  PC Mark 7 - 2294 points - this is not the highest figure.  Toshiba Z830 <br>  due to the use of "pure" SSD has a little big results, but <br>  compared to hybrid storage systems, the gap is <br>  400 points in favor of the Acer Aspire M3 - here affects discrete graphics. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/68d/749/2d2/68d7492d2854cdda2f5f801cf3d74367.png"><br><br>  PC Mark Vantage - 6131 point - the best result.  The performance of the system is at a high level, more dimensions would be more modest ... <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/dc2/0d8/173/dc20d81736964b4d65dd8068258782e7.png"><br><br>  PowerMark is more demanding than MobileMark 2007, so up to 5 hours <br>  Intel's ultrabooks fall short, but the result is general <br>  worthy.  HP Folio 13 managed to survive longer. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/874/368/3bc/8743683bc3a3737326c744e3c2d19bbf.png"><br><br>  "But my health is not very ..." (C) "Three of Prostokvashino." <br>  The temperature is high, if not critical.  76 degrees not for <br>  gentle male knees.  Of course, you need to understand what works. <br>  discrete graphics, but still would not want to feel hot <br>  surface when working.  The cooling system does not produce <br>  loud noise, or do not panic, or the fan is quiet. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/ce8/203/033/ce8203033b5421f48d2a48eb616fbdab.png"><br><habracut><br><br>  Final thoughts <br><br>  Large, heavy productive - but at the same time rather thin, with <br>  hybrid storage system, discrete graphics.  Acer Aspire M3 not <br>  makes an impression ultrabook.  What did you like?  Surely <br>  Diablo III game - settings can be set higher than <br>  than on integrated graphics.  Liked the fact that there is a digital <br>  keyboard.  I liked the design, which is sure to distinguish from the masses <br>  laptop users, but no one will understand what is in your hands <br>  ultrabook  I also liked the possibility of expanding the memory, though <br>  I did so - I soldered 4 gigabytes and left the slot free.  Price too <br>  I liked it.  In Yulmart device can be purchased <a href="http://www.ulmart.ru/goods/317571/">for 29,440 rubles.</a> <br>  Disliked: screen, very sad, especially after FullHD IPS matrix <br>  ASUS ZenBook Prime UX31A (its review will be on the other day).  Location <br>  power buttons (this is of course a personal niggle).  Having a DVD drive with <br>  tray, surely it would be better with a slot-loading.  Slow SSD. <br>  The ports on the rear panel are inconvenient, I often connect different flash drives. <br><br>  What's the rest: the controversial model that gave a start, probably <br>  dead-end, branches of "gaming ultrabooks."  So far, the example of Acer is not <br>  proved to be too contagious, although ASUS has already released the ZenBook UX32VD with <br>  GeForce GT 620M. <br><br>  Thank you for reading to the end, on this ultrabooks on the Intel platform <br>  Sandy Bridge is over, now ahead of Intel Ivy Bridge, AMD A10 and <br>  other goodies. </habracut></habracut></habracut></habracut></habracut></habracut></habracut></habracut></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/148691/">https://habr.com/ru/post/148691/</a></p>
