Experts in many countries are working to create an artificial mind that could surpass its creator.  Some scientists believe that AI is good.  Other specialists are afraid of a strong form of artificial intelligence.  Last year, businessmen, scientists, experts in the field of robotics and other fields signed <a href="http://futureoflife.org/AI/open_letter_autonomous_weapons">an open letter</a> , which warns weapons manufacturers from developing combat systems with 100% autonomy.  Among the signatories are: Ilon Musk, Stephen Hawking, Noam Chomsky, Steve Wozniak. <br><br>  Many aspects of the problem of artificial intelligence are displayed in the plot of a number of films, described in science fiction works.  According to scientists, it is necessary to solve emerging issues before the appearance of a strong form of AI, that is, now.  The largest technology companies, including Google, Microsoft, IBM are now working on the creation of artificial intelligence.  In order to prevent artificial intelligence from getting out of control, Google, Amazon, IBM, Facebook and Microsoft established an organization that will deal with various issues related to AI. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  This organization <a href="http://venturebeat.com/2016/09/28/amazon-google-facebook-ibm-microsoft-form-nonprofit-partnership-on-artificial-intelligence-to-benefit-people-and-society/">is called</a> Partnership on Artificial Intelligence to Benefit People and Society.  ‚ÄúEach new technology changes something, and such changes often scare people who do not understand them,‚Äù says the head of the artificial intelligence unit of Facebook [Yann Le Kun].  "One of the goals of this organization is to explain and show the possibilities of AI, to try to find questions on basic ethical issues."

      In June, the <a href="https://geektimes.ru/post/276838/">representatives of</a> Google <a href="https://geektimes.ru/post/276838/">told</a> about the need to develop a ‚Äúred button‚Äù, which the AI, who had run out of control, should stop.  Not the main organization, but a unit that deals with artificial intelligence.  DeepMind employees and scientists at Oxford University argue that AI is unlikely to behave all the time as planned by people.  And if something goes wrong, then there must be a means to solve this problem.  The ‚Äúbig red button‚Äù can serve as a guarantee of the possibility of interrupting the work of the computer system responsible for the work of AI, as well as to avoid the influence of artificial intelligence on people and the outside world. <br><br>  Even those scientists who are afraid of AI say that it is impossible to stop research in this area.  A more reasonable solution is to speed up the work on creating a system of control over AI.  The problem is that the development of a virtual mind involved thousands of people.  And the control system is developed by units.  But, as mentioned above, now representatives of the new organization <a href="http://www.partnershiponai.org/">Partnership for Artificial Intelligence to Benefit People and Society</a> have been added to this team. <br><br>  The project team will work in three directions.  The first is to strengthen existing and establish new connections between those people and companies who are engaged in the creation of AI.  The second is a collection of opinions on the problem of artificial intelligence in society and the academic environment.  The third is to inform the public about the progress in terms of creating a strong form of AI. <br><br>  Le Kuhn believes that the establishment of a dialogue between disparate teams of specialists in AI is necessary to continue successful work in this area.  Most of all, Microsoft, Facebook, Google and other companies have succeeded in creating a weak (so far - weak) form of AI.  If to unite their efforts, then work can become more effective.  There is, however, one concern.  Even if the group can reach agreement on a number of ethical issues, there is no guarantee that the principles developed will be implemented.  In other words, if one of the members of the organization decides to go against the developed ethical norms, no one will stop him.  The main task of the group is interaction with the public. <br><br>  <a href="https://geektimes.ru/users/bobuk">Grigory Bakunov</a> described the purpose of the new organization as follows: ‚ÄúFacebook, Amazon, Google, Twitter, IBM and Microsoft decided to unite and start collecting research and general practices for artificial intelligence.  What does this most likely mean in reality: a centralized bank, where each player will enter his piece of data, allowing even more to know about each individual, and the masses of people.  In modern AI, they are secondary, and the data and techniques for working with them are primary. ‚Äù <br><br>  The effectiveness of such an organization is in doubt with some scientists.  Kennesaw University philosopher Damien Williams [Damien Williams] says that simply bringing people together to work on AI problems is not enough to solve these problems.  Once the group is created, it must set new standards in the field of artificial intelligence.  Rules and regulations should be developed that can exclude the possibility of using AI for purposes that are hardly ethical.  But this is an extremely difficult task.  Although you still need to do it. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/372715/">https://habr.com/ru/post/372715/</a></p>
