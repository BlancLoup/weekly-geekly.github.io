Just today, 23 years ago, Linus Torvalds sent his <a href="http://www.thelinuxdaily.com/2010/04/the-first-linux-announcement-from-linus-torvalds/">famous letter</a> .  On this momentous day, I would like to please the Russian-speaking community by translating a collection of quotations, which, as it turned out, has not existed to this day in full. <br>  Under the cut - a storehouse of wisdom, sarcasm, irony and shoals of translation.  Welcome! <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  50. Now I am developing under Linux, before I wrote under DOS. <br>  Switching from DOS to Linux is like switching from a glider to an F117 fighter. <br>  - Lawrence Foard, entropy@world.std.com <br><br>  49. Beware of the Gate of Hell.  Switch to Linux. <br>  [: (Bill) Gates of Hell] <br>  - Unknown source

      48. I ran DOOM for the last couple of days more often than the last few months.  I love debazhit ;-) <br>  - Linus Torvalds <br><br>  47. Golly, Linux seems to be the best invention of mankind after sliced ‚Äã‚Äãbread! <br>  - Vance Petree, Virginia Power <br><br>  46. ‚Äã‚ÄãLinux is a great adventure for lovers of midnight hacking (and / or dialogs with the Lord). <br>  - Matt Welsh <br><br>  45. Linux is out of date. <br>  - Andrew Tanenbaum <br><br>  44. You are a professor and researcher.  That pretty damn well explains some upix moments in minix. <br>  - Linus Torvalds to Andrew Tanenbaum <br><br>  43. I still believe that the development of a monolithic core in 1991 is a fundamental mistake.  Rejoice that you are not learning from me - otherwise you would not have the high score :-) <br>  - Andrew Tanenbaum to Linus Torvalds <br><br>  42. We all know that Linux is great ... It performs infinite loops in 5 seconds. <br>  - Linus Torvalds about Linux excellence at the Amsterdam Linux Symposium <br><br>  41. People disagree with me.  I ignore them. <br>  - Linus Torvalds, about using C ++ in the Linux kernel <br><br>  40. Many people think that a fat penguin doesn‚Äôt really reflect the elegance of Linux.  As I understand it, they have never seen a angry penguin rushing at them at a speed of under 100 miles per hour - otherwise they would have chosen expressions more carefully. <br>  - Linus Torvalds, in the announcement of Linux v2.0 <br><br>  39. Is there a reason to use Linux instead of BSD besides a cool name? <br>  - Unknown source <br><br>  38. How do I know if it works or not?  For this there are beta testers.  I just got it. <br>  - Attributed to Linus Torvalds, somewhere in open correspondence) <br><br>  37. Troubleshooting Linux has never been as fun as AIX. <br>  - Pete Ehlke on comp.unix.aix <br><br>  36. And in general, Slackware sounds much cooler than Microsoft, isn't it? <br>  - Patrick Volkerding <br><br>  35. And the next time when you decide to complain that when you launch Lucid Emacs 19.05 via NFS on a remote machine on Linux in Paraguay, you have some kind of wrong background color - you will know who to thank. <br>  - Matt Welsh <br><br>  34. Deep Hacking Mode is a mysterious and frightening state of consciousness where Simple Mortal Users fear to step. <br>  - Matt Welsh <br><br>  33. * Sigh * I prefer to assume that Linux lovers are so eager to be on the cutting edge of progress that they fall from this edge into the abyss. <br>  - Craig E. Groeschel <br><br>  32. Microsoft, concerned about the growing popularity of Linux, a free 32-bit operating system for Intel, has assembled a team of high-class programmers from the underground world of virus development.  As Bill Gates stated yesterday, ‚ÄúWorld domination, and quickly - either we or Linus!‚Äù No comments from Mr. Torvalds. <br>  - rjm@swift.eng.ox.ac.uk (Robert Manners), on comp.os.linux.setup <br><br>  31. Who wants to remember that the super-edit-debug-compile mode is started by the escape-x-alt-control-left shift-b combination? <br>  - From the discussion of intuitive commands, especially in Emacs, on comp.os.linux.misc <br><br>  30. This is a plane!  This is a bird!  No, this is KernelMan - hurries to help faster than a bullet!  New kernel versions every 5 seconds! <br>  - Linus Torvalds, announcing kernel version 1.3.27 <br><br>  29. Those who do not understand Linux are doomed to recreate it.  Only worse. <br>  - Unknown source <br><br>  28. How does it turn off? <br>  - Linus Torvalds, updating linux.cs.helsinki.fi, after several months of continuous computer operation <br><br>  27. I came to the conclusion that using VMS is like hammering a nail with a forehead: of course, in time something will work out, but always at the cost of a headache and loss of blood. <br>  - Sean A. Simpson <br><br>  26.‚Ä¶ using Linux is like living in a house with a big family of carpenters and architects.  Every morning when you wake up - your house looks a little different.  A new turret appears, a wall moves half a meter.  Or someone for a while cleans the floor from under your bed. <br>  - Rob Riggs, in .sig <br><br>  25. If Bill Gates is a devil, then Linus Torvalds is a messiah. <br>  - Unknown source <br><br>  24. LILO, I'm in front of you on my knees! <br>  - David Black, dblack@pilot.njin.net, with apologies to Derek and the Dominos and Werner Almsberger <br><br>  23. Anyone can design a fast processor.  The trick is to design a fast system. <br>  - Seymour Cray <br><br>  22. Of course, no one forbids the use of symlinks ... Then syslogd will be a symlink on syslogp, and ftpd and ircd will be associated with ftpp and ircp ... And, of course, where is the final protocol penguin? <br>  - Kevin M. Bealer on the new Linux logo <br><br>  21. Multi-threaded file system - no more than a performance hack. <br>  - Andrew Tanenbaum to Linus Torvalds <br><br>  20. I did this because I‚Äôm getting dragged away from Linux, not because I‚Äôm getting paid for it. <br>  - Dave '-ddt-&gt; `Taylor, announcing DOOM under Linux <br><br>  19. This message is presented to you with the support of Linux, a free Unix. <br>  Windows without X is like having sex alone. <br>  Apples were a problem back in Eden. <br>  Linux is a way to get rid of viruses in autoload. <br>  - mwikholm@at8.abo.fi, MaDsen Wikholm <br><br>  18. Keep in mind that the killall name command may not have the expected effect on systems other than Linux, especially under an account with elevated access rights. <br>  - From killall man <br><br>  17. Backup to tape - for wimps!  The real men are uploading important things to ftp and waiting for them to go all over the Internet. <br>  - Linus Torvalds <br><br>  16. Linux is not user friendly.  He is user friendly.  He's no ignoramus or idiot friends. <br>  - Unknown source <br><br>  15. When you say: ‚ÄúI have written a program from which Windows has fallen‚Äù, people stupidly look at you and say: ‚ÄúHey, and I have these bundled with OSes, * free *.‚Äù <br>  - Linus Torvalds <br><br>  14. Want to travel around the world and speak at a bunch of different conferences - just write Linux. <br>  - Linus Torvalds <br><br>  13. Linux users - what are they, like lemmings, hopping from a sheer cliff of reliable, well-designed commercial software? <br>  - Matt Welsh <br><br>  12. Linux is an operating system with CLUE ... Command Line User Environment. <br>  [paragraph: CLUE here: main, key idea] <br>  - From comp.software.testing <br><br>  11. You see, to write a system like Linux is not enough to be a good programmer.  Must still be a cunning bastard. <br>  - Linus Torvalds <br><br>  10. What do you do if the documentation either contains no answer to the question you need, or is it obviously wrong?  In Linux, you say ‚ÄúLinux is crap!‚Äù And start digging through the sources.  In Windows, you say ‚ÄúWindows - shit!‚Äù And start hitting your head against the wall. <br>  - Denis Vlasenko about lkml <br><br>  9. ... so you can forget about celebrating the new year and spend the whole night in front of the computer, delving into a new and improved kernel version. <br>  - Linus Torvalds <br><br>  8. Linux hackers are funny people.  They measure time by patch versions. <br>  - Rob Riggs, in .sig <br><br>  7. Linux: Choosing the GNU Generation <br>  - ksh@cis.ufl.edu printed it on T-shirts in 1993 <br><br>  6. Not me, guys.  I read the Bash manual every day, like the Jehovah's Witnesses - the Bible.  Wait a minute, guide Bash AND there IS a bible.  I apologize‚Ä¶ <br>  - omp.os.linux.misc <br><br>  5. What does this script do? <br>  unzip;  touch;  finger;  mount;  gasp;  yes;  umount;  sleep <br>  Hint: not everything in the world is tied to computers.  Sometimes you lie in a sleeping bag in a tent next to your girlfriend ... <br>  - Frans van der Zande <br><br>  4. ‚ÄúI am an idiot.  At least, this bug was found in 5 minutes ... ‚Äù- It‚Äôs clear that Linus speaks about the degree of idiocy that many strive to achieve :-) <br>  - Bruce Perens in response to a Linus Torvalds letter about a bug in the core <br><br>  3 <br>  One OS to manage them all <br>  One OS to find them, <br>  One OS to build them <br>  And in salvation to bind them. <br>  In the radiant land of Linux, <br>  Where hackers frolic. <br>  - J. Scott Thayer, with an apology to the JRRT) <br><br>  2. ... Linux philosophy: "Laugh in the face of danger!" Stop, not so!  "Do it yourself!".  Here it is. <br>  - Linus Torvalds <br><br>  1. We use Linux every day, and our productivity has gone up the hill!  So would you go ..! <br>  - Joe Sloan, adaptation of the phrase Paul Paulsen <br><br>  Found a mistake in the translation?  Feel free to poke me into her face.  Let's make this translation better and more pleasant together - just in the spirit of Linux and all free software! </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/234517/">https://habr.com/ru/post/234517/</a></p>
