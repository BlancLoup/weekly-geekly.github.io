      In May of 2011, Facebook discovered a leak of confidential information about its customers and reported a crime to the FBI.  The Americans, in turn, reported to the British Scotland Yard, and on June 2, the hacker was arrested in the apartment of his parents, where he lived.  Police at the court noted that the search in the apartment Manghema cost a "lump sum" because they had to hire a number of highly paid specialists in the field of IT-technology, so that they figured out the removed material. <br><br>  "Ethical hacking" <br><br>  The student himself was preparing to become a specialist in software development.  According to him, he was just trying to identify the flaws in the Facebook security system and did not pursue any mercenary goals.  ‚ÄúEverything was done to identify vulnerabilities in the system so that I could prepare a report and pass it on to Facebook‚Äôs leadership,‚Äù said the defendant, speaking before the royal court of Southwark in London. <br><br>  A student lawyer called his client an ‚Äúethical hacker,‚Äù pointing out that Manghem saw a certain challenge in his actions and never tried to use the materials for commercial purposes.  Glenn Manghem, in proof of his good intentions, said that he had previously conducted similar hacking pages of the American Internet giant Yahoo. <br><br>  200 thousand to investigate <br><br>  The judge admitted that Glenn Manghem was not going to transfer or sell information obtained through hacking, but noted that the consequences of his act could be ‚Äúabsolutely catastrophic‚Äù for Facebook. <br><br>  ‚ÄúIt was not just an innocent experiment,‚Äù said Judge Alistair McCrit.  ‚ÄúYou have penetrated into the very heart of an international business system of colossal proportions and you must realize how serious this is." <br><br>  The York hacker entered the Facebook page of the employee and received internal data that were closed to outsiders while the employee was on vacation.  The hacker tried to remove the electronic traces of hacking, but Facebook experts still found them.  The company Facebook has spent on investigating the incident 200 thousand dollars.  In addition, the investigation required coordinated action by the US and UK investigative bodies. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/138475/">https://habr.com/ru/post/138475/</a></p>
