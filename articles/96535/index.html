  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Goal setting. Part 1</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"><h5>  Introduction </h5><br>  It is known that goals are big and small, farsighted and short-term.  Moreover, the large may well be short-term and vice versa.  But I would like to talk about the "goal-dream", as I call it.  What is it and why can it be useful for a person? <br><br>  We all definitely dream about something.  Someone wants to buy a car, someone dreams of moving to a new apartment, someone - about promotion.  If you run through the so-called ‚Äúwish-lists‚Äù of various users on the Internet, you can be sure that their dreams consist mainly of a single phrase.  This phrase, of course, is the key and gives an idea of ‚Äã‚Äãwhat the person wants.  But is this a complete enough representation? <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h5>  And now in order </h5><br>  Imagine we set a goal to go abroad.  Everything is clear.  Suppose we even chose a country and city where we want to move (Los Angeles, USA).  From now on, day after day, we will take certain actions to achieve it.  It is worth noting that with a clearly set goal, we, as a rule, do not make any additional efforts if they are not required to achieve it.  This is the main goal setting error. <br><br><h5>  The goal requires a description. </h5><br>  At first glance, a detailed description of the goal may seem to be a useless exercise, however, such a presentation is wrong.  Thinking about a goal, we have an image of her in her head, her result.  Usually, this is a colorful picture with a lot of details that, in the process of thinking, replace each other every second.  Here the dog is buried.  It is a fact that our short-term memory is capable of remembering on average up to 7 things.  That is why it is so easy to forget to purchase something in a store without having a list of products with you.  The same thing happens with the result of the goal.  The main result is always in the head, but the details are remembered, then forgotten.  Writing them down, you will not forget to take care of them.

    <h5>  The dream becomes reality </h5><br>  We continue to dream of Los Angeles.  At some point, we still moved there and immediately ran into difficulties.  Why so fast?  Because we did not dream of their absence.  It was worth dreaming not only about moving, but also that upon arrival we would be accommodated in comfortable accommodation for us in a good area, that we would live not far from transport, that we would have a favorite job, and not some for the first time that there will be a gym not far from home, if we prefer to play sports and so on.  Having set a "goal-dream" in front of you, you should describe all the nuances necessary for your comfort and for the result to be truly meaningful.  Only in this case, in the process of achieving the goal, you will make the necessary additional efforts, calculate many actions in advance and solve the upcoming problems before they appear. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/96535/">https://habr.com/ru/post/96535/</a></p>
