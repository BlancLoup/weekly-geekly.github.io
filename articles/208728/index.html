It so happened that in contrast to the peers who drove the ball in the yard or played computer games, I saved the money that my parents gave me for school lunch and went joyful to Vasileostrovskaya. <br><br><iframe width="420" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/5HDJXnmNFKc%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700022,15700186,15700191,15700253,15700256&amp;usg=ALkJrhg7EPXdPPYO2wWMlK-5vMZHDrnNJQ" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br>  Demonstration of the work of "smart home". <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  There I had two favorite places: the commission shop combined with the radio shop on the middle avenue and the flea market at the metro station.  At the flea market, ‚ÄúBOMZHEY‚Äù sometimes managed to grab a ‚Äúterrific‚Äù microammeter or scarce chips, and in the store there were transistors and other radio elements at ridiculous prices.  In the evenings I soldered, so that the in-depth course of my physics and mathematics gymnasium was given to me with difficulty.  They even wanted to drive me out a couple of times, but I was always ‚Äúwiggled out‚Äù.  At that stage, the ‚Äúpeak‚Äù of my creativity was achieved when I made a model of a machine controlled from a computer based on a matrix printer.  The Internet only then appeared - these were the years 1996-1997.  I mastered it on the basis of a free intranet pool from the Metrocom network.  Number even remember 303-9-303.  Computers, storage media were changing, the market was overwhelmed by ‚Äústunning‚Äù Chinese control schemes, which I could easily connect to a computer using parallel or serial ports.  USB - was still just coming into vogue, so the first scientific work at the St. Petersburg Polytechnic was done on the basis of this ‚ÄúChinese‚Äù.  And then there was a ‚Äúbreakthrough‚Äù from Velleman, which was called K-8055.  This scheme was introduced by me wherever possible and impossible.  It had analog and digital inputs-outputs and allowed to manage complex machines, as it had the ability to cascade up to 4 circuits.  It was already a full CNC.  I poured them with melted wax and, in this form, they still work in 30-40 places even at low temperatures.  I wrote programs for them in C ++ and Delphi very quickly. <br><br>  After the institute, after working for a couple of years in the office, I was puzzled by the issue of automation and the organization of a smart home within my apartment.  I had two ways AMX and Crestron.  I chose AMX.  I will explain why.  In 2011 I automated one cottage in Moscow and its owner presented me a panel MVP-8400i.

Back view <br>  1. Control the light.  It's all very simple.  If dimming is not required, then a relay is put in place of one of the continuous switches - so you can turn it off if it was turned on and on if it was turned off.  If dimming is required, then a digital-to-analog converter is ‚Äúhung up‚Äù to the com-port of the AMX controller and we are already controlling the dimmer from it. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/e6d/027/e09/e6d027e096bdc93d252119ff8ce87ae6.jpg" alt="image"><br>  Relay and dimmer control hidden inside the bottom plate <br>  2. Air conditioner-TV projectors and other infrared nonsense.  On the controller for this case there is a whole bunch of IR-ports.  There you hang an infrared diode, read the command from the ‚Äúnative‚Äù console, program it and wear it in your hat. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/ecd/22b/bc2/ecd22bbc23a0b460488118286e18d382.jpg" alt="image"><br>  Infrared LED is hidden inside the internal unit of the split system <br>  3. Water - normally open and normally closed valves.  I used Chinese.  A cool thing is first and foremost: do you go from work on a cold January evening and want to go into a hot bath and enter the apartment ... Go to the site of the ‚Äúsmart home‚Äù and turn on the bath filling.  Valve open.  The bath is filling up.  The valve closes. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/85b/ffb/185/85bffb185c9c2173c84c43a62fb3d0a2.jpg" alt="image"><br>  Electromagnetic valve and shemka with LED indication <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/1e5/fbc/b83/1e5fbcb83eade42be72849d2e98a541f.jpg" alt="image"><br>  Circuit with LED display and relay unit <br>  4. Underfloor heating, ventilation and control of the coffee machine: see point 1 without dimming. <br>  I will immediately mention that I have implemented video surveillance, so the effect of lighting a light bulb for thousands of kilometers is fueled by the ability to look at it via the Internet (remote video surveillance system), so go ahead!  AMX taxis !!! <br>  For those who are in the tank: the control panel - communicates with the Wi-Fi access point, then the access point is wired to the controller.  The controller sends a signal to a transistor, for example, which amplifies it to the level perceived by the relay, and the relay already switches the final circuit, for example a fan or a light bulb.  The controller has a web interface, so you can stick it out on the Internet for entertainment outside the house. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/c91/b6f/02d/c91b6f02d85c2769a29a651188a4a961.jpg" alt="image"><br>  Internal communications <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/808/0e5/56b/8080e556b16a250125bc03e09bbacf35.jpg" alt="image"><br>  Communication relay output of one of the controllers <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/124/638/0bf/1246380bf43f47f10443785722c374ad.jpg" alt="image"><br>  Power supply relay and valves <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/738/fdd/15e/738fdd15e07aca5f3efb9c0eafa6ad27.jpg" alt="image"><br>  Actuating AC Relay for use as a three-phase galvanic isolation <br>  Recommendations: <br>  1. If you are set on fire with the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãa smart home before an overhaul in an apartment - go for it.  After - postpone this idea until better times; <br>  2. Games with electricity are bad, water is doubly bad, so if you are not a professional, do not hesitate to consult with ‚Äúcompetent‚Äù specialists; <br>  3. Think about how the system will behave if you find yourself without electricity for a long time; <br>  4. The budget of ‚ÄúSmart Home‚Äù on high-quality equipment - significantly exceeds 100,000 rubles, so do not get involved in such a venture, without being financially ready; <br>  5. The time spent on the project and discussion is about a month, another month on the scheme, so that after finishing it didn‚Äôt work out, ‚Äúbut the wiring is not enough,‚Äù well, and the work with the soldering iron on the implementation.  I did my system for about a year for financial and temporary reasons. <br>  6. I did not mention the soldering iron accidentally.  Only him and the POS-61, for example.  No terminal blocks, especially twists.  Think above all about the safety of what you are doing. <br>  7. Recommended manufacturers: <br>  a) Controller and control panel: AMX vs Crestron <br>  b) Video surveillance: Axis vs D-link <br>  c) Power supplies: MeanWell <br>  d) Network equipment: Cisco Systems <br>  e) High Frequency Cable Equipment: Netko <br>  f) radio details muRata <br>  g) Power cables: Sevcable <br>  h) Switches, dimmers, sockets, circuit breakers: ABB <br>  i) If you are using a computer inside the system, then in no case use Windows.  Ideal QNX, valid Ubuntu. <br><br>  Successes. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/208728/">https://habr.com/ru/post/208728/</a></p>
