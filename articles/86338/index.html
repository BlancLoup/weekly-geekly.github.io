  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Minsk StartUp Weekend: New Perspectives for IT Projects</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  In April 2010, the third Minsk Startup Uikend will take place, which, unlike the two last ones, will be entirely devoted to business projects in the field of IT technologies.  The event is non-commercial and represents a one and a half day training marathon, a business run-in and launch of new business ideas - start-ups and attracting investment in them.  In this process, the authors of ideas and start-ups, beginners and successful entrepreneurs, experts and investors simultaneously participate.  For a day and a half, they are together looking for ways to launch business projects quickly and efficiently. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  The participants, with the support of experts and investors, work out their project, form their own team and test their leadership skills.  In case of success on the StartupWiki, the authors receive the support of numerous partners of the event, investment proposals from investors, a lot of additional opportunities for the development of their business. <br>  As the experience of previous Startup UIkandov shows, even deeply developed projects during the event are often completely transformed.  Sometimes the authors even refused to receive investments and decide to develop their innovative business in an evolutionary way.  This happens because not every project needs investments in the form of money.  Many people need intellectual investments, they need support, they need partners, a team.  But you can understand this only by checking your project with a meeting with the real market - represented by investors and experts. <br>  Not every beginning businessman can prepare a competent business plan for the realization of an existing idea: someone owns worse marketing, someone - finances.  We are learning to solve all these questions in the format of a business simulation at the Minsk Startup Week. <br>  Within the framework of the weekend, it is possible to present even a ‚Äúbare‚Äù idea.  Then, having received feedback about the interest of investors, the practical feasibility of the idea, you can determine the concept, make initial financial calculations, get advice and ‚Äúpackage‚Äù your project in the form that will be most convenient for investors. <br><br>  Any interested person who has a business practice and is ready to spend his weekend to gain experience and investment in a personal project can take part in the event.  Ideal generators, managers of various levels, project managers, engineers and technical specialists in the field of IT and web technologies, marketers, financiers, designers, as well as people with a critical mindset, imagination and entrepreneurial acumen are most in demand. <br><br>  In the program "IT" Startup UIkanda: <br>  - presentations of IT projects in Elevator Pitch format <br>  - feedback from experts and investors <br>  - formation of teams on the job exchange <br>  - work on projects in teams with the assistance of practicing business consultants <br>  - negotiation with investors tete-a-tete
