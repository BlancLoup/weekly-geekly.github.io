  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Robbers use the game world of Pokemon Go to lure a potential victim to the right place.</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  The recently presented Pokemon Go game with elements of augmented reality managed to attract the attention of not only ordinary fans to have fun, but also very clever intruders who found a non-trivial way to use the capabilities of the new Niantic project for personal gain.  More information about the announcement and the "problems" of Pokemon Go with the law, we will tell in this publication. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/f3e/de5/280/f3ede5280d2cec6b2e8a71efd07bf845.jpg" alt="image"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  For those who are not familiar with the game world Pok√©mon Go for completeness, briefly recall what, in fact, it is. <br><br>  The development of the multiplayer game Pok√©mon Go was carried out jointly by the companies Nintendo, <a href="http://www.pokemon.com/us/about-pokemon/">The Pok√©mon Company</a> and Google startup, the company <a href="https://www.nianticlabs.com/">Niantic</a> .  The latter took an active part in the creation of the AR game <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details%3Fid%3Dcom.nianticproject.ingress%26referrer%3Dai%253DCtH-hDpCEV4qPG8mZzAO457eYB8fjhuoF96jS21Ct17C9XggAEAFgpfajhowjoAH5_NTcA8gBAaoEJE_QxrZQ7Nx-80b-e28qGuhDiYTOQlm5S2kwSb0et7SambbtsYgGAbAGAYAH74KrI5AHA6gHpr4b2AcB%2526gclid%253DCODc6fun7c0CFUrncgodXuEF2g%2526conv%253D999636601">Ingress</a> and it is felt in the game world of Pok√©mon Go.  The game includes elements of augmented reality and takes into account the location of the user.  In the story, the players can track, capture, train Pokemon and even fight with them in a real environment.  Despite the fact that the Pok√©mon themselves are visible only on the screens of mobile devices, thanks to AR-technology, their invasion is expected on the streets of parks and squares of cities around the world.  The game is distributed on a free basis, but it also provides access to microtransactions with payments from $ 0.99 to $ 99.99.

He contacts the user Pok√©mon Go Plus using Bluetooth, LED backlight and vibrator.  In the event that something significant happens in the game, for example, an "abandoned" Pokemon appears nearby or a serious mess is planned, the device will notify the user with vibration and light notifications.  Pok√©mon Go Plus is not a required attribute of the game, but with its help the player will be able to significantly reduce the time spent behind a mobile device.

Almost immediately, Pokemon Go topped the lists of the most popular free mobile apps in the App Store and Google Play Store. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/237/b31/f71/237b31f71d979c57372d93ee7c24e962.png" alt="image"><br><br>  Niantic developers are not going to rest on their laurels and plan to further develop the project.  Recently, the head of the company, John Hanke, shared with journalists that in the near future, players will be able to sell pocket monsters with like-minded people, as was the case in Gameboy times.  The ability to trade pocket monsters regardless of the platform is one of the traditional features of the franchise, which is one of the auxiliary ways to achieve one of the main goals - the collection of a complete collection of animal-like creatures. <br><br>  In the future, developers plan to expand the AR component of the game and provide players with the opportunity to use devices like Microsoft HoloLens.  Thus, today, almost immediately after the announcement, Pokemon Go looks like a very successful project that opened up new possibilities for the cult universe to its users. <br><br>  <b>A drop of tar</b> <br><br>  New and attractive opportunities for themselves in connection with the announcement of Pokemon Go considered and attackers.  The police department in the small town of O'Fallon, Missouri, <a href="https://www.facebook.com/180316078675503/photos/a.262124017161375.70607.180316078675503/1272368709470229/%3Ftype%3D3%26theater">published a</a> report on four robbers organizing armed attacks in St. Louis and St. Charles. <br><br>  According to the police, the criminals searched for their victims among the participants in the Pokemon Go game, after which they lured them to a convenient place for the crime and committed an attack.  In the list of affected teenagers are 16-18 years old, living in the above cities.  According to the official statement of law enforcement officers, in order to lure the victim to the right place, the robbers marked Pokestop (the real place on the city map where you can pick up in-game content) and today this scheme has been used for robbery 11 times. <br><br>  Obviously, the developer Niantic Labs and the publisher Pokemon Go were not ready for such a scenario, which does not mean that the search for a solution to an unexpected problem can be postponed for an indefinite future.  The global international release of the game has been postponed, because interest in Pokemon Go turned out to be higher than its creators had expected and, as a result, the servers could not bear the load.  It remains to hope that by the time of the global launch this trouble will be eliminated and fans of the cult universe will no longer suffer at the hands of lovers of easy money. <br><br>  It should be noted here that attackers from St. Louis and St. Charles are not the only unpleasant problem associated with Pokemon Go.  Last week, in the course of the next chase for the pocket monster, the girl player came upon a dead body, and the guy filmed an attempt on his own life.  In the latter case, there is a high probability that everything will cost. <br><br>  <i><sub><a href="http://thenextweb.com/us/2016/07/11/careful-armed-robbers-lured-victims-using-pokemon-go/">TNW</a></sub></i> <br><br><hr><br>  That's all with you was Dronk.Ru.
