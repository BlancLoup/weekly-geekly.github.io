  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Windows Phone - squeeze out all the juice</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"> This is a post about the current state of Windows Phone with a set of "additional" programs installed, available right now on custom devices.  I will try to talk about functions and applications that, in my subjective opinion, many do not know.  I will not nudge 3 pages about each checkbox, but just briefly go over everything that seemed to me interesting and little known. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/506/7a6/e45/5067a6e457e5bc31df87c9e55e124bd3.jpg"><br>  Under the cut a lot of pictures and some text. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Let's start with the device itself - in my case it is the <b>Samsung Omnia 7</b> . <br>  At the same time, there is a firmware from Nokia, with windows phone 7.8, so I have such an interesting about screen. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/674/e75/ca1/674e75ca1962422ae3f48eeb6b71f53f.png"><br><br>  <b>one)</b> <br>  And here is the miracle of miracles, squares of various sizes!  New start screen is the same!  He, however, has become much more convenient.  But much more difficult to set up.  Since  Tiles come in three sizes, sometimes there are funny situations when there is a hole in the collection of these razornosize tiles and there are not enough ‚Äúfavorite‚Äù applications to close it.  Frankly, setting up a new main menu took me probably an hour and a half ... While I was twisting it all, changing it, and rearranging it.  As a result, I decided to use the smallest tiles as a bandwagon band.  For example, 4 small tiles with the weather.  Or 4 small tiles with different mails.  But I feel that this is still not an ideal arrangement, I still have to twist :) <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/ff9/b60/0a2/ff9b600a2895d236a3e2296792cd98ac.png"><br><br>  And this is how the weather looks like: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/6af/451/8c7/6af4518c7ba4cc2b38fdd0beafb540ec.png">

      Big people, just for example: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/eee/fc2/82b/eeefc282bf47eb15e942eea5d935f991.png"><br><br>  And this is a list of all applications.  As you can see, nothing has changed here, except that the green bezel has disappeared around the letters on which the application names begin.  So for now the reason why all presentations do not show anything further than the home screen is a mystery. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/14d/cf8/4cd/14dcf84cd1316640290e3eee12f02c95.png"><br><br>  <b>2)</b> <br>  Many WP users had a problem, and many have, and many more laugh for it with WP - they say it is impossible to manually configure the APN.  Maybe.  Nokievskaya Network Setup copes with this on my old Samsung. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/613/fc9/28b/613fc928bed8e26f6325af5ab06dd43e.png"><br><br>  <b>3)</b> <br>  Emergency and Broadcast cellular network messages?  We know how ... But bad.  Well, nothing, soon learn. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/c98/57e/d25/c9857ed2567a50d2d66347c2622fceb6.png"><br><br>  <b>four)</b> <br>  Windows has a problem - nothing seems to be fixed, but the whole memory was devoured by someone or something.  I myself wondered for a long time where she went.  It turns out the case in the cache of unfair applications.  It is treated by the cache cleaner program. <br>  Once I cleaned the cache thoroughly, I released 1.5 gig :) <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/173/caf/624/173caf624b11068ab6e549a3ddd7fcb3.png"><br><br>  <b>five)</b> <br>  This thing allows windows to connect to the mobile device center of Windows and get a nostalgic shock. (Http://support.microsoft.com/kb/931937) <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/b32/625/1ed/b326251edcb4d5399ab9004cba9bf3d1.png"><br><br>  <b>6)</b> <br>  Yes, windows background can also be rebooted or turned off without pressing the hardware buttons.  For many, this is somehow important.  OK. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/c12/605/3c2/c126053c22438ac87810bb5d6bc9fbb2.png"><br><br>  <b>7)</b> <br>  The type of battery can be changed to different little pictures with percentages.  Just like big ones. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/1f1/8db/bcd/1f18dbbcd11bca4f02f2d54097c92f5c.png"><br><br>  <b>eight)</b> <br>  The file system can also be browsed.  True, I would not advise you to delete anything ... But you can. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/5ab/365/464/5ab365464df8b31982724f3876325677.png"><br><br>  <b>9)</b> <br>  Well yes.  Yes!  You can transfer files via bluetooth.  Unbelievable, but it is a fact. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/1f1/592/5da/1f15925da85221397a7baf4370a55a75.png"><br><br>  And you can also receive files.  By bluetooth.  Everything gets better if you add bluetooth to it.  More applications can be transferred and set yourself.  Just like the heyday of JavaME. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/715/73c/860/71573c860b3bf2a8087487c61ebff089.png"><br><br>  <b>ten)</b> <br>  Of course there is internet sharing.  It turns out that many do not know about it.  The truth is that many do not have it.  :) But, in general, he is, yes. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/672/ef2/ba2/672ef2ba274e8a742af27752f76fd541.png"><br><br>  <b>eleven)</b> <br>  Exclusive applications?  Nah, this is not our way.  Although, more or less interesting is only for Samsung, Nokia and htc.  The rest is slag. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/c7c/6e2/69f/c7c6e269ffc926db437b8cfeaee7bcf9.png"><br><br>  <b>12)</b> <br>  No albumart on some albums in the collection?  All scan, find all, albumarty will be in place!  And it will be beautiful. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/2c1/4f4/4b3/2c14f44b372687bcbd90b7fdc82a83c7.png"><br><br>  <b>13)</b> <br>  Counters traffic, calls, sms.  Apparently they mixed up the minutes with seconds, but these are trifles.  Do not forget that this is a beta, this is the Nokia firmware on the Samsung and the Nokia program. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/bd4/ab0/1e6/bd4ab01e6e074d887bf7fae0258e756a.png"><br><br>  <b>14)</b> <br>  Many have complained that there is no possibility of turning off the phone‚Äôs position sensor.  Because of this, for example, lying on one side, reading sites is problematic, because  Landscap included.  There is such a feature.  Probably one of the most frequent pieces that I use and which by default is very lacking. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/980/bec/de3/980becde3eac0a0b5d0be8d771994f0a.png"><br><br>  <b>15)</b> <br>  You can turn on glonass, which I have never had in my phone.  Nice, but useless. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/123/ce0/389/123ce03896480cb4396fbc71ddfbf70f.png"><br><br>  <b>sixteen)</b> <br>  What windows without regedit?  Everything is in place.  We use, we change the keys, <strike>hard reset</strike> . <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/132/656/acc/132656acc34c4b96a35f5fc10678efc3.png"><br><br>  <b>17)</b> <br>  We give selected applications root access.  By analogy with android.  Type security and all that :) <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/25d/765/d11/25d765d118840ec96647707a4bbf877b.png"><br><br>  <b>18)</b> <br>  And this thing transmits the image from the phone to the PC.  Slowly and glyukavo, but these screens are made from him. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/80b/4ff/16a/80b4ff16afe0adcaed3c4cf2d0c01d73.png"><br><br>  <b>nineteen)</b> <br>  Many have the problem of accidentally clicking on the search button, which is generally quite useless.  This is especially annoying during the game when the favorite bing pops up in the middle of a responsible mission.  Hurray, now you can just turn off this button.  Well, or another thread that is useful for her to hang.  Joy. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/541/668/dad/541668dad629f0e4d6ef04f257e80097.png"><br><br>  <b>20)</b> <br>  Imagine, even SMS can be backed up: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/383/61e/f1c/38361ef1cf9241ad80ec03584ece2241.png"><br><br>  Yes, right in the cloud, on skydrayv. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/444/1ae/59d/4441ae59d37dcf1796da541048331f60.png"><br><br>  <b>21)</b> <br>  Many for some reason think that in windows backgrounds you cannot configure static ip.  Well, before it was.  But now everything is possible, voila: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/4bc/ee7/abe/4bcee7abe6e76fef9aa1585635bb6ad9.png"><br><br>  <b>22)</b> <br>  Topics.  How many topics do not add, but still use green. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/f39/fc6/c92/f39fc6c9242dec03e539ac67a46b474c.png"><br><br>  Here is a variety of colors: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/eb0/04e/f04/eb004ef049ec1b0954c7f06bafecb559.png"><br><br>  <b>23)</b> <br>  High technology in action on the example of Translator.  Included in the post, because this feature usually produces a wow effect. <br>  It was like this: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/8b4/b6a/fc2/8b4b6afc25eab86692e9184edbe1c09b.png"><br><br>  They thought it over, podnuzhilis, focused the camera and it became so: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/43a/5fa/0cf/43a5fa0cf8b05f75d07dff4356aa71c7.png"><br><br>  Of course, this is not all. <br>  For example, I did not tell about the wonderful program LockWidgets.  It allows, instead of wallpaper, to show the charge of the battery, wallpaper with Bing, the weather.  Unfortunately, I just didn‚Äôt have it when I took screenshots, but the program is and works.  Or how convenient it is to listen to audiobooks on windows background ... <br><br>  I hope it was interesting and you learned something new for yourself. <br><br>  PS The name of all programs from the post - at the top of the screenshot.  If it is not there, then this is either part of the OS, or I wrote the name in the comment to the picture. <br><br>  PPS As always, I ask comrades minus to reinforce their indignation with comments! </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/153175/">https://habr.com/ru/post/153175/</a></p>
