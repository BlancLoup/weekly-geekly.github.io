Then, other people who want to help with registration indicate the locations in which they regularly live (work, study).  If the one who disappeared gets into the user's location, then a notification is sent to him that in his area then, someone has disappeared.  If the user has seen him, he can send additional information to the one who posted the loss. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Users who want to help, do not indicate any personal data, they can specify a full name, to refer to them by name, and be sure to indicate the places where they live.  This will increase the entry threshold. <br><br>  The user placing the loss on the contrary, indicates the maximum information, all available communication channels, etc.  To him, in which case it was possible to contact promptly. <br><br>  In the event that two users who want to help to find, indicate areas close to each other, they unite and the information transmitted about what he saw, there and there, comes to the second user as well.

    <h4>  Purpose. </h4><br>  <b>To help people make up for their loss.</b> <br><br><h4>  Obvious problems and their solutions. </h4><br>  <b>How to attract to the site of those who have not lost?</b> <br>  <b>1. Geo social networks</b> (including dating), where the user himself personally indicates, or transmits information about his location.  These parsitsya and through this service through a bot offer to participate in the project, only in cases where a person is missing in his area (no one talks about engaging in spam). <br>  <b>2. Tying on events</b> .  Other social networks in which the user says "I will go", is tied to the places to which the user will go and again, through this service, he receives a notification. <br>  <b>3. Placement of information of the audience, which is prepared</b> - forums of dog breeders / koshkovod. <br>  <b>4. Creating an API and attracting geo-social networks.</b> <b><br></b>  <b>5. Creating applications for social networks.</b> <br><br><h4>  Monetization. </h4><br>  Monetization can be built on two principles. <br>  <b>The first</b> is ‚ÄúThey don‚Äôt earn money on someone else‚Äôs grief‚Äù, this is all kinds of charity on the part of those who were helped to find the loss. <br>  <b>The second</b> is ‚ÄúPaying for service‚Äù, a cash entry threshold for those who are going to find someone, or payment for providing information (worse). <br><br>  It is important to note that the one who seeks earns nothing.  Therefore, user fraud will simply not be possible. <br><br><h4>  How can you strengthen the project </h4><br>  - To interrogate the investigative bodies that are engaged in the search for people who can give advice on the search, or report on some typical mistakes.  In addition to the quality of the service, it will play an important role in the usability of the service. <br>  - To interrogate people who searched and found <br><br><h4>  It is important to note </h4><br>  The faster the response to the loss, the more likely in hot pursuit to find a person.  In my opinion, the way the system works now is just awful. <br><br>  <b>What do you think are the strengths and weaknesses of this project?</b> <br><br>  Follow @ <a href="http://twitter.com/degravia">degravia</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/80606/">https://habr.com/ru/post/80606/</a></p>
