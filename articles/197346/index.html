      (This is just an experiment) <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  The governments of the Earth united and created a special subdivision of scientists who worked day and night in order to give a second chance to all mankind, in case the Earth is covered with a copper basin.  A new type of engine was created, which allowed fast enough to move at a super-light speed.  Planet Earth received lighthouses and began sending expeditions to nearby planets and systems.  In the vicinity of Betelgese (Yes, in general, it does not matter which star) a planet was found suitable for human life. <br><br>  Without hesitation, the Earth gathered a couple of expeditions and began a project on terraforming and colonization.  A group of biologists with a couple of millions of tons of cargo was sent to the planet.  The guys quickly got down to business and created a habitable biosphere on a new planet.  The local atmosphere is almost completely consistent with Earth.  After a couple of years, plants and many animals were adapted to life.  Cows, pigs and other cattle were brought to the planet.  Of course, the party of cats was sent with great honors in a separate ship.  The planet is ready for life. <br><br>  After much discussion, they decided to name the planet ‚ÄúThe Second.‚Äù  (Either Forty Two, or 10, or whatever you like).  Although the people of the planet became known as "stock". <br><br>  A warp tunnel was established to carry cargo.  Here it is, in front of us in all its glory.  There is an atmosphere, a biosphere and a couple of thousand colonialists on the planet.  After a couple of days of discussions, a visa regime has been opened and a provisional government has been established.  On the planet there will be 4 large states, one for the mainland.  Permission was granted to create new states.  The government of the Earth is concerned about the colonization of the new planet.  Everything is good, but so far on the Spask one can only make fires and watch the sunsets (and they are beautiful there).  It is necessary to adjust the infrastructure and prepare the planet for settlement. <br><br>  The reserve rotates and does other things that are appropriate to make a habitable planet.  The turnaround time is approximately equal to 30 hours of Earth time.  The slope of the axis is about 7 degrees, the climate is temperate, with no pronounced seasons.  There is a concept of spring and autumn, although there is no winter as such.  Revolution around the star - 307 days. <br><br>  Special qualifying contests were held to determine who can build the infrastructure.  You are lucky, you have won one of these contests and now you can offer your idea, which you will realize on a new planet. <br><br>  Welcome. <br>  Your task is to create a normal communication infrastructure that will allow you to transfer some of the existing communication systems and computer systems to a new planet.  At the moment, we at least need the following: <br>  Navigation system <br>  The communication system that will allow you to create the Internet <br>  Communication system that allows you to communicate. <br>  Monitoring systems for time, speed, various indicators. <br>  System of work with objects in the cosmic space of the planet <br><br>  Your ideas will be heard and considered by the Committee for the colonization of the Second (CCA). <br><br>  How do you lay the cables? <br>  How do you imagine a GPS system or something like that? <br>  How will the Internet be arranged? <br>  What to do with the classes responsible for the date and time?  How do you count time? <br>  Maybe you have ideas about the means of transportation? <br>  Or are you worried about the environment?  Then what energy sources will you use? <br>  What to do with the synchronization of time and coordinates? <br>  Or do you really think that you need to create a universal language? <br><br>  You have absolutely zero project.  Kommitov have not done.  Submit your ideas in the comments.  I would like to know what YOU would like to realize on Earth if you could do it.  It will be interesting to me to hear your most insane ideas about how to do something from the very beginning. <br><br>  I beg. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/197346/">https://habr.com/ru/post/197346/</a></p>
