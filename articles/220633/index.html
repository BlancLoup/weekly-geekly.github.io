As a result of the comments, the hypothesis of explosive integration efficiency was confirmed.

      <i>So, colleagues integrated MoySklad with popular engines of online stores, telephony, 1C: Accounting.</i>  <i>Integration is absolutely necessary, because cloud services (at least, good ones) are highly specialized.</i>  <i>In My Store, for example, there will never be a built-in storefront for an online store.</i>  <i>Instead, we give the opportunity to work with all the popular engines.</i>  <i>The same applies to other areas - we do not do bookkeeping or telephony, but simply give the opportunity to connect to the best products that solve these problems.</i> <br><br>  The conclusion is obvious - you should not reinvent the wheel, but you just need to take the best and integrate! <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br><h5>  Visionary games ‚Äî if not limited to the integration of 1 + 1, you can see that the trend of business management already lies at the junction of the application itself and ‚Äúcorporate Siri‚Äù with the foundation of specialized databases or knowledge and their use from different devices </h5><br><br>  The habit of working with different devices or multi-screen work has become a familiar part of the work of a front office employee, a company manager or a public servant.  Today Working with multi-screen business applications - smartphone, tablet, desktop, laptop This fact imposes a number of restrictions on the ability of each device to work with an application - usually via a smartphone we do not have access to all the functionality of the application. <br><br>  The main advantage of mobile applications is their availability ‚Äúhere and now‚Äù, a significant disadvantage of mobile add-ons is incomplete functionality and different from the ‚Äúparent‚Äù application - in most cases it does not repeat the logic of desktop applications and employees spend time learning to work with an actually new solution - this is the main a problem that hinders the development of mobile add-ons (applications) among managers or front-end divisions of a company. <br><br>  The integration of SaaS services is when 1 + 1 = 3.  SaaS services will add to each other through the API and this leads to sometimes surprising results.  And not only complement, but also give services unique properties and competitive advantages, for example, ‚Äúconscious‚Äù voice input-output data. <br>  As mentioned above, the mobile application is in general a story that is not similar to the parent application, but rather its simplified and not similar to the original derivative and, ideally, the developer needs to ‚Äúteach the dog of Durov‚Äù to speak and understand vk, incl.  through voice. <br><br>  And we intuitively see that a possible solution for adapting corporate solutions to mobile devices is to use some intermediate options that lie at the junction of the corporate application functional, the intermediate module for processing application commands and their voice input / output.  For example, voice command input or event notification in <a href="http://quickme.ru/">Quickme.</a>  on the one hand, the mobile device should receive commands from the corporate application (system events), ‚Äúunderstand‚Äù them, and on the other hand, transmit these events to the user and receive feedback in the voice command format. <br><br>  In simpler terms, the corporate segment of applications needs its own ‚ÄúSiri‚Äù, which broadcasts the event of the corporate application to the user, understands its voice command, and performs the only correct action among the many options at the level of the corporate application or knowledge base of the application.  As a result, we received an interesting task of organizing communications of a corporate application and a mobile device without the usual ‚Äúpush-button‚Äù interface, but through.  for example, an avatar with which it is visually more familiar to communicate, and which will be able to replace 38 buttons of a mobile application and become the center of decision making - prompting the user and not just the converter of the application command to voice and back. <br><br>  <i>To date, we have found one domestic solution that can ‚Äúunderstand‚Äù the work of corporate applications and manage them through mobile devices - this is the Kubukla App Talk platform ( <a href="http://kubukla.ru/">www.kubukla.ru</a> ).</i>  Kubukla App Talk (a solution for integrating SaaS services with mobile devices) is an avatar that can use the API to ‚Äúunderstand‚Äù the events of your corporate application, process the user's voice commands, and enter voice commands to the application side.  In fact, the <i>Kubukla App Talk will</i> additionally or completely replace the mobile interface of your corporate application. <br><br><br>  <i><a href="http://quickme.ru/">Quickme</a> interface and any corporate application is not the same</i> <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/19e/226/ce7/19e226ce7945945ffd8442ef52a0a468.gif" alt="image"><br><br>  <i>Stands can easily communicate with visitors to museums or supermarkets.</i> <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/1cc/1bd/441/1cc1bd441a66d985852aec0b84daac6f.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><h5>  The result of the integration of the Kubukla App Talk and the <a href="http://quickme.ru/">Quikme</a> mail system: </h5><br>  ‚Ä¢ Voice mailbox management - send to get mail <br>  ‚Ä¢ Sound mode of familiarization with incoming correspondence <br>  ‚Ä¢ Event scheduling - meetings, appointments, reminders in the calendar. <br>  ‚Ä¢ Voice dialing letters <br>  ‚Ä¢ Choice of action on the received event <br>  ‚Ä¢ Event Notification <br><br>  In general, an avatar can transmit any event of the corporate system - reminder, ticket, receiving e-mail, scheduled calendar event, task priority. <br><br>  In fact, an avatar may well become a universal mobile device interface for one or all corporate applications used in an organization.  There are all prerequisites for this: <br>  ‚Ä¢ today, most corporate applications are implemented on mobile platforms, which de facto becomes the standard - a pattern of user behavior has been formed <br>  ‚Ä¢ mobile applications are under-supplied and live their own lives - look at the same FB. <br>  ‚Ä¢ enterprise applications migrate to the clouds <br>  ‚Ä¢ The work logic and architecture of most management applications are the same. <br>  ‚Ä¢ Application API is wide and available. <br>  ‚Ä¢ there is no comprehensible help system for choosing the right action solution in the form of a voice menu. <br><br>  Possible examples of Kubukla App Talk integration are CRM, Task Manager, e-mali, DOCflow, Project Manager, Service Desk.  Hypothetically, the Kubukla Platform can be used without an avatar with the original interfaces of mobile applications that support the user's dialogue with the databases and receive indifferent answers from them - a city or place guide, a support service (alternative channel), a guide, a site or database guide. <br><br><h4>  What in the world?  Integration of SaaS platforms and queuing systems (company sites). </h4><br>  So far, the main main channel for processing client requests is call centers.  With a tool for optimizing the work of the call center operators - IVR  In fact, IVR is an element of self-service in call centers, which allows you to unload the expensive time of work of operators.  In addition to calls, there are other channels of operator interaction with customers, chat, SMS, e-mail, and so on. <br><br>  Relatively recently, a new opportunity to automate the processing of client requests appeared - these are virtual assistants - one of the Kubukla platform implementations capable of taking on self-service, similar to IVR, has a speech and text interface, helps unload contact center operators, reduces company costs, improves the quality of company services in general. Let us consider an example of the implementation of a similar self-service system from Nuance.  The virtual assistant bears quite Russian name Nina. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/119/55e/a1c/11955ea1c34dfae2d4cbaac66761ce25.gif" alt="image"><br><br>  Nina uses technology to understand natural language.  It is clear that this is still far from clever artificial intelligence, but for the conversational level of customer service is enough. <br>  So at the end of last year, the Australian company Jetstar introduced the Nuance ‚Äúcubicle‚Äù to its website <a href="http://www.jetstar.com/">www.jetstar.com</a> . <br><br>  Jess, the so-called character, can give out information in the form of a chat booking about luggage and places.  In the first five days, Jess handled 77 percent of all requests. <br>  Jetstar has launched a pilot project in Australia, further implementation is planned in New Zealand and Singapore, Japanese and Chinese versions are also planned. <br><br>  A recent Nuance survey found that 58% of consumers cannot solve their problems on their own through the companies website, despite all their efforts.  71% of consumers will use a virtual assistant on the Internet if he can get their correct answers.  Similar solutions are already used in companies such as Michelin and Wind stream. Virtual assistants are easily integrated with existing CRM systems. <br>  References: <br>  <a href="http://www.nuance.com/landing-pages/products/nina-web/default.asp">www.nuance.com/landing-pages/products/nina-web/default.asp</a> <br><br>  In the article, I tried to consider 3 integration examples - combining the functionality of several independent applications, integration that changes the way of interacting with a b2b application and leads to the emergence of visualized I / O interfaces at the dialogue level with the application and using SaaS queuing platforms (as an alternative to IVR) using the example Nuance solutions. <br>  The next step for the "dog Durov" <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/70b/bb4/67a/70bbb467a7d3403e0ab7387aa8c988d9.jpg" alt="image"><br>  The process of creating an avatar in the studio I-LIFT.TV <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/0ea/c60/9e9/0eac609e973b2804966a6f7983cd99cb.jpg" alt="image"><br>  While "he understands everything" and will soon speak! <br><br>  The article did not analyze the possibilities of integration with automation platforms of cloud providers (this was done earlier and contrived, in my opinion the concept of single sign on system in terms of integration. <br><br>  <a href="http://www.bootstrap24.ru/">Blog author http://www.bootstrap24.ru/</a> <br><br>  Materials series "How to create and earn on SaaS" <br><ul><li>  <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/quickme/blog/216421/">Part I / remove all unnecessary, hit the target, experiment</a> </li><li>  <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/quickme/blog/217283/">Part 2 / invaluable experience of Russian ISV</a> </li><li>  <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/quickme/blog/217281/">Part 3 / sales through an affiliate channel that may not be needed</a> </li><li>  <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/quickme/blog/218873//">Part 4 / Startta Quickme - communication and collaboration of small teams</a> </li><li>  <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/220633/">Part 5 / Ubiquitous SaaS integration, how nice the threat is to the rest of the software business or how 1 + 1 turns into 3</a> </li><li>  <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/221553/">Part 6 / Quickme story for partners or 7 reasons to do things together</a> </li><li>  <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/quickme/blog/222401/">Part 7 prefinal / why not sell SaaS?</a> </li><li>  <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/quickme/blog/225561/">Part 8 - FINISH / SaaS - the realities of the Russian market</a> </li><li>  <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/quickme/blog/231099/">Accidentally forgotten Part 9 / Legal Fog SaaS</a> </li><li>  <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/quickme/blog/229543/">Part 10 / Business Model Metrics</a> </li><li>  <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/236991/">Part 11 / Cloud Services Reviews / UX and Usability Testing</a> </li></ul></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/220633/">https://habr.com/ru/post/220633/</a></p>
