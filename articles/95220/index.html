  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Shtetl "Pionernet" eyes of technology</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"> Good day Habr! <br>  After reading the blogs of Telecoms and IT infrastructure, I was surprised that there are very few articles.  Moreover, everything is more about slightly dishonest methods of taking money from the population and the economic aspects of work ... It would seem that the infrastructure is the backbone of the industry, but there is no information.  And I was completely surprised - I didn‚Äôt find anything - not only about the ‚ÄúProvincial Providing‚Äù, but even about the capital. <br>  Therefore, I decided to write about my work experience, problems, pitfalls and their solution, technology, and the development of the provincial ‚Äúpioneer‚Äù. <br>  The day was a day off, I was honored to write, it was not a revelation, of course, but a look from inside the industry, and a person. <br>  Who cares, we will try to respect the traditions of the community, welcome‚Ä¶ <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  In 2006, after studying a chemist for three years, he took the documents, since  I realized that the soul does not lie.  He went to his native city (~ 250-300 thousand people), entered the evening department of the ACS, and got a job as an installer for the local provider Kolkhoz Telekom as they are contemptuous, and sometimes deservedly called by the people. <br>  The network, when arranged, was a small Ethernet optical star with a bunch of copper branches from each ray, and several islands of 3-5 houses in remote parts of the city, connected by a radio link.  Everything is minimally smart, most often the planet WGSD1022 and WGSW2840, or even stupid equipment, without a hint of redundancy. <br>  I never complained about my hands, head and pendant language, so when I came to the office once again for salary, I was taken aback by the offer to transfer to technical support.  Technical support did not take long to sit either.  After about a month of work I was transferred to the technical department. <br>  At the moment, my responsibilities include fiber welding and machine maintenance, configuration and maintenance of switches, internal network servers and subscriber routers, maintenance and repair of the radio access network. <br>  For the fourth year I have been working as an engineer, at the same time receiving both practice and education. <br>  While working, the network grew from 1.5 thousand home and 200 corporate clients, to almost 7 thousand home and a half thousand corporate.  The network was practically rebuilt on FTTB (Building), internal cabling, instead of the front one, and access / aggregation / routing equipment from Dlink. <br>  And about problems, pitfalls, solutions: <br>  Part One: Personnel, State, Citizens. <br><br>  1. The staff. <br>  Maybe somewhere in the expanses of our Motherland, in regional and metropolitan cities, installers are working disciplined and competent people who know what cable they pull, how to handle it, and what requirements the equipment has for working conditions.  Often, one had to deal with 360 degrees bent over, or even optics cut deeper than insulation.  Boxes installed in booths on the roofs of houses, in which in summer +60, in winter -30.  Twisted pair squeezed into the shield next to the power cable. <br>  This problem is constantly being solved.  The appointment of responsible foremen to raise the quality of work did not help.  The introduction of a partial piece-rate payment, fines for marriage, and outfits for the remake of the hack, too. <br>  We began to go to the acceptance of the critical work of the installation service, to fix the people who carried out specific applications, entered the warranty period - if within a month from the moment of installation / repair the line fails, the crew that performed the previous work goes to repair it, and the restoration is not is paid. <br>  At the moment, the quality of work can be called acceptable.  On average, 40-70 applications per month, 3-5 cases of marriage. <br><br>  But with discipline and work schedules complete horror.  Any team can turn off the phones in the schedule among the schedule and arrange for 2-3 days of a spree.  Then they come, they write explanatory messages from the category ‚Äútransport has broken down,‚Äù and they continue to work.  When they paid little, the unofficial rationale for such liberties was ‚Äúwe are not paid so much‚Äù.  When they began to pay more + they introduced a piece of paper, another argument appeared: ‚Äúdofig money, ¬± a couple thousand is nonsense, you can relax.‚Äù <br>  How to deal with this we think so far, apparently we need to feel the Russian provincial soul.

      The personnel problem concerns also engineers.  I am grateful that there are very few good IT specialists in provincial cities.  Only due to this, the drop chemist was able to get practice, training in work, skills and, most importantly, incomparable experience.  Become an engineer in the shower, and soon on paper. <br>  The reverse side of the coin - there are only four competent technicians in the company.  Technical director, programmer, designer and me (the cable man is a hardware worker).  We would be happy to hire a couple more people, but they are not.  Two interns of evening students are now undergoing an internship.  One is likely to settle in tech support, and I hope to teach one to weld the fiber and maintain the machine in order to completely withdraw into iron, the amount of which is only growing ... <br>  The solution to this problem is not yet visible. <br><br>  2. State. <br>  The state is primarily bothering in the form of new housing legislation, which, in fact, resulted in local self-government, and in some places even the tyranny of the HOA and management companies, with a multivariate interpretation of the law. <br>  We, almost everywhere, are periodically denied access to the technical premises and communications of buildings under verbal / written instructions from ‚Äúolder by 2 square meters of attic,‚Äù or operational engineers of UK Yesterday Were Open. <br>  The issue is resolved in most cases peacefully and lawfully.  Recently we have entered into agreements, according to which all equipment installed on houses is transferred after installation to the common fractional ownership, the tenants use it, and we are involved as a service organization.  This removed a lot of problems, but sometimes the principal and the senior still force us to sue two or three times with the involvement of interested clients by a third party before believing the court and agreeing to issue the keys. <br>  Several times because of the urgency, we were forced to cut off the existing locks, and afterwards we had to sue the interested parties.  Sometimes conflicts even reached the call of the police to the place of work ... <br><br>  Due to the refusal to cooperate with the management companies and the opposition of the elders to their homes, we had to abandon the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãmaking our pipe risers and cross-connection boxes in the house entrances, like some of our competitors.  I do not know how companies that managed to carry out their pipes acted, but we were told that there would be no permission until we submit a project, technical expertise, fire examination, lots of approvals with companies that commissioned houses and operate them now ... <br>  In general, it was decided to lay the cable system in low-current pipes of power supply panels, i.e.  in existing technological communications.  After the fact, the decision was controversial, but generally successful.  It did not bring us any legal or serious operational problems, and is successfully used at new points of presence. <br><br>  A lot of anxiety brought us the city committee of municipal property, which a year ago ‚Äúpresented‚Äù the pillars of the quarterly coverage of a private firm.  A firm without warning set the price for the rental of pillars 5 times higher than that approved in the contract with the municipality and asked for money. <br>  It was necessary to urgently transfer an insignificant, but critical part of the network to the surrounding facilities, and in some places dig in their posts, which also resulted in a solid minus to the budget and reputation of the network, since  Because of the urgency of the work, important objects were idle for several days. <br><br>  3. Citizens. <br>  Citizens are a separate item of expenditure.  Often considerable.  It is not about customers, but about the attitude of people to property.  Including the property of their neighbors. <br>  The program for the overhaul of the housing stock initiated in 2006 by the state is a major headache that lasts for the fourth year. <br>  People involved in the repair of soft roofs of high-rise buildings have a definitely barbaric mindset.  Cut off all that is fixed and burn all that is chopped off - the main task. <br>  The problem is solved in many ways.  The main optical cables are placed as compact and high as possible, the plants in the room are organized at the maximum distance from the soft roof.  House communications descend from roofs and facades to attics, and into panels.  Where this is not possible, special remote fasteners (often manufactured by special order) are used to remove the cable system beyond the reach of flamethrowers and axes. <br><br>  In houses, the cable system of which is laid on the plates, occasionally incidents occur and the cable insulation melts and the pairs are closed.  Most often from cigarette butts, which neighbors extinguish shoving in the open shield.  There were also cases of theft of a twisted-pair house and a number of active equipment located in shields. <br>  Countermeasures are limited to calling the installation team, which hangs a lock and a sticker with a phone number on the door of the dashboard if someone suddenly needs it.  A small branch is usually locked, in which there are no counters. <br><br>  With the theft of active equipment managed just removing it from the shields.  Replaced with a multi-pair cable, which in parts is interconnected directly to customers.  Of course, the measure is fraught with cable theft, but it was noticed only 3-4 cases, and then in houses of ‚Äúcommon‚Äù type, which are traditionally bad with security, and the switches disappeared from there almost by drawers. <br><br>  That, in general, is the main part of our problems, as regards the organizational part of the activities of the provincial provider.  All these four years were filled with efforts and work to make a good, albeit developing, but stable and promising network out of the ‚ÄúCollective farm of telecom‚Äù.  and it seems as long as we cope with it.  At least Stream and Beeline Wire aka Corbina, which came last year, did not frighten us or our subscribers. <br><br>  I will definitely write about the technical part: migration from copper to fiber, combinations of various construction and reservation schemes, conflicts in the operation of heterogeneous equipment, real problems of network growth and number of subscribers, the rise of several internal network resources and assistance to initiative users in their organization, and I also mention something ... <br><br>  I don‚Äôt know how interesting it is, I just want to write and save solutions that I liked by my efficiency, and in some places and elegance.  It may be useful in the future and not just me ... </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/95220/">https://habr.com/ru/post/95220/</a></p>
