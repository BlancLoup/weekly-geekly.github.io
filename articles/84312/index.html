For our birthday, we invented, drew and printed the game of Magvaepolia based on Monopoly on our own.  3 weeks passed from idea to implementation.  The game is tested, exciting and unusual.  But first things first. <br><br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/c11/697/ca7/c11697ca75395bc911965b618bd93069.png" alt="a game"><br><br></a> <a name="habracut"></a><br>  We prepared in advance - ordered the camp site, made a list of dishes and, of course, came up with something to have fun.  And the most important entertainment in our studio is board games.  We started recently, but immediately retracted.  The first time they played a kind of monopoly with a fantasy slant - I liked it so much that they decided to make their board game - Magvaepolia.

      As you remember, in a monopoly, you need to buy / sell real estate (sectors) and take tribute from players who fall into these sectors, and you can build objects in sectors and the cost of sectors increases.  We did it by analogy - only instead of real estate famous studios.  Total got 22 studios.  Each had its own value, for which it was possible to buy it.  The cost is very different from the real) <br><br><br><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/158/a2d/dcc/158a2ddccf28807a4b4286c6193c3649.png" alt="a game"><br><br><br><br>  Initially, players start as freelancers - i.e.  do not own any of the studios.  Also, players at the start of a zero portfolio, no employees and 10,000 bucks in the account. <br><br>  In the course of the game, you can buy studios, build departments in them (only 4 departments - a design department, a programming department, a sales department and an administrative department) and departments. <br><br><br><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/f7c/604/67a/f7c60467ab889a51cc0c0e7359f74e1a.png" alt="studios"><br><br><br><br>  You can also receive orders - earn money, portfolio, hire employees.  Orders are large and not very divided into customers and top customers.  The second come with a full portfolio and a sufficient number of employees.  Just like in life <br><br><br><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/31c/2ce/c6b/31c2cec6bfc35dff65213e42bca217df.png" alt="customers"><br><br><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/f82/eb7/972/f82eb79727a3396244ea0e3da0101884.png" alt="customers"><br><br><br><br>  After completing the order in addition to the above bonuses, you can get a chance for success - earn money, get a plus to work or hire more employees.  If the order is failed, then you need to pay the cost of the order to the bank and go on vacation - think about why it did not grow together and make plans for the future. <br><br>  The chance of success - a card that increases your chances of winning, gives good bonuses.  The chances are different, big and small - these are embellished life cases - from selling to another studio and transferring its portfolio to you free of charge to raising karma in Habr√©. <br><br><br><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/2c5/557/62d/2c555762d4baeb6984a4b7db25a3db43.png" alt="chance of success"><br><br><br><br>  But, as in life, there are failures.  Sometimes there is a financial crisis. <br><br><br><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/7e1/a20/680/7e1a20680425046ac36912417cb2236f.png" alt="financial crisis"><br><br><br><br>  which leads to inevitable problems in business <br><br><br><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/b48/ad2/837/b48ad28374dc0f76793d00a339968bb9.png" alt="Problems"><br><br><br><br>  Problems in business are failures that await inexperienced freelancers and novice studio managers.  This is when you have so little money, but here, unexpectedly, the labor inspectorate decided to visit your office or your favorite project manager persuaded the designer and programmer to open his studio.  Yes, such work troubles entail financial losses and personnel losses.  After such a difficult to recover morally, but the game continues <br><br>  By the way, some bonuses of chances of success will save from such problems.  I remember exactly, the neighbor in the game was not tortured by tax and other checks - he had protection.  Here in life so I would get a card and live peacefully. <br><br><br><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/560/e94/e8d/560e94e8d5c99c79d133a546c673d5b9.png" alt="panacea for checking by state agencies"><br><br><br><br>  But the most important thing in any studio is its employees, people who make all the complex mechanisms of the site creation process work.  Employees are different - different professions and with different salaries - they can be bought at the labor exchange <br><br><br><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/171/24d/78c/17124d78c29d03e563150136529dabe0.png" alt="labor exchange"><br><br><br><br>  And they can come themselves - to get a job after a successful order.  By the way, their number affects whether you will get an order or not - large customers have high requirements. <br><br><br><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/dbd/004/973/dbd0049735892be5988d657d03a109e1.png" alt="here are our specialists"><br><br><br><br>  And by collecting a real studio of 6 different specialists, the player receives a bonus of 10,000 green.  We made money specially for the game, our own) <br><br><br><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/9bf/0f4/1b9/9bf0f41b9e5f72bc8fba963639f56003.png" alt="money"><br><br><br><br>  In general, we tried to make an exciting board game that does not disagree with our life of site developers.  There is everything that we live.  The game was designed and implemented by the studio management.  We all printed on the last day, because the printing house, which on Tuesday received all the sources of the game, on Friday still did not launch the printing press.  Therefore I had to negotiate with my friends - a small printing house, where they print no more than A3 size.  But nothing - everyone printed them out, pasted the picture of the field onto the cardboard, cut out the cards and money and got the game, no worse than those sold in the store.  We finished our epic with a seal at 1-30 at night, congratulated each other on their birthday and went to sleep, and at 8-00 we went to the country to try out our creation.  Thanks to him, 4.5 hours were spent in the heat, fun and friendly team.  What could be better?) </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/84312/">https://habr.com/ru/post/84312/</a></p>
