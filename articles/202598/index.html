  <section class="page js-page"><h1>About bitcoins and money</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  In light of the recent stormy debate about taking a new $ 500 bitcoin rate, I want to share my thoughts on why bitcoin is not needed. <br>  Since I am not a real economist, I picked up a mask at a construction site - I will be grateful to the comments of those who understand the question better than me. <br><br>  So why do we need money? <br><br><h4>  1. As a means of calculation </h4><br>  Instead of direct exchange of goods - it is convenient to enter into transactions using an item that is <i>needed by everyone</i> and therefore can be used by the seller for subsequent purchases. <br>  Need may be caused by the subject‚Äôs own qualities: for example, no one in the modern world would refuse a gas canister;  and in films about the Chechen war, ammunition between actors is a tool that is absolutely necessary for any of them. 
      <br>
        <script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>
        <ins class="adsbygoogle"
          style="display:block; text-align:center;"
          data-ad-layout="in-article"
          data-ad-format="fluid"
          data-ad-client="ca-pub-6974184241884155"
          data-ad-slot="8945601208"></ins>
        <script>
          (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
        </script>
      <br>
      A more common option in the modern world is when necessity is caused by the <i>belief</i> that everyone else needs this item as well.  Not a single merchant will refuse American dollars, not in one country of the world - not because the USA is special, but because every merchant knows that every other merchant from him will accept these dollars in exactly the same way. <br>  Such a belief in American dollars has been formed historically, and only one can shake it - the spread of merchants who <i>refuse</i> to accept dollars. <br>  When the online bazaars have ads "change your bucks for bitcoins, and then come" - then the bitcoins will become wealthy as a means of settlement. <br><br>  But while merchants accept bitcoins <i>along</i> with dollars - it does not matter, a thousand such merchants exist or one hundred thousand, all the same: why bother with conversion, if you can not bother and buy immediately for dollars? <br>  In the meantime, it is difficult for me to imagine an entrepreneur who sells something legitimate and, moreover, who refuses to sell it for dollars.  These are? <br><br><h4>  2. As a means of accumulation </h4><a name="habracut"></a><br>  If I save for something expensive, then it will not be as convenient for me to store gas canisters as, say, gold bars of the same total value. <br>  And it is even more convenient to store small pieces of paper with the inscription ‚Äúthe bearer of this will be given gold bars on demand.‚Äù  These were the first dollars. <br>  And it is even more convenient to keep one piece of paper with the inscription ‚Äúthe holder of this account will be issued small pieces of paper in the amount on the account‚Äù.  Or use for this magnetized piece of plastic.  This is the form most modern ‚Äúmoney‚Äù has. <br><br>  Is it convenient to store bitcoins? <br>  If something happened to the computer (fire, deluge, invasion of hackers with Winkers), I lose my bitcoin wallets. <br>  Honestly, paper notes have the same drawbacks.  Well, that's why we keep money in banks, not under mattresses. <br>  And bitcoin, it turns out, returns us to the financial middle ages - and, like in the middle ages, ‚Äúwhoever dared, he ate‚Äù: they hijacked coins - there was no one to make a complaint, I had to watch better myself. <br>  Well, like the anonymity of the calculations - get it. <br><br>  The other side of the question about the convenience of storing bitcoins is the uncertainty of their value. <br>  In order not to happen, as with the Soviet sberbooks: ‚Äúfor those bitcoins that I have put aside my whole life for a car - buy cakes for children‚Äù. <br>  As long as bitcoins remain basically a means of speculation, not a means of calculation, their value will still jump up and down, not tied to anything concrete. <br><br><h4>  3. As a means of speculation </h4><br>  Securities have always attracted human attention by the fact that there are many different ones and they all change their value in different ways, which means that you can be welded to their exchange and resale. <br>  Economists argue that stock speculation is useful in that they redistribute funds in the most favorable way for the market as a whole.  The essence of this boils down to the fact that every dollar won on the stock exchange - someone loses;  those.  funds are redistributed from more naive participants to more cunning ones. <br><br>  I myself treat speculators in the same way as poker players: it is clear that the result depends heavily on skill and on luck, but you need to have a very specific character to choose this as a source of permanent income.  Personally, it was enough for me to lose my then two-month salary on the game with shares in order to lose any kind of hunt for this occupation. <br><br>  How do pyramids of all kinds of Mavrodi differ from ‚Äúreal‚Äù actions?  Especially from shares of IT-type Facebook bubbles, which have almost no assets in the material world?  And how does bitcoin differ from all this? <br>  I think that nothing, and that just this niche bitcoin successfully occupied, eclipsing both emememy and forex. <br>  Gambling people have always been, now they have a new high-tech toy. <br>  But let's not call it a substitute for money. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/202598/">https://habr.com/ru/post/202598/</a></p>
