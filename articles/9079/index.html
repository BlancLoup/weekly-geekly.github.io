With his arrival, the ‚ÄúSupa‚Äù team strengthens its marketing component and strengthens the company's international positioning. <br><br>  Earlier this month, Benjamin Wegg-Prosser resigned as director of strategic communications for Tony Blair, as the head of the British government announced his retirement at the end of June.  As part of his work on Downing Street, he was responsible for many important projects, including highlighting the Prime Minister‚Äôs activities on the Internet.  Thanks to the efforts of Benjamin Wegg-Prosser, an electronic petition service was launched, which services have been used by more than four million Britons since April 2007, and Tony Blair‚Äôs first video message appeared on the popular YouTube resource that was viewed about a million times.  Note that Ben's boisterous activities were not liked by everyone in the government.  He was even <a href="http://politics.guardian.co.uk/egovernment/story/0,,2015248,00.html">called an idiot</a> , which was widely discussed in the British press. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Prior to his appearance on Downing Street, Benjamin held various senior positions in the British Guardian newspaper, which is famous for its pro-Russian position.  His most recent position is publisher of the Society Guardian application, the most profitable section of the publishing house.  In addition to this, he launched a number of projects designed to expand the exploitation of the brand and become reliable sources of income for the publishing house. <br><br>  In Supe, Benjamin will be responsible for marketing and marketing research, developing the company's brands and strengthening its corporate reputation.  <i>‚ÄúThe tasks offered to me were so interesting that I could not ignore the invitation.</i>  <i>Since the creation of the company "Soup" has advanced far ahead.</i>  <i>Now is the time to move on and from the launch phase move to a new level, where the main priorities will be increasing revenues and increasing the number of service users.</i>  <i>I am pleased to take part in building a business that I believe will take a leading position in Eastern Europe.</i>  <i>In recent years, I have had the opportunity to learn and love Russia, and today I am glad to become part of the Soup team</i> , ‚Äùsaid Benjamin Wegg-Prosser.
