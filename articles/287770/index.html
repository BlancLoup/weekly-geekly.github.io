      Apart from the fact that the last issue of the best newspaper in Scandinavia ‚ÄúComputer News‚Äù was 666th, then today is the main holiday of the year!  How are we going to celebrate the anniversary?  Glav.red.  I offered to go skiing in Silichi, but for some reason I don‚Äôt really want to go in the summer.  Oakley insisted on holding a large-scale press conference, and Christopher wanted to hold a music festival with at least Massive Attack and other Depeche Mode.  But I will modestly drink a glass of kefir and surrender to memories. <br><br>  The very <a href="http://crazyhamster.livejournal.com/156021.html">first review</a> appeared in the KV on November 10, 2005.  It all started with the fact that I gave links only to the original articles of the authors of blogs and a brief description of them, a kind of review.  With some changes, this approach has been preserved to this day.  The emphasis was on stand-alone blogs, but with each release of reviews I began to realize that there are not so many interesting blogs, so you need to search for blog services like livejournal, blogspot, dirty.ru, and so on and so forth.  I admit that initially I treated all blog services with disdain.  Considered that a separate own blog on your own domain and purchased hosting will by default be better than the same one, but somewhere in LiveJournal.  Later it was understood that content is important in blogs.  That is, design, interface and other fashionable pribluda nobody needs if the blog is not interesting.  So when you have something to say to the world - do not bother with the technical and comparative characteristics of blog engines.  Get your diary on any service known to you and begin to enslave the world. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a>  There was a feeling that my reviews differed little from the Hot Links heading.  Especially since there were coincidence of links.  That is why I wanted to add more ad-libbing to the text, the author.  Still, blogs are such an informal way of expression, and if you make the reviews as serious as possible, the charm will disappear.  And the idea to do reviews came by itself.  I was absolutely not satisfied with the reviews I read: when a link is given and five words of description.  I wanted to, and I have always strived and will try to make the reviews absolutely self-sufficient.  So that the reader would enjoy reading, and the usefulness or interestingness of the links were only a pleasant addition to the text. <br><br>  Of course, there were some funny moments in 50 issues.  For example, a <a href="http://kv.by/forum/forum2005460604.htm">story about a miner</a> , when my sense of humor misfired.  Or trying to set me on the right path and begging me to <a href="http://kv.by/forum/forum2006020601.htm">stop reviewing blogs</a> .  Constant confusion with the numbers of reviews, when after the 17th came out the 15th or twice in a row the 8th and 11th.  There were several times <a href="http://kv.by/forum/forum2006050604.htm">invasions of hypocrites</a> and delights that were pleasant to me about my <a href="http://kv.by/forum/forum2006420602.htm">return</a> .  Yes, I remember everything, I read all the comments and get inspired by new achievements from your feedback, letters.  And it does not matter whether they are positive or negative, the main thing is that they exist! <br><br>  A separate paragraph is worth mentioning letters from readers.  Yes, they write, ask, are interested.  Periodically there is a hotline for blogs, when I almost live answer your questions.  But the funniest letters from those who want to get on the pages of the newspaper, that is, that their blog was in the review.  Naturally, these are beginner authors, who feel that writing a letter to me is almost a 100% condition for getting into the review.  Even if you don‚Äôt even take into account that they mostly appeal to you, and the letter looks like this: ‚ÄúHi dude, write about my blog in the newspaper!‚Äù (Dear editor, do not correct mistakes).  Attention!  By writing me a letter with such a request, even without errors and not on you, you get a 100% chance that your blog will never get into blog reviews.  I review all the blogs and links using only the internal random number generator (and random letters if I can‚Äôt plagiarize someone else‚Äôs text), and such letters frustrate me and cause concentration.  In my blog (the link to which is always at the end of the article) I periodically conduct surveys for my articles and must publish interesting answers and links to the respondents.  Here's a great way to get into the review!  And I only advise Rollton from a saleswoman in a tight lump to beg, especially with such a boorish frenzy.  Send links to other people you like blogs, you can with your own comments.  I read such letters with pleasure and always answer them.  Also, they will surely be entered into the ‚Äúfavorite‚Äù letter folder in verses, especially if the verses imitate Twisted or Northerner.  I like to communicate with readers, so I met a lot of interesting people in absentia.  And how pleasant it was at the award ceremony for the best content projects to hear from the audience: ‚ÄúOur hamster‚Äù.  There are several small ideas and one global one for the further development of the Reviews.  But, as blogs are dead without readers and comments, so these reviews periodically require stopping, rethinking. <br><br>  So, last summer after the 25th review, I took indefinite leave and did not publish reviews.  Sometimes you get the feeling that I‚Äôm always typing the same thing, so in time, the desire to take a mini-interview from people who are related to blogs or blog services has come.  Yes, blogs are now just a huge amount, but really interesting diaries, where people show themselves, their wrong side, their talent - less than a percent of the total.  And I have to, as a nightman in rubber boots, wade through the ocean of shit to the islands of talent.  Yes, yes, I fully agree with you that I actually have not earned any authority to listen, read and find my advice useful.  Yes, that's all true.  I just have a taste and a beautiful syllable that gets gloss after adjusting for Larisa Mintel.  And Sergey Poznyak, who patiently holds a place in the room for each review and does not swear when I cheat him again with deadlines, and which to my cries: ‚ÄúNobody needs these reviews!  This is a wonderful text for toilet paper! ‚ÄùSays wearily:‚Äú I‚Äôve been working in a newspaper for 13 years ... It‚Äôs almost impossible to change something in my work to feel as if in a new business.  In the fight for content, I find diversity.  I am like a vampire - I eat someone else's energy.  Eternal themes and forms do not exist.  And all HF shny long-livers should have died long ago.  Many have died.  One thing remains the same - information.  So the interests and formats are things that cannot be conserved.  I think you need to do exactly what is interesting ... "But I am interested in all this!  I am interested in people, it is interesting to read their thoughts, especially if they are the exact opposite of mine.  And I‚Äôm interested to introduce you to these people.  And, thank God, we all have a choice: you have to read or not to read, and I have to write or not to read. <br><br>  <strong>Lesha Kaletsky</strong> <br><br><table cellpadding="2" cellspacing="2" width="789"><tbody><tr><td> <strong><font>I read blog reviews ...</font></strong> ... tamu what I can do is pinch out pasta and great rosies for blog, plus me padabaetstsa smilty artisan, I'm not a padabezza, but I don‚Äôt have any skin notes, I‚Äôm not a skin number, I don‚Äôt padadzetstsa, I‚Äôm not a skinniest blog post, I don‚Äôt use skin, I‚Äôm not a padabeztsa,  Eryk <a href="http://kontrabaser.livejournal.com/">kontrabaser</a> <br>  ... because there is not always time to read your RSS feed, and the review is all the most important and so it is written!

There are more than enough such ‚Äúguidebooks‚Äù on the Internet, but the ‚ÄúKV‚Äù review is a fairly objective look at the blogosphere from Belarus.  The author of the review copes with its task, in general, but it would not hurt to add (without comments) to the list of interesting blogs and posts sent by readers and previously moderated by Mr. Khaletsky to the list of his links.  As they say, two eyes are good ...
