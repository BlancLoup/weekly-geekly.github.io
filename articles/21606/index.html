Without your help, we would hardly be able to go that far.  The list of new features and errors found was quite voluminous, but it was completely implemented.  However, the article is not entirely devoted to this. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a>
      <br>
        <script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>
        <ins class="adsbygoogle"
          style="display:block; text-align:center;"
          data-ad-layout="in-article"
          data-ad-format="fluid"
          data-ad-client="ca-pub-6974184241884155"

      <br>
      Initially, I wanted to write a regular announcement, talk about new features: the emergence of a <a href="http://webo.in/my/">personal user account</a> , the <a href="http://webo.in/my/action/history/">history of site checks</a> and some other ‚Äúgoodies‚Äù compared to the gamma version.  However, these are all external attributes.  Most of all, I just want opinions and advice from the public, in what way they see the service: how convenient it is for them to use, what opportunities I would like to see more, and how they see the future of such services. <br><br>  If you look back 10 years ago, then you could only dream about the layout by standards, the object code for the web was mainly written by only Java programmers, and the search engines worked on a couple of weak servers.  Now, of course, everything has changed.  Has changed dramatically: the integration of all-with-all has already firmly entered into everyday life and firmly settled there.  We are already inconvenient to use the site if it does not have a map with Google Maps or the specified contact phone number is not highlighted by Skype.  For shopping, we used to go to online stores and order travel tickets there. <br><br>  You can paint all the delights of today's services for a long time, but let's think a little in another plane and try to imagine the future of the webmaster.  Who is he, the web builder of the next decade?  What services does it use and what does it focus on?  What should he know, and what, on the contrary, should not? <br><br>  It would seem just a dream, but sometimes even the wildest dreams become a reality.  How many bold ideas have been implemented just because they were able to formulate?  Examples are darkness, but I suggest simply expressing your thoughts.  Maybe someone will read your comment, think and do what you dreamed.  But for this, first of all, you need to write a comment :) <br><br>  Yes, and a little bit of daily life.  The <a href="http://webo.in/">webo.in</a> project still requires a good hosting platform (maybe it will be possible to recoup it by advertising, but I would like to deal with it last), a good design ( <a href="http://webo.in/load/%3Furl%3Dhabr.ru">the boot chart</a> can be a very functional tool with proper appearance) and, of course your comments and suggestions.  I really hope that with your help you will be able to make the service that you yourself will be <a href="http://webo.in/my/">comfortable using</a> . <br><br>  In the near future, today we need to make a tool for ‚Äúvisual optimization‚Äù of the requested resource in order to assess the amount of work and possible page load acceleration in a couple of clicks. <br><br>  Thanks to everyone who took and participates in the beta testing of new services and discussing the project, I am afraid to list all of you here, because the list will not be complete, but it will take quite a lot of space.  I really appreciate your contribution and your activity. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/21606/">https://habr.com/ru/post/21606/</a></p>
