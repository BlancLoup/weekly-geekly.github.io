Is he really that good?  Our duty is to report on the details that I came across - so the more I read about it, the less there was a desire to purchase it. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  At first glance, the device looks fantastic, with a great sound and, no doubt, the iPhone is the phone of the year.  But think, would you pay $ 500- $ 600 for any other phone?  Like many of you, I reason, buy an iPhone or not.  So I made a list of minuses (because the pros are obvious) to decide until Friday evening.

      * Price / Hard Drive: Probably the most compelling reason to wait is price.  The phone will be sold in stores for $ 500 for the 4GB model and $ 600 for the 8GB.  And you still have to sign a new two-year agreement.  Also, don't expect the iPhone to replace your iPod.  The older model will hold only 2000 songs and only a small number of videos or movies.  I also don‚Äôt understand why you should buy an iPhone and pay for a two-year contract.  You could easily get a comparable 3G-capable phone, such as the Treo 750 for $ 199 with a two-year contract, or an 80GB iPod video for almost half the price. <br><br>  * Tariff Plans: What really bothers me is that AT &amp; T also plays all this deception, forgetting about its customers.  I called AT &amp; T today to learn more details and the answer was ignorant.  Come on guys, we need price information about a month before the phone goes on sale, so we can estimate the costs.  Why is the company so secretive?  We know some details about the phone itself and the fact that it will appear on Friday.  So, why did we wait so long to see the tariff plans?  At least now we know that buying an iPhone will not be cheap.  Chris Null allocated the cost of each tariff plan, so the cheapest plan $ 60 includes 450 minutes of communication.  He says that in two years you will pay close to $ 2,000 for one service.  Plus there is an activation fee of $ 36, and on top of that, a two-year contract.  Those who are already connected to AT &amp; T will pay an extra $ 20-30 bucks for an ‚ÄúiPhone plan‚Äù that includes voice mail, 200 SMS and unlimited access to the Internet, plus the absence of a data plan without all these additional functions.  And if you think you can use the iPhone without maintenance, think again.  The official website of the phone says that to activate the features of the iPod in the phone you need a two-year agreement. <br><br>  * Network: surprisingly, the iPhone does not have 3G support, just a slower EDGE network.  Forbes believes that Apple chose a slower network because AT &amp; T‚Äôs EDGE coverage is 13,000 cities and only 165 large cities with 3G, although 3G-enabled devices also support the slower EDGE. Why did Apple even choose EDGE?  Other AT &amp; T smartphones such as Samsung, BlackJack and Treo 750 support 3G, then why AT &amp; T is so slowly moving away from old standards. <br><br>  * First generation: The main rule of geeks is to never take the first generation of devices.  Apple is one of the few companies updating its products at a very fast pace and it becomes important to wait for the next version.  Look at all the enhancements to the iPod and MacBook.  It will seem like an eternity, but I bet that this is a matter of months and we will get a new, improved version of the iPhone. <br><br>  * Long lines: I really like new technologies, but no device is worth it to stand behind him in a long queue, a few days before the release, even the iPhone.  Someone has already started to stand in a queue, and someone is arguing for real money about how many people will be trampled, beaten or hospitalized. <br><br>  And most of all of the above, doubts about the lack of a real keyboard, the inability to synchronize with the systems of corporate internal e-mail and battery life halt the doubts.  As a result, we will pay for the overvalued phone, expensive tariff plan, we will sign a new two-year contract and will still stand in line, hoping to get one.  No thanks! <br><br>  Do you still want an iPhone?  Why or why not? <br><br>  Taken from <a href="http://tech.yahoo.com/blogs/hughes/14081">Yahoo</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/11538/">https://habr.com/ru/post/11538/</a></p>
