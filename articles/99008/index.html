  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Content Consumer Portrait</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Events <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/p2p/61103/">related to interfilm.ru</a> caused another wave of discussions on whether or not to buy licensed content and what life would be like without torrents.  Very soon, the company Profi Online Research published the results of the study of content consumers - it turned out that our Internet users can buy licensed content - but they are afraid.  And besides, most support free distribution. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  In the course of the survey, the opinions of 1,200 Internet users living in large cities of Russia (survey time: June 2010. Geography: 13 Russian cities with a population of over one million, Method: Online survey. Total sample: 1,200 respondents aged 21-40 years .), it turned out that more than half of them at least once resorted to downloading / viewing music / video content, paid social networking services, games, listening to the radio, reading books and news. <br><br>  Online TV is also becoming increasingly widespread.  About 42% of respondents noted that at least once they resorted to watching TV channels via the Network.  In the past few years in our country, this has become possible due to the rapid development of technologies that enable the operator to provide customers with access to high-speed Internet. <br><br>  The data analysis also showed that there are more respondents using music and radio content in the capital than in the regions.  For example, in Moscow, 84% of study participants listen to music and download music on the Internet, while only 76% are on the periphery;  radio - 63% against 50% respectively.  Most likely, this is due to the data transfer speed, which is usually higher in the metropolitan metropolis, which allows you to play or download music content much faster and in better quality.  We also note that representatives of the youth audience in Moscow aged 21‚Äì25 years are much more active than their peers from the regions using music and video content (compared: 86% versus 69% and 78% versus 76%, respectively).  Moreover, young people from the capital use various social networks more (compare: 83% against 62%).

      Analyzing the use of Internet content depending on the gender of the research participants, the experts concluded that the male audience is very active in downloading Internet content, especially listening to the radio and watching / downloading video. <br><br>  The obtained data showed that only every tenth research participant uses paid content constantly, and their share of women was more than two times less than the share of men (6% vs. 14%, respectively).  Another half of the study participants noted that rarely resorts to using online paid content. <br><br>  The analysis showed that in the age group of 21-25 years, half of the paid online content does not apply, while among the older age group (26-30 years), such people turned out to be less - about 1/3.  This suggests that with age people become more demanding of the quality of the information received and are willing to pay for it. <br><br>  There are three main reasons for not using paid Internet content; most explain their behavior by not wanting to give money for what can be obtained, even if of lower quality, but for free (72%);  half of them are afraid of being deceived by ‚Äúvirtual‚Äù scammers, so they do not send SMS required for payment;  The third most popular reason for abandoning paid content was the fear of spending money and getting poor-quality information (44%).  It is interesting to note that women have more doubts about the quality of content than men.  In most cases, they tend to look for free resources (compare: 75% versus 68%) and are more afraid of getting what they expected after the payment was made (compare: 49% vs. 39%) <br><br>  Among the selected age groups, people of 21‚Äì25 are more afraid than others to be deceived by fraudsters when making SMS payments (56%), and also to receive poor-quality content as a result (51%).  We add that, as it turned out during the analysis of the data, half of the respondents from the regions do not use paid Internet content because they are afraid of receiving it in improper quality.  In Moscow, the share of such respondents is significantly less - about 1/3. <br><br>  In the course of the study, experts from Profi Online Research also found out from the respondents their opinion regarding the observance of the rights of owners of exclusive rights to music, video and other information on the Web.  To do this, participants in the study offered their alternative to the Torrent file sharing service known in RuNet, where they could download the necessary content for free.  It turned out that only 18% of study participants approved the existing model of raising money for licensed content based on paying for downloading information or providing access to it, but with the proviso that the price for Internet users should be acceptable and the payment methods convenient.  The overwhelming majority (79%) spoke in favor of free licensed content, suggesting that its owners compensate for the cost of content through advertising or Internet providers. <br><br>  Thus, the market of paid Internet content can develop under conditions of ensuring the security of the payment process, as well as the transparency of the system for providing guarantees of the quality of downloaded information (for example, you can return the money or make sure that the information is of good quality before the transaction is completed).  However, at this stage rights holders and Internet users have different points of view on how the sale of information on the Web should be organized. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/99008/">https://habr.com/ru/post/99008/</a></p>
