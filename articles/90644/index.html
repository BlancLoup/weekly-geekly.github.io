  <section class="page js-page"><h1>How to learn foreign languages ‚Äã‚Äãonline</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  In this topic, I will talk about how this can be done (by example). <br>  There are various sites where teachers post their announcements, some of these sites operate on the bulletin board principle, and some are part of online schools.  There are certain <b>social networks</b> on the pages of which you can get acquainted with the teacher and order his services.  For example, one of them will be my post. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Training in most cases is built via Skype + additional materials (pdf, word, etc.) and / or programs for remote access to the teacher‚Äôs desktop (this means that with the help of a special program (team viewer for example) you will see your desktop teacher that will make working together much nicer). <br><br><h6>  <b>Some practice</b> </h6><br><br>  Suppose you want to learn English.  You made registration on this site and the first thing you need to do is find a teacher who will suit you.

      I would recommend you follow these tips: <br>  - if you have a low level of proficiency in your language, then it is better to start studying with a Russian-speaking teacher; <br>  - if you know the language well - then only to the carrier.  Be careful, there are many Filipinos and Indians who offer English learning services on this site.  When choosing a teacher, the first thing to pay attention to is his story about himself, if in the story the teacher does not indicate that he is a native speaker, then it is best to ask him by sending a message message.  Personally, I do this - I watch the story and location (an indirect sign), as a rule, the speakers live in English-speaking countries. <br><br>  <b>So, we are looking for a teacher, in the Categories section, select Languages:</b> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/933/cf7/2b4/933cf72b49acc8d97056e53a2e5eb2d2.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  <b>Then choose English ‚Üí Grammar:</b> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/73f/3fe/3da/73f3fe3da96a591374c827e500b7173e.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  <b>And here is a list of teachers:</b> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/7df/508/852/7df50885207275e53c8dc8670fb09cf8.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  <b>Choose what with the photo and see his profile:</b> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/87d/033/b14/87d033b140d6b058f65b7aa66d2b4d70.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  From the description it is immediately apparent that he is a native speaker and lives in the states.  The cost of one hour of classes is $ 7 (be sure to specify how long an hour lasts - some people have 50 minutes).  You can take a free trial lesson (15 minutes) from him, during which you will learn how he teaches, listen to his pronunciation and see if your connection is sufficiently enough to train with this teacher.  The calendar on the left shows the free days and hours of the teacher.  At the same time, if you do not make a mistake during registration and specify your time correctly, the time difference between you and the teacher will be considered automatically and it is very convenient. <br><br>  <b>Also do not forget to look at the teacher's rating:</b> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/28d/b18/f56/28db18f568eb20a003f660b918fb0ebd.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  With a rating, I think everything is more or less clear - just like on ebay.  Experience, education is not always an indicator of teacher literacy. <br><br>  Suppose we want to take a trial lesson from him, for this we choose a date suitable for us on the calendar and see if the teacher is free - if so, click on the date and indicate the time convenient for us.  The lesson will be ordered.  Remember that you also have a rating and the higher and better it is, the more profitable it is for you. <br>  The main condition for successful learning is good internet speed, before starting to engage with any of the teachers I recommend doing the following: <br>  - find out what the speed of the incoming / outgoing Internet from your location to the teacher (you can do this by visiting the site speedtest.net); <br>  - Take an interest in the speed of your teacher‚Äôs Internet; <br>  - it is also necessary to find out whether your teacher uses a headset or uses a built-in microphone (in most cases, the quality of the built-in microphone leaves much to be desired, of course, you will hear your teacher, but there will probably be an echo, and do not forget that you should hear every word every excuse). <br><br>  <b>Prices</b> <br>  Not so long ago I worked with an individual with a Russian-speaking teacher and the cost of 90 minutes was 1500 ($ 50).  The prices for classes are different, each teacher asks for as much as he considers necessary.  In most cases, the cost of 60 minutes with a carrier does not exceed $ 15 (non-carriers, take less than $ 4). </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/90644/">https://habr.com/ru/post/90644/</a></p>
