  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Startup? Tie</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  There are many articles on Habr√© devoted to startups, investors, artificial and natural motivators, and so on and so on, never to IT-based semantic marketing.  Their goal is one - "to succeed."  For success and the process of its achievement - this is one of the main components of happiness.  And we all want it. <br><br>  It is worth noting that the article is 100% subjective, does not claim to be true in any instance, tries not to teach and not to instruct.  The minimum that I expect is to share my opinion, to show that it happens.  Maybe someone will share my position, someone will think, someone will pass by, the rest of Habr gives a great opportunity to minus. <br><br>  Such is life, information is available ‚Äî our right to decide whether to receive it;  if so, how;  and if received, then what to do with it.  Strictly speaking, this opportunity will be discussed.

      Friends, fellow readers, ask for a moment more attention, briefly about myself.  I am NOT a teacher, coach, trainer, mentor, philosopher, psycho \ lologist / theater / oterapist, oh yes, a master of the epistolary genre and the Russian language, unfortunately, too.  Who I really am is not important.  Because  whatever I say, each of you will come up with it decides for himself.  I can only outline the sector in which it is worth watching and I did it, listen.  In general, if you are now full of skepticism between the eyebrows, then it is better to go directly to the "minus", so as not to waste time - this is real value - you should not spend it on something that seems unworthy to you.  If at the moment you have an interest, then up to a certain point you will be with me, because  interest has already inflamed and you will be inflating it yourself.  My task is to try not to spoil everything. <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  Okay, well, enough of the intricacies of building fantasies about the world around us - this is not the topic of this article. <br><br><h5>  About word </h5><br><br>  Today it is fashionable to attend courses, seminars, trainings on how to become better / more successful / happier, to communicate with more advanced people with the goal of "he knows so much \ knows \ has seen, he has something to learn," watch, read, listen to motivators (articles, programs and recordings on tv, podcasts like ‚Äúgrab and do‚Äù, etc.).  What do you think - why? <br><br><ul><li>  At the beginning of any training, it is customary to set goals like ‚Äúbecome smarter‚Äù, ‚Äúlearn to pass the gatekeeper‚Äù, ‚Äúlive better‚Äù, ‚Äústop tolerating the beating of my wife‚Äù, and at the end of the training it is fashionable to say ‚Äúyes, I really got what I wanted, more This piece of paper is not needed. "  But in fact, by the time the achievement of the goal can actually be checked - in a month, in 3 or half a year - you don‚Äôt even remember the piece of paper, you don‚Äôt remember the name of the coach and of course your life will not change drastically.  Why are there dramatically - does not change at all. </li><li>  You are returning home: ‚ÄúHoney, I met an amazing person today, he has several companies, he is actively investing in IT, I think we will be friends‚Äù Yes, there are such people - this effect is simply explained - ‚Äúcharisma‚Äù.  And being under her influence it seems to you that you can become like that, you will learn from him, and you will become the same, NO is even better.  And if you throw the veil from the eyes?  This charisma is 45 years old, and there were only a hundred people around her who wanted the same thing.  But something the people in the city did not live better.  This is worth thinking about.  Are you better than them?  Why then do you need him, he did not have it. </li><li>  Do you listen to ‚ÄúFight and do‚Äù Sharkov, read the story of another startup?  And every time, straight heart beats faster - but here they are opportunities, money around us!  ‚ÄúThis stupid girl cannot connect 3 words, but she has money, how much you can‚Äôt earn in half a life.  And this one too.  And I would do it much faster and better, I know something! ‚ÄùYes, you wouldn‚Äôt, you know, but you don‚Äôt, or you don‚Äôt.  And no videos, books and podcasts will take you and make - they will not force.  This is utopia.  Not all people from this test are made, not all. </li></ul><br><br>  So is there a power in the word?  Certainly there.  We must go to the courses, listen to the podcasts, read success stories with only one goal - to get information HOW they did it.  The motivator is the fact that they did it.  Information - it is always useful.  Sessionss story will help to expand the boundaries of thought, an intelligent man - to show the result of what you can come to, the coach - the coach, he will help to catalog those thoughts that you have, but it is difficult to put them on the shelves.  And if what he says is a clean sheet for you, then either you are still young, inexperienced and you have everything ahead, or ... or it is regrettable. <br><br><h5>  Whose experience? </h5><br><br>  Experience can only be your own.  How many you will not read, how many you will not hear, until you try - you will not understand.  If you yourself have not reached the "truth", having heard it (even very authentically and convincingly), you, alas, cannot use it. <br><br><h5>  Is a startup a business? </h5><br><br>  I often see ‚ÄúWe are looking for investors‚Äù, ‚ÄúThere is an idea, we need money for implementation‚Äù.  Always funny.  There is an idea - there is a head, there is a head - to earn is not a problem, especially in our country.  In our country, as in any other, in order to make a business it is necessary to have an appropriate character.  And if you ochkuesh make a bet and go to the points of no return - the business is not for you.  Well, not such a person, come to terms with this, you are not ready to risk, you do not believe in yourself and your strength.  This is normal - the majority of such people, and thank God, everything rests on them.  To work for an uncle is a reliable road - it is shorter in terms of it and it is without wolves and ghosts.  Yes, she will not lead to the treasure chest and Angelina Jolie, but she will not bring them to the cemetery either - think about it. <br>  ‚ÄúThe investor is a grabber, he demands half for his money, he went crazy.  That is my idea! ‚Äù  I do not understand investors who agree to 100% financing for less than 90% share.  He takes all the risk on himself, hires you and your team to work.  All you are a mercenary.  In business go - to gain independence, let the conditional, but nonetheless independence.  By contacting an investor, you go to work for your uncle again.  Think again.  If your idea is good, but implement it yourself - ‚Äúpress‚Äù - sell it.  If she is really good, there will be a buyer.  Most likely, he will buy you in addition to the idea and to realize it.  So you will be calmer, this is your way. <br><br><h5>  What does happiness mean? </h5><br><br>  I talked a lot about fashion, and started about happiness.  What is the connection?  Now it is fashionable to be a businessman, a start-up <s>sraper</s> , to do business, etc.  But due to the fact that it is fashionable - all of this ability will not appear.  2% of the population has 50% of the world's wealth and regardless of fashion, Facebook films, memoirs of Steve Jobs - this ratio will not change.  Let's get high on what pleases us, not the masses.  We are not the masses.  As any person is an individual, his happiness is subjective.  Remember pimply school - everyone liked the same type of girls of ‚Äúmodel appearance‚Äù (despite the fact that they were not surrounded).  And now we will look at the red light district in the hero-city of Amsterdam - big, small, thick, crooked, yellow, black, half-men - yes any.  With age, a person understands what is fashionable - this is not what he needs.  And if you have a soul for a one-legged, one-eyed gypsy prostitute, then even Jolie, with a ring on her finger and handcuffs on her arm and battery, will not make you happy.  <i>(forgive me Angelina for mentioning in Sue)</i> <br><br>  Rummage in yourself, and what really inserts and fascinates you, from which you feel good and calm, from which a smile on your face crawls from chin to ears.  This is what you do.  Does not make money - but without money now tight.  Well, go to the courses, read the articles - figure out how to monetize your pleasure - this is possible.  And maybe you will become the next Jobs - but you will come to this by the only true and possible way - the way to get pleasure from yourself and your business.  Or maybe you will understand that this is not yours - and it is better to grow a bansai on weekends, and to do it at work - what they will say, because for many people the lack of responsibility is the highest happiness (otherwise why should investors?)) <br><br><h5>  Why all this? </h5><br><br>  I do not like the current trend in business development.  Business - he will develop himself.  Do not dilute its quantity, nothing will come of it.  Look at the number of startups - it is terrifying, and all the ideas have been sucked out of so much of a finger that no demotivators are needed.  That's honest, frustrating when you go to a site where, for example, they offer to grow a tree of your desires, and art is so wonderful there, and the idea is actually not bad, funny.  But it becomes sad that what the people did was talented, but they did her, which will not improve life for anyone (including the creators!), Because after a year and a half, the tree will wither.  They did it qualitatively, time was killed, and all because startups and businessmen are fashionable. <br><br><h5>  Igogo? </h5><br><br>  Thoughts are not very structured, and perhaps muddled.  But I sincerely hope that at least one of them will keep at least one of you from a thoughtless jump into the ‚Äútrend‚Äù. <br><br>  PS the post was somehow removed, at the request of the workers I restore. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/135887/">https://habr.com/ru/post/135887/</a></p>
