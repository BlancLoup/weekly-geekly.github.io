No alarm system will notice how a houseworker or an office security guard makes daily possessions, not to mention more sophisticated atrocities.  You will not install a reed switch or IR sensor on most of the problems, you must not only see them, but also analyze them.  But a person will not sit 24 hours a day at the monitors, and even more so gazing at them.

      Yes, and the owner is not at all on the object, he is somewhere in the works or on vacation.  Yes, he has a telephone, but there is no time or desire to use it permanently.  First, answer the question: <b>Being busy with work or other things, are you ready every 5 minutes to open a video application on your phone and view all the cameras in your home?</b>  And so around the clock! <br><br>  Without this action, is it possible to provide reliable video monitoring of a remote object? <br>  At least, we do not know other solutions to the issue, except <a href="http://goal.ru/mobile/video-na-telefon/">for the Gm2 technology</a> .  For an example of her work, let's take some standard object with its standard and non-standard threats.  Although, we will not waste our time on simple cases of the type: ‚Äúa suspicious person appears in the house‚Äù, but immediately threaten not too obvious plots.  Once we have declared a full video control, for clarity, we will choose a difficult option, where it is extremely difficult to distinguish unauthorized actions from among the standard behavior of strangers on the object on a legal basis. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/a7TQ8ilwCAA%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700022,15700186,15700191,15700248,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhhLzVdWdc8hPkZnXcm1M9tmgh9U5w" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  Right now, in his large brick house, our employee carries out repairs, where many strangers constantly walk: who plasters, who puts furniture, who leads the wiring ... All of them are from different companies and with an unknown reputation.  However, in most parts of the house, not only repairs have been made, but also the owners live with a fairly decent baggage of wealth.  There, even living rooms cannot be hidden from prying eyes, because you have to do constant fine-tuning of repairs, interfacing electronic devices, and put scaffolding in front of windows.  In general, steal - I do not want.  There are two ways to preserve material values: The first is to abandon work, rush about the house and constantly monitor everything, and so for 2 years.  (In this case, there will be nothing to do the repair.) Or second: use Gm2 technology. <br><br>  The owner of the house is a very busy man, but it is still necessary to control the acquired good.  Put in the main places of passage of the camera - it takes only one day, so he chose <b>Gm2</b> .  This technology, like all the others, does not have a biointellect, and, naturally, requires human participation in work.  But not according to the standard scheme: ‚Äúwe look, not blinking at the monitor‚Äù, but according to the physiological ‚Äúrarely, when we have nothing to do and want, we look‚Äù.  It takes into account the psychology of the user, his scarcity of attention, difficulty of understanding, laziness of pressing, and most importantly his natural ideology of ‚Äúperson-occupied‚Äù.  As a matter of fact, the merit of the Gm2 is that it coordinates the limitless possibilities of computers with limited human abilities. <br><br>  The technology of <a href="http://goal.ru/videonabludenie/what-is_videoanalitika/">video semantics</a> allows you to decompose all the events that occurred during the day into brief videos about them, which reduces the viewing of 24 hours to 5 minutes.  Naturally, we are not talking about any super intellectuals, the machine will not tell you that these records are criminal.  ( <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%2592%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B4%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BE%25D1%2581%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BC%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BD%25D1%2582%25D0%25B8%25D0%25BA%25D0%25B0">Video semantics are</a> different from standard (‚Äúhard‚Äù) video analytics in that they do not contain artificial intelligence and other fantastic features.) But what can be seen and understood in these 5 minutes?  To begin with, let's define ourselves: do we want to find a crime AFTER it is committed, DURING or UP? <br><br>  Find ‚Äúafter‚Äù, for example, a record of how you were killed, can any DVR, if it does not soprut.  To catch "in time" you need to plant a videographer around the clock.  But what is the point of the 19-year-long existence of Special Lab, if he had not created more advanced technologies?  Do not be afraid and threaten to prevent crime!  Of course, "during" and "after" we will also work out, leaving these options in case you are unlucky - you did not receive the information in advance. <br><br>  90% of all crime has a preliminary preparation stage.  Only a person who has smoked cigarettes will immediately burst into the first house and will demand money.  And this moment also cannot be overlooked, we will definitely return to it.  For now we will stop on the most difficult crimes - thought over. <br><br>  They are always preceded by assessment and preparatory activities.  These actions are difficult to confuse with everyday behavior, because people purposefully inspect approaches, trips, locks, look in the windows, stand where there is no comfortable smoking room or shop ... The whole list is a separate topic, adding only that there is a danger inside the object training, when someone from ‚Äúhis‚Äù prepares the ground, taping motion sensors, blocking reed switches with magnets, disabling cameras, wires and contacts. <br><br><iframe width="420" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/A0sc45T8xDQ%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700022,15700186,15700191,15700248,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhhvB8RGgnna_Z-N1nCA0zU03LpdDg" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  In this and the difficulty of identifying, actions for the preparation of a crime are usually no different from the actions of personnel, in terms of computer logic.  The movement of a passerby past the sensor from the movement of a passerby who put a adhesive plaster on the sensor is the same type of detection.  A video detector with any of the most sophisticated intellectual video analytics is just an algorithm for comparing the contrast of a picture. <br><br>  The crime itself after the preparation is not committed the next day.  It can take weeks and months, until the gentlemen, the criminals, ‚Äúgrind‚Äù everything together.  These people will come more than once, without causing any special reactions from the security electronics. <br><br>  Will the standard CCTV system notice them?  Record - for sure.  But will this archive be viewed, will the owner be warned?  Raise your hand, <b>who every day, or at least once a week, looks through all the records of your DVR?</b>  - Thank you for your honesty!  Only a complete and daily review of the archive can solve the task - to prevent the crime being prepared. <br><br>  In our case, it is still more difficult, the owner has no time even to approach the computer.  Coming past midnight, he falls off his feet, barely having time to eat.  Long trips and vacation trips do not leave a chance to check the archive.  So we lose 90 chances out of a hundred to prevent a crime? <br><br>  Let's once again analyze the livelihood of the owner, follow on the sly behind him.  Here he goes to work and gets up tightly for 30 minutes in traffic (30 - poorly said, but for example).  Then he goes to a meeting in the city department or to clarify problems in the tax.  They stand in line or wait on the chair for another 30 minutes (weak again, but we have enough).  Next for lunch, where he waits 10 minutes for an order, then another 10 minutes bills.  In the evening, you need to wash the car, another 40 minutes.  Wait for the wife in the store ... In general, such a person‚Äôs idle time per day is 2-3 hours.  And regardless of where a person is: at work, at a resort or in a train car.  But we need only 5 minutes to view the daily archive.  And the phone - he is always with you! <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/f0a/a0b/0c2/f0aa0b0c2e678f6f020b61ace138e825.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Gm2 technology in this case fully takes into account the <a href="http://goal.ru/security-systems-video/fiziologiya_udalyonnogo_opovesheniya/">human physiology</a> , it fits perfectly into those moments of his life when he does not have to do anything, but is ready to work.  Being in the daytime active state, instead of the tossed up journal of the past year, we reach for the phone and poke.  Only instead of toys - Gm2.  Of course, one has to look through the entire daily archive, but this is only 5 minutes.  And unlike the computer, we - the people - can find crime or dangerous phenomena in the records given to us.  Human intelligence is proven by science!  A few minutes - and you are aware of all the upcoming problems, if any. <br><br>  So we immediately killed a bunch of hares.  The host was freed from boredom, they reported to him about the preparation of a crime (if any), and we do not require special attention. <br><br>  To be continued‚Ä¶ <br><br>  <a href="http://geektimes.ru/company/speclab/blog/252694/">Read the FIRST PART "What is the best way to poke?"</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/365747/">https://habr.com/ru/post/365747/</a></p>
