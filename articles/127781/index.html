Taking a sober look at the result of his work, not losing a single detail on the delivery of the project, in order not to fail the demanding customer, the check list helps. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/1e0/75c/13e/1e075c13e08eaf2f5368e40c1ac449eb.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  So, the most effective checklist for checking the readiness of a site exclusively for readers of the blog Webprofessionals.ru: <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  1. Check the site for fat. <br>  Why?  Big ship - great sailing!  If it loads for a long time, it means that the project is serious and important.  And who needs it, he will wait.  At the same time it can go to the kitchen, make a sandwich so that the site can be viewed in comfort.

      2. Beautiful and animation <br>  There is no spoiling the porridge with butter.  More beautiful, java scripts and animations on the flash - let the visitor be stunned by such magnificence and click on the "order" button.  Or even rush to call you to express admiration. <br><br>  3. Fonts and text layout <br>  Font size should be made as large as possible.  Why make people grasp and spoil the sight?  The outline is recommended to choose more original, so that the site will be remembered for a long time.  Any little thoughts are better bold - <b>so they are better perceived</b> .  Well, do not forget about CapsLock - it is popular on the tower! <br><br>  4. Headers <br>  No need to make the headers the same.  Why this leveling?  Give variety!  And the visitor will be grateful - he will know exactly where he is and will not get bored. <br><br>  5. Site Domain <br>  Informative, informative and again informative.  Let the domain say that the site is super.  For example, MySuperStore.com.  Immediately after all, it is clear that the store is good! <br><br>  6. Navigation <br>  Simple navigation can be done, but not necessary.  This suppresses the visitor's research aspiration and makes him feel like an idiot (otherwise why did such an elementary thing happen?) Let him look and think.  Get a great quest! <br><br>  7. Site search <br>  It's all the same as navigation.  And then, why, so that people immediately went to the right page?  Let him walk around the site, admire the beauty. <br><br>  8. Menu <br>  The more extensive the menu, the more weight it gives the site.  It will be even better if the items are beautiful and with special effects open and close.  Flash will save the day. <br><br>  9. Code <br>  And what's the code?  Works?  That's great!  So what if everything is falling apart in some browsers?  And there is nothing to use than anything!  Meta tags are not needed - nobody sees them anyway.  Alt-s for pictures too.  And validity is a complete show-off for pedants. <br><br>  10. Links and likes <br>  Do not be greedy!  More links - more features.  Yes, let at least every word will be active - we do not mind.  And you should definitely give everyone the opportunity to show their love by pressing the ‚ÄúI like it!‚Äù Button, share the news on Twitter, Google+ and all similar sites.  And let it be in three lines on each page, even if it is the 404th. <br><br>  11. Advertising <br>  Why not make some extra money if you can?  Pop-up banners - our everything!  And so that the visitor does not cheat, do not draw a ‚Äúdagger‚Äù on advertising and only start up the site after visiting partners.  Another good solution would be to hide a couple of dozens of ads in the text, so much so that it is not immediately clear whether this is an ad or not - unexpected finds will bring many pleasant moments! <br><br>  12. Feedback form <br>  Why do people need to know who created the masterpiece?  Real geniuses are always modest.  And because the feedback form is a completely extra thing.  Especially if all eleven previous points are met. <br><br>  You can refine and supplement the checklist with items, but by ticking the twelve, you can already be sure - the site turned out to be a success.  It remains only to pass it to the customer, close the office and go to the builders.  Or wipers.  Why?  Useful profession! </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/127781/">https://habr.com/ru/post/127781/</a></p>
