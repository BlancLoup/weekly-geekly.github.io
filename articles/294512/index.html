For Yandex, this is an attempt to force SEO managers to get away from the links, and get them to work on the site, instead of putting up a big check for buying links. <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  This also applies to cheating behavioral factors.  Search engines understand perfectly when these factors are manipulated, and in the end punish them.

      <br>
      In my practice, I met a couple of good sites that twisted behavioral factors, and as a result were severely punished.  <b>Here is what happens to traffic from Yandex after applying a filter to the site:</b> <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/009/b8f/876/009b8f87650344369c91ad6b1c842480.png" alt="Graph of drop transitions from the search engine Yandex"><br>  Only after such an ‚Äúoutcome‚Äù does a person begin to think that it would be better for him to spend money on something useful.  As an SEO specialist, I recommend working on the site first of all, and for me UX-design has become as part of SEO site optimization. <br><br><h2>  What is UX design? </h2><br>  UX Design is an integrated approach to user interaction with any interface.  The main task is to ‚Äúforce‚Äù the user to achieve a certain goal by accomplishing the minimum number of actions, therefore User Experience Design aims to create the easiest and most convenient product. <br><br>  <b>UX design combines:</b> <br><ol><li>  information architecture </li><li>  interaction design </li><li>  graphic design </li><li>  content </li></ol><br>  In addition, the UX designer must have usability research skills and be able to study his target audience.  <b>Let us examine in more detail each stage:</b> <br><br><h3>  Information architecture and interaction design </h3><br>  At the stage of developing an information architecture, the target audience is primarily studied on the basis of their demographic, geographic, economic, and psychological characteristics. <br><br>  The UX-designer forms an idea about the preferences of the audience.  It depends on how the structure of the site will look like.  The task of the optimizer is to create a semantic core, and cluster requests.  Based on information about the target audience and the ND, it is necessary to develop a semantic tree of the site, a navigation structure, and a scheme of user interaction on the site. <br><br>  The page should have a minimum signal-to-noise ratio.  Useless information should not distract his attention from the useful, it is better that it was not at all.  This will allow the user to concentrate on important elements, which means that he will be able to quickly find what he needs. <br><br>  The designer must adhere to the rule: "To get to the goal - the visitor should not do more than 3 clicks." <br><br><h3>  Graphic design </h3><br>  At this stage, the designer must take into account the preferences of the target audience, and make the design as pleasant as possible for the user.  If the goal of your site is to sell exclusive doors for an order, then it is natural that a minimalist Flat design will be inappropriate here.  A person wants to see the exclusivity, the high cost of such a site.  Only this will be able to keep it on your site.  If this is an online magazine - it means nothing should distract from reading, the color scheme of the site should not tire the eyes. <br><br>  Do not forget about adaptability.  Recently, Google announced that it will underestimate the position of sites that are not optimized for mobile devices, so the UX design should be displayed everywhere everywhere, be it TV or mobile device. <br><br><h3>  Content </h3><br>  Without quality content it is impossible to achieve good results.  It is important and its filing.  Agree that reading well-structured content is much more pleasant than a concrete wall of text. <br><br>  The UX design should feed the material so that it is interesting and easy to read.  The task of an SEO specialist is to select material that can bring traffic from search engines, or in other words, develop a content strategy. <br><br>  Also, this stage should include the work of a copywriter.  Each letter is important here, the title should be catchy, and the text should be interesting. <br><br><h3>  What is the conclusion? </h3><br>  The implementation of each stage should be paired with an SEO specialist to achieve maximum efficiency in product promotion.  But do not forget that a beautiful and user-friendly site does not promise super-fast successful results in promotion, because this is a foundation that will only simplify the task of promotion. <br><br>  If you still think that buying links and cheating behaviors works better, and UX design does not become part of SEO, then look at the following chart. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/410/07b/2f6/41007b2f6d304b4980d8f3e46a847a16.png"><br>  <i>From 1 to 1000 visits per day per year</i> <br><br>  In this project, all funds were spent on improvement, analytics of user behavior and refinement of thoughtful functionality. <br><br>  <b>And what do you prefer to spend money on?</b> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/294512/">https://habr.com/ru/post/294512/</a></p>
