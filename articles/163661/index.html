  <section class="page js-page"><h1>We develop rhythm, hearing and just a great tool for rehearsals.</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  A couple of years ago I started using various services to develop my abilities - LinguaLeo, Codecademy, Coursera.  These are just great tools.  Surprisingly, but then I did not find such a service that would help my hobby - music (guitar).  The idea to create an excellent service for guitarists, which includes an educational platform, matured in December 2011.  The history of the project <a href="http://totallicks.com/">Totallicks is</a> trivial. <br> <a href="http://totallicks.com/"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/50b/6a0/0c8/50b6a00c8952e7a362dec2547d8a91f0.png"></a> <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  The first thing that came to mind was a tablature player with support for Guitar Pro formats and video synchronization.  Moreover, the goal was to sell it as a SaaS solution to several American video schools.  After about a dozen letters, I found a partner to implement my idea, we got a client and started working. <br> <a href="http://totallicks.com/tabs/92"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/c99/d9c/64f/c99d9c64f1b83f0d35c2829b21e2a25a.png"></a> <br>  Working with an American customer was convenient, but she led us away from the goal of doing service for training.  That cooperation with the United States was not very successful, but, as many like to say, ‚Äúwe got the experience.‚Äù  After 3 months, we had a working player and did not know what to do next.  There are already 2 companies on the market that do it perfectly, but block the main functionality in a free mode. <br><br>  And it started.  What do users need?  How to help people achieve better rhythm and hearing?  We started to communicate with rock schools, professionals and just amateur musicians.  The concept was born a few more months, until it regained its shape about 3 months ago. <br><br>  <a href="http://totallicks.com/">Totallicks</a> is a service that helps develop your musical abilities.  We consist of three parts: rhythm training, hearing training and tabular note player that can be synchronized with any kind of media content.  In general, our service is a set of tools that will help the musician to develop in an interesting game form.

      An example of a rhythm training - we play a rhythmic pattern, and the user must repeat it.  We show every mistake that allows you to control your result and progress.  I think this is great!  And this is only one way how you can conduct a rhythm training in Totallicks.  Now we are doing workouts on keeping the rhythm on several rhythmic patterns and not only. <br>  Totallicks hearing training is a complete development from understanding the intervals and pitch of sounds to musical dictation. <br><br><h4>  So what we have </h4><br>  2 months ago we started testing our service in the public domain.  We work in two languages ‚Äã‚Äã- English and Russian.  We launched the first basic training of rhythm and hearing and opened our tablature player completely free for users.  We have a paid subscription for premium access to rhythm and some additional features. <br><br>  People were engaged in music throughout their history and we want to make these classes even easier in the 21st century. <br>  Totallicks - service for world-class music education, free on <a href="http://totallicks.com/">totallicks.com</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/163661/">https://habr.com/ru/post/163661/</a></p>
