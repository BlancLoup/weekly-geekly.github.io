    <a name="habracut"></a><br>  Unlike web search, which searches by index of cached web pages, Google Maps contains a <em>structured directory of businesses</em> .  Each company record contains a key-value field with data that is understandable to the machine.  This should allow you to find <em>"a restaurant with a vegetarian menu and pre-order within a radius of 10km from Kiev station"</em> , but more often the catalog contains exact values ‚Äã‚Äãonly for the address and telephone number. <br><br>  Therefore, it is important not how Google searches for its own directory, but where the information is drawn from. <br><br><h4>  Location data in the Google Maps directory </h4><br>  According to Google, the directory "combines information from different sources to give the best result."  Sources are divided into two groups: <br><br>  <em>Structured</em> and <em>semi-structured</em> are data sources that can be easily brought to the key-meaning that the program can understand.  Usually this: <br><ul><li>  <strong>commercial base of enterprises</strong> that are bought </li><li>  <strong>websites containing large company directories</strong> ;  data from these sites is collected by an individual crawler, which uses regular pages to extract information from the pages of the catalog </li><li>  <strong>Google Local Business Center</strong> where business owners fill in the information themselves. </li><li>  <strong>KML (and similar) files</strong> that are used to display points using the <a href="http://code.google.com/apis/maps/">Google Maps API</a> </li><li>  <strong>custom cards</strong> </li></ul><br>  <em>Unstructured</em> - these are indexed web sites that may contain information about the company, but the data from them can not be structured. <br><br><h4>  How information is structured </h4><br>  This process can be described in three basic steps: <br><ol><li>  Key-value data comes from several structured sources. </li><li>  The enterprise data is clustered: values ‚Äã‚Äãfrom different sources are compared and accuracy and weight are determined for each. </li><li>  <strong>Structured data is complemented by unstructured *</strong> </li></ol><blockquote><h4>  * </h4>  Structured data usually contain accurate but scant information about the enterprise.  And this makes it difficult: <br><ul><li>  <strong>search</strong> ;  How to find "private kindergarten" if the directory of enterprises does not contain a field on the form of ownership? </li><li>  <strong>ranking</strong> ;  How to determine which ‚Äúpharmacy‚Äù should be the first to be issued, if all the data from one directory? </li></ul> Therefore, when the main fields for the company (name, address, telephone number) are defined, a web search is performed on request: <br> <code>_+_</code> <br>  and the pages found (and most importantly the keywords from the pages found) are associated with the company data. <br></blockquote><br><h4>  How it <em>doesn't</em> work </h4><br>  There are a number of examples where the algorithm leads to erroneous results. <br><br><h5>  <a href="http://maps.google.com.ua/maps%3Ff%3Dq%26source%3Ds_q%26hl%3Dru%26geocode%3D%26q%3D%25D1%2585%25D0%25BE%25D1%2581%25D1%2582%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BB%26sll%3D50.455537,30.491352%26sspn%3D0.059455,0.109177%26ie%3DUTF8%26hq%3D%25D1%2585%25D0%25BE%25D1%2581%25D1%2582%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BB%26hnear%3D%26ll%3D50.460291,30.49324%26spn%3D0.029725,0.054588%26z%3D14%26iwloc%3DI">We are looking for a "hostel" and find the US consular department</a> </h5><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/a49/cb3/95c/a49cb395cbb51ebeb8622c1321becba5.jpg" alt="We are looking for a hostel and find the US consular department."><br><br>  <em>The reason</em> : the hostel-association sites constantly host lists of embassies and consulates.
