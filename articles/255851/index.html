      Program participants have the opportunity to contact potential customers through participation in official SAP events, as well as open prospects for contacting a venture capital fund to finance an already established project.  In a word, all conditions are created for the development of a high-tech product and its further capitalization. <br><br>  The forum participants were able to get closer to the technical characteristics of SAP HANA and learn first-hand about the possibilities for developing applications based on the platform.  ‚ÄúWhen we talk about SAP HANA, we mean a platform for business-critical applications,‚Äù said Vasily Sukhanov, senior solution developer at SAP HANA, ‚ÄúDevelopers can migrate their applications to SAP HANA without significant changes, taking advantage of In- Memory DBMS, column storage, various programming languages ‚Äã‚Äãthat are simply integrated within SAP HANA. ‚Äù <br><br>  Applications on the SAP HANA platform work directly with data without the need for additional data transfer.  ‚ÄúYour code is not important to us,‚Äù says Gary Parnell, director of the Startup Focus program in the EMEA region, ‚ÄúHana can take the data, no matter how it is stored, process it and send it back.‚Äù <br><br><h2>  SAP HANA features: big data turbo mode </h2><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/673/c95/3d1/673c953d1f174c4fb37f649993f94059.png"><br><br>  The SAP HANA (High Performance Analytic Appliance) is a platform for developing, deploying and productively operating business-critical applications.  SAP HANA includes an in-memory relational database, a set of tools for developing application code in various programming languages, tools for processing unstructured information, a library of templates for solving machine learning problems in various business domains and many other components.  SAP, as part of its platform, offers a unique opportunity to solve problems that handle different types of workloads - OLTP and OLAP. <br><br>  The SAP HANA relational database engine supports data processing in column and inline data storage options.  In the second case, the column data storage option allows not only speeding up the aggregation operations during data processing, but also seriously compressing the data and saving a lot on the disk space for storing the original data. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/462/6ea/2f6/4626ea2f610364ec0fd330cccc7883ed.png" alt="image"><br><br>  In-Memory technology allows not only to speed up the processing of analytical requests, but also to speed up transactional requests, which are primarily characterized by low response time of the DBMS and a large number of requests per unit of time. <br><br>  The SAP HANA platform allows applications built on its basis to access data directly, which in turn offers developers the opportunity to implement the business logic of the interaction of numerous components of their application simply and efficiently, without the use of intermediate protocols and data processing layers. <br><br>  However, in the case of the transfer of previously created applications to the SAP HANA platform, it is possible to use standard open data access protocols: JDBC, ODBC, oData, REST services, ADO.  NET, Python ODBC, R language. <br><br>  The SAP HANA platform is scaled both within a single server node and within several server nodes, thus forming an SAP HANA cluster, and it becomes possible not only to automatically balance the load when processing requests from customers, but also to increase the volume of requests processed by simple Add a new node to the SAP HANA cluster. <br><br>  <b>What tasks can be solved using the power of SAP HANA?</b> <br><br>  Below we will talk about the fact that you can solve any of the tasks of interest to you on the basis of the SAP HANA platform, but for now we will give several examples of SAP projects already implemented or under active development on the basis of SAP HANA. <br><br>  <b>Personalized medicine</b> <br><br>  Decoding the genome allows you to talk about personalized medicine.  Suppose that in one gene there are approximately 200 megabytes of data available to us for analysis.  If traditional systems decipher DNA in 2-3 days, then with the help of SAP HANA this can be done in 20 minutes: 261 times faster. <br><br>  <b>Formula 1</b> <br><br>  On one racing car, McLaren, participating in the "Formula 1", installed about 150 sensors.  Indicators like speed, tire pressure, engine oil temperature are collected in real time.  For one racing lap, the system collects two gigabytes of such information, which gives about three terabytes of information for the entire race (about half a day).  SAP HANA processes similar information for each car over the past 10 years, specifically for the company McLaren. <br><br>  <b>Business forecasting</b> <br><br>  Do not forget that the main direction of ERP is primarily a business for which the use of SAP HANA opens up tremendous opportunities.  For example, you can collect a huge amount of data on the business system in real time, and build a comprehensive simulator of company productivity.  At the same time, business leaders are not faced with the problem of data sampling: the sample can be made really large, and the system will not lose in speed. <br><br>  These are just a few examples of how SAP HANA can be used as a data processing system.  It also finds wide application in marketing, management, logistics, and other industries, the quality of which can be significantly improved with timely analytics. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/6a5/b4b/7a4/6a5b4b7a423544649448db1ffb61e08e.jpg"><br>  <i>Vasily Sukhanov, senior solutions developer on the SAP HANA platform, talks about the technical advantages for developing business-critical applications.</i> <br><br>  In the course of the SAP Forum held on April 9, the platform developers told about its advantages, in particular, that applications built on its basis can be scaled without much effort. <br><br><h2>  SAP HANA Startup Focus </h2><br>  SAP Startup Forums are held regularly and traditionally are a meeting place for SAP specialists and developers who learn about the capabilities of the system and plan to use it for themselves.  This time, the SAP Startup Forum was held as part of the general SAP Forum, as a separate section highlighting the possibilities for cooperation among SAP developers. <br><br>  Vyacheslav Gershov, Director of Business Development for SAP Labs in the CIS, Vasily Sukhanov, Senior Solution Developer at SAP HANA and Gary Parnell, Director of Startup Focus in the EMEA region, as well as a representative of Startup Focus and Startup Focus Oleg Demidov. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/844/3f1/37b/8443f137b14ce1a02b4bc6140371685c.jpg" alt="image"><br>  <i>Gary Parnal sure: with SAP HANA, start-ups are always on the crest of a wave</i> <br><br>  This program lasts 12 months and is a business accelerator, a kind of ‚Äúeasy way to start.‚Äù  Program participants receive free access to SAP HANA technology, training materials, expert advice on SAP technologies and business development, as well as support in promoting their solutions to the market. <br><br>  ‚ÄúAt the same time, SAP is not included in the share of participating companies and does not require any financial obligations.  On the contrary, we help program participants to attract funding, if such is necessary.  To do this, we have contacts in SAP venture funds, such as SAP Ventures, we also maintain working relationships with independent venture funds and development institutions, for example, Skolkovo, RVK, Almaz Capital, Maxfield Capital and others, ‚Äùsays Vyacheslav Gershov. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/ZutQBKoSWaI%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700023,15700186,15700190,15700248,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhjpvpaZZrath664B6lfx-tkXS9urQ" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br>  <i>Vyacheslav Gershov about opportunities in Startup Forum</i> <br><br>  The program consists of several stages.  The preparatory stage includes the initial training of technology, after which developers can offer their solution based on the platform. <br><br>  At the next stage, the description of the idea is considered by the expert council, which decides on the inclusion of developers in the program. <br><br>  If the project is admitted to the program, then its participants are expected to continue training and work on a prototype: access to SAP HANA technology and data.  A product solution is being developed, which is further promoted at thematic conferences and exhibitions. <br><br>  A striking example of such success at the last SAP Forum was the startup <a href="http://navigine.com/">Navigine</a> , which is developing an SDK for orientation in confined spaces.  An application developed for the SAP Forum using this SDK served as participants for comfortable navigation and evaluation of the proposed materials. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/62d/201/799/62d2017999ab462786e8153fefb4ae40.jpg"><br><br>  As Oleg Demidov told us, ‚ÄúNavigine is a platform for developing high-precision indoor geolocation services.  Our technology is based on Wi-Fi and Bluetooth LE fingerprinting, measurements from the internal sensors of the smartphone, odometer information and allows us to achieve an accuracy of 1 meter.  Our long-term goal is to become a strategic partner of SAP in the implementation of corporate solutions based on precise navigation and indoor tracking. ‚Äù <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/263/fb5/36b/263fb536b81d4ef087e094e1e9c6a016.jpg"><br>  <i>The heat map of the movements of the Forum participants provided by Navigine</i> <br><br>  The joint platform Navigine-SAP allows you to implement the following functions: <br><br><ul><li>  collection, storage and analysis of data on the movement and actions of visitors to the forum in real time; </li><li>  navigation of users of the mobile application on the forum; </li><li>  visualization of the collected data and the results of their analysis in the form of "heat maps" of stand attendance and reports in real time </li></ul><br><br>  - and much more, which, in turn, allows us to say that ‚Äúthis concept directly fits into the framework of the finished product for corporate customers, such as retail chains, shopping and entertainment centers, airports, etc.  - which is important interactive interaction with customers through a mobile application. " <br><br>  We can only wish the guys good luck, because despite the young age of this project, it sounds very confident, and the SAP Startup Focus program in turn provides startups with the tools for market promotion - from venture financing to successfully implemented projects and ending with their own customer base. <br><br><h2>  Creative environment for developers inside SAP </h2><br>  The SAP forum turned out to be a very friendly place for developers.  In addition to the huge amount of information about developing on the basis of the SAP HANA platform and the possibilities of organizing your own projects, the organizers did not forget that creative activity manifests itself in a creative environment, so you could create your own sketch with a 3D pen, manage a quadrocopter, try glasses on the forum stands. virtual reality, drive on the Tesla-mobile and set an assessment of everything that happens in the application, simultaneously winning prizes from the organizers of the forum. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/354/5a0/ced/3545a0cedd8f4180b73ce4cd33e876c4.jpg"><br><br>  In short, the organizers tried to convey the philosophy of the SAP team, in which creativity and innovation are organically combined with serious decisions in the field of data collection and processing.  This is a reminder that the new SAP Labs office is designed as a single working environment not only for teams working within the laboratory, but also as a collaborative workspace to strengthen relationships and collaboration, which, for example, can come for a one-time brainstorming or organize a space for collaboration with SAP Labs specialists for a long time. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/00b/1f8/00a/00b1f800aef849ae98a399c47eeb4dfa.jpg"><br><br>  All forum participants, despite the serious positions they held, turned out to be very open and friendly, answered all questions with pleasure and offered their help.  All this allows you to believe that in case you have a corresponding idea based on the SAP HANA platform - now you know what to start is really simple: you will be trained, prompted, guided and will provide full cooperation on your project - a kind, it‚Äôs a dream for developers and startups who are ready to discover new horizons in the technological business environment. <br><br>  Useful links: <br>  ¬ª <a href="http://go.sap.com/developer.html">Technology for developers</a> <br>  ¬ª <a href="http://startupfocus.saphana.com/">About SAP Startup Focus</a> <br>  ¬ª <a href="http://startupfocus.saphana.com/%3Funonce%3D02bd4e8a82%26uformid%3D1021%26s%3Duwpsfsearchtrg%26skeyword%3Dhundreds%2Bof%2BHANAusecases">Startup Success Stories</a> <br><br>  Thanks for attention.
