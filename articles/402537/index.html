Is it time to update?</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Yesterday, Apple released its most affordable iPad (from $ 329 in the US) and a red iPhone 7. The new line of tablets replaced the Air 2, squeezing out by passing the younger iPad Mini models.  <a href="http://qwintry.com/%3Futm_source%3DGeekTimes%26utm_medium%3DBlog_2017%26utm_campaign%3D1Q">Banderolka</a> examines the characteristics of the new iPad and shares other news from Apple ‚ûú <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/211/10c/dae/21110cdaea034277b4f0ba6ee6c196e9.jpg"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  <a href="http://www.apple.com/ipad-9.7/">iPad 2017</a> model can not be called a cardinal upgrade.  Something he looks like the old, something different from him.  On the one hand, the screen is the same 9.7 inches, slightly brighter, but still IPS, Retina 2048 √ó 1536.  No 3D touch, thin frames or curved edges of the display, which were rumored.  Modules LTE, GPS &amp; GLONASS, Bluetooth - all the same.

      On the other hand, they updated the heart of the tablet - the processor.  Now it is A9, migrated here from the iPhone 6S and 6S Plus.  In addition, the case became thicker - 7.5 mm instead of 6.1mm for the <a href="https://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/buy/ipad-air-2/ci/27325/N/3713084288">Air 2</a> , and the tablet itself gained weight, though only 32 grams.  They removed the 16Gb model from the line, leaving 32 Gb and 128 Gb, equipped the device with an 8-megapixel main and 1.2-megapixel front-facing cameras, as well as a 32.4Wh battery, allowing the iPad to work from one charge to 10 hours. <br><br><h3>  <font color="#ff8300">Substitute</font> </h3><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/d5c/d38/db7/d5cd38db72fc4981ac41f84bc9056548.jpg"><br><br>  The new tablet, in fact, has become a compromise model.  It is not available in Rose Gold, there is no Apple Pencil support, as well as new technologies that can surprise a sophisticated user.  Apple's idea is different.  In addition to the presentation of the new tablet and a number of changes, the technology giant from Cupertino removed <a href="https://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/buy/ipad-mini-2/ci/27328/N/3713084285">all iPad Mini models</a> from sale, leaving only 128-gigabytes worth $ 399.  Thus, the new iPad has become the most affordable tablet from Apple.  <b>The price is a key update, and this is what Vice President of Marketing Phil Schiller spoke about at the iPad presentation.</b>  He also mentioned that there are more than 1.3 million apps created specifically for the iPad in the AppStore.  Of course, the iPhone doesn‚Äôt compare, but Android tablets with adapted applications are really bad. <br><br>  Apple's calculation that consumers will update tablets as often as smartphones has failed.  The latter, by the way, played almost the main role in this, growing from year to year with screens.  Therefore, in the advertising teasers iPad is often shown in conjunction with the iPhone.  Such a tablet is needed by Apple in order, on the one hand, to attract those who do not have a tablet at all, on the other hand, to force the users of old models like the iPad 2 to update. As the results of last year showed, powerful and expensive Pros do not solve this problem.  But a simple, clear and, most importantly, cheap iPad has to revive the direction. <br><br>  IPad sales start March 24th.  As always, the prices for a novelty in America are <a href="http://www.apple.com/us/shop/goto/buy_ipad/ipad_9_7">noticeably lower</a> than in Russia.  Over the ocean, a model with 32Gb and without a 4G module will cost a record low of $ 329, and for the most "tricked" model with 128Gb and LTE will be asked $ 559.  In Russia, prices start at 24,990 pbles ($ 436), the older model will cost 41,990 rubles ($ 732).  Date of commencement of sales in Russia is still unknown: Apple vaguely says about the start in April. <br><br>  To save more than 20% on the new iPad will help <a href="http://qwintry.com/%3Futm_source%3DGeekTimes%26utm_medium%3DBlog_2017%26utm_campaign%3D1Q">Bandera</a> .  Until March 31, the company buys for free and places orders from the seven largest American online stores, including from the official seller of Apple equipment - the New York store B &amp; H.  Delivery from the USA to Russia will cost <a href="https://qwintry.com/ru/calculator/%3Futm_source%3DGeekTimes%26utm_medium%3DBlog_2017%26utm_campaign%3D1Q">no more than $ 26</a> . <br><br><h3>  <font color="#ff8300">iPhone (RED)</font> </h3><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/1c5/d7d/0bd/1c5d7d0bdb464ac09eb4f4482abb1f9b.jpeg"><br>  In addition to the new iPad, Apple introduced the <a href="http://www.apple.com/shop/buy-iphone/special-edition-iphone-7">iPhone 7 and 7 Plus in red</a> .  The devices have become part of the joint Apple and (RED) product line, and the proceeds from their sales go to help people suffering from HIV.  At the moment, the company has collected about 130 million dollars, selling <a href="http://www.apple.com/shop/accessories/all-accessories/made-by-apple">red covers, straps for Apple Watch and other products</a> created in conjunction with (RED). <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/1NecJBNozBQ" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  A limited series of smartphones in a red aluminum case will go on sale on March 24, Banderole customers can try to buy them on their own at <a href="http://www.apple.com/shop/buy-iphone/special-edition-iphone-7">apple.com</a> and save more than $ 300. <br><br>  <b>Prices for new models in the US start at $ 749, on the iPhone 7 Plus - from $ 869.</b>  <b>In Russia, the cost of the iPhone 7 with a 4.7-inch display will be 60,990 rubles.</b>  <b>($ 1070) for a model with 128 GB of RAM, prices for the iPhone 7 Plus with a display of 5.5 inches start at 70,990 rubles.</b>  <b>($ 1245).</b>  <b>You can save and order new iPhones in traditional colors from <a href="https://qwintry.com/landing/apple/%3Futm_source%3DGeekTimes%26utm_medium%3DBlog_2017%26utm_campaign%3D1Q">Banderolki</a> .</b>  <b>We buy them from Apple authorized resellers in Germany.</b> <br><br>  In the end let's go over the less significant news from Apple.  Yesterday, the company removed the 16Gb model from the <a href="https://qwintry.com/landing/apple/%3Futm_source%3DGeekTimes%26utm_medium%3DBlog_2017%26utm_campaign%3D1Q">iPhone SE</a> line, showed off several new straps for the Apple Watch and the Clips application, a social messenger network for sharing short videos, something like Snapchat, but without masks.  The application requires iOS 10.3, so it is likely that the new release will appear in the near future: perhaps with the release of the <a href="http://www.apple.com/shop/buy-ipad/ipad-9-7">new iPad</a> . <br><br> <a href="https://qwintry.com/landing/2017-sevens/ru/%3Futm_source%3DGeekTimes%26utm_medium%3DBlog_2017%26utm_campaign%3D1Q"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/125/f83/d82/125f83d82f1f4acc8658128c7dea0c28.png"></a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/402537/">https://habr.com/ru/post/402537/</a></p>
