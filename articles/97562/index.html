  <section class="page js-page"><h1>School project. Linux at school number 64 - Rostov-on-Don</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  On Saturday, June 26th, we, in a group of two people, I and lamp (Sergey) visited school 64. Unfortunately, the installation time was very limited this time, since two hours later we had an RNDLUG meeting.  Teacher Tatyana Anatolyevna met us in a small, but comfortable and bright class of computer science. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  We talked about the reasons and principles of the transition of schools to the PSPD.  She told us that she had already installed school Linux, but she didn‚Äôt particularly like it.  This is not surprising, because it is rather difficult to evaluate such a complex subject as a software distribution kit, having practically no information about it.  We provided the teacher with normative documents on the topic (from FAO), review of teaching materials (educational and methodical complexes).  Then I took up the installation, and Sergey told and showed Tatiana Anatolievna what practically can be done in Linux, both in terms of teaching computer science and other activities. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/adb/9bf/44e/adb9bf44e2ecef016c779ae39c4a5570.jpg" alt="image"><br>  And at this time I made a installfest.  So, what we had.  Computers were purchased three years ago (E2140 @ 1.6GHz, 500Mb, 80Gb, DVD) in the amount of 10 + 1 (teachers).  On board was installed software from the first-aid kit.  Something like this - WinXP Prof SP2, MSOffice 2007, KAV6.0, Adobe Reader Photoshop, EffectionStudio, C &amp; M (World of Computer Science 3.4), MSVisualStudio6.0.  The network was on 5 computers. <br>  I put AltLinux4.0 second system.  The installation was absolutely no problem.  It remained only to establish the primacy of Windows boot in the bootloader.  The truth is, on two more computers, the installation has not even begun, due to reading errors from the DVD. <br>  Unfortunately, due to lack of time, we did not have time to install all the computers (we made 7).  Including, did not configure the network and SmartBoard.  But we agreed on a repeat visit to complete the installation completely. <br>  As in all past cases, we explained that our activity on the installation of CEPs in schools is only an aid to informatics teachers (they are usually responsible for ICT) in taking the first step.  Naturally, only the work of all those involved in the process (teachers, methodologists, training structures, PP) will give a real result. <br><br>  <b>UPD</b> : today - June 29th, until everything was installed that was not finished.  In particular, an interactive whiteboard (which so confused individual readers) was launched without any problems at all.  Just downloaded and installed the software from the manufacturer's website, if anyone is interested - smartboardsoftware9.7.68.0. </div>
