My old friend Fujitsu-Siemens had difficulty pulling out the applications I needed and, besides, the evaluation version of Windows 7 had expired, and I wanted to buy a laptop with an OEM version of Windows 7. <br><br>  Since the Intel Core i3 / i5 / i7 processor family has already appeared, I decided to buy a laptop on this platform.  At first, my choice was for the <a href="">Samsung R580</a> , but, after an in-person meeting, I was dissatisfied with its excessive glossiness.  There were also rumors that he was heating up a lot (I don‚Äôt know if they are true). <br><br>  Then I became interested in <a href="http://spb.notik.ru/goods/8293.htm">ASUS K52-Jr</a> .  This laptop was no longer glossy, with a less powerful video card and much cheaper than Samsung.  But all the forums were full of messages about the choke on the motherboard.  There was absolutely no desire to put up with this, and this option was also swept away.

      I was thinking about Sony Vaio, about Toshiba, when suddenly <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/lenovo/blog/90928/">a</a> review of the Think Pad Edge 14 <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/lenovo/blog/90928/">appeared</a> on Habr√©. After the first picture I became interested in this laptop ... and now I have become its owner.  So, go to the story. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/92e/6df/ccf/92e6dfccf6571eed0859e0e0ffba9d21.jpg"><br><br><h3>  Specifications </h3><br><br>  Intel Core i5 430M <br>  4GB DDR3 <br>  500GB HDD <br>  ATI Radeon HD 5145 512MB <br><br><h3>  Housing </h3><br><br>  This is not a classic ThinkPad with a non-thinable magnesium alloy casing.  The case is made of plastic, but its advantageous difference from other budget notebooks is that this plastic is matte.  There is not a single glossy part in the case, and it is beautiful!  The shape of the case is also different from the classic ThinkPads, but for me this form turned out to be much more attractive (and I'm not alone, many of my acquaintances highly appreciated the appearance of this laptop). <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/800/4a5/268/8004a52689847bcfb131b96e4c043612.jpg"><br><br>  It weighs 2.26 kg good. <br><br><h3>  Ports / peripherals </h3><br><br>  4 USB 2.0 (one of them is combined with eSata, and one is designed for charging mobile devices) <br>  VGA <br>  HDMI <br>  Ethernet <br>  DVD RW <br><br><h3>  Display </h3><br><br>  He is matt! <br><br>  I am not an expert on the evaluation of matrices, the matrix suits me.  In 14 and 15 inch models the resolution is the same - 1366x768.  For some, it will certainly turn out to be insufficient, but for me - just right. <br><br><h3>  Keyboard </h3><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/b2b/15c/b80/b2b15cb80bd069bb2b6dfae881c51da1.jpg"><br><br>  Reading overseas reviews of the ThinkPad Edge, I noticed that everyone considered it their duty to pay attention to the keyboard.  This is not a classic ThinkPad keyboard, which has many fans.  Lenovo, obviously, decided to go on about the fashion and made a chicklet-keyboard (a la Apple or Sony Vaio), in which the keys are separated from each other at significant intervals.  However, unlike most similar solutions, in which the buttons are completely flat, here they are concave and, it seems to me, this adds convenience when typing (as foreign observers also say).  Even to an unprepared user (for example, my girlfriend) this keyboard seems very comfortable and attractive. <br><br>  There are controversial points in it: the Fn key on the Ctrl key (changing in the BIOS settings) and the PgUp and PgDn cursor keys located in the block (due to the fact that they are drowned a little more than the other keys, accidental clicks are excluded, and the layout itself seems logical ). <br><br><h3>  Touchpad / Trackpad </h3><br><br>  This is a ThinkPad, so in the center of the keyboard we see the famous, sorry for the expression, ‚Äúclitoris‚Äù, it‚Äôs also ‚Äúpimp‚Äù, ‚Äújoystick‚Äù, etc.  Officially, it is called a trackpoint and forms part of the UltraNav system, which also includes a touchpad.  The touchpad, by the way, in this model has a considerable size and supports many multitouch gestures.  In fact, possessing trackpoint and touchpad, the mouse is not needed in everyday operations. <br><br><h3>  Iron </h3><br><br>  This is an Intel Core i5, baby.  The most modern Intel platform, providing amazing performance (albeit, after AMD Turion 64, it is amazing !!!) and low power consumption.  Also, my model has a discrete ATI Radeon HD 5145 graphics card, which allows, for example, to play Dragon Age, but, unfortunately, does not have the ability to switch to an Intel-integrated adapter (which would increase battery life). <br><br>  In general, a bunch of Core i5 / ATI Radeon HD 5145/4 GB DDR3 easily grinds any applications I need. <br><br><h3>  Heat / Noise </h3><br><br>  Many reviews claim that the Core i5 is almost not heated.  This is not the case - when performing demanding applications, the temperature of the air blown out from the cooler is quite high.  For example, if you leave a cold cola in front of the left side of the laptop (where the air outlets are located), the cola will cease to be cold extremely quickly.  Keep in mind.  ))) However, the air exhaust is well-organized and the hot air does not create discomfort when working.  The surface of the beech under the hands also does not heat up to any unpleasant temperature. <br><br>  Fan noise is almost always present, but its volume is extremely small, and the noise itself is uniform, so that very soon it ceases to attract attention.  There is no famous choke in my beech (pah-pah-pah!) And, in general, I would call the noise level low. <br><br><h3>  Autonomous work </h3><br><br>  I personally did not measure extreme values, I myself worked for two hours without reducing the power / brightness and turning off wi-fi.  Reviews say that you can work in this mode for up to 3.5 hours.  And official information says that all 4. In any case, the battery in the kit is 6-cell, and the platform of the laptop is not the most energy-intensive.  Although, the older brother of the T410 works longer, I suspect that due to the integrated video card. <br><br><h3>  Soft </h3><br><br>  The laptop is preinstalled with Windows 7, as well as the ThinkVantage toolkit.  For the sophisticated IBM, this will say a lot, and for the uninitiated, these are very handy programs for managing power consumption, Internet access, updating drivers, etc. <br><br><h3>  Price </h3><br><br>  Personally, I bought my laptop for 31,990 rubles.  Less powerful beech with Core i3 and 2GB RAM (but, at the same time, with discrete graphics) can be bought for 25-26 thousand. <br><br><h3>  Verdict </h3><br><br>  Behind: <br><br><ul><li>  matte case </li><li>  matt display </li><li>  powerful processor </li><li>  discrete video </li><li>  comfortable keyboard </li><li>  attractive appearance </li></ul><br><br>  Vs: <br><br><ul><li>  resolution </li><li>  keyboard (Fn and Ctrl, Insert / Delete / Home / End) </li><li>  inability to work with an integrated video card </li></ul><br><br><h3>  Personal impressions </h3><br><br>  I am dragged from his appearance!  ))) He is strict and at the same time stylish.  Performance in working applications (Visual Studio 2008, SQL Server Management Studio 2008) completely satisfies me.  And, moreover, more or less modern games also feel very cheerful (I haven‚Äôt played anything for five years, and here I decided to try Dragon Age - I was shocked!).  Also, the 14-inch version is much more compact than my old 15-inch beech, and this is good news. <br><br>  I am very pleased with this purchase, comparing this book in the store and those that I wanted to buy before him, all doubts about the choice were dispelled. <br><br>  PS I haven‚Äôt written long texts for a long time, sorry for stylistic and other mistakes. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/94515/">https://habr.com/ru/post/94515/</a></p>
