After this round, the total amount of funding received over the years of the five-year company will be $ 12 billion. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  According <a href="http://uk.businessinsider.com/uber-is-about-to-raise-a-giant-round-at-a-65-billion-valuation-heres-how-thats-even-possible-2015-11">to</a> Business Insider, Uber representatives say that the company in the foreseeable future does not intend to become public by selling the company's shares on the stock exchange, despite more than $ 10 billion in annual profits. <br><br>  The last private company, which has grown to such an extent that its value was estimated at more than 60 billion dollars, was Facebook in 2011.  In March 2011, Mark Zuckerberg‚Äôs project was valued at $ 65 billion, when less than 0.1% of the company's shares were acquired by General Atlantic.  And after 14 months the company was forced to become public.  Basically, this happened because Facebook owned so many people that the company would have to report on the business as a public company.  In 2012, Facebook was valued at $ 100 billion, becoming the third most expensive company, second only to Visa and Enzel.

      Despite the fact that now Uber is almost the same size and is developing at the same pace as Facebook four years ago, it is in a much better situation than the last one in 2012.  The company learned from Facebook's mistakes and therefore conducts tight control over those who own shares of the company. <br><br>  According to Uber CEO Travis Kalanick (Travis Kalanick), market dynamics have changed in recent years, and private companies today have a lot of capital.  Therefore, before the companies there is no such urgent need to become public, as it was before.  The legislation has also changed: new regulations allow companies to stay private longer than they plan to use Uber. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/297292/">https://habr.com/ru/post/297292/</a></p>
