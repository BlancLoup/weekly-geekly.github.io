      <i>Good afternoon, Ilya!</i> <i><br></i>  <i>We are pleased to announce that in the course of the proceedings with the insurance company, we were able to obtain compensation for the investment in the parcel P100613 EC640565276US.</i>  <i>Unfortunately, the cost of delivery of the US mail is not returned, the refund from the insurance company will be [numbers] $.</i>  <i>Currently, the claim is satisfied, the transaction is being processed, we are awaiting confirmation of the actual receipt of funds from the bank in the United States, upon receipt of which the funds will be credited to your account.</i> <i><br></i>  <i>Considering that you widely discussed the situation with your sending on various blogs and resources, for example, on <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/">habrahabr.ru</a> , we kindly ask you to bring the outcome of the proceedings in your topics and to abandon the unreasonable accusations against the company that you have repeatedly made.</i> <i><br></i>  <i>Sincerely.</i> <br><br>  The first emotions, of course, were joyful.  Although I lost almost 15 thousand rubles.  on the shipment of goods and services eBayToday, but at least something (as I thought) was able to return. <br><br>  However, trying to withdraw this compensation to WebMoney, I was faced with the fact that the system forbade me to withdraw money in any way except to credit it to the phone. <br><br>  To clarify the situation for the reader, I will tell you how I entered money into eBayToday a year ago.  Then, on the eve of the new year, having collected the amount I needed for the purchase, I ran off on ebay.com, where I monitored how the bidding for the very Macbook Pro (which was stolen somewhere in the mail) is progressing - until the end of the bidding a few hours, and eBayToday (to my great surprise) did not work directly with Visa.  Time was running out and I decided to replenish the balance in the eBayToday system via the phone.  Transferring the entire amount to my phone, I sent SMS for payment.  Then another surprise was waiting for me - from one number I could enter only 15 thousand rubles, so I had to ask good acquaintances to use their phones to enter the full amount in portions.  The money was successfully credited, and I paid for their eBayToday services, the cost of the laptop, its delivery, insurance ... <br><br>  However, let's go back in today.  After an unsuccessful attempt to withdraw my compensation via WebMoney, I wrote to the eBayToday support and received the following answer: <br><br>  <i>You have independently chosen replenishment through mobile operators, this method has its own characteristics, which are regulated, first of all, by the operator.</i> <i><br></i>  <i>We will send the management a request for the possibility of withdrawing funds for you on an exceptional basis to another system, it will be considered.</i> <i><br></i>  <i>However, the features of the withdrawal of funds are in no way connected with your claims, which you have not once, not only on habrahabr.ru, but on our club, VKontakte, etc.</i>  <i>You made unfounded accusations against the company, shifting us the responsibility for poor-quality provision of services by mail, theft of goods, as well as the fact that we refused to conduct a trial for you and a number of other complaints.</i>  <i>Once again, we kindly ask you within 48 hours to indicate in these topics about the groundlessness of your claims, the conduct of the proceedings and the result of its completion.</i>  <i>Our marketers will get acquainted with the updates in these posts.</i> <i><br></i>  <i>Respectfully,</i> <i><br></i>  <i>eBayToday.ru team</i> <br><br>  Thus, for today, eBayToday compensation for me is just the NUMBERS IN THEIR SYSTEM.  I can not dispose of these figures.  Even if you bring them back to the phone (which is unacceptable even if only because there are big problems with cashing these funds), I still get only a part of this money, because partly they will return to the phones of my friends who helped me for a year ago, many of them have already changed SIM cards anyway, and some of them already live in another city (and, accordingly, they also changed SIM cards). <br>  Separately, I also emphasize that when I injected funds, there was no warning that they could be withdrawn only in the same way.  In addition, I think that any Habrayuzer understands that there are no technical limitations here - the money I put in was spent on the macbook, the delivery and the work of eBayToday employees.  Money that is credited to my eBayToday account is received from an insurance company.  As for the money received for indemnification of the insured event, this stupid restriction created artificially can be applied to impede the withdrawal of funds from eBayToday and reduce their outflow of clients. <br>  I wrote about my indignations in eBayToday support, but they agree to deal with the problem only after I give up my ‚Äúunfounded‚Äù claims to them. <br><br>  <i>Your topics on the specified resources spoil the reputation of the company, and without reason.</i>  <i>For our part, we conducted a trial with the insurance company, we spent production resources, staff time, paid telephone calls, etc., i.e.</i>  <i>we have kept our promises.</i>  <i>What guarantees do we have that you keep yours?</i>  <i>We suggest that you now notify the forums about the positive conclusion of the proceedings, and for withdrawal of funds, you can write after it is made.</i>  <i>We do not in any way ask you to distort the data, on the contrary, only provide true and current information.</i> <i><br></i>  <i>Respectfully,</i> <i><br></i>  <i>eBayToday.ru team</i> <br><br>  Well - I bring up to date information, and at the same time summarize some intermediate results: <br><ul><li>  I spent a lot of money </li><li>  I have been waiting for almost a year, but I never saw my laptop. </li><li>  I lost a lot of time, nerves and money, calling EMS, chatting with eBayToday, visiting lawyers </li><li>  Almost a year later, I was given back only a part of my money, but I cannot even use it - for now these are just numbers. </li><li>  I became a hostage of eBayToday, who demand from me to restore their ‚Äúhonor of uniform‚Äù, if I only want to get my money back (and then, notice, not all) </li></ul><br><br>  <b>UPD:</b> today, 3 days after writing the topic, the money was finally transferred to WebMoney.  And thanks for that. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/133020/">https://habr.com/ru/post/133020/</a></p>
