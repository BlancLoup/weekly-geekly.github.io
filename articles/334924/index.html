These are not just logos - we always design a logo in a presentation that shows how to properly use logos, colors and style elements.  It's easier to see once: <a href="https://www.behance.net/Logomachine">Portfolio</a> .  In two months, our customers' logos were viewed about 50,000 times. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/289/63f/d3f/28963fd3f0e84b02a01bc41ce0f92f25.jpg" alt="image">

      In June, we decided to create an image project - a corporate identity concept for Bitcoin cryptocurrency, at the moment only about 16,000 people have looked at work at Behance - this is without taking into account other resources.  Behance issued a ribbon - graphic design to our project and placed it in his gallery.  In addition to Bitcoin, the tape and Behance recognition in July received another project - corporate identity for web developers from <a href="https://www.behance.net/gallery/54192207/Webcat">Barcelona</a> . <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/2f9/e39/e62/2f9e39e62f134ce6a79053251be2f60e.gif" alt="image"><br>  <i>The full Bitcoin presentation is <a href="https://www.behance.net/gallery/54434989/Bitcoin-Concept">here.</a></i> <br><br><h3>  Production: Harnish's planning </h3><br>  In July, the Scrumban system was introduced, which, however, was later replaced by Waterfall (as the art director told us).  So we have a visual tracking system for redlines (internal development deadlines) - it helps to keep within the warranty period of 14 days, excluding weekends.  Before we started using this system, it was more difficult to keep track of dates.  This led to the fact that we gave the client a logo that we developed. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/5db/101/199/5db10119948e48f18bafa5101164d263.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  We began to conduct daily morning planning meetings, in which all office staff participate.  At such a meeting, each of the employees voices their tasks for the day, and we also bring up the KPI for discussion.  Planerki organized by technology Verna Harnish. <br><br>  Such meetings help to synchronize with each other, to understand who and what is doing, how much time it takes for him.  In addition to daily planning meetings, there are weekly, monthly and quarterly - they help not to miss the direction of the company and give an understanding of how fast we are moving towards the goal. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/600/975/ede/600975ededfb48d6a72bbbb8f02352da.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Once a week we hold <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3D_yV3oJ9PG2s">webinars</a> for the team on the process of work, the generation of ideas, the creation of animation, etc.  During the webinar, we note the downsides and growth points for the whole team, and then prepare short lectures on these items. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/e2e/ae4/52a/e2eae452aaea4c65be024f8dc5d2015a.png" alt="image"><br><br><h3>  SMM department: hashtags and streams </h3><br>  At the beginning of the year, in our Vkontakte community, the #logomachine_help heading appeared.  For this hashtag, we are looking for posts in social networks where people ask us for tips on logos and other design elements.  We quickly show what can be improved graphically in design and make a post to the group about it. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/de9/931/5bc/de99315bc6fc42cb83b06a35dfed6b39.png" alt="image"><br><br>  Our heading is not a complete redesign, but only tips that can be improved. <br>  Once every 2 weeks we post a <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/company/logomachine/blog/325994/">report</a> in which we give general tips for improving the design on the example of our participants.  Over the entire existence of the rubric, we have helped 40 participants - they all received graphic tips, and the source files of the corrected logos, for free.  At the moment, the rubric has given us a large coverage of ~ 394.000. <br><br>  In June, we began to conduct live video broadcasts in our community, every Thursday we meet with subscribers and new visitors on the stream. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/118/938/3ef/1189383ef0e1442db9849e3d866cc32a.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  On the broadcast we briefly tell what happened in a week, what interesting was released, what vacancies are, then we hold mini-lectures.  For example, in recent broadcasts, Roman Gorbachev (the founder of Log Machine Machine) talked about whether logos is necessary for the world at all?  And he showed a presentation with examples and interactivity.  Next, we will conduct #logomachine_help online, where users send their designs, and we, led by the art director, discuss the flaws and give advice.  So far, we do not know what these meetings give us, but we like this format, and we will develop and continue it.  Broadcast with the analysis of the design, we spend every Thursday at 18:00, <a href="https://vk.com/logomachine">in the community.</a> <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/VrIIHcvhK3g" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/zMSxV9KcHv0" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  In July, we had new employees in the SMM department: copywriter Nikolai and 2 interns - Lisa and Vanya. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/9c3/c02/325/9c3c023251fc434a8e553e9f3d23227f.png" alt="image"><br>  <i><i>Nikolai - Copywriter</i></i> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/a23/4d5/2a8/a234d52a840f4c08a137aa6d5182b187.jpg" alt="image"><br>  <i><i>Vanya and Lisa are young assistants of the SMM department</i></i> <br><br>  And during these 2 months the SMM department released a pack of useful articles: <br><br><ul><li>  <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/company/logomachine/blog/332186/">"4 errors in business cards"</a> </li><li>  <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/company/logomachine/blog/333888/">‚ÄúHow to explain the design of a four-year-old?‚Äù</a> - translation of the article by designer Dean Whipond. </li><li>  <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/company/logomachine/blog/334112/">"Nike Brand Story"</a> </li><li>  <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/company/logomachine/blog/334566/">"7 ways to use blue in your company colors"</a> </li><li>  <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/company/logomachine/blog/334750/">"5 simple ways to spoil a font"</a> </li><li>  The article of our content manager in a personal blog is <a href="https://spark.ru/user/38428/blog/31120/4-priema-kontent-marketinga-kotorie-privlekut-vnimanie-k-vashemu-brendu">‚Äú4 content marketing receptions that will help draw attention to your brand</a> . <a href="https://spark.ru/user/38428/blog/31120/4-priema-kontent-marketinga-kotorie-privlekut-vnimanie-k-vashemu-brendu">‚Äù</a> </li><br><br>  That's all!
