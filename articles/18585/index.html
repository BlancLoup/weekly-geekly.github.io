      I have this question.  How does the Orthodox Church relate to the multidimensional and even infinite-dimensional spaces of Banach, Hubert in higher mathematics, as well as to Lobachevsky‚Äôs geometry, contrary to Euclidean geometry? <br><br>  Sincerely, Nikolai Antonov. <br><br>  Answer father Oleg Molenko: <br><br>  Nicholas, the Holy Church of Christ, which has always been, is and will be Orthodox, in no way refers to the multidimensional spaces of Banach, Hubert or Lobachevsky‚Äôs geometry.  The Church has its infinite and immeasurable space - the spiritual space or the spiritual world. <br><br>  Of course, the church people of each generation have one or another attitude to the various theories, hypotheses and discoveries arising from science and its representatives.  For example, here‚Äôs how Bishop Ignatius (Brianchaninov), one of the most educated people of his time, related to earth sciences: ‚ÄúScience!  Give me, if you can give something eternal, positive, give nothing inalienable and true, worthy to be called the property of man!  - Science was silent.  Following this great holy father, I can repeat with regard to the theories you mentioned: Banach, Gilbert and Lobachevsky with your theories, what can you give me and other people for their eternity?  Can your theories help people be saved?  Do they help piety and charity?  - Banach, Gilbert and Lobachevsky are silent.  And what can they say? <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Earthly science is based on the opinions of people and, as such, bears in itself all their weaknesses and delusions, brought to human nature by the fall.  That is why it is changeable, controversial, highly intelligent, unstable and unreliable.  Out of respect for the human mind (in fact, carnal wisdom and arrogance), it gathers various opinions of various "wise men" who are wise before themselves and are called in this world "scientists."  Some of them the world glorifies and calls them "outstanding scientists" or "luminaries of science."  We Christians are the disciples of Christ, and they are ‚Äúscientists‚Äù, i.e.  as if "gods" for other people.  Not only that these ‚Äúgods‚Äù often contradict each other, argue and quarrel with each other, because in their thinking and constructions they are so far removed from other people that their ‚Äúconstructions‚Äù can no longer be understood or verified. <br><br>  But even these scientists themselves do not dare to talk about their work as a divine revelation.  Shamefully evading God and His truth, they call their works theories, hypotheses and discoveries.  If Christians live by revelations, then scientists live by discoveries.  Revelations are any knowledge received from God.  Discoveries are knowledge about some elements or things of God's universe, obtained, albeit with the work of a scientist, but in a way of thieves.  After all, scientists discover only those properties, laws and laws that are created by God.  If a scientist understands this, recognizes and confesses publicly, then this is an honest scientist.  If a scientist does not see the Lawgiver behind the laws, but behind the Creator's creations, then this is a thief, a rogue and a liar. <br><br>  In addition to honesty, a scientist must clearly realize the limits of permissible and unacceptable in his research.  For this, he must be a Christian and always pray to God for enlightenment.  But at the same time, the work of an honest and God-fearing scientist is only of practical importance for this temporary life.  Scientific theories are free thinking about certain discoveries.  That is why they have no price or value for the Church.  Scientific hypotheses are a preserved lie that serves the father of lies to Satan.  Often theories and hypotheses become for many people a deadly poison.  This can be clearly seen from the history of the influence of the so-called Darwin's theory of the origin of species, which blasphemously claimed the lie that man was supposedly descended from a monkey.  How many countries and peoples remain poisoned by the poison of Darwinism to this day!  In this sense, the theory of Banach, Hilbert and Lobachevsky is not so dangerous for people.  Apparently, for this reason, Satan did not particularly promote them.  It is much more profitable for him to promote the nonsense of Nostradamus, rumors about aliens or the theory of the initial explosion.  ‚ÄúAt the beginning there was an explosion ...‚Äù - this is the beginning of the satanic revelation.  Apparently, therefore, his servants - demoniac revolutionaries and terrorists - so loved and love to blow up.  For them, the beginning and end is an explosion.  That is why I change the learned Banach to any unlearned, but praying monk! </blockquote><br><br>  ¬© <a href="http://www.omolenko.com/2516.html">www.omolenko.com/2516.html</a> <br></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/18585/">https://habr.com/ru/post/18585/</a></p>
