  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Psychological test to evaluate the IT product, or how Habrahabr is inferior to Facebook</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Did you try to evaluate your IT product from a psychological point of view?  Such an assessment can be based on general psychology and include ergonomic testing, can be based on cognitive psychology and use the theory of knowledge and decision making, can be based on activity theory and analyze user scenarios, can be based on psychology of learning and behaviorism and analyze the product from the point of view of gamification ... <br><br>  But a separate very important branch of psychology is the personality psychology, which includes theories of personal needs and psychological defenses.  Due to the complexity and the large number of sometimes conflicting concepts, this area is rarely used as a source of ideas and constraints when developing IT products.  However, the psychology of personality provides a lot of opportunities for understanding and predicting user behavior. <br><br>  I propose a variant of the methodology for evaluating an IT product, created on the basis of a compilation of various theories of personal needs. <br>  The test assesses how the product can meet the 10 most common needs of the individual. <br>  This test can be used not only to evaluate the product, but also as a <b>checklist</b> when searching for ideas in the development of IT products.

      <b>Description of the test.</b> <br>  For each need offered 5 questions about the product. <a name="habracut"></a>  A positive answer to the question +1 point, a negative answer 0 points.  Scoring is conducted for each need separately and in total for all 10 needs.  Accordingly, in the end, the product can get a maximum of 50 points (this assessment will most likely be in products that provide the best opportunities to meet the user's 10 personal needs). <br>  Needs for the convenience of analysis are combined into 3 blocks: sociality, emotions and activity. <br><br><habracut>  Social block <br>  <b>1.

The imposition of matrices of products allows you to compare them and make hypotheses about the reasons for the success of each. <br><br>  <b>Examples of profiles for different IT products:</b> <br><br>  1. Facebook (blue, 31 points) and Minesweeper (game Miner) (green, 17 points), where Miner shows a significant lag in social needs. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/bac/3f1/642/bac3f164290b6c3f30c003c2dbcda19c.jpg"><br><br>  2. Facebook (blue, 33 points) and Habrahabr (red, 38 points), where you can see Habrahabr‚Äôs lag in meeting the need for affiliation (rather, fear of being rejected) and fear of failure, but superiority in 5 other needs. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/532/e65/453/532e6545367bdd23087fb034cc6cf5ae.jpg"><br><br>  3. Habrahabr (red, 38 points) and Minesweeper (green, 17 points), where Miner‚Äôs lag in the satisfaction of almost all needs is clearly visible, except for fear of failure. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/acb/ad8/175/acbad81754ffa06132df965f1d73ae58.png"><br><br>  <b>Nb:</b> <br>  1. Evaluation of a product according to the formulations is subjective, at the discretion of the appraiser (it is desirable that the appraiser has an additional understanding of the theory of needs), therefore the final assessment can only be used approximately, so to speak, to start a conversation.  The reliability of the assessment is increased when using expert assessments. <br>  2. Is it worth it for the evaluator to know the product being evaluated well?  ‚ÄúIt depends on what kind of user perception you want to get.‚Äù <br>  (For example, the Habrahabr assessments presented here reflect a novice‚Äôs user experience and may differ from experienced users. But this difference in ratings can be a subject for user experience learning and adaptation.) <br>  2. This is the simplest version of the test, there are no multiplying factors for different types of needs for different product groups (for example, how much more important is the user to satisfy the need for power compared to the need for completeness), so it can be used for an initial approximate assessment of various IT -products. <br><br>  Your efficient comments and additions will be very useful to make the test more adequate and understandable. <br><br>  If you want to learn more about personal needs and how they determine people's behavior, you can look at classic books on this topic. <br>  Here are some: <br>  1. H. Heckhausen.  Motivation and activity <br>  2. D. McClelland.  Human motivation <br>  3. E. P. Il'in.  Motivation and motives <br>  Tamara Kulinkovich </habracut></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/165797/">https://habr.com/ru/post/165797/</a></p>
