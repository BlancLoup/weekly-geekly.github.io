Looking to the future (until 2020)</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/4b5/e69/327/4b5e693274614381b3ae0199e9e49c7c.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Speaking about trends in <a href="http://www.byyd.me/ru">mobile advertising</a> , we usually consider time perspectives from a couple of months to a year.  This is certainly good, but it is much more interesting what happens in three to five years. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  According to the <a href="">eMarketer</a> analysis, global spending on mobile advertising will rise to 94 billion dollars by 2018.  To this we can add that <a href="http://www.ericsson.com/res/docs/2013/ericsson-mobility-report-november-2013.pdf">Ericsson</a> predicts an increase in the volume of mobile traffic by 10 times by 2019 compared with today.  All signs indicate that mobile advertising will grow faster than we can imagine, and, as with other types of advertising, it needs to evolve and improve in order to withstand the test of time. <br><br>  Here are five trends in mobile advertising that can be implemented by 2020:

      <b>1. Mobile advertising with ‚ÄúDeep Links‚Äù</b> <br><br>  The ecosystem of mobile applications is not as connected as we would like.  Valuable data and links in applications can not be transferred from one to another.  This creates a problem for developers who want to ‚Äúunlock‚Äù the potential for additional income. <br><br>  ‚ÄúDeep Links‚Äù allow Application Developers to link specific content within their applications.  For example, mobile advertising of a restaurant network can lead directly to the page of a particular institution, instead of the main page of the network‚Äôs website or the first page of the application.  This is very important because it gives the user easy access to the information that he really wants to know, and this gives developers the opportunity to better interact with users. <br><br>  The difficulty of implementing ‚Äúdeep links‚Äù and the lack of standardization will be a serious challenge, but rational solutions for ‚Äúdeep links‚Äù have already been presented by companies such as Google and AppsFlyer.  By 2020, the content of mobile applications will no longer be "closed" within the application itself.  Applications will be freely linked as well as web pages now, and their developers will be able to send users inside their applications with just one click. <br><br>  ‚ÄúDeep links‚Äù became a missed topic, which will certainly be raised again as soon as the mobile industry realizes their importance and the extent of their influence on the development of the industry. <br><br>  <b>2. The emergence of hyper local advertising</b> <br><br>  What made mobile advertising successful and extremely attractive is targeting.  Targeting adds relevancy and increases the percentage of users involved.  Most companies in the high-tech advertising industry give advertisers the ability to target users by country, region, and city.  Such targeting attributes are paramount to the success of a mobile advertising campaign, but local targeting is even more important. <br><br>  Location data of a mobile user allows advertisers to advertise, based on maximum accuracy, up to several hundred meters.  This type of targeting allows you to attract customers at the moment of close proximity to the ‚Äúpoint of sale‚Äù.  These case studies from <a href="http://www.thinknear.com/library/category/research/by-type/case-studies/">Thinknear</a> show how brands can benefit from hyper-local mobile advertising. <br><br>  The mobile advertising industry is not yet fully exploiting the full potential of geotargeting.  Right now there are only a few companies that make hypertargeting advertising campaigns really good.  Over the next few years, the industry will make efforts to create more clarity and transparency around location data, and to create more accurate hyper-local advertising tools.  Brands will be able to increase involvement in their offline sales points with highly targeted mobile ads and significantly increase the visibility of national campaigns with local data.  In addition, this information will be available to all advertisers, large and small. <br><br>  <b>3. Best metrics for post-click and offline behavior</b> <br><br>  It is very difficult to track what happens after the click, offline.  We are still stuck in the times of recording impressions and CTR.  And while these metrics are very important, they are not smart enough, especially for brands that want to move forward with mobile advertising. <br><br>  In the September 2014 report, <a href="http://www.xad.com/press-releases/xad-study-reveals-ctr-poor-indicator-mobile-ad-campaign-performance">xAd</a> , one of the leaders in accurate geo-targeting, demonstrated that "CTR is a poor indicator of the success of a mobile advertising campaign."  The real metric of success of such a campaign for brands will be post-click and offline user behavior. <br><br>  By 2020, advertisers will focus their interest on post-click and offline metrics, such as: the flow of visits to the store and the rate of calls made. <br><br>  <b>4. Widespread programmatic</b> <br><br>  We can already see how the programmatic technologies successfully provide a massive and accurate purchase of banner advertising.  At the same time, advertisers are discovering all new advertising formats, such as native and video advertising, and they need the same successful tools to post them.  And besides, advertisements should scale easily and adapt to any type of device.  By 2020, advertisers will be able to use any advertising format, regardless of size, including for native and video advertising.  Although the native programmatic and video advertising is just emerging, it is growing very fast. <br><br>  <b>5. One-click purchase / Tap-To-Buy Ads (click on ads and buy)</b> <br><br>  This will not happen without ‚Äúdeep links‚Äù, but an instant purchase is what e-commerce is heading towards.  Now clicking on mobile advertising takes the user through a series of pages before he can finally make a purchase.  ‚ÄúI‚Äôve clicked on ads and bought‚Äù will allow you to see the details of the advertised product / service and make a purchase right from one mobile ad. <br><br>  ‚ÄúTap-to-buy mobile ad‚Äù will be very similar in functionality to <i>1-Click</i> from Amazon and <i>Apple Pay</i> from Apple, where the user will be given the opportunity to make a purchase with one touch. <br><br>  Some of these things may happen soon, even in this decade.  In any case, mobile advertising such as we know it today, will not be, by 2020 it will become completely different.  We still have a long way to go, and we will update this article as new trends and trends appear. <br><br> <a href="http://www.byyd.me/ru/register/%3Futm_source%3Dmegamozg%26utm_medium%3Dpost%26utm_campaign%3Dcontent_marketing"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/041/3c5/29a/0413c529a1424210a02b160e54a40e80.png"></a> <br><br>  <a href="http://www.byyd.me/ru/%3Futm_source%3Dmegamozg">BYYD ‚Ä¢ Mobile Advertising Platform</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/292426/">https://habr.com/ru/post/292426/</a></p>
