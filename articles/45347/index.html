Michelle Delio of MacLife has <a href="http://www.maclife.com/article/feature/how_survive_17_worst_mac_disasters" title="How to Survive the 17 Worst Mac Disasters">compiled a</a> list of the most critical moments on Mac and will tell you how to fix them and avoid such troubles in the future. <br><br>  No computer works flawlessly.  Even Macs can sometimes behave absurdly, suddenly refusing to work like well-educated, charming cars that we know and love.

      In this case, if the PC can be completely harmful, Macs are rarely malicious.  Usually they work poorly only if they are provoked.  For example, if you spill a drink on a macbook keyboard or do not perform basic care functions.  Sometimes, just like people, Macs get tired and overworked, and they just need a little attention and care. <br><br>  If disaster strikes the Poppy, most often the problem can be solved on its own.  This is if you are just lucky, and the causes and consequences are obvious.  For example, if you update the operating system, and the application refuses to work correctly, the logic tells you that the application will also need an update.  Sometimes, in order to mitigate the effect of a disaster on a Mac, you will have to take a few key steps, starting with the most obvious, which are easiest to cope with (for example, checking if your computer is properly connected to the network) to more complex ones.  In any case, keep yourself in hand. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/319/d50/245/319d50245a1f841c483336d7554ca540.jpg" alt="How to Survive 17 Worst Mac Disasters: Chaper One"><br><br>  This article presents 17 tactics, the adherence to which will help relive some of the most common disasters that can befall your Mac, iPhone or iPod, from the most serious to the most annoying.  If you have any doubts about what to do with the problem, it is always better not to enter unknown territory, in order not to make things worse.  In such cases, it is better to just take the car to a professional.  And do not forget to regularly backup important data.  If you do not backup, even a small problem can turn into a huge crisis.  By the way, Leopard users, you already have a tool for easy and convenient backup: Time Machine built-in OS, so excuses are not accepted from you!  You can find step-by-step instructions on how to back up your main files in the article ‚Äú <a href="http://www.maclife.com/backup" title="How to Back Up Your Mac with Time Machine">How to Back Up Your Mac with Time Machine</a> ‚Äù. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br><h2>  Disaster 1: Keyboard, Meet the Beer </h2><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/3e2/f46/e3d/3e2f46e3d089128f874ef7cc566a6ad6.jpg" alt="DrinkDifferent"><br><br>  <strong>TACTICS OF SURVIVAL:</strong> If you accidentally introduce your MacBook keyboard to a drink or other liquid, you will have to act very quickly to save the typewriter.  Unplug the power cord immediately and remove the battery.  Then turn the laptop upside down, leaving the lid partially open, hinged up, the keyboard down so that the liquid can drain.  Do not turn it back and do not lay it flat.  Put paper napkins or cloth towels under the laptop to soak up the liquid, and change them as needed. <br><br>  After everything that you spilled on it pours out of the car, do not turn it on for three days or even longer, if you want it to dry completely before switching on.  Some people use a hair dryer in such cases to speed up the drying process, but drying the inside of your MacBook with a hair dryer can only make it worse: the ingredients that were in the spilled liquid can stick to the fragile computer components, so it‚Äôs better to allow the liquid to self-dry in air. <br><br>  If you really need data that is stored on your hard drive, and you can pay about $ 600 (in the US), contact the data recovery company for speed after disconnecting the computer from the network.  Just before you do not forget to ask how they should better send the laptop: in such a state as it is, or it is better to dry it first. <br><br>  If you have a backup copy of your information (and it should be; read "5 ways to prevent disasters on the Mac") and you just want to see if the Mac can save, let it dry completely, turn it on and see if it starts boot up  You can also take it to the Apple Store or local service center for a preliminary check.  Just keep in mind that damage from spilled liquid or food ingress is not covered by the warranty, and yes, they can find out what happened, so do not pretend and say that "the computer just stopped working."  <em>In the new unbodi macbook, there are special <a href="http://haywired.ru/2008/spil_detection_in_new_macbooks/" title="Liquid spill detectors added to new MacBooks">immersion sensors</a> for detecting similar causes of malfunction, as in all iPods and iPhones.</em> <br><br>  If you choose the ‚Äúhelp yourself‚Äù path, and your already dried computer turns on, your next step will depend on what you spilled on the machine.  Regular room temperature water is the least likely to cause you problems in the long run.  Ice water on a hot motherboard is a very bad combination;  Your computer is most likely to burn out on contact.  A poppy can survive contact with sweet, sour or milk drinks, but it can almost be said with certainty that problems will begin to manifest later when the remaining liquid slowly eats away the insides of your computer.  Once you have verified that your computer is running, it should be quickly cleaned.  If you are completely sure that you can disassemble the computer, lubricate any sticky parts with distilled water or denatured alcohol (it is sold in technical stores), and then assemble it all correctly, then go ahead.  If not, take it to the Apple Store or local computer equipment for thorough cleaning. <br><br>  If you wet a peripheral keyboard that works with a MacPro or iMac, immediately disconnect the keyboard from the computer and turn it over to let the liquid flow out.  Let it dry from day to two (depending on how much liquid you spilled), and then reconnect it.  Most likely, you still killed the keyboard, but it is worth seeing, maybe it survived.  Unless you have spilled a large amount of liquid on the Mac too, everything should be fine with your computer. <br><br><h2>  Distress 2: Stuck in Start Mode </h2><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/afe/fca/dd1/afefcadd1c0e969cde361a46b654c317.jpg" alt="MacBook Stuck on StartUp Screen"><br><br>  <strong>TACTICS OF SURVIVAL:</strong> If your Mac simulator pretends to be sick, to avoid performing his duties, does not want to move on to the screen with the apple logo for an hour or so and start the troubleshooting process by turning off the computer and take a few deep breaths. <br><br>  Now press the power button and immediately press and hold the <strong>Cmd + S (+ S)</strong> buttons until the machine starts to boot.  This will load the single-user mode, and you should see the white text on the screen. <br><br>  When you see a prompt that you can enter a command, type <strong>/ sbin / fsck ‚Äìfy</strong> (‚Äúfsck‚Äù is a file system consistency checker) and press Return <em>(‚Ü© is the equivalent of the Enter key).</em>  Now sit back and allow Mac to try to find and solve the problem that torments him.  It may take about 15 minutes or more if everything is very bad there, so be patient.  If you are lucky and you see the message: <em>‚ÄúThe file system has been modified‚Äù (‚ÄúFile System has been modified‚Äù)</em> , repeat the above procedure again until you see the message: <em>‚ÄúProblems not detected‚Äù (‚ÄúNo problems were found ")</em> .  When this happens, type the <strong>reboot</strong> on the keyboard and press the <strong>Return</strong> key <strong>(‚Ü©)</strong> again. <br><br>  If these steps do not help you get out of the swampy swamps of the boot process, locate the OS X installation disk and insert it into the drive.  This time hold the C key when the Mac loads.  If you are using OS 10.4 or newer, go to <em>\ Applications \ Utilities \ Disk Utility (\ Applications \ Utilities \ Disk Utility)</em> , select your hard disk in the left panel and click the <em>Repair Disk</em> button in the <em>First Aid</em> section. <em>Aid)</em> .  If no disk errors are detected, click <em>Repair disk permissions</em> .  When this process is complete, restart your Mac. <br><br>  If you are working on OS 10.2, you can do the same steps, but you will find what you need in the <em>Ist√ºller \ Open Disk Utility</em> section. <br><br>  <em>If that doesn't help, you can try <a href="http://www.alsoft.com/DiskWarrior/index.html" title="Diskwarerior">DiskWarrior</a> ($ 99.95) from Alsoft.</em>  <em>The price for the program is not small, but if the data is more important to you, it is worth trying.</em>  <em>According to the developers, DiskWarrior is able to do what other programs cannot: instead of correcting the original directory, it uses a special technology that allows you to quickly create a new directory.</em>  <em>For this program uses data recovered from the original directory.</em>  <em>Thus, it can recover files, folders and documents that you already thought lost, since no other program could recover them.</em>  <em>Many thanks to <a href="http://bondarua.habrahabr.ru/" title="bondarua">bondarua</a> for the advice.</em> <br><br>  If all of the above does not work, you may have to pass your computer to the care of Apple experts. <br><br><h2>  Disaster 3: Does not turn on </h2><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/aec/f6c/70c/aecf6c70cd044e2e498cc6821b52b645.jpg" alt="Power Button on Mac"><br><br>  <strong>TACTICS OF SURVIVAL:</strong> If you press the Power button and do not hear the melodies at the start, the power indicator does not light up, and you do not hear any sounds from the hard disk or Mac fan, disconnect the power cord, remove the battery (if it is a laptop), disconnect all peripheral devices (printer, scanner and others) and slowly count to 60. Reinsert the battery, connect the power cable and see if the machine turns on as usual.  If yes, then you can connect your peripheral devices one at a time and rejoice - you have prevented trouble. <br><br>  If this tactic does not work, disconnect the computer from the power supply and again remove the battery.  Now try resetting the System Management Controller.  The fact is that if the settings of the system management controller are damaged, your Mac will not be able to recognize its battery and / or power source.  On a MacBook or MacBook Pro, hold down the power button (Power) for 5 seconds, then plug in the adapter and press the power button, after which we hope the computer will turn on.  For other mobile Macs, you will need to take slightly different steps.  For example, on MacBook Air, you will need to press <strong>Shift + Control + Option (‚áß + ‚åÉ +)</strong> on the left of the keyboard and hold down the power button.  For other Mac models, visit the Support section on the Apple website or search Google for the ‚ÄúSMC + model of your Mac‚Äù to learn how to reset the controller's control settings. <br><br>  <em>According to the Russian Apple Community users, resetting the SMC will also help solve the common problem of constantly running MacBook Air fans.</em>  <em>After resetting the machine does not know, it works quietly and silently.</em> <br><br><h2>  Disaster 4: It's just too slow. </h2><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/593/69f/c9c/59369fc9c6055c62e2723e21dc7185e8.jpg" alt="Slow macbook"><br><br>  <strong>TACTICS OF SURVIVAL:</strong> If your Mac is ‚Äúnot the same‚Äù ¬© (in the sense that it is not the little cheeky speed demon, as before), it is likely that this is your fault.  If you have downloaded a lot of toolbars and applications that you rarely use, and your desktop is littered with folders and icons, it's time to start cleaning.  Submit to the dump software that you do not use, collect all the folders and icons into one folder.  Every thing on your desktop eats up a small piece of memory, so it‚Äôs worth all this to organize and put into one folder in which all the other folders you have will be stored.  Consider turning off useless, but cool features, such as system animation, zoom effects, and scroll bars that absorb system resources.  The easiest way to do this is to download <a href="" title="TinkerTool">TinkerTool</a> (2.2 MB), a free application that allows you to change all the settings in OS X to your complete pleasure. <br><br>  Also think about your Mac's sleep habits.  OS X comes with a set of UNIX scripts that run automatically at 3:15 am every day, weekly at 4:30 am on Saturdays and monthly at 5:30 am on the first day of the month.  If your machine is usually turned off or in sleep mode at this time (the UNIX machines for which these scripts were originally designed were always turned on), the cluttering system will accumulate in temporary directories, and your Mac will not work as fast as should.  Try to see if you can, so that your machine will be turned on in most cases at the time at which these scripts are scheduled to run.  If you are working on Leopard, then these scripts will run automatically during the next boot.  Alternatively, you can change the programmed script time using paid utilities such as <a href="http://www.maintain.se/downloads/leopard.html" title="Cocktail">Cocktail</a> ($ 14.95, 1.8 MB) or <a href="" title="Leopard Cache Cleaner">Leopard Cache Cleaner</a> ($ 8.99, 12.8 MB). <br><br>  <em>Thanks to the advice of <a href="http://vadimua.habrahabr.ru/" title="VadimUA on Habr√©">VadimUA,</a> I can tell you about the free Optimizer application that will clean up your Mac and grab your homemade Leopard or Tiger hair.</em>  <em>The application has no graphical interface, there is only an icon in the dock and voice alerts in English, which it uses to report to you on the work done.</em>  <em>This wonderful little utility runs the above UNIX scripts, which bring order to the system.</em>  <em>Before starting the scripts, you will need to enter a password for your account.</em>  <em>The author <a href="http://blog.ibrain.com.ua/2008/09/%25D0%25B2%25D1%258B%25D1%2587%25D1%2591%25D1%2581%25D1%258B%25D0%25B2%25D0%25B0%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BC-%25D1%2588%25D0%25B5%25D1%2580%25D1%2581%25D1%2582%25D1%258C-leopard%25D1%2583-optimaze-v11/" title="Vychesyvayem wool Leopard">advises</a> to save all the important data and close other applications, because after running the scripts, the utility will reboot the system.</em>  <em>Optimizer has two versions: for Mac OS 10.5 ( <a href="" title="Leopard Optimizer 1.1">Leopard Optimizer 1.1</a> , 71.7 KB) and 10.4 ( <a href="" title="Tiger Optimizer 1.0">Tiger Optimizer 1.0</a> , 381 KB).</em> <br><br>  <em>The version for Leopard runs the following commands:</em> <br><br><pre>  rm -rf /System/Library/Extensions.mkext;

In such cases, your Mac may die a slow death from overheating. <br><br>  To solve this problem, it is usually necessary to open the computer case and blow out dirt with a can of compressed air.  If you have a Mac that you can open (look at the set of cogs near the vents that allow you to remove the fan cover panel), and you are sure that you can do it yourself, then you probably already know what to do next.  Carefully disassemble the computer and blow out all the dirt.  If such a close relationship with a computer does not seem like fun to you, take it to the Apple Store and have it done for you there.  You can ask the technicians to show you how this is done correctly so that you can perform this procedure yourself about once every three months.  If you just want to clean the air vents and the fan from dust, but do not plan to go so far and actually open the case, then make sure that you do not blow the dust deeper into the computer.  To do this, direct the nozzle of the can of compressed air to the outside.  If you blow the dust deeper into the car, it will only aggravate the problem. <br><br>  Apple says some MacBooks have a thin layer of clear plastic that can cover the back vent.  It was used in the factory to keep dust from entering the computer, and it had to be removed before being sent from the factory, but some MacBooks came with this plastic.  If your MacBook plastic closes the ventilation, remove it and discard it.  Also make sure that the vents of your computer are not blocked by other things that are located on your desk, or that they are not closed partly due to the fact that the macbook rests on such soft surfaces as pillows, or on your lap.  Your computer also needs to breathe. <br><br><h2>  Disaster 6: The application is crazy </h2><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/4b9/43d/a7e/4b943da7e7f5a03af467f898a5dec5f9.jpg" alt="App goes Haywire"><br><br>  <strong>TACTICS OF SURVIVAL:</strong> If an application that has always been obedient, suddenly begins to hang or somehow be capricious, think about what you could do to upset it.  Maybe you downloaded and installed a system update, a new software or something else changed on the computer?  You will probably also need to update the harmful program so that it behaves well again. <br><br>  If nothing has changed, check if the settings are to blame.  Go to the <em>Accounts</em> section <em>in System Preferences</em> and create a new user account.  Log in as a new user and run the program that was causing you problems.  If nothing bad happens, chances are that the problem is in your personal program settings.  In some cases, you can delete settings by dragging them from the <em>Users / Libraries / Preferences</em> folder <em>(Users / Library / Preferences)</em> .  In programs such as Photoshop, you can reset your account settings to the default by pressing <strong>Command + Option + Shift (‚åò + ‚å• + ‚áß)</strong> when launching the application;  when Photoshop starts up, it asks if you want to reset the settings.  Do not forget to save custom presets before you reset Photoshop.  If you do not know how to restore the default settings of any program, find out on the manufacturer‚Äôs website. <br><br>  Damaged fonts can also cause severe damage to applications and even entire operating systems.  In point # 14 you will find some tips on how to deal with them. <br><br>  Finally, it is worth considering problems with RAM (RAM or RAM).  If your applications start to behave eccentric and fall for no obvious reason, you may have a bad RAM module.  If you can get to RAM on your machine, which you can usually do on most modern Macs, except for the MacBook Air, and there is more than one module installed, try removing one module from the computer.  If this does not help, try moving one module to another slot.  Then repeat the operation with the second module: perhaps the problem is in one of the ‚Äúslats‚Äù. <br><br><h2>  Disaster 7: Mack scratched </h2><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/31d/f71/9f5/31df719f519fbd67ce55e42807358422.jpg" alt="Scratched Apple"><br><br>  <strong>TACTICS OF SURVIVAL:</strong> Metal is scratched - it's just a fact of life.  The first scratch that damaged the body of your Titanium PowerBook or MacBook Pro was probably the most traumatic.  When the originally smooth surface is already slightly scratched, all these marks are much easier to tolerate.  But if you simply cannot see these attritions as signs of an interesting well-lived life, ignore any temptations to discover ‚ÄúBrasso‚Äù <em>(the brand name for metal products from Reckitt &amp; Colman)</em> .  It is well-suited for repairing broken iPods, but can remove the cover from the casing of your MacBook Pro.  You can search for a lacquer that removes scratches that are made specifically for the metal from which your computer case is made, just carefully follow the instructions.  Obviously, you make sure that nothing sticky is near the ventilation holes, ports and recesses in the case, and disconnect the battery and power adapter before starting the process of getting rid of scratches.  If the case of your MacBook Pro is only heavily soiled and not damaged by scratches, try using the <a href="http://www.klearscreen.com/iKlear.aspx" title="Apple Polish Cleaning Kit by iKlear">Apple Polish Cleaning Kit</a> ($ 24.95) from iKlear to make it shine like new. <br><br>  <em><a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/apple/45944/" title="Poppies Survival Guide.
