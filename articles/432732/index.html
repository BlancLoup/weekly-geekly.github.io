Introduction)</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Hello! <br><br>  I am the author of <a href="https://habr.com/post/248943/">this article</a> .  And it's time to write a sequel ... after almost 4 years. <br><br>  At the time of writing of the last article I was a college student, now I am a university student.  At the time of this writing, I was working as a waitress, now I am managing 1C introductions in an organization that deals with the implementation and maintenance of 1C in government institutions.  But I did not come to brag, I want to share my experience with you, dear reader.  Every day I‚Äôm looking for something on the net, and I‚Äôve found my today's post 2.5 years ago, when I started working with 1C, my life would be much simpler.  But, on the other hand, then I would not have received this precious experience, because as you know, from what we remember during the day, most of it is our personal experience, and only a small one is what we read, especially where is online.  But I sincerely hope that you will read and this will help you, maybe a little, but you will still think about where to begin the work on implementation.  Go.

      What will I share?  Their conclusions, based on several implementations.  It does not matter that you are implementing, with whom you are doing it, in what organization - these conclusions are suitable for any process. <a name="habracut"></a><br>  <b>Conclusion 1.</b> Always define the areas of responsibility of the client, its employees and their own.  What has its own and customer documented. <br><br>  <b>Conclusion 2.</b> Try to determine the person responsible from the client for the implementation.  This employee will be your right hand in case of conflict situations between you and your employees and between employees.  In the absence of such a person to warn the client about the risks. <br><br>  <b>Conclusion 3.</b> Prior to the maximum to study the features of the organization. <br><br>  <b>Conclusion 4.</b> Know and study the subject area.  When we talk about universities: understand what reports and why are dealt with, what uniform systems will need to be exchanged, know business processes.  Also with accounting - they see you as a professional, you should be guided in the legislation. <br><br>  <i>‚ÄúYou don't pay for plumbing for piping, but for understanding exactly where you need to beat‚Äù</i> - the author is unknown, she couldn‚Äôt google it. <br><br>  Example.  In all universities there are: exchanges with the FIS GIA and admission, monitoring and report "VPO-1", but only in medical there is an exchange with federal registers.  And it is very valuable when you are up to date and can offer your services to solve this problem. <br><br>  <b>Conclusion 5.</b> Ask questions to the client.  Is always.  Yes, you are an implementer, yes, you all know, but you are not working here.  To be ashamed of not knowing the whole client system, the whole order of interaction is a waste of time.  Where to quickly ask if it concerns the specifics of their work. <br><br>  Of course, I can write a lot more conclusions.  And not only about how to start, but also about how to act in the process, how to resolve conflicts and how to avoid them, how to find high-quality employees and how to say goodbye to those who do not work at 200%.  And about many other things.  I just need to know what's important to you.  Write about it in the comments. <br><br>  Thank. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/432732/">https://habr.com/ru/post/432732/</a></p>
