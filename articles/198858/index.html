On Habr√© there are a little more than three ( <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/165511/">one</a> , <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/175741/">two</a> , <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/177909/">three</a> , <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/180739/">four</a> ) detailed and detailed articles on the procedure for obtaining and using the card.  There is also the official <a href="http://www.uecard.ru/">site of the project</a> , describing in detail what it is and where it is needed. <br><br>  In this article, I propose to look at the chronology of the project and discuss its future in a planned, religious and fantastic aspects. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h4>  Some applied history </h4><br>  <b>July 2010</b> is a boring, but important, <a href="http://base.garant.ru/12177515/">Law No. 210-</a> , which defines the universal electronic card. <br>  <b>February 2011</b> - Dmitry Medvedev held a <a href="http://kremlin.ru/news/10453">meeting with a long-named commission</a> dedicated to the introduction of a universal electronic card. <br>  <b>2011, June, 17</b> - UEC management signed an agreement with MasterCard, which received partner status in project implementation. <br>  <b>October 2011</b> - Dmitry Medvedev signed a decree on applying a universal state emblem on a universal electronic card.  It also turned out that there were difficulties in the implementation of the Inter-Agency Electronic Interaction System (SMEV), the launch date of which is postponed to mid-2012.  And without launching this system, it is pointless to issue a card.  The deadline for issuing a universal electronic card was postponed to January 1, 2013.  It was also decided to use only the Russian payment system PRO100 in the UEC, excluding the participation of the international payment systems Visa and MasterCard (they have been deployed since June).  And in Sberbank they promised "to neutralize the lobbyists of international payment systems in the Russian authorities." <br>  <b>2011, December, 31</b> - it became known that Russian companies do not have time to produce a microprocessor by 2012 (and the chip for biometric passports of a citizen of the Russian Federation created by Russian manufacturers several years ago apparently had a <a href="http://lurkmore.to/%25D0%25A4%25D0%25B0%25D1%2582%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BB%25D1%258C%25D0%25BD%25D1%258B%25D0%25B9_%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B5%25D0%25B4%25D0%25BE%25D1%2581%25D1%2582%25D0%25B0%25D1%2582%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BA">fatal flaw</a> ).  The FSB considers it dangerous to use a foreign-made microprocessor in the card.  In the light of the last phrase, a political decision was suddenly made temporarily, in 2012, to use a foreign-made microprocessor. <br>  <b>2012, February</b> - in nine pilot regions of Russia, the issuance of a card was started, in order to check how it works in practice. <br>  <b>2012, February, 16</b> - ‚ÄúUEC Rules of Use‚Äù were published, which set forth unconfirmed information about ‚Äúfalse pin codes, the introduction of which will allow to gain time and provide prompt assistance to a citizen from law enforcement agencies.‚Äù <br>  <b>2012, the middle</b> - the developers feverishly finish the SMEV, the launch is postponed to the evening. <br>  <b>2012, September</b> - it became known that the technologies that are used and tested in the UEC will be used in an electronic passport, which is planned to be released in a few years. <br>  <b>November 2012</b> - the <a href="http://www.uecard.ru/ratings-analytics/">monitoring of the readiness</a> of Russian regions for the launch of the project was launched on the official website of UEC. <br>  <b>November 2012</b> - project implementation status by 16 points - from 13% to 40% in different regions; <br>  <b>2012, December</b> - an order was issued that all multifunctional centers providing state and municipal services should be equipped with readers for universal electronic cards. <br>  <b>2012, December</b> - project implementation status by 16 points - from 20% to 80% in different regions; <br>  <b>2013, January</b> - certification of microprocessors for universal electronic cards produced by the Russian company NIIME and Micron was completed.  The card began to issue citizens of Russia on the application.  President of UEC OJSC Alexei Popov said that the card uses the CryptoPro electronic signature. <br>  <b>2013, January</b> - project implementation status by 16 points - from 26% to 100% in different regions; <br>  <b>2013, February</b> - it became known that in parts of the regions of the Russian Federation there is not enough money to ensure the production and issuance of cards.  Sberbank made a decision to become a shareholder of regional authorized organizations, which will allow financing their work. <br>  <b>2013, February, 4</b> - the Orthodox Church expressed serious concern about the introduction of a single lifelong personal identifier. <br>  <b>2013, February</b> - the status of the project implementation by 16 points - from 53% to 100% in different regions; <br>  <b>2013, spring</b> - the issuance of regional social cards is terminated.  Instead, they will be issued a universal electronic card. <br>  <b>2013, March</b> - project implementation status by 16 points - from 66% to 100% in different regions; <br>  <b>2013, April</b> - Vice-President of JSC UEC Vadim Shchepinov said that from 2014 it is planned to leave only the issuance of UEC on applications and to cancel the mandatory issuance in connection with the issuance of an e-passport in the future. <br>  <b>2013, April</b> - status of the project implementation by 16 points - from 66% to 100% in different regions (yes, something Altai podzastryal); <br>  <b>2013, May</b> - status of the project implementation by 16 points - no information (probably, Altai sabotaged); <br>  <b>2013, August</b> - the status of the project implementation by 16 points - information continues to be absent - probably, everything is ready; <br>  <b>2013, September</b> - the <a href="http://ueconline.ru/">UEC-Online</a> portal was opened for identification of citizens and payment for public services.  Citizens can register on the portal using the UEC using a card reader.  It is possible to purchase insurance policies fully in electronic form: a qualified electronic signature placed on the UEC is used to enter into an insurance contract. <br>  <b>2013, September, 16</b> - action for the first 50,000 thousand applicants - a card reader as a gift (those thousands who submitted an application before this date, apparently, bite their elbows to each other). <br>  <b>2013, September, 27</b> - a government order was issued, where it is stated that UEC is responsible for the infrastructure for accepting a new e-passport and for compatibility of this infrastructure with the infrastructure of a universal electronic card that is being built now. <br>  <b>2013, September, 30</b> - issued about 10,000 UEC (and released more than 120,000). <br>  <b>2013, October</b> - in the Yaroslavl region they issued a 1000 card, in Tula now you can pay for travel with a universal card, and in Tambov, on the 15th, 49 cards were issued (and this is with the total number of cards issued in this city - 1595; 15 months, or a month unsuccessful).

      For those who missed the summary above: they harnessed for a long time - they drove quickly.  At the moment, in all regions you can get a map in about a month, and in some you can already use it as a travel card.  It's a pity that card readers issue not all to the cards (write down in the comments, by the way, who received - what is the model, how is the receiving process).  At the same time, an infrastructure for the implementation of electronic passports is being built on the basis of the UEC. <br><br><h4>  Planned future of the project </h4><br>  <b>2013, December, 16</b> - it will be possible to issue a medical policy and pension certificate in electronic form. <br>  <b>2014, January, 1</b> - in accordance with Article 26 of the Law No. 210-FZ, it was planned to issue a card to all citizens, except those who refused to receive it.  To cancel the card, you must write a statement.  But in the course of the project implementation, it turned out that by default a citizen cannot issue a card - a personal presence of a citizen is required before the production of a card is started for photographing and recording a signature sample.  The personal presence of a citizen is also required to receive a card and an envelope with pin codes. <br>  <b>2014, January, 1</b> - applications for UEC should be received at the Multifunctional Centers, as well as on the basis of regional insurance companies. <br>  <b>2015, January, 1</b> - the date of commencement of the mandatory issuance of a universal electronic card (and also an electronic passport, according to the decision of the RF Government Commission on the use of information technology) <br>  <b>January 2025</b> - it is planned to discontinue the issue of currently existing paper passports. <br>  <b>January 2030</b> - it is assumed that all old-style certificates will expire. <br><br>  In fact, there are not so many plans, but everyone is global.  As always with plans, I would not focus on specific dates, but the motion vector is clearly visible.  According to him, UEC is an intermediate link between paper documents and a single electronic passport containing all the necessary information about a person.  In this vein, it is extremely important now to roll in the infrastructure on universal electronic maps and prepare the society for changes. <br><br><h4>  Religious aspect </h4><br>  But some members of this very society are dissatisfied and resist change.  In the front ranks are people who identify themselves as believers: they see in all this signs of the activity of the antipode of God.  No, I‚Äôm not saying that all believers are that way, but the leadership of the Orthodox Church has repeatedly <a href="http://protivkart.org/main/2199-poziciya-cerkvi-v-svyazi-s-razvitiem-tehnologiy-ucheta-i-obrabotki-personalnyh-dannyh.html">expressed their concerns</a> , and the statements of some fans stifle the mood of people with a simple persecution mania. <br><br>  Nevertheless, it is obvious that when applied to a universal electronic map, all their excitements are completely groundless.  Or, to be more exact, they are just as justified as the unrest that arose when passports were introduced in Tsarist Russia.  By itself, the UEC does not bring anything new - now just a series of documents can be collected in one physical medium: a travel card, a unique e-mail identifier, a SNILS, a credit card, a driver's license. <br><br>  As for ‚Äúnumbers instead of names‚Äù and ‚Äúrecount all people, assigning each a number for life‚Äù, there are plenty of such numbers now: SNILS, TIN, passport, OMC, IP, ICQ, phone number, in the end.  Some of them change several times in life, and some - for life.  However, this does not cause much excitement of fanatics and paranoids. <br><br>  Therefore, I would regard all movements of the church or some of its representatives with respect to the UEC as an attempt to find a place for myself in the new information society.  As a result, their task is to harmoniously link the new conditions with established doctrines.  I believe that they will succeed, and the church will continue to help and give relief to its parishioners, even with universal electronic cards. <br><br><h4>  Fantastic aspect </h4><br>  Here paranoics appear on the scene.  They believe that with the help of the UEC and the UEC-like initiatives, the state will take us "under the hood."  He will monitor every step, know everything about us and look into our closet while we put our skeletons in there. <br><br>  <a href="http://lurkmore.to/ZOG">I have bad news for them</a> .  Now we leave so many traces of information at every step that only the laziest will not be able to find this information.  With our credit cards, cell phones, emails, you can follow our every step.  Yes, surely each of us has such friends, who are so actively noted in tweeters, foreclocks, facebook, that you would be glad that they have more paranoia. <br><br>  In general, when it comes to surveillance in this aspect, people appeal to the <a href="http://www.minpromtorg.gov.ru/ministry/strategic/sectoral/11">Strategy for the development of the electronic industry of Russia for the period up to 2025</a> dated August 7, 2007, where the paragraph is met: ‚Äúnanoelectronics will integrate with biological objects and provide continuous control over the maintenance of their vital activity, improvement quality of life, and thus reduce the social costs of the state. "It is after this paragraph that people imagine that UEC will grow into an electronic chip that will be introduced to people in the most unexpected places  body.  And through this chip, Putin will know everything about you.  Yes, yes, about you, the person reading these lines is sitting in an office chair in front of the LCD monitor, working in the IT field, two parents, a pet, a satisfactory state of health ... <br><br>  These fears are also not justified.  First of all, in order to transfer data for at least some large distances, you will have to carry a battery of normal size to this chip, as if from the well-known storyline of Yeralash.  Secondly, and this is more significant, there will be millions of medical and not very reasons why it will not be possible to implant a chip in a person himself in some specific cases.  And because of these cases, the implantation itself cannot be mandatory.  It looks much more real that all documents will degenerate into some kind of physical medium that will be comfortable to keep with you, but you can just as calmly and leave at home.  For example, a ring / medallion / bracelet - and the person will always have a choice: to carry this device with them, or leave it on the table and rush off in the field naked - free and elusive. <br><br><h4>  And what about them? </h4><br>  They - this, of course, abroad. <br><br>  To date, more than 50 countries are developing and producing electronic documents.  Here are some of them. <br><br>  <b>Singapore was</b> one of the first in the world in the early 2000s to introduce electronic passports for its residents, combining identity cards and a universal key for public services on one card. <br><br>  The <b>Malaysia</b> map contains an identification application, banking application, driver's license, medical information and transportation applications. <br><br>  Geldkarte in <b>Germany</b> allows you to access public and commercial services, sign documents with an electronic signature ( <b>UPD:</b> for more on the map of Germany, see the <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/198858/">Comment CodeRush</a> , thank him for it). <br><br>  <b>Estonian</b> ID-card is an identity card and is <s>used to store virtual travel tickets on public transport,</s> contains an electronic signature that allows you to sign documents and comments on the Internet, is used for identification on Internet elections ( <b>UPD:</b> for more information on Estonian maps, see <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/198858/">timukas comment</a> , thanks him for him). <br><br>  And, as far as I know, in none of these countries has a portal to hell opened, and they live quite happily. <br><br><h4>  Instead of the total </h4><br>  Now it is somehow customary to criticize and comment.  My article is positive.  I am an optimistic person and I think that the right innovations need public approval and support.  A universal electronic card - just such an innovation.  And as an intermediate step to the electronic passport, and as an aggregator of many documents in one medium.  And then these situations are already boring: ‚Äúyou didn‚Äôt see my insurance, it‚Äôs not with the rest of the documents‚Äù, ‚Äúyou forgot to bring more SNILS to other documents‚Äù, ‚Äúyes, to enter the state portal you must fill in the authorization form and the session key will come to you by mail.
