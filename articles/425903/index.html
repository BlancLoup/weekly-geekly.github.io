True, no one knows what this means, since the technical essence of LBT is not defined anywhere in the Russian LAs.  And, in fact, no one uses it. <br><br>  What does this mean specifically for LoRaWAN networks? <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  First, the possibility of withdrawing from the range of 864-865 MHz to the new range of 866-868 MHz.  The old range is inconvenient for two reasons - and because of the duty cycle of just 0.1%, and because of the downturn in the frequency response of existing base stations by 2-3 dB in its lower half. <br><br>  A typical LoRaWAN base station can serve 8 frequency channels in 200 kHz increments - that is, with the old regulation, 2 channels were obtained in the upper range and 5 channels in the lower, total 7. The new regulation allows you to deploy all 8 channels in the upper and middle ranges, and the need (using a BS with two radio units) - as many as 16 channels.  This does not require changing the current LoRaWAN standard, since the base station can transmit a list of available channels to the device when it is registered to the network. <br><br>  Secondly, at base stations, it is possible to increase the exhaust power on the air to 100 mW in order to reach the end devices in the downlink with greater confidence.  This allows you to organize the downlink RX2 at a higher speed than the uplink, and reduce the load of the ether with a large number of devices that use the downlink channel. <br><br>  Thirdly, in all ranges there was a restriction on the duty cycle.  Now you can‚Äôt put a piece of metal that will poison life by continuously radiating something into the air.  On the other hand, this imposes restrictions on the operation of the base station - now it cannot occupy one channel more than 10% of the time. <br><br>  However, restrictions on the base station can be bypassed by the network settings - in the downlink, the base station can respond to the device either at the same frequency on which the latter went on the air, or at a fixed RX2 frequency.  By actively using a combination of them, it is possible to ‚Äúspread‚Äù the airtime of the base station across different frequency channels - given that RX2 can now be made faster due to quadrupled power, this generally solves the problem. <br><br>  Fourthly, in the new range there is a limit on the power spectral density - 1000 mW / MHz.  This means that UNB-systems with their 100-200 Hz bands will not be able to work in it - with an output power of 25 mW and a band of 100 Hz, the spectral density will greatly exceed the allowed one.  Simply put, this range is completely outsourced to broadband systems ‚Äî LoRa and 802.15.4 mesh networks. <br><br>  Fifth, it is tempting to increase the number of standard device registration channels ‚Äî these are the channels on which the BS is obliged to listen to the broadcast, since  when turned on or restarted, the device can exit to any of them.  At the moment there are two such channels, both in the upper range, and one of them coincides with the channel RX2. <br><br>  The new regulation allows you to redraw the channels on the European model - to allocate three full-fledged device registration channels, none of which intersect with the RX2.  Unfortunately, this will require the adoption of a new regional standard (LoRaWAN Regional Parameters) for Russia, which, in turn, will require a flashing of devices and reconfiguration of base stations.  However, there remains the option of adding <i>one</i> new registration channel - then the devices already made under RU864-870 will continue to work properly.  On the third hand, there are not many such devices yet (although so far the new RPs will accept there ...).  With the fourth, the current channels allow you to use devices at airports, without changing their firmware - the base station simply does not have to give them additional channels when registering on the network, that's all. <br><br>  In general, the question is debatable, so I summarize briefly: there will be no changes in the LoRaWAN Regional Parameters for the RU864-870 range. <br><br>  Firmware devices do not need to be changed, you can optionally add new ranges to your network settings today.  They will be distributed automatically to devices (but since the device already registered is already working on the old frequency grid, in practice a new one will be introduced either in addition to the old one to increase the total number of channels or in newly deployed networks). <br><br>  Fourth, we still don‚Äôt have harmonization with Europe, the use of European devices and European settings is still illegal and can lead to the confiscation of equipment.  The European channels - 868.1, 868.3, 868.5 MHz and 869.525 MHz - still do not fall into one of the ranges allowed in Russia. <br><br>  PS If we talk about purely amateur radio devices, then you have every right to do whatever you want for the range of 866-868 MHz, if three conditions are met - a power limit of 25 mW, for a duty cycle of 1% (this is 36 seconds per hour) and using a broadband signal.  If you have devices that broadcast in the range of 868.7-869.2 MHz for more than 360 seconds per hour, now they should be limited. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/425903/">https://habr.com/ru/post/425903/</a></p>
