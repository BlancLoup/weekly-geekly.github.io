Perhaps this is because I have had little respect for calendar holidays.  They <i>depersonalize the</i> event, make it somehow common (that is, nobody's), and the remainder results in only formal congratulations (stamped and bored) and a day off (if, for example, it is February 23 or similar holidays). <br><br>  We, programmers, are often introverts, because such a temper of character allows us to concentrate on an interesting task, hiding in our ‚Äúbubble‚Äù from external stimuli. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  This is cool - there is only you and the <i>world</i> that you are building, which lives according to the rules you set, an infinite field for combinations of solutions: a variety of approaches and patterns, and even your personal imagination.  Everything is in your hands - take it and make it!

      All programmers are familiar with the state of the <a href="http://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%259F%25D0%25BE%25D1%2582%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BA_%2528%25D0%25BF%25D1%2581%25D0%25B8%25D1%2585%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BB%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B3%25D0%25B8%25D1%258F%2529">stream</a> , in which an unexpected idea comes to mind so captured that you can find yourself in an already empty office at one in the morning with three empty mugs of coffee and a wrapper from a sneaker that you don‚Äôt remember when you ate (and didn't even sure who exactly ate it). <br><br>  Programming is not only a special way of thinking, but also a lifestyle, completely different (than in many other professions), the structure of consciousness that provides the nutrient environment and the tools that are so necessary for the birth of good code and beautiful architecture. <br><br>  That is why, despite the <i>calendar</i> day <b>0xFF</b> , I decided to write this post and congratulate all my colleagues!  We are all very different people, but one thing unites us: we are programmers. <br><br>  And on this day (especially Friday), it would be nice to remember that ... <br><br><h5>  Programming evolves </h5><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage3/927/635/cb4/927635cb4ffccd179a82cbbbacc763c1.png" align="right">  Previously, one could be a virtuoso lone programmer and see someone else's code extremely rarely. <br><br>  Now, all the big projects are written and created by teams numbering dozens or even hundreds of people. <br><br>  The result is large and <a href="http://hvylya.org/news/digest/apple-oboshla-exxon-i-stala-samoy-dorogoy-korporatsiey-mira.html">expensive companies</a> . <br><br>  Previously, development was always carried out in the office, but now the number of distributed teams is increasing every year, and state borders are not a hindrance here. <br><br>  And just recently, <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/193280/">standards in this area</a> began to appear in our country, which, I hope, will continue to evolve. <br><br>  Everything testifies to the recognition of the importance of this profession and the entire industry.  We live in an interesting time: the IT sphere is changing the world, like industrialization in its time.  Everything that is possible is automated and algorithmized (although <a href="http://www.computerra.ru/82488/to-o-chem-dogadyivayutsya-vse-aytishniki-no-v-chem-boyatsya-sebe-priznatsya/">not always successfully</a> ), computers are becoming smaller and more accessible, and more and more people use them.  We live during the new scientific and technological revolution, when mars rovers and unmanned vehicles are created, supercomputers calculate the number of pi and take robots into the army, print kidneys on 3D printers and individuals conquer space ... the future, described by numerous science fiction, <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/hub/the_future_is_here/">is here</a> ! <br><br>  And we, programmers, had the opportunity not only to observe and admire, but also to participate in it all! <br><br><h2>  Congratulations to all! </h2><br><br>  <b>PS</b> Well, as a "Friday", to lift the mood: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage3/4a7/b9a/27a/4a7b9a27ae2831392ebcfa4aeaf8ea8e.png" align="right">  <b>Test "You are a programmer, if ..."</b> <br><br>  ... the word "string" means for you a multidimensional array of characters. <br>  ... have you ever dreamed that you are a program running under a debugger. <br>  ... <code>C#</code> you read as "C Sharp", not "Before Sharp" <br>  ... remember your ICQ number, the IP addresses of a couple of cars, the e-wallet number, but enter the birthday calendar of your wife in a calendar with a reminder. <br>  ... understand the joke about debugging. <br>  ... multiple inheritance does not make your wife laugh. <br>  ... Your computer is worth as not much used nine. <br>  ... check the spoon for <code>NULL</code> before sending it to your mouth. <br>  ... understand binary humor. <br>  ... line, vector and map for you related concepts. <br>  ... you know about the most object-oriented way to get rich. <br>  ... trying to immediately close the bracket, even if you write by hand. <br>  ... think that everything that is written after " <code>//</code> " has no consequences. <br><br>  And most importantly: <b>You are a programmer, if true.</b> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/193608/">https://habr.com/ru/post/193608/</a></p>
