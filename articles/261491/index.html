He stepped into the cab <br>  down to the street before his safe house. <br>  Around him, under the overcast sky, and suited <br>  workers filed into the office towers looming above.  Max was going to work too, but his job <br>  good night's sleep after sleep.  He'd be cloistered for days <br>  this time.  Once there is no going home.  No slipping out for a bite <br>  of dinner.  No date night at the multiplex.  Nothing until he was done. <br>  This was the day he was declaring war. <br>  A grid of five grid lines of his <br>  identical bay windows, painted the color of the Golden Gate Bridge.  He'd been coming to <br>  for the exchange students <br>  drawn by short leases and reasonable rents.  Nobody knew his name ‚Äî not his real one anyway. <br>  And nobody knew his past. <br>  Here, he wasn't Max Butler, the small-town troublemaker driven by obsession to a moment <br>  Max Vision, the self-named computer security expert <br>  Silicon Valley companies.  As he <br>  maxed up apartment building, Max became someone else: ‚ÄúIceman‚Äù ‚Äîa rising leader <br>  in the United States of America <br>  consumers. <br>  And Iceman was fed up. <br>  For months, he'd been popping merchants around the country, prying out piles of credit card <br>  numbers that shouldn‚Äôt have been worth it.  But the <br>  market was broken.  Two years earlier Secret Service agents had driven a virtual bulldozer <br>  underworld through the computer largest gathering spot, arresting the ringleaders at <br>  chat forums and web browsing web forums ‚Äî all <br>  riddled with security holes and crawling with feds and snitches.  It was a mess. <br>  If you need them, you need a strong leader to unify them.  To bring <br>  order. <br>  I‚Äôm sitting on the floor for a tail, then I‚Äôve walked to his apartment <br>  door and warmth of the rented studio.  Heat was the biggest problem <br>  with the safe house.  The servers and laptops crammed into the space produced a swelter that <br>  pulsed through the room.  He'd brought in fans over the summer <br>  I like that of the manager suspected him of running a <br>  hydroponic dope farm.  But it was just the machines of the cables. <br>  snake rifle. <br>  Shrugging off his discomfort <br>  where computer criminals gather ‚Äî darkMarket and <br>  TalkCash.  For two days, he hacked his fingers flying at preternatural speed as he breached <br>  defaults, stealing their content, log-ins, passwords, and e-mail addresses.  When he <br>  he returned <br>  bleary-eyed to his work. <br>  He finished out with the keystrokes <br>  arsonist flicking a match.  On August 16, 2006, he dispatched an unapologetic mass e-mail to <br>  He was destroyed: they were all now members of Iceman's own <br>  Cardersmarket.com, six thousand users, the largest criminal marketplace in the world <br>  strong and the only game in town. <br>  Under the law, it was undermined <br>  a billion-dollar criminal underworld. <br>  In the United Kingdom and the United Kingdom <br>  criminals <br>  hostile takeover.  Hen <br>  loot, but they couldn't protect themselves from this.  FBI and Secret Service agents who'd <br>  spent months or years infiltrating the now-destroyed underground forums would read the <br>  for all of them ‚Äî hacking masterminds, thuggish <br>  Russian mobsters, masters of fake identities, <br>  unified by a single thought. <br>  Who is Iceman? <br></div></div><br><br><h5>  Translation Danila (editor Katya) </h5><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/abb/20b/924/abb20b9243b24342d069b7d6c72c3f9a.jpg" alt="image" align="right">  The taxi stood at the doorstep of a small shop in San Francisco's downtown, while Max Vision paid the driver and removed his two-meter-high carcass from the backseat of the car;  his thick dark hair was gathered in a smooth tail behind the back of his head.  He entered the store and waited until the car that had brought him left down the street before he decided to make his way to his refuge, located two blocks from here.  Small shops, news counters and kiosks surrounding him, awakened under the dawn sky;  office plankton crawled into business centers, towering above it.  Max was also going to work, and his work did not leave him the slightest chance to stay at home after nine for a healthy full sleep.  The last few days he spent in complete solitude.  As soon as he realized his plan, he realized that there would be no way home.  There will be no opportunity to run somewhere to eat at lunchtime.  There will be no nightly gatherings at the multiplex. <br>  There will be nothing until he finishes what he has begun. <br>  It was the day of the declaration of war. <br>  A long walk down the street, along which crowded houses with identical window openings and the Golden Gate Bridge color trim, led him to the Post Street Towers.  For several months he came to this apartment complex, doing everything possible not to stand out from the crowd of foreign students attracted here by the opportunity to rent a house for a short time at reasonable prices. <br>  No one knew his name ‚Äî in any case, the real one. <br>  And no one knew his past. <br><br><h5>  Valera's Translation </h5><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/9ca/ea6/0af/9caea60af544f82b5238579859e09c45.jpg" alt="image" align="right">  Here he was not Max Butler, a troublemaker from a small town, obsessed with life-breaking violence, and he was not Max Vizhny, a self-proclaimed computer expert who was paid $ 100 an hour to strengthen the security of the networks of Silicon Valley companies. <br>  Rising in the elevator of a residential building, Max became someone else: ‚ÄúIceman ªom‚Äù - the rising leader of the criminal economy, responsible for the billions of dollars stolen from American companies and their clients. <br>  And the iceman was fed up. <br>  For months, he "had" vendors across the country, receiving heaps of credit card numbers that could cost hundreds of thousands of dollars on the black market. <br>  But the market was destroyed.  Two years ago, secret service agents drove a virtual bulldozer through the main gathering place of the computer underground, arresting the ringleaders at gunpoint, and sending the rest to hustle in chat rooms and small web forums riddled with security holes and teeming with agents of special services and informers. <br>  It was utter chaos. <br>  Whether they knew it or not, the underground needed a strong leader to unite everyone.  To restore order. <br><br><h5>  Alena's translation </h5><br>  Stepping out of the elevator and sneaking a peek into the corridor to see if there was anyone on the tail, Max went into his apartment and merged with the oppressive stuffiness of the rented studio.  Heat was the biggest problem of this place.  It came in a sultry wave from servers and laptops wedged into any free space.  One summer, Max brought several fans there, but they did not help much and so inflated electric bills that the landlord began to suspect him of growing weed.  However, these were just cars, intertwined into one large network with wires, the most significant of which were drawn to a giant parabolic antenna, which was stuck out of the window, like a sniper rifle. <br><br><h5>  Translated by Dima </h5><br>  Disregarding all the inconveniences, Max sat down at the keyboard and began to monitor / fill his hand on the sites / those sites where cybercriminals gathered - virtual sites like Darkmarket or TalkCash.  Two days that he was engaged in hacking, his fingers flew over the keyboard with incredible speed: he hacked into the protection of websites, stole their content, logins, passwords and email addresses. <br>  When he was tired, he fell into a folding bed in his room for an hour or two, and then returned to work with a clouded look. <br>  A few final blows to the buttons of the keyboard, made with the ease with which the fakir lights the match, destroyed the site databases.  On August 16, 2006, he leaked an unprecedented number of email addresses to users of websites that he hacked: now they were all participants of Cardersmarket.com, owned by Iceman and suddenly becoming the biggest criminal market in the world, with 6,000 users and kind of <br><br><h5>  Translation of Oli and Dashi (editor Katya) </h5><br>  One shot Max killed two birds with one stone: undermined the years of hard work of law enforcement and resurrected the criminal underground, in whose hands were concentrated billions of dollars. <br><br>  In all of Russia, Ukraine, Turkey and the UK;  in every home, in every office, in every apartment in America, the criminals were stunned by the news of this first hostile takeover that took place in the underground world.  Some of them had weapons in their cabinets to protect their looted millions, but they could not do it.  The FBI and US Secret Service agents who spent months or even years penetrating into now collapsing underground forums read with equal horror the message, and for a minute they all: hack virtuosos, Russian mafia thugs, masters of fake IDs and police officers who vowed to catch them - were united by one thought. <br>  Who is Iceman? <br><br><h4>  Resources </h4><br>  <a href="http://lenta.ru/articles/2010/02/16/butler/">Article</a> on the tape in Russian (02/16/2010) <br><br>  <a href="http://www.wired.com/2011/05/carders/">CHAT LOG: WHAT IT LOOKS LIKE WHEN HACKERS SELL YOUR CREDIT CARD ONLINE</a> (WIRED, by Kevin Poulsen 05/04/11) <br><br>  <a href="http://www.wired.com/2009/06/butler_court/">Superhacker Max Butler Pleads Guilty</a> (WIRED, by Kevin Poulsen 06.29.09) <br><br>  <a href="http://archive.wired.com/techbiz/people/magazine/17-01/ff_max_butler%3FcurrentPage%3Dall">One Hacker's</a> Audited <a href="http://archive.wired.com/techbiz/people/magazine/17-01/ff_max_butler%3FcurrentPage%3Dall">Credit Cards on the Black Market</a> (WIRED, by Kevin Poulsen, 12.22.08) <br><br>  video <a href="http://www.cnbc.com/id/100000049">Cybercrime: Max Butler</a> <br><br>  Kevin Poulsen about the hacker on the Dark Side: <br><br><iframe width="420" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/m9JCh8orYzg%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700022,15700186,15700191,15700248,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhhrktH4OYChi7licNju9Oomm6S8dw" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/261491/">https://habr.com/ru/post/261491/</a></p>
