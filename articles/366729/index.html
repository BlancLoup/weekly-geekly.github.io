They became relevant again when they returned to fashion on simple digital dials of electronic watches, however, the manufacturer has been known for more than 20 years in the market of consumer mobile electronics for health, as well as contracts for the American army and NASA. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/828/865/e25/828865e2531143f1a12e11c7a333e2bf.JPG"><br><br>  Everything in order inside. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Smart Health is owned by the Salutron brand, along with the Lifetrak brand, and produces an electronic watch with additional features:

People who may be cool about technical innovations or due to age / wealth / low interest do not have smartphones with which up to 90% of gadgets are synchronized now.  Here it should be briefly clarified that the ‚ÄúSmart Health‚Äù is intended for pulse measurement ‚Äúon demand‚Äù, and this function can also be used by the older generation. </li><li>  <b>The rich</b> .  Despite the modest price, such a tracker is exactly what they need to go to the gym!  Since Smart Health does not assume any statistics other than daily, it‚Äôs not necessary to sacrifice Patek Philippe, Vacheron Constantin or Cartier for the sake of it. </li><li>  <b>Parents of schoolchildren</b> .  Simple and clear first of all hours, which are not ashamed, and not afraid to trust in a modern school.  Plus additional features that can be used as desired. </li><li>  <b>We are with you</b> .  ‚ÄúArchaic‚Äù dial from the 80s - 90s in a minimalist style, with a simple rubber strap: geek-watches for all times! </li></ul><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/828/865/e25/828865e2531143f1a12e11c7a333e2bf.JPG"><br><br>  <b>Key Smart Health Features</b> <br><br>  The watches are known on the market as accurate heart rate monitors, and for a long time Salutron did not enter the market of sports consumer electronics at all, working with government agencies and large medical enterprises. <br><br>  The technologies developed by the company turned out to be attractive both for the American army, and <a href="http://geektimes.ru/company/medgadgets/blog/263554/">for NASA</a> , and for the creators of professional sports and medical equipment.  In this regard, the niche of consumer smart devices was divided before Salutron launched its marketing campaign. <br><br>  So in the first place: <br><br><ul><li>  Pulse measurement </li><li>  Clock (format 12) </li><li>  Steps </li><li>  Calories </li><li>  Distance </li><li>  Backlight in the dark </li><li>  Replaceable battery </li><li>  Does not sync with phone </li><li>  Waterproof (you can‚Äôt push buttons in the water) </li></ul><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/9c3/9db/77f/9c39db77f2f946e588dfe0d7b4421b1a.JPG"><br><br>  <b>How pulse measurement works</b> <br><br>  To make a measurement, you need to keep the watch on your hand, and with the second hand press the central (largest) button.  It is important that the hands do not touch each other. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/m9SXMpQ3mbg%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700023,15700186,15700190,15700248,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhhrQ1E_bz_ZYRLsVeasvyiilmnt0A" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  <b>Tracker control:</b> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/209/a0a/dc8/209a0adc84c34ea78ada83fbc19b497a.JPG"><br><br>  Since the device is completely autonomous, you can only control it with buttons.  There are five of them: <br><br><ul><li>  The central is responsible for the pulse and is not involved in any settings. </li><li>  Light - activates the backlight </li><li>  View - shows daily statistics </li><li>  Reset - reset the device </li><li>  Time - brings up the settings menu </li></ul><br><br>  <b>Settings menu:</b> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/d6b/db9/0cc/d6bdb90cc2d14b5a887cebd0bfcc75f6.jpg"><br><br><ul><li>  1 long press to ‚Äúpikaniya‚Äù opens the opportunity to change the time and select the unit of measurement: km / mile.

This is done using all the same buttons.  After turning on the device, it will show 12.00, and the "view" button - indicates the morning hours, the "reset" button - evening, or after noon: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/a36/9ac/9ab/a369ac9ab6d34ab189145a147b5ab36b.jpg"><br><br>  When the blowjob is noon, the letter ‚ÄúP‚Äù will appear in the upper left corner. <br><br>  Long hold the "view" button shows the statistics for the previous day. <br><br>  <b>Appearance</b> <br><br>  The device is sold in a little "grotesque" box, deliberately highlighted, the shape of which is unusual for us.  Inside there are documents in foreign languages: instructions and guide for a quick start.  The box itself is informative and gives an idea of ‚Äã‚Äãthe device in front of us. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/78b/0d8/116/78b0d81168b544c4975e1b7ae9cf557c.jpg"><br><br>  The clock is usual round and the time is constantly displayed on the main screen. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/b28/c13/f4f/b28c13f4f36d4a70b0e8db4b0b83c83d.JPG"><br><br>  The device is available in two colors: black and white. <br>  The cost of hours with a Smart Health heart rate monitor is <a href="http://medgadgets.ru/shop/sportivnye-chasy-smart-health-walking-fit.html%3Futm_source%3Dgktms%26utm_medium%3Dobzor%26utm_content%3Dsmart%26utm_campaign%3Dhealth">3 390 rubles *</a> . <br><br>  <b>Pros.</b>  <b>Minuses.</b>  <b>Results</b> <br><br>  Smart Health is a watch with a heart rate monitor, and therefore all side functions, such as a pedometer, calorie counter, should not be taken very seriously, especially since the statistics are reset every day. <br><br>  It is more logical to consider these values ‚Äã‚Äãas conditional ‚Äúmotivating‚Äù to movement, activity factors, but you need to be prepared, as here, as in most, 99% of modern activity trackers, you will notice an error in the calculation.  More precisely, not only the steps will be taken into account in the activity, but also the waving / lifting of the arm, from which the number of displayed steps will grow.  Calories gadget takes into account not only actively burned, but also those that you spend at rest. <br><br>  <b>Pros:</b> <br><br><ul><li>  Heart rate monitor </li><li>  Long working time, independent of charging </li><li>  Water resistant </li><li>  Simple operation </li></ul><br><br>  <b>Minuses:</b> <br><br><ul><li>  The absence of the application and the inability to maintain long-term statistics.  Although, again, it depends on how you treat this, because Smart Health is not a tracker. </li></ul><br><br>  <b>The similar</b> <br><br>  The closest to Smart Health is the product of the same Salutron, Lifetrak C200, where also: <br><br><ul><li>  Episodic pulse measurements </li><li>  Counting steps, calories, distance </li><li>  Clock </li><li>  Water resistant </li><li>  Battery life up to 1 year from a replaceable battery </li></ul><br><br>  Plus, the activity statistics can be saved for a 7-day period and interchangeable straps.  The device also works without an application.  The cost of <a href="http://medgadgets.ru/shop/treker-aktivnosti-the-core-c200.html%3Futm_source%3Dgktms%26utm_medium%3Dobzor%26utm_content%3Dlifetrak%26utm_campaign%3Dc200">Lifetrak C200 is 4,450 rubles</a> . <br><br>  The next model is Lifetrak 410, where the ability to analyze sleep and synchronize with IOS and Android devices is already implemented.  The cost of such a device is <a href="http://medgadgets.ru/shop/treker-aktivnosti-lifetrak-zonec410.html%3Futm_source%3Dgktms%26utm_medium%3Dobzor%26utm_content%3Dlifetrak%26utm_campaign%3D410">5,999 rubles</a> . <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/49e/c8f/5aa/49ec8f5aaa044d4598fdb79ab9e2bb10.jpg"><br><br>  * Traditionally, we remind you about the Geek code, which makes it possible to buy from us on the site with a 7% discount. <br>  Thanks for attention. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/366729/">https://habr.com/ru/post/366729/</a></p>
