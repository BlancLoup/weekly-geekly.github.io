  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Social behavior statistics on news sites: how can it help with traffic and monetization issues?</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Today, when many media outlets are completely switching over to electronic versions, and the audience is devoting more and more time to their friend tapes, integration with social networks and a continuous increase in citation are very important for a news site.  Social and behavioral metrics of users acquire an enormous role, about which you need to know as much as possible in order to analyze and stimulate social activity.  According to Awareness, Inc., about 96% of companies measure the number of fans and followers, 89% - traffic from social networks, 55% - mention of the brand on the Internet, 55% - balls and 51% - the tone of statements. <br><br>  <a href="http://www.themediabriefing.com/article/social-sharing-statistics-50-news-comment-articles-national-newspapers-facebook-twitter">The Media Briefing</a> did a little research to find out which news media is best integrated with social networks and get the most tweets and balls.  6 popular titles were reviewed and the number of balloons and tweets of 50 publications of each of them was calculated.  The results were as follows: Daily Mail - 6,526 balls and 1,545 tweets, Independent - 5,923 and 4,331, Telegraph - 3,372 and 2,419, Guardian - 2,866 and 2,818, Sun - 536 and 345, Times - 131 and 294 The latest edition takes care of maintaining the format known for decades.  The rest are actively working to increase the social activity of readers, because the proportion of traffic from social networks is increasing every day. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  To stimulate and analyze the social behavior of users on the sites, at the end of 2013, a special multifunctional module <a href="http://uptolike.ru/">UpToLike</a> (developed by SeoPult) was launched.  Now this system is not yet working at full capacity and not all functions are implemented, but there are some very utilitarian things and "chips" that are worth mentioning.  These are subtle statistics of social behavior and complete customization of social buttons. <br><br>  For example, the monthly statistics of Site 1 look like: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/792/dd7/e72/792dd7e72dad041260383111b19216d6.png" alt="image">

        </script>
      <br>
      The screen shot shows that in a month all the pages of the site collect more than 2,500 likes and balls, while more than 1,100 new users come to the site from social networks. <br><br>  In the Detailed statistics tab you can see the following charts: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/612/cdc/9b0/612cdc9b0a1ea2753a3550b638f93bac.png" alt="image"><br><br>  The page layout of the site and the layout from social networks are given: you can clearly see which pages give the most likes, balls and tweets, which pages the users return to, where new users come from, which social networks. <br><br>  The buttons on the site themselves look like this (and this is a very good example of the correct location: the first screen, vertically to the left): <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/e1d/283/703/e1d283703425208ab90e3856564e7cbf.png" alt="image"><br><br>  Here is another example of the location of the buttons: under the player showing the movie on Site 2 (perhaps not the most successful placement option and below we will see the social statistics of this site): <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/2ba/dbd/485/2badbd48571eb11523f4416fc7f8ab59.png" alt="image"><br><br>  Site 2 statistics look like this: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/b47/959/2de/b479592de97abc2190d94f7e6f79f384.png" alt="image"><br><br>  Compared with the huge number of likes and balls for the month, the number of attracted users from social networks is not significant. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/975/4c4/01e/9754c401ec8b47a9c23020b36b048016.png" alt="image"><br><br>  One of the possible reasons for this picture is that almost half of the social traffic comes from Vkontakte ÔÅä <br><br>  <b>A few words about customization.</b>  The UpToLike buttons can be located anywhere on the page, executed in different colors, sizes, styles, forms, 29 social networks can be involved here, as well as the functions ‚ÄúPrint to print‚Äù, ‚ÄúAdd to favorites‚Äù, etc. In the coming days they will be added functions of rotation and zoom buttons when hovering, as well as the variability of the text for sharing ‚ÄúShare‚Äù (you can insert your own text instead of ‚ÄúShare‚Äù, how much fantasy is enough). <br><br>  All the listed things are first of all: <br><br>  a) field for experiments with conversion; <br>  b) a simple way to ‚Äúrefresh‚Äù the site. <br><br>  <b>What exactly will help statistics of social behavior of users of news sites?</b> <br><br>  <b>Growth of traffic from social networks</b> <br>  According to a Reuters Institute study, the news site receives an average of 7.5% of referral traffic from Facebook.  At the same time, in general, traffic from social networks, according to various estimates, can be up to 30%, and first of all due to sharing.  Statistics of social activity on the site will help to understand which pages have the greatest social potential and that will allow increasing the citation. <br><br>  <b>Organic traffic growth</b> <br>  What is fundamentally important in the first place for news portals, which are just beginning to win their share of readers.  Both Yandex and Google pay increased attention to social factors when ranking resources.  At the same time, the number of likes, balls, friends on social networks, non-search traffic, how much time people spend on the site, etc. is important. Many people believe that in the future social signals may even crowd out links that have long been considered the main factor in ranking.  Today, sites integrated with Google+ are ranked higher in the SERP than other resources. <br><br>  <b>Monetization</b> <br>  Another advantage follows from the previous point.  Since social and behavioral factors are gaining more and more weight when ranking sites, they are also important when building a reference mass.  Sites integrated with social systems and receiving a consistently large number of likes and shores will take priority from companies that are looking for donor resources for posting links or articles. <br><br>  <b>Hanging content quality and relevance</b> <br>  Knowledge of social and behavioral metrics will make the content as relevant as possible to the audience.  Comparing the statistics of likes, balls, the number and quality of comments, the traffic received by the pages, you can understand which sections, topics, content formats, headings work best.  And then adjust the content, increasing the number of shores and satisfied readers.  For example, you can easily check whether the reader really so powerfully clings to headlines like ‚Äú7 ways to change life for the better‚Äù, ‚Äú33 tips for hamster owners‚Äù, etc. <br><br>  <b>Increase the conversion of individual elements of the page</b> <br>  The title, the length of the text, the presence of an illustration, the formatting of the text - all these details affect not only whether the material is read, but also what is the probability that he will get a like or a ball.  According to The Media Briefing, in the Guardian, texts with a length of more than 800 words receive an average of more than 100 tweets, while texts with a length of up to 500 words - no more than 10. Interestingly, the length of articles in the Telegraph, Daily Mail, The Times does not affect number of tweets. <br><br>  <b>The optimal location of social buttons on the site</b> <br>  The appearance of social buttons and their location affects the number of likes and shores they can get.  Of course, each site is individual, and what works on one resource may not work on another.  This is where social activity statistics will help.  Many say, for example, that the dynamic panel on the left side receives much more likes and sherov than other variations.  In the case of Quick Sprout - 226% more.  Also on the news portals usually work well medium size in the field of view and easily distinguishable buttons on the page (which will not always be effective for an online store). <br><br>  <b>In increasing the number of regular readers</b> <br>  According to statistics, the person who put the likes or the ball is likely to return to the site.  And the more balls from one person, the greater the likelihood that he signs up for updates and will regularly look at the site. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/213041/">https://habr.com/ru/post/213041/</a></p>
