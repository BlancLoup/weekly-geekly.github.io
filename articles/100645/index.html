  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Vicious element #Vkontakte</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  A few months ago, the Vkontakte website opened for public dialogue with users, thanks in large part to Vladislav Tsyplukhin ( <a href="http://geektimes.ru/users/invladis/" class="user_link">invladis</a> ) and to the website habrahabr.ru/.  Habr is an interesting platform and authoritative in its own way.  The opinion here is listened to.  That's why Vkontakte is trying to be open.  Seem more precisely.  In fact, everything is different. <br><br>  But now is not about that. <a name="habracut"></a>  Now - about people who spoil this image.  They hide their decisions, hide their actions, persecute those who disagree with the eternal ban - this is such a fun, you know.  The main thing is to write a fabricated reason. <br>  Distribution of the so-called disclaimers (plates about incorrect information on the user‚Äôs page) wholesale and retail, assigning the votes ‚Äúfor nothing‚Äù written off to his beloved.  Moreover, it is not the moderators who are busy with this (as a rule, who recently bought the post for ‚Äú30 pieces of silver‚Äù of Judah and therefore cowardly by definition), but administrators who have not achieved anything outstanding in the internal hierarchy of the site. <br>  In confirmation of this, Viktor Strelchuk wrote in his blog (http://strelchook.livejournal.com/5876.html) a very entertaining post.  The most informative in another - I checked the facts given by him through a familiar administrator and - oh, a miracle!  - all confirmed.  Screens, for obvious reasons, will not be posted to the public - no one wants to stay without work. <br><br>  Yesterday I read the article ‚ÄúThere is no limit to lawlessness‚Äù ( <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/social_networks/100446/">habrahabr.ru/blogs/social_networks/100446</a> ) and many interesting things have come to mind.  For example‚Ä¶ <br>  In the summer of 2009, we (like-minded people at that time) accidentally discovered a bug in the API 2.0 system ‚Äî it just ‚Äúsurfaced‚Äù by itself.  The guys wanted to play pranks: spend a part on gifts and a rating (well, it's like 25% of the found treasure is due - they decided).  And I - it so happened - and the voices and rating and gifts were.  I was not afraid of them.  I decided to tell Alexey Bogatov about the bug - and he was ‚Äúin the tank‚Äù - the person was closed.  A companion moderator reported.  that through their channels conveyed bugreport to Alexei.  I went to bed. <br>  Morning: the voices are not written off, everyone doesn‚Äôt care about the bug, the reaction from Alexey is zero.  ‚ÄúYour case‚Äù - I thought, and transferred the voices to the id of those who helped to get to the administration.  It seems - everything - the curtain.  The time has passed, I became the official developer of VK applications, I got the rights of a moderator.  A couple of days later, Alexey Bogatov took away the rights and declared something strange: "You are a thief, there is no place for thieves."  In essence, it is a judicial statement, and it‚Äôs also amoral.  The reaction to my constructive answer is to blacklist me wherever possible.

      Imagine, still trying to defend their honest name - and in any way.  "The most open company in the world" traditionally "stood in a pose" offended administrator, offended by the <a href="http://geektimes.ru/users/aobogatov/" class="user_link">average</a> user <a href="http://geektimes.ru/users/aobogatov/" class="user_link">aobogatov</a> Alexei Bogatov <br>  <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/vkontakte/blog/100510/">habrahabr.ru/company/vkontakte/blog/100510/#comment_3112718</a> <br><br>  Comical and funny, about offended by only one user, the largest social network in Russia. <br><br>  After that: this is not a stupid whining, just a call to act, to get rid of the closed segments of the site and even the whole system of ‚Äúmutual responsibility‚Äù and protection of one‚Äôs own, for 3 years well-established. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/100645/">https://habr.com/ru/post/100645/</a></p>
