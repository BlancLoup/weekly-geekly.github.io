I read a lot of books ... everything that I write out is lost. ‚Äù  Together with <a href="http://eugene.getmanenko.ru/">Yevgeny Getmanenko,</a> we implemented the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãa site with wise words, which is what I want to briefly say. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  The site is small in structure.  You can reach any page in no more than 3 clicks.

     <a href="http://greatwords.ru/"><img src="http://old.s-a-p.in/images/greatwords/all.png" alt="The site is small in its structure ..."></a> <br><br>  After the first layouts, it became clear that we needed a couple of clouds and a search to find something to read.  The dimensions of the cloud element nonlinearly depend on the number of quotes attached to it, which allows the "giants" to grow with deceleration.  And they say mathematics in the eleventh grade is needed only for admission to universities :-). <br><br> <a href="http://greatwords.ru/"><img src="http://old.s-a-p.in/images/greatwords/cloud.png" alt="The dimensions of a cloud element nonlinearly depend on the number of quotes attached to it ..."></a> <br><br>  At first we did not expect that the site would be fully implemented without a single page reload, using Ajax.  But over time, they decided to do this by duplicating the support of most pages in case of JavaScript turned off (Eugene wanted to be able to record quotes from a mobile phone) and for search engines.  The adoption of the player pushed us to this - the most successful concept here for making the transition between quotations.  Following this concept, the list of quotes by author or by tag looks like a playlist.  You can choose any quote from the list and read it, as well as use the buttons ‚ÄúPrevious quote‚Äù and ‚ÄúNext quote‚Äù.  But most importantly - the ability to play.  By adjusting the speed of reading for yourself and pressing the play button, you can sit back and enjoy great words - the quotes will change automatically with the speed you set.  And this is just an option;  when it is not needed, it does not hurt the eyes. <br><br> <a href="http://greatwords.ru/"><img src="http://old.s-a-p.in/images/greatwords/playlist.png" alt="And this is just an option, which, when not needed, does not hurt the eyes ..."></a> <br><br>  Somehow I thought: if during the work of a regular desktop application, after each action the form would start to flash and reboot, how would it be perceived :-)?  Modern web applications should not yield to the application software.  When you load the next page, the previous one does not disappear anywhere or blink.  An animated download icon appears on the bottom right, the mouse cursor changes to an hourglass.  I believe that the sites of the future will be like that. <br><br> <a href="http://greatwords.ru/"><img src="http://old.s-a-p.in/images/greatwords/loading.png" alt="When you load the next page, the previous one does not disappear anywhere ..."></a> <br><br>  Registered users have their own advantages: firstly, they maintain speed.  Secondly, they can maintain a list of selected quotes.  Thirdly, everything that they add is also available as a separate playlist.  For the guests, these functions, for understandable reasons, are not available.  The rest of their capabilities are the same. <br><br>  Search we can improve when we move to your hosting.  Now, we don‚Äôt have access to what is needed for this, and a dedicated server is not available for financial reasons.  Search engines do not get confused on our site, we have made efforts for this, so you can search with their help. <br><br>  Any visitor can add a quote.  We check and edit all added quotes, arrange synonyms with existing labels and authors.  Synonymy is necessary to avoid duplicates and similar words - for example, we always make different numerical forms of the word synonyms.  For a label, quotes with synonyms given are also displayed.  The same is with the authors, since different spellings of the name of one person are possible.  We reserve the right to reject a quote if it is boring, is already on the site or if the author is not specified (even in a broad sense, such as, for example, ‚ÄúAncient Egyptians‚Äù). <br><br>  A little about the technical side: when writing the backend, not a single php framework was used (yes, the site was made in php), the code was completely written from scratch.  When writing the frontend, the js frameworks were also not used, all js was written by hand, but the JsHttpRequest library was used.  Minimized XHTML standards website.  By the way, there is one technical limitation: we do not guarantee the correct operation of the site in Internet Explorer 6. The reason is simple - it absolutely does not support modern technologies. <br><br>  <b>Additions</b> <br><br>  1. According to the wishes of many users, a version with a white background and black font will appear, as an alternative to the existing one. <br>  2. After a short habraeffekt, the site works again. <br>  3. Thank you all for the high ratings of the topic, thanks to them I can now give an invite to <a href="http://egetmanenko.habrahabr.ru/">Evgeny Getmanenko</a> , with whom we did this project. <br>  4. Also thanks for the comments here and for the letters with comments and suggestions. <br>  5. Well, thanks for your activity.  Physically, I do not have time to approve all the quotes :) But you can be sure that if the quote is adequate, it will definitely appear on the site. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/51425/">https://habr.com/ru/post/51425/</a></p>
