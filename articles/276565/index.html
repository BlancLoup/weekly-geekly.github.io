Like ‚Äúyour region is no longer supported, you will receive a dollar penalty for a serial number and a signature on the e-mail in our office in Riga‚Äù ... Well, the tab was not in a fresh update, but also in the New Year one - it was not so severely tested. <br>  I figured - the number of accounting, banks and cash offices - and realized that the abolition of the commodity-money in one single can happen "sa-a-a-vsem ne as" as the classics dreamed ... <br>  - Not-ee, already managed to - Linux deploy.  Though ~ somehow ~ somewhere.  This is a reflective threat. <br>  Better look: the power contactor of a solid company.

For an electrician, this is an atomic thing - simple and reliable. <br>  Arranged, think elementary?  - from the small button the coil of the solenoid pulls the anchor - closes the contacts with large currents and voltages: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/73d/bfe/8ed/73dbfe8ede034e11a0395120db982d31"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  Well, not a computer, but something like: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/61f/ed7/cb8/61fed7cb80fa464b8836d2aa90da0cb2"><br>  In addition to the coil itself and the contacts, there is a board, there are a lot of parts on the board, including ELEVEN transistors with rezukami (hi-fi amp, not otherwise), a small coil, a power MOSFET, an optocoupler and a 10-pin chip ... <br>  For comparison, about the same angle of domestic products: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/915/472/460/9154724604cc4227b2a83ff665bb7121.jpg" alt="Iek"><br><br>  The documentation says that it is a snubber chain - they say, it straightens and smoothes the power, removes pulsations, protects from interference in both directions (the coil from the network noise and the control circuit from emissions when the coil opens ...) <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/798/323/e3c/798323e3cf12421b87c6bb43b8f5d8d1.jpg">

      The specialist in me says that this seems to be true, and the board itself looks like a step-down power supply - for example, up to 12 volts and then all the coils are the same ... <br>  But the paranoid in me asks - and why the heck then this board has a connection with all the closable contacts?  (those silver ‚Äúcranberries‚Äù in the general picture are inserted into the shiny ‚Äúforks‚Äù on the board.) And not only with its supply-including chain? <br><br>  The specialist claims that this is probably the protection of current and overvoltage. <br>  But the paranoid says that it is a backup feeder coil and board, but that cube is an ionistor on board. <br><br>  And the coil of the solenoid, which is traction - it is powered from the starting circuit through transistors or triacs - and in the off state it is a mid-wave antenna. <br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">board in large pieces - 5 fot 1920</b> <div class="spoiler_text"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/fa8/370/a68/fa8370a684fe4f91b5333f2420793b05.jpg"><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/6d8/95f/c9c/6d895fc9c51244b1b080342572cb8d88.jpg"><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/f1e/f22/193/f1ef221938ae477bb51d9e4ad7bb22f9.jpg"><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/2b9/0d3/eb6/2b90d3eb6d0445f883db9d4d6de94c48.jpg"><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/cf0/a84/6ac/cf0a846ac64f4e7fb79328a8631e0011.jpg"><br></div></div><br><br>  The specialist, of course, pokes the skeptic‚Äôs nose into the datasheet of that mikruha, to which the paranoid will answer, that if there really is a bookmark, then the mortgagee isn‚Äôt an idiot honestly marking it and marking it for sure.  And what program is spinning on that mikruh - and the company is big and can afford not just a simple penny, but a custom mikruha - you need to do a lot of complicated research.  And, by the way, not the fact that on all batches of these actuators the mikruha is the same and even if it is the same - that it has the same firmware.  Although it seems to be, it is still not a Wi-Fi or Bluetooth module. <br><br>  And if once on an external signal all the actuators of this company pass into a mode, say, cyclic on / off-on / off with a period of, say, 3.14 seconds - estimate what will happen to consumers?  How long will the data center on this power?  And at the same time, it will be a signal to all the same switches in the chain - ‚Äúrepeat‚Äù.  And the coil, probably, catches the same frequency.  Although it is more logical, of course, to catch <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/post/102614/">this frequency</a> .  The market of this company - the more responsible the object - the more, yes, even if it‚Äôs just 5% evenly throughout the system ... Here we will already have the abolition of the electrification of the whole country.  The subtle humor of the situation that this contactor for the consumer / user is not collapsible is an atomic standard product, his own behavior is not assumed in principle. <br>  The specialist, of course, will say that then, in general, all power supplies in the country are on imported chips. <br>  The paranoiac in response giggles meaningfully: ‚Äújust about‚Äù ... <br><br>  We stood and lazily smoked on the porch discussing that ‚Äúyes-ah ... without Windows, at first it will be hard, but not fatal, but in winter electricity - drop everything, go repair‚Äù ... Our electrician stood nearby, listened-listened and showed at passing by awning "gazelle" with shabby inscription ~ "MosOblEnergoStoTot": <br>  ‚ÄúTwo Tajiks in this type of machine will go around Moscow in a month for‚Äú betonka ‚Äùand mine all the major power lines ‚Äî wrapped up with a thick mat with termite ‚Äî not a single dog ... With a timer on, say,‚Äú 18 zero-February 23rd. ‚Äù  Even paint and hang the tag.  And this thing will be enough for the intellectuals and incomes of these very jihad-electricians at that ghazal.  And no you world behind the scenes, external financing and the risk of precious, in half a century, reputation. <br>  ‚ÄúSo, guys, many knowledge is, of course, many sorrows, but paranoia is a disease.‚Äù  And it must be treated. <br><hr><br>  And in the ‚Äúpuzzles‚Äù I stuck this post - to offer some fun at my leisure - WHAT can I put into this / such a board, what other clever functionality besides the main one? </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/276565/">https://habr.com/ru/post/276565/</a></p>
