  <section class="page js-page"><h1>AMD and Hyper-Threading</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Many people remember the Hyper-Threading technology as the technology created by INTEL.  Although I did not find the history of the creation of the technology itself, a small hint was found leading to another, smaller company.  And here I decided to figure it out. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/6b1/085/dbd/6b1085dbd81e243ac54a68a7a263897c.png"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h4>  Introduction </h4><br>  As we remember, Hyper-threading technology (hereinafter referred to as HT) belongs to Intel, and is used in a wide range of processors, let's say it was used in Pentium 4 processors, Core i3 / i5 / i7, as well as in a line of server processors.  Wikipedia speaks about this technology "the technology developed by Intel for processors on the micro-architecture of NetBurst", and the English Wikipedia is sent to Intel, speaking vaguely. <br><br>  As many will remember, HT is a ‚Äúsoftware package‚Äù (information taken from the forum in the 201st, unfortunately the link has been lost).  Although it is implemented in hardware, almost nothing is known about the history of this technology.  And here it is worth finding out.

    <h4>  Start search </h4><br>  So, thanks to <a href="http://www.google.ru/patents/">the Google service</a> , I can search for patents without straining.  And we enter HT first, the result is surprising, namely: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/a43/39a/cf1/a4339acf192b01915e32215dde49c8f8.png" title="Interesting"><br><br>  No direct description of HT technology.  Only approximate patents did not find what you need.  Although you should pay attention to the <a href="https://www.google.ru/patents/US20060080660%3Fdq%3DHyper-threading%26hl%3Dru%26sa%3DX%26ved%3D0CC8Q6AEwAmoVChMInq6y4Z6MyAIVSdksCh1kjwr3">patent number 2</a> , describing the disconnection of technology HT, without hints on its implementation at the level of iron.  But this article is not dedicated to this particular patent, so I will go further. <br><br><h4>  Search for information </h4><br>  And it is logical to turn to the history of the creation of HT, but this is also a fiasco, everything leads to Intel, no guesses.  Finally, I entered the hyper threading patent in Google and issued several articles: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/3ea/10f/cbc/3ea10fcbcd0285137f64956f8d5bf899.png"><br><br>  Of these results, I was interested in the <a href="http://www.techspot.com/news/3556-amd-patent-could-enable-hyperthreading.html">third</a> .  I decided to do his freestyle translation: <br><br>  <em>‚ÄúBack in 1999, AMD filed a patent application, which gives them the right to release a processor with Hyper-Threading technology.</em>  <em>The name of the technology had a different name, but it gives a complete understanding of the technology: "Microprocessor configured to execute multiple threads including interrupt service routines" (Processor configuration for running multiple threads, including an interrupt).</em>  <em>The patent, as it is easy to guess, describes how a processor can execute several threads simultaneously.</em> <em><br><br></em>  <em>As part of this patent, we could see Hyper-Threading technology in Athlon processors, expected in 2003.</em>  <em>Otherwise, AMD may not be able to compete with INTEL. ‚Äù</em> <br><br>  I was interested in this news.  Namely, the technology indicated in this article. <br><br><h4>  Cover rupture </h4><br>  Returning to Google's patents, I decided to hammer in this technology, and I was given a very interesting result: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/571/e63/f62/571e63f6211c8c87fb16f37f5a58610e.png"><br><br>  When you click on the <a href="https://www.google.ru/patents/US5944816%3Fdq%3DMicroprocessor%2Bconfigured%2Bto%2Bexecute%2Bmultiple%2Bthreads%2Bincluding%2Binterrupt%2Bservice%2Broutines%26hl%3Dru%26sa%3DX%26ved%3D0CBoQ6AEwAGoVChMIvZH5vJaMyAIVhYosCh3aNgYM">first result</a> , as stated in the news, we get the date of the patent by AMD in 1999, and the technology was announced in 1996. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/ca6/153/f49/ca6153f49d96bd77c40fc64778f911b0.png"><br><br>  Now let's go through the patent purchase history: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/90c/881/f69/90c881f69571badb8f6a97753f86acc8.png"><br><br>  I was interested in licensing a patent in 2002 by an ‚ÄúAnonymous‚Äù player in the market, a little podguliv, anyone can find out information about what technology the Pentium 4 processor came out with in that month. And he liked it so much that he decided to extend the patent for another 8 years and then at 12. I think the conclusions are less obvious. <br><br><h4>  findings </h4><br>  I can‚Äôt say anything for sure, because my knowledge of English does not allow me to translate this life-long patent.  But this article made me think about some aspects of HT, let's say that the ‚Äúoriginal‚Äù implementation of this technology lies with the red giant, but the next one, which has the name ‚ÄúHyper-threading‚Äù, already lies with another well-known company. <br><br>  The author of this article will not say anything, but he hopes for hints from readers.  And I hope you were interested to read my thoughts on this topic, not to mention the new information for yourself. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/267853/">https://habr.com/ru/post/267853/</a></p>
