      Here, for example, in the month of March, <a href="http://cakelabs.ru/">we</a> began to cooperate with the hosting provider Clodo.ru, which was not the cheapest, but promised to just go crazy about how reliable it was.  "Cloud hosting", and the truth, at first quite pleased myself.  To celebrate, we moved there and your site, and many sites of our clients.  And tuned to the smooth operation.  But no. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  It began like a small.  We look somehow - and our site lies.  Unpleasant <br><br>  We look further - and the sites of our friends, lovingly created and hosted by us, also lie.  It became quite unpleasant for us. <br><br>  We are generally not scandalous and tend to treat many things with understanding: all the people, and the employees of the company providing the hosting, too.  You never know what happened to them: something closed, and a fifteen-minute opacification occurred on our resources;  nothing corrected now, they are reliable. <br><br>  We waited a bit - turbidity does not pass and does not pass.  It seems like Claude was promised <b>no more than ten hours of downtime per year</b> .  After lunch, it became clear that the guys decided to spend all ten hours during the current day. <br><br>  As it turned out further, Claudo <b>got into the credit of the</b> permissible ‚Äúdead‚Äù time for several years ahead: our and other websites supervised by us disappeared more than twelve hours several times in a short time. <br><br>  We, of course, tried to express our bewilderment to Clodo: we wrote first politely, then angrily, then we called first politely, then angrily.  In this regard, we are forced to say that ‚ÄúTechnical support 24/7/365‚Äù may be uninterrupted, but it is very slow: it was not possible to achieve sane comments from technical support staff the first time.  And when it was possible, the explanations added questions, not answers. <br><br>  Here, for example, somehow everything was ‚Äúdue to an engineer error‚Äù - the human factor, everything was wrong, the engineer was mistaken, there could be anyone.  It was only after this that his colleagues seemed to be too enthusiastic about educational work: the guilty engineer rushed the whole company for suggestion of repentance and worked on it for eight hours, otherwise how to explain that the error had not been fixed all this time and the websites continued to lie like they were? <br><br>  Or, the next time Clodo moved to another data center.  The news is generally good, but why did they do it at the height of the work week and during the day, and not at night from Saturday to Sunday, when customer losses are minimal?  And, most importantly, why are they so impulsively going to move that they did not have time to send out a newsletter for clients with a warning? <br><br>  And then our friends from Claudo changed the file system.  Also useful thing, approx.  Again, they changed me during the day, and not when it would be more convenient for the client, but we already had time to get used to this situation.  But they - hop!  - something in this system was damaged there, so much so that our sites instantly fell ill and died.  Again, probably, the human factor - whether the former re-educated engineer did not fully realize everything, or whether the new employee showed confusion. <br><br>  This is already - well, not at any gate, but if it is long and difficult to look for ornate explanations, then it can also be understood: it is possible that damage has been imposed on them this month or evil enemies gnawed vital secret wires with their teeth. <br><br>  Our own hands, too, are growing from the right place: well, the file system on our machine has been damaged, so we will spend our time and return everything to our projects, as it was, even if the respected host Claudo will provide us with our backups. <br><br>  <b>Ta-da-dam!</b>  <b>- and there are no backups!</b>  Lost, lost, the enemies devoured.  No, that's it.  Cool cloud hosting Clodo, from which it was only required to save our work, somehow did not bother to take care of backup copies. <br><br>  At this point in the story, our censorship words end.  Therefore, we will not quote how we expressed our sadness, pain and the greatest bewilderment to the cloudy Clodo. <br><br>  We can only say that within a few weeks, in addition to working on the implementation of the current business needs of our clients, we had to work even in Stakhanov‚Äôs volumes to bring the lost material back to square one.  Summer, the sun, the sky is clear, people are walking, and the workers are sitting in the office and cleaning up the mistakes behind cloudy Claude.  Because we, as has already been said, love to do our work efficiently, and are ready to correct mistakes, even if they are strangers, in order to preserve the quality result.  We - we repeat - it seems that professionalism is manifested in this.  But now, before we start cooperation with any company, we will find out more thoroughly what they mean by professionalism, since, as it turned out, this can be understood differently. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/35d/e36/418/35de364189297637458e8f6be9b847ec.png"></div></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/126140/">https://habr.com/ru/post/126140/</a></p>
