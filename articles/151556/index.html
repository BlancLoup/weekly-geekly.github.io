  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Confession</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"><img src="http://im7-tub-ru.yandex.net/i?id=432349478-54-72&amp;n=17" alt="image"><br>  Hello!  My name is Ruslan, I am an <s>alcoholic</s> entrepreneur.  Well, as an entrepreneur?  Perhaps even a businessman, or a freelancer.  In fact, I am a contractor, but the problem is that I work with the state on tenders, i.e.  I carry all the costs of the object myself, apparently I can even be called an investor, because I invest money, pick up brigades, <s>go to tax with Vaseline</s> , pay taxes (in the word I pay emphasis on the first A).  I have a family.  We all feed off the income of this topic of mine, believe it is very small (the topic is unlikely to grow, the family is really there), and it is unlikely to ever grow (I am a realist).  For life we ‚Äã‚Äãhave enough.  Now I owe 650 000 p., I owe for taxes 120 000 rub.  and build an object at 398 000 rub., plus I want to win another object at 300-500 tr.  (I'm an optimist).  Yes, in my pocket I have 100,000 p. <br>  Everything I wrote is true.  So, if everything is ok, then: 650-120 + 398 + 100-100-140 = 788 tr.  - this is my business plan for September. <br>  If everything goes badly, then I will have nothing left but a small amount on a new topic (yes, of course, the continuation of the old one).  Attentive reader will ask - where in the example - 100, and - 140 TR?  Well, just materials on the object for 398 000 p.  they will not buy themselves, and they will not build anything out of themselves (these are materials and zp, and you got to the core :)).  Why am I starting to say this?  A week or two ago, I published a post about why you should not become an entrepreneur.  So this is exactly the repost of that confusion, but with the authors (ha-ha - the author! It‚Äôs fun, at least it sounds better than the ‚Äúcontractor‚Äù, they don‚Äôt pay for it) comments about why you should think about it before start your own business. <br>  So!  Meet the rare nonsense!  The style of presentation is not just harsh, but also rude.  But this is exactly the tub that is often simply necessary.  Perhaps I would have remained a quantity surveyor and part-time freelancer, but!  I do not regret it at all. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><img src="http://im4-tub-ru.yandex.net/i?id=354139028-38-72&amp;n=21" alt="image"><br>  Startup  If you do not do your startup - you are a sucker.  Not-not really - if you are not yet an entrepreneur, if you haven‚Äôt thrown off the employee's OK, you are definitely a sucker.  Even if you work for your uncle, you earn more than 100K and occupy a separate office, all the same - just starting your own business with a turnover of 100K per year, at home, without an office, you will be able to find true freedom, learn Zen, and of course Bill Gates (or who there is your icon) will personally fly to shake your manly hand.  And why would such a stir about this?  Even in my small town everywhere - on the radio, on television and in advertising on minibuses, the same thing - ‚ÄúBecome an entrepreneur, State support of small business, Work for yourself‚Äù.  It remains to add only one thing: ‚ÄúHurray, comrades, developed capitalism has now won!  Three cheers!  Everything.  Everybody's Free.  The planning meeting is over.  What is behind all this?  Yes, the state really wants to bring many, many small businesses out of the shadows, and that is why money is allocated for grants from small businesses (from 64K to 300K, and innovators to 5000K).  This confusion is beginning to turn heads not only to those who more or less understand why he should be engaged in business, but also to a huge number of people who are sure that all they have to do is ‚Äústir up the topic,‚Äù and that‚Äôs all you are.  And many, many people are starting to fuss - a business plan, we need a business plan!  What business plan?  Yes, no matter what - wait, everything will be ok.  On Habr√© also love to talk about freelancing and work "for yourself", or "free bread". <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/megamozg/post_images/de3/853/165/de38531658009c7728a44ccd49551b5f.jpg" alt="image"><br>  So the very first thing you should remember: every man for himself, no one owes you anything!  Support, "state support", investors - all this is worth nothing, we open paragraph 1 of article.  2 of the Civil Code of the Russian Federation and we read the definition of entrepreneurial activity ‚Äúan independent activity carried out at your own risk, aimed at systematically receiving profit from using property, selling goods, performing work or providing services by persons registered in the manner prescribed by law‚Äù and note for ourselves the main thing: ‚Äúindependent an activity at your own risk. ‚Äù  If you are worth something, then there will be investors and money, if not - there will be nothing.  So simple - a point and nothing more, nothing at all, nothing will, I can repeat to infinity so that there is no more snot "we have a super cool product, but we were not supported", I am very sorry, but your product is shit !  And they did not support him for this reason. <br><hh user="http://s.primamedia.ru/f/big/150/149710.jpg"><br>  The second thing I want to say is: imagine that you are in a casino and put everything on black, everything is really everything, or 99% of what you have, and you have a plan for which black should fall out.  So are you really ready to put everything?  Congratulations - you are an entrepreneur, or an idiot, or a gamer.  But in any case, when starting a business, you should be ready to stake everything.  Otherwise, your idea is a fiction, or you are an idiot, that there are very different things.  To make it completely clear: the casino is the market, roulette is your market sector, black is your product or service, and the plan for which black must fall is your idea, your chip, thanks to which people will buy your product or service or what are you selling there.  In the comments to the previous version of the article, the comparison with the casino and roulette was heavily criticized, but forgive me if it‚Äôs for ‚Äúblack‚Äù, i.e.  even if you yourself are not ready to supply your goods, then who will bet on it?  Investors?  They are not so stupid. <br>  In many blogs, including Habr's posts, it is possible to read that they say I, a novice entrepreneur, rented an office for a hell of a lot of money, bought super-duper equipment, and now, after 4 years of activity, I reached the break-even point.  What does it mean?  This means that you only after 4 years stopped sucking the loot from investors!  Who are your investors?  If not dad and not your subsidiary, then who are they? <br>  All this is permissible and rather normal in medium-sized business in its classical sense, usually in the real sector of the economy, often in production, where it is necessary to buy expensive equipment, rent or even better build production buildings, but certainly this does not apply to start-ups. apam, nor to just entrepreneurship. <br>  In a small business, money is always needed now.  And not a minute later.  I imagine the situation when I declare: ‚ÄúGuys, you have been bent over the whole month, but we haven‚Äôt achieved operating profit, that's why you will not get anything.  Gentlemen bankers - in the absence of profit, you also do not get fucking.  Comrade is the owner of the office that we rent - you also do not shine in this reporting period.  My children (and my wife), you eat the holy spirit "- about how many rays of diarrhea will pour out on me, and not only rays - you will surely beat and beat hard, and maybe everything will not be so bad - ride in a good car for a country walk, true in the trunk. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/megamozg/post_images/e17/d96/2a1/e17d962a1661fed2c83452aa02256a62.jpg" alt="image"><br>  So this is what I‚Äôm writing here - to start my own business, keep it afloat, make a profit - it‚Äôs not just difficult, but also risky, it‚Äôs often unbearable, but if you‚Äôre ready to put everything on black, then put it you will like this and you will remember with a smile the times when everything was simple and ‚Äúfrom nine to six‚Äù, and not from ‚Äú0.00 to 0.00‚Äù. <br><img src="http://im5-tub-ru.yandex.net/i?id=275265691-32-72&amp;n=17" alt="image"></hh></div>
