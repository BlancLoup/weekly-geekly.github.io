Since I have been living in Brazil for almost 14 years, I found most of the changes described.  And while working in the computer field I also, in fact, can write about what the article was silent about or did not enter into details. <br><br>  You can tell a lot about what, so I chose what I consider the most interesting.  If you have questions - write, I will try to answer in detail.  Yes, and this is my first post on Habr√©, so I apologize in advance if something is wrong. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a>

      So, we moved to Brazil with our family in May 1996.  His father is a physics professor who works at a physics and technology department, but has not received a salary in the past few months.  Mother is a music teacher.  Well, I + two brothers.  There was no particular prospect for the money that the government allocated was clearly not enough, so there was no point in thinking about moving. <br><br>  After moving to Brazil, I went to a regular school, where I actually learned Portuguese (I already knew English and Spanish, well, quite a bit of French in the last year I had to learn at school).  After school, he entered the university for a computer science course, then he made a master degree and last year he defended his doctoral (phd).  He worked with his studies - in a small company called MSTECH, mainly with Linux, programming, and networks.  There were many projects in Ardence (they recently bought Citrix), Intel, Microsoft, and Brazilian OEMs (Positivo, Procomp, Itautec).  In 2007 I got an internship at Microsoft, I worked there with NTFS.  Well, since 2008 I have been working in Mandriva. <br><br>  Since over the past 10 years I have been working directly in the computer field, then progress is noticeable at first glance.  In 1998, when I entered the computer faculty, they used netware, 386/486 (there were a couple of Pentiums), 10-megabit networks (coaxial).  The Internet was pretty fast - 2Mbits for the entire university.  And we must bear in mind that the best universities in Brazil are free, those that the government supports.  In paid go mainly because of the large competition for a place in all public universities.  Well, education there in most cases makes you want something better. <br><br>  During the time that I studied there (1998 - 2004, that is, the university itself and the master degree), the situation improved incredibly.  The weakest computers in 2003-2004 were P4 with 256MB RAM.  The network has become at least 100Mbits, mainly with Ethernet, and various departments are connected with optics.  The number of computers has also increased just incredible.  And all this thanks to government programs. <br><br>  As for training on computer subjects - in most universities it is at a very high level.  At <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_University_of_S%25C3%25A3o_Carlos">my university</a> For 4 years we have studied: <br><ul><li>  networks (from basic concepts to low-level programming).  In practice, we studied both Ethernet networks, and optics and wireless networks. </li><li>  programming.  Main languages ‚Äã‚Äã(at that time): Pascal, C, C ++.  Java, php (optional), prolog, lisp.  For java, there were special programming lessons for the web, for C, the task was to learn and change something in the Linux kernel. </li><li>  Database.  We studied the theory (one semester), and in practice we worked with ingress, oracle, sybase, mysql, postgresql, cache.  Pretty deep level. </li><li>  software engineering.  A lot of things, most of all the lessons on this topic, but I already forgot the main thing safely :).  But there was a lot of material, from tests to reverse engineering, human-machine interaction, even extreme programming and (a little) agile. </li><li>  iron.  Also quite a lot.  From simple logic, electrical circuits, chips and oscilloscopes to von Neumann, the insides of x86 architecture, programming for 8086, creating systems in xelinx / altera.  My course was called computer science, there is another parallel - computer engineering.  They even more with iron work, up to create fpga. </li><li>  AI.  It is also quite a lot, from search algorithms, then genetic algorithms and neural networks. </li><li>  Operating Systems.  In these lessons, we mainly learn on Linux, unlike others, where most teachers are accustomed to using pirated copies of windows.  Although in recent years fewer and fewer people know only windows, which is good news.  Once the conversation turned to piracy, once Microsoft decided to demand compensation for pirated copies of Windows.  For a week in the whole university, all pirate installations were demolished and Linux was installed :).  After that, Microsoft offered huge discounts for all programs (including the office and visual studio), so everything was back to square one.  But it is very pleasing that the majority of young teachers use mainly Linux. </li></ul><br><br>  In my opinion, they learn VERY well.  Teachers are also paid quite well (if there is a doctoral degree, then they pay from 20 minimum wages + bonuses and grants).  Somewhere from 4000 US $ per month is obtained.  In addition, there are many government programs that give grants, scholarships, research money, computers, and so on.  And it gives results - if you look, in most international congresses there is at least someone from Brazil. <br><br>  Returning to the topic of Linux and open source.  The government puts on computers, and it gives pretty good results.  Most of the official documents in pdf or odf, although doc also come across.  Most computers come with Linux (although many later put a pirated copy of Windows).  Elections at all levels are electronic, so the results become known in a couple of hours.  All checks and financial documents are issued in electronic form.  Tax programs work over the Internet, and the government releases versions for windows, linux and java. <br><br>  In general, through the Internet you can find a lot of things, including information about all bills, public procurement, and about what every deputy asks for money (and how they spend it).  Although it does not save from corruption, but it is not visible.  Basically, you learn about curry scandals on TV, in practice in life I have not met with this here.  Although they say that in poor states it is quite a common thing (well, on public procurement, this also often happens - I came across this myself). <br><br>  The Internet has developed very well in recent years.  I have not seen modems for several years.  Internet on 6MBits + cable TV on a bunch of channels costs about 50 US $ per month.  Computers are modern and relatively cheap - for example, laptops from asus, acer, dell, hp with core2duo 2Ghz + 3GB RAM + 250GB disk cost about 750 US $ now.  Brazilian laptops (positivo, itautec, intelbras, cce) with the same configuration and with Linux are 20-30 percent cheaper.  3G networks are almost everywhere, so you can just sit on the beach with a laptop in hand and read Habr :). <br><br>  Crime ... There are, of course.  But very dependent on the city and district.  Personally, I did not come across, but I do not go at night through poor areas and favelas with a camera around my neck, a purse in my pocket and the words ‚ÄúI am a tourist‚Äù on a T-shirt :).  In Rio de Janeiro and Sao Paulo, crime is greater, especially in some areas.  In some other cities, it is practically nonexistent.  It all depends on the point of view - if you believe the local newspapers, then in Russia you can‚Äôt even walk a meter without protection. <br><br>  Is it expensive to live here?  I would say no.  The food is quite cheap, housing depends on the city and region.  If you rent a house with 5 rooms, then a month can go as much as 300 as well as US $ 3,000.  You can rent a house or an apartment for a student scholarship and still have a pretty good life.  A lot of cars (almost all imported, but going here - volkswagen, GM, ford, fiat, honda, toyota, kia, hyundai, etc.).  Occasionally I meet richer cars, such as chrysler, porsche, land rover.  A couple of times I saw ferrari and lamborghini :).  But even without a car, you can live quite well - there are buses everywhere, the subway is also available in some cities.  But the train - it is a rarity, and only freight. <br><br>  In general, Brazil is a very big country, and it varies greatly from state to state.  The richest and most populated states are located in the center and in the south.  In the northern states of the desert and the poor.  Although the latest government programs are trying to deal with this poor, but in most cases unsuccessfully. <br><br>  From the point of view of an IT specialist, there are a lot of opportunities for work  It is interesting to live.  Heat and seas and oceans nearby.  So you can live and interesting. <br><br>  <b>PS:</b> Followed the advice and moved to "I Migrate." </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/88834/">https://habr.com/ru/post/88834/</a></p>
