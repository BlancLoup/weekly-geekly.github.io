  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Platform of server solutions (PaaS) for mass Internet projects on cloud technology</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Online applications in which users interact with each other are very popular in the Internet environment.  These are games, social networks, training systems, corporate programs and others.  The number of Internet users and as a result of Internet applications is growing steadily.  To serve all the clients of the network program, and there may be millions of them, very powerful software is required.  During the advent of social networks, the number of users of online applications increased by several orders of magnitude.  But not only web sites and online applications (MMO games, social applications, corporate applications and others) experience a heavy load, but with the advent of HTML5 web applications will become interactive and require real-time processing (chats, voice, instant messages, MMO games). ). <a name="habracut"></a><br>  Developing the next server solution for the MMO project, I decided to find out what lies behind PaaS, SaaS, IaaS.  As it turned out, everything that we have developed up to now has quite definite names.  On the Internet, many people use these names, even without understanding their essence.  Therefore, I decided to write a post to show the structure of the components of a distributed, cloud system. <br>  Here is a summary of cloud technologies and terminology. <br>  <b>SaaS</b> (software as a service is when a supplier develops an Internet application and independently manages it, giving customers access to software via the Internet. That is, in fact, it rents Software Services), <br>  <b>PaaS</b> (platform as a service is the provision of an integrated platform for developing, testing, deploying and supporting applications as a Service Designer service) <br>  <b>IaaS</b> (infrastructure as a service) is the provision of computer infrastructure as a service. Hardware - servers, data storage systems, client systems, network equipment. Operating systems and system software. ‚ÄúCloud hosting‚Äù). <br><br><img src="http://www.goldingame.ru/saas.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  The PaaS system has been developed - with the help of which any developer in a very short time will be able to create a sufficiently powerful server solution for his project, be it a game, a social application, a corporate program, etc.

    <img src="http://www.goldingame.ru/saas_struct.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Social networks and social multiplayer applications are growing like mushrooms.  The real-time PaaS system very well meets the needs of social applications + adds real-time to them, which is very necessary for good customer interaction.  Where can PaaS be used?  I will give a few examples. <br><br>  <b>Example 1 the</b> developer has created a <b>social game</b> and he needs a server - he opens the editor and in a matter of minutes, proceeding from the finished template, creates an automatically scalable server system for himself.  One click of the mouse and the system works and users go. <br><br>  <b>Example 2 A</b> company is looking for a powerful server solution for its large <b>MMORPG</b> game - its developer also creates a structure through the editor and adds its own logic scripts + database structure and gets a powerful server solution. <br><br>  <b>Example 3 A</b> company, for example, a pharmaceutical company, creates for itself a <b>corporate server solution</b> .  The company has dozens and hundreds of branches.  In this case, in real time, each branch sees the availability of goods, the passage of goods, orders, real-time communication through their secure voice conference with access to the phone. <br><br>  <b>Example 4 The</b> <b>social network of the</b> new generation in HTML5, where all changes occur in real time, will find its solution in PaaS. <br><br>  <b>Example 5</b> <b>A</b> real-time <b>training system</b> , for example, lectures with a virtual whiteboard, where a real-time lecturer can mark new material (marker), drag pictures, videos from his PC, and everyone can see and listen to the lecturer's voice.  Also, the lecturer can give a voice to the student to answer at the blackboard.  Testing in real time. <br><br>  PaaS system will allow the developer to create a server part of the project in a short time and focus exclusively on the main functions and marketing, without wasting time on technical parts.  This is the next stage in the development of cloud technologies and the provision of services.  I hope, in this short post, I slightly lifted the veil over what is hidden behind the fashionable words today (IaaS, PaaS, SaaS). <br><br>  With pleasure I will answer all questions. <br><br></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/99084/">https://habr.com/ru/post/99084/</a></p>
