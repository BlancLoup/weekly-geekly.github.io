  <section class="page js-page"><h1>The first introductory session of the AIP was held</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"><img align="right" hspace="10" src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/e8f/41d/ef1/e8f41def13ab7889491fe75127cc1b8c.jpg">  On February 1, 2010, <strong>the Internet Developer Association</strong> held the first introductory session at the Microsoft office.  The event was attended by about fifty people from twenty-six companies.  The event showed that the issues raised by the <strong>AIR,</strong> are really relevant in the web environment.  Moreover, besides the Moscow companies, the event was attended by studios and agencies from other cities of Russia: Ulyanovsk, Yekaterinburg, St. Petersburg and Novosibirsk.  We would like to note that for the AIR it is extremely important that the questions raised by its participants find consonance in the minds of the largest possible number of colleagues in Russia and even abroad. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a><img align="left" hspace="10" src="http://internet-association.ru/upload/imagelib/s_12652107891265210789image063.jpg">  It was curious to observe how the heads of the web studios who came to the event did not get to know each other, started conversations and discussions, found common customers, jobs and other points of contact.  Thus, not yet embarking on the event itself, we have already completed one of the tasks of the AIR.  After all, AIR is nothing but a community of website developers and communication between them, knowing each other in person, this is one of our tasks. <br><br>  We initially planned to limit the number of participants for a number of reasons: first and foremost, we are not trying to arrange a mass initiation rite, but on the contrary, we are trying to address the choice of the new members of the Association with an informed and balanced approach.  The format chosen by us assumes not so much and not only the presentation of the AIR, but also the receipt of live feedback from you, the market participants.  Therefore, we apologize to all those who did not receive an invitation to the first session and inform that a new tour will be organized in the near future, to which you will certainly be invited.

      A new form is open for new participants on the AIR website, through which you can send an application for participation in subsequent sessions. <br><br>  Now to the essence of the event: <br><br>  <strong>What did we want?</strong> <br><img align="right" hspace="10" src="http://internet-association.ru/upload/imagelib/s_12652111601265211160image211.jpg"><ul><li>  Deliver in as simple as possible our goals and values ‚Äã‚Äãthat we share. </li><li>  Inform you about the challenges we and you face, as we see them now.  Report on the solutions we have developed. </li><li>  To defeat questions like ‚Äúwhat are YOU going to do?‚Äù, ‚ÄúAnd why are YOU not doing this and that?‚Äù And building a dialogue along the lines of ‚Äúand let us also do this here.‚Äù  It is very important for us that all potential participants understand one simple thing - each of us is the person whose hands will create our common future, who will set the rules and teach new generations to play them.  We are all on the same side. </li><li>  Get feedback and hear constructive criticism, suggestions, suggestions. </li><li>  In the end, to gather and expand the ranks of like-minded people advocating reasonable decisions and transparent rules in the web space. </li></ul>  <strong>What have you achieved?</strong> <br><br>  In our opinion, we managed to achieve our goals.  Suffice it to say that the majority of the session participants expressed a desire to actively participate in the activities of the Association, becoming full members of it, and even outlined their interests and priorities. <br><br>  <strong>How was it?</strong> <br><br>  As it was supposed initially, the event was held in the form of three sections: <br><img align="right" hspace="10" src="http://internet-association.ru/upload/imagelib/s_12652113431265211343image219.jpg"><ol><li>  The presentation part consisted in the disclosure of the ‚Äúmilitary secret‚Äù of the AIR, that is, for what we plan to be friends and what goals to achieve together.  The heads of the Association‚Äôs committees presented both its activities as a whole and the substantive activities of the committees headed by them.  It is positive that many of the points gave rise to discussion and questions. </li><li>  The eating and drinking part consisted of drinking tea and coffee, kindly provided by Microsoft, eating everything and communicating in an informal setting.  Communication prevailed, so they did not eat everything. </li><li>  Part of the sociable consisted in throwing questions from both parties and in obtaining weighted answers.  In the climax, apparently, a final and irrevocable consensus was reached. </li></ol>  <strong>Let's sum up!</strong> <br><ul><li>  Of the 26 companies present, the overwhelming majority filled out application forms right at the event.  Apparently, the first session will double the number of members of the Association. </li><li>  We have started the preparation of the second event, which will be held in late February. </li><li>  At the moment, the processing of the collected questionnaires and the preparation of documents for the entry. </li></ul>  <strong>If you are interested in our activities, then you can:</strong> <br><br><img align="right" hspace="10" src="http://internet-association.ru/upload/imagelib/s_12652115801265211580image116.jpg"><br><ul><li>  Learn more about the Association at: </li><li>  <a href="http://www.internet-association.ru/">http://www.internet-association.ru/</a> </li><li>  Fill in the form for joining the AIR: </li><li>  <a href="http://internet-association.ru/rus/form.php">http://internet-association.ru/rus/form.php</a> </li><li>  Visit our next event, which will be held in late February.
