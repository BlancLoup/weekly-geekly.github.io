  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Yandex.Money: new user agreement</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  September 27, 2012, a new agreement comes into force for all users of the Yandex.Money system.  In the agreement, as usual in such documents, there is too much ‚Äúbukaf‚Äù, and hardly anyone will read it to the end.  For charabrakat given squeeze - the basis of the meaning of this document. <img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/28b/819/929/28b81992955d49233ec7698fd006f6d7.jpg" alt="image"><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  <b>1</b> .  The new agreement arose in connection with the requirements of the law ‚ÄúOn the National Payment System‚Äù and because of the transfer of rights to the service to a special organization OOO Yandex.Money NGO.  OOO NPO Yandex.Money has received a license from the Bank of Russia for basic banking operations in rubles and foreign currency.  The agreement is binding on all users of the system. <br><br>  <b>2</b>  Yandex.Money will carry out the identification of the Client in order to transfer funds without opening a bank account in accordance with the requirements of the legislation of the Russian Federation on countering the legalization (laundering) of criminal proceeds and the financing of terrorism.  According to the results of the Identification procedure, the Client is assigned the status of an identified one (has a personalized Wallet).  A client who has not passed the Identification procedure has the status of an unidentified Client (has a non-personalized Wallet).  Depending on the type of wallet, various restrictions may apply.  For example: for personalized Wallets, the balance of Electronic Money at any time cannot exceed <b>100,000 (one hundred thousand) rubles</b> or an amount in foreign currency equivalent to the specified amount at the official rate of the Bank of Russia.  For non-personalized Wallets, the balance of Electronic Money at any time may not exceed <b>15,000 (fifteen thousand) rubles</b> .  For non-personalized Wallets, the total amount of E-money transfers and returns of E-money balances using one non-personalized Wallet cannot exceed 40000 (forty thousand) rubles during a calendar month.

      <b>3</b>  OOO NPO Yandex.Money has received a license from the Bank of Russia for banking operations in rubles and foreign currency. <br><br>  <b>4</b>  Settlements with the Client are made in rubles.  In case of receipt of funds in another currency, the Operator recalculates into rubles at the exchange rate of the currency set by the Central Bank of the Russian Federation on the day of execution of the Client‚Äôs order, reduced by 2%.  As before, the service operates 24 hours 7 days a week, and provides services for money transfer operations and payments.  As before, NPOs have the right to charge fees for making transfers. <br><br>  <b>5</b>  NPOs have the right to block the Client‚Äôs Wallet: on the initiative of the authorized state bodies, on the initiative of the Client, on their own initiative.  You might think that if OOO Yandex.Money LLC wants, then by agreement your money will be taken away, and you must accept this condition.  However, the terms of ‚Äúfair weaning of money from citizens‚Äù are still painted - this is a violation by the user of the Agreement, the use of the Wallet, if there are suspicions of unauthorized access, in the case of non-standard or unusually complex schemes of operations that differ from the usual procedure of operations characteristic of NPO Clients , in case of meeting NPO requirements established by the legislation of the Russian Federation (laundering, terrorism, etc.), in the case of Technical overdraft of the E-money balance. <br><br>  <b>6</b>  The Client does not have the right to use the programs and apply other measures that allow the Client to hide the technical characteristics of the Internet connection for using the Wallet from the NPO. <br><br>  <b>7</b>  <b>Depositing money by legal entities or individual entrepreneurs is not allowed</b> .  The purse can be used only by individuals who do not conduct formal business activities.  It is clearly spelled out that the client‚Äôs duty is not to conduct virtual account operations related to entrepreneurship and making money.  The client is obliged to provide the NPO with information upon its request, as well as documents confirming the source of funds in the Virtual Account, the basis for the transaction.  In this way, either work in the black or use other services. <br><br>  <b>8</b>  The NPO is not liable for losses incurred as a result of the Customer depositing funds that cannot be credited due to exceeding the limits of the rest of the Electronic Money (the limits are 15 and 100 thousand rubles).  Watch for the rest of the money in your wallet! <br><br>  <b>UPD120824</b> to item 7: representatives of Yandex on Habr√© promise not to monitor users and not to knock unnecessarily, see the comments for details. <br><br>  <b>UPD120824</b> to item 8: according to Yandex representatives (not confirmed yet) - the balance of money in the wallet over the limit (15 and 100 thousand rubles for unauthorized and authorized, respectively) is not lost, but simply becomes unavailable for transfers and payments. <br><br>  [ <b>Links</b> ] <br><br>  <b>1</b> .  <a href="http://money.yandex.ru/offer/">The new agreement on the use of the Yandex.Money system</a> . </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/150152/">https://habr.com/ru/post/150152/</a></p>
