My name is Andrey, I work at Veeam Software.  Since there was only <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/veeam/blog/187388/" title="How to start a billion company">one article</a> about Habr√© about my company, and even that is more like a historical excursion, I would like to fill in the void and tell about the modern Russian office of Veeam. <br><br>  For those who do not know, just remind you that the IT startup Veeam was founded in 2006 by a small group of St. Petersburg specialists, and today, after 8 years of its existence, the company has 1,300+ employees worldwide. <br><br>  Who is interested to know the details, please under the cat. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/c2a/e05/fcd/c2ae05fcd7787dc1ab4dac10f5ef65ee.jpg"><br><a name="habracut"></a>

      When I studied at the university, I always thought that in order to work in a modern international company I would have to leave Russia at least to Europe, and even to North America.  However, when I got to work at Veeam in St. Petersburg, I realized that I was wrong. <br><br><h2>  About company </h2><br>  As mentioned above, Veeam Software (contrary to the common misconception pronounced ‚ÄúWim‚Äù, not ‚ÄúViam‚Äù) was founded in 2006.  The company itself is a project of several people, including Ratmir Timashev and Andrei Baronov.  Friends in life and partners in the previous project, ‚ÄúAelita Software‚Äù, they invested in the sale of Aelita to Veeam. <br><br>  Today, the company makes monitoring and backup products for VMware vSphere and Microsoft Hyper-V based virtual machines.  This direction turned out to be promising, and most importantly, profitable against the background of widespread virtualization (of course, provided that you offer a really good product). <br><br><h2>  The structure of the company </h2><br>  Over the 8 years of its existence, the company has gone from an unknown startup in the field of virtual media backup products to a place in the quadrant of the ‚Äúvisionaries of the industry‚Äù in the ‚Äúmagic quadrant‚Äù of the Gartner analytical company.  Currently, it employs more than 1,300 people in 17 offices around the world (in America, Europe and Asia).  One of the largest of them are 2 offices in St. Petersburg - all product development (R &amp; D and Q &amp; A) is concentrated here, multilingual sales, technical support and marketing teams work. <br><br>  We will tell more about each of them.  Marketing and Sales teams are located in BC Plaza. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/6f6/6ce/426/6f66ce4264eb1b006bf45c11159f4185.jpg"><br><br>  The developers (as well as testers and tech support) are located in the Kondratievsky BC. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/49c/c19/6c2/49cc196c2d80bd0fbc9ac0cdac89de31.jpg"><br><br><h2>  Office </h2><br>  Since I work in the BC Plaza, I will talk more about him.  Office Veeam occupies 4 floors.  Access inside, naturally, on the magnetic admission.  In the design of a lot of glass and green (the color of the company, well rhymes with the name: green Veeam). <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/af5/32d/df2/af532ddf245bd5ec11a1531361b4d8e9.jpg"><br><br>  Those who come to the company, as it should be, are greeted <s>with bread by the</s> girls at the reception. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/313/874/a81/313874a81cabc55fedba0b5047469608.jpg"><br><br>  For the reception hangs a map of Eurasia, on which are marked with points of the place of birth of employees. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/f76/2aa/401/f762aa401ea6e40f70624fa09812e044.jpg"><br><br>  Information about corporate values ‚Äã‚Äãcan be seen everywhere, for example, ‚ÄúWe are optimists and believe in ourselves‚Äù, ‚ÄúWe help each other add success‚Äù, ‚ÄúWe are sincere and open‚Äù and ‚ÄúWe are self-sufficient, but always happy to see new talented people in the team‚Äù. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/138/11e/cf9/13811ecf90918efc923cc287813693f9.jpg"><br><br>  The design used elements of the subject of star wars.  The names of the meeting rooms - the names of the planets.  Every time I shudder at the invitation to meet at the "death star". <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/9c3/80a/415/9c380a41518ca126c2ba9e0b4484c202.png"><br><br>  Negotiating Tatooine and local jokes. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/46b/388/f97/46b388f975a52c2e634530a56694d683.jpg"><br><br>  Inside her. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/d1e/a40/cb9/d1ea40cb93d761a20375c8d6cf214a61.jpg"><br><br>  On the floors there is a kitchen where you can safely eat and enjoy the beautiful view of the Neva.  Coffee, tea, milk, cookies - unlimited access :) <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/bd1/18e/a25/bd118ea2557369899c109b2b6045dc49.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/9bb/e8a/982/9bbe8a98279b40cd0d444fe7dcd2b3bb.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/326/44d/e96/32644de96695bfc56c4c11f1cd8bf53b.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/84d/0d4/db5/84d0d4db5a12e80bb597823944d22ede.jpg"><br><br>  General view of the Neva, not only from the kitchen <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/b2f/659/1d6/b2f6591d64552cd5c7261d5142d70169.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/797/a4d/dc2/797a4ddc2b378f5e59a39635d6f9ddae.jpg"><br><br>  EMEA marketing team at work. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/467/c06/cd0/467c06cd08a496c758e9310cea2969fc.jpg"><br><br>  PR department and a small corner with awards. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/98c/21a/789/98c21a7891cf5f0aad4d53d7ede03877.jpg"><br><br>  The average age of the company's employees is 26 years.  We love young and ambitious and are not ‚Äúafraid‚Äù to attract senior students.  In the photo - <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/users/sysmetic/" class="user_link">sysmetic</a> conducts one of the lectures for students in the specialty ‚Äúproduct management‚Äù. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/0a3/11c/04f/0a311c04fad79b635458fec2c001e5ca.jpg"><br><br>  The work schedule in the company is quite comfortable for people.  Mandatory business hours of presence in the office - from 12.00 to 18.00.  The rest of the time is flexible, but most people prefer to work in the evening.  No bullying and no traffic jams. <br><br>  Often, employees need to travel to other company offices and / or work conferences.  Of course, everything depends on the position and field of activity, but when you are in the state, you need to be prepared for this. <br>  The photo shows the Barcelona airport during the VMworld 2013 conference. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/307/db4/da8/307db4da8744d4b0024d2caeb0a41485.jpg"><br><br>  Since the company is international, communication between employees from different countries takes place in English.  But, of course, the most interesting thing is to meet colleagues offline, after electronic communication.  Meeting a foreigner in the kitchen for a cup of coffee quickly became a habit. <br><br>  The design also includes flags of the countries with which this or that office corner works. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/232/671/a26/232671a261babe9b062ba94360d2e138.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/793/00a/c5f/79300ac5f7a4369afc4dbebe5d3a8630.jpg"><br><br>  The open atmosphere makes a great impression: everyone is very friendly, greet each other in the kitchen, want a "pleasant appetite" even if they do not know the names :) <br><br>  The company has a developed corporate culture and encourages a healthy lifestyle.  We have our own football team, the guys play in the amateur league between the companies. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/c45/99e/c71/c4599ec7186373ef23f71804b1293004.jpg"><br><br>  Every week - pass beach volleyball training <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/9ce/127/85c/9ce12785c57168ab69cfdaf42cc1ef8d.jpg"><br><br>  In both offices there are tables for the kicker and even professional players who share their experience and are always happy to show a master class. <br><br>  I just found a busy party. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/7b7/865/bb5/7b7865bb594038afc9030acfb9a0c176.jpg"><br><br>  We also have a corporate library offline - you can take any book and read.  Well, if the required book did not appear, but it is needed for productive work, then it can be ordered from HR.  In the photo - only one department of the library <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/a79/77c/35a/a7977c35ae7f567e63e9120c5c6224db.jpg"><br><br>  Teams have trips and team buildings, most often - this is a trip out of town, cooking classes, curling. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/ee3/aaf/d68/ee3aafd68e7b343e358f5fcfadac3aa2.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/19a/fc1/cab/19afc1cabbfee76990a10e072146d540.png"><br><br><h2>  Conclusion </h2><br>  The company is developing at a fast pace, we are waiting for the team to increase by the end of 2014 by about 30%.  In October, Veeam will organize its first international conference, VeeamON 2014, in Las Vegas for customers and partners, where more than 1,000 participants are expected.  Visitors are waiting for 3 days of training, communication and, of course, interesting surprises, which cannot yet be revealed. <br><br>  I would also like to remind you that we have a separate <a href="http://careers.veeam.com/">career portal</a> , and you should look for fresh vacancies there. <br><br>  Come visit, we are always glad to you;) <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/4e4/20b/330/4e420b33006686ef4052bc1503b47282.jpg"><br><br><h2>  Bonus </h2><br>  As a bonus, I can offer an <a href="http://vk.com/video-21019432_168247221">excellent video</a> from the guys from the sales team, in which you can see their view on the work in the company. <br><br><h2>  Resources </h2><br>  <a href="http://veeam.com/">Veeam Company Website</a> <br>  <a href="http://careers.veeam.com/">Career portal</a> <br>  <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/veeam/blog/187388/">How to start a billionth company</a> (Habr) </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/221385/">https://habr.com/ru/post/221385/</a></p>
