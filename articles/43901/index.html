  <section class="page js-page"><h1>About Leadership and Management</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Recently, I have been quite actively interested in leadership and management.  In view of the new life positions, this is important to me.  And given my interest in this topic - maybe it will be very useful to me in the distant future.  I do not know how it will be.  But I want to try to share my current perception of this sensitive issue.  Most likely in the future I will change my mind.  But now I form it like this. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h3>  People create their own leaders </h3><br>  I read various books by various authors on project and people management.  All authors have their own opinion on the topic of leadership.  I have no doubt that my opinion will ultimately not coincide with any of those that I am reading now.  For experience plays a big role here.  People often create their own leader exactly the way they would like to see him.  Some have created one.  Other others.  From the leader often remain only dreams.  Everything else is brought in by those who follow him.  Therefore, every good leader has his own methods.  His vision.  It is created by his followers. <br><br><h3>  People follow not the leader but his dream. </h3><br>  Little can make a person act the way he wants.  One of these magical things is a dream.  Few people are ready to do something for the sake of a certain "Uncle Vanya".  But many will gladly take up the cause if they understand that this is their business too.  That ‚ÄúUncle Vanya‚Äù doesn‚Äôt want something from them that only he needs, but that they stand up and follow their dreams.  For a common dream.  In this development, leadership is the ability to manage the aspirations of people, their motivation.  The ability to give everyone his personal dream for which he is ready to get up from his knees and act with all his might.  Like a real person that is committed to their future. <br><br><h3>  Experience solves a lot </h3><br>  Errors.  Mistakes make everything and always.  Experience is what happens when mistakes are realized.  Often it is experience that determines success.  Neither technology nor technology can give what experience can give.  If the leader wants his team to be the best.  He should bet on the experience of those who follow him.  Experience is so personal part of a person that it is impossible to simply ‚Äútake and share‚Äù it.  Experience is gained from mistakes.  That is why it is impossible to consider mistakes as something shameful.  This is just another step into the future.  It is only necessary to realize it.  Understand what leads to such errors.  Use this error to raise the level of the whole team.

    <h3>  Obstacles as a negative factor </h3><br>  Obstacles in the path of life only strengthen the character.  Only add experience and cohesion to the team.  But do not spend all the time to fight obstacles.  It's too much.  In the end, eliminating all obstacles is not the goal of existence.  Often it is much more important to get to the finish line than to clear the track of the trees and mud puddles that fell on it after the rain. <br><br><h3>  Meaning of life </h3><br>  Almost all people live for something.  For the sake of something valuable.  For some, it is an aid to living beings.  For others, it is happiness.  The third important manufacturability.  If you gather people so that each of them will complement the others.  If the leader is able to organize the work so that any of his followers will strive for their highest goal and together they will do a great job - they will achieve a lot.  The pursuit of a dream and the existence in harmony with its meaning of life can play a big role. <br><br>  Perhaps others will look and wonder how this is possible.  But if there is a desire and no obstacles - everything is possible.  :) <br><br>  <a href="http://nekt.ru/2008/11/o-liderstve-i-upravlenii/">¬© mine</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/43901/">https://habr.com/ru/post/43901/</a></p>
