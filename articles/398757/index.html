  <section class="page js-page"><h1>HD home surveillance camera: FlirFX</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  This year, the Russian security company Gulf Stream has launched the sale of FlirFX cameras in Russia.  Flir has been building thermal imagers and other sensors for over fifty years.  The new surveillance camera is suitable for home use, for installation on the street in a special casing, as a DVR in a car or an action camera, it shoots in Full HD format and stores data in the cloud or on a microSD card.  One of the interesting features of the device is the Rapid Recap function, which allows you to view all the events per day not in an accelerated mode, but in parallel with each other. <br><br>  I use this camera for a while to communicate with my daughter while I sit in the office: how Big Brother is watching her.  But this is not the only way to use such a device.  Read the details under the cut. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/77b/47f/766/77b47f7666e651ad946f7c29dccc674d.png"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h4>  Equipment </h4><br>  The camera comes in a large cardboard box.  Inside there is a camera itself, a stand for it, an adapter for mounting the camera on a wall or ceiling with dowels and screws, a very long USB cable with an adapter, plus instructions.  The kit with the camera, to my great regret, does not include a casing for outdoor installation, a stand for installation in a car and a waterproof case for using FlirFX as an action camera.  You will have to buy these things separately.

FlirFX will look appropriate on a table or <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/BL3MKOWAjFU/%3Ftaken-by%3Divan_sychev">on a shelf</a> among books and glass figures of animals.  On the front side of the camera is a microphone for recording sound and a speaker for two-way communication.  Also under the glass hidden LEDs for night shooting. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/6c9/b4e/f30/6c9b4ef300144cee8211a7a7b146f851.JPG"><br><br>  On the camera body are located several physical buttons.  On the top is a button for photo and video.  When disconnected from the stand, a single press of a button takes a photo, a long press starts recording in Full HD.  On the right side - the power button and Wi-Fi, to switch between the "cloud" mode and the mode of direct connection to the smartphone. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/e22/467/dfe/e22467dfef724a9685aa06f90535e3ea.JPG"><br><br>  On the right side, there is a microUSB port for charging the camera directly, without participation in the stand process, and a port for microSD.  In the kit there is already a 8GB card, it is possible to use cards up to 64GB.  Required with a class of at least 10. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/5e6/ca5/a2e/5e6ca5a2e53f4fc3929d0c0fc8b6b727.JPG"><br><br>  On the back panel - indicators of the cloud and direct connection to the smartphone via Wi-Fi. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/8b1/917/3ea/8b19173eae464970a5a660e66e96ab5d.JPG"><br><br>  A camera without a stand begins to live its own life and work from its own battery, which, according to the manufacturer, is enough for two hours.  Together with a special casing, the camera turns into an action camera. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/e01/bd1/05c/e01bd105c48c4f57858480a7b5e59090.JPG"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/25d/48b/b87/25d48bb8766246c38969837b5fd53aa6.JPG"><br><br><h4>  Functional </h4><br>  Now - about the most important: what exactly this camera can do. <br><br>  The recording goes to the cloud and is stored there for up to 30 days.  If necessary, use a microSD card, it comes in a set (8 GB).  The video is viewed in real time from the smartphone.  To transfer data, the camera connects to the network via Wi-Fi, it is possible to directly connect to the smartphone. <br><br>  The camera can operate continuously, and can be included in a specific case.  It reacts to movement, air temperature, humidity level.  In the case of movement, you can choose a zone outside of which FlirFX will not pay attention to what is happening.  In the case of temperature, the range is set in degrees Celsius or Fahrenheit.  The same with humidity.  At each event, the signal is sent to the smartphone. <br><br>  FlirFX can shoot video up to 1080p.  An interesting feature is to increase the viewing angle to 160 degrees: the whole room will be immediately visible.  Night shooting is possible thanks to six infrared LEDs. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/24a/3c2/44e/24a3c244ed3507f8b735e2ff0899971c.png" width="500"><br>  <em>Standard viewing angle</em> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/634/ee5/911/634ee59118d7ec1a49a5fec1aa96336a.png" width="500"><br>  <em>Extended viewing angle</em> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/a45/ba0/49e/a45ba049e87a36907b200ac3ab6b80df.png" width="500"><br>  <em>Shooting in total darkness</em> <br><br>  If in the case of iron I find it difficult to isolate something out of the ordinary, then the software turned out to be interesting.  Namely - the RapidRecap function.  From the material that was shot in a few hours or a day, the application forms a short minute video clip, in which everything that happens during this time can be seen.  It was interesting to see in a minute how my wife, in the number of several characters (each time is displayed), simultaneously cleaned the apartment, fed her daughter, watched TV and ran around the room.  For obvious reasons, I will not publish this video, but from the example below everything will be clear. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/9-nwfFg5yiI" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><h4>  application </h4><br>  FlirFX application is installed on the smartphone to work with the camera, it is available for <a href="https://play.google.com/store%3Futm_source%3Demea_co%26utm_medium%3Dhasem%26utm_content%3DDec0915%26utm_campaign%3DGSearch%26pcampaignid%3DMKT-DR-emea-ru-mo-co-hasem-py-GSearch-Dec0915-299064978-GsMsBrAl_text_keywords_2">Android</a> and iOS.  Setup lasts a few minutes, not counting the half hour for initial charging.  You need to scan the QR code on the basis of the camera, give it a name, select a password, connect the gadget to Wi-Fi. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/525/c33/947/525c339477eb1925636251b2d8f50ca8.png" width="350"><br><br>  After that, on the smartphone screen, you can watch the image from the camera and select settings for recording.  After selecting a camera from the list, you can see the humidity level, temperature and charge of the device - to do this, click on the image.  The Rapid Recap buttons are available in the menu for generating a report and the intercom to communicate with the camera. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/109/9a8/6f5/1099a86f5ed366d2f659c0bd51dd5b3e.png" width="350"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/d89/89a/3a7/d8989a3a7ac21a259770c0ecd4d2f675.png" width="350"><br><br>  Humidity, temperature and motion sensors can be used to automatically turn on camera recording. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/5cb/99b/1b2/5cb99b1b22c814cdd8d1baf92f855f87.png" width="350"><br><br>  This is how the process of selecting zones for camera response looks like.  The technology is called SmartZone. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/e76/171/133/e76171133b44d0a24a2dd39f7f6f5817.png"><br><br>  The FlirFX camera is interesting because of the decent number of sensors and the ability to customize the response both in the range of temperature or humidity, and in the areas for movement.  You can use it for outdoor video surveillance or for the home - including as a video nurse.  Conveniently communicate using two-way communication.  Data is sent to the cloud or recorded on a microSD card, the camera can connect to the cloud via Wi-Fi or stream video directly to a smartphone. <br><br>  Of the minuses of the camera can be called the lack of complete accessories such as mounting for the car, street cover and waterproof casing.  Although completeness is enough for a home - you can either put it on the shelf or screw it to the wall. <br><br>  The price of the device is about 13,000 rubles. <br><br>  <strong>If you installed video surveillance at home, share in the comments what equipment you used.</strong> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/398757/">https://habr.com/ru/post/398757/</a></p>
