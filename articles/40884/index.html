The comments even went to such extravagant offers, how to limit the number of domains that can be legally purchased, well, that is, one domain in one hand, for example. <br><br>  Let me try to open this topic a little wider. <br>  Cybersquatting is not single.  It is necessary to divide this concept into parts. <br>  Interception of domains, trademark registration is one thing. <br><br>  How do you qualify the purchase of domains for future projects? <a name="habracut"></a>

      For example, I registered two domains yesterday.  Naturally, at least one domain will wait for its turn until the first project is launched.  There are projects that have been closed, but the domains continue to be paid for subsequent exploitation (I don‚Äôt want the beautiful, old domains, domains with pr to disappear). <br><br>  I am not a cyberxvotter, but it seems to me that the material blames me and anyone who has dozens, hundreds of domains, but who is not a cybersquatter, does not buy for the sole purpose of selling. <br><br>  I myself am faced with the problem of selecting domain names. <br>  I'm worried, it's hard to pick a domain, but you can.  Constantly convinced of this.  And examples of such domains as Yahoo, Google, Wikipedia, EBay (and not ebuy), Flickr, Craigslist (these are some of the largest projects on the network, and their domains do not have a serious semantic meaning) remove all fear from me.  No domain name problem.  There is a content issue.  If your project is significant, it will be popular on virtually any domain. <br><br>  Purchase of investment property.  This is bad? <br>  Suppose I bought a house and do not want to rent or sell it.  My houses or apartments just stand and are waiting for the buyer or my decision to create a business based on this real estate. <br>  Is this a bad deed? <br><br>  On the one hand, yes, I bought it, but I do not use it and do not rent it out to others.  In addition, by doing so, I am heating up the real estate market.  And on the other hand? <br><br>  You do not want to touch the right.  But the right to property is an inalienable right, here we are not talking about legislation, but about the inalienable human rights from birth. <br><br>  And who will regulate the amount of property in the hands of a person?  It is practically socialism then it will come out, a planned economy. <br><br>  Based on what you can not give to register domains? <br>  Humanly, starting from the free market and property rights. <br><br>  Based on the fact that the domain is not used? <br>  And if there is hanging overture feed?  Is it use?  I guess you say no. <br>  And if on the domain bank.com will be a resume of a bank employee? <br>  And if there is one page on a beautiful domain on a specific topic, but is it covered with google adsense advertising?  Is the owner worthy of this domain?  Nothing that page is commercial?  Or is it unworthy to make a profit for an honest person? <br><br>  Who has the right to decide what to buy with us and in what quantities if this product is legal? <br>  ICANN may have a monopoly  organizations. <br>  In the domain registration all are equal, the market is free.  Domain for all costs one price (+ - from your volumes and status).  Why can't a person invest his money in property and sell it?  He risks his money, he invests it, he puts work into the search for beautiful domains.  As well as people in search of good places to purchase investment real estate. <br><br>  So who will we entrust the right to restrict our freedoms and rights?  And on what grounds? </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/40884/">https://habr.com/ru/post/40884/</a></p>
