  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Vendekapets</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  The news slipped interesting information about the transition of companies to Windows 7. The statistics are not in favor of the latter.  60% refuse to switch to a new operating system <s>due to the crisis</s> due to lack of time and resources and fear of compatibility with software.  34% will make the transition, but only after a year, when the system passes the test of time. <br><br>  Vista was not much better.  Growth in sales of new Windows is gradually fading.  Microsoft has made itself a serious competitor in the face of Windows XP as the best solution for office work.  And the most paradox here, in the desire to oust XP from the market through its own costs.  And suddenly Google OS appears on the scene. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  I read your comments on Google OS, including not only on Habr√©, I saw how many people do not understand the seriousness of the situation.  Consider Google OS toy on toy netbooks.  Meanwhile, the mosaic from Google is gradually starting to take shape. <br><br>  First, if you think that you cannot burn a DVD-R disc through the browser, perform system diagnostics, edit or encode video without brakes, then you are mistaken.  On this account maturing project <a href="http://code.google.com/p/nativeclient/">Native Client</a> .

      Secondly, on the approach of Google Wave.  We will see how the software that seems familiar to us will be used in a new way: notebook, translator, thebat, icq and much more.  You will not believe, but even the admin panel of your blog will become unnecessary.  You will have a single control center for everything and everyone - Google Wave.  And photos and files can be simply dragged with the mouse into the browser and with the friends to write comments.  And how much it will bring relief to office workers, in terms of automating their activities, it‚Äôs not necessary to say. <br><br>  Google Wave does not need advertising, word of mouth will do its job.  The one who will not use new technologies will simply lose and remain behind.  However, for compatibility, gateways will be created, for example, smtp / pop3, icq, twitter and jabber. <br><br>  What does this mean?  And this means that all current desktop software will become morally obsolete - incompatible for work on your Internet.  Sharovarschiki will be pulled up and will let out the new software adapted for work in browsers.  And gradually the line between Windows and Google OS will be erased.  Software without complex adaptation will work on both systems.  Yes, and casual aside will not remain.  In JavaScript, now that just can not get up.  For example, here‚Äôs another thing from Google: <a href="http://code.google.com/intl/ru/events/io/sessions/AddingInteractive3DContent.html">code.google.com/intl/ru/events/io/sessions/AddingInteractive3DContent.html</a> <br><br>  I think these things will work best on Google OS.  Chrome and Firefox will support all the technologies needed by Google 100%.  At the expense of netbooks and laptops, they will receive the first army of users.  And when more software appears, armies of desktop systems will start joining them.  And it will not be a fad, with the new software it will be really more convenient to work and interact with people.  If we give an analogy, then this is about the transition from Dos to Windows 95. <br><br><img src="http://img269.imageshack.us/img269/6317/softwarewarsremasteredbr.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  But what about the "big games" - one of the important reasons for the popularity of Windows, people ask?  Here I am at a loss.  In this regard, Microsoft has Visual Studio, DirectX and a lot of groundwork from developers.  Whether they can oppose something to Google is unclear.  Perhaps now, somewhere there, the insidious plan is ripening in this direction.  And maybe they do not need it - others will do everything for them. <br><br>  "Big Games" are starting to spread through Valve's Steam systems.  The multiplayer is removed allowing only the official servers to play over the network, and for this you need to buy a key.  As an example, in this game, Blizzard takes steps with his Battle.net.  Trying to do services like Quake Live.  In general, igrodely begin to experiment.  And if you try to experiment, then before porting to Linux (read Google OS) is not far away.  Do not deny them the same cloud customers when they want to buy Starcraft III through Google OS?  And one day, going to Steam to buy Diablo IV, the system will determine the Google OS and give the game compatible with it. <br><br>  In 2-3 years, when today's 60% of refusers will think about where to go with Window XP or Vista, they will have a choice: Google OS or Windows.  In whose side will the choice be made, given that the software works there and there?  On Windows, a system that costs 300 bucks or a free Google OS?  As luck would have it, ReactOS and Wine are gradually coming up.  If Google will be beneficial to finally crush Windows, do you think it will not pour money into these good projects? <br><br>  My opinion of Windows, as a monopoly OS, is about 5-6 years.  Gradually, it will begin to crowd out Google OS from the market.  Naturally, complete crowding will not occur, a small percentage will remain.  In the post offices we still sit in Dos, if that.  But its impact on the market will be much smaller. <br><br>  Anonymous analysts with LOR </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/64333/">https://habr.com/ru/post/64333/</a></p>
