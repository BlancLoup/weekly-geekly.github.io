These moments of deep excitement, when the heart began to pound.  What caused this reaction? <br><br><h4>  All because of the fear of failure. </h4><br>  We are all familiar with this.  This obsessive voice within us, which makes us doubt everything we do, and finally stops us from making a risky, but life-changing decision.

      <i>But are failures as dangerous as we think?</i> <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h4>  Nothing succeeds like failure. </h4><br>  How do we learn to walk, catch a ball, ride a bike or write in words? <br><br>  We did not know at the level of instincts how to do all this.  We learned this, we learned from our mistakes.  Falling.  Passing through failures.  Again and again. <br><br>  Thank God that at that age no one evaluated or condemned us, because then we would sit quietly in a corner and did nothing our whole life. <br><br><h4>  Do not be afraid to stumble even more. </h4><br>  Wieden + Kennedy, one of the world's leading independent advertising agencies, has built its entire philosophy on failure. <br><br>  Company founder Dan Wieden recalls the day he was thrown out of work.  He was ashamed, he came home and talked to his wife.  And what she said to him changed his life forever. <br><br>  <i>"Nothing, you still have everything ahead."</i> <br><br>  Surprisingly, these simple words inspired him, gave him the right to make a mistake. <br><br><h4>  Relax, everything is fine. </h4><br>  What we all need to remember: to fail and fail is normal. <br><br>  The business idea was not successful?  This is normal, it happens. <br><br>  Failed in the exams at the institute?  And this happens.  Nothing wrong. <br><br>  Took off from work?  Yes, it's the best day in my life! <br><br>  If you dig deeper, you will realize that ‚Äúdefeat‚Äù is just an idea that we ourselves invented.  Then why let her stand in your way to success? <br><br><h4>  Congratulations on your failure! </h4><br>  Look at the failure in a new way: <br><br>  If it were not for the word "failure"?  What would we replace it with?  Result.  The results that we wanted to achieve, and those that we did not want.  Each result is another step towards our goals. <br><br>  Failure is, if you will, a kind of success in work.  Then congratulate yourself and do not be afraid to make mistakes and fail on the road to success. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/294384/">https://habr.com/ru/post/294384/</a></p>
