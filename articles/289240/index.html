We help diagnose when it is difficult, ‚Äùsays Andrei Afanasyev, founder of the iBinom startup.  The service works on the principle of finding a needle in a haystack. <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  The human genome consists of 3 billion pairs of nucleides - indivisible elements in the structure of DNA, representing a set of genetic "letters".  iBinom uses special software to find in the chains exactly the ‚Äúletter‚Äù in which the mutation occurred that caused the hereditary disease.  Such a reading of the DNA structure is called genome sequencing. <br><br>  Andrei Afanasyev argues that iBinom allows you to determine which particular substitution in the protein led to the mutation and whether it is pathogenic.

      The iBinom company was founded in 2013.  In addition to Afanasyev, the founders of the company are Valery Ilyinsky and Ignat Kolesnichenko.  The idea of ‚Äã‚Äãthe project was formed at the junction of biotechnology and Big Data. <br><br>  For the processing of big data, ready-made solutions were used, as well as a hand-written integration code. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/megamozg/post_images/64b/36f/9f3/64b36f9f3312226f80cb241c8f36f348.jpg" alt="image" width="200"><br><br>  <i>source: sun.inc.hse.ru</i> <br><br>  ‚ÄúThey took partly finished blocks ‚Äî software open, with university licenses, and partially developed a bundle themselves.  All this works in the cloud on Amazon Web Services, there is EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud) and S3 storage system (Simple Storage Service).  We built the pipeline, the sequence of the programs launched, ‚Äùsays Afanasyev. <br><br>  ‚ÄúIt's just as if you predicted the weather, looking not at the sky, but at 47 different sites on the Internet.  Different programs give different predictions, and then there is an algorithm that weighs these predictions and ultimately produces some kind of integrated assessment, ‚Äùexplains Mikhail Gelfand, a professor at the Faculty of Bioengineering and Bioinformatics at Moscow State University. <br><br>  Having prepared a business plan, the founders turned to the MSU business incubator.  In addition, the startup received investments of $ 22,000 from LETA Capital and AltaIR Capital venture funds, as well as from the management company of the business incubator Universe Ventures. <br><br>  iBinom is the only graduate of the MSU business incubator, in which the LETA Capital fund has invested again.  In October 2013, iBinom received another $ 100,000 from it. A further search for investors was delayed and lasted almost the entire 2014 year.  Only in December, the company finally received $ 300,000 from two Russian business angels. <br><br>  One of the advantages of iBinom is a higher speed of work with large amounts of data in comparison with competitors. <br><br>  The second advantage is the ability to upload to the cloud service an infinite number of analyzes that will be processed in a short time. <br><br>  The third advantage of iBinom is the ‚Äúpathogenicity‚Äù function, which more accurately determines the mutations not previously described. <br><br>  According to BCC Research, in 2012 the share of genome sequencing services on the world market was $ 3.5 billion. By 2018, it is forecast to grow to $ 11.7 billion. <br><br>  Andrei Afanasyev believes that iBinom in the future will be able to become part of any leading company in the field of cloud computing, or part of a large company that provides sequencing services. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/289240/">https://habr.com/ru/post/289240/</a></p>
