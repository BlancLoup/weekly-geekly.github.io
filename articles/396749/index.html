I want to talk a little bit today about how some people ‚Äúget‚Äù start-up capital for their own projects. <br><br>  This question is not very simple, but worries many.  I want to immediately note that the way to accumulate start-up capital is very thorny and complicated.  And not everyone can achieve this goal. <br><br>  When it comes to financing your own startup, many immediately think about attracting investment.  But in order to attract investment, the investor needs to give something tangible than just an idea and a presentation.  We need real developments, a pilot release, packs of documentation with an analysis of the project and a lot more.

      I will not talk about those lucky ones who are just lucky to get into the jet.  It is like winning a jackpot. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Let's better talk about how to make a certain model, according to which you can accumulate this initial capital.  So, the very first moment that needs to be understood and accepted is <b>time</b> .  Since we are not millionaires and not majors, we will need some time to accumulate finances. <br><br>  The next point is your real income.  If your salary is 1 thousand dollars, then it will be impossible to save up enough money to start your project.  From here comes the consequence: your work should be well paid, and your profession should be very popular. <br><br>  As a rule, employees have good incomes in the IT sector.  And already having a salary of several thousand dollars, you can start to postpone something for your project.  Moreover, an understanding of what needs to be saved for your project may not come immediately, but after some idea that you want to bring to life. <br><br>  Suppose that you already have a project idea, you have formed a certain concept and were able to set aside some money for the project.  Then there is another factor.  Factor <b>temptations</b> and <b>unforeseen expenses</b> .  Unforeseen expenses are certain major breakdowns in a house, car, health problems, etc. And the temptations are the desire to buy a newer car, go on vacation to the other end of the world, make repairs in an apartment, etc. And the first and the second will lead to an instant reset of your capital. <br><br>  In addition, the difficulties of the accumulation process are also connected with the fact that the monthly expenses for life are not linear and can increase, but the salary is a constant indicator, which, unfortunately, does not increase.  Plus, there are still risks of losing work, which will undoubtedly lead to wasting some amount of accumulated capital. <br><br>  And here I come to a very interesting point.  I will share not only my experience, but also the experience of many of my friends.  Just want to make a reservation that not everyone will be able or willing to do so.  Many people prefer stability, predictability and some confidence in the future.  And still need iron will, the ability to self-organization, and a certain spirit of adventurism. <br><br>  We all started in the companies, working for a salary.  We all imagined one picture of our future in our head, but in fact we received another one.  For many, this is a routine, lack of motivation, not an ambitious bosses, who do not need anything.  But, there comes a certain turning point when the specialist says to himself - that's enough.  And he understands that by jumping from company to company he is not able to realize his full potential, to get satisfaction from the work done, to realize all his ideas and ideas in life. <br><br>  And here, you need to change your psychology, and completely rethink your approach to work and your role in it.  And become the master of your own destiny.  If a specialist is very strong, if a specialist is eager to realize himself, then you need to do it yourself, and not wait when the company in which you work will see, appreciate and ‚Äúlift‚Äù you. <br><br>  And so, you all rethought and overestimated, and now you are determined to work for yourself.  What's next.  Now someone will think that I offer freelancing.  In no case.  Freelance - this is the same dead end of a career, as well as work for someone.  I suggest you find your corporate client!  And to offer him not himself, as an employee, but himself, as an independent expert.  In this case, you do not need to have your company, your staff, etc. As an expert in your field, you can help the company organize the process, hire staff, conduct analysis, and so on. <br><br>  And the beauty here is that you are paid the money you want.  So how do you help your client make a lot of money.  And the entire burden of responsibility will be on you.  If you can realize the ideas of the client, then you will be able to reveal your potential.  And your client will always work only with you.  This way you can accumulate your initial capital quickly and efficiently.  At the same time in your hands will be quite powerful resources. <br><br>  How to find these corporate clients.  It depends on a number of factors.  You must be sociable and sociable.  This is one of the highlights.  Never, I repeat, NEVER miss opportunities.  Always meet people from business, especially large ones.  Even if now you don‚Äôt need this acquaintance, meet all the same.  Take business cards, communicate with people, be interested in their business and aspirations.  Maintain friendly relations.  You tell about yourself and your work, about what you can do and create, about your aspirations. <br><br>  If you are a programmer, write free solutions and distribute them, if you are an analyst, write analytical articles and publish them on large resources, if you are a designer, then the whole Internet should know about your best work, etc. The fact is people from business who want to solve their real problems are not interested in your resume.  You will be judged by who you are already, as an accomplished person with real abilities to solve complex problems.  And your work on the Internet will tell about you much more than you do about yourself.  This is an important point.  Plus, do not forget, you are already selling not yourself as an employee, but selling the ability to solve the problem of your customer.  And these are different things.  Solve the problem of the customer, then for three months of work on the project you will earn more than your salary was for the year. <br><br>  It is often the case that a project ends or freezes.  Then you are left with a normal amount in your hands for your work, and with a car of free time, which you can already spend on your own project.  Plus, experience in a corporate client project will be invaluable in your own project. <br><br>  The first steps will be insanely difficult.  This is a fear of losing a job, not finding a client, fears that you will not be paid, and a lot more.  But as soon as you make your first project as an independent expert, you cannot be lured into the staff of any company for a salary already in life. <br><br>  And a few examples from life, how did you find your corporate clients?  As I searched.  I sent a lot of commercial offers to outsourcing companies.  I was contacted once and we tried on a small project.  I proved myself excellent in quality and time, and I was paid for the work without any problems.  Then I was recommended to another company, while putting a little of my interest on my rate.  These were the first steps.  Then it was already a little easier.  At some point, I began to abandon small and simple projects, and began to take only hardcore. <br><br>  My friend initially worked for a large outsourcing company, on a bid.  At some point, the client of this company decided to make a new project, but he no longer wanted to outsource, but his staff of specialists.  Then my friend suggested that he take him to his project as an independent expert who will help organize the entire work process.  Since the client already knew this person, he was hired, on his terms, as an independent specialist.  So began his career.  Only the money earned on the project he invested in the creation of his outsourcing company with a staff of its employees. <br><br>  My second friend was fond of cryptocurrency in his company.  But the leadership didn‚Äôt need it.  And at one point, he met the bank manager, who told him that the head of the bank had the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãfix with cryptocurrency.  As a result, my friend came into contact with the owner of the bank, who created for him a whole research and development department with decent funding. <br><br>  And the last example.  Another friend of mine was in the USA at a conference on IT technologies.  There he met an American who told him about the problems with endless spam on phones from annoying companies.  As a result, a very interesting startup was born that helps solve this problem.  My acquaintance told the American about his abilities and capabilities, and the American offered to create a company and fully finance the project. <br><br>  In the final, I want to say that, in my deep conviction, it is not possible to save money for my project, and to make the project too, without first trying to become an independent specialist and having experienced the self-sustained flight.  I saw many failed projects where funds were received from the investor.  And one of the reasons, I believe that the start-up does not understand the price of money, which he could not independently earn and save.  Therefore, not rationally spending them. <br><br>  All successes in their projects and successful accumulation of capital. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/396749/">https://habr.com/ru/post/396749/</a></p>
