  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Email marketing for startups</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"> <a href="https://sendpulse.com/"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/e3b/8b1/abb/e3b8b1abb0f041f5a97a2096840f6cf5.jpg"></a> <br>  We live in an era of technological breakthroughs and startups.  But who knows about the idea if it is not promoted?  As a rule, any startup founder in the process of creating a strategy for promoting his product focuses on content placement and social networks.  These marketing channels will not be costly, and therefore will be the most optimal for promotion in conditions of limited resources.  However, in order to increase the effectiveness of the selected communication channels, do not forget about email marketing. <br>  People use email daily.  That is why email marketing works.  According to research by consulting company McKinnsey &amp; Co, email marketing is 40 times more efficient than Facebook and Twitter combined in attracting customers. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  There are at least 3 reasons why a startup needs email marketing. <br><ol><li>  The number of email accounts and traffic received from them significantly exceeds the amount of social networks. <br>  Some interesting statistics: The network has 3 times more email addresses than Facebook and Twitter accounts.  <a href="https://blog.kissmetrics.com/email-crushes-social-media/">According to Kissmetrics</a> , all messages on social networks for the day make up only 0.2% of the volume of daily emails sent.  Moreover, when it comes to the contact list, the email base of subscribers belongs exclusively to you, but followers and fans belong to social networks.  In addition, email subscribers are a more loyal audience than social network users. </li><li>  Email messages imply subscriber response.  They are perceived as personal. <br>  There is a difference between receiving a personal message or some abstract post on social networks, which can flash in the tape as quickly as it appeared.  And if you really add personalization elements to email messages, then the conversion will be higher. </li><li>  Email newsletters promote cross-marketing. <br>  Many of us start the working day by viewing the received mail.  It's no secret that now letters are viewed not only on a PC, but also on mobile devices.  So you can attach a link to the letter to download a mobile application related to your startup.  And this is an additional channel of communication with the audience. </li></ol><br>  Email marketing has always been low cost and high conversion.  But in the SendPulse service, startups can get the opportunity to use email marketing opportunities absolutely free, regardless of the volume of mailing.  More information about our <a href="https://sendpulse.com/p/startups/">offer for startups</a> can be found on the site. <br><br>  <b>At what stages of email marketing development will a startup be useful?</b>  Consider the examples of mailing one of our supported startups - the project <a href="https://ecois.me/">Ecoisme</a> . <br><ul><li>  Forming a loyal audience.  Subscribers initially monitor the development of the project and take part as they can - fill out questionnaires, for example. </li></ul><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/846/192/769/8461927692c942c18556cdd91bd515d0.png"><br><ul><li>  Help in crowdfunding.  A vivid image explaining the product concept, personalization, clear text and a call-to-action button.  That's all that is needed for an effective startup mailing list. </li></ul><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/0f1/e4e/fd2/0f1e4efd20274e04aa41c8485e21d3c4.png"><br><ul><li>  Informing about development stages.  For the formation of loyalty, this stage is very important.  Subscribers need to understand what you have been doing all this time.  By the way, this stage can be combined with pre-sales of the product or holding special events (as in the example). </li></ul><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/e91/8cf/098/e918cf0989644ba9a1cde02167d10ed2.png"><br>  Recall that the purpose of <a href="https://ecois.me/">Ecoisme</a> is to create a complete home energy management system that connects through the shield to the cable and measures the level of electricity consumption by all devices in the house.  All energy consumption data is entered into a detailed statistical report to show excess consumption that can be saved. <br>  Now you no longer need to think about whether you forgot to turn off the iron before leaving for work.  The ecois system will send you a notification on the smartphone, which appliances are turned on and when it is better to run the wash in order to save electricity. <br><br>  But back to the other startups.  To cope with the tasks and goals with the help of email marketing, you should follow simple rules: <br><ul><li>  One letter - one accent.  Do not try to talk about all the events in your startup in one letter, otherwise the subscriber will not catch the point. </li><li>  Add various contacts to contact you.  Social networks, phone numbers, email addresses and Skype contacts ... Let the subscriber clarify details of interest in any convenient way. </li><li>  Write catchy topics.  This is the first rule of mailings for any business segment and any company.  After all, you have only 3 seconds to interest the subscriber to open a message. </li><li>  Create your style newsletters.  In this case, we are talking not only about the unique design of messages, but also about the manner of presenting the material, the style of the text, etc. </li><li>  Do not forget about the personalization of messages.  The more personal details you specify, the greater the chance to reach the subscriber. </li></ul><br>  Connect various channels of communication and use the maximum capacity to bring your idea to the world and bring your startup to a new level.  And we will help you with this and provide all the <a href="https://sendpulse.com/p/startups/">possibilities of email marketing absolutely free</a> . <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/0fd/fb5/0de/0fdfb50de3bf480da3172f090ba074e8.jpg">  Konstantin Makarov, CEO of <a href="https://sendpulse.com/">SendPulse</a> </div>
