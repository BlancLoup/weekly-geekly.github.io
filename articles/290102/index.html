  <section class="page js-page"><h1>What do we know about the video calls in Facebook Messenger</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Today it became known that Facebook still <a href="http://newsroom.fb.com/news/2015/04/introducing-video-calling-in-messenger/">announced</a> video calls in its Messenger application.  This can be written by the press service of the company, the news has already reprinted many media, it appeared here, on the Megamind.  Let us now pay attention to what remains behind the scenes and did not come into the view of IT-editions. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/1b9/8ff/dba/1b98ffdbada34b348c1ef60cdd738157.png" alt="image"><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  The news itself is that, following audio calls, Facebook launched the possibility of video calls.  You can start a conversation by simply clicking on the icon.  Everything works on VoIP, via LTE and Wi-Fi connections.  Available for users from Belgium, Canada, Croatia, Denmark, France, Greece, Ireland, Laos, Lithuania, Mexico, Nigeria, Norway, Oman, Poland, Portugal, UK, USA and Uruguay.

      Strictly speaking, the video on which everything is clear: <br><br><iframe src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://player.vimeo.com/video/125994315&amp;xid=17259,15700023,15700186,15700190,15700248,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhgUGtTjQB_OZkCoNFOXC_Ickuq1YQ" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0" title="Introducing Video Calling in Messenger" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  Now about the function itself, the description of which remains overboard.  Since video calls require high Internet speed, Facebook has made it smart - the messenger will switch between video and audio depending on the signal quality.  This, unlike Skype, will always stay in touch.  Moreover, the application distributes the signal between two people, and therefore, if one turns off the video, then the second one has better picture quality. <br><br>  Simply put, if you are sitting in your room, and your friend is climbing the mountains somewhere in Norway, then you can donate the view of your room, but you can let your friend show the beauty of nature. <br><br>  Stan Chudnovsky, product manager of Facebook Messenger, said that the team is now working on the option of group calls that would allow the application to compete with Google Hangouts. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/d71/10d/848/d7110d8484ee401a9d046455d1de3ec8.png" alt="image"><br><br>  When Chudnovsky was asked if Facebook was going to pay attention to the mobile streaming video market, as Meerkat and Periscope did, Stan replied: ‚ÄúWe are building the infrastructure that will allow us to do everything we want with the video.  Of course, we thought about it, but there are about 20 ways of development, and perhaps this is one of them. ‚Äù <br><br>  The biggest omission for video calls via Messenger is the inability to use it from the desktop, but Chudnovsky said that it will appear in the next updates, although the company believes that video calls by phone are more convenient because they do not tie the user to one particular place.  Recall that at the F8 conference, the browser version of the messenger was also presented. <br><br>  Chudnovsky said that if earlier one had to write in the messenger ‚ÄúHey!  Do you have a moment?  Let's talk on the video ", close the messenger and go to include the same Skype, now everything can be done directly in the application.  The company believes that it will allow to arrange spontaneous, unplanned video calls with experiences that are "here and now." <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/1b0/1d4/f90/1b01d4f90d7b4d8288ff6649ee3704ba.png" alt="image"><br><br>  The company also believes that Messenger will allow people to save money on phone calls.  As an example, he cites a couple when a girl is in Paris, and a guy is in New York.  Both use wi-fi and chat on Facebook.  The application will give a signal that they could translate chat into a video call, emphasizing that it is free.  And Messenger can give a signal when he sees that both interlocutors communicate in a chat and are connected to wi-fi.  It will work on the principle that now exists in Facebook, when video auto-play in the chronicle is available only when connected to Wi-Fi. <br><br>  When video calls will be possible in Russia are not yet reported, but Facebook promises to make the new feature available to everyone in the coming months. <br><br>  Sources: TechCrunch, Cnbc, Bgr.com, Facebook. <br><br>  Photo: Facebook <br><br>  Translation: <a href="http://rocketcallback.com/">Rocket Callback</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/290102/">https://habr.com/ru/post/290102/</a></p>
