  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Moving to Mac: Causes and Consequences</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"> Let's start from the beginning - why did I decide to switch to the Mac platform? <br>  Used Microsoft operating systems since the days of dos.  The list of used programs has long been honed, everything has become customary - there are thousands of programs, but I don‚Äôt want to install anything.  In general, as is often the case, I wanted to change, so to speak, new torments on my head.  It is always interesting to see how it lives there, in a parallel world.  Why exactly poppy?  Well, first of all, no matter how positively I treat the open source software, there are many programs that have rather mediocre counterparts in the Linux world.  At least the same set of Adobe programs is almost irreplaceable and you don‚Äôt need to talk about Gimp and so on - not this.  Therefore, it was necessary to choose from the fact that it could combine in itself some of the advantages of Unix systems and the advantages of a commercial platform. <br><br>  Secondly, yes, we are all victims of advertising - most of the switchers switched for this very reason.  You can assure yourself that this is an independent, independent decision based only on facts, but the facts - where are they?  The maximum of factual information that we can get in our Windows world is a five-minute mouse-drive in the store and a reading of technical specifications.  And what's next?  Only advertising, but fan cries on sites (about them a bit later).  And the fan shouts are mostly based on the same advertising. <a name="habracut"></a><br>  Next, arrange the design.  I, like many others, recently began to pay more attention to the type of technology - partly the impact of the same advertising, and partly the understanding that megahertz and megabytes are growing, but nothing really changes.  After realizing this, I want the technique to please at least the view, since there are not so many other innovations.  And here, the white MacBook just suits me perfectly, especially after the terrible FujitsuSiemens. <br>  So we went to the iron side of the issue.  In this aspect, the heat output system, which does not overlap, despite the surface of the laptop, was strongly attracted, since there are no openings at the bottom, as well as on the side.  Due to the special design, the air is drawn either up when the lid is open, or behind when it is closed.  The previous notebook was often overheated and it was frankly annoying, which is why this aspect is so important.  Further, the built-in camera, microphone, bluetooth, ir-port with a dual-core processor, an innovative touchpad and a small original price, makes its iron part in this price category quite competitive. <br>  And, finally, once they started talking about the price, the Russian pricing strongly discouraged the desire to purchase this device and I would have bought a Mac in at least a year, if not for one trading network that sold it to me almost at the American price (we can‚Äôt do without names, I write an advertising article).  But, it must be remembered that he would have at least an ideal iron component and price, without the certainty that you can work with him, I would never have taken it.  And here, the final argument, after the desire for something new, advertising, hardware and prices, was the transfer of Macs to the intel platform - it provides confidence that even if everything does not go as well as the fans describe, the system can be used . <br><br>  So, somewhat delaying the introduction, I became the owner of the MacBook'a.  The problem is that since I did it only now, a lot of its capabilities were transferred to the Windows world for a long time, so I didn‚Äôt experience any special wow effect.  Enough time has passed so that my view will not be clouded either by the joy of buying or by the difficulties encountered. <br>  Everyone praises expose and dashboard - I myself really liked to lay out the windows in the store and call widgets.  Only, having a closer look at the first, one can understand that this is an attempt to somehow save the window interface.  If we have a large number of windows, when expose is applied, especially if it is a small laptop screen, we see a lot of squares, the name of which can be seen only by moving the mouse to it, which does not contribute to quickly finding the required window, given that MacOS has windows separated from applications.  When minimized, only one of the application windows goes to the dock, if there are many windows, the strip becomes narrow and it will be easier to find the window in expose than in the dock.  At the same time, I remind you that minimized applications are not shown in expose.  Therefore, it seems to me folding in MacOS is not the most popular action.  It would be useful to apply any grouping, but it is not.  Therefore, most of the time, all windows are displayed on the desktop.  The situation saves, except that the ability to close the window of some applications while maintaining its performance.  Naturally, in general, this system provides quite tolerable window management, but it is much more convenient to call it much easier than a simple Windows / Linux system.  I liked, I do not remember who uttered the phrase about the fact that if the window systems in modern OS were very good, then no tabs in browsers would be needed. <br>  <strong>Dashboard is an</strong> excellent addition to the system and the most important thing in its popularity, if not strange - the way to call, the mouse button on the desktops or the active corners on the laptop.  All attempts to implement widgets in Windows stumbled precisely on the method of calling.  Minimize all windows in whist to get to the weather or take up part of the screen in Google Desktop discourage them from using them.  And I don't like keyboard combinations either - I use the keyboard as a last resort.

      <strong>Spotlight</strong> is something for which the creators of the OS can really be praised, as well as for the rest of the file search systems, like smart folders.  But, in Tiger, the search is not very fast and Google Desktop, which is on a Mac, which on Windows is ahead of it both in speed and in the number of items found.  However, they were pioneers in these technologies, and search in Leopard is improved. <br><br>  Fans love to shout about over-intuition and simplicity.  I agree in some ways, for example, the settings are rather tight, but they are very scarce - often you have to use third-party utilities or a terminal to change the system for yourself, which is not very convenient.  Otherwise, there are no differences from other modern wasps - it is intuitive, without the help of Google and communities, you can hardly do whatever you want.  Even such a trifle as showing the path to the file in the Finder - you intuitively click on the title, holding down the Command?  =) <br><br>  And since without help in any way, we proceed to discuss the communities.  The largest of them, if I'm not mistaken, is in LJ called <strong>ru_mac</strong> .  What can I say about the Russian-speaking Mac community?  In general, a very good community, even a thousand times repeated questions are answered without much irritation; you can meet people from completely different circles and countries.  But, unfortunately, it does not do without fanatics, and there are quite a lot of them, and it is they who discredit the entire community.  Often, any specified deficiency or problem with MacOS, they reduce your physical / mental deficiency by sending it ‚Äúto Windows‚Äù whenever possible (probably a curse is).  Naturally, if you want to get something new, at the same time you want to keep everything as before (yes, people are very strange), but you can always find a compromise, so go ‚Äúto Windows‚Äù yourself!  I just began to ignore such people and advise you - future switches. <br><br>  Is there a lot of poppy software?  Enough, although often there are not enough multifunctional programs that have been developed over the years, like WinRar or TotalCommander.  Archivers generally have to be assembled from two parts - archivers \ unarchators, and the most popular ones do not even know how to show what they unzip - simply, they throw everything into the folder without question!  <strong>Somehow Zipeg</strong> helps <strong>out</strong> - the development of a Russian programmer, but far from the power of WinRar.  As for the file manager, the <strong>Finder</strong> in many respects surpasses the Windows Explorer in terms of convenience, at least by two additional ways of displaying files, but also has drawbacks, in the form of why it is not clear simplifications.  All TotalCommander-like applications do not even come close to it in terms of convenience and functionality, I am silent about extensibility. <br>  All other programs completely satisfy my needs - Web-surfing \ mail \ music, video \ montage \ photoshop.  Of the applications that I would like to mention especially, this is Adium, Mailplane, iTunes and GarageBand. <br>  <strong>Adium</strong> is the best multi-system program I've ever seen.  Everything goes along with the program, it is easy to customize and customize (there are enough plug-ins for yourself right from the browser!) - no thousands of builds, conflicts, etc., which makes Miranda famous.  A very good program, and free. <br>  <strong>Mailplane</strong> is an online gmail interface, but in a separate program!  Allows you to easily add files, use multiple accounts and more. <br>  <strong>iTunes</strong> - I started using it even before the iPod was purchased, and I consider this program to be Apple‚Äôs main success.  In a sense, the mac was taken because iTunes doesn‚Äôt lag there - iPod dock for 30 thousand =) I won‚Äôt be too hard on this one ‚Äì‚Äì this program is fairly well known on both platforms. <br>  <strong>GarageBand</strong> is one of the best amateur programs for working with sound, considering that when you purchase a computer, it gets you ‚Äúfor free‚Äù. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/olpictures/fca/a2a/19b/fcaa2a19b7ec5869b53afc91b0720cd3.jpg" width="330" height="312" alt="Rainbow Screen of Death =)" hspace="10" vspace="10"><br>  How are things going with performance?  Nothing extraordinary - when running a browser with several dozens of tabs, iTunes, document editing software, Adium, and torrent client (the usual set of programs for me) on a MacBook 2.0 GHz 1 Gb, the performance is about the same level as in Windows Vista on the same system, especially considering that on Windows antivirus is still in the background.  Programs hang in the same way, the system ‚Äúcan‚Äù slow down, often the widgets do not get out very willingly, and the dock responds to the user's actions with a delay.  BSoD did not exist, but on the recent Windows it is not a frequent guest - in general, no surprises. <br><br>  Windows has to be started because of the specialized applications that are sometimes necessary, while I use <strong>VMWare</strong> for this.  Parallels turned out to be a terrible brake.  I think it is worth putting it under BootCamp, only a new hard disk will be purchased first. <br><br>  These are my feelings after switching from another operating system.  If I am satisfied with my purchase, it‚Äôs quite so, as I received a good laptop with an operating system that can be used daily.  But, I would advise everyone familiar to abruptly switch to mac?  I think not, considering how much I had to get around before I got what I wanted, but most do not know how to figure things out on their own.  They must indicate the full sequence of actions, and several times, and if all of this falls on me as the only one who understands this ... And simply asking the next question - what will it give them, what are the benefits?  I can not answer it - nothing will.  They already somehow understand one system and in vain spend time on achieving the same result, but on the other wasps - why? <br>  I, in general, is loyal to holivaras, for example, now I use both opera and firefox at the same time, while on the Internet there are fierce battles.  For myself, I concluded that I can work with any operating system and each has its advantages and disadvantages, but not one does not outweigh in any direction. <br><br>  In the meantime, poppy users can be either designers or victims of advertising, and advertising is a terrible thing. <br>  <a href="http://deleteone.blogspot.com/">DeleteOne</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/15426/">https://habr.com/ru/post/15426/</a></p>
