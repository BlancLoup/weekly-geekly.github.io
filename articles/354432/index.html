      When you try to constantly improve your skills, you are spoiled by success in life and work. <br><br>  Never stop learning, it's a matter of a lifetime.  Is always. <br><br>  Studies show that the benefits of learning are not limited to acquired skills. <br><br>  Do not allow the brain to be lazy and constantly experience it - perhaps this is the key to active life in old age. <br><br><blockquote>  <i>"Any skill you gain doubles your chances of success."</i> <i><br></i>  <i>- says Scott Adams</i> <br></blockquote><br>  <b>Begin to prepare for the future in advance, even if you have more urgent matters right now, and even if such efforts would seem to bring no clear benefit.</b> <br><br>  Every day, plant seeds that will allow you to lead an optimal and fullest possible life today and in the future. <br><br>  These valuable skills can radically improve your life.  At first glance it may seem that there is nothing supernatural in them, but you will just wonder how much they can affect your life and career now and during your active years. <br><br>  <b>Transferred to <a href="https://alconost.com/%3Futm_source%3Dhabrahabr%26utm_medium%3Darticle%26utm_campaign%3Dtranslation%26utm_content%3Dei">Alconost</a></b> <a name="habracut"></a><br><br><h2>  Become adamant </h2><br>  Non-addiction is the ability to stand up to challenges, to maintain diligence and interest, despite setbacks, vicissitudes, boredom and slippage on the way to the goal. <br><br>  Daniel Coyle, author of the book The <a href="https://amzn.to/2GetIiJ"><i>Little Book of Talent</i></a> , says that ‚ÄúIntegrity is such a mixture of enthusiasm, perseverance, and self-discipline that helps us move forward despite obstacles.‚Äù <br><br>  The only person who can really make you achieve something in life is yourself. <br><br>  Integrity is both a skill and a trait of character. <br><br>  And I want to make you happy: you can cultivate, moreover, you can cultivate in yourself inflexibility in order to strive for what is really important for you. <br><br>  This is a skill that can be learned and trained. <br><br>  Psychologist Angela Duckworth, author of the book <a href="https://amzn.to/2J2iYlm"><i>Integrity: The power of enthusiasm and perseverance</i></a> , believes that ‚Äúinflexibility‚Äù as a personal quality is a more important prerequisite for success than talent or intellect. <br><br>  Non-addiction is associated with perseverance, perseverance, ambition and attainment of achievement. <br><br>  Non-addiction is the ability to work long and hard to achieve a goal. <br><br>  You can develop the ability to intransigence. <br><br>  When you are faced with a challenge, it is more important how you respond to this situation, and not what obstacles you have to face. <br><br>  Ryan Holiday believes that "the barrier is the way."  And you will need steadfastness to overcome obstacles whenever you are in a challenge situation. <br><br>  The ability not to deviate from the chosen goal and go to it for a long time is an important indicator that allows you to judge whether you will achieve something worthwhile in life. <br><br>  Non-addiction is a surer companion of success than talent.  Regardless of how talented you think you are, talent needs to be put into work, otherwise it will not give you anything. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/719/7a2/98b/7197a298bd9e2dbdd65cae405b91dc13.png"><br>  <font color="#0096d6"><i>Photo by <a href="https://unsplash.com/photos/e0sIoZBS-go%3Futm_source%3Dunsplash%26utm_medium%3Dreferral%26utm_content%3DcreditCopyText">Alexander Ledogorov</a> from <a href="https://unsplash.com/%3Futm_source%3Dunsplash%26utm_medium%3Dreferral%26utm_content%3DcreditCopyText">Unsplash</a> website</i></font> <br><br><h2>  Adaptability has never been more important than it is now. </h2><br>  The structure of employment is changing, and more and more quickly. <br><br>  Max McCuyen, in his book <a href="https://amzn.to/2IYqHRm"><i>Adaptability: ‚ÄúThe Art of Winning in an Era of Uncertainty,</i> ‚Äù</a> states that ‚ÄúAny failure is an inability to adapt, any success is a successful adaptation.‚Äù <br><br>  We live in a constantly changing world, and these changes are unlikely to slow down. <br><br>  So, something very important yesterday (say, skill, knowledge, social circle, etc.) may not be worth a penny tomorrow. <br><br>  The ability to change (or change) to adapt to changing conditions is an essential skill that needs to be learned. <br><br><blockquote>  <i>‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not the strongest or the smartest who will survive, but those who are better able to adapt to change than others.‚Äù</i> <i><br></i>  <i>- Leon C. Megginson</i> <br></blockquote><br>  <b>Formerly, change was slow and progressive;</b>  <b>now they are swift, radical and unpredictable.</b> <br><br>  Charles Darwin said, "It is not the strongest and most intelligent species that survives, but one that has the maximum adaptive capacity." <br><br>  Adaptability helps us to survive in new circumstances and control the situation. <br><br>  Of course, this skill manifests itself best of all if it is accompanied by insight - the ability to take a fresh look at the situation before changes occur. <br><br>  The ability to grow depends on the ability to adapt. <br><br>  To maintain positions, most companies require people who can change over time. <br><br><h2>  Learn from failures to reach new heights. </h2><br>  Sounds weird, right? <br><br>  Anyone always looks for new (and fastest) paths to success, the best ways to learn, find out, ‚ÄúHow can you maximize in [x], bypassing [y]?‚Äù <br><br>  The first step is to stumble, but not to bother with failure as such, but to try to learn something from it. <br><br>  Nothing is perfect and will never be perfect. <br><br>  In all things you can learn.  Those who have mastered how to learn from mistakes achieve more. <br><br>  ‚ÄúAn evolutionary algorithm ‚Äî variability, selection, new iteration ‚Äî selects solutions in a world where the range of problems is constantly changing.  Different solutions are tested, and priority is given to those that actually work, ‚ÄùTim Harford points out in his book <i><a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1250007550/ref%3Das_li_qf_asin_il_tl%3Fie%3DUTF8%26tag%3D1201b-20%26creative%3D9325%26linkCode%3Das2%26creativeASIN%3D1250007550%26linkId%3D874846bb331a598f7f83a0b171bf9c2a">Adaptation: Why success always begins with failure.</a></i> <br><br>  Each mistake brings you one step closer to success if you can learn from mistakes.  The only vicious mistake is the inability to stand up and move on. <br><br>  Entrepreneurs know that failure is always more likely than success - and, nevertheless, they continue to risk their time and money. <br><br>  If you stumble, do not slow down and, most importantly, learn quickly. <br><br><h2>  How to learn, unlearn and relearn </h2><br><blockquote>  <i>"In the 21st century, the one who cannot read and write will be considered illiterate, but the one who cannot learn, unlearn and relearn."</i> <i><br></i>  <i>- said Alvin Toffler</i> <br></blockquote><br>  Flexible learning rules the ball. <br><br>  Learning to unlearn is new learning. <br><br>  The ability to adjust career in advance is the most important factor determining where you will find yourself in five years. <br><br>  <b>Today, to succeed, it is necessary to constantly adapt - forget the old "rules" and learn new ones.</b> <br><br>  To do this, you need to constantly check the strength of your ideas about how the world works, be able to doubt the old paradigms and be able to ‚Äúretrain‚Äù what will become important in your profession, industry, career and life. <br><br>  Finding opportunities in a changing environment can those who are constantly seeking them. <br><br>  You start a real education with the beginning of a career that requires you to constantly learn, no matter how often you have to unlearn and relearn. <br><br><h2>  How actively and skillfully to conceptualize, apply, analyze and synthesize information </h2><br>  The ability to actively and skillfully conceptualize, apply, analyze, synthesize and / or evaluate information collected (or generated) from observations, through experience, during reflection or communication ‚Äî is invaluable at work. <br><br>  Francis Bacon once said: "Critical thinking is the desire to seek, patience to doubt, love of reflection, slowness in arguments, willingness to weigh, thoroughness in screening and complete order, as well as intolerance to any fraud." <br><br>  The ability to make decisions and cope with the tasks is based on collecting reliable information, evaluating information for different solutions and choosing the optimal solution depending on the available criteria and on the situation. <br><br>  A person who is able to see a problem from an unusual angle sometimes solves it in a completely unexpected and often elegant way. <br><br>  At the same time, such people help to understand how narrowly we see this problem, and whether there is a problem in this situation as such. <br><br>  People with creative thinking are prone to innovation and ingenuity, and it is they who often manage to find new ways to do this or that, enrich the working environment, and increase the efficiency of systems and processes. <br><br><h2>  Ability to self-control, ability to control others and the situation in which you find yourself </h2><br>  In a practical sense, we have two minds: thinking and feeling.  People with high emotional intelligence (EI) are distinguished by responsiveness, empathy, ability to listen and the ability to self-analyze. <br><br>  They also excel in interpersonal contact. <br><br>  Emotional intelligence is valued very highly, and it is not surprising.  Without it, nothing works. <br><br>  The author of the book <a href="http://amzn.to/2FHUlZq"><i>Emotional Intelligence: Why he is more important than IQ</i></a> Daniel Goleman writes: ‚ÄúPeople with well-developed emotional skills more often lead others to a full and fruitful life because they know how to master those facets of mind that help a person to be more productive;  people who are unable to bring order to their emotional life constantly struggle with themselves, which prevents them from concentrating on work and thinking clearly. ‚Äù <br><br>  Social skills are very important today, and in the future the need for them will not diminish at all. <br><br>  Emotional intelligence helps us to establish contacts with others, to calculate the motives of other people and to predict their reactions. <br><br>  Any discipline in which emotional intelligence is useful (a resource inherent only in people) in the future will be in high demand. <br><br>  If you do not know how to be the soul of a company, it is never too late to learn this.  Practice communicating with others.  In the future, social skills will be needed for prosperity. <br><br>  <b>About the translator</b> <br><br>  The article is translated in Alconost. <br><br>  Alconost is engaged in the <a href="https://alconost.com/services/game-localization%3Futm_source%3Dhabrahabr%26utm_medium%3Darticle%26utm_campaign%3Dtranslation%26utm_content%3Dei">localization of games</a> , <a href="https://alconost.com/services/software-localization%3Futm_source%3Dhabrahabr%26utm_medium%3Darticle%26utm_campaign%3Dtranslation%26utm_content%3Dei">applications and sites</a> in 68 languages.
