  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Accelerate with Gears</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  What is Gears? <br><br>  If you don‚Äôt go deep into details, this is a program that downloads static site files to your computer, for example, icons, design pictures, JS scripts or styles.  As a rule, this significantly increases the speed of work with the site.  It also allows you to work with an online application that is essentially offline, the main thing is to have at least a short-term access to the web. <br><br>  A vivid example of this is the admin engine of the blog engine - WordPress, version 2.6. 
      <br>
        <script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>
        <ins class="adsbygoogle"
          style="display:block; text-align:center;"
          data-ad-layout="in-article"
          data-ad-format="fluid"
          data-ad-client="ca-pub-6974184241884155"
          data-ad-slot="8945601208"></ins>
        <script>
          (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
        </script>
      <br>
      There will be no pieces of code, with detailed tutorials, just some general information.  I dug up this information both on the official website of Gears and on the Russian Internet, <a href="http://absolvo.ru/">I</a> was interested, so I decided to share it with you. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Install this program (or rather, add-on to the browser) is easy, just go to the official <a href="http://gears.google.com/">page</a> . <br>  Here are the system requirements: <br><br>  <strong>Windows</strong> <br>  Windows XP / Vista -&gt; Firefox 1.5+ and Internet Explorer 6.0+ <br><br>  <strong>Windows mobile</strong> <br>  Windows Mobile 5+ -&gt; Internet Explorer Mobile 4.01+ <br><br>  <strong>Mac</strong> <br>  Mac OS X 10.4+ -&gt; Firefox 1.5+ and Safari 3+ (I could not install Gears under windows vista, maybe temporary difficulties?) <br><br>  <strong>Linux</strong> <br>  Linux -&gt; Firefox 1.5+ <br>  <strong>32-bit OS (64-bit not supported)</strong> <br><br>  As you can see - Opera, unfortunately, goes to the forest.  But this, I believe, is a temporary phenomenon.  Exactly like this - that sites that are already ready to work with this technology - once and twice.  One of the first who decided to fix this is the WordPress development team. <br><br>  As promised - I will give some statistics on WP. <br><br>  I didn‚Äôt want to start using this technology for a long time, but I decided to try at work, where the Internet connection speed does not exceed 250K.  As a result, the loaded WP admin panel began to fly very quickly.  All scripts, all icons and styles are loaded instantly.  And this is not a joke, really  momentarily, only content is loaded.  Sorry for the face of the blog does not apply. <br><br>  Now this is not so much an admin as an application that hangs in my separate label, and is loaded instantly. <br><br>  Naturally, you now ask how this differs from the usual browser cache.  The main difference is that Gears ___ statics of the site, and you work quickly and without brakes, when the browser thinks about some icon on a godforsaken page. <br><br>  By itself, Gears even more ruins the border that lies between the online application and offline.  Moreover, with the development of technology and its spread, it can destroy it completely. <br><br>  A person can sit and work all day in full analogue of Excel, not even suspecting that he works with Google Docs.  Already, some browsers allow you to create application shortcuts, in fact, opening a browser window without any identifying marks.  Just a window with the interface that the programmer wrote and invented the designer. <br><br>  And now you can work with such "labels" using Gears.  It is phenomenally fast and very convenient.  Even with short-term problems with the Internet. <br><br>  I also installed Gears on IEm on my PDA - I really don‚Äôt like it, but the speed of working with a blog is more than through mini Opera. <br><br>  The technology is multifaceted, it allows you not only to keep statics on your hard disk, but also to work with the site in several streams.  Saving statics on the locale is rather a prelude, a nice bonus to the main features. <br><br>  A striking example of this is YouTube.  With Gears installed, you have the opportunity to choose an unlimited number of files to download, and go to sleep - in the morning everything will be on YT servers, isn‚Äôt it convenient? <br><br>  Moreover, the relatively recent versions of the API for Google Gears allow (so far, unfortunately in the US) using cellular networks or public WiFi, you can find yourself on the planet, find restaurants that are nearby, or see which parks are nearby.  And while GPS is absolutely not needed. <br><br>  Briefly, what Gears is is a technology that allows you to create unique (if not impossible, who knows), until now, web applications, providing tremendous speed and convenience to the end user. <br><br>  The user may have an unstable communication channel - however this is not a hindrance.  As they shouted at some forum - Dialapschiki - rejoice! <br><br>  Data, over time, can become a lot - also not a hindrance, SQLite acts as a repository.  You need to change the car, for example because of the breakdown of the old laptop - just install Gears and copy the database from the catalog to the catalog. <br><br>  However, now it is impossible to rely too much on this technology - it is rather raw, and it will be filed more than once. <br><br>  PS - and here <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/google/38391/">there is</a> even a piece of code.  With Russian comments. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/38983/">https://habr.com/ru/post/38983/</a></p>
