For reference: since 2008, this brand has been producing headphones and computer peripherals, accessories for Apple devices, accessories for TV. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/512/435/132/5124351325063010ffeb22423680f4fd.jpg"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  So, the first <b>Denn DOM720BS</b> mouse is part of the Black Fox line, which includes the company's premium solutions.  The main feature of the model is design.  The mouse has an unusual graceful (slim) shape and does not exceed 2-3 centimeters in height.  I note that the design of the device is symmetrical, so the mouse can be used both right-handed and left-handed. <br>  Denn DOM720BS is almost completely made of black glossy plastic.  It looks beautiful, but I would recommend immediately taking and hygiene products to the device to get rid of fingerprints from time to time.  On the edges of the DOM720BS there are rubberized inserts, thanks to which the mouse is fixed in the hand. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/a23/6cd/cfa/a236cdcfaa5a9a9e8a423d8114ec10c8.jpg"><br><br>  In general, when working with Denn DOM720BS, it seems that you are driving your hand on the table.  In addition, the mouse is almost weightless.  Such ease would probably appreciate the girls.  For brutal men, the manufacturer has foreseen the possibility of weighting the device.  If desired, you can remove the top cover and install 1 or 2 AAA batteries. <br>  In the work of Denn DOM720BS proved to be good.  I must warn that the 1.5-meter cable is not suitable for everyone to use with a laptop.  This model is also presented in the wireless version - see the DMC920 line.

      The second mouse - <b>Denn DMC910GP</b> - is the exact opposite of the Denn DOM720BS model.  Unlike the "tail of a relative," this representative of the Black Fox series is completely made of matte plastic.  Such a surface is a kind of guarantee of a permanent ‚Äúpresentation‚Äù, even if you have to eat at the computer ÔÅä Denn DMC910GP can be called more practical than Denn DOM720BS. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/511/e5a/d29/511e5ad29c0e0bb2a96e005d35eedbd1.jpg"><br><br>  In addition, if DOM720BS seems to be flat, then DMC910GP, on the contrary, has a convex rounded shape.  As a result, it looks very unusual, and is more suitable for working with a laptop. <br>  And now the main thing: Denn DMC910GP is a wireless mouse, but one of the simplest in terms of its capabilities.  The mouse has only three buttons (right, left and wheel).  In my opinion, this is a classic, the most necessary minimum, especially given the fact that, if necessary, you can change the resolution of the optical sensor.  The mouse has four modes: 500 dpi, 1000 dpi, 1500 dpi and 1750 dpi, to switch between which you need to hold down the right and left buttons for three seconds. <br><br>  To power the mouse, one AAA finger-type battery is used, which should be installed in the corresponding compartment covered with a lid. <br><br>  Denn DMC910GP is able to work from one battery or battery up to three months.  The switch is located next to the optical sensor, but thanks to the auto-sleep function, it can be turned off automatically so as not to waste energy. <br>  If you believe the description on the box, the Denn DMC910GP can work up to 10 meters from the computer, that is, from the transceiver with a frequency of 2.4 GHz.  I don‚Äôt know if the manufacturer slandered when talking about the maximum range of work, but at a distance of 5 meters from the computer the mouse accurately copes with its duties. <br><br>  The third Denn mouse - <b>Black Fox DOM710GO</b> - is an almost exact copy of the DMC910GP.  Exactly the same compartment for a single AAA battery, which can be installed if the weight of the 710th seems insufficient. <br>  As you probably understand, Black Fox DOM710GO does not need its own food, because it is a wired mouse.  Another difference from the DMC910 lies in the resolution of the sensor, which is fixed at around 1000 dpi. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/64c/ba0/668/64cba0668c2ce241b096be35576d7b58.jpg"><br><br>  The fourth mouse - <b>Denn Black Fox DMC447</b> , perhaps the most interesting of all considered.  By design, it is similar to the DOM720, and even exceeds DMC910 in functionality. <br>  Just like the previously reviewed DOM720, the DMC447 is fairly flat. <br>  The upper part of the body is made of black glossy plastic, which, of course, gives the mouse some refinement, but not very practical. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/c29/bd2/5af/c29bd25af506d2fb1ef552a2df71bd2a.jpg"><br><br>  The mouse has a symmetrical shape, so it is suitable for both right-handed and left-handed people. <br>  The mouse has only two buttons.  The classic wheel is missing.  Instead, Black Fox DMC447 has a touch strip, which is very useful and performs up to 6 functions: you can flip through pages, show and hide the desktop, scroll up / down pages, move the page sideways, up / down, diagonally. <br>  On the bottom of the mouse, you can find a large compartment for a pair of AAA finger-type batteries and a miniature USB dongle.  Fortunately, this compartment is covered with a good lid, and not a piece of cheap plastic, so there are no problems with installing batteries. <br><br>  Note that the switch has three positions: off, Win and Mac.  That is, the mouse is not only compatible with Windows, but also with MacOS, which means it can use some of the special features of these operating systems. <br>  Next to the switch is an optical sensor with a fixed resolution of 1200 dpi. <br>  I also note that the three previous Denn mice have four Teflon legs, which are glued at the corners of their bases. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/edb/92f/1d7/edb92f1d75d28dea7cbbdead96003739.jpg"><br><br>  In Denn DMC447, instead of four legs, there are two wide strips, which seem to be part of the body, and not glued to the sticky mass. <br><br>  With regard to the use of Black Fox DMC447, then during the testing I did not come to some definite conclusion.  Mechanical buttons had a rather harsh move, which, however, does not cause discomfort.  But you need to get used to the scroll bar in place of the wheel - at first you willy-nilly miss and you hit the buttons. <br>  Blue Ray technology, which is involved in the Black Fox DMC447 model, should allow it to work correctly on any surface, including fur, glossy surface, and fabric.  Testing has confirmed this by 100%; it was simply not possible to find the surface unsuitable for this mouse. <br><br>  In general, personally I, from all four mice would give preference to Denn Black Fox DMC447.  It is characterized by the most successful design, ergonomics, practicality, and most importantly - technical characteristics and the ability to work on different surfaces.  Nevertheless, it should be noted that fans of unusual design are more likely to be attracted by the Denn Black Fox DOM710 / DMC910, as well as the DOM720 / DMC920 and DMC930. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/161113/">https://habr.com/ru/post/161113/</a></p>
