I'll tell you what will be discussed. <br><br><h2>  What is pasteorga? </h2><br>  For some time (when I didn‚Äôt remember exactly), I began to use certain services, the essence of which is the temporary (or not) hosting of pieces of code.  In practice, it looks like this: I want to show Vasya Pupkin my procedure (advice to ask, or something else), in ICQ, this can be done, but it will be unreadable, and it is inconvenient to edit this code in ICQ.  For that and services - came in, inserted the code, received the link, gave the link to Vasya.  Under the link there will be a code highlighted with.  Conveniently.  They are called unknown, but there is a tendency (like jeep and SUVs, or pampers and diapers :) to call them ‚Äúpasteorgs‚Äù (paste.org) or ‚Äúpastebins‚Äù (paste.bin).  I will call Pasteorgi for used. <br>  So, not so long ago, I decided to make my own such service.  There were several reasons - this is the presence of free hosting with a large amount of space, the desire to ‚Äúpump‚Äù their skills, and an attempt to do something more convenient than their counterparts. <br><br>  It began with the fact that I began to be interested in friends, what minuses they see in those services that they use. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h3>  Short review </h3><br><ul><li>  <a href="http://paste.org.ru/">paste.org.ru</a> <br>  I will quote: <br>  ‚ÄúDisadvantages: the‚Äú inserted ‚Äùfield must have a monospaced font. <br>  The choice of the way of illumination is terrible - the layout of languages ‚Äã‚Äãis horrible, to find the necessary language in that drop-down list is unrealistic. ‚Äù <br>  So from the minuses I can select the choice of language.  Monospaced font seems to me not very critical minus. <br>  Of the advantages, there is nothing special to note - a fairly ordinary resource, I did not see anything special about it. </li><li>  <a href="http://everfall.com/paste">everfall.com/paste</a> <br>  This is the resource that I used for some time.  First, there is a version history.  Those.  opening someone's code, I can insert a new version of this code.  This includes a good backlight (GeSHi), and several options, such as "prohibit editing" (read the insertion of a new version), the storage period of the code.  Of the minuses, he noted the still inconvenient choice of languages ‚Äã‚Äãin the combo box, the stupidly made version history (that is, when viewing the code and having a large number of versions thereof - it will be scary - try it yourself :). </li><li>  <a href="http://codepad.org/">codepad.org</a> <br>  It's pretty simple here.  From the pros, I liked the choice of languages ‚Äã‚Äã(but due to the fact that the list of languages ‚Äã‚Äãin the form of radio buttons is not enough), the built-in code interpreter.  The rest is not very, even the author can not be specified. </li></ul><br>  The rest of the services that I saw are nothing special - the same eggs, only in profile. <br>  From all this, we can distinguish as a result a few points that should be taken into account when developing such a service to improve usability.

    <h2>  What should be comfortable? </h2><ul><li>  Convenient selection of languages. <br>  The results of discussions resulted in a decision, in the form of a ranking of languages.  I created a table in the database - a list of languages ‚Äã‚Äãand made a field for language rating there.  The more code inserts in the X language, the higher the rating of this language.  As a result, the 10 languages ‚Äã‚Äãwith the highest rating fall into the radio buttons, there is also the ‚ÄúOther‚Äù item, by choosing which one can choose the language from the combo box.  The plans are to record the individual language rating in each user's cookies.  This will make it possible to make Pasteorg more convenient for each individual user.  The idea of ‚Äã‚Äãdisplaying the list of languages ‚Äã‚Äãin the form of a cloud was also expressed - quite interesting, but for the time being we are discussing. </li><li>  Version history, well implemented. <br>  Here we discussed less.  The inconvenience that was in Pasteorg # 2 is with a large number of versions, they occupy the entire screen, and the code turns out to not understand where.  Although the code is the main and priority element of the page.  So we just turned down the default version history blog.  When you click on it - unfolds.  In addition, two such blocks were made - above and below with respect to the code field, this can be convenient, with a large size of the latter.  By the way, plans to analyze this size, and if it fits on the page, remove the block from the bottom. </li><li>  Ability to "customize" the storage of your code. <br>  It can be said, whistles perdelki.  Specify the author, prohibit editing, code storage period - all this has been implemented.  The idea was also made to make the possibility of ‚Äúpasswording‚Äù the code, which we also implemented. </li></ul><br>  You can try the service: <a href="http://code.shareservices.net/">code.shareservices.net</a> <br>  And not only to try, but to use already (of course, everything was done for free, and without any advertisements). <br><br><h2>  And finally ... </h2><br>  Now we are developing plugins for popular IDEs.  For Visual Studio is almost done.  In fact, the number of actions when using such plug-ins is significantly reduced. <br>  There are still many interesting and useful features for the service.  So, if anyone was interested, and if someone wants to participate in the project - we are all for it. <br>  Moral: ‚ÄúProgrammer - give a normal interface!‚Äù (C) some anonymus) <br><br>  PS Although it is clear that the programmer should not make the interfaces, but in practice for some reason everything is different. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/80670/">https://habr.com/ru/post/80670/</a></p>
