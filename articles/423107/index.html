Let us discuss the metrics of the live service. <br><br><h4>  11:40 - 12:10 - “The experience of moving parts of a bank site from Parser to Go”, Andrey Ratserov, Alfa-Bank </h4><br>  The story will be devoted to our experience sawing monolith in a little-known language.  I will tell you why the choice fell on Go, although other languages ​​were involved in the project, how we changed our view of our services, what errors we encountered in the process, and why our small team is good with Go. <br><br><h4>  12:10 - 12:40 - “Media server broadcasts on Go”, Mikhail Raichenko, VKontakte </h4><br>  How we made our own media server on Go, where we won, where we lost, how we integrated with the infrastructure.

On the example of Lazada and Ozon.travel companies ”, Yuri Vasiyarov, Ozon.travel </h4><br>  I will try to compare Go processes in two companies with completely different technological stacks (PHP and .NET).  I will try to make the report balanced in order to equally highlight the technical and organizational side of the issue.  What will not be in this report: a story about how Go is a wonderful language.  I suppose everyone present knows this anyway. <br><br><h4>  14:00 - 14:30 - “How we started using Go in Responsults @ Mail. Ru”, Mark Belotsky, Mail.Ru Group </h4><br>  I'll tell you how we transferred the functionality of Responses from Perl to Go.  I will share the joys and pains of the transition to this language, and especially how to make friends with the old pearl barley project with the new gosh.  Let me explain why we like Go and why we don’t regret switching to it. <br><br><h4>  14:30 - 15:00 - “The experience of Avito transition. Deliveries from Java to Go”, Ilya Lapin, Sergey Polyakov, Avito </h4><br>  You will learn how we rewrote the microservice project from Java to Go, what difficulties we encountered, what advantages we could see and what happened to us after that. <br><br>  15:00 - 15:20 - Coffee break <br><br><h4>  15:20 - 15:50 - “Pipeline Search by Mail.
