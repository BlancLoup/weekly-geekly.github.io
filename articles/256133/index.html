      Interestingly, 72% of all pre-orders were made by those who in the past 2 years bought at least one other Apple device.  28% of buyers, for whom Apple Watch became the first device from Apple, is also a very good result! <br><br>  40% chose watches in aluminum and black, and 34% chose a stainless steel version.  23% of buyers preferred watches in silver aluminum case, 3% in black design from stainless steel. <br><br>  Recall that the prices for the Apple Watch Sport start at $ 349, the "regular" Apple Watch is priced at $ 549, and the Apple Watch Edition with a gold case cost from $ 17,000. <br><br>  The first buyers will get their watches for earlier the end of May, but already now many developers are ready to launch their products on the new device!  Uber, Twitter, Evernote.  Tripadvisor, Wunderlist and others have already made their applications, sent them to the AppStore and are waiting for the release of the apple clock. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br><h3>  AppAnnie Report on the first quarter of 2015 </h3><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/efe/55e/679/efe55e679ad84ae58d95f333f32ffa76.jpg"><br><br>  AppAnnie published a traditional <a href="http://ru.blog.appannie.com/app-annie-index-market-q1-2015/">report</a> on the mobile application market in the first quarter of 2015.  And we, by tradition, prepared for you a list of the most interesting of the report: <br><br><ul><li>  Application downloads on Google Play are 70% more than in the AppStore.  A year earlier, this value was at 60%.  The main increase in downloads is primarily due to the large growth of Mexico, Turkey, Brazil and Indonesia.  But at the same time, the AppStore remains the leader in revenue and is ahead of Google Play by the same 70%. </li><li>  In the first quarter of this year, China overtook the USA in iOS application downloads.  This is due to the late launch of the iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus.  The main growth drivers are games and photo / video applications.  At the same time, the US remained the leader in terms of income. </li><li>  Mexico showed unprecedented growth and overtook South Korea in downloads.  Now Mexico is in 5th place in this ranking.  Brazil and India remained in their places and ranked second and third. </li></ul><br><br><h3>  European Commission v. Google </h3><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/563/fa1/1a7/563fa11a7dd24a999d5e4b91fc37de4d.jpg"><br><br>  European Competition Commissioner Margaret Vestager (Margrethe Vestager) officially <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-04-15/eu-accuses-google-of-antitrust-violations-starts-android-probe">announced</a> on April 15 that Google is accused of violating antitrust laws. <br><br>  The company is accused of allegedly forcing the manufacturers of smartphones to pre-install their own applications on the devices, and also demanded that they stop using any versions of their Android OS other than the official one. <br><br>  Google denies all the allegations, and <a href="http://googlepolicyeurope.blogspot.be/2015/04/android-has-helped-create-more-choice.html">argue</a> that such interaction with the manufacturers' companies occurred voluntarily and there was no pressure from them. <br><br>  One of the witnesses in the case was Yandex.  The Russian company said that Google demanded that manufacturers' companies refuse to install Yandex applications in favor of their own. <br><br>  The case of the European Commission against Google has been ongoing for 5 years.  Google is threatened with a $ 6 billion fine. <br><br><br><h3>  New Tapjoy Report </h3><br>  It is no secret that IAP (in-app purchases) work better if they become a habit for players.  This idea was expressed in figures by Tapjoy in its <a href="http://go.tapjoy.com/mobile-signals-report">report</a> .  The report includes data obtained for 479 applications used by users from October 2013 to December 2014 in the Pacific. <br><br>  Tapjoy calls the number 3 magic for IAP monetization. According to them, if the players make at least 3 internal purchases, then the application will reach $ 1 million in revenue. 3 or more purchases. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/5db/521/9b6/5db5219b6a9d431ab0e740ce74d3a6b5.png"><br><br>  Here are some more interesting facts from this report: <br><br><ul><li>  The 10 most profitable games have a game session duration of more than 25 minutes. </li><li>  On the first day of the month, most domestic purchases are made. </li><li>  In more than 50% of games, the most popular item is sold 20 times more often than the least popular. </li></ul><br><br><br><h3>  Smartphones help predict earthquake </h3><br>  Modern smartphones have quite impressive capabilities in terms of computational power and sensors, the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãusing all this power has long stirred minds.  <a href="http://advances.sciencemag.org/content/1/3/e1500036">Here</a> is one of the first real-world applications of private smartphones. <br><br>  Accelerometer, GPS and Internet access - this is enough to track the seismic activity of the earth.  The only question is how to filter the multiple noise from normal use, but apparently it turned out. <br><br>  The Japanese earthquake of 2011 was recorded 1 minute before the devastating shocks.  A minute is of course very little, but remember that this is only the beginning and that earthquakes do not know how to predict at all.  However, one minute can save many lives. <br><br><br>  ************************************************** ************************************************** ***************************************** <br>  If you liked the material and you had time to evaluate the professionalism of the authors of this blog - there is an opportunity to join them.
