Kindle 6, Kindle 5 and Kindle Paperwhite</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  In mid-September, Amazon introduced two new readers - the ‚Äúbase‚Äù Kindle and the ‚Äúelite‚Äù Kindle Voyage.  Home sales of the first of them began on October 2, the older model starts only the 21st.  And if the standard Kindle has already reached our region, then the Kindle Voyage (judging by the pre-order rush) will not do it very soon.  In anticipation of the best "reader" from Amazon, let's try to figure out what the usual Kindle of 2014 is like and compare it to Kindle 5 (2012) and Kindle Paperwhite. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/e12/75d/d2d/e1275dd2dcdb4852a20a19a2b634e3ad.jpg"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  <i>This is the seventh generation of readers from Amazon, but due to the fact that last year the basic "reader" was not updated, this year's model, apparently, should be called Kindle 6. (It is possible that there will be confusion: someone will call the ‚ÄúKindle book‚Äù 7).</i>

    <h4>  PACKAGE and appearance. </h4><br>  The new Kindle comes in a box that is slightly different in length and width from the parameters of the reader itself.  There is an external sliding box and the box itself, opening which, besides the book itself in cellophane, we will find another cable to the computer and a very subtle user guide.  However, this is not the first year that we see such a complete set - no wonder. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/b69/3ca/042/b693ca04206846549f25877d528718dd.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/ee9/e08/f5b/ee9e08f5b5c6425c8dc3e46c1514f8bb.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/d43/ff4/a5a/d43ff4a5a0b247a88b930c72b3f8e10c.jpg"><br><br>  Outwardly, the new Kindle is very similar to the Paperwhite version: the truth is, if you look closely, there are differences.  The back side is now flat with bevels around the edges, and not rounded off gradually (as in the backlit version).  The case is made of plastic, which is why, in our opinion, tactile sensations have suffered (if we talk about using the "reading room" without a cover).  The book is a millimeter thicker, but also 25 grams lighter than Paperwhite, so the hand is not so weighty, but rather ‚Äúairy.‚Äù  Subjectively, all of these changes had no effect on usability. <br><br>  The ‚Äúon paper‚Äù model of 2014 is more cumbersome than the Kindle 5 (note that the dimensions are exactly the same as the Kindle Touch), but with a real comparison, the difference is almost insignificant: let's say that any of the Amazon models can fit in back pocket of jeans. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/241/71c/e72/24171ce7287741e1b9491f7430475f4a.jpg"><br>  <i>(The order of the left - to the right: Kindle 6, Kindle Paperwhite).</i> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/bf2/96a/a17/bf296aa1782141a8acc27eb4f5b51ea1.jpg"><br>  <i>(The order of the left - to the right: Kindle 6, Kindle Paperwhite, Kindle 5).</i> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/c99/0bd/6b9/c990bd6b9aff4317b6dfdfeb83c756b4.jpg"><br>  <i>(Top-down sequence: Kindle 5, Kindle Paperwhite, Kindle 6).</i> <br><br>  After a brief download, Kindle predictably prompts us to choose an interface language.  And now among the standard sample appeared Russian.  Interestingly, by choosing the Russian interface, we automatically (i.e., do not even need an Internet connection) obtain linguistic dictionaries: English-Russian, Russian-English and Russian explanatory. <br>  "Russian" Kindle out of the box is available to us for the first time, and immediately say that this is one of the main advantages of the model.  Of course, there will remain those who want to increase the functionality of the device, but still for the most part of users now the jailbreak is not needed. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/c33/d7c/9b4/c33d7c9b4b2a41439a932f6c7f5401e5.jpg"><br><br><h4>  Display. </h4><br>  The screen of the new Kindle (with a classic 6-inch diagonal) is ‚Äúsunk‚Äù into the case a little more and is about half a centimeter higher than the Kindle Paperwhite.  The resolution of 800x600 has long become the standard for the basic model of "readers", it remains as such in the new Kindle. <br><br>  The sensor is now, apparently, infrared: it does not react through the packaging film (as in Paperwhite), but it responds without problems, for example, to the tip of the pen.  In this case, the lack of sensitivity is not observed: everything works clearly. <br><br>  One of the pleasant moments of the fresh reader was the speed: Kindle 6 is currently the fastest in the line.  Updating pages is noticeably faster and Paperwhite, and Kindle 5, which is good. <br><br>  Comparing the quality of the ‚Äúpictures‚Äù Kindle 5, Kindle 6 and Kindle Paperwhite, we can say the following.  Even with the backlight turned off completely (not in the ‚Äú0‚Äù position, but really off), Kindle Paperwhite has the most pleasant ‚Äúwhite‚Äù of the listed ‚Äúreaders‚Äù, Kindle 5 is slightly more ‚Äúgray‚Äù, Kindle 6 with a slight lag turned out to be the darkest. <br><br>  With drawing the text, prioritizing is not so simple: in general, all three books do it perfectly.  And only after looking well, again we see the advantage of Kindle Paperwhite (affects higher resolution).  The Kindle 5 and Kindle 6 display text almost equally with (maybe) a slight advantage of the newer reader. <br><br><h4>  Functionality </h4><br>  It should be said that the interface of the new reader completely repeats the Kindle Paperwhite, so users of the model will not find anything new for themselves. <br><br>  Control of the Kindle 6 is fully touch.  There is one single power button, which most often will not be used, as now the ‚Äúsmart‚Äù cover itself activates and puts the device to sleep. <br>  Note also that this time, Amazon has not released covers with built-in backlight, but offers a third-party trailer flashlight on the official website. <br><br>  Kindle 6 has more than 3 GB of memory available for storing books, which, on average, will be enough for three thousand art books, and in each of them the ‚Äúreader‚Äù will remember the place where we will stop reading.  It is always possible to bookmark, highlight text, write a comment or simply select a specific word to get its translation (Kindle also has the option of separately learning the previously marked words).  It is very convenient to scroll through the bookmarks in the additional window with the main open.  A six-inch screen is not always enough for comfortable reading .pdf, but if necessary, the Kindle is ready to cope with this task.  A built-in browser will allow you to feel relatively comfortable if you need to read articles on the Internet. <br><br>  For more on Kindle 6 features, see the second part <a href="http://geektimes.ru/post/197866/">of the Kindle Paperwhite review</a> . <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/f86/752/ba2/f86752ba20204e57a7937e51dd9f2f87.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/e46/0f4/5fa/e460f45fada7484cbef4a25ab169c3b5.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/96e/72f/ce4/96e72fce41dd4d84bd807e9b1b8c3fb0.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/792/71e/305/79271e3051974ec5adb6830dfb72f610.jpg"><br><br><h4>  Information for those who are not familiar with Amazon readers. </h4><br>  The Kindle Readers have several distinctive moments that can often lead the user to choose another brand. <br><br>  By default (without additional firmware) all versions of the popular Kindle perceive only the .pdf, .mobi, .txt formats.  What is solved in a large number of ways, in particular such: directly from the device via wi-fi from <a href="http://flibusta.net/">filibusta</a> download almost any ‚Äúart‚Äù in the right format. <br><br>  Not everyone's liking such a feature that sometimes it is not very easy to organize a large number of books on the device: if they were downloaded into folders in the Kindle memory, then adding to the menu will happen in a crowd;  they can be sorted by time added, by author, by name.  However, after registration, it is possible to create collections, which can be called a kind of substitution of folders. <br><br>  About the need to Russify the interface in all earlier models already mentioned, but Kindle 6, to the joy, will not be able to scare away this feature. <br><br>  Do not look for Kindle extended functionality in the form of an alarm clock, calculator or drawing application.  Kindle is designed to enjoy reading and easily working with text. <br><br><h4>  Conclusion </h4><br>  The Kindle 6 is a new Amazon Reader without backlighting that almost completely repeats all the best features of Kindle Paperwhite.  As always, a very attractive price and just a little bit losing the ‚Äúpicture‚Äù of the text display certainly will not become an obstacle to its success among budget readers.  But for those who are wary of touch devices, we advise to hurry up and buy a Kindle 5: most likely by the end of the year they will not be found. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/5a4/005/241/5a400524174d4d96a4d73026f4413eac.jpg"><br><br>  <i>Padzyaka Alyaksandru, K—ñrylu —ñ —ñ—ñ, hto dapamaga—û valiki.</i> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/361945/">https://habr.com/ru/post/361945/</a></p>
