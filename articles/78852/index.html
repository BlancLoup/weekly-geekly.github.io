      I asked for advice in LJ ru_mac, they said that the magnets most likely refused. <br><br>  I came from a / c Amos (http://www.amos.ru/), instead of the promised work hours from 10, from / c worked from 11. <br>  Having spent 1 hour, I waited for the ‚Äúmaster‚Äù, saying that most likely the loops were spoiled or the magnets he took the macbook and issued a receipt saying that they would call me in the evening. <br><br>  It was <b>November 2</b> . <br><br><h4>  Began! </h4><br><br>  Of course they didn't call me.  A day later I called Amos, and they said that there was a problem with the hinges, and they would order a new cover and wait for <b>3 weeks</b> (I didn‚Äôt understand why I need to change the loops for 3 weeks) <br><br>  Because  This is a working machine, I could not wait for 3 weeks. <br><br>  I called re: Store, explained the situation, they said that I would bring TK and they would give the money or change it to a new macbook. <br><br>  After that, I phoned to Amos, where they quickly sent me, explaining that they would not issue me TK.  with re: Store they do not work. <br><br>  Well, what to do?  I started calling re: Store to get the address of a service center that works with a mini. <br>  I was told that there is one next to me (AU-Guarantee), I asked: Does the AU-Guarantee work with you or like Amos. <br><br>  In the conversation, they found out that the laptop is already inspected, but they refuse to issue TK for re: Store.  Then they advised to write a letter to them, and they will send it to Moscow to the authorities and the matter will be decided there. <br><br>  A day later, I phoned the center of Apple. <br>  They said that the store itself should ask for a TK, or they can call Amos and ask them for a TK in which it will be written that I refuse to repair it. <br>  I didn‚Äôt understand what the consequences would be, but I called Re: Store, where I was asked to wait for the second half of the day when they would answer my claims. <br><br>  By the way, AMOS, contrary to my desire, independently ordered spare parts for repairs, in fact there was no diagnostics, if I hadn‚Äôt called on Friday, but had waited for me to call, I would get a laptop only in a month. <br><br>  About a week after putting the macbook, I agreed with re: Store, about the substitution. <br>  They gave me an older model MB 467, not a new one, slightly scratched.  Under the receipt of course, in which all scratches found by me were indicated. <br><br>  What a naive I was when I thought that they would fix a laptop for me in 3 weeks. <br><br><h4>  The final </h4><br><br>  49 days have passed since the filing of a laptop repair.  On the 44th day I called Amos (rays of diarrhea), where I was told that before the 20th one could not count on it.  Therefore, with a clear conscience, I called re: Store and said that I wanted to either return the money or exchange it for a working MacBook, and agreed to exchange it. <br><br>  I arrived on Saturday with a set from an old macbook and with a substitution.  There was no older seller on the spot, but because  A box from an old MacBook somewhere was lying around, I did not take it. <br><br>  Therefore, the exchange was denied to me, until they talked to the authorities and they would call me back (they did not call me :(), I could barely give them a substitution and collect my receipt. <br><br>  Today I somewhere dug up a box and arrived at re: Store right in the morning, everything went like clockwork, though I paid the difference between the laptops (3 thousand a week‚Äôs price rose :(), filled out the return papers and received a new macbook. <br><br>  Now I am writing from a new Macbook Pro MB990 for 52990 rubles. <br><br>  I want to send beams of diarrhea, right up to the closing of the service center Amos (http://www.amos.ru/), thanks to the muddachestvo of their service center, I lost the opportunity to buy a replacement for 49990 (i.e., no surcharge) and get a discount upon purchase ( 10% of the price of 4,990 rubles.) Which was available until October 31. <br>  As a result, due to the service center Amos, I lost a total of 7990 rubles. I could buy myself a new mouse = / <br><br>  I would also like to mention re: store, which is attached to the lack of packaging, which by the way is not included in the package and is not legally related with a mandatory return. <br><br>  But still I want to express my gratitude to re: Store, for the fact that today they quickly let me go and did not teach tricks. <br><br><h4>  Conclusion </h4><br>  Even if you have a branded laptop or another device, remember that where you live, you will take off from this. <br>  You are required to give out a substitution for the period of repair, but you should not take it in the c / c, they can issue a model of 2000, the law does not say that the laptop should be of a class not lower than that delivered. <br>  Strictly keep track of how the repair is going on and if you do not fit into the 45-day period, then go boldly to the store. <br>  Hand over the broken device directly to the store, not to the s / c, and to the store.  If I did it right away, then everything would have passed, much better. <br>  And best of all, that you would not break the technique :) <br><br><h4>  Links to LJ </h4><br>  <a href="http://community.livejournal.com/ru_mac/12272522.html">community.livejournal.com/ru_mac/12272522.html</a> <br>  <a href="http://community.livejournal.com/ru_mac/12896035.html">community.livejournal.com/ru_mac/12896035.html</a> <br>  <a href="http://community.livejournal.com/ru_mac/13417053.html">community.livejournal.com/ru_mac/13417053.html</a> <br><br><h4>  PS </h4><br>  Dear employees with / c Amos! <br>  If the damage is connected with magnets or loops, then how would you not want, but the chance that the top cover will arrive earlier than 45 days is very small. <br><br>  Also, the muddiness of some employees with a / c exceeds all limits. <br>  Generally suck lozenges and learn from macsolutions.ru (they immediately issue a decision that cannot be repaired) <br>  And yet it is worthwhile to offer a substitution, when the repair delays more than 1-2 days. <br><br><h4>  Pss </h4><br>  I still think that replacing the entire top cover is not a dick, not a repair. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/78852/">https://habr.com/ru/post/78852/</a></p>
