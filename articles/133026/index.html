  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Mobile solutions are becoming a popular destination for startups.</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  The results of accepting applications for the competition <a href="http://www.web-ready.ru/novosti/opredelen_sostav_polufinalistov_web_ready_2011/">Web Ready 2011</a> .  579 applications were filed, which is a third more compared to 2010.  Does this mean that Internet business is becoming more and more popular in Russia ?!  We were interested in analyzing projects.  As a result, we learned which direction is becoming popular for start-ups, from which cities most of the projects, which universities need to go to help the project in development and which specialty to get. <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  Leaders among the cities that represent Internet startups are still St. Petersburg and Moscow (175 and 123 applications, respectively).  But their share of the total number of applications this year has decreased.  If in 2010, from two capitals 61% of all applications were filed, in this - 51%.  Due to this, the share of Internet projects from the rest of Russia increased significantly. <br><br>  The third place in the number of applications was taken by Novosibirsk - 25, which showed the most significant growth, with the exception of St. Petersburg, compared with last year (+20 applications), followed by Ekaterinburg - 23 (+15) and Perm - 23 (+17) .  Among the cities representing foreign countries, Minsk became the leader - 15 applications, which replaced Kiev, the former with the 9th application last year.  Of the foreign countries, the most applications were from Ukraine - 21, Belarus - 16 and Latvia - 4.

      The popularity of creating a business on the Internet is definitely growing and comes to the regions.  The quality of start-ups is also growing, more and more information on creating innovative business can be obtained on the Internet and it is not necessary to live in Silicon Valley or megalopolis. <br><br>  The most popular areas of projects, as in the past year, remained Web projects and SaaS solutions (they account for 42% of applications).  The most significant increase in the number of projects occurred in the direction of mobile applications.  If last year 55 projects were submitted from this sphere, then this year - 139 (!). A significant increase in the number of projects in the field of mobile technologies reflects the trend of today, when new effective solutions for mobile devices are in demand by consumers.  You can clearly see the development trend of the projects on the charts for 2009-2011. <br><br>  <b>Project focus 2009:</b> <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/9f1388ed/3975060e/8918f158/5f3cbc7b.png"><br><br>  <b>Project focus 2010:</b> <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/52dc60fc/3747ed34/9a5c0d39/3773d685.png"><br><br>  <b>The focus of projects in 2011:</b> <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/d4a6006b/17694318/892ef39d/a00ebcc4.png"><br><br>  As for universities, the most popular among the contestants were St. Petersburg State University, ITMO and Moscow State University. <br>  The leader among universities not from Petersburg and Moscow was the Novosibirsk State Technical University, which accounted for 2.17% of applications.  In the overall ranking, he shares 7-8 places with MGTU im.  Bauman. <br><br>  According to the survey, 35% of project managers who applied for the competition have a law degree.  In addition, about 60% of specialists in the project team have a liberal arts education. <br><br>  Ten of the best universities that represent the participants of Web Ready 2011: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/867428b6/309e8c54/77ddc5e7/12a03f72.png"><br><br>  Summarizing the data obtained, it turns out such an individual: <br>  A man from St. Petersburg (Moscow), who develops a web portal and studies at St. Petersburg State University (MSU) at the Faculty of Law. <br><br>  Does anyone know themselves?) </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/133026/">https://habr.com/ru/post/133026/</a></p>
