  <section class="page js-page"><h1>The experience of repairing a communicator in Euroset - Pro-Service</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  This sad story tells how the communicator was repaired in the company Pro-Service (a subsidiary of Euroset). <br><br>  By and large, rumors that this service center has been carrying out repairs for a long time and not too qualitatively have been wandering around the Net for a long time;  but the author of this article was able to verify this in practice. <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  The story began quite trivial - with the purchase on the Internet communicator HTC Touch Pro.  Before this device, I bought a lot of things on the forums and in the good old Fido, so the test experience before buying was solid.  But Touch had a strange ‚Äúglitch‚Äù, which at the time of the acquisition was impossible to detect: after a more or less lengthy conversation, a bar appeared in the lower part of the display, which was visible only on a dark background and displayed the contents of other applications;  more often, it looked like a faded lettering ‚ÄúKeyboard‚Äù - ‚ÄúMessages‚Äù.

      Also, despite the complete set and PCT certification, the communicator had an unsigned warranty card without a check, which at first seemed normal to me (very often, when buying at the store, there was no sale date in the warranty card, which allowed us to ‚Äúextend‚Äù the warranty).  The only information available is that the device was purchased somewhere in the online store in Moscow, the production date (from which the warranty period is calculated in the absence of a warranty card) is August 8, 2008. <br><br>  The defect and the reasons for its appearance were safely discovered in a couple of weeks, after which the device, freshly purchased and very necessary for work (adminit), was delivered to the Pro-Service service center, which is five minutes away from the house (and go to another there was no time).  Yes, ‚ÄúPro-Service‚Äù is an authorized HTC c / c.  Since that time, the fun time of communication with Euroset begins - December 19, 2008. <br>  Externally, the Pro-Service services look very decent - this is an opportunity to check the status of the repair of the device via the Internet (which is actually absent, because the status is not updated), and the opportunity to call a girl with a beautiful voice that voices this status (the status is always voiced with different variations - "under repair", "waiting for parts", "not yet ready"). <br><br>  In early January, after another call to the switchboard girl, it turned out that I could pick up the repaired phone.  Upon arrival, I find out that a ‚Äúsoftware replacement‚Äù was performed to repair the device, or, to put it more simply, a flashing, which I, of course, did myself several times before giving it to the c / c device.  In this case, the engineer did not even read the essence of the malfunction, which, as I described above, appears after a certain time after the conversation.  Checking the time counter, of course, it turned out that the engineer did not make a phone call at all, that is, could not see the defect, and for three weeks the device lay in the s / c on ‚Äúsoftware update‚Äù, which, too, was not updated, since  A pair of files remained in the device that I did not delete from it.  That is, with the phone did not do anything at all. <br><br>  I wrote a complaint, I was contacted by a representative of the Euroset reclamation department and informed that some kind of spare part is required for the repair of the device (which one is not specified), which can be ordered, but it will take about two weeks.  Since at that time (01/15/09) the device had lain in service for almost a month, I agree - I still bought a simple Fujitsu-Siemens T830 to replace it for little money, and it‚Äôs simply unwise to take the communicator out of the service after a month. <br><br>  February came, followed by March.  The status of the device is ‚Äúwaiting for spare parts‚Äù, a proposal to give me a paper that the device cannot be repaired (which I do not need in any case, and first of all because after three months of repair I would like to take the repaired device). <br><br>  In March, the device was still ‚Äúwaiting for parts‚Äù, so I finally decided to pick it up from the Pro-Service service center and repair it in another one, for which I called the reclamation department and asked me to return the device to me (March 18, 2009).  To date (March 24th), the courier still carries him to the reception point. <br><br>  This is the experience of communication with Euroset / Pro-Service.  There is an elementary ignorance, failure to comply with any reasonable repair deadlines, and all this against the background of an absolutely non-functional bureaucracy.  I sincerely sympathize with people who purchase equipment in Euroset. <br><br>  PS I would like to learn from knowledgeable habraradey: 1) what detail can be the fault of such an exotic "glitch"?  2) What service centers will be able to carry out a warranty / non-warranty repair of the device within a reasonable time?  3) what would you do in a similar situation? </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/55387/">https://habr.com/ru/post/55387/</a></p>
