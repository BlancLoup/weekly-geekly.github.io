The Office proposes to make changes to Art.  9 of the Federal Law 126 "On communication", <a href="http://izvestia.ru/news/606393">write</a> "News".  According to a source close to the leadership of the Ministry of Communications and Mass Media, this rule is due to the need to ensure the information security of Russia.  It is stated that ‚Äúrequirements arising from the need to ensure the integrity and sustainability of the unified communications network of Russia can be made to Russian telecom operators.‚Äù

      At the same time, the majority of experts polled by Izvestia found it difficult to estimate the number of companies that provide communication services in Russia without a legal person in the country.  According to experts, their approximate number is 1-2% of the total number of operators. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Currently, operators are guided by the RF Government Decree No. 610 of 9 November 2004 ‚ÄúOn Approving the Regulations on the Construction and Operation of Communication Lines when Crossing the State Border of the Russian Federation, in the Border Area, in Inland Marine Waters and in the Territorial Sea of ‚Äã‚Äãthe Russian Federation‚Äù.  According to this decree, to obtain the right to create a cross-border communication line, an organization must go through a complicated procedure of registration and coordination.  For this reason, most often ‚Äúcross-border crossings‚Äù are built by Russian telecom operators, less often by companies that own their own communication networks. <br><br>  ‚ÄúIf such a bill is prepared by the Ministry of Communications and Mass Media, it will prohibit any company that are not telecom operators from crossing the Internet border.  There are not many such companies, but they exist.  To become a telecom operator, you need to obtain a license that imposes a number of obligations on telecom operators, including the need to interact with the authorities, ‚Äùsays Ilya Massuh, President of the Information Democracy Foundation. <br><br>  Interestingly, MTS has already expressed support for the amendment proposed by the Ministry of Communications. <br><br>  ‚ÄúIt was supposed that we could be disconnected from the global Internet, or if something happens, we should disconnect from the outside world.  The state has a list of sites that should stop working if anything happens.  Such a system exists in China.  There they made a very expensive system that allows you to block access to any site for residents of the country.  In our country, even now when Roskomnadzor is blocked, access to some sites remains.  And such measures will have to help, if necessary, to fully block, ‚ÄùDenis Kuskov, general director of TelecomDaily analytical company, comments on the situation. <br><br>  Earlier it was <a href="https://geektimes.ru/post/270870/">reported</a> that to implement the instructions of the President, the Ministry of Communications and Mass Media has now developed a draft law on state control over the passage of Internet traffic in Russia.  It was also planned that the traffic exchange points would be entered into the state register and they would be obliged to use only their operators so that the internal Russian would not go across the border.  Experts believe that the project to create a "single Russian network" will be implemented by Rostelecom. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/391741/">https://habr.com/ru/post/391741/</a></p>
