      The main news of the last week in the blogosphere was the launch by Yandex of two new communication services: <a href="http://fotki.yandex.ru/">Yandex.Fotki</a> and <a href="http://beta.ya.ru/">Ya.Ru.</a>  We are interested in the latter because it is the long-awaited YandexBlogs.  True, the blogs in the company decided not to call them.  Judging by the first impression, the success of Livejournal did not allow Yandex managers and programmers to sleep, but MySpace, a social evil.  Thank God, the Russian communication service is not overloaded with useless features and has, in comparison with myspace, a clear interface.  I will not call it convenient, because there are several points that confuse me, but after all, ‚ÄúYa.ru‚Äù is currently considered to be a beta version, so the developers in direct time mode are constantly polishing their brainchild. <br><br>  Nevertheless, I can‚Äôt get rid of the feeling that the number of social networks in the world wide web has exceeded the critical mark and people become satiated.  Anyway, it has already come to me.  So let's prepare a wonderful fresh "Ya.ru".  Service is convenient, in my opinion, the developers really took all the best and most interesting from other social networks.  The fact that this is the best Russian social network becomes clear almost immediately.  Convenient integration, perhaps, with all well-known blog services and platforms (thanks to OpenID for the happy youth), namely: broadcasting your posts from other blogs;  transfer of friends and, accordingly, frend tapes;  insert your profile from "My Circle" (which is natural after its purchase by Yandex);  a detailed description of a loved one in his profile (for example, at the time of writing these terms in ‚ÄúYa.ru‚Äù, there were 11 other users besides me) and so on and so forth.  But having played one and a half hours with the new service, I again returned to my LiveJournal and Google.  And, for example, I can‚Äôt even imagine what such a ‚ÄúYandex‚Äù can do to draw the public from other popular Russian-speaking services to itself.  By the way, entertaining statistics about the state of the blogosphere <a href="">was published</a> just in the ‚ÄúYandex‚Äù blog.  The two most popular blog hosting sites for Russian-speaking users are obvious: LiveJournal.com and LiveInternet.ru.  Some more facts.  The largest number of Russian-speaking bloggers, except for Moscow and St. Petersburg, live in the capitals of other countries.  There are more authors in Kiev, Minsk and Tallinn than in Samara or Novosibirsk.  Over the past six months, the average Russian-speaking blogger has not changed - this is a 21-year-old Moscow student.  In general, follow the link, there is also a cognitive diagram.  So, why this 21-year-old Moscow student, or the 25-year-old Minsk parasite, or the 30-year-old Odessan to move to ‚ÄúYa.Ru‚Äù is absolutely not clear.  But if you just decided to start a blog for yourself, then yes - try it.  And you should definitely try if you, due to tragic circumstances, turned out to be the owner of the blog on "Rambler" or mail.ru.  And, again, for general development, it‚Äôs worth joining - then you can in the smoking room (you smoke? I hate you! Everyone except Sergei Poznyak), thoughtfully blowing smoke rings on the ceiling, say: ‚ÄúWell, yes, I also got an account for ‚ÄúYa.ru,‚Äù but something they have won over there, and it's always buggy. ‚Äù  Moreover, while access to the carcass "Ya.ru" is a roundabout way.  That is, no one will give you just to register and taste the fruits of technical progress - you must either solicit an invitation from some thread of the Ya.Ru party or heavily post photos on Yandex.Fotki, then the invitation will come to you.  A buggy really often.  But, again, beta costs.  I'll add some more funny design options to the minuses.  Of course, it is possible to customize everything to your taste, but those templates that are provided for lazy users and people without taste, depress their glamor.  And at the same time they demonstrate who the ‚ÄúYa.ru‚Äù is supposed to be.  And the most terrible innovation, which personally annoys me very much, is the reward system called ‚ÄúKu‚Äù.  For your actions (posting photos, new entries, frending) you get points, after the number of points exceeds a certain value, you get another ‚ÄúKu‚Äù, and a crown flaunts over your avatar for the whole day.  I was always on the forums enraged by the message counters, and then there was also this nursery with a crown.  Well, okay, let them play if only they are busy.  After all, they‚Äôve seen that giving friends also give points, and let's make friends with everyone.  I‚Äôm friends with hundreds of strangers who have already added over 2000 friends to themselves just for the sake of these points.  Of course, in ‚ÄúYandex‚Äù they rejoice - the service barely works, and the public is already having fun with might and main, but this is not the kind of entertainment.  Okay, all this is the grumbling of a man from the side.  I still send you to <a href="http://www.merkurov.ru/blog/2007/04/21/1244">read the opinion of a</a> citizen and our old friend Merkurov, who also did not miss the opportunity to test a new service and, unlike me, believes in all good. <br><br>  <strong>Rating turns man</strong> <br><br>  However, I will dedicate one more paragraph to Yandex.  They do not forget about other blogs there and continue to improve the search and ranking mechanism.  He earned a <a href="http://blogs.yandex.ru/top/com">rating of the communities of the</a> Russian blogosphere.  In addition, from this point on, community owners have access to all rating features that previously only personal blog authors could use ‚Äî you can now install blog search buttons and counters in communities. <br><br>  Naturally, there will always be people dissatisfied with their place in the rating, as well as the mechanics of compiling this rating.  Mark Yevgenyevich Sandomirsky is not just unhappy; <a href="http://re3.livejournal.com/14680.html">he accuses</a> the Yandex rating of manipulating the mass consciousness.  And offers its alternative TOP-12, compiled by the method of expert assessments, by interviewing several dozen intelligent people who have a professional attitude to psychology, journalism, economics, science and technology (including IT-specialists).  Respondents were asked ‚Äî the LJ regulars and the movement enthusiasts ‚Äî to arrange the blogs in order of priority from the Yandex TOP-10, and also add a couple of them to the reserve.  Understandably, a hot controversy unfolded on this issue and everyone began to measure ratings.  And only I - just the smartest and beautiful by all expert estimates and ratings. <br><br>  <strong>God god blog</strong> <br><br>  Anton Nosik (no, the title is not about him) on his blog <a href="http://dolboeb.livejournal.com/927122.html">informs</a> about the appearance of the long-awaited ‚Äúlj-embed‚Äù tag in your blog, into which you can insert the code of any multimedia service (for example, those who play video and audio, for example, YouTube or imeem .com)  A corrosive reader will reasonably ask: could it not have been possible to simply insert code before?  Of course, it was possible, but only the code of those services that have passed the testing of their specifications at Six Apart and are on the <a href="http://community.livejournal.com/sup_ru/125349.html">white list</a> .  For example, from Russian hosters this list included only the Video.Mail.Ru service.  Now you can embed any media content into your blog.  However, with this tag is not so simple, at the time of this writing, several glitches were discovered, the most serious of which is the automatic reproduction of the placed file.  So, read the comments. <br><br>  Five minutes of culture.  I do not get surprised at the diversity of human nature.  Thanks to the Internet and communities, I sometimes learn about such preferences and interests of people, which even becomes somehow uncomfortable.  Community of <a href="http://community.livejournal.com/ru_childfree">Russian-speaking</a> children (free from children, that is).  There gathered people who deliberately do not want children, moreover - they do not love children.  Many important problems are discussed: why it is impossible to do sterilization up to 35 years old, why society with incomprehension refers to the value system of childfree, for how much money they will nevertheless agree to have a child.  And further in the same spirit.  Humanity, it's time to die. <br><br>  And again, Ivan Sagalaev with his Maniacal Weblog gets on the holy pages of "KV".  Today he <a href="http://softwaremaniacs.org/blog/2007/04/13/sync-everything">tells us</a> about the synchronization of "everything".  Keep in mind that the solution is purely programmatic, and for synchronization of everything Ivan uses a subversion server.  A word to the author: ‚ÄúWhat is strange, the decision suddenly somehow came to mind.  It so happened that I have a subversion server on my hosting that serves my programmer projects.  And I suddenly thought that the synchronization of the code is no different from the synchronization of everything else for the simple reason that almost all Unix software stores its settings as separate files in a home directory. ‚Äù <br><br>  <strong>Sad epilogue</strong> <br><br>  You will forgive that so much about ‚ÄúYandex‚Äù was, yes, I myself was not happy.  But, you see, I deserved it.  In a short time I promise a great article about social networks and, of course, your favorite blog reviews. <br><br>  Lesha Kaletsky </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/287766/">https://habr.com/ru/post/287766/</a></p>
