She is already on the air on the website MegaIndex.tv, anyone can traditionally take part in the conference, listen to the speakers and ask questions. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/a6a/1b9/795/a6a1b97959d438676189c595157dc828.png" alt="image"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  Modern online store only looks like a website, in fact it is a complex structure that is created using a variety of tools.  They all have one goal - to increase sales by properly segmenting the audience.  If advertising products are aimed at attracting an audience, then solutions ‚Äúbolted‚Äù to the site are areas of customer retention and tools for optimizing the sales funnel.

    <h4>  Digital marketing (programmable buying) </h4><br><br>  Our regular viewers already know that the concept is broad and includes many aspects.  The last MegaIndex conference vividly showed how much the digital sphere includes.  Today, Nikolai Khivrin will touch on such a topic directly related to the increase in sales in the e-commerce system, such as programmable buying - in other words, an overview of the possibilities of working with the customer base, visitors to your online store, technological methods of retaining and returning customers, stimulating the second purchase and much more .  We strongly advise not to miss this overview presentation today at 13:00. <br>  Programmable showcase and trigger system. <br><br>  One of the most widely used types of tools for e-commerce are various kinds of trigger systems.  Mechanisms similar in principle are used now in the new generation of ‚Äúcatch-up‚Äù advertising.  Although implemented in different ways, both methods basically show a person (customer) certain products depending on their user profile, which need not be available after registering on the site - it can also be read from anonymous sources of cookies.  Reasonable use of such tools can increase sales at times.  This will be discussed today by speakers Oleg Basha, Daniel Khanin and Mikhail Kechinov. <br><br><h4>  Online consultant </h4><br><br>  Some time ago, almost all online stores tried to acquire the interface of an online consultant.  This phenomenon has become so large that at one time it was even criticized.  Indeed, if a good tool is used too deliberately and universally, the impression of it can become ambivalent.  Emil Amanov today will tell how to increase sales through the proper use of this tool. <br><br><h4>  Mobile Store </h4><br><br>  You can expand your influence on the market not only by retaining the client and working properly with it, but also by expanding your presence to mobile devices.  What benefits can you get with a mobile trading platform?  Do you need it and where to get it?  You can learn about this by listening to the speech of Andrei Grigoriev. <br><br>  Of course, we have listed here not all reports and not all speakers.  You can find out more about the list of the declared program on the website <a href="http://megaindex.tv/ecom2014/">MegaIndex.tv</a> - there you can also connect to the broadcast, for this you will not need to register.  However, if you want to receive conference materials by mail in a recording, we recommend that you register.  The materials of the previous MegaIndex conference have already been published <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3DC_QE7AwMFWA%26list%3DPLpM4t5nRDKDoFqUCvB8vNtaSwoxZPR9f7">here</a> . </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/230031/">https://habr.com/ru/post/230031/</a></p>
