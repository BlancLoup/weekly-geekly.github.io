Therefore, when there was a question about changing the case - my choice fell on the product of the Chieftec company, namely Fulltower BA-02B-BB. <br>  I decided to prepare a short review.  Under the cut - exclusively subjective assessment of the product and the photo of the process of "moving" to the new building. <br><br>  Caution, a lot of photos!

    <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  The predecessor, Microtech Bastilia, was bought a very long time ago and became too small for the current configuration: <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/d39edbee/e54cb6c7/6308eb25/5eeed339.jpg"></div><br><br>  It happened in the summer, the heat and hot Q6600@3.2GHz were forced to literally "overlap" fans: <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/c1f5a3b9/8ac99ba8/f253a0a6/d6f137f6.jpg"></div><br><br>  However, this did not help much, and the construction was rather noisy.  Therefore, I wanted something large and spacious so that I could forget about changing the case for at least the next 5 years :) After studying the local prices, I opted for the Chieftec product - Fulltower Chieftec ATX BA-02B-BB.  Here is how it looks in front: <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/a885463b/cfd3a14e/8bc3d0d9/5ce01cc8.jpg"></div><br><br>  And behind: <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/1bd49297/bb9c53b8/d76002b8/a1c7d61a.jpg"></div><br><br>  After a careful examination, you can see very solid dimensions, several side vents (next to the CPU and on the sides of the basket with disks), as well as "locks" for locking the side door and the front plastic panel. <br><br>  "Stuffing" for him was successfully extracted: <br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/74485dbc/14574e5d/5ea2bbac/604475c7.jpg"></div><br><br>  And I began its installation.  And the first thing I did was to provide cooling for the hard drives. <br>  For their blowing, I purchased two Zalman ZM-F2 (not a single fan was originally inside the case), which included anti-vibration silicone mounts and a resistor that lowers the speed of rotation.  The noise from their work when connected through a resistor is at an acceptable (for me) level. <br>  This is how the fans were fixed on the plastic frame: <br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/79a3f1b8/8458efcb/478e6025/6b5083c8.jpg"></div><br>  and were installed inside the case: <br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/55d48cf4/4f8e4067/5ae8e501/3bcc5fab.jpg"></div><br><br>  The Fultower format makes itself felt - there are normally as many as 8 seats for 3.5 "hard drives! The basket with disks with up to 3 fans 92x92 mm is cooled. And I think it is quite effective: there are holes in the side walls of the case, the fans are pumped air flow through. However, with such a scheme it is necessary to provide additional protection against dust. <br><br>  Fastening hard drives screwless, on spec.  sled: <br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/ec5ca154/93e65c7f/67a95513/1dee70ce.jpg"></div><br>  Further mounted mat.  fee.  By the way, almost any board will fit into this case - even E-ATX will be quite comfortable here.  Here‚Äôs what an installed ATX board looks like: <br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/cc975630/f8aad3ce/b38647cd/262e1a65.jpg"></div><br>  I want to draw attention to the "correct" plugs for expansion cards - they are made removable, not "disposable", which is very useful when changing the configuration.  On the back wall, just opposite the CPU cooler, there is room for 120 mm.  fan - there I put the Zalman ZM-F3, which also "slowed down". <br>  Now - we put optical drives.  To do this, wrap the complete bolts in the standard holes: <br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/8faed1e2/0cd433b6/807e1733/5793c51f.jpg"></div><br>  And move the drive in the connector "until it clicks."  The characteristic sound is produced by this mounting system: <br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/893cb44b/995bcb83/1a8fea97/cc0bbd33.jpg"></div><br>  Drives at the same time fixed quite tightly. <br>  In my opinion, the place to store the bolts was very well chosen: <br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/9102716f/964cd875/d0726e67/f54faa0d.jpg"></div><br>  And do not get lost, and always in sight!  By quantity - there are enough of them here, enough to fill, probably, all 5.25 "compartments (of which there are as many as 6 pieces!). But the metal plugs at the seats are made the other way around, breakable, which I do not support - however little things. <br>  Here‚Äôs what the complete system looks like: <br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/737c8917/9e688fb6/521153d8/1c64f45b.jpg"></div><br>  Obviously, no ‚Äúhidden‚Äù cabling, however, when using screeds, there is enough space for ventilation. <br>  Final photos - in comparison with the predecessor: <br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/4d08363e/c60cb964/c5c7b3f0/ab455a20.jpg"></div><br>  And the view of the workplace (monitor 19 "): <br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/e827ca6c/f48c2155/73e68838/2733ae35.jpg"></div><br>  As you can see, the case is on the wide plastic legs.  If desired, furniture wheels can be adapted instead of them - you get a ‚Äúmobile‚Äù system unit :) <br><br>  In general, the sensations from the body are very positive: <br>  + reasonableness in the details; <br>  + excellent workmanship <br>  + the ability to build an effective (and more or less quiet) cooling system; <br>  + ease of mounting equipment; <br>  + the ability to accommodate almost any equipment; <br>  + "Thingies" like a wall lock. <br>  And all this at an affordable price (approx. 3,500 rubles). <br><br>  Of course, there are drawbacks - for example, sometimes the side walls of the case ‚Äúenter into resonance‚Äù and begin to rattle systematically, but this happens very rarely.  Yes, and then surely there are ways to somehow dampen such vibrations.  Well, the dimensions of many will be pushed away - not everyone agrees on such a ‚Äúbandura‚Äù :) <br><br>  My verdict - I recommend! </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/101515/">https://habr.com/ru/post/101515/</a></p>
