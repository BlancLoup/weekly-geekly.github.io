The main purpose of the service is to help you increase the conversion rate on the site.  And he copes with it perfectly.  The number of customers is growing by leaps and bounds. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/125/488/d5f/125488d5fca44c0faf3d9d00acf299ed.jpg"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  I myself have been using this service for quite a long time and I think that it is the best among analogs.  The only thing in which it loses some functions of Yandex. Metrics is the price.  You need to pay for it if you do not want to have restrictions.  As my experience suggests, many Internet marketers in Runet stop this.  But here everyone decides for himself whether he needs it or not. <br><br><h2>  Hotjar: service functionality </h2><br><h2>  1.

Based on this, you will understand how visitors interact with the interface. <br><br>  <strong>Examples of using:</strong> <br><br>  You analyze the card of clicks on the site and see that a large proportion of clicks falls on a certain element.  At the same time, the element is not clickable.  But, since the visitors are constantly pressing on it, it means they think that when they are clicked, they will go to a certain page. <br><br>  Based on this data, you will know exactly which elements need to be clickable. <br><br>  So you will understand where visitors click most often.  Perhaps it will be buttons that lead visitors to the process of buying.  This means that either these buttons need to be removed from the interface altogether, or that the visitor does not leave the ‚Äúpath‚Äù to purchase. <br><br>  If you look at a scrolling card, it is very useful for long landing pages, long pages, as well as content marketers.  A scrolling map for 3 seconds will show whether potential customers are browsing your landing page, whether they are reading your long articles at all. <br><br>  I advise you to read - <a href="http://boosta.ru/ab-testirovanie/ideas/kak-najti-ideyu-dlya-av-testa-teplovye-karty-i-oprosy/">How to find an idea for the A / B test: heat maps and polls</a> <br><br><h2>  2. Recording sessions (Visitor Recordings) </h2><br>  <em>This function is also available for <a href="">Yandex. Metrics.</a></em> <br><br><img title="How Hotjar helps increase conversions (Service Overview and 3 Case Studies)" src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/megamozg/post_images/4f5/41f/e1e/4f541fe1edbe3d34dda7fe900e49a969.png" alt="  Hotjar    (   3 )" width="689" height="457"><br><br>  <strong>What sessions give:</strong> <br><br>  You can see how each visitor interacts with the interface of your site.  You will see all the clicks, cursor movements, how much time a person spends in each part of the page, what problems arise in certain browsers or devices. <br><br>  And you have the opportunity to filter the records, put tags on them and add to favorites to make the analysis more convenient. <br><br>  <strong>Usage example:</strong> <br><br>  After viewing the sessions, you noticed that visitors entering via Internet Explorer do not see the button for placing an order at all.  Accordingly, in principle, they cannot convert to customers, even if they really want to. <br><br>  Based on this information, you promptly send the task to the developers, they correct the layout, and all visitors to the site with Internet Explorer make purchases without any problems.  Everyone is happy.  Business is uphill! <br><br>  By the way, you can find such jambs not only through viewing records.  Google Analytics has some very cool reports that help you find all the conversion killers.  We dedicated a <a href="http://boosta.ru/web-analytics/oni-pomogut-najti-vsex-ubijc-konversii-10-otchyotov-v-google-analytics/">whole article to them</a> , which gathered more than 40,000+ views on several sites. <br><br>  The function of viewing sessions is also in Yandex.Metrica and is called WebVizor.  If you do not want to spend money on Hotjar, you can use it without any problems.  By the way, when using a webcam, I strongly advise you to use segmentation in order not to analyze everyone. <br><br>  I advise you to read - <a href="http://boosta.ru/ab-testirovanie/cases/10-uspeshnyx-kejsov-ab-testirovaniya/">10 successful cases of A / B testing</a> <br><br><h2>  3. Sales Funnels </h2><br>  <em>This function is also available for Yandex. Metrics.</em> <br><br><img title="How Hotjar helps increase conversions (Service Overview and 3 Case Studies)" src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/megamozg/post_images/110/7d4/33c/1107d433cee972d2d79e26a11b76aaf4.png" alt="  Hotjar    (   3 )" width="689" height="457"><br><br>  <strong>What gives the sales funnel:</strong> <br><br>  If you make a sequence of actions that lead to the final goal (for example, a purchase), you will see at what stages you have the most problems. <br><br>  Accordingly, where most users fall off, there and you need to invest all efforts to increase conversion. <br><br>  In my opinion, the only disadvantage of the sales funnel in <a href="https://www.hotjar.com/r/r8c63">Hotjar</a> is that it is not built on events (events), but on page transitions.  Although the situation is the same with Google Analytics and Yandex.Metrica.  But in the last two we still have the opportunity to make a funnel from the events, although it will not be easy for newcomers to solve this problem. <br><br>  Alternatively you can use Mixpanel.  In this service, in general, all analytics is based on events and properties that are assigned to users.  This is where building sales funnels is incredibly convenient and simple. <br><br>  Generally, if your business does not yet have a funnel, on the basis of which you measure the client's path from the first contact to the purchase, then this is a huge omission.  I advise you right now to be bent on this issue. <br><br>  I advise you to read - <a href="http://boosta.ru/web-analytics/oni-pomogut-najti-vsex-ubijc-konversii-10-otchyotov-v-google-analytics/">They will help you find all the "killers" of conversion - 10 reports in Google Analytics</a> <br><br><h2>  4. Form Analytics </h2><br>  <em>This function is also available for <a href="">Yandex. Metrics.</a></em> <br><br><img title="How Hotjar helps increase conversions (Service Overview and 3 Case Studies)" src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/megamozg/post_images/1d7/c64/433/1d7c644333fec72d045bef4f24335ecf.png" alt="  Hotjar    (   3 )" width="689" height="457"><br><br>  <strong>What forms analytics provide:</strong> <br><br>  Each site has a form.  Without them it is impossible to do.  And well, if your form is only one field.  But in most forms they are much more.  So analytics of forms allows you to understand how people fill in each individual field. <br><br>  First, you will find out how much time visitors spend on average filling out each field.  Secondly, you will see on which fields the greatest number of people fall off. <br><br>  If you add a session view to the form analytics, then you can see how visitors fill in the fields.  Perhaps they do not understand something and introduce something completely different.  As a result, they get a form filling error and go to a competitor. <br><br>  <strong>Usage example:</strong> <br><br>  Through analytics of the form, you noticed that the most people fall off in the "Telephone number" field.  There may be two reasons.  First - they do not want to leave a phone number.  The second is the problem with the field itself. <br><br>  OK, look at the session records.  Perhaps the problem is that there is no phone number mask in the field, and a large proportion of visitors simply do not understand that it is necessary to enter the country / city code? <br><br>  If the problem is this, then it is solved very simply.  The task is put to the developer and it makes normal, understandable for people fields. <br><br>  I advise you to read - <a href="http://boosta.ru/ab-testirovanie/cases/startap-plotguru-podnyal-konversiyu-lendinga-s-9-do-52-a-vam-slabo/">Startup Plotguru raised the landing conversion from 9% to 52%.</a>  <a href="http://boosta.ru/ab-testirovanie/cases/startap-plotguru-podnyal-konversiyu-lendinga-s-9-do-52-a-vam-slabo/">Are you weak?</a> <br><br><h2>  5. Embedded polls </h2><br><img title="How Hotjar helps increase conversions (Service Overview and 3 Case Studies)" src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/megamozg/post_images/926/7dd/c12/9267ddc12b2310598234a03bc3b319ac.png" alt="  Hotjar    (   3 )" width="689" height="501"><br><br>  <strong>What do the built-in polls give:</strong> <br><br>  They help to understand the target audience.  There is no better way to know the desires and needs of your target audience than to ask it from her.  Polls are one of the important tools of any advanced internet marketer. <br><br>  The function of embedded polls in <a href="https://www.hotjar.com/r/r8c63">Hotjar</a> can be targeted according to certain conditions.  For example, they can be displayed only on a certain page, after 2 minutes of being on it. <br><br>  <strong>Usage example:</strong> <br><br>  On the product payment page, you know that the user needs on average 2 minutes to go to the next stage.  If he spends more on it, then you can show him a survey asking what prevents him from making a purchase.  Thanks to this question, you will be able to find out many reasons that prevent potential customers from bringing you income. <br><br>  It should be noted that these polls work both in the web version of sites and mobile.  By the way, try launching a survey only on mobile users - find out from them whether it is convenient to use your site on a smartphone.  This will be your first step in data driven marketing. <br><br>  I advise you to read - <a href="http://boosta.ru/ab-testirovanie/advice/kak-uvelichit-konversiyu-30-korotkix-sovetov-dlya-internet-marketologov/">How to increase conversion - 30 short tips for internet marketers</a> <br><br><h2>  6. Polls </h2><br>  A function similar to the previous one, but already more advanced. <br><br><img title="How Hotjar helps increase conversions (Service Overview and 3 Case Studies)" src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/megamozg/post_images/861/bf0/1f8/861bf01f81ecf2aa9a149a8b14249bd4.png" alt="  Hotjar    (   3 )" width="652" height="461"><br><br>  <strong>What do the polls give:</strong> <br><br>  They are used for the same purpose as the previous function - to get as much information as possible from the mouth of the target audience. <br><br>  But in this case, these polls can be used much more widely.  For example, you can directly drop the survey link to the target audience.  Or conduct a survey via e-mail newsletter.  Either poll only those who lead the cursor to the close button of the tab or browser. <br><br>  In general, there are a lot of opportunities to activate surveys.  I personally used different options: <br><ul><li>  Exint-intent polls </li><li>  Polls that take off 20-30 seconds after entering the site </li><li>  Polls that appear after 50% of scrolling on a page </li></ul><br>  From experience, I can say that the first option may work too early, because now people very often switch between tabs without the intention to close the site.  So it was either annoying to many, or just showed up at the moment when they had not done anything on the site. <br><br>  But, in general, polls are an incredible useful and cool thing.  On <a href="http://boosta.ru/">Boosta.ru</a> I spend them one by one.  Thus, I constantly collect feedback from the target audience and develop the site in accordance with their desires and needs. <br><br>  <strong>Usage example:</strong> <br><br> <a href="http://boosta.ru/%3Fattachment_id%3D3244" rel="attachment wp-att-3244"><img title="How Hotjar helps increase conversions (Service Overview and 3 Case Studies)" src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/megamozg/post_images/7a1/e27/f82/7a1e27f82e3d6195a00170d2fb4b063e.jpg" alt="  Hotjar    (   3 )" width="730" height="327"></a> <br><br>  Now in the trend of push-notifications on sites.  But more recently, people have been very negative about them.  To understand whether push notifications are necessary on Buste, I launched a corresponding survey.  Already a few days have passed, but there are first results: <br><br> <a href="http://boosta.ru/%3Fattachment_id%3D3236" rel="attachment wp-att-3236"><img title="How Hotjar helps increase conversions (Service Overview and 3 Case Studies)" src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/megamozg/post_images/ee1/f24/7e9/ee1f247e958fbf3f30b4412e29dde970.jpg" alt="  Hotjar    (   3 )" width="730" height="217"></a> <br><br> <a href="http://boosta.ru/%3Fattachment_id%3D3237" rel="attachment wp-att-3237"><img title="How Hotjar helps increase conversions (Service Overview and 3 Case Studies)" src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/megamozg/post_images/961/33d/f71/96133df71c26aeeb71457896a316cb0e.jpg" alt="  Hotjar    (   3 )" width="730" height="240"></a> <br><br>  Here are the results in such a convenient form.  A week or two more and it will be possible to draw conclusions, and after that it‚Äôs decided whether to implement push notifications on Buste or not. <br><br>  All according to the rules of Data Driven Marketing. <br><br>  I tried many polling services.  And, in my opinion, this is the best, simple and convenient.  The survey is created in 2 minutes, perfectly customizes the site, it is easy to target and runs in one click.  Just perfect! <br><br>  If you want to consider other options, here is a very good <a href="http://boosta.ru/services/user-surveys/">selection of services for user surveys</a> . <br><h2>  7. Search for testers </h2><br><img title="How Hotjar helps increase conversions (Service Overview and 3 Case Studies)" src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/megamozg/post_images/656/aa6/fcc/656aa6fcc370e7748be34911a1ac644a.png" alt="  Hotjar    (   3 )" width="689" height="501"><br><br>  What this feature does: <br><br>  Directly on the site you can display pop-ups (in the same form as embedded polls) and through them look for users who will test your site. <br><br>  User testing is now very popular.  And abroad, it costs a lot of money.  We also have a service like Askusers.ru, which can be used for the same purposes. <br><br>  In general, it is difficult for me to comment on the last function, as I have never used it.  It is even interesting how often Hotjar customers use it compared to the rest of the functionality. <br><br>  This is all that concerns the description of the service <a href="https://www.hotjar.com/r/r8c63">Hotjar</a> .  As promised, finally, a good case for using the service to increase conversion on the site. <br><br>  I advise you to read - <a href="http://boosta.ru/ab-testirovanie/cases/6-kejsov-uvelicheniya-konversii-ot-kompanii-fiverr/">6 cases increase the conversion from the company Fiverr</a> <br><br><h2>  How to increase conversion from 22 to 33% in the online store of children's trampolines using scroll tracking </h2><br>  Foreword: Trampoline Plezier is an online store where you can buy children's trampolines (on the back yard of your house, for example, so that your child could play). <br><br>  The founder of the company Hans van Leersum, even at the very start, when he studied the target audience, realized that customers really lack information on how and where to install the trampoline.  They were also tormented by questions about how to "fit" the trampoline under the appearance of the territory, so that everything was beautiful, so to speak. <br><br>  A logical conclusion suggests itself: the one who can solve all these problems (to make the process of buying and installing the product as simple and convenient for the client as possible) will receive loyal customers. <br><br>  Loyal clients for business is a simple paradise.  They are more likely to return for a second purchase.  When their friend / colleague asks where it is better to buy such a trampoline, they first of all will advise you. <br><br>  The value is obvious. <br><br>  Based on this information, the founder of the online store has created a blog (yes, content marketing is conquering the world).  All blog content was aimed at dispelling all doubts, solving all problems of potential and current clients. <br><br>  In addition, each article in the blog had STA buttons that lead directly to the online store.  This is how the process of lead generation through content marketing worked. <br><br>  But, not everything was done correctly.  Namely - the CTA button, leading to the online store, was at the very bottom of the article. <br><br>  Already guessed what the problem was? <br><br>  Most people do not read articles completely.  On <a href="http://boosta.ru/">my site,</a> on average, 23-25% of all visitors read articles to the very end. <br><br>  What did this mean for Hans? <br><br>  Only part of the blog visitors knew about the presence of a button to go to the online store.  Thus, every day he lost potential customers. <br><br>  Let's look at the scroll map (Scroll Tracking): <br><br><img title="How Hotjar helps increase conversions (Service Overview and 3 Case Studies)" src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/megamozg/post_images/16c/9e8/c5d/16c9e8c5d7899a4207c7a9250faca40c.png" alt="  Hotjar    (   3 )" width="730" height="341"><br><br>  As seen in the image, only 46.2% of visitors saw the button.  And this is a very good indicator.  Not every blog has such a reading audience.  However, the business is no better.  54% of visitors still did not even see this button.  To be precise, it‚Äôs 13,000 visitors per month. <br><br>  If we imagine that at least 1% of them managed to convert to the buyer, then the figure is solid (taking into account the average bill of trampolines).  And, as can be seen below on the map of clicks, visitors are actively pressing the button. <br><br><img title="How Hotjar helps increase conversions (Service Overview and 3 Case Studies)" src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/megamozg/post_images/527/619/edf/527619edf12be0b0f057162b35562396.png" alt="  Hotjar    (   3 )" width="730" height="423"><br><br>  If more than half of visitors do not reach the right place, then how to solve this problem? <br><br>  Everything is obvious simply - duplicate the button at the beginning of the article.  Let the one who grabs the first few paragraphs immediately goes and buys.  And those who need more information to make a decision will do it at the very end. <br><br>  Here's how the beginning of the article looked like before adding an extra button: <br><br><img title="How Hotjar helps increase conversions (Service Overview and 3 Case Studies)" src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/megamozg/post_images/c1c/51d/450/c1c51d450d0072d60b7a63848f1e4d15.png" alt="  Hotjar    (   3 )" width="730" height="332"><br><br>  After adding a button: <br><br><img title="How Hotjar helps increase conversions (Service Overview and 3 Case Studies)" src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/megamozg/post_images/25d/cf1/198/25dcf119887c0db0c1bcd2dd4bc434bc.png" alt="  Hotjar    (   3 )" width="730" height="424"><br><br>  This is incredibly simple.  Even I with my zero skills HTML / CSS will fill in such a button in 1 minute on the site.  And the result was incredibly steep - the transitions on the button increased from 21.8% to 33.02%.  This is 50% more. <br><br>  Accordingly, the potential revenue from content marketing, due to the addition of one button, could immediately increase by 50%. <br><br>  This is the case when you do not need to invent something difficult.  The solution lay right on the surface, and you just had to analyze the scrolling and clicks map. <br><h2>  Unbounce Case: Not all logical things should increase conversion </h2><br>  Unbounce is the most popular service for creating landing pages.  They are very actively promoting the topic of increasing conversion, A / B testing, UX / UI, since all this is important for their customers - the creators of the landing pages. <br><br>  Accordingly, the entire team that works on the service is very much driven by these issues.  When they were joined by Michael Agard (conversion increase expert), he immediately set about improving the interface. <br><br>  One of the important pages in the sales funnel is entering billing information.  Initially, billing information (country, city, address, ZIP code) needed to be entered manually.  Michael considered that some of the users fell off here and suggested making an address selection and automatic entry (as was done on many large sites). <br><br> <a href="http://boosta.ru/%3Fattachment_id%3D3396" rel="attachment wp-att-3396"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/megamozg/post_images/cf7/4ec/031/cf74ec031c17d16463320f9775742228.jpg" alt="How the Hotjar service helps increase conversions (Service Overview and 1 Case)" width="775" height="578"></a> <br><br>  The developers of Unbounce quickly solved this problem and now each user could choose his address, after which all fields were filled in automatically.  The guys did some user tests, everyone liked the new feature, the time for filling decreased.  Everything is super at first glance. <br><br>  When a new feature was laid out for all users and they began to look at the recordings of sessions, it turned out that in this particular place users got stuck.  They didn't need auto-complete.  Many still copy-paste entered their address.  Others generally manually entered each field, and automatic substitution only hindered (I know for myself that sometimes it substitutes old data and constantly has to change some fields. Personally, it doesn‚Äôt bother me much, because the whole filling process is simplified, but judging by Unbounce experience - it has negative consequences). <br><br>  This is an example of a situation where things that are logical for us turn out to be ineffective.  In general, this is one of the biggest mistakes designers, internet marketers, when they are guided by their own taste, experience, and not by the target audience. <br><br>  By the way, this is not the only case when Hotjar helped the guys from Unbounce improve service.  Session recordings, as I said above when describing the service, help to find the bugs that users face very well. <br><br>  Unbounce has a very good example in this regard.  Looking through the records, they noticed a user who wanted to pay a tariff of $ 2000, but simply could not do it because of one mistake. <br><br>  After viewing the record, first, the guys found out who exactly could not pay and contacted him personally.  And, secondly, they understood what mistake can arise in the process of payment, and where they could lose real clients before. <br><br>  Just like that, Hotjar helps solve problems with an increase in conversion.  By the way, as I wrote above, as an alternative to Hotjar, you can use the Yandex.Metrica functional. <br><br>  I hope the review of this service has been useful for you.  And, even if you do not plan to use <a href="https://www.hotjar.com/r/r8c63">Hotjar</a> , most of the functions described are in other services (for example, in Yandex.Metrica).  So try using them to increase conversions on your site. <br>  If you want your friends and colleagues to know more about the increase in conversion, share this article on social networks.  They will be grateful for that.  And I even more so! </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/299134/">https://habr.com/ru/post/299134/</a></p>
