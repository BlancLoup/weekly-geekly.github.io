  <section class="page js-page"><h1>ValueHost is dead, but alive - UNIQUE INDEX problems</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Just yesterday, we mistakenly on the website <a href="http://www.hostingrate.ru/">www.hostingrate.ru</a> published an extract from the <a href="http://www.hostingrate.ru/">Incorporation</a> about the company Web Web Hosting CJSC, according to which Web Web Hosting CJSC was liquidated as early as 2007 and cannot carry out commercial activities, have licenses, etc. . <br><br>  On Habr√©, this information was deleted, and in vain, since the duplicate on this topic has been developed and managed to get to the truth, but you could do it here.  In addition, for the time while this news was hanging - it was not sickly ottirazhiroval on an Internet.  We do not need such a PR, and so Valuehost - it needs even less.  Therefore, I would like to publish a refutation-investigation of this fact. <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  The bottom line is that Web Hosting CJSC is alive and well, no one has eliminated it.  But at the same time, we did not lie and laid out a document on the liquidation of Web Web Hosting CJSC, obtained from the tax.  An even bigger joke is that the tax has not lied about giving information about liquidation.

      <br>
      The fact is that in the tax base there are two Web Web Hosting companies with one TIN and two OGRN, this is impossible but this is a fact. <br><br>  Who does not know, OGRN - is a unique number that allows you to personalize a particular company and select it among others with the same name or even address. <br><br>  Our problem is that there is Web Web Hosting CJSC which has been liquidated: <br><br>  <a href="http://egrul.nalog.ru/fns/fns.php%3Fnum%3D1027810333352">egrul.nalog.ru/fns/fns.php?num=1027810333352</a> <br><br>  And this, without going into details, is enough to know about the uniqueness of the TIN and OGRN for a particular company to say that Web Web Hosting CJSC has been liquidated, which in fact was done by us. <br><br>  But at the same time, we also have a second Web Hosting CJSC from other OGRNs.  The presence of a second OGRN for the same company is theoretically impossible, but in practice it turned out to be quite acceptable. <br><br>  <a href="http://egrul.nalog.ru/fns/fns.php%3Fnum%3D1027810333484">egrul.nalog.ru/fns/fns.php?num=1027810333484</a> <br><br>  The last digit of the OGRN is a checksum, which means the difference between the codes is only 13 (102781033348-102781033335).  If we consider that the OGRN is a single numbering throughout Russia, then the difference in ID is 13 is insignificant, especially in the period when this number was assigned. <br><br>  It was in 2002, and personally I have a great suspicion that someone from the processing of documents conditionally ‚Äúpressed F5‚Äù and re-sent the form with the data, then there was probably no double-post checking and the tax clerk who sent the data twice printed the second , having handed over to the hands of Web-Hosting CJSC, the PSRN 1027810333352 with which they work to this day. <br><br>  04/02/2007 judging by the second statement of Web Web Hosting CJSC, they decided to make some changes, which we will find out on Monday, but this is absolutely not important. <br><br>  The clerk who processed the documents noticed that in 2002 there was a jamb and it needed to be fixed.  Hardly the tax clerks have root rights to a single database and they clearly had to solve the problem with regular tools.  The only way to correct the mistake was to declare the ‚Äútwin brother‚Äù invalid by a decision of the Federal Tax Service, which was done, and at the same time several papers on the liquidation of the company were sent to other bodies, why the actual liquidation records are dated May 17, 2007 and May 28, 2007 in the first statement. <br><br>  In 2010, we make a request for Web Web Hosting.  It is difficult to say whether the clerk chooses an extract with his hands or a script knowing that the OGRN is unique takes the first available one - but we get an extract from the OGRN 1027810333484, according to the very OGRN which was eliminated.  That is, to the request ‚ÄúWho is such a ValueHost‚Äù we receive an official response from the tax ‚ÄúEnterprise liquidated in 2007‚Äù. <br><br>  Who is guilty?  Initially, the programmer is to blame for not making the INN, KPP fields in the database unique and not considering the clerk‚Äôs fool proof. <br><br>  What to do? <br><br>  Tax - manually delete this entry to no longer issue such statements. <br><br>  Web Web Hosting CJSC is to kick the tax so that they do it, and bothering to sue taxes for several years as a ‚Äúsmall‚Äù moral compensation, since with such a tax jamb you can safely question the demands of paying taxes in court. <br><br>  To us - to make a repeated request for an extract having become attached to the second OGRN with which CJSC has worked all its life, and to publish a refutation, the second we have already done. <br><br>  The bottom line is that Valuehost has no registration problems.  It remains for us to apologize to Web Hosting CJSC. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/91891/">https://habr.com/ru/post/91891/</a></p>
