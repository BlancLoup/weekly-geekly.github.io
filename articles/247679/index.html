I didn‚Äôt play with it for long, recorded up to 1 minute of sound from a microphone (then the recording was interrupted) and listened to the received.  And he converted the sounds from one quality to another. <br><br>  The second sound editor I saw was <b>Cool Edit Pro 2000</b> (now called Adobe Audition).  But when I rummaged in it enough - I was upset, this thing is called the "sound editor", but it only edits the sound.  It is impossible to write music from scratch.  In her successor - Adobe Audition, however, later they added a system of tracks into which you can loop and make music from them.

      Then I also saw <b>Cakewalk Pro Audio</b> (Cakewalk Sonar), <b>Fruity Loops</b> , <b>Sound Forge</b> , etc. <br><br>  But since 1998-2000, the desire to create sound and insert any notes into it in any place in time has been lurking in me.  And to do it both in a simple mode (‚Äúput that note back there‚Äù), and in a more complicated one (‚Äúwe will press this chord, we will play in this style, then another chord, we will play it in a different style‚Äù). <br><br>  And more than a year ago, in December 2013, I started making this editor. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  And he began to do it in the framework of the project PaintCAD 4Windows, which has long been able to make AVI films from drawn frames, but the resulting AVI is a silent movie, without sound.  Therefore, the paintkad really needed the ability to create WAV files from scratch or edit others, collecting the voice acting for AVI from them.  Well, where the creation of sound files - there and writing music nearby. <br><br>  To get to Qmpot (read ‚Äúkumpot‚Äù) - you need to start the paintkad: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/e4d/b88/bdc/e4db88bdc4264e4091cbfea796b2b528.png"><br><br>  So what is next: <br>  - or press <b>Ctrl + Q</b> ; <br>  - or press <b>0 (zero)</b> on the keyboard and select <b>‚ÄúExtra‚Äù in the ‚ÄúQmpot Sound Editor‚Äù menu</b> : <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/8a9/b7f/aff/8a9b7fafff3544659a02d6fccb61518e.png"><br><br>  The opened Qmpot will be empty. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/7c3/006/fba/7c3006fbab9c4587ade1f63b996ebaba.png"><br><br>  <b>And though:</b> <br>  - in it, you can create a new sound (via <b>‚ÄúCreate (Ctrl + N)‚Äù</b> ), <br>  - you can upload WAV files (via <b>"Open (Ctrl + O)"</b> ), <br>  - you can climb the cursor (from the keyboard) on the sound, accelerating movement 10 times (if you hold down <b>Shift</b> ) or 100 times (if you hold down <b>Ctrl + Shift</b> ), <br>  - you can scale the sound using <b>Ctrl + Plus</b> and <b>Ctrl + Minus</b> , <br>  - you can move the cursor to a specific or random place by the button <b>‚ÄúGo (Ctrl + G)‚Äù</b> <br>  - it is possible to select sound fragments by a space (or by the button <b>‚ÄúSelect (Space)‚Äù</b> ) <br>  - you can turn on <b>Ctrl + I</b> information about the counts under the cursor (amplitude and derivative) and under the borders of the selection (difference amplitudes and derivatives, to create your own loop-s) <br>  - you can cut, copy, paste, delete selected <b>(Ctrl + X, Ctrl + C, Ctrl + V, Del)</b> <br>  - you can press <b>"Commands (Ctrl + K)"</b> and manually edit the amplitude of the samples, change the selection border, change the length of the array and sound, transpose the sound <br>  - you can click <b>"Effects (Ctrl + E)"</b> and apply various effects to the selected sound fragment (from a simple change in volume to moving the sound source in space relative to the listener), <br>  - you can save the edited sound to a WAV file (via <b>‚ÄúSave (Ctrl + S)‚Äù</b> ), <br>  <b>This is not the main thing.</b> <br><br><h4>  Music programming </h4><br>  The main thing begins if you click the <b>"Program (F3)"</b> button and then the edit field of the QMP programs (scripts) opens: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/c40/c19/4ff/c40c194ff87a475a91bbdd2572fee9c7.png"><br><br>  Comments in this field are written with a double slash at the beginning.  It is convenient to tag them with couplets / choruses and other parts of music. <br><br>  One of the commands already entered in the field is <b>X.</b>  Place the cursor on it and read under the program text field <b>‚ÄúComplete execution‚Äù</b> and <b>‚ÄúX (without parameters)‚Äù</b> .  For any command under the cursor, its purpose and syntax are displayed here: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/094/bc1/b51/094bc1b5180b4ed28df1e5b6ca6db0ff.png"><br><br>  Place the cursor between the comment and the X command. Click the <b>"Command (Shift + F3)"</b> button to the right of the program entry field.  Select <b>"N - new sound"</b> , and then <b>"Mono sound 16 bit</b> . <b>"</b>  A line will appear in the program: <br><br>  <b>N 11025,16,1,5S</b> <br><br>  it means "to create a new empty sound with a sampling frequency of 11025 Hz, a sound depth of 16 bits, one channel and a length of 5 seconds." <br><br>  The menu by the <b>‚ÄúCommand (Shift + F3)‚Äù</b> button allows you to insert any commands into the program, if you are too lazy to watch the help, and you forgot the name of the command. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/041/ca4/a10/041ca4a10cf44ad0b465b9dfb5428251.png"><br><br>  Also, all the teams with examples and pictures can be viewed if you press F1 in the paintkad or kumpot and select the <b>Extra section - ‚ÄúQmpot Sound Editor‚Äù - ‚ÄúCommand List‚Äù</b> . <br><br>  Add the following command after the N command: <br><br>  <b>LT 1,11025,16,1,0.5,0.5</b> <br><br>  it means ‚Äúload the triangular / sawtooth wave into instrument number 1 with the parameters sampling rate of 11025 Hz, 16 bits, 1 channel, 50% amplitude from the maximum and 50% filling‚Äù. <br><br>  ‚ÄúFilling‚Äù for a triangular wave is its ‚Äúsawtooth‚Äù.  Filling 50% (0.5) is a pure triangular signal (picture in the middle): <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/fa2/4ad/a21/fa24ada21ddc4358ad7bd3465e37a78a.png"><br><br>  The sine wave - sounds very soft, triangular - harder, sawtooth - even harder, and rectangular - the hardest.  Any of these signals, as well as the noise signal, can be loaded as instruments: <b>LS</b> - sine, <b>LT</b> - triangle / sawtooth, <b>LR</b> - rectangular, <b>LN</b> - noise. <br><br>  Now we have 2 teams - the sound is created and the triangular wave is loaded as tool number 1. Add the first note.  To do this, after the LT command, insert the command: <br><br>  <b>PL 1,0,10,1S, 0</b> <br><br>  it means to record the number 1 instrument in both channels with the instrument (0 - both channels, 1 - left, 2 - right, because the sound is mono - then at 0 all the same, only the first channel will sound), at an offset of 10 samples from the beginning of the sound, lasting 1 second, and the tone of the note 0 (Up to the 4th octave, C4). <br><br>  The tone of the note is the shift in semitones relative to the original tone of the instrument.  Here in the picture above the piano keyboard shows the note numbers: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/12c/139/0cd/12c1390cd9104d8e8925b47240f241ef.png"><br><br>  Those.  if you want a note Do - put 0, want Re - put 2, want Mi - put 3, want Do up an octave higher - put 12, etc. <br><br>  Click the <b>‚ÄúStart (Shift + F5)‚Äù</b> button to the right of the program entry field (or <b>Shift + F5</b> on the keyboard).  The program will be launched and will issue a "result". <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/479/357/22f/47935722fd0941f2b981f8021567d88c.png"><br><br>  Click below on the <b>Play / Pause (F5)</b> panel (or simply <b>F5</b> on the keyboard) and listen to it (it will be 1 second with a note and 4 seconds of silence, since the five-second sound length is specified in the N command). <br><br>  Let's write ditties in minor.  These are chords Dm, Am, E, Am.  In accordance with the image of the piano keyboard at the top and the numbers of notes on it: <br>  Dm is three notes D4, F4, A4, i.e.  in numbers of notes it is 2,5,9. <br>  Am is the notes of A3, C4, E4, in the rooms it is -3.0,4. <br>  E is E3, G # 3, B3, in numbers it is -8, -4, -1. <br><br>  Let's change the length of the sound in the N command for 9 seconds (so that the ditties get in).  And with PL commands we fill these chords with these note numbers, each note will be 0.5 seconds long: <br>  - the first three notes from DM with an offset of 0 seconds and 1 second (twice), <br>  - the second three notes from Am with an offset of 2 seconds and 3 seconds (twice), <br>  - the third three notes from E with an offset of 4 seconds and 5 seconds (twice), <br>  - the last three notes from Am with an offset of 6 seconds and 7 seconds (twice). <br><br>  We get (copy this script and paste it into the program field instead of what was there): <br><br><pre><code class="cs hljs"><span class="hljs-comment"><span class="hljs-comment">//  QMP- N 11025,16,1,9S LT 1,11025,16,1,0.5,0.5 //Dm 2,5,9 PL 1,0,0S,0.5S,2 PL 1,0,0S,0.5S,5 PL 1,0,0S,0.5S,9 PL 1,0,1S,0.5S,2 PL 1,0,1S,0.5S,5 PL 1,0,1S,0.5S,9 //Am -3,0,4 PL 1,0,2S,0.5S,-3 PL 1,0,2S,0.5S,0 PL 1,0,2S,0.5S,4 PL 1,0,3S,0.5S,-3 PL 1,0,3S,0.5S,0 PL 1,0,3S,0.5S,4 //E -8,-4,-1 PL 1,0,4S,0.5S,-8 PL 1,0,4S,0.5S,-4 PL 1,0,4S,0.5S,-1 PL 1,0,5S,0.5S,-8 PL 1,0,5S,0.5S,-4 PL 1,0,5S,0.5S,-1 //Am -3,0,4 PL 1,0,6S,0.5S,-3 PL 1,0,6S,0.5S,0 PL 1,0,6S,0.5S,4 PL 1,0,7S,0.5S,-3 PL 1,0,7S,0.5S,0 PL 1,0,7S,0.5S,4 X</span></span></code> </pre> <br>  Click the <b>‚ÄúStart (Shift + F5)‚Äù</b> button to the right of the program entry field (or <b>Shift + F5</b> on the keyboard).

And when there will be enough commands - we copy them by Ctrl + C, close the Input of notes by Esc and paste the received commands into the program. <br><br>  If you are too lazy to increase the offset each time, press the <b>‚ÄúAuto + (Ctrl + P)‚Äù</b> button and then after each addition of notes by Ctrl + Enter, the offset will increase by itself. <br><br>  You can also set the <b>‚ÄúShift‚Äù</b> parameter - and the notes will not be inserted all by one offset, but each with this shift relative to the previous one, as if the pianist does not instantly press all the keys, but with delays. <br><br><h4>  Game Styles and Test Teams </h4><br>  There are two buttons above the program field in ‚ÄúEntering Notes‚Äù: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/684/bba/b7b/684bbab7bbe8408c8863652c68789cfc.png"><br><br>  With the button <b>‚ÄúTest commands (Ctrl + U)‚Äù</b> you can listen to the commands entered on the triangular wave for the piano / guitar and on the noise drums for the drum nets, without leaving the ‚ÄúPutting in notes‚Äù. <br><br>  You can select specific game styles using the <b>‚ÄúGame Style (Ctrl + B)‚Äù</b> button.  For piano, these are piano styles, for guitar, guitar, and for drums, these are built-in rhythms (rock, hip hop, etc.).  You can also set your own style. <br><br>  The current game style is displayed under the ‚ÄúGame Style‚Äù button.  In the default piano, this is the ‚ÄúPlay All‚Äù style.  It looks like an A-1D. <br><br>  Piano styles are encoded with commands and digits written with a dash: <br>  <b>A</b> - play all the notes at the same time; <br>  <b>Sets of numbers 1-9</b> - play the specified note from a clamped chord (if three notes are clamped, then 1 will play the first note, 2 - the second, 3 - the third, 13 - the first and the third simultaneously, 4 - will not play anything, because only three clamped); <br>  <b>Steps D</b> - the delay between the previous notes and the next in shares of the ‚Äústeps‚Äù of the ‚ÄúPitch‚Äù parameter from the bottom of the window, the length of the previous notes being determined by the ‚ÄúLength‚Äù parameter from the bottom of the window; <br>  <b>StepsL</b> ‚Äî The delay between the previous notes and the next ‚Äústeps‚Äù of the ‚ÄúPitch‚Äù parameter from the bottom of the window, with the length of the previous notes being equal to this delay (the notes stretch to the next notes). <br><br>  For example, the aforementioned ‚ÄúPlay All‚Äù style is A-1D, where A is to lose everything, 1D is to wait for one Step. <br><br>  And the ‚ÄúPairs (1 Step)‚Äù style is encoded as 2-0.25L-34-0.25L-1-0.25L-34-0.25L, which means: <br>  2-0.25L: 2 a note clamped in a chord is played a quarter of a step; <br>  34-0.25L: 3 and 4 a note clamped in a chord is played a quarter of a Step; <br>  1-0.25L: 1 note clamped in a chord is played quarter of a step; <br>  34-0.25L: 3 and 4 a note clamped in a chord is played a quarter of a step. <br>  As a result, the whole Step is filled with notes. <br><br>  Thus, choosing the ‚ÄúCouples (1 step)‚Äù style and holding a 4 note chord, you can use Ctrl + Enter to receive commands of the whole musical phrase 2-34-1-34 with shifts in time, and not just a chord. <br><br><h4>  Entering notes with playing style (general algorithm) </h4><br>  1) Use the <b>‚ÄúNumber (Ctrl + I)‚Äù</b> button to specify the number of the tool that will be used in QMP commands; <br>  2) Using the <b>‚ÄúClear (Ctrl + X)‚Äù</b> button <b>,</b> clear the previous ‚Äúnote input‚Äù program (if it was entered before); <br>  3) Using the <b>‚ÄúStep (Ctrl + S)‚Äù</b> button <b>,</b> specify the step length in ms; <br>  4) Using the <b>‚ÄúOffset (Ctrl + A)‚Äù</b> button <b>,</b> set the initial offset to 0 ms (or another, if you want to set notes not from the beginning of the melody); <br>  5) Reset previously pressed notes on the button <b>‚ÄúReset keys (Ctrl + K)‚Äù</b> and hold down the next chord of 4 notes by moving the cursor and pressing the <b>‚ÄúSelect (Space)‚Äù</b> button; <br>  6) By the button <b>‚ÄúAdd (Ctrl + ENTER)‚Äù</b> ‚Äúplay‚Äù the clamped chord with the chosen style of play (the game teams will be added to the QMP program in the text field on the right); <br>  7) Increase the offset by one step with the <b>"+"</b> button <b>(Ctrl + Plus)</b> ; <br>  8) If you also need to enter other chords of the melody, go to step 5 to enter the next chord. <br>  9) Press <b>"Test commands (Ctrl + U)"</b> to listen to the received melody on a triangular signal; <br>  10) Click <b>"Copy (Ctrl + C)"</b> to copy QMP commands, exit the "Enter Notes" by <b>ESC</b> , paste the commands into the QMP program in the main window Qmpot; <br><br>  <b>Advice:</b> if you pre-enable the mode by the ‚ÄúAuto + (Ctrl + P)‚Äù button, then step 7 will not be required, the offset will automatically increase by the required number of steps after each addition of notes by the ‚ÄúAdd (Ctrl + ENTER)‚Äù button. <br><br>  Other styles can take more than one step, but more, for example, the predefined ‚ÄúBrute force (2 steps)‚Äù style uses 8 iterations of 0.25 steps (that is, it takes 2 steps).  Then, when manually changing the offset, it is necessary after ‚ÄúAdd (Ctrl + ENTER)‚Äù to increase the offset by 2 steps (with the <b>‚Äú+‚Äù</b> button <b>(Ctrl + Plus)</b> ).  In the case of an auto-increment offset ( <b>‚ÄúAuto + (Ctrl + P)‚Äù</b> ), the required number of steps will be automatically added to the offset. <br><br>  Also in the game style selection menu, using the <b>‚ÄúGame Style (Ctrl + B)‚Äù</b> button <b>,</b> you can manually enter your game styles.  In the same menu, you can load / save to QPS (Qmpot Piano Style) files with the style of the game and the current clamped chord on the piano. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/347/809/2f6/3478092f616048aab4213754ff15b9fc.png"><br><br><h4>  Music Input: Six String Guitar </h4><br>  To go to the guitar, press the button <b>‚ÄúTool (Ctrl + G)‚Äù</b> at the bottom of the panel. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/e01/10c/928/e0110c928a1342589a5877e8cb9ef5ad.png"><br><br>  Here, like the piano, you can run the cursor on the fingerboard and clamp the strings.  An unstressed string does not participate in the chord, so, for example, for the simple A-minor Am it is necessary to clamp everything as usual, and the free strings are in a zero fret, and then by Ctrl + Enter the whole chord will be thrown into the program: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/818/184/53e/81818453e54743cf8b125c998791ee5f.png"><br><br>  Here, too, you can play in different styles: normal battle, tweaks, fights. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/79a/158/1e6/79a1581e623d4a9599f2e931f3014138.png"><br><br><h4>  Putting Notes: Drum Grid </h4><br>  To go to the guitar, press the button <b>‚ÄúTool (Ctrl + G)‚Äù</b> at the bottom of the panel again. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/1ac/c17/e71/1acc17e71ee64b1f9fc2663b158b519f.png"><br><br>  The classic mesh that is used in Cakewalk, Fruity Loops and much more.  Only vertically is not the notes of the piano, but the numbers of the drums. <br><br>  And the horizontal time is within the selected size by the button <b>"Size (Ctrl + E)"</b> .  For example, if the selected size is 8/4, the grid will look as shown in the screenshot above - 8 columns, divided into groups of 4 columns. <br><br>  Put the notes on the reels like this: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/016/30b/a47/01630ba4784e43a8befb654a56258d26.png"><br><br>  Click <b>‚ÄúSound (ENTER)‚Äù</b> (or just <b>Enter</b> ) to listen to the rhythm in MIDI.  He will be played twice to evaluate the docking of the rhythm with himself. <br><br>  Click <b>‚ÄúAdd (CTRL + ENTER)‚Äù</b> (or just <b>Ctrl + Enter</b> ) to throw off the notes of the rhythm in the program field.  Pressing the <b>"Command Test (Ctrl + U)"</b> button will lose the rhythm from the program field on the noise drums. <br><br>  In order to use the rhythm commands received in this way in a QMP program, you must already load 9 instruments (9 different drums) in this QMP program. <br><br>  Therefore, in the main Qmpot window in the menu by the ‚ÄúCommand (Shift + F3)‚Äù button there is a call for ‚Äúnoise drums‚Äù - drums on noise signals.  It is enough to choose the number of the starting drum (if 1 - then they will take the instrument numbers from 1 to 9, if 20 - then from 20 to 28, etc.) and digit capacity (8 or 16 bits) and you will have them in the program.  For example, a program with the above-recited rhythm and noise drums: <br><br><pre> <code class="cs hljs"><span class="hljs-comment"><span class="hljs-comment">//  QMP- N 11025,16,1,4S // //bass LN 1,44100,16,1,0.5,0.001S ST 1,-66 SF 1,0.001S,0.032S //acoustic snare LN 2,44100,16,1,0.5,0.008S ST 2,-48 SF 2,0.001S,0.128S //clap LN 3,44100,16,1,0.5,0.004S ST 3,-36 SF 3,0.001S,0.032S //electric snare LN 4,44100,16,1,0.5,0.008S ST 4,-40 SF 4,0.001S,0.064S //closed hi-hat LN 5,44100,16,1,0.2,0.012S SF 5,0.001S,0.011S //open hi-hat LN 6,44100,16,1,0.3,0.24S SF 6,0.01S,0.23S //tomtom LN 7,44100,16,1,0.5,0.0015S ST 7,-60 SF 7,0.001S,0.048S //crash LN 8,44100,16,1,0.5,0.24S ST 8,-6 SF 8,0.01S,0.33S //ride LN 9,44100,16,1,0.3,0.30S ST 9,-2 SF 9,0.03S,0.27S //  P 1,0,0S,0 P 1,0,1S,0 P 2,0,0.5S,0 P 2,0,1.5S,0 P 5,0,0.25S,0 P 5,0,0.75S,0 P 5,0,1.25S,0 P 5,0,1.75S,0 P 6,0,1.75S,0 P 1,0,2S,0 P 1,0,3S,0 P 2,0,2.5S,0 P 2,0,3.5S,0 P 5,0,2.25S,0 P 5,0,2.75S,0 P 5,0,3.25S,0 P 5,0,3.75S,0 P 6,0,3.75S,0 X</span></span></code> </pre><br>  In the <b>‚ÄúGame Style (Ctrl + B)‚Äù</b> menu <b>,</b> you can choose different preset rhythms. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/842/7b5/2e3/8427b52e357745588ea0392812e8d660.png"><br><br>  The ‚Äú123456789- (required delay) D‚Äù style line is automatically set depending on the current size selected by the <b>‚ÄúSize (Ctrl + E)‚Äù</b> button. <br><br><h4>  Entering music: playing on a PC keyboard </h4><br>  When the Piano or Six-String Guitar instruments are included in the ‚ÄúEntering Notes‚Äù, you can play on the physical keyboard of a computer like a piano keyboard. <br><br>  The main part of the keyboard is two rows of keys: <br>  <b>Top row -WE-TYU-OP-]</b> - black keys, notes Do #, D #, Fa #, Sol #, Aa #, Do #, D #, Fa #. <br>  <b>Bottom row ASDFGHJKL; '</b>  - white keys, notes of Do, D, Mi, Fa, Sol, La, Xi, Do, D, Mi, Fa. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/f7e/e5f/d27/f7ee5fd27986451a891d38ac2098f9c6.png"><br><br>  This part of the keyboard plays notes, starting with the octave, in which the cursor is currently located.  Those.  By moving the cursor on the virtual piano keyboard to higher octaves in tone, you can get a higher sound from the physical keyboard.  At the fretboard, this system also works ‚Äî on higher-pitched strings and on distant frets ‚Äî a higher-pitched notes from the physical keyboard. <br><br>  Sometimes it is convenient to play / record bass accompaniment with the melody, therefore: <br>  - below the "bottom row" there is a row of keys <b>ZXC ... &lt;&gt;?</b>  - it plays the role of white piano keys, but an octave below the main part of the keyboard. <br>  - similarly, there are a number of <b>123</b> keys above the ‚Äútop row‚Äù <b>...) - =</b> - it plays the role of black piano keys, but an octave lower than the main part of the keyboard. <br><br>  Therefore, it is recommended to play ASDF ... and QWER ... melody rows, and ZXCV ... and 1234 ... bass accompaniment to it.  For example, A is the note Do, Z is the note Do one octave lower. <br><br>  With the current Piano tool, all the keys pressed on the physical keyboard are displayed on the virtual keyboard in the Note Entry window. <br><br><h4>  Entering music: recording a game on a PC keyboard </h4><br>  By the <b>‚ÄúRecord (Ctrl + R)‚Äù</b> button you can turn on / off the recording mode, then everything played will be added as QMP commands in the program field.  In this case, the first pressed note will receive an offset of 0 seconds, the remaining notes will be recorded relative to the moment when the first note was pressed. <br><br>  To record the offset and duration of the notes were aligned in time - use quantization: <br>  1) Set the <b>Tempo (Ctrl + T)</b> button to the required tempo of the game, you can also set up and turn on the metronome (MIDI or Video) to listen to the tempo of the game and even leave it on while recording (warning: on weak computers, the MIDI metronome sound can stray and lay, then use the video metronome and watch the balls appear on the screen); <br>  2) Press the <b>‚ÄúQuant (Ctrl + F)‚Äù</b> button and enter, for example, 2. This means that the shifts and the duration of the notes will be a multiple of 1/2 of the duration of the tempo strike.  At a pace of 120 beats per minute, 1 beat of the tempo is 0.5 seconds, and 1/2 of the duration of the beat of the pace is 0.25 seconds, so all offsets and durations of recorded notes will be a multiple of 0.25 seconds. <br><br>  <b>Important:</b> modern features of the device of physical keyboards do not allow clamping a large number of keys simultaneously.  Therefore, be prepared to accept the fact that when playing / recording on the physical keyboard when you press more than 2 keys at the same time - some keystrokes can be skipped by the game / recording system.  This is normal.  It all depends on your keyboard, ideally - just try not to press more than 2 keys at the same time, then everything will be fine. <br><br><h4>  Entering notes: playing and recording drums on a PC keyboard </h4><br>  When the ‚ÄúDrum Grid‚Äù tool is turned on in ‚ÄúEntering Notes‚Äù, you can play on the physical keyboard of the computer like on all 9 reels in the grid and record this game using the <b>‚ÄúRecord (Ctrl + R)‚Äù</b> button.  Keys for playing / recording: <br><br>  <b>A number of keys ASDFGHJKL</b> - drums from 1 to 9. <br><br><h3>  Conclusion </h3><br>  In this article, the manual briefly describes the sound editor Qmpot.  More specifically, only the programming and the ‚ÄúEntry of Notes‚Äù system are described. <br><br>  In the help system (by the <b>F1</b> button in a paintkad or kumpot) in the section <b>‚ÄúExtra‚Äù - ‚ÄúQmpot Sound Editor‚Äù</b> you can find additional information not described in the article: <br>  - about the basics of sound editing (what is the sampling rate, bit depth, how sound is recorded in files, etc.), <br>  - about loading tools from INS + WAV files and simply from WAV samples, <br>  - about creating your own tools, <br>  - about searching and setting loop-a (loop, repeating part) in the tools you create, <br>  - on the extraction of finished instruments from SF2 / DLS sound banks, <br>  - applying effects in the Qmpot editor (filtering, noise reduction, reversing the sound, moving the sound source relative to the listener, taking into account the Doppler effect, etc.), <br>  - about recording sound from sound card inputs, from a webcam, etc., <br>  - and much more. <br><br>  In the Qmpot sound editor, using the methods described above, you can compose melodies, process sounds and even make voiceovers for movies and animations (AVI files) that you create in the paintcade. <br><br>  WAV dubbing can be attached to an AVI file in the Paintkad <b>Utilities</b> menu.  You can also extract the WAV voice acting from any AVI file: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/2ff/65b/6c7/2ff65b6c799b472c9371e0c48e725554.png"><br><br>  <b>Download PaintCAD 4Windows with Qmpot inside</b> <br>  You can follow the links (12.6 MB): <br>  <a href="">Rar</a> <b>:</b> <a href="">blackstrip.ru/pcw.rar</a> <br>  <b>ZIP:</b> <a href="">blackstrip.ru/pcw.zip</a> <br>  <b>SFX-EXE:</b> <a href="">blackstrip.ru/pcw.exe</a> <br><br>  Bonus melody for Qmpot for those who read the article to the end: <a href="http://blackstrip.ru/bonusmusic.txt">blackstrip.ru/bonusmusic.txt</a> (on noise drums and two triangular waves!). </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/247679/">https://habr.com/ru/post/247679/</a></p>
