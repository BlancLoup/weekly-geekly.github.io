About 600 people answered our questions. <br><br><img src="http://devbar.ru/habr/graph.png"><br><br>  The results were not shocking, but the numbers are an interesting thing.  We offer a look.

    <a name="habracut"></a><br><br><h2>  Age </h2><br>  This moment was one of the most interesting, for us personally. <br><br><img src="http://devbar.ru/habr/age.png"><br><br>  Basically - the audience is <s>friendly, purposeful</s> young.  This is not bad, because  the liver is still in condition, the fervor for holivars is at its peak.  And in general, they say (we don‚Äôt have a clue, they are still green) that it's about time for a lively entertainment. <br><br>  Well, a small part will tell us how they wrote microkernels in assembler and swear at 640 kilobytes. <br><br><h2>  Floor </h2><br>  Well, here without surprises. <br><br><img src="http://devbar.ru/habr/sex.png"><br><br>  What to do, such a profession.  But no one bothers to drag your soul mate to us and load with incomprehensible terms. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/840/8cf/0a9/8408cf0a9a1816e67c5b7721878293f4.jpg"></div><br><br><h2>  Kind of activity </h2><br><br><img src="http://devbar.ru/habr/job.png"><br><br>  In total, about 40% of potential visitors learn.  This is good, because, probably, it will be even more interesting to them to listen to the reports than to others.  There is also a possibility that the bar will become partly a place for a get-together of IT students (as at the beginning of the Social Network).  The rest work.  And 4 more people do not understand what. <br><br>  There was also an additional question ‚ÄúAre you connected to IT?‚Äù, But everything is expected here: <br><br><img src="http://devbar.ru/habr/it.png"><br><br>  There is an opinion that sooner or later 24 more people will be added to 491 people. <br><br>  <b>***</b> <br><br>  Then we had more general questions that reveal the preferences of the audience in terms of bars. <br><br><h2>  How often do you visit bars? </h2><br>  It was one of the most fundamental issues for a business plan, which helped to form a more or less clear picture of the premises, revenues and prospects.  Because the very first investor asked me a simple question: ‚ÄúDo the IT people drink?‚Äù.  ‚ÄúYes,‚Äù I replied, but it was necessary to back up the answer with numbers.  Here is what happened: <br><br><img src="http://devbar.ru/habr/visits.png"><br><br>  Firstly, even if half of the 40 people live with us, this is an excellent result.  Secondly, a stable audience of those who walk a couple of times a week and several times a month (which, by the way, is about the same) fully corresponds to our plans. <br><br>  ‚ÄúWould you be interested in visiting Devbar?‚Äù: <br><br><img src="http://devbar.ru/habr/interest.png"><br><br>  404 people have been waiting for a similar project for a long time, but it is likely that we will not find them. <br>  101 people, in principle, no matter where to go, but they will change their minds (if you know what I mean). <br><br><h2>  What kind of drinks do you usually order when visiting a bar? </h2><br><br><img src="http://devbar.ru/habr/drinks.png"><br><br>  We were pleased with the number of people leading a healthy lifestyle as well as those who are for diversity. <br>  Again, there were other answers: <br><br><ul><li>  <b>Coffee and teas</b> - a lot of answers </li><li>  <b>Pizza</b> - too many people say </li><li>  <b>I want a</b> caipirinha - I had to google it.  It turns out that "it is made of cachaasa, lime, ice and cane sugar."  OK. </li></ul><br><br><h2>  How do you feel about smoking in a bar?  (Caution) </h2><br>  One of the most discussed questions. <br><br>  In the questionnaire: <br><br><img src="http://devbar.ru/habr/smoking-2.png"><br><br>  In contact with: <br><br><img src="http://devbar.ru/habr/smoking-1.png"><br><br>  Apparently, it is necessary, nevertheless, to infringe the rights of smokers.  But the question remains open.  Probably we can organize two rooms. <br><br><h2>  How do you feel about holding IT-related events at the bar? </h2><br>  It was interesting to think about one of the main "chips" institutions. <br><br><img src="http://devbar.ru/habr/events.png"><br><br>  By the way, we have already received offers from more or less respected people.  Work in this direction will be very active. <br><br><h2>  What is your favorite place?  What do you like about him? </h2><br>  Spelling and stuff saved. <br><br><blockquote>  My favorite place is my mini office at home.  No normal places.  I am a designer, and the very first thing I do for design, usability ... institutions.  I do not drink, I do not smoke ... I work deleted.  Finding a place where you can sit quietly in the corner ‚Äúduzlya‚Äù Chinese teas, eat delicious ‚Äúbuns‚Äù, order essential for lunch and dinner, and not run into the rudeness of the staff taking up space with your laptop for the whole day, and finding a place where zones for smokers are clearly divided and ‚Äúfrom this God of people‚Äù is no longer realistic. </blockquote><br><blockquote>  In general, I am from MSC, but I will be in St. Petersburg with pleasure to look </blockquote><br><blockquote>  home - all amenities </blockquote><br><blockquote>  Cafe "Apple Pie".  You can quietly drink beer with friends, and you can order a cheap kettle of tea and sit for four hours, work.  Plus Yota catches, keep in mind the reception from the BS of different operators when choosing a place and finishing materials, and friends have already opened a cafe in Petrogradka - there was no connection - people turned around and left. </blockquote><br><blockquote>  Munich, there you can pobuhat. </blockquote><br><br><h2>  Bonus track: the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãa mini-debate </h2><br>  On the basis of holivars about smoking, an idea was born: Holywar corner.  In other words, debates on IT topics.  Examples: "Chrome" vs "Firefox", "Windows" vs "Mac" (oh), ".NET" vs "everything else".  How do you like the idea? <br><br><img src="http://devbar.ru/habr/debates.jpg"><br><br>  <b>***</b> <br><br>  So it goes.  Unobtrusively we remind you that we have a <a href="http://devbar.ru/">website</a> (for the time being just a promotional page), a <a href="http://vk.com/devbar">VK page</a> and a <a href="https://twitter.com/">Twitter</a> <a href="http://vk.com/devbar">page</a> .
