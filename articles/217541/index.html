I found one Victorian place and I want to show it to you.  This is a steampunk coffee house, Truth Coffee, where local IT professionals sometimes gather. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/5c3/06b/c7c/5c306bc7cb2fc46e65a8b5b12fb3d8da.jpg">

      And, of course, here you can just sit and use the free wifi.  In South Africa, you know, this is a bit stressful.  And, most importantly, there is a very interesting payment model.  I'll tell you now. <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  The first thing that catches your eye is the design: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/18a/5d7/1b9/18a5d71b97d28a1a3967abdd071b9d19.jpg"><br><br>  Funny tables (their edges are smooth, they do not cling at all - the plate is wide enough): <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/c5f/187/53a/c5f18753a0c4a00dff5e15e27fd634d9.jpg"><br><br>  Strange chairs: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/36c/fc6/3d5/36cfc63d5ddf03132dca26613fe4f57a.jpg"><br><br>  Now look at these vines hanging from above: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/302/68b/f47/30268bf47cef097c09d8d0627b3bcb94.jpg"><br><br>  These are power cords.  Very thoughtfully done - hang at a level just above a meter above the tables.  The connector is the local standard for the power grid. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/7cc/a3c/578/7cca3c578d7d8233e8cde95312c75352.jpg"><br><br>  Waiters in awesome costumes: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/860/10e/2bc/86010e2bc0d9461a98647f1ab97ffb0a.jpg"><br><br>  As I study English in this wonderful city, my mentors demand that I talk as often as possible with anyone I can.  Therefore, I asked the waiter to conduct a small tour - and at the same time I told him about the distant snow-covered Russia, Habr, vodka and a bear. <br><br>  It turns out that it all started with the fact that a year ago the guys bought something like a former factory.  Clean empty room, which could be arranged as you like.  And they had this coffee machine: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/33c/efa/5f5/33cefa5f5a1be59c0ae8163fcd8184ec.jpg"><br><br>  The car came in our time straight from the 1940s, where it was once used to roast coffee slowly and stupidly.  The guys decided to start with her and furnish everything in the spirit of steampunk. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/42a/a60/2aa/42aa602aa13a82c5f9e4690f27268169.jpg"><br><br>  Then, one by one - and here they have already collected a number of interesting things on the shelves: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/e20/3d3/3fa/e203d33fa8198880792e61e9b45894d8.jpg"><br><br>  Here is the famous "Underwood" even have: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/1ce/6d9/21e/1ce6d921e87e387559d4ecd2bd814916.jpg"><br><br>  And piano for evening music.  I'm not sure, but there seems to be some strange mechanism inside: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/333/91c/f62/33391cf62d820d2de478ef63dc368106.jpg"><br><br>  Here is another waiter: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/956/cbd/039/956cbd0394090c66d67e0d37eed3d3d1.jpg"><br><br>  Coffee here is quite unusual.  The fact is that I usually choose tea when it is on the menu.  It was not there, and I asked for coffee with a little cake.  The waiter asked if sugar was needed.  ‚ÄúYes, of course, needed,‚Äù I say.  He brings coffee, brings a whole basket of different types of sugar and says: ‚ÄúFriend, if not difficult, try coffee without sugar.  Just one small sip. ‚Äù  I try - and ofigevu from taste.  He waits thirty seconds and asks with a knowing smile: "Well, do you need sugar?" - "No, thank you."  It turns out that they carry grains of 5 different types from 5 different countries.  They are fried separately, and then mixed in some proportions, established, it seems, according to the methods of the book Cooking for Geeks (by the way, I recommend). <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/b38/e2d/14b/b38e2d14bc6a78c8423448275005f835.jpg"><br><br>  Menu (1 rand is about 3-3.5 rubles): <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/bda/b6b/db4/bdab6bdb47aa586ae973f9424b1b4b3c.jpg"><br><br>  Restaurant outside.  Pay attention to the hefty windows: thanks to them there is a light breeze on one side, and a twilight pleasant to read from the screen - on the other: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/10b/eb0/2e2/10beb02e2609f6ae939c6078ba48c89a.jpg"><br><br>  And this - probably could be a place for rifles: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/5aa/55e/486/5aa55e4864d52e143efceb449a353b22.jpg"><br><br>  By the way, there is a very interesting model of coworking.  The fact is that usually for South Africa in a cafe 50 megabytes of Internet is given for a rather dumb Wi-Fi.  Considering that many people work half a day in this coffee shop, it would be wise to introduce either pay for time, as in the anti-cafe, or raise the price of coffee to wild Starbucks.  So, the way out was found easier: the first hour of the Internet is free, then pay for it.  It is possible to take something like a membership voucher-travel.  In general, it was the mechanics that fascinated me: an ordinary coffee shop for all-all-all with more than reasonable prices and, in fact, a cafe with pay-for-time for those who use it as co-working.  Considering that I had my own club of board games just in accordance with the anti-cafe model, the visit turned out to be more than developing. <br><br>  And a little more entourage: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/5e4/3e7/5b2/5e43e75b229276ea3b255b494d55d345.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/b32/d2a/318/b32d2a31861d351fd2a40a6017404e12.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/993/abd/c97/993abdc97c502ad97670b5ce3d0e515d.jpg"><br><br>  There are two disk phones in the coffee house, both are connected: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/c3c/0ac/16e/c3c0ac16e9d001c950a72ac8cffe18c3.jpg"><br><br>  In general, as a whole, it is surprising to work out all sorts of trifles, starting from the waiters' bags and ending with the still-made utility room.  I immediately wanted something the same with us.  Judging by the collection, it seems to me that the cafe was made not only by the owners, but either the local IT community or the role-playrs had a hand in this. <br>  <sup>Yes, and for everyone - is there anyone in touch from Cape Town?</sup> <br><br>  And - all good Monday! </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/217541/">https://habr.com/ru/post/217541/</a></p>
