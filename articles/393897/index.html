The owner claims that the car made a maneuver without his participation, being parked on the side of the road. <br><br>  According to the owner of the car, on April 29, he parked his car on the street in the town of Lyndon and went about his business.  He left the car just behind the long cargo trailer.  At the same time, he did not immediately move away from his car, but was nearby for about a minute, answering questions from an employee of a business business who was interested in a car, located nearby. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Then Overton went about his business, and when he returned five minutes later, in the company of the same employee, he found his car colliding with a trailer.  The owner filed a complaint with the Tesla company, and a week later received a reply, from which it followed that he himself was to blame for the incident.

      The report, in fact, stated that based on the results of studying the logs, the company concluded that the driver activated the function of calling the car, during which the car automatically without the driver‚Äôs participation drives up to it, or, on the contrary, parks.  True, the driver must check that the car‚Äôs surroundings are safe enough for such a maneuver. <br><br>  Tesla representatives say that the automatic parking function is still in test mode, and it is the driver‚Äôs responsibility to ensure the safety of the vehicle‚Äôs maneuvers. <br><br>  Overton does not agree with this decision of the company - he did not call the car, but judging by the analysis of the logs, the car started moving three seconds after the driver got out of the car and closed the door.  The owner was next to the car for at least 20 seconds while talking to an employee, and they probably would have noticed if the car suddenly drove and crashed into a trailer. <br><br>  The owner of the car is no longer worried about the money issue (although the replacement of the glass cost him $ 700), but why the car suddenly switched to the parking mode.  ‚ÄúImagine if he bumped into a child,‚Äù Overton said in an interview.  ‚ÄúI guarantee that Tesla would have reacted differently to this incident.‚Äù </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/393897/">https://habr.com/ru/post/393897/</a></p>
