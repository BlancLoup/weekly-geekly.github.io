It was the first localization experience of the then very young service (Evernote - the way you know it today, appeared on June 24, 2008).  We responsibly approached the debut in the international arena by translating the web client and all existing Evernote applications at that time.  We also took care of the support of the Russian language with our handwriting and typing recognition technology. <br><br>  Today, Evernote is used by more than 1.5 million people in Russia and the CIS countries, and this figure continues to grow.  We are very grateful to everyone who made our service a part of their life. <br><br>  Today we would like to tell about the main points of our four-year history.  We hope that our old users will be interested to remember, and new - to learn how Evernote has been developing all this time. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  <strong>April 2, 2009.</strong>  <strong>Evernote spoke in Russian</strong>

Evernote is a company with Russian roots, its founder and many employees know Russian, therefore the decision on the first country for localization was made unanimously. <br><br>  It is worth discovering a small secret: we were fully ready for the launch on April 1, but decided not to risk it and wait another day - we could not joke with the first international launch. <br><br>  <strong>June 25, 2009.</strong>  <strong>Joint notepads appear in Evernote</strong> <br><br>  The ability to open your notebooks to other users and the world has become a key event for the Evernote service.  Our functions of collaboration and knowledge sharing have constantly evolved, for example, today we have a full-fledged knowledge management product for small and medium businesses - <a href="http://evernote.com/intl/ru/business/">Evernote Business</a> . <br><br>  The new opportunity has gained popularity from users who have begun to share a variety of information with others.  Today on the Internet you can find many open notebooks.  For example, <a href="https://www.evernote.com/pub/riadda/recipes">vegetarian recipes</a> , <a href="https://www.evernote.com/pub/mixazen/zen">management</a> <a href="https://www.evernote.com/pub/vabue/Admin">materials, sysadmin materials</a> , <a href="https://www.evernote.com/pub/tamsol80/travel">travel tips</a> , <a href="https://www.evernote.com/pub/briztaker/productivity_porn">productivity</a> <a href="https://www.evernote.com/pub/macbang/tips">tips</a> , <a href="https://www.evernote.com/pub/pruffi_friends/pruffifriends">job openings,</a> and <a href="https://www.evernote.com/pub/macbang/tips">tips for Mac users</a> . <br><br>  <strong>July 29, 2009.</strong>  <strong>The advent of the Evernote translation community</strong> <br><br>  We would not be able to make Evernote so quickly accessible to users in their native languages ‚Äã‚Äãif not for the help of volunteers.  Evernote fans enthusiastically set about translating the service into many languages, and volunteers from Russia made a lot of effort. <br><br>  <strong>December 16, 2009.</strong>  <strong>Evernote for Android</strong> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/6de/9b8/688/6de9b8688347e69832a7f4d05e10ff03.png"><br><br>  Hardly appeared, <a href="https://market.android.com/details%3Fid%3Dcom.evernote">Evernote for Android has</a> become one of the most popular applications of our service and today is among the favorites of Google Play editors. <br><br>  Now the Android application is the most frequently used Evernote client in Russia.  It accounts for a third of all calls to the service.  The second place is shared by the web client and the Windows application (14% each), and the top three are Evernote for iPad (10%). <br><br>  <strong>July 14, 2010.</strong>  <strong>Evernote Gallery Appearance</strong> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/536/f3b/b14/536f3bb14afabec854a6c2cca69a42fc.png" alt="apps" width="622" height="207"><br><br>  Shortly after the launch of Evernote, we presented to the developer community an open and free API that allowed everyone to add Evernote functionality to their applications, services and devices.  The number of solutions on the Evernote platform has grown rapidly, and we decided to create a place to showcase the best partner products, presenting <a href="http://trunk.evernote.com/ru/">the Evernote Gallery</a> . <br><br>  We are very pleased that today there are Russian applications, such as <a href="http://trunk.evernote.com/ru/app/text-grabber/iphone">ABBYY Text Grabber + Translator</a> and <a href="http://trunk.evernote.com/ru/app/exlibris/ipad">Exlibris FB2</a> . <br><br>  <strong>November 11, 2010.</strong>  <strong>Quarterly premium subscription for Russian users</strong> <br><br>  In addition to the standard options for acquiring a premium subscription for 1 month and 1 year, especially for Russian Evernote users, we have provided an additional possibility of payment for a period of 3 months.  This option is still <a href="http://www.softkey.ru/catalog/basket.php%3Fprodid%3D452449%26amp%3Bquantity%3D%26amp%3Bfrom%3D1806674%26amp%3Breferer1%3Dblog%26amp%3Breferer2%3Dannounce3m">available</a> at the store of our partner Softkey. <br><br>  <strong>February 18, 2011.</strong>  <strong>Creating a Russian-speaking Evernote Support Community</strong> <br><br>  The official forum for Evernote users to talk and discuss emerging issues has long been an English-language forum.  For Russian-speaking users, we launched a separate platform where they could talk about their difficulties, help others and ask questions to our employees. <br><br>  Today, over 6 thousand users are registered in <a href="http://ru-support.evernote.com/">the support community</a> , who created about 3,500 discussions and left more than 11 thousand comments. <br><br>  <strong>April 27, 2011.</strong>  <strong>Meeting with developers in Moscow</strong> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/b1f/301/508/b1f3015089612fcc11eb8a576fa8cf25.jpg"><br><br>  There are many talented developers in Russia, and we really want them to expand the capabilities of their products by integrating with the Evernote platform. <br><br>  In April 2011, we gathered developers in Moscow (Digital October Center) and <a href="http://blog.evernote.com/ru/2012/05/02/dev-meetup-results/">talked</a> about promoting partner solutions, the capabilities of our API, and the annual <a href="http://devcup.evernote.com/">Evernote Devcup</a> Developer <a href="http://devcup.evernote.com/">Championship</a> . <br><br>  <strong>June 16, 2011.</strong>  <strong>Evernote output for Windows Phone 7</strong> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/21a/59a/549/21a59a549891f4943fd906fbabb9d596.png"><br><br>  At Evernote, we have always strived to create full-fledged clients for various platforms, and by 2011 we had 13 versions of Evernote on our account.  The fourteenth was the application <a href="http://www.windowsphone.com/ru-RU/apps/db21927d-f292-e011-986b-78e7d1fa76f8">Evernote for Windows Phone</a> !  By the way, we recently updated it to version 3.0, significantly reworking the interface and adding a number of useful features. <br><br>  <strong>August 18, 2011.</strong>  <strong>Evernote acquires Skitch, makes it free and releases the Android version</strong> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/680/9cb/3bb/6809cb3bb943be8e16a1c77d9bb8ec40.jpg"><br><br>  In 2011, we announced a new stage of development of the company - the emergence of a whole family of Evernote applications.  Our first step in this direction was the acquisition of <a href="http://evernote.com/intl/ru/skitch/">Skitch</a> , a convenient tool for adding marks and comments on images.  At that time, it was a paid Mac app.  Now Skitch is free, integrated with Evernote and has versions for Android, Windows, iOS and Windows 8 Touch. <br><br>  <strong>November 16, 2011.</strong>  <strong>Evernote Clearly exit</strong> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/19c/425/c5b/19c425c5b9ea1ba2264a15d4cb453a7e.png"><br><br>  Continuing to develop the Evernote family of applications, we introduced a new browser extension (Chrome first, and then Firefox) - <a href="http://evernote.com/intl/ru/clearly/">Evernote Clearly</a> , which allows you to clear the text of an online article from distracting web elements and make it more readable.  In addition, users can customize the presentation of the text, as well as highlight key points in the article and save it to Evernote. <br><br>  <strong>December 7, 2011.</strong>  <strong>Evernote Hello and Evernote Food</strong> <br><br><img src="http://evernote.com/media/img/products/hero_hello.png"><br><br>  Working on the convenience of adding certain types of information to Evernote, we paid particular attention to two of the most requested categories of entries: culinary impressions and contact details.  Special applications have been developed for them: <a href="http://evernote.com/intl/ru/food/">Evernote Food</a> and <a href="http://evernote.com/intl/ru/hello/">Evernote Hello</a> . <br><br><img src="http://evernote.com/media/img/products/hero_food.png"><br><br>  Food serves as a convenient place to save and view recipes and impressions from memorable meals, as well as search for restaurants.  Hello is a great solution for saving data about all the people you meet. <br><br>  <strong>May 3, 2012. The first e-book about Evernote in Russian</strong> <br><br><br><br>  There are many books written about Evernote, both electronic and paper, but most of them are in English and Japanese.  The first book dedicated to increasing productivity with the help of Evernote in Russian, was the work of Gani Sultanov <a href="http://blog.evernote.com/ru/2012/05/03/self-organization-with-evernote/">"How to feed an elephant</a> . <a href="http://blog.evernote.com/ru/2012/05/03/self-organization-with-evernote/">"</a> <br><br>  <strong>May 7, 2012. Evernote acquires Penultimate</strong> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/e99/fed/63a/e99fed63acdcfaa48ed0e3abaca14abf.png"><br><br>  The latest addition to the Evernote family of applications has become <a href="http://evernote.com/intl/ru/penultimate/">Penultimate</a> , a popular handwriting application on the iPad.  We integrated it with Evernote, making it possible to search for handwritten records and synchronize them.  Recently Penultimate also became free. <br><br>  <strong>August 24, 2012. Evernote and Moleskine create a joint notebook.</strong> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/abc/428/44c/abc42844c03392e5423052531f98272e.png"><br><br>  Moleskine notebooks have long become iconic among creative people due to their quality and design.  These notebooks had only one drawback - they remained on paper, but <a href="http://blog.evernote.com/ru/2012/08/24/evernote-smart-notebook-moleskine/">Evernote Smart Notebook</a> fixed this.  Notebook pages have special markup that simplifies handwriting recognition with Evernote, and allows you to securely store digital copies of your texts.  Working with notebooks is supported in mobile applications for iOS and Android. <br><br>  Because of the excessive demand for notebooks, they traveled to Russia for quite a long time, but in January they still appeared on the Russian market.  More recently, the Indinotes.com store offered <a href="http://blog.evernote.com/ru/2013/03/26/evernote-5-for-android/">a 10% discount</a> for Evernote users, which can still be taken advantage of. <br><br>  <strong>September 13, 2012. Evernote Experts</strong> <br><br>  We launched the <a href="http://evernote.com/intl/ru/community/">Evernote Experts</a> program in Russia, which allowed us to identify active and experienced users of the service and create conditions in which they could share their accumulated knowledge. <br><br>  We are grateful to <a href="http://blog.evernote.com/ru/2012/02/22/blondytravel/">Angelica Medvedeva</a> (travel), <a href="http://blog.evernote.com/ru/2012/09/14/armen-petrosyan/">Armen Petrosyan</a> (productivity), <a href="http://blog.evernote.com/ru/2012/09/17/expert-darya-gubert/">Darya Hubert</a> (healthy food), <a href="http://blog.evernote.com/ru/2012/10/03/expert-marina-eliseeva/">Marina Eliseeva</a> (time management) and <a href="http://blog.evernote.com/ru/2012/12/04/expert-evgeniy-vyskub/">Evgeny Vyskubu</a> (business) for taking the time and opportunity to share their experience with others.  In the near future we plan to replenish our expert program with new interesting participants. <br><br>  You can also ask your question to the Evernote Expert or discuss one or another aspect of using the service in the relevant field in <a href="http://vk.com/evernote_ru">our ‚ÄúIn Contact‚Äù group</a> . <br><br>  <strong>October 26, 2012. Evernote Exit for Windows 8 Touch</strong> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/53d/148/655/53d14865526916f6240d0dc3133b385f.png"><br><br>  <a href="http://apps.microsoft.com/webpdp/app/evernote/5aba7f8c-318f-42aa-9590-b1fc31e5cba6">Evernote for Windows 8 Touch</a> became available in the Windows Store from the first day of the app store and offers users an organic interface for this platform in combination with the basic features of Evernote. <br><br>  <strong>December 4, 2012 Million users in Russia</strong> <br>  In December, the number of Evernote users from Russia crossed the million mark and continues to grow.  This is a very significant milestone for us, because we have always viewed Russia as one of the key countries, to which, moreover, we have historically developed a special relationship. <br><br>  <strong>February 28, 2013. Launch of Evernote Business in Russia</strong> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/d65/a60/d72/d65a60d72e40296beef3267eccd2a33b.png"><br><br>  Since 66% of our users use Evernote for business purposes, we took care of creating a comfortable environment for storing and sharing information within small companies and teams and presented <a href="http://evernote.com/intl/ru/business/">Evernote Business</a> . <br><br>  The new product has incorporated all the functionality of the basic service and premium subscriptions Evernote, as well as offered a number of new features created specifically for small and medium businesses.  Since the launch of Evernote Business, more than 3,000 companies and teams around the world have armed themselves to increase the productivity of their employees and effectively disseminate important information within the company. <br><br>  ‚ÄúWe have come a long way together, and yet we are still at the very beginning.‚Äù  Our team continues to work to ensure that you can use external digital memory even more conveniently and efficiently on all devices and in all areas of life. <br><br>  We want to thank once again all our users for choosing Evernote, for helping us to make the service better and recommend it to your friends and colleagues.  We hope that the future history of Evernote, we will do together! </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/175073/">https://habr.com/ru/post/175073/</a></p>
