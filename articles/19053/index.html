  <section class="page js-page"><h1>New technologies of the Middle Ages</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  <em>Phillip the Beautiful reluctantly entrusted the Templars to the cardinals indicated by Clement V ... And the leaders of the Order, as soon as they appeared before the envoys of the pope, immediately refused their testimony.</em> <em><br></em>  <em>Jacques de Molay even dared again to write to the brethren in writing, urging them to take heart.</em>  <em>Dad, convinced of the falsity of the confessions, which he was helpfully informed about, and of Phillip the Beautiful's cunning, revoked the inquisitors' powers and decided to reconsider the case himself and from the very beginning.</em> <em><br><a name="habracut"></a><br></em>  <em>To the extreme, he needed to act quickly, for all this time the Templars were kept in the dungeons of Phillip and his agents, being subjected to treatment that could prove fatal to them.</em>  <em>Clement V hesitated too much, recruiting commission members he decided to establish.</em>  <em>As was to be feared, the king was ahead of him.</em>  <em>Hiding his anger, he did not express any protest against the termination of the activities of the judges who were committed to him.</em>  <em>But true to his character, he found a different path to the goal, albeit a cunning, intricate, but completely original.</em>  <em><strong>Since the pope challenged the legality of the confessions that had been torn from the Templars, and seemed to decide to allow them to justify themselves, in other words, to save the Order, it was necessary for the whole country to support the king, who demanded their punishment.</strong></em>  <em><strong>He decided to consult with legal experts - and not because his opinion was really important to him, but to flatter their vanity and win over to their side.</strong></em>  <em><strong>One of these lawyers discreetly suggested that only the first confessions should be considered true, and all subsequent refutations are null and void.</strong></em>  <em>Doctors of the university made additional clarifications: in their opinion, the trial of the Templars extended to the pope, so it was unwise for him to interfere in it so actively.</em>  <em>As for the property of prisoners, good doctors, not losing sight of the interests of the Church, decided that it should be used to protect the Holy Land, which, in fact, was the original purpose of the Templars.</em> <em><br><br></em>  <em>Such subtleties entertained Phillip the Beautiful, who laughed at the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãa new conquest of the Holy Places, but saw in the confiscation of the property of the Order a means to replenish the state treasury.</em>  <em><strong>And he ordered one of his henchmen, Pierre Dubois, to write a false ‚Äúwarning of the French people.‚Äù</strong></em>  <em><strong>What did Dubois write on behalf of the people?</strong></em>  <em><strong>He incited the most Christian King to immediately punish the Templars with the permission of the Pope, his accomplice.</strong></em>  <em>He referred to the precedent of Moses, who ordered to kill twenty-two thousand admirers of the golden calf, regardless of the opinion of his brother Aaron, who was the supreme high priest.</em>  <em>The latter, being in the above-mentioned dignity, could not order the slaughter, but Moses could, because he was a layman.</em>  <em>Is it not the duty of the most Christian king to fight the antichrist?</em> <em><br></em>  <em><strong>‚ÄúHave not all these Templars been murderers or supporters, supporters, accomplices and concealers of murderers who have criminalized apostates and murderers?‚Äù</strong></em> <em><br><br></em>  <em>Called thus by the French people to "fulfill their duty", Phillip the Beautiful could not delay any longer.</em>
