  <section class="page js-page"><h1>How to translate the game into 20 languages ‚Äã‚Äãand not go to hell</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Hi, I am Vladimir Kupratsevich, manager of translation projects at <a href="https://alconost.com/%3Futm_source%3Dhabrahabr%26utm_medium%3Darticle%26utm_campaign%3Down_article%26utm_content%3Dlocalize-no-hell">Alconost</a> .  Once a client approached us - a developer of games for Android and iOS.  He wanted to localize his game into 20 languages, including Arabic, Japanese, and Korean.  Why not, we thought: we can and can localize applications, we have translators-native speakers.  But the devil is in the details.  Looking ahead, I will say that we carried out the rite of exorcism successfully, at the same time <s>stuffing nehily</s> experiments with useful experience.  We decided to make transfers on a cloud platform - and we were not mistaken.  I will tell you what devils we drove out thanks to this decision.  I think that every developer and translator in the field of IT will benefit from this experience. <br><br> <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/company/alconost/blog/214567/"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/e82/e1d/5ca/e82e1d5cae1794421cbff60c5852a242.jpg"></a> <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h4>  First devil </h4><br>  The game is updated regularly.  Relatively speaking, every day you need to translate three lines into 20 languages.  It means that it is impossible to translate "on a turn-key basis" and, with a pure soul, remove all project documentation to the chest.  Indeed, in the new lines may be mentioned entities and concepts that already exist in the game.  They must be translated in a uniform manner so that the conditional ‚ÄúDunno‚Äù, once embodied under the name Neznayka, is not incarnated either in the incarnation of the Silly, then in the image of the Ignorant. <br><br>  <b>The expulsion of the first devil</b> .  Firstly, a database of specific terminology is created.  With this glossary, we immediately introduce a new translator, starting to work (if someone from the ‚Äútop twenty‚Äù switched to another project or dropped out for other reasons).  Secondly, the pro-freezer, an editor who reads the translated text, is sure to get acquainted with this base.

      <b>Profit for the client</b> .  As a result, the client receives high-quality translations in all the necessary languages.  We pull the client less, without asking the same questions from different artists: familiarizing the translator with the glossary immediately removes some of the questions.  And ‚Äúquality control‚Äù performed by editors is the best protection against not entirely suitable options, inaccuracies and typographical errors. <br><br><h4>  Second devil </h4><br>  In the versions of the application for iOS and Android regularly meet the same phrases.  It is expensive and unreasonable to translate each phrase separately.  Manually looking for an analogue in localization for another platform is inconvenient and time consuming. <br><br>  <b>The exile of the second devil</b> .  In the cloud platform used by us there is an option "translation memory".  If any phrases or remarks within the project were transferred earlier (even under a different platform), the system will automatically substitute an already existing version of the translation.  Like all the other replicas, the phrase added from the ‚Äúmemory‚Äù must be subtracted by the editor, and if the autochange is not suitable for some reason, the translator will pay attention to it. <br><br>  <b>Profit for the client</b> .  Localizations are usually paid for by the number of characters.  The presence of memory in the cloud system reduces the amount of text for live translation.  So, localization will cost the client cheaper. <br><br>  Even if localization is done only for one platform, the translation memory is still useful for automatic replacement of standard phrases.  For example, if we begin the first quest with the phrase: ‚ÄúGreat things are waiting for you, oh young Padawan!‚Äù, Then the second quest should be started in the same way so as not to confuse the user.  The translation memory not only optimizes the client‚Äôs costs, but also makes it possible to unify the texts in order to make it easier for the user to navigate the game processes. <br><br><h4>  Third devil </h4><br>  20 translators and 20 editors work on the translation into 20 languages.  That is, 40 people, not counting the manager.  These talented people live in different time zones.  But this factor cannot influence the release date.  Ideally, as soon as developers add new replicas to text files, they should immediately get to each of the 20 translators so that they can begin to localize as soon as possible.  Similar expectations - and from the developers: ideally, the translated lines should immediately fall into the project after reading by the editor.  Immediately - this is not tomorrow, but this very minute. <br><br>  If at any of the stages, be it an ‚Äúincoming‚Äù receipt of lines for translation or an ‚Äúoutgoing‚Äù sending of localized texts, there are delays, we get straight to the boiling resin boiler. <br><br>  <b>The expulsion of the third devil</b> .  We have automated the delivery of texts from the client and sending them finished lines using the cloud platform File API.  It means that 20 letters with the problem statement to the translators - to the firebox, the same number of letters to the editors - to the same place.  The task is set automatically, the ready translation is immediately sent to the editor, localized texts are instantly uploaded to the project.  Of course, there is a risk that the translator or editor can ignore the task received, but our guys were not found to be so, and God bless them.  One way or another, the manager is always on guard - he monitors the progress of work so that translations into all languages ‚Äã‚Äãare performed at the same rapid pace. <br><br>  <b>Profit for the client</b> .  The client saves time, and the risk of delayed release due to unavailability of localized versions is minimized. <br><br><h4>  Fourth devil </h4><br>  What to do with the replica, if the context of its use is unclear?  A funny phrase to translate literally or localize creatively - for example, a meme?  The client sent three replicas in capital letters and three in lower case;  take this into account when localizing?  These and 100 other questions are hell for the manager, because each translator receives their own set of comments.  To ask all questions to the client by mail means to overwhelm him with dozens of letters and stop work.  Do not ask questions - you can not. <br><br>  <b>The exile of the fourth devil</b> .  The cloud platform we use allows us to discuss about each replica.  The translator and the client discuss controversial issues without an intermediary in the person of the manager, which has a beneficial effect on the pace of work.  The manager does not drown in disparate questions, does not confuse the questions of the ‚ÄúJapanese‚Äù translator with the comments of the localizer ‚ÄúFrenchman‚Äù - this is not happiness. <br><br>  <b>Profit for the client</b> .  The entire workflow is transparent to the client.  Directly contacting translators on controversial issues, the client can quickly influence the result and immediately choose the options that he likes more.  In fact, this reduces the number of iterations, because all edits are made in the course of work. <br><br>  Read about these and other devils in my <a href="https://docs.google.com/a/alconost.com/presentation/d/1bnUe0YC6AFS-LhkOPGlLsMQ4JM6fyGkXh2dStQIghBo/edit">presentation</a> or look in my talk at DevGAMM Kyiv 2013: <br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Video blitz report</b> <div class="spoiler_text"><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Gje2bm9GWcQ" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></div></div><br>  I would be glad if our experience helps you to do the localization without pain.
