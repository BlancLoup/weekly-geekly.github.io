They are becoming more and more.  Do not understand where these commands come from?  And where do they find developers?  The only answer is a trend and everyone wants to get into fashion and money. <br>  A little thought, I decided to collect tips for those who are starting to develop mobile applications, I believe that it will be useful)) <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  <b>To start developing an application you need:</b> <br>  ‚Ä¢ Analyze mobile platforms (it is necessary to understand the features) <br>  ‚Ä¢ Analyze mobile devices (features) <br>  ‚Ä¢ Recruit a development team <br>  ‚Ä¢ Make a possible budget <br>  ‚Ä¢ Build a marketing strategy <br><br>  <b>In order to properly get in the course, you need to answer the following questions:</b> <br>  ‚Ä¢ <b>Which business sectors need to enter the mobile market?</b>

The most popular platforms are iPhone and Android, they have a lot in common, but a thoughtful application will include features that use the features of each of them. <br>  2. <b>Engagement.</b>  The app should be fascinating.  The most popular applications are games.  But those that are not games also have an element of entertainment.  The application can use a huge amount of functionality that is even hard to imagine, but the best way to get a person to use it is to introduce an element of entertainment. <br>  3. <b>Benefit.</b>  The application should bring significant user benefits.  Then he will use it for a long time. <br><br>  ‚Ä¢ <b>What are the features of monetization in the Russian market?</b> <br><br>  It is clear that in Russia the situation is different than in the American or European markets.  Active positions have already been taken by several companies that specialize in application development, they understand what the market needs and how to do it. <br>  It is believed that about 90 percent of developers can not succeed and return the money that was invested in their projects. <br>  In fact, Russia is the most profitable market for mobile software manufacturers.  Only 7% of mobile subscribers use smartphones in our country.  For comparison: in Western Europe - 28%.  The Russian smartphone market in the coming years, according to forecasts, expects a titanic growth.  So start developing applications now. <br><br>  <b>Summing up:</b> <br>  Probably, the above are the main aspects that you should think about before starting the development of mobile applications.  When the first application is developed by you, experience will appear, you will receive feedback from users, you will consider it and the next application will be much better.  There are many posts on the Internet, when developers talk about their experiences, they will also be useful to read. <br>  It is also useful to listen to the people who are engaged in this, just on the topic of creating mobile applications will be an interesting event on June 2 in the Ingria Business Incubator (St. Petersburg).  Several speakers are invited, both from the agency and the customer.
