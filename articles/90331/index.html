Let's pay tribute to today's "shocking" online journalism, laugh at the banter and proceed directly to the issue of disclosure. <br><br>  On February 1, a little more than two months ago, I started Twitter in order to get to know the essence of this ‚Äúbreakthrough in 2009‚Äù, according to the organizers of the Webby Award (analogous to the film Oscar), as well as the ‚Äúwords of 2009‚Äù according to Global Language Monitor.  The word is Twitter. <br><br>  I viewed my own <a href="http://twitter.com/">Twitter account</a> as a kind of social experiment.  The fact of the matter is that at first, a rather intent look, Twitter seemed to be a dummy. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h3>  Why dummy? </h3><br>  The meaning of Twitter on the move is difficult to understand.  Open any account and see about the following stream of muddy consciousness:

      <i>@ n9mg7us I promise to give the colocation server?</i>  <i>Or how to interpret it?</i> <i><br></i>  <i>* * *</i> <i><br></i>  <i>Even if we take a USB cable out of the box with the printer ... Well, I don‚Äôt know who has a smarter supplier.</i> <i><br></i>  <i>* * *</i> <i><br></i>  <i>@fouuyrov xD</i> <i><br></i>  <i>* * *</i> <i><br></i>  <i>All right, spring is already dominating!</i>  <i>Sun =)</i> <i><br></i>  <i>* * *</i> <i><br></i>  <i>@dikutss hde?</i>  <i>let me have a look</i> <i><br></i>  <i>* * *</i> <i><br></i>  <i>Cuba - far away!</i>  <i>Cuba is near!</i> <br><br>  A person who is used to doing business has a dumb question: ‚ÄúWTF ?!‚Äù <br><br>  Meanwhile, today 50 million such phrases (tweets) pass through the Twitter server every day.  The service is in a phase of rapid increase in popularity: <br><br><img src="http://cdn.cloudfiles.mosso.com/c54092/x2_10beb74" alt="Twitter statistics"><br><br>  These are serious numbers.  But what is their secret? <br><br>  And the secret is that <b>now all the flooders and spam bots of the world are going on Twitter.</b> <br><br>  Never before in the modern history of mankind did spam bots feel so at ease.  We take any dictionary, take out of it 4-5 words in a row - tweet is ready!  What kind of training, what artificial intelligence?  Twitter eats everything! <br><br>  This is an ideal place for those who are used to ‚Äúchatting‚Äù on forums, in zhezheshkah, classmates, ICQ and in all sorts of comments in the style: <br>  - Hayushki all! <br>  - And those vacations! <br>  - What is it? <br>  - Norm D <br>  - Me too )))) <br>  (Total: 5 posts already generated) <br><br>  These are the very people who seriously argue that no forums, no chats and no ICQ will replace live, human communication by SMS.  Twitter is available via mobile phones!  And this is exactly what is vital to such a service. <br><br>  But Twitter is a dummy complex.  Deepen the same. <br><br><h3>  What you need to know about Twitter? </h3><br>  Formulas for active people who, like me earlier, do not see any sense in using Twitter for a long time.  Thoughtful smoking of formulas contributes at least to a partial understanding of the phenomenon. <br><br>  - Twitter is not read.  They write in it. <br><br>  - Even Twitter friends do not read.  They are being <b>tracked</b> . <br><br>  - Twitter is not designed for the reader.  It is designed for <s>fast,</s> ultra-fast contact. <br><br>  - To use Twitter, you need a client, for example <a href="http://www.tweetdeck.com/">TweetDeck</a> <br><br>  - Communication through the Twitter web-interface at the moment does not make sense no less than in general. <br><br>  - Twitter is something like ICQ and Skype built-in chat, just speak for everyone.  How to talk about the case?  Your problems. <br><br>  - This is a social network.  Anonymus is not interesting to anyone here. <br><br>  - Twitter is not created for correspondence and discussions. <br><br>  - Twitter is a new information and communication environment, the laws of which are born before our eyes. <br><br>  - Twitter is a super fast friend reaction.  You say ‚ÄúUp!‚Äù And after a couple of seconds, ‚ÄúUp-up, up-up, up-up.‚Äù  Like cool!  After 5 minutes, the joke is no longer relevant and has no value. <br><br>  - For the reader, no one here writes.  It's hard, but you need to understand.  It is traditionally considered that the smarter, more distinct, more intelligible, more consistent and competent the content, the more audience it is able to gather.  For Twitter, this is not the case.  There is no place to show all these qualities, and the audience does not have the time / tool to recognize these qualities. <br><br>  - Twitter is an artificial generation that took three years to enter orbit (the service was launched in 2006, popularity came in 2009).  The artificiality lies in the restriction of messages to 140 characters, which is not explained by anything but an idea, but it is a kind of legalization of flood.  Literate idea, but did not come right away. <br><br>  - Twitter archive is not important.  It makes no sense.  It is useless to reread it, like the logs of any cot chat. <br><br>  - Twitter is a public chat, where there is more than one given tape / topic of conversation, but each speaker is such a tape and each person collects his own tape for himself. <br><br>  - Twitter is similar to RSS feed, or LJ of friends, where the headers alone, because the texts under the headings no longer interest anyone. <br><br>  - Twitter completely ignores quotes to help understand what is at stake.  They are not needed, because if you did not answer right away for a maximum of half an hour, then your answer is no longer relevant. <br><br>  The most difficult is to find a useful place, a useful function that Twitter could perform in the daily flow of affairs.  A person actively working on the Internet has all the functions <b>already</b> distributed: <br>  - For professional communication - forums and thematic sites <br>  - For working contact - ICQ and Skype <br>  - For the discharging fan - habraeffekt <br>  etc. <br><br>  Where to shove Twitter? .. <br><br>  No less difficult is getting rid of the theft of someone else's time.  Post bullshit?  Yes!  You have to learn if you want to join the ranks of hardened twitter stitches.  The real fruits of mental work, technical details, secrets of skill and professional chips are not needed here.  First, in 140 characters it is difficult to squeeze even simple thoughts, not to mention explanations.  Even the stern wit, the one-man Vishnevsky will hardly have success here.  And secondly, well, what thoughts, my dear?  Twitter accounts diverge on mobile phones and all kinds of gadgets - on the road, in traffic jams, on escalators and footboards of trams, your readers.  And in half an hour it is not interesting to anyone. <br><br><h3>  Suddenly </h3><br>  But the funny thing is that all the features of Twitter and all the listed dummies - this is the most that neither is the <b>trend</b> .  Everything is moving in this direction.  Super fast contact on "you".  At best, they solved a minor issue.  But usually - they just <b>contacted</b> , they whipped out an empty spark and ran away. <br><br>  <i>- Tell me some X!</i> <i><br></i>  <i>- Look in Google</i> <i><br></i>  <i>- Thx!</i> <br><br><h3>  Be in touch </h3><br>  You know the vigorous, young Muscovites, who at the beginning of the meeting always briskly shoot ‚ÄúHi-hi!‚Äù, And at the end the self-generated ‚ÄúBye-bye!‚Äù Appears by itself?  And then the sacramental ‚ÄúAha, in touch ...‚Äù is surely added!  It's them!  Twitter made for them.  For people of this type.  And he is needed precisely in order to be in touch.  Always be in touch.  It is fashionable.  This is a trend.  Being in touch is more important than the quality of communication. <br><br><img src="http://cdn.cloudfiles.mosso.com/c54092/x2_10bf1d6" alt="Be in touch"><br>  <i>Be in touch: fashion rings are made just for this</i> <br><br><h3>  Harsh truth </h3><br>  Now, <a href="http://blogs.yandex.ru/top/twitter">according to Yandex,</a> there are about 170 thousand Russian-speaking Twi-blogs.  Twitter has a big problem with active and stillborn accounts.  So, ‚Äúwith a total global number of accounts of more than 75 million in December 2009, according to RJMetrics, no more than 15 million were active users,‚Äù that is, only 20% is quite similar to the norm.  Nikita Kabardin, one of the pioneers of twi-spam technology, called the audience ru-twitterarian close to 25-30 thousand and immediately rightly compared it with the daily audience of a small porn site.  This is what we are dealing with. <br><br>  Massfoloving - the scourge of service, the Main Song of the Soother.  The meaning of the idea is to write each other as friends, thus increasing their audience and of course not implying that they are reading each other‚Äôs messages.  Stupidly post, stupidly increase the rating, <b>stupidly climb up the microsocial ladder</b> .  The leaders of the massfoloving each have 50 thousand "friends".  Read / track at the same time, even with the greatest desire, you can only a couple of dozen foreign tweets. <br><br><h3>  Fetish and quite a Noir 2.0 </h3><br>  Looking at Twitter, Twitter comes up immediately with fun for literary and art-minded people - just for freaks.  The point of the fun is to post tweets exactly 140 characters long - no more, no less.  If you act flawlessly and really post only exactly 140 characters each, then this forces you to work on phrases ‚Äî to search, select, hone.  It looks fake, but tomorrow they will call art. <br><br><h3>  curious </h3><br>  If you write a twi-message in a person's person, a person reads, and then you delete this message from yourself, then it will also be removed from the person.  It‚Äôs like a symbolic hint that you don‚Äôt have to answer for your words.  Erased and done. <br><br>  Twitter can be broadcast via RSS.  It makes no sense to read it, and even more so through RSS. <br><br><h3>  Current and Expected Twitter Issues </h3><br>  <b>Bots</b> <br>  Already, people are creating grids from hundreds of bot accounts, posting thousands of messages per day on their behalf, add each other and all new users to friends, practice mass-feeding, gain some relative weight, similar to Google's PR and TCI of Janex, and then accumulated The ‚Äúresource‚Äù is converted into WebMoney and PayPal tsiferki looking at their own, promoting paid other people's accounts, or carrying out paid advertising campaigns. <br><br>  <b>Spam</b> <br>  Robots index Twitter.  Gather a database of contacts.  Analyze their tweets.  And if you, <a href="http://geektimes.ru/users/username/" class="user_link">UserName,</a> write a couple of times that you choose a new mobile phone from a number of such models, then a careful spam bot, not waiting for a long time, writes a post in the style ‚ÄúI would like <a href="http://geektimes.ru/users/username/" class="user_link">UserName</a> X, but in my experience Y is better‚Äù .  Since messages with the name <a href="http://geektimes.ru/users/username/" class="user_link">UserName are</a> almost always tracked automatically, the post goes right into both of your eyes.  And not that spam looks like ... But spam!  Smart, targeted spam.  There is not a clever, but the most common spam, which six months ago was up to 10% of the number of all tweets.  As it should be, the <a href="http://www.rutwitter.com/twitter-uspeshno-boretsya-so-spamom/">war against spam</a> is fought day and night. <br><br>  <b>Noise</b> <br>  Twitter is choking in the noise of information.  There is so much of it and it is not so structured that Twitter users gradually implement on themselves, right on the run, the law of self-organization of complex systems.  Verbal abbreviations, tags and special rules for sharing tweets are invented.  Of course, the majority of users will never be able to master even the simplest rules introducing at least some structure into this chaos.  But the really funny and extremely curious thing is that all these ‚Äúartificial laws of twi-communication‚Äù painfully resemble something very, very old ... Bah!  Yes, this is moss-grown <a href="http://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/FIDO">Fidonet</a> - ekhi, aliases, carbon, netmail, etc.  Similarly. <br><br>  <b>Manipulations, stuffing and disinformation</b> <br>  Twitter quickly spreads the news.  On the clock faster online media.  But rumors are also spreading quickly.  The problem is that messages on one topic can be tied only by spontaneously created hashtags (keywords).  For example, the recent explosions in the Moscow metro quickly spawned the hashtag <a href="http://search.twitter.com/search%3Fq%3D%26ands%3D%26phrase%3D%26ors%3D%26nots%3D%26tag%3Dmetro29%26lang%3Dru%26from%3D%26to%3D%26ref%3D%26near%3D%26within%3D1000%26units%3Dmi%26since%3D%26until%3D%26rpp%3D20"># metro29</a> <br><br>  By tracking it, it was possible to receive dozens of posts per topic during the first hours every minute.  But in this case, you yourself became the filter of garbage and disinfection.  And it is cooler than ten thousand attendants at the bazaar discussing simultaneously getting a citizen O. Bender under a horse.  Incomparably cooler. <br><br>  In the future, it will be possible to provide some filters for displaying tweets only from users of a certain ‚Äúseriousness status‚Äù, something similar to habrakarma.  But, alas, this will not protect against informational stuffing.  The credibility of the sources is an open and serious Twitter issue. <br><br>  <b>Viruses</b> <br>  Thousands of accounts are created: Flax, Kat, Vic, Mash, as well as Dazdraperma and Sovereigns one account.  The profiles put the appropriate pictures and of course links to the "home page".  That's where naive comrades are waiting for network worms of all stripes.  Almost nothing needs to be done - add them to your friends, and they will click.  It is also good for the bot to generate unpretentious girly thoughts and in the same place from time to time to pop up the necessary links to the necessary sites.  Fortunately, in order to save space, all links are encrypted and it is impossible to distinguish suspicious looking. <br><br>  <b>Centralization of current topics</b> <br>  Twitter needs accompanying community resources that would allow to somehow allocate and rank lists of relevant topics, or the hottest accounts.  Returning to the hashtag <a href="http://search.twitter.com/search%3Fq%3D%26ands%3D%26phrase%3D%26ors%3D%26nots%3D%26tag%3Dmetro29%26lang%3Dru%26from%3D%26to%3D%26ref%3D%26near%3D%26within%3D1000%26units%3Dmi%26since%3D%26until%3D%26rpp%3D20"># metro29</a> - someone knew how to work with him and most importantly how to find him, so he was in the subject, but most did not know and, for this reason also, generated new information trash.  Some attempts of centralization are already present both <a href="http://www.rutwitter.com/">with us</a> and <a href="http://muckrack.com/">with them</a> (attention! Respect and niche is not occupied!) <br><br><h3>  findings </h3><br>  Twitter is a dummy, but this is a trend.  It is far ambiguous.  It is similar to an intermediate link, anticipating the birth of some special whether a way of life, or a service of a new generation that uses the biological needs of the body and successfully satisfies them.  It is not clear yet. <br><br><h3>  Applications </h3><br>  <a href="http://www.ruformator.ru/news/article0630C/default.asp">Russian Twitter: virtualization</a> - numbers, names, trends of Russian Twi-community <br><br>  <a href="http://echo.msk.ru/programs/tochka/647632-echo/">"The growing popularity of Twitter"</a> in the transfer of Alexander Ivy to the radio "Echo of Moscow" <br><br>  Video: <a href="http://www.russia.ru/video/zs_9356/">Twitter talk</a> on Russia channel </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/90331/">https://habr.com/ru/post/90331/</a></p>
