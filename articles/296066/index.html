A utility that can make life easier for staff service managers and their subordinates by unloading them from routine work.  "Invented" - of course, loudly said.  It would be more correct to call it ‚Äúresponded to the demands of the market‚Äù, which at the time of the generation of the idea was represented by two employees of the same company.  One of them was the head of personnel service, who was keen to optimize work processes in the department under his control, and the other was a technical executor of the upcoming optimization.  It so happened that this second one was me. <a name="habracut"></a>

      The fateful conversation took place at dinner. <br><br>  <i>‚ÄúThis is not a thing at all,</i> ‚Äù he said suddenly, angrily blowing on a spoon with a grub, ‚Äúwe <i>sew up in a natural way.‚Äù</i>  <i>Now here are ten people need to take, and the candidates - hundreds.</i>  <i>Today, four will come to interview - so on the part of rush.</i>  <i>And then there will be more ... Call everyone - time is appointed, the location map has arrived, call back, make sure that it will come on time.</i>  <i>And then suddenly it does not work - we reassign it.</i>  <i>In general, we spend time on some nonsense.</i>  <i>Believe it or not, there is no time to sit in Odnoklassniki,</i> - in the hope of sympathy, he looked into my eyes wistfully. <br><br>  I nodded knowingly with my mouth full. <br><br>  Suddenly, his eyes clouded with a dream: - <i>Can you do such a crap to me so that the applicants somehow themselves recorded to me for an interview?</i>  <i>Well, like, we call the right candidate for an interview, and he chooses his own time.</i>  <i>How in the clinic electronic record?</i> <br><br>  <i>‚ÄúWhy don‚Äôt you do it,</i> ‚Äù I said slowly, estimating the amount of work, <i>time is needed.</i> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/418/39b/733/41839b7334734ed8b5d5591684063cc7.jpg"><br><br>  <i>- Three days is enough ?!</i>  - he looked at me hopefully and winked conspiratorially, - <i>you will push, brother, and I will mention the prize to you before you know who you are.</i> <br><br>  <i>- It is necessary to tinker, of course ... But it is necessary - it means it is necessary.</i>  <i>If anything, I work from home so that I don‚Äôt waste</i> my <i>time on the road, there was a</i> note of dedication in my voice. <br><br>  On that and decided.  By evening, everything was ready for me, but I did not hurry with the report and went home, looking forward to the unexpectedly long weekend. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/2b3/dde/694/2b3dde694bb545ba8fe1df4f31e4aa80.jpg"><br><br>  ... On Monday morning, he flew into my office, beaming with triumph and full of new ideas.  I also enjoyed a weekend skiing as a reward for my work, I also liked it very much - his enthusiasm soon passed on to me too.  Further more.  Awareness of the importance of the mission rolls over.  At some point, we began to feel like Moses, carrying tablets to the Jews. <br><br>  ... The widget I made on the corporate website gradually acquired additional functions.  We were filled with pride - we did the necessary and good deed.  The idea of ‚Äã‚Äãcreating an automated recording platform for an interview was born on this positive wave - a convenient and necessary working tool not only for our personnel officers, but also for all members of the profession. <br><br>  Our product is aimed at efficiently planning the time of HR specialists and eliminating them from the daily working routine - scheduling interviews with a tight schedule, individually agreeing on the time of meeting with each candidate, sending him a driving plan, postponing the interview due to possible force majeure of the applicant and much other. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/a6d/587/c02/a6d587c0256b47e0ab8128ce56eb9f83.jpg"><br><br>  It is not necessary to generalize our service with Headhunter and other recruitment sites.  Sign up.com is NOT an online recruitment tool for employers and a job search service for candidates.  Rather, it is a functional extension for such services, a reliable assistant that removes some of the professional concerns of managers and personnel recruitment services and simplifies their interaction with applicants.  The latter are also not bad - they are given the opportunity to independently choose the time of the interview, to relate it to their other plans. <br><br>  The service is as easy to use for both parties.  After a simple registration procedure, the employer creates and places the necessary vacancy on the Register.com website, appoints managers responsible for the selection of personnel.  Management of settings and vacancies is carried out in your account.  An employer can also get accurate statistics for each HR manager on his interviews. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/841/6d9/b46/8416d9b469bb458d96fcc88a9a183d9b.jpg"><br><br>  <b>There are two ways of self-recording for an interview:</b> <br><br>  1. The applicant will receive from Euchara a link to the recording page on the website Record.com. <br>  2. Through the widget that we provide, which the employer places on his website. <br><br>  In both cases, the candidate opens the recording window for an interview with one click and selects the time convenient for himself and for the HR manager on one of the proposed days. <br><br>  All the information needed by the potential recruit (date, time and contact person) is in his personal account.  Cancel or postpone the interview if necessary, you can here.  This is done in a few clicks. <br><br>  As you can see, the functionality is very laconic.  But, as shown by operational testing, the use of the service can increase the efficiency of the recruitment service several times.  Especially when she has to deal with a large number of applicants. <br><br>  Over time, through constant updates, our utility has become quite a useful tool.  Now he, for the most part, lacks one thing - the testing of his qualities by a wide range of users for whom he, in fact, was created. <br><br>  Today is the day.  <b><a href="http://xn--80anea7ao1c8a.com/">Get acquainted!</a></b> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/282/2ed/08a/2822ed08a67d4921b04da9e1f827eceb.jpg"><br><br>  On the invention of the wheel, we do not claim.  It is possible that such applied tools exist, at least we know nothing about them.  We will be grateful both for ideas for new, useful features of our platform, and for constructive criticism. <br><br>  Using the service is absolutely free.  We have the strength and financial capacity to develop the project further, to add to it a new functionality that is of interest to HR specialists.  Feedback from users - perhaps the only thing we urgently need at this stage.  Therefore, we are here. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/296066/">https://habr.com/ru/post/296066/</a></p>
