And exactly the same I have a question: what is your business? <br><br>  Let's forget that we are IT managers and manage cool storage systems, server farms, mail servers and look at all this confusion.  Consider the commercial structure. <br><br>  <b>1. What does your company do?</b>

      Forget the production of toilet paper, pants or even aircraft engines. <br><br>  The correct answer is: it produces money.  And so that the money produced was obtained more than the spent money. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/97d/a0a/ac4/97da0aac452624a7aef0ec28b79a55ed.png" width="432" height="308" alt="image"></div><a name="habracut"></a><br>  <b>2. Who makes money?</b> <br><br>  And they are produced by the very "stupid users" who are asked to press any key of the great and powerful technomage.  In fact, a technomagn is so large that it cannot read instructions in English (the working language of IT), and for Russian it is already too large. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="http://i.piccy.info/i9/7e04905c20cd0a6657b935d0da06c83a/1482139551/28661/1011492/buhgalter_500.jpg" alt="image"></div><br>  <b>3. With what help do they make money?</b> <br><br>  Money is also generated using IT services, including mail servers for communication with customers, the Internet, accounting systems, bookkeeping, etc.  In the process of making money, IT services consume IT resources ‚Äî raw power (processors / RAM / storage), licenses, channels. <br><br>  <b>4. Who owns the IT infrastructure and resources?</b> <br><br>  Here, time after time, I stumble upon the fact that administrators are beginning to consider servers, storage systems and switches - "their own."  At least a little, but they begin to treat them accordingly. <br><br>  The correct answer is: they belong to the company (the owner of the company) and must fulfill their task of generating money. <br><br>  <b>5. And now - who should decide how much resources a business unit employee can consume?</b> <br><br>  As it seems to me, this absolutely should not be an IT admin.  Just because he has no idea how these resources bring in money. <br><br>  Resource consumption should be unrestricted by IT, with virtually zero IT weight in making decisions about allocating resources to IT infrastructure.  Except maybe moments when a sudden increase in consumption can put the entire infrastructure in its entirety. <br><br>  An internal billing system is needed, which instead of restricting consumption simply sends an invoice to the head of department and fin at the end of the month.  Director of who and how many resources consumed.  In rubles.  Just because it is these two people who understand what share of the profit the employee generates and how much resources he needs to generate this profit. <br><br>  Of course you can argue on several points at once.  Let's consider them. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/82c/068/9a7/82c0689a755c9e378a55dd011e355c84.jpg" width="500" height="458" alt="image"></div><br>  <b>1. If you do not limit social.</b>  <b>network, then instead of working, everyone will just sit in contact.</b> <br><br>  May be.  But is this your area of ‚Äã‚Äãresponsibility and knowledge?  The employee has a boss who assesses the quality of his work.  Perhaps, of course, it is the chief who asks Ivan Ivanovich Ivanov to cut off access to social services.  networks ‚Äî but this is his decision making sphere.  Maybe this will be an information security policy, but again, this is not an admin solution. <br><br>  <b>2. They are brainless and do not understand anything in IT.</b>  <b>And they do not think at all that their funny pictures and vidyushki in email attachments will completely eat storage for mail.</b> <br><br>  Well, that's what you are, brave and understanding.  Only here there is again an interesting moment, nothing brings up a person as quickly and efficiently as the impact on his wallet.  Once all stay in the marketing department without a premium because they spent 90% of the space consumed in the mail on pictures - and their computer literacy / common sense will increase dramatically.  And most importantly, the head of department, left without a premium, will be stimulated by their native and understandable methods.  Their entire premium will be spent on expanding the storage system. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://citifox.ru/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/kompyuternyiy-ekspert-1.jpg" width="500" height="353" alt="image"></div><br>  <b>3. We have a limited budget in IT and we cannot allow them any resources they want.</b> <br><br>  Allow me, but this is a classic example of "the administrative problem is not solved by technical means."  The problem with budget planning / economic justification for procurement in the classical model is an administrative problem at the level of the Directorate, and not the admin.  Moreover, with the help of billing, the question of justifying budgets is solved much easier. <br><br>  There is another side to resource constraints.  You stop controlling what is happening in the company.  Users are beginning to delete important mail in fact, because they cannot receive a new one.  Important documents are in the clouds, correspondence is moved from corporate mail to Yandex and Mail.ru.  In other words, it is the blind repressive method that is the creator of the ‚Äúshadow IT‚Äù. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/18a/983/21f/18a98321ff52c27c47c96aaf48d664a2.jpg" width="500" height="333" alt="image"></div></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/331558/">https://habr.com/ru/post/331558/</a></p>
