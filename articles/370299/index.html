Sites for a long time well earned on advertising.  The more clicks and impressions they collected, the more money they received from advertisers.  At the same time, their visitors were left with nothing.  Worse, they are closely watched.  Their personal data and information about the behavior on the site are carefully collected, and sometimes sold.  Users may be victims of malware embedded in harmless advertisements.  Their involvement is a valuable commodity, but they themselves do not have a cent from it. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  Sites also suffer.  They can be deceived by advertising platforms, deceived by malicious bots that will click on their own ads.  Abuses are possible everywhere. <br><br>  ‚ÄúAdvertising platforms are completely unregulated and there is no safe way to do this.  There is no cryptographic protocol that would guarantee that the ad is shown on a real page and that the existing user saw it, ‚Äùlaments Brendan Eich, founder and CEO of <a href="https://www.brave.com/">Brave Software</a> .

      Eich believes that all these problems cause damage to digital advertising.  He would like to find a solution, because now there are many new technologies that solve many such problems: for example, by issuing <a href="http://www.cryptorussia.ru/zametki/chto-takoe-cifrovye-tokeny">digital tokens</a> in the blockchain. <br><br>  A new token called Basic Attention Token (BAT) announced yesterday will be integrated into the Brave browser.  It will allow users to earn cryptocurrency for viewing ads.  Like most similar tokens, it will exist on the basis of Ethereum, a popular blockchain platform with open source code.  Primary financing is expected to be obtained through the crowd sale of the first batch of tokens within a month. <br><br>  Brendan Eich, co-founder and former CEO of Mozilla, as well as the creator of the programming language JavaScript, plans to finance his new development by selling 70% of new tokens within the crowdfunding company.  Another 15% will be assigned to Brave and frozen for 6 months.  In the future they are supposed to be used for additional financing of the project.  The remaining 15% is planned to be distributed among existing Brave users. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/06a/456/83a/06a45683a4bf4336836db3a0b61fb6c0.jpg"><br><br>  Such massive sales, known as <a href="http://startup.today/article-chto-takoe-ico-ili-kraudfanding-2-0">Initial Coin Placement</a> (ICO), are becoming an increasingly popular method of raising funds for startups and open source projects.  Only last week, news appeared that <a href="http://blockchain.capital/">Blockchain Capital</a> , a venture capital firm, plans to release its own token in April in order to raise $ 10 million for a new fund. <br><br>  In 2016, a total of $ 236 million was collected in dozens of ICOs.  Brock Pierce, managing partner of Blockchain Capital, claims that we will see hundreds of such placements this year.  In legal circles, there have been allegations that some of these proposals may involve the sale of unregistered securities, but the US federal authorities have so far refused to intervene. <br><br>  As Internet users are increasingly confronted with the negative aspects of traditional online advertising, the popularity of various blocking software is gradually increasing.  According to recently published Brave Software data, ad blockers such as uBlock Origin and Disconnect are now present on more than 600 million computers and mobile devices around the world. <br><br>  Browser Browser has raised the issue of ad blocking to a new level.  When it was launched in public beta, in the summer of 2016, as a quick alternative to Google Chrome and other browsers, but without ads.  Ad blocking is built out of the box in Brave.  According to Brendan Eich, this feature allows you to load pages 3-8 times faster on devices running iOS, compared to the speed that Chrome provides. <br><br>  But now Eich wants to offer better free cheese. <br><br>  As part of the new blockchain-based advertising platform, he assumes that users who agree to receive advertising will also agree to give out information about their involvement, and for this they will be rewarded with BAT tokens.  Machine learning algorithms will further process their behavior graph to show less advertising, but make it much more relevant. <br><br>  According to Eich, the method of storing this data will differ from what has been accepted now: user data will be encrypted and stored locally, in the service area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe browser, without transferring it to Brave or to third parties.  Blockchain will not store separate profiles, but aggregated figures and interesting trends to ensure greater transparency of the advertising market. <br><br>  Publishers, in turn, earn BAT tokens when users are viewing advertisements, receiving a reward.  Brave plans to work with <a href="https://www.coinbase.com/">Coinbase</a> and similar companies to handle the conversion of cryptocurrency into customary money.  Advertisers will pay in dollars. <br><br>  In his interview, Eich spoke about the token as a necessary, but insufficient condition for the transformation of the online advertising market: ‚ÄúWe will solve several problems and the token is only part of the solution,‚Äù he said, ‚Äúbut the token is crucial because it makes the user a subject of the market.  You need a unit of account, which will return the cost to the user himself. " <br><br>  Brave has not yet set a target for the crowdfunding campaign.  Eich says that the company is waiting for the <a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/ethereum/">price</a> stabilization of <a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/ethereum/">ETH</a> - cryptocurrency, which investors will exchange for BAT-tokens with participation in ICO. <br><br>  This is not the first time that Brave is trying to help publishers.  From the outset, the browser prompted users to support content creators that they like by sending micropayments from <a href="https://blog.brave.com/introducing-brave-payments/">the Brave payment system</a> .  Once the wallet is set up, the user can fund it with an existing bitcoin wallet and send payments anonymously.  At the moment, Brave users have created 48,000 wallets, and more than 200 publishers have registered, says Eich. <br><br>  Eich admits that Brave can get involved in an unequal battle when he convinces the sites to use his platform.  Moreover, to put it mildly, they are not enthusiastic about his decision, enable ad blocking in their browser.  But according to Aich, to adhere to the current ‚Äústatus quo‚Äù is generally unacceptable for the sites themselves, even if some wish to stay away. <br><br>  ‚ÄúThe most advanced ad blockers recognize this as a given and don‚Äôt try to discriminate against a cohort of their users,‚Äù he said.  "This is a growing segment, but many sites still prefer to go upwind." </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/370299/">https://habr.com/ru/post/370299/</a></p>
