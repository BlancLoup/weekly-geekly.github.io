For those who want to understand how to create technology startups with an eye on global leadership, the first European <a href="http://techpeaks.eu/">The People Accelerator has</a> opened <a href="http://techpeaks.eu/">- Tech Peaks</a> .  The main goal of this program is to open access to the international market for ICT entrepreneurs from Eastern Europe. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  The Tech Peaks professional environment is created precisely to quickly test your ideas in practice with the help of insiders and visionaries of the market: mentors, serial entrepreneurs, investors, service providers, corporate representatives, accelerators, research laboratories and media. <br><br>  Tech Peaks is the entry point to the global startup ecosystem for both talented professionals with no ideas, and for teams with ready-made projects where they can interact with a whole network of accelerator partners: Founders Institute (USA), Seedcamp (Europe), Mind the Bridge (England), Eleven (Bulgaria), H-Farm (Italy), Geekaccelerator (Romania), iCatapult (Hungary), Plug &amp; Play Russia and many others. <br><br><blockquote>  ‚Äú <a href="http://plugandplayrussia.com/techpeaks.html">Plug &amp; Play Russia joined the initiative of Tech Peaks - The People Accelerator</a> ,‚Äù says Arkady Moreynis, head of Plug &amp; Play Russia, ‚Äúbecause we believe in this idea, though ambitious, but topical on the European and Russian markets!  The main question now is whether Tech Peaks can effectively convert the received talents from IT, design and business into the founders of successful startups with a global goal.

      The venue is located right in the middle of the Italian Alps, the city of Trento, one of the most technologically advanced territories in Europe, where a number of research laboratories, the university and European innovation centers are concentrated. <br><br><h5>  The essence and possibilities of the program </h5><br>  Tech Peaks selects 100 technology, design, and business talents from the Balkans and from Eastern Europe, Ukraine, Belarus, and Russia.  Participants in the six-month program receive: <br><br>  ‚Ä¢ Semi-annual visa in Italy (for non-EU citizens) <br>  ‚Ä¢ Covering the cost of food and accommodation for the duration of the program. <br>  ‚Ä¢ Comfortable place to work on a startup <br>  ‚Ä¢ Monthly pocket money in the amount of 500 euros per person <br><br>  After the first intensive month of the program, in which a series of seminars and practical lectures on the Lean StartUp Machine methodology will take place, all participants, united in teams, can present their ideas to a professional jury of mentors and investors. <br><br>  In case of victory, the team receives a grant in the amount of 25 thousand euros without any return of the share in its startup.  This money is allocated to participants in the Trento region for business development in the remaining five months of the Tech Peaks program. <br><br>  Mentors of the Tech Peaks program are professional professionals who have experience in creating successful businesses and investing.  Their main task will be to share insights and visions of the global market with participants, as well as help start-ups in development. <br><br>  Here are the first ones (the list will be updated): <br><br>  ‚Ä¢ <b>Andy Parsons</b> , co-founder / CTO ‚ÄúHappify‚Äù, a specialist with 15 years of experience in developing software structures <br>  ‚Ä¢ <b>Obie Fernandez</b> , bestselling author, CTO "Lean StartUp Machine" <br>  ‚Ä¢ <b>Vladimir Oane</b> , co-founder of UberVU - the best platform for monitoring and interactive communication in social media according to Forbes Global 2000 marketing departments <br>  ‚Ä¢ <b>Renaud Visage</b> , co-founder and CTO "Eventbrite", <br>  ‚Ä¢ <b>Rebecca Paoletti</b> , co-founder of CakeWorks, a leading European expert in digital media with more than 17 years of experience in the development and monetization of video production <br>  ‚Ä¢ <b>Evan Nisselson</b> , investor and mentor in Seedcamp accelerators, 500 start-ups, Mind the Brindge <br>  ‚Ä¢ <b>Peter Stern</b> , Web Designer, Newport News Shipbuilding <br>  ‚Ä¢ <b>Jeremiah Robinson</b> , VP Software "Jawbone" <br>  ‚Ä¢ <b>Arkady Moreynis</b> , Head of Plug &amp; Play Russia, investor and mentor <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/78b/979/793/78b97979308d2a9acd2135c81eac69ab.png"><br><br>  Those startups that will be able to attract angel or venture capital investments in the project within 12 months after the completion of the program will also have the opportunity to participate in the second phase of Tech Peaks in co-financing of up to 200 thousand euros. <br><br><h5>  Who should participate? </h5><br>  Age of participants 18+.  You have the skills and knowledge in technology, design or business that are able to confirm with completed projects or work experience.  If you have a great idea to create a product - this is a plus, but not a prerequisite. <br><br>  If you are a start-up team, then in order to successfully pass the selection process, you need to show how well you can work together, as well as lucidly explain the essence of your idea, show a prototype / solution.  The main thing that is important for every participant in the program is passion for entrepreneurship, the desire and ambition to build a truly innovative business.  You must have a flexible mindset, see beyond the framework, be able to easily adapt to the new environment and people, be a leader, but also be responsible for what you did with your own hands.  Tech Peaks is a challenge for those who want to try and develop! <br><br>  <a href="http://techpeaks.eu/">Applications are accepted until April 5 at Tech Peaks website</a> , where you must fill out a participant's application form and record a three-minute video with an answer to questions about why, for example, you want to get on this program. <br><br>  And on March 16 in Digital October there <a href="http://digitaloctober.ru/events/the_startup_kids_otkuda_berutsya_startapery">will be an official presentation of Tech Peaks</a> with a screening of the famous film ‚ÄúThe StartUp Kids‚Äù about the history of the founders of the leading startups SoundCloud, Dropbox, Vimeo, Foodspotting and others. <br><br><h5>  Program organizers </h5><br>  The ideologists and founders of the Tech Peaks program are the organization Trento RISE, whose task is to do everything possible to turn the Trento region into an innovative and comfortable environment for entrepreneurs and investors, as well as the FBK Information Technology Center, which unites more than 350 graduate students and doctors in educational activities - researchers from around the world. <br><br>  Also, the Tech Peaks program works in close partnership with EIT Labs (European Institute for Innovation and Technology) - the largest professional community, organized on the principle of innovation clusters in leading EU cities, under the leadership of the European Commission.  Its mission is the development of ICT and support of small and medium-sized businesses for economic growth and raising the standard of living in Europe. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/171935/">https://habr.com/ru/post/171935/</a></p>
