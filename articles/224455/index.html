The problem is that users ignore texts on the web more and more often - the eyes spoiled by graphics prefer to cling to beautiful pictures and icons, the form of presentation becomes more and more important.  If the visitor read the text, the probability of the order increases several times.  How to attract visitors to the text and help to read?  It is necessary to concentrate on the most important, to place accents correctly, to arrange beautifully and invite to action.  Why if everyone understands this, no one (or almost no one) pays any attention to it? <br><br>  Many find it difficult to form in their head a clear and beautiful structure of the text and embody it on the site by means of a control panel.  It was for them that we formed a simple template.  Paste it into a WYSIWYG editor, replace text, pictures - and voila! <a name="habracut"></a>

Try in it in an understandable language in three sentences to tell about what and for whom your service.  Avoid common phrases.  Be specific.  After reading the first paragraph, a person must understand the essence and be ready to make an order, if this is what he was looking for.  All subsequent paragraphs are pre-sales if a simple, clear description of the service is not enough. <br><br>  <b>Call for action</b> <br><br>  If a site visitor, having read some of your text, is already ready to send a request, help him do it in all convenient ways.  Go to the order form, phone numbers, office address - all that is relevant for ordering a particular service.  The price (or the order of the price) and the comment to it also contribute to quick decision making.  It is better to duplicate this plate several times on the page. <br><br>  <strong>Describe what is included in the service</strong> <br><br>  In the second paragraph, briefly describe what is included in the service.  Form a comprehensive understanding of the visitor that he will receive as a result of working with you.  Here we must also be very specific and avoid phrases such as ‚Äúan individual approach to each client.‚Äù  A set of clear values ‚Äã‚Äãthat the client will receive and what the generalized result of these values ‚Äã‚Äãwill result for the client. <br><br>  <strong>List your benefits</strong> <br><br>  In the third part you can already talk about your merits (we begin to strengthen the sale).  Start with points of similarity with market leaders (what everyone has) and add some specific advantages over competitors (points of difference).  If they are not, then think up, but do not speak common words.  Highlight this in separate bullets to make it easier to read.  Try to select no more than 6‚Äì8 points of advantages. <br><br>  <strong>Describe how you work</strong> <br><br>  Describe step by step in a few sentences how you build the work.  This helps the client to present the process and will increase the credibility of you.  This text should not be selling.  He must show your professionalism.  Tell us about quality control, how you manage to meet the deadlines, etc. At the end, invite to cooperate.  The purpose of this paragraph is to form an idea of ‚Äã‚Äãthe process for the client - from the call up to the moment the result is obtained.  Just do not forget about brevity. <br><br>  <strong>Pin feedback from customers</strong> <br><br>  Now is the time to put an end.  The client at this moment lacks very little to push the ‚ÄúOrder‚Äù button.  The client now needs to convince himself not to waste time on further searches.  This will help him reviews your customers.  Put in the last part of the description of the service 2-3 reviews.  This will be enough for the request / order to take place. <br><br>  If your services are described by this template, the growth in the number of requests will not take long to wait. <br><br>  One last thing: it is better to purchase images on drains or in icon stores.  It will save you time, and it will be more pleasant for the reader to contemplate high-quality, not jagged pictures. <br><br>  I would be glad if our decision would be useful. <br><br>  Vasily Churanov and <a href="http://www.web-canape.ru/">WebCanape team</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/224455/">https://habr.com/ru/post/224455/</a></p>
