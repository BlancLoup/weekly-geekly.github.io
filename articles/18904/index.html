  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Employee search with help</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  In the autumn, it seems, I was ordered an article about working sites, but the publication ordered me to live long.  I sighed with relief: the topic seemed boring.  But in December, due to a change in working conditions, for the first time in my life I needed to recruit staff to my department (also the first in my life).  What started here!  Despite the fact that Yandex knows <a href="http://yaca.yandex.ru/yca/ungrp/cat/Employment/Jobs/">362</a> sites with vacancies and resumes, and Rambler has <a href="">500</a> such sites, the overwhelming majority of them are bad experiences of recruitment agencies and students.  But even the most popular working sites can hardly be called the best friends of managers.  I armed myself with my notes to that article and decided to figure out what I hope for on the Internet, a ‚Äúsmall employer,‚Äù without money and connections. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/olpictures/7da/e1f/057/7dae1f0578e2e9f4136f5b355888af4d.gif" width="450" height="196" hspace="10" vspace="10"><br><br><a name="habracut"></a>

      The ‚Äúcareer start-ups‚Äù parade will probably not end soon: the online recruiting market, <a href="http://www.telnews.ru/theme/15319">according to experts</a> , is 15-20 million dollars, and employers spend on personnel advertising by about 100% per year.  True, new work sites are usually clones of existing ones, often of inferior quality.  What, for example, is <a href="http://gojobs.ru/">Gojobs.ru</a> (branch of the Polish leader Pracuj.pl) opened in the fall of Raboty.ru opened in the fall?  Probably the fact that the affiliate site is slower loading pages, and the placement of ads is paid.  Meaningfully, these are regular vacancies and resumes, an industry directory, articles on the subject, internal mail. <br><br>  The need for job sites is, of course, relative.  For recruitment agencies and Eychara large companies recruiting on the Internet - only one of the possibilities.  Another thing is for project managers (departments), who usually have no money for advertising vacancies or agency services.  And if the company has a Eychar, then its role will most likely be auxiliary: placing ads, calling candidates.  Still, it seems to me that for the majority of middle managers, sites are the main tool for selection (the circle of friends and relatives loses to the Internet in the number of candidates). <br>  The effectiveness of working sites is increasingly evaluated by managers deeply unprintable.  Leonid Belikov, the project manager of the <a href="http://mamba.ru/">Mamba.ru</a> dating <a href="http://mamba.ru/">system</a> , put it on the subject of non-political correctness, but it‚Äôs very characteristic: ‚ÄúWhat are online recruitment projects, other than dull shit, you don‚Äôt name.  The big players (Jobs.ru, Headhunter, Job.ru), whose services I‚Äôm no longer trying to use, are essentially machines for transferring leaflets with vacancies and resumes between an employee and an employer. ‚Äù  The powerlessness of work sites could be justified by demography or the past year of the pig, if their functions were not to take on social networks, and quite successfully. <br><br>  <strong>1. Sites for employment</strong> <br><br>  I asked the managers of the departments of my company (a marketing agency) who regularly post vacancy announcements.  Responses for the first four days after the publication were taken into account - the normal life of the ad, if it is not updated.  The only thing: I pointed out to colleagues the sites that, in my opinion, are the best.  Choosing the "best" is the question.  The statistics themselves working sites, of course, does not fit.  Monitoring outside organizations is often questionable due to their incompetence.  For example, in the <a href="http://www.romir.ru/news/res_results/363.html">personnel survey of</a> ‚ÄúRomir‚Äù there are formulations: ‚Äúa specialized Internet portal‚Äù (‚Äúportal‚Äù is universal) or ‚Äúto search for vacancies through search engines‚Äù (this is not the case).  The measure of the site‚Äôs popularity for me is the number of page views (hits).  Logic: the more pages are viewed by users, the more interesting the site.  Top-100 "Rambler" often gives the following three leaders (sometimes SuperJob and Joblist are wedged in): <br><br>  1. <a href="http://hh.ru/">Headhunter</a> <br>  Initially the site is middle and top management.  The first-class has faded for some time: the site is becoming massive.  For example, the Afisha publishing house, whose Eychar is Maya Kozlova finding 80% of candidates with the help of the twentieth, also closes secretarial vacancies in the reception room.  I, too, should be happy: only from PR managers there are 38 responses (see the table with the results of the publication of announcements).  Cons of the site: actually paid placement of vacancies, restrictions on direct communication with candidates (communication by internal mail on the site), frequent disruptions.  Inconvenient interfaces, add from myself.  Sergey Mathisen, who is preparing to launch a career service Whatdoyoudo.ru, once said: ‚ÄúHeadhunter is a cumbersome machine that makes you feel pathos.‚Äù <br>  2. <a href="http://rabota.ru/">Work</a> <br>  "Hypermarket vacancies and resume."  The optimal working site, if we relate its technical features, effectiveness and free of charge of the main options among themselves.  To me, Jobs.ru brought in some sense an even greater result than Headhunter. ‚Äù  For example: one response after 4 ad views for a PHP programmer for the first one versus one after 31 views for the second.  But there are more negative reviews about Rabota.ru than positive ones.  ‚ÄúThe site takes the reach and integration of the largest possible number of related services, says Sergey Mathisen, as a result - a jumble of very different things, which leads to low efficiency. <br><br>  3. <a href="http://job.ru/">Jobe</a> <br>  The first mass run site in runet, which was the leader in attendance for ten years, until September 2007, is, perhaps, all the good things about this dinosaur.  Job is weakly moderated and looks awful.  His new version, while in test mode, is puzzling: almost the second Jobs.ru.  The site is perceived not even as a base, but as junk garbage.  Maya Kozlova admitted: I almost never use it.  To be honest, perfect inefficiency.  Except in rare cases when we have vacancies for couriers. <br><br>  Eychary mention other sites that we have not checked.  For example, the fourth major player is <a href="http://superjob.ru/">Superjob</a> .  ‚ÄúWith his help (in conjunction with Headhunter) we close from 25 to 70% of our vacancies (it all depends on the specifics of the order).  In particular, Superjob is good for finding specialists in construction, ‚Äùsaid Olga Tretyakova, advertising and PR manager at Vivat Personnel.  There are small specialized sites.  For example, web designers are often searched using the Guild of Periodical Press Publishers website, accountants at Bookkeeping.ru, Klerke.ru and Posting.ru, etc. <br><br>  But for a line manager, a working site is not a solution.  I am silent, that in addition to the responses you will be overwhelmed with spam and that the professional level and degree of responsibility of many candidates can lead to despair.  (I personally saw the rating of professions that applicants are interested in on one very large site: drivers and nannies prevailed).  In my opinion, the main thing is that the ideology of the work sites itself is flawed.  They still remain databases, plus a couple of decorative options.  Yes, it is possible to receive responses to your ad in a certain amount and independently view tons of resumes, but without an interview you cannot say anything about a person.  After all, one of the most effective criteria for choosing a subordinate is sympathy: ‚ÄúI am pleased to work with a person or teach him.‚Äù  The concept of a working site does not even involve close acquaintances or absentee evaluations of candidates.  The recruitment process turns into a series of painful meetings with rejection of candidates.  And the culling can and should occur on the Internet. <br><br>  <strong><a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blog/i_am_clever/34190.html">Continuation</a></strong> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/18904/">https://habr.com/ru/post/18904/</a></p>
