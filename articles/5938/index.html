  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Beggar Runet</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  It‚Äôs as if the webmaster won‚Äôt boast that he is doing his project exclusively for himself and his dear visitors, and I don‚Äôt want to miss the opportunity to earn a lot of money.  So we have to honest workers of the network space spin between the chance to sell advertising space on the resource and their promise: ‚Äúthey say, everything is for you and I don‚Äôt need money‚Äù. <br>  As a result, we see that some of the owners of these sites set off into the capitalist current and live happily ever after, wondering how the second part of dedicated webmasters barely make ends meet and begins to "beg". <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  <b>Donate!</b> <br><br>  Strangely enough, in the West, among the masters of the cyber-begging genre were not people from the street.  For example, the famous television producer Karin Bosnek, whose credit card debts in the amount of 20 thousand dollars were formed on June 23, 2002.  Not flustered, Bosnak created a site where she asked for help in paying off her debts.  And in less than six months she paid off her debts.  Another example: the writer Stephen King, who in 2000 published on his website the chapters of the novel ‚ÄúThe Plant‚Äù and offered every reader to voluntarily pay a dollar for a chapter.  On this, the writer earned more than half a million dollars, and even then complained that "there will not be enough."

      Ordinary cyber-proshiki begin with creating a section ‚ÄúDonate‚Äù on the site.  There you will see an inscription of the type: ‚ÄúNow you can become a sponsor of our project by sending any amount to the below details‚Äù.  The ‚ÄúDonate‚Äù section was firmly registered in web-resources with absolutely any attendance and subject matter.  And it doesn‚Äôt matter that, at best, the project‚Äôs account will get $ 30 collected during the year, and no one will see the details from Vasya Pupkin‚Äôs page.  The most important thing is to pay tribute to fashion. <br><br>  Also, with a probability of 50 to 50 (or see or not) in the section there will be a hidden begging of the form ‚Äúclick on the link and buy goods there‚Äù.  A sort of parody of the advertising manager will not bring big dividends.  But the idea that you are small, but still a partner of the brand, can not but warm self-esteem.  As an example, we can recall the story of Dmitry Davydov about using AdSense as an additional income: it was assumed that benefits on using the same AdSense are beneficial blog content. <br><br>  <b>Bank beggar as a service</b> <br><br>  Surveys show that many runet representatives would support the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãcollecting donations by owners of popular websites and blogs, if there were convenient tools for this.  Therefore, ‚Äúvoluntary donations‚Äù can be not only the last way of survival, but also a simple way of enrichment on the donation service itself. <br><br>  The main difficulty of the beggar‚Äôs banks is that it should be simple.  Even when the details of e-wallets are published in the Donate section, this requires the giver to perform a whole bunch of actions.  A person on the street you can give a ten, or at least a cigarette in one motion.  You will not go to the bank for the transfer of tens. <br><br>  The content provider for mobile phones, the company Movable, has provided webmasters the opportunity to take money from the visitor via SMS.  The sms.kopilka project positions itself as an interactive service that allows a person or a company to have at their disposal a convenient tool for assessing the loyalty of an audience to a publication, resource or individual project within the framework of the service provided through the ubiquitous SMS.  Simply speaking, the visitor sends to the short number everything that he thinks about your project, and you share the proceeds from this with Movable. <br><br>  And again, there is a hidden begging on the face that kills two birds with one stone: a non-commercial project brings a small, but profit, plus a ‚Äúown‚Äù SMS-service.  True, mobile operators take themselves half the money.  If more and services such "piggy banks" will take something - how much will reach the recipient? <br><br>  But a holy place is never empty.  Yandex is trying to occupy its niche in the begging section with a new project ‚ÄúGive me a ruble, friend!‚Äù.  Personally, the name of the project reminds me of the brand phrase of people who shoot money in the dark alley of hooligan people.  A description of the project in the corporate blog of Yandex only strengthens my opinion.  See for yourself: ‚ÄúYour readers can give you a ruble, three or five.  And the most diligent - even a million rubles. ‚ÄùAnd if you drive seriously, they can give you a car, probably ... <br><br>  Jokes - jokes, while transferring a Yandex.Money system fee - 0.5% of the payment amount.  So the wolves are fed and the sheep are intact, but the reader ... And the reader is probably waiting for a Google analogue like ‚ÄúOgooglet Give two!‚Äù. <br><br>  <b>Big game</b> <br><br>  The above methods are enough to, say, pay yourself cheap hosting.  But some individuals, looking at their accounts, mumble under their breath: ‚ÄúIt will not be enough!‚Äù ... and continue to beg.  Only in a big way.  The game is divided into two major categories.  The first is Nigerian letters, and the second is touching stories. <br><br>  Nigerian letters are a form of fraud and begging in one bottle.  The essence of such letters lies in the fact that their authors allegedly own huge accounts, inheritances, wealth and other values.  But bad luck - to get the desired millions, you need only a small amount for washing, creating a new bank account.  However, for what they are needed, it does not matter much for us.  Further, the plot of the letter develops according to the plan: they say, you transfer a small amount of money to me, and I immediately cash out and send you 40% of my wealth to you.  Tempting?  Then, with pride, transfer the amount to fraudsters, and then watch, aside, as you pass an expensive foreign car, bought naturally for your money. <br><br>  As for the "touching stories", everything is also simple here.  You receive a letter from a person with a serious illness or just a difficult fate that needs a certain amount of money.  It is difficult to refuse.  Therefore, even after reading and immediately removing such a letter, you will suffer in doubt: ‚ÄúWhat if it was not a hoax?‚Äù.  But I want to assure you that in 90% of cases it was he who was.  Therefore, if you want to provide charitable support to those who really need it, it‚Äôs better to use special funds. <br><br>  <b>Diagnosis: a form of communication?</b> <br><br>  Somehow, in the EZHE-list, parallels of the begging of the real and virtual world were somehow cited: if earlier donate tablets on sites were associated with beggars sitting on cartons with the words ‚ÄúHelp‚Äù, then the current methods of beggars are quite pathetic signs and billboards.  Now, people on the Internet are simply asking for a new Mercedes. <br><br>  However, if you don‚Äôt fall into the sin of envy and do not dwell on fraudulent schemes (after all, not all who ask are swindlers), you need to recognize that begging is becoming fashionable and in its own creative form of Internet communication.  And for Runet, this form of communication can become very popular.  Judge for yourselves: there are many needs in Russia, and there is no need to take on creativity.  Last year, the same Nigeria‚Äôs Internet spammers won the Gnobele Prize for Literature.  Will Russia with its rich literary traditions give way to such a palm?  We are not some kind of Nigeria there, we are more: ‚ÄúNigeria in the snow,‚Äù as the founder of Google said.  Just today Moscow just snowed up. <br><br>  And if such works, petitions will be realistic (which again distinguishes Russian literature), then there will be no problems with the laws.  What is wrong if people voluntarily give you money for your honestly described needs?  This is certainly no worse than deceiving others, selling them unnecessary things with advertising, which they did not ask for. <br><br>  In general, we will be waiting for the opening of domestic creative courses on the high art of Internet begging.  Separate manuals have already been published earlier: here is an example from the ‚ÄúNew News‚Äù, 2004.  True, as the author of the experiment mentioned, even the advanced idea of ‚Äã‚Äãbegging for money on behalf of a speaking chinchilla did not help him earn.  The problem was the same as mentioned above: there were no easy ways to pay.  Well, now at least there is a Yandex button for the ruble.  There will be others. <br><br>  Only, probably, it is worthwhile to correct the terminology in advance.  ‚ÄúAsking‚Äù, ‚Äúcollecting donations‚Äù - somehow sounds humiliating.  ‚ÄúAnd give me a ruble‚Äù - like hitting.  Maybe just call it "art of sharing"?  But then this is not a new service, but simply a return to the good old traditions of human society. <br>  P / S <br>  For Weblanet.ru <br></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/5938/">https://habr.com/ru/post/5938/</a></p>
