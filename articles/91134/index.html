Everyone also somehow encounters Windows in their lives.  Why is the iPad so successful, and Windows still starts with the start button?  Is it time for Microsoft to look around and re-make Windows, not the way we used to see it? <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h4>  Why do you need a new Windows? </h4><br>  You ask, isn't Windows 7 sophisticated enough, new and good?  Yes, in Win7 there is everything that is possible, except for simplicity.  Let's look at the trends in the personal computer industry. <br><br>  First of all, everything is moving towards mobilization, and this is not cheap.  At least, so <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2010/04/12/eric-schmidt-mobile-is-the-future-and-theres-no-such-thing-as-communication-overload/%26sl%3Den%26tl%3Dru">consider Google</a> and <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2010/02/23/tim-cook-apple-mobile-device-company/%26sl%3Den%26tl%3Dru">Apple</a> .  Even if they are wrong, these two companies, by their vision, will ‚Äúforce‚Äù the industry to move in this direction.

      Secondly, iron producers are trying in every possible way to get away from the ways of interaction with the computer, so beloved by us.  I will not talk about <a href="http://www.google.com/search%3Fhl%3Den%26q%3Daccelerometer%2Bdata%2Binput%26aq%3Df%26aqi%3D%26aql%3D%26oq%3D%26gs_rfai%3D">accelerometers</a> , compasses, <a href="http://www.engadget.com/search/%3Fq%3Dplaystation%2Bmove%26invocationType%3Dwl-gadget">video tracking</a> <a href="http://www.engadget.com/2010/01/03/microsoft-research-patents-controller-free-computer-input-via-em/">,</a> <a href="http://www.engadget.com/2008/06/09/smks-wireless-input-pen-lets-you-scribble-like-a-5-year-old/">etc.</a> Take at least a touchscreen.  Today, to deny the importance and significance of this kind of interaction is just silly.  And let's be honest with ourselves, what Windows does with a touchscreen is simply not serious, not to mention the potential of other input interfaces. <br><br>  Third, today a computer without the Internet is just a joke.  How does Windows use this opportunity to totally connect everything that you can imagine to the Internet?  Browser <b>?!</b>  Yes, we are all accustomed to the browser, but there are still so many great ways to use the global Internet connection right in the system!  Why not include <a href="http://www.zumodrive.com/">ZumoDrive</a> directly in the system?  Why not make a service that will send some of the complex calculations to the cloud so that the unfortunate Atom won't bend?  Such tweaks can come up with countless.  Just imagine how beautiful it would fit into the core of the system. <br><br>  Windows is good for a large computer with a keyboard on your desk, nothing more.  Iron producers have long been ready to enter the tablet market.  Lacking the right software.  Apple proved it with interest, selling 350,000 iPads on the first day.  At the same time, even without having <a href="http://www.google.com/search%3Fsourceid%3Dchrome%26ie%3DUTF-8%26q%3Diphone%2Bos%2Bmissing%2Bfeatures">such a good</a> OS.  What happens to the market if you release Windows specifically for tablets? <br><br><h4>  Why does not fit what is already there? </h4><br>  The Windows media center is a good attempt to bring the ‚Äúold rake‚Äù to a new level.  Unfortunately, the attempt failed.  Why does the whole Windows need on a TV, even if it is ‚Äúhidden‚Äù by a simple interface?  Are you still tired of the start button?  Is it time to leave it overboard, like Windows Mobile? <br><br>  On mobile devices, a fundamentally new approach to user interaction is needed.  Everyone has already seen, using the example of the iPhone, that people want everything simple, beautiful and convenient.  No one needs the Windows folder on the C: drive, nor the C: drive itself. <br><br>  Google understands all these trends, but they are too obsessed with the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãa global internet connection.  They correctly understood that the problem in the operating system of this kind is overdue and announced <a href="http://www.google.com/search%3Fhl%3Den%26q%3DChrome%2BOS%26aq%3Df%26aqi%3D%26aql%3D%26oq%3D%26gs_rfai%3D">Chrome OS</a> .  This is a good jump in the right direction, but too long.  People are not yet ready to completely abandon all the charms of locality.  Take the same 3D games.  Their implementation on the cloud is still too cheese, and the global Internet connection is not as fast.  Users need an intermediate stage of the operating system. <br><br><h4>  Potential </h4><br>  Microsoft has <b>all the</b> capabilities to create a similar operating system from scratch. <ul><li>  Human resources </li><li>  Ready development </li><li>  Always true, HUGE camp of third-party developers who are ready to support any initiative. </li><li>  Market impact </li><li>  "Iron" partners </li><li>  Money </li></ul>  The company also has the mental potential for such solutions: <br><br><h5>  Windows Phone 7 <s>Series</s> </h5>  Everyone knows that not so long ago, the guys from Microsoft simply ‚Äúthrew‚Äù Windows Mobile overboard.  What they are, so far, very proud.  This shows that the company has enough willpower to admit its global error, to abstract from local gain, ‚Äútake a step back‚Äù and start all over again. <br><br><h5>  Bing </h5>  Microsoft is not so bad at introducing innovations.  There was a Live Search, not much worse than others.  Nevertheless, the company, believing that this is not enough for further development, took and did everything anew, introducing a bunch of innovations into the usual search results.  And they did it quite well.  Of course, they didn‚Äôt overthrow Google, but now they have <a href="http://www.google.com/search%3Fsourceid%3Dchrome%26ie%3DUTF-8%26q%3Dbing%2Bsearch%2Bshare">10% of the search market</a> . <br><br><h4>  Conclusion </h4><br>  The stars are such that Microsoft has all the necessary maps in their hands, and while Apple is just as closed, Google and Linux are just as open, and <a href="https://thejoojoo.com/">Fusion Garage</a> is just as small, these cards will remain in the hands of Microsoft.  Whether Microsoft can risk a share of its core business, I do not think.  Steve Ballmer in the same <a href="http://www.engadget.com/2009/10/23/the-engadget-show-002-steve-ballmer-droid-nook-and-new-mac/">Engadget Show</a> made it clear that they will only experiment in ‚Äúsmall‚Äù markets, and where they are already successful and earn billions, they will continue to do what they do.  What should simple users do in this situation?  Waiting for a miracle from Microsoft, buying an iPad, uploading all your photos to Picass or joining Fusion Garage is up to you. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/91134/">https://habr.com/ru/post/91134/</a></p>
