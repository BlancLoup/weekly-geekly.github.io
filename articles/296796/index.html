And this year, buyers are faced with a number of problems associated with unscrupulous sellers. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Black Friday's <a href="http://www.blackfridaysale.ru/">website, blackfridaysale.ru</a> , was supposed to start its work yesterday at 19:00, but the site‚Äôs employees were able to reanimate it only two hours after the stated start time of the campaign.  Yes, and after that every now and then errors came out.  During the start of sales on the site, users could not find some sites that previously announced their participation in the promotion on blackfridaysale.ru.  <a href="http://www.enter.ru/">Enter</a> , <a href="http://www.lamoda.ru/">Lamoda,</a> and WildBerries turned out to be such a loss ‚Äî a search on the site did not find these sellers, but it was possible to find them on the site through Yandex. <br><br>  Sellers themselves are unhappy with the organization blackfridaysale.ru.  The first discontented reviews of sellers have already appeared on the Internet.  For example, the head of marketing for <a href="http://www.audiomania.ru/">Audiomania,</a> Timofey Shikolenkov, very unflatteringly speaks about Black Friday‚Äôs website in his post on Facebook, stressing that next year they will conduct it on their own.

      With regard to discounts (or rather, their "reality"), then here things are very sad.  Domestic Internet publications Oborot.ru and Hi-Tech@Mail.ru made comparisons of discount prices for some products presented at the sale, and found that often sellers significantly raised the price by Friday in advance.  From myself, I would like to add that <a href="http://www.amazon.com/">Amazon.com‚Äôs</a> ‚Äúgreat and terrible‚Äù sin also has this kind of sin: the technique I bought for $ 350 a month ago (and would have bought something else like that on a Friday sale) is worth $ 380 today. - yes, already with 50% "discount". <br><br>  I was also pleased with MediaMarkt, who earlier trumpet sales of the Oysters Arctic 450 smartphone, the normal price of which is 2,990 rubles. For only 99 rubles.  Advertising was shown on television, and of course, crowds of inspired shoppers rushed to purchase this marvel of technology in bundles.  However, <a href="https://www.mediamarkt.ru/">MediaMarkt</a> quickly came to his senses, changing the rules of the game on the go and stating that discount smartphones are available only in offline stores.  However, according to the statements of the buyers themselves, from there they are publicly sent to the online sale.  In short, the moral is: MediaMarkt got into a mess in the struggle for the attention of customers.  On the Internet there is information about hundreds of failed sales (or rather successful ones, and then canceled by the seller due to the lack of goods in stock) and only three (!) Cases of successful purchase of the ill-fated Oysters Arctic 450. <br><br>  Similar inflammation of cunning, only on a smaller scale, other sellers suffer ( <a href="http://www.ulmart.ru/">Yulmart</a> , for example), who already at the very start of sales did not have a discount product in stock, but sellers offered similar models, but without eye-catching discounts.  Apparently, Yulmart and such clever men decided that the main thing to attract a person was with a lure, and then on the wave of general shopping madness, he would still buy something. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/296796/">https://habr.com/ru/post/296796/</a></p>
