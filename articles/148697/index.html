Right!  We need someone who will pay us for our work on the Internet, namely advertisers who are interested in receiving an unlimited number of visitors to their site, and ultimately - the buyers of their product. <br><br>  <b>What are they willing to pay for?</b> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/8f9/378/8cd/8f93788cd92a2a2073777eaaba7e759c.jpg">

    <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  Of course, for each unique visitor, who will then necessarily become their client, preferably permanent. <br><br>  As you know, demand creates supply, and therefore, over the past few years, several models of working on the Internet with such advertisers have appeared: <br><br>  ‚Ä¢ CPM (Cost Per Thousand Impressions) - pay per 1000 impressions; <br>  ‚Ä¢ CPC (Cost Per Click) - payment for the transition to the advertiser's site; <br>  ‚Ä¢ CPA (Cost Per Action) - payment for an action that was performed by the user who has switched to the advertiser's site. <br><br>  Recently, advertising in RuNet, almost every advertiser has determined for himself and realized that paying for real customers is much more profitable and more promising (CPA) than paying for users who can see (CPM) or even want to go to his product site (CPC ). <br><br>  In this regard, over the past couple of years, new and new affiliate networks with a pay per action (Affiliate Networks) appear on the Internet at an incredible speed. <br><br>  They are an intermediary service between advertisers and webmasters (publishers), and offer the latter several affiliate programs (offer) for traffic monetization. <br><br>  Now, for each novice publisher, in principle, as well as for the experienced, the questions arise: where to get traffic for monetization?  And how, in fact, to monetize it? <br><br>  <b>Where to get?</b> <br><br>  ‚Ä¢ media traffic (traffic from large media sites, websites) <br>  ‚Ä¢ search traffic (traffic from search queries entered by users on Google, Yandex and other systems) <br>  ‚Ä¢ contextual traffic (traffic purchased in contextual services, as well as placing text blocks on forums, blogs, their own resources, etc.) <br>  ‚Ä¢ teaser traffic (traffic purchased in teaser networks, as well as placing text-graphic blocks on forums, blogs, their own resources, etc.) <br>  ‚Ä¢ social traffic (traffic from social networks, groups and applications) <br>  ‚Ä¢ aggregator sites (traffic from web-sites that accumulate several offers on one or several related topics, for example, a bank aggregator, combines offers on consumer loans, credit cards and mortgages) <br>  ‚Ä¢ sites-services (for example, a dating site) <br>  ‚Ä¢ E-mail traffic (email lists of subscribers to the newsletter from your resource) <br>  ‚Ä¢ stimulating traffic (or Incentivized, Insentive - traffic that motivates a person to action, that is, offers to get benefit only if he does some kind of action on the advertiser's site, for example, ‚ÄúTo get access to view, fill our partner‚Äôs form ‚Äùor‚Äú Download and install the app to win iPad2 ‚Äù, etc.) <br><br>  It is natural to assume that some traffic will be monetized faster and better, i.e.  conversion will be higher (conversion or CTR - click-through rate - the indicator of clickability, the ratio of actions to clicks), and some not.  This is where the concept of traffic quality appears, despite the fact that this concept is almost the most crucial on the way to enrichment. <br><br>  Also, do not forget that a lot depends on what kind of offer you decide to take to monetize your traffic, this also directly affects the CTR. <br><br>  As a result, we get 2 variables that are keys for the successful monetization of your traffic: <br><br>  ‚Ä¢ traffic quality <br>  ‚Ä¢ amount of conversion. <br>  These components can be divided into 4 categories: <br>  ‚Ä¢ high quality traffic <br>  ‚Ä¢ low quality of traffic <br>  ‚Ä¢ high conversion <br>  ‚Ä¢ low conversion. <br><br>  After analyzing these 2 variables with each other on your traffic, you can understand what kind of traffic you own <u>(Fig. 1)</u> and where to go next. <br>  <u>Fig.</u>  <u>1. Determining the value of traffic by 2 components.</u> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/ceb/dab/c0f/cebdabc0f4aab2830bab7f991c413e1d.png"><br><br>  So, now the main task in front of you is to transfer by any means the significance of your traffic to the first square of VKT + VK, namely high quality traffic with high conversion. <br><br>  Here we proceed to the second question. <br><br>  <b>How to do?</b> <br><br>  In order to gradually transfer your traffic from one category to another, you need a lot of time, experimentation and effort.  But everything is possible. <br><br>  For each type of traffic will be their own ways to improve quality and increase conversion. <br><br>  In this article I will start with teaser traffic and share my experiences and numbers.  We will go from the opposite and take the 4th category for the value of our traffic at the initial stage, i.e.  we have low quality traffic with low conversion. <br><br>  <b>Let's start with what is a teaser?</b> <br><br>  <i>Teaser (eng. Teaser "teaser, lure")</i> - an advertising message, built as a riddle, which contains some of the product information, but the product itself is not shown. <br><br>  The teaser is a text-graphic block with a bright picture of the relevant subject of the advertised product and intriguing text, which must motivate the user not only to read the teaser text, but also click on it. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/25d/168/751/25d168751622e0c927b6d1f3fbd5de01.png"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/018/e56/bc9/018e56bc90f9c62a65ba62ec489e7663.png"><br><br>  You can use teaser ads in different ways, for example, place them on your own resources or buy advertising spots in teaser and social networks. <br><br>  By choosing one or several offers in any affiliate network, you should start with the empirical method of trial and error, but still some can be avoided at the first attempts to earn money on teaser traffic. <br><br>  So, create a teaser ad and place it on your traffic, a relatively small amount of time is needed to understand the CTR of your ad. <br><br>  The easiest way to identify the best conversion is to create multiple ads at once.  Then, analyzing the results, it will be possible to disable one or more ads, and at the most advantageous to increase the amount of traffic. <br><br>  It is important to remember that the following parameters have a strong influence on the conversion of ads: <br><br>  ‚Ä¢ title (must contain the urge not only to read the text in the teaser, but also to click on it) <br><br>  <u>Example "as needed":</u> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/8f8/9b1/422/8f89b1422e300e9fb1a4d6b0a2fc5847.png"><br><br>  ‚Ä¢ teaser text (must necessarily reflect the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãthe advertised product, but not completely, but only be a decoy to cause the user interest to go to the advertiser's site) <br><br>  <u>Example "as needed":</u> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/b37/7cb/b2e/b377cbb2e92139b2e4ebe1936e8d8d19.png"><br><br>  ‚Ä¢ picture (it is necessary that the image be bright, eye catching, but at the same time directly or indirectly display the content of the advertised product) <br><br>  <u>Example "as needed":</u> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/355/049/cec/355049cecfbeede358e6ef858b3b85ae.png"><br><br>  Having experimented with different headers, texts, pictures, we will receive our Golden ad, which will bring you your long-awaited high conversion, moving your ad to category 3 ‚Äúsufficiently valuable‚Äù <u>(Fig. 1)</u> , namely low-quality traffic, but with high conversion. <br><br>  It is important to understand why your traffic turned out to be of poor quality, i.e.  Without an assessment of the quality of the actions of perfect users who have switched on your ad, you can not do.  Here you will come to the aid of managers who serve you in partner networks.  In some networks, for example, <a href="http://www.cpanetwork.ru/">CPA Network Russia</a> , they can even provide a detailed report explaining why a particular action turned out to be of poor quality, for example, does not correspond to the necessary geo-targeting, age, sex, etc. <br><br>  Having received and analyzed this information, it will not be difficult to more accurately target your ad and thereby increase the quality of your traffic, but there is a high probability that the conversion will decrease, therefore the value of your traffic will move to category 2 ‚Äúquite valuable‚Äù <u>(Fig. 1)</u> .  Then you should repeat the previous step to find the highest conversion, which ultimately will lead you to the first category ‚Äúvery valuable traffic‚Äù <u>(Fig. 1)</u> . <br><br>  It remains to increase the amount of traffic to get your long-awaited income.  But do not rejoice before the time and think that you have found the "Gold mine", because  Teaser ads can be influenced by various external factors, for example, during holiday periods there will be more conversion ads emphasizing the themes of the celebration (New Year, March 8, Valentine's Day, etc.), it is worth remembering about the seasonality and not to neglect the shares that are provided by advertisers, on which product you pour traffic. <br><br>  Therefore, it is worth adhering to the most important and main rule, which will surely make you gild: experiment! <br><br>  Sigacheva Tatyana <br>  Main Partner Relationship Specialist <br>  <a href="http://www.cpanetwork.ru/">www.cpanetwork.ru</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/148697/">https://habr.com/ru/post/148697/</a></p>
