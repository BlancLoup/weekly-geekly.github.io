This is especially true of the working part of the day.

It all depends on what it goes on.  If mastering new skills, cognitive reading, building relationships or something else that is beneficial, then please spend.  But if this is just a felting, then it is worth thinking about.  Or even better - start with this fight.

      Scientists on this subject have their own considerations.  Through experimentation and research, they have long since found effective and simple ways to combat waste of time and procrastination.  Some of them are really very easy to use, but they give excellent results. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h2>  2 minutes rule </h2><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/mg/ue/zg/mguezgyebbn0wtvhc9uvluecvxe.png"><br><br>  Be sure to take it into service, because it allows you to perform tasks that we tend to postpone until later.  It does not matter for what reasons - for fear of not coping, or simply from laziness. <br><br>  The rule applies is very simple.  If the upcoming task can be completed in 2 minutes, then solve it without delay.  This may be a response to an email, cleaning the laptop from dust, rebooting the system, and so on.  Just do it without referring to the eternal "later." <br><br>  This rule has a sequel.  It lies in the fact that the long-term tasks that cause you bouts of procrastination, too, should begin to perform with 2 minutes.  The essence of all this is that as soon as you start working, you will immediately understand that everything is not so scary and complicated, as it seemed 120 seconds ago.  And even if you have done only a small part of the entire volume of the task, this is already a big step towards its full implementation. <br><br><h2>  Principle of one task </h2><br>  One of the big time eaters is multitasking.  No matter how much they talked about it in theory, but in practice it is ineffective.  And the explanation for this is quite trivial - our brain can concentrate on one thing. <br><br>  London psychiatrists even conducted a study on this topic, and came to shocking conclusions.  Multitasking reduces the level of IQ even more than smoking marijuana. <br><br>  Hence it becomes clear that it is better to focus on the implementation of one task, and to make it as quickly and efficiently as possible.  In this case, it is advisable not to be distracted by other matters, but be sure to take breaks. <br><br><h2>  The secret of microquat </h2><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/ef/tr/ai/eftrailxtu00wjjmm0ryhvisq6y.png"><br><br>  The most difficult, as a rule, is the fulfillment of a voluminous task, for which no deadlines and hot deadlines are set.  The lack of a specific time to complete incredibly relaxes and contributes to the loss of interest in achieving the goal.  In the end, everything is done slowly and without enthusiasm, and the final can never be achieved. <br><br>  To realize some kind of global goal, you need to make a schedule of everyday steps towards it.  It is necessary to regularly perform a small amount of work, which subsequently will give the expected result.  These are the so-called microquotes, which certainly lead to macro gels. <br><br>  This method works fine, for example, in the process of writing a book, when you, without excuse, issue 2 pages per day.  It is also applicable to the creation and development of a popular blog, filling a website or other voluminous project that requires everyday routine work. <br>  Take small steps regularly, and the realization of the goal will not take long. <br><br><h2>  Power of forgiveness </h2><br>  An amazing way to combat procrastination was discovered during a study by American scientists.  They came to the conclusion that if you forgive yourself for wasting time and delaying the deadlines for doing work, in the future this will significantly reduce the craving for doing nothing. <br><br>  Feeling guilty for your own laziness, you will automatically avoid repetition of such emotions, which means you will involuntarily repaint.  Self-blame is not the best companion in life. <br><br>  And if you forgive yourself and forget your past mistakes, this vicious circle will break, and you will be able to take up the next task with great enthusiasm. <br><br><h2>  Fight fears </h2><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/qx/-u/ri/qx-uri5sh4uqdbvufuvgeicbgcq.png"><br><br>  An important point in the struggle for time is the definition of their personal anti-motivators.  Find the reasons why you tend to shirk from doing the job or putting it on the back burner. <br><br>  This may be a feature of character, manifested in excessive impulsiveness, which entails a slight distraction to surrounding things.  Here you need to work on creating the most relaxed and secluded atmosphere. <br><br>  Perhaps you colorize because the task seems boring and uninteresting to you.  Then use the rule of 2 minutes or just do not take such projects to work. <br><br>  Or is it a matter of fear of failing a task?  Then increase self-esteem and be proud of each, even a small victory.  This will contribute to the development of testosterone, which will increase confidence and allow you to take on new projects without doubt and fear. <br><br><h2>  Thoughts of a white monkey </h2><br>  Surely, you have heard about this common mental effect.  The more you will internally tell yourself that you will not procrastinate, the more you will program yourself for this action. <br><br>  You should not think of wasting time as something forbidden.  Better to focus your thoughts on how you complete the project and get rewarded for it.  Think about how to carry out the final touch, and breathe a sigh of satisfaction. <br><br>  Concentrate on what you want, not on what you want to avoid.  Well, use the above techniques to work effectively. <br><br>  Or maybe you have your own secrets to the fight against procrastination?  Be sure to share! </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/457872/">https://habr.com/ru/post/457872/</a></p>
