  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Portal Time is Over, Marketing Time Started</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  It is said that today the key to success for a startup is advanced marketing.  Magical and exhilarating for techies.  As a marketer with good luggage in the Internet industry, I like it a lot.  Finally, the time of "dead" portals, earning a solid jackpot, ends.  The Internet has become a competitive market, and marketers are now held in high esteem. <br><br>  So, you have a team of web programmers in your team, and there is no marketer, but you are very determined.  You are planning to launch a startup, or while you are just thinking about it.  Perhaps you already have a couple of started projects, but the expectations have not yet been met. <br><br>  Quite a lot has already been written about the success secrets of startups.  I hope you studied this literature and you have an idea about elementary rules for developing startups.  Therefore, I propose to talk to us on such a topic as keeping visitors on the site.  Why precisely the retention of visitors, and not their attraction? <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  According to the authoritative consulting company McKinsey, improvements at the stage of customer retention are 3‚Äì10 times more effective than improvements at the stage of attracting them.  Considering any startup, it can be argued that the improvements in retaining visitors are more significant compared to improving the quality of their attraction.

      This is especially important for newly launched startups who need to be very sensitive to the noise of the forest.  It is known that a startup needs to have patience in order to achieve a ‚Äúproduct-market‚Äù match (Marc Andressen).  It is almost unreal to guess in advance the optimal correspondence ‚Äúproduct - market‚Äù.  You will say that there are exceptions.  But do you know what exactly hides behind these examples of exceptions? <br><br>  What makes a product fit the market?  When do you need to change your strategy and switch to another market or change a product?  In the classical theory of marketing to answer these questions you will be offered to analyze feedback from visitors, but this is not as easy as it seems at first glance. <br><br>  What can I offer?  I have a hypothesis that you need to regularly monitor how changes on the site affect visitors retention rates.  After all, a startup must constantly change, be updated.  Without development, he quickly withers.  It is important to analyze not only quantitative, but also qualitative indicators.  And do not forget about the method ‚Äúwith other things being equal‚Äù, having predetermined the base and changing only by one variable. <br><br>  What changes are needed to go to match the "product - market" with minimal losses?  For example, the introduction of new services built at the intersection of market niches.  This is a technological change.  There are conceptual changes, for example, a change in the positioning wording.  Replacing promotional texts with concise variants can be attributed to cosmetic changes, but they are also very important for a comparative analysis of changes. <br><br>  Next, you need to decide on which indicators are good and which are bad, and how does this correlate with the quality of the ‚Äúcoming‚Äù audience?  It is necessary to try all available methods and technologies for analyzing changes.  One of them will suit you. <br><br>  Why is this a hypothesis?  I have experience in marketing development of several startups, and there is a team of three people.  But for launching projects on the network, I lack two web programmers as equal partners.  When I test the hypothesis and select the appropriate method for analyzing changes, you will surely not only be familiar with my startup, but also love it. <br><br>  Article prepared by Daria Galashova <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/users/galashova/" class="user_link">galashova</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/20410/">https://habr.com/ru/post/20410/</a></p>
