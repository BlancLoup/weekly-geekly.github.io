  <section class="page js-page"><h1>A woman‚Äôs brain tumor was an undeveloped twin.</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  A graduate student from India, Yamini Karanam, moved to Indianapolis to study computer science, but at some point it became difficult for her to study.  She ceased to understand simple articles, the words of her friends were confused in her head, and in the end she began to miss work and suffer from headaches.  The cause was found - a tumor in the central part of the brain, which several neurologists and neurosurgeons considered inoperable. <br><blockquote>  Can you put an end to this in one way or another?  God, doctors, anyone.  <i>Wrote Karanam in his blog on March 15.</i> </blockquote>  Only one doctor, Hrayr Shahinyan, practicing radical surgery on the brain through a hole in the patients' skull in Los Angeles, undertook the most complicated operation.  And what he found was not a simple tumor: it was a clot of bones, teeth and hair. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/d4d/f3d/414/d4df3d41497141a736d927d02478d775.jpg" width="600" alt="image"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  This is one of those cases where the main difficulty is not to make a diagnosis, but to search for a person who takes up work - as when a <a href="http://geektimes.ru/post/244404/">man was saved by his wife‚Äôs vision through 3D printing</a> . <br><br>  Financially, Yemini helped her friend, collecting about $ 34,000 using <a href="https://www.giveforward.com/fundraiser/5gb6">the Giveforward platform</a> .

      Shaginyan made a tiny incision in the nape of the girl, went through the endoscope to the inside of the skull and reached the tumor through the natural channel in the brain, where he made an amazing discovery: it was not a tumor at all, but a teratoma, a clot of bone, hair and teeth. <br><br>  Teratomas - undeveloped twins, ingrown into the body of a child.  Sometimes children are born with such clots attached to them, and sometimes adults give birth to them in the style of the film ‚ÄúAliens‚Äù, as was the case with 30-year-old Briton Gavin Height.  Earlier this year, <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/news/speaking-of-science/wp/2015/02/11/newborn-girl-might-have-been-carrying-her-parasitic-twins/">a girl was born</a> in Hong Kong with two partially developed fetuses. <br><br>  Shahinyan successfully carried out the operation.  The surgeon said that this is his second operation to remove teratoma, and with a total score he removed 7-8 brain tumors. <br><br>  In <a href="http://www.nbclosangeles.com/news/local/Embryonic-Twin-Discovered-in-Womans-Brain-During-Surgery-300891281.html">an interview with NBC 4, the</a> girl said that it was her ‚Äúevil twin sister who tortured me for 26 years.‚Äù  Yemini <a href="https://npoht.wordpress.com/">opened a blog</a> where she plans to tell her story. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/366901/">https://habr.com/ru/post/366901/</a></p>
