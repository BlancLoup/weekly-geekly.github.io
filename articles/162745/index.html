    <h4>  Description of the educational process </h4><br>  Each subject is represented by three forms of classes: lectures, exercises and practice.  A distinctive feature - the subjects are taught one by one, that is, the first two weeks - one subject, the next two - the other, etc. <br><br>  Lectures are based on slides and are conducted by professors in the form of presentations. <br><br>  Exercises are conducted by graduate students (people who receive or have received a PhD under the guidance of a professor) and consist of practically oriented tasks and problems.  As a rule, exercises are published in advance, and students have time to prepare.  However, if you are not ready, do not worry, since the degree of participation in the lesson depends on your desire and interest.  Even in the case when none of the students is able to solve the problem, the graduate student provides his own solution and explains how this solution was obtained.  Exercises are required to participate and have a little influence on the assessment on the exam. <br><br>  Practice is a task that is solved by students independently, as a rule, in groups.  To present the results, the group should prepare and conduct a presentation.  As a rule, it is required to explain the principles of the solution, the operability of the solution and provide the source codes (if applicable). <br><br>  Examinations are oral and rather serious, since the volume of material is quite large.  For example, because the first three subjects are related, they are led by the same professor.  He also takes exams.  The volume of material in these three subjects, about 3000 detailed slides, plus additional sources that may be needed to understand some aspects. <br><br>  So, we go to the subjects. <br><br><h4>  Loose-coupled and message-based applications </h4><br>  <b>Objective:</b> to teach the principles of creating loosely-related applications and applications based on the exchange of messages. <br>  <b>Prof:</b> <a href="http://www.iaas.uni-stuttgart.de/institut/mitarbeiter/leymann/indexE.php">Prof.</a>  <a href="http://www.iaas.uni-stuttgart.de/institut/mitarbeiter/leymann/indexE.php">Dr.</a>  <a href="http://www.iaas.uni-stuttgart.de/institut/mitarbeiter/leymann/indexE.php">Frank Leymann</a> <br>  <b>Description:</b> At the core of the subject is the concept of so-called message-oriented middleware and the concept of EAI (Enterprise Application Integration).  Integration of large enterprise applications is one of the main ways of applying the techno nologies described in this course.  Message-oriented middleware is an application stack that provides, for example, message queues and other components for processing and moving messages.  To perform tasks, use JMS and ActiveMQ or a message queue built into the application server.  Basically, all examples are provided for java, as it is the de-facto standard for enterprise-level applications. <br>  <b>The main use case:</b> how to integrate various enterprise applications so that they work together and at the same time can evolve without disrupting the work of other applications.  For example, integration of a CRM system with an inventory system, with a database of employees, given that they can all be provided by different vendors or legacy applications. <br>  <b>Interesting problems and their solutions from the subject:</b> <br><ul><li>  how to receive and deliver data to an application whose source code is not available </li><li>  how to test message based applications </li><li>  Creation of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enterprise_service_bus">ESB (Enterprise Service Bus)</a> , as a bus for access to all functions of the enterprise.

As a rule, he does not do it alone, but invites various people from the industry to make presentations on the topic.  As a result, it turns out a sort of mini-conference.  According to the results of the lecture, you need to write an essay on the chosen topic and prepare a presentation. <br>  <b>Main use case:</b> how companies can reduce costs by transferring their infrastructure to the cloud <br>  <b>Interesting:</b> <br><ul><li>  One of the presentations showed a demo version of the thing, which, according to a diagram describing the architecture of the application, deploys the server for it in the cloud.  It can also determine the architecture of an application that is already in the cloud - something like reverse engineering.  An example of an application that was deployed during the demonstration is SugarCRM.  What struck: the configuration of all servers and packages (yes, no pre-prepared images) occurs automatically.  An OS image is installed, then packages, then an application, then all servers start and you can use it.  It takes everything about everything - a few minutes.
