Running a beta version</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Working with modern web technologies, the ORBIOS Ltd. team.  Could not meet with cloud services.  This is a very promising direction, but whenever using or studying similar products, we could not get rid of the feeling that something was wrong, something was missing. <br><br>  At some point, we decided that it was time to change the world, or at least the approach to cloud technologies on the Internet.  The history of the ORBIOS product began with these ambitious, if not revolutionary, designs. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/a45/b81/741/a45b8174127443ea974b766faadf6b3e.png" alt="image">

    <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  However, before staging a coup, we formulated the main disadvantages of the existing solutions. <br><br>  It turned out that all cloud services are aimed at performing private tasks.  These are web storages or applications, elements of automated control systems that ensure the interaction of objects of distributed infrastructures, etc. <br><br>  These are useful products that have their place in the market.  But, for all their diversity, not one allows completely ‚Äúoff the ground‚Äù, to declare independence from the local device and / or a particular OS. <br><br>  We decided to fill this gap and began to find out from users how they see the perfect cloud. <br><br>  It turned out that no one wants to install, configure and maintain local programs and applications.  The ability to get down to business is very important. <br><br>  We also realized that most users are not interested in learning new complex programs in order to work, play or practice a hobby. <br><br>  Finally, everyone is tired of hanging downloaders and heavy sites. <br><br>  In an effort to take all this into account, we created an integrated ORBIOS platform based on the SaaS model. <br><br>  The SaaS model (‚Äúsoftware as a service‚Äù) completely relieves users of the concerns associated with local software.  It is simply not there (you can install additional applications, but this is not necessary). <br><br>  It is worth noting that the cloud-based solution based on SaaS is an excellent way to build an IT infrastructure for a small business that does not have at its disposal significant financial and human resources for its independent creation and support. <br><br>  The concept of the platform makes it possible to speak of ORBIOS as a single system for solving everyday tasks.  This approach also guarantees the extensibility of ORBIOS.  Even if there are only four applications running so far, we can safely dream of more, plan and implement innovations using or inventing advanced web technologies. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/434/3cc/4c1/4343cc4c10ba4ab1b4f2289960cb2a2c.png" alt="image"><br><br>  The same concept guarantees uniformity in the system.  All interfaces are visually similar, intuitive and interconnected.  Applications will run from the browser window of any device connected to the Internet, regardless of the OS. <br><br>  The power of the data centers, where our servers are located, ensures maximum platform performance even on outdated computers and low-power devices. <br><br><h2>  Already in ORBIOS </h2><br><br><h3>  Files and Folders </h3><br>  Cloud file manager to efficiently manage content in the cloud. <br><br><h3>  Audio Cloud </h3><br>  Collect here a collection of music or audiobooks that will always be with you.  To share it with friends, just create a link to a melody or a whole playlist. <br><br><h3>  Video Cloud </h3><br>  Gigabytes of movies do not contain any local drive, not to mention a flash drive or smartphone.  Now even the heaviest files can be uploaded to the Video Cloud and watch them from there through a functional player that supports all modern video formats. <br><br><h3>  Photo Cloud </h3><br>  Create a collection of beautiful moments in Photo Cloud, caught by all your devices, show it to your friends.  Upload photos without losing quality, use amateur and professional formats. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/6f4/abd/66a/6f4abd66a31d468c8d3a9b028678d946.png" alt="image"><br><br><h2>  ORBIOS protection </h2><br>  Data safety is ensured by regular backup copies on the server. <br>  Account security depends on the complexity of the user password.  In addition, you can use automatic blocking (termination of a session after a certain period of inactivity).  To resume the session, enter the PIN. <br>  When transferring data, an SSL certificate is used.  It is possible to log out of all devices simultaneously. <br><br><h2>  Tariffs ORBIOS </h2><br><ul><li>  Free: 6GB of storage space </li><li>  Economy: 50GB for $ 2.99 per month </li><li>  Standard: 250GB for $ 3.99 per month </li><li>  Business: from 1 to 10TB at a price of $ 8.88 per month </li></ul><br><br>  All existing applications are installed in ORBIOS by default and are available to owners of all types of accounts. <br>  Bonus: all users can get additional disk space through a loyalty program: invite friends to ORBIOS, promote us in social networks, etc. <br><br><h2>  Just in case </h2><br>  For maximum mobility, we offer several additional programs that we are still working on. <br><br><h3>  Synchronizer: travel light </h3><br>  The program allows you to synchronize the contents of the cloud with all the devices on which it is installed.  So the files will always be at hand and will not suffer even in the event of a breakdown or loss of the device. <br>  In addition, the synchronizer allows you to work with files in offline mode. <br><br><h3>  Orbios mobile application </h3><br>  Take Orbios with you - install our apps for iOS and Android. <br>  Convenient: the application provides the function of automatically uploading new photos to the cloud, taken with the device. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/ca7/687/c12/ca7687c1272640ec8aea8624f0a2b3f9.png" alt="image"><br><br><h3>  Orbios plugin for Chrome </h3><br>  The plugin provides download of images found on the Internet to Photo Cloud, works constantly offline, even if the ORBIOS system is closed. <br><br><h2>  Our plans </h2><br>  Today ORBIOS is, above all, a personal space on the Internet, a cloud that is always with you.  However, we are planning to develop services for corporate users. <br><br>  The functionality and infrastructure of the platform will develop, the possibilities of existing applications will expand, new ones will appear.  Soon ORBIOS will acquire its own mail service, instant messaging application, office software package for working with texts, tables, presentations. <br><br><h2>  Connection and support </h2><br>  To connect, it is enough to register on orbios.com.  But do not wait too long: the number of accounts is limited. <br><br>  For all questions related to ORBIOS, you can contact the support service through the website or by phone for free. <br><br><h3>  What we are working on right now (September 3, 2014): </h3><br><ul><li>  We get SSL licenses (Hello to bureaucratic machines. It turned out that it takes a little more time than we expected). </li><li>  We test the system and promptly fix bugs. </li><li>  We finish the messenger and internal sharing of files between users. </li><li>  Soon we will launch a native program for synchronizing files and folders (Windows / Mac / Linux). </li><li>  We finish mobile applications for iOS and Android and the ORBIOS application for tablets. </li><li>  We are working on new applications for ORBIOS, among them: an e-mail client and an office application package. </li><li>  We create environment and API for third-party developers. </li><li>  We place ORBIOS in data centers in Switzerland and the Netherlands. </li></ul><br><br><h3>  Why Orbios? </h3><br><ul><li>  ORBIOS against advertising.  We firmly believe that every Internet user has the right to personal online space, protected from commerce and intrusive advertising. </li><li>  Our company is registered in the UK and accordingly obeys the laws of this country.  The judicial system in the UK is responsible for the protection of personal data of Internet users. </li><li>  We are not affiliated with government organizations.  The list of shareholders of the company does not include and will not include persons in the public service. </li><li>  Habitual environment for users.  In ORBIOS, we have created a convenient and familiar interface by simulating the operating system in the cloud. </li><li>  Development tools.  Soon everyone will be able to independently develop applications for ORBIOS and publish them in the "App Store". </li></ul><br><br><h2>  Welcome to <a href="http://promo.orbios.com/">Orbios</a> testing! </h2><br></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/235405/">https://habr.com/ru/post/235405/</a></p>
