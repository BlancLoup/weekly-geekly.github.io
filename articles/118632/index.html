      Thunderbird is supposed to be the default program instead of Evolution, although Evolution has several advantages: <br><br><ul><li>  Good integration with the working environment (including the message menu, the program menu and the unity launcher) </li><li>  Integrated with existing translation structure </li><li>  Default calendar functions that are also integrated into the environment. </li><li>  Support sync contacts with U1 </li><li>  Sync contacts with GMail </li><li>  The GNOME release process is better than our six-month cycle. </li><li>  Exchange Support </li></ul><br><br>  These are powerful arguments to leave Evolution by default in Ubuntu 11.04, but Thunderbird is gaining momentum - for example, it has already gained the ability to experimentally integrate with Unity (currently important for Thunderbird 3.3 alpha). <br><br>  On the other hand, Thunderbird seems to be more advanced, easier for beginners, has many additions and is good in terms of usability (these arguments are also fixed in the Launchpad). <br><br>  So which one will live?  Thunderbird or Evolution?  I think we will be able to find the answer in a few days through <a href="https://launchpad.net/sprints/uds-o">UDS-O</a> (which will be held in Budapest). <br>  <a href="https://blueprints.launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bspec/desktop-o-default-email-client/">Project</a> <br><br><h4>  D√©j√† Dup default backup utility </h4><br><br>  Many users resented the lack of a standard program for backing up data in Ubuntu.  And, frankly, such a tool makes more sense than, say, a default email client (today, most people use webmail). <br><br>  The specification offers an ‚Äúinvisible‚Äù UI in the system control panel instead of the usual Deja Dup UI.  Another interesting specification involves adding support for Deja Dup in Ubuntu One, when in this way it will be possible to quickly and easily synchronize backups in the cloud from the comfort of the user. <br><br>  Deja Dup seems to be the best candidate, but is there room on the CD for this new application?  We will see. <br>  <a href="https://blueprints.launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bspec/desktop-o-deja-dup-default/">Project</a> |  <a href="https://wiki.ubuntu.com/DesktopTeam/Specs/Oneiric/DejaDup">Specs</a> <br><br><h4>  Unity 2D by default </h4><br><br>  Since <a href="http://www.webupd8.org/2011/01/qt-applications-to-be-evaluated-for.html">Ubuntu 11.10 Oneiric Ocelot will ship with the Qt libraries</a> on the installation CD - it should be easy to add lightweight and low-cost <a href="http://www.webupd8.org/2011/01/2d-unity-to-be-available-as-option-in.html">Unity 2D (Qt) to it</a> . <br>  <a href="https://blueprints.launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bspec/desktop-o-unity2d-qt-cdspace/">Project</a> <br><br><h4>  LightDM instead of GDM </h4><br><br>  LightDM can replace GDM already in Ubuntu version 11.10.  Want a cool login screen?  No problem!  LightDM supports HTML / CSS / Javascript, so making your favorite theme will be easier than ever. <br><br>  Other reasons for the alleged LightDM: <br><ul><li>  It is easier to maintain the code (GDM has more than ~ 50,000 lines in C and uses 36 patches. LightDM contains about 10,000 lines in the same C). </li><li>  A more flexible welcome screen - these screens are very easy to write under X, which means you can have a Ubuntu-specific welcome screen without branching the rest of the code. </li><li>  Speed ‚Äã‚Äãimprovements - the ability to launch the welcome screen without the need for a gnome session </li><li>  The display manager may be common to Kubuntu, Xubuntu, Lubuntu, etc., but still allow each distribution to use its own greeting screen, specific to each distribution. </li></ul><br>  <a href="https://blueprints.launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bspec/desktop-o-lightdm/">Project</a> <br><br><h4>  Default browser </h4><br><br>  Now both Firefox and Chromium have a similar frequency of releases, so Chromium has a chance to become the default browser in Ubuntu.  But does he have what should have such a browser?  This is another question that will be considered at UDS-O in a few days (beginning - May 9). <br>  <a href="https://blueprints.launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bspec/desktop-o-default-browser/">Project</a> <br><br><h4>  Ability to switch to Gnome3 </h4><br>  Due to Unity's high priority in the Ubuntu 11.04 development cycle, the inclusion of GNOME3 in Ubuntu <a href="https://lists.ubuntu.com/archives/ubuntu-desktop/2011-January/002740.html">was postponed</a> until version 11.10, and instead in Ubuntu 11.04 release, Unity was like the environment for GNOME2. <br><br>  Without wasting time, development, as already mentioned, over 11.10 has already been started and GNOME3 packages are already included in Ubuntu 11.10, where you will be able to install GNOME3 directly from the repositories, bypassing the PPA (as it is now in Natty). <br><br>  Moreover, since Unity will work with GNOME3 at 11.10, installing GNOME3 along with GNOME Shell will not conflict with the Unity desktop environment and you will have the opportunity to choose Unity or GNOME Shell in the welcome screen. <br>  As for application indicators, many applications have been patched to enable the use of corresponding indicators in Unity.  But as noted by many Ubuntu 11.04 GNOME3 testers, these patches do not involve working with the GNOME Shell.  All this will change in Oneiric. <br>  The intelligent mechanism will be configured to use indicators only in the Unity environment.  If the current environment is GNOME, the indicators will instantly turn into the usual display method. <br><br>  By the way, the last suggestion about GNOME3 is most likely to be taken as <a href="https://lists.ubuntu.com/archives/ubuntu-desktop/2011-January/002740.html">approved</a> .  But, nevertheless, we will see how it will be in reality. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/118632/">https://habr.com/ru/post/118632/</a></p>
