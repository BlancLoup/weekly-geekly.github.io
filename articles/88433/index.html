And thanks to Alexey Kachayev (kachayev), our meeting acquired international status.  For the sake of this meeting, he came from Kiev to Moscow for just one day. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/414/ced/909/414ced90986ad74a45012ca78b32de49.jpg" alt="image"><br>  Other participants also had to overcome a considerable distance from other cities of Russia. <br>  In total, this meeting was attended by 15 people. <br><img src="http://turometr.s3.amazonaws.com/images/gallery/00/00/02/2010/03/21/36fcd0__0f7197d9ac_600.jpg" alt="image"><br>  Not without curiosities :) The same Alexei could not get to the venue in time, because  He was detained by our valiant militia for some strange suspicion :) But everything was safely resolved, and the official opening of the meeting was marked by the presentation of the Hetman symbol - a mace :) <br><br>  The meeting was held in a very fun and truly friendly atmosphere. <br><br>  I must confess that I couldn‚Äôt remember everyone at once, and the next time the badges with login and avatar wouldn‚Äôt hurt much :) <br><img src="http://turometr.s3.amazonaws.com/images/gallery/00/00/02/2010/03/21/f29173__3c3721ec87_600.jpg" alt="image"><br>  The meeting began with a story about the emergence of the LiveStreet project, which has turned from a simple hobby into one of the most popular social CMS in runet and its possible development prospects.  In the future, the discussion format was by no means official, and various aspects of the project‚Äôs life were touched upon. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/71c/9f1/e5b/71c9f1e5b72c86389ca50a696be5a4c1.jpg" alt="image">

      The most long-awaited and important news was the message that the official release of the stable version 0.4 will take place soon. <br>  Although the <a href="http://livestreet.ru/">LiveStreet.ru</a> site itself is already working on version 0.4 and it is fairly stable, developers want to fine-tune the plugin mechanism so that future versions of them will not have to make changes when switching to new versions of the engine. <br><img src="http://turometr.s3.amazonaws.com/images/gallery/00/00/02/2010/03/21/c6642c__578dbcdd4a_600.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  They discussed the future development of CMS LiveStreet, possible competitors and the own views of the assembled participants on these processes. <br>  It was really interesting, because  Representatives of all LiveStreet community groups were present - engine developers, module and plug-in developers, site owners, and even those who want to launch their own Internet project. <br>  Therefore, everyone had the opportunity to look at LiveStreet in a new way.  Not without controversy - for example, what is better - Mootools or jQuery. <br><br>  It was very interesting to learn firsthand about the soon opening of the international official website of the project.  I even managed to see the layouts of the pages of this site - it looks like it will be a very beautiful and useful resource, on which it will be easy to find the necessary plugins, look at examples of sites and find documentation on the engine, which is very lacking now. <br><br>  The present developers eagerly discussed the nuances of the work and the development of additional functionality.  I liked the openness with which they answered the emerging questions, shared their plans and talked about the difficulties they faced. <br><br>  And although the initial meeting was planned from 14-00 to 18-30, most of the participants lasted until 20 o'clock. <br><br><img src="http://turometr.s3.amazonaws.com/images/gallery/00/00/02/2010/03/21/a3e7f7__3883cb8bb3_600.jpg" alt="image"><br>  It was very cool to meet live with the active members of the community, to find out what kind of people are behind various Internet projects, to find out their development and monetization plans :) <br><br>  I really liked the warm and friendly atmosphere, and I will hope that this was the first but not the last meeting of the members of the LiveStreet community. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/88433/">https://habr.com/ru/post/88433/</a></p>
