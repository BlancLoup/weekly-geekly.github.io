Competently selected specialist saves your money and time, as well as is able to flexibly consider and implement your suggestions and ideas.  However, a freelancer who did not live up to expectations can cause losses to the company, and starting a business will go bankrupt. <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  <b>These unpleasant consequences occur if the freelancer:</b> <br><br><ol><li>  Does not fit into the deadlines </li><li>  Does not comply with the terms of reference of a technical assignment or follows its own understanding </li><li>  Violates schedule and reporting </li><li>  Do not get in touch </li><li>  Does not develop and does not introduce new technologies. </li></ol><br>  In this article I want to identify the main points that you should pay attention to when you first talk to a private specialist.

      1. <b>I can do everything, I will do everything alone in time and at its best in a week!</b>  Freelance is a very competitive market, which means its players will try with all means to get an order.  The problem is that the strength of some "players" is the ability to make unrealizable promises.  So, you believe a person, perhaps you list an advance payment to him and are surprised to find out for yourself that at the time of the deadline, the job is not done, the TK is different from the original one, and the honest freelancer asks you to wait.  It seems to be okay, if you do not take into account that time is one of the most valuable resources and making a deal, you count your resources.  If the specialist claims that he will do the work on time, I recommend signing a contract, which, in case of problems, can be notarized and where penalties will be provided, up to the refund. <br><br>  2. <b>Everybody trusts me.</b>  I work without a contract.  No comments here.  Of course, some freelancers do their job efficiently without a contract.  But who gives a guarantee that everything will be done exactly.  Please remember that the phrase ‚ÄúEveryone trusts me‚Äù or ‚ÄúAsk this or that client‚Äù should immediately discourage the desire to do business with this specialist.  If you ask a freelancer to enter into an agreement, then he must enter into an agreement.  The normal situation is when the specialist himself suggests the customer to conclude an agreement, and he is already entitled to agree or refuse.  Recently, I myself was faced with a situation where the help of a private specialist was required.  By the way, in this area it turned out that it was not at all customary to enter into an agreement and I am still in search. <br><br>  3. <b>I'm doing everything right, I'm a hero!</b>  Immediately worth noting this item.  As I said earlier, freelancing is a competitive business, which means that all specialists are replaceable.  Therefore, if you boast of completion of work on time or compliance with the TK, then something is wrong right there.  In this area, meeting deadlines is the norm, if a person has completed the deadline - this is good, just OK!  A freelancer is not a hero, this is a specialist and if this specialist competently performs his work, you can additionally thank him with a review or a new order. <br><br>  4. <b>Look at my site, there are all the addresses and pictures of my projects.</b>  Any freelancer should have a resume, and the way of submitting a resume should meet the requirements of the customer.  If you ask for a resume for online stores, the specialist must provide a resume for online stores, rather than collect all of their sites from the 1st year of the institute to create volume.  Remember that you respect your time and want to get a result, and if a specialist no longer hears you at the stage of submitting a resume - you can ask the question ‚Äúdoes this specialist need you?‚Äù.  I can assume that a freelancer does not have many target projects, but having said this to the customer and having provided 1-2 projects, he will already show that he can be credible, because he presented the real picture. <br><br>  5. <b>Why do I need a website, I make them for clients?</b>  Famous saying "shoemaker without shoes."  However, here the meaning is much deeper.  If a specialist, especially a web designer or programmer cannot provide the address of his site, it means that he either lacks experience in work or time.  And if a specialist does not have time for self-improvement and training, then he will not be able to perform non-standard tasks, therefore you will receive mediocre work as a result.  I do not want to deceive you and say that I am the perfect freelancer.  I also often do not have enough time for training and self-improvement, or I get so tired of working that I want to move away from the monitor and arrange a day without a PC.  Now I optimize my time to close this gap. <br><br>  6. <b>I graduated from high school, here is my crust.</b>  Often, graduates of specialized universities after graduation seek to earn money.  And it‚Äôs normal that they go into freelancing, especially considering all the features of the alumni interviews for work and the results of the interview data.  The problem is that some graduates overestimate the cost of their services, exposing it as optimal on the market and, of course, instead of a resume prefer to show the crust of the institute.  The problem is that the prices of graduates are often higher than freelancers without special education and reach practically the amounts that companies charge, which in addition to profit take into account expenses for office, staff, taxes, etc.  I want to note that I do not mean all the specialists who have graduated from the university  I am familiar with some who adequately assess their strength, capabilities, and appetites, but, unfortunately, there have been other cases.  It is worth noting that a freelancer who studied independently or from other specialists and learned the right task from his own experience is valued just as much as a specialist who graduated from a university. <br><br>  These items are designed so that you can identify your position as a customer at the first stages of communication with a freelancer and decide whether to start working with him or search for more.  I want to note once again that freelancing is a competitive market and there are more offers than demand, so I recommend paying attention to these 6 points during the first conversation. <br><br>  I wish you find a competent specialist in your field who will increase your income by doing everything qualitatively and on time. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/452882/">https://habr.com/ru/post/452882/</a></p>
