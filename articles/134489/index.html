Anyone who is registered in at least one social network, keeps a blog or microblogging, maybe asked this question to himself.  How on the Web to find those to whom you will be interesting the way you are, and with whom, in turn, it will be interesting to you? <br><br>  I decided to conduct a mini-experiment in which to find out if the Internet is really social for me as a user, is it possible to find people there who are close in spirit, and if so, how much effort will it take. <a name="habracut"></a>

      <b>Social network</b> <br>  In the social network N you can find your classmates or classmates, a former girlfriend or second cousin from Yekaterinburg, and whoever it is unimportant.  The main thing you know them personally.  In the news feed shows the events that occur with my 120 friends.  And since I see them, they see everything that happens to me.  Having stretched my fingers, I leave a long status for friends. ‚ÄúI am looking for people who want to spend an interesting evening discussing the great Woody Allen‚Äôs filmography.  Watching intellectual cinema is a must. ‚Äù  That's all.  What our grandparents spent envelopes and stamps on was done in a minute. <br><br>  <b>Microblogging</b> <br>  I'm doing the same trick.  Unlike the social network, where people come together on the basis of ‚ÄúI know you‚Äù, people get acquainted in the microblogging by broadcasting their reality show.  Liked the tweet - I will follow you, I will not like it - goodbye.  Judging by the number of my followers (101), they like my tweets.  I am writing a tweet about Woody Allen, slightly shortening the number of characters. <br><br>  <b>Blog</b> <br>  I write a longer message to my blog.  He has much fewer subscribers, relatively speaking, two types: people who know me and those who are interested in blog content.  The third double message with Woody Allen shipped quickly.  The confidence that my target audience will appreciate the invitation to culturally enlighten, is strong. <br><br>  Selecting films for the evening, I thought about the fact that in life it is very difficult to find people with common interests.  As a rule, only some things bind us.  I remember that in childhood my mother took me to circles: first dancing, then singing, embroidering ... The dancers with whom I spoke were completely uninterested in singing, and the singers were indifferent to a rag hand-made.  On the Internet, finding people with common interests is supposedly very easy. <br><br>  <b>No happy ending</b> <br>  But!  Among friends in the social network, the initiative to watch intellectual cinema was supported only by one and then - in the future.  I didn‚Äôt receive either retweet or replay to my altruistic offer.  Perhaps because the reality show in the microblog is too fleeting, or because, by and large, everyone deeply does not care about what others are saying.  The main thing is to speak out for yourself.  Activity in the comments under my blog post was not observed. <br><br>  Conclusion.  There are a lot of social services in the Network, where you can communicate and make friends, but all of them have one main drawback - people can communicate not with each other, but as if ‚Äúfor each other‚Äù: everyone speaks only from himself and does not listen to others.  As a result - an informational mess.  And I would like to share only with those people who are interested in it, and vice versa - to receive only the information that is needed / useful / interesting to me.  In part, this is implemented in tags in LiveJournal, but, oh my God, keep me from commenting on the ‚Äúcozy‚Äù zheshochechka and how it is convenient to use. <br><br>  <b>Some analysis</b> <br>  The first attempt to filter information by interest has long been made in services like digg, reddit, stumbleupon.  But they are directed, rather, at collective filtering, and not at communication around interests.  I prefer the trend in modern RuNet (I don‚Äôt know the western ones) - projects like hobius.com, happlink.ru, vinteresah.ru, tactoom.com.  All of them are based on interests, all rather young and raw.  A few words about each. <br><br>  <b>UPD.</b>  Be careful, below - advertising! <br>  <a href="http://vinteresah.ru/">vinteresah.ru</a> .  Difficult and confused.  Some kind of ‚Äúmanagers of interests‚Äù, many functions, blocks, elements, and much more incomprehensible.  The design is quite nice, modern, but overloaded. <br>  <a href="http://happlink.ru/">happlink.ru</a> .  Focus on events and geo-targeting.  Someone, like me, is now hanging out at an Irish pub (or is going to) - let's hang out together.  The user is offered to become a ‚Äúleader of interest‚Äù and ‚Äúget recognition‚Äù.  Someone must like it.  Design in the style of ‚ÄúYandex and Mail.ru‚Äù. <br>  <a href="http://tactoom.com/">tactoom.com</a> .  The main function is to exchange and share in your social circle only what is mutually interesting.  Design - ala updated Twitter and a little Googleplus, but, in my subjective opinion, more comfortable.  In general, I like it, perhaps because of its simplicity and the fact that she has found someone to talk with about Woody Allen. <br>  <a href="http://hobius.com/">hobius.com</a> .  On the one hand, I like to see information on my interests in my feed.  Nothing extra.  The developers call themselves an antisocial network and accordingly build a model.  Maybe an interesting move, but that‚Äôs what pushes me away as a user.  I still want to communicate with people!  Design can be called in one word - hyperminimalism, which many are likely to find attractive. <br><br>  So, the question - whether people who are interesting to each other can find each other on the Internet - remains open.  But the trend is positive.  I want to believe that soon we will be able to be participants in another, better, more useful and interesting communication on the Web. <br><br>  <b>UPD 2.</b> <br><br>  I do not know how to do better than now, but I find services on interests, at least, an attempt.  I hope in the future successful. <br>  For today, problems on the Internet for me as a user are: <br>  a) A lot of information from which I miss a lot of interesting to me. <br>  b) A large number of interesting people, from whom I get a lot of information, often completely unnecessary or uninteresting (in the style of "as I ate tasty" or "it snows"). <br>  c) The presence of a certain mass of people who do not see (and will not see) the necessary information from me, because we do not have chains of communication. <br>  Friends, acquaintances, colleagues (who have now all become retweet-like-repost "bloggers") are united, first of all, by social connections, but not informational ones.  And this, I think, is the main cause of ‚Äúgarbage‚Äù. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/134489/">https://habr.com/ru/post/134489/</a></p>
