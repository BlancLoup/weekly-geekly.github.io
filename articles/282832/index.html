  <section class="page js-page"><h1>LinkedIn opens mega-data center in Singapore</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  The construction and subsequent maintenance of hyper-scale server farms requires huge financial investments.  In addition, in the implementation of such large-scale complexes, you will need to find an alternative that is being designed on your own for standard server and auxiliary equipment. <br><br>  And nevertheless, this essential minus in the implementation of such projects cannot be compared with the subsequent advantages of server farms.  For example, the owners of such data centers have the opportunity to reduce operating costs by using equipment that is tailored to their own needs, without unnecessary energy-consuming components.  By itself, and "iron" can be more economical, purchased from a wholesaler on the most favorable terms.  Thus, it will reduce capital costs. <br><br>  The well-known social network LinkedIn demonstrates the implementation of the mega-data center concept in its own example.

This is the first such a large complex, which is located outside the United States.  A server farm with a total area of ‚Äã‚Äã23,500 feet <sup>2</sup> has already been commissioned.  The cost of construction cost the company $ 58.3 million.  And as necessary, the territory will expand. <br><br>  LinkedIn has about 414 million users worldwide.  And according to official data of the company for the period from 2013 to 2016, the number of users of the social network in the Asia-Pacific region more than doubled, that is, reached 85 million people (including 16 million in Southeast Asia, 34 million in India and 7 million in Australia). <br><br>  The construction of the Singapore data center was carried out using modern technologies using the latest infrastructure.  According to Singapore Power, which is responsible for the transmission and distribution of electricity in the country, the average energy consumption of a single household is 602 kWh per month.  LinkedIn mega-data center constructive solutions will help reduce electricity consumption by an amount equivalent to the demand for electricity from about 100 of these average households. <br><br>  The server farm in Singapore will handle all the Internet traffic in the social network of the region, as well as one third of the global traffic going through LinkedIn servers.  The power of the data center is 4.2 megawatts. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/67a/feb/48d/67afeb48de504a2c9e0328666162bd58.jpg"><br><br>  In the Singapore data center, engineers first installed racks with a height of 52U instead of standard analogues with a height of 48U.  In this way they won extra space by placing four extra servers inside each mounting rack.  The addition of servers in the racks allowed increasing the efficiency of using the potential of switches and other elements of the network infrastructure. <br><br>  Another innovation in the data center has become a three-phase 415 volt power grid.  Analogue of the power grid will soon appear in the new American data center LinkedIn.  It will be located in Oregon and, according to company representatives, will be another big step towards introducing the concept of LinkedIn hyper-scale server farms.  Inside the data center will be placed unique network switches, as well as electrical distribution and mechanical systems created on an individual project.  It is planned to put 96 servers per rack at a power density of just below 18 kW per mounting rack.  With the help of the cooling system design, it will be possible to bring the power density to 32 kW per rack. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/cf3/76a/dc1/cf376adc14b84589b3973ef4c0e03ba5.jpg"><br><br>  As a comparison, the average power density in Facebook data centers is about 5.5 kW per mounting rack.  Engineers began working toward scaling the computing infrastructure without increasing the power density.  Practical experience, research results and tests have shown that a relatively low power density is an excellent option for Facebook data centers. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/282832/">https://habr.com/ru/post/282832/</a></p>
