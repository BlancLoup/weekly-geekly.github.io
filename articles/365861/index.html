I will present my actions with facts and attach correspondence. <br><br>  Many people know that it became known around May that <a href="https://hi-tech.mail.ru/news/sotmarket-selling.html">Sotmarket‚Äôs business was closed</a> , perhaps this was somehow connected with my case.  But this was still far away, because everything started earlier ... <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  <b>03/19/2015</b> <br>  I chose the goods on the site, paid with a bank card the full cost of 1300 rubles. <br>  On the same day, I was informed that the goods were not in stock and I could get paid back money.  To do this, sent to the mail "form for a refund": <br><br><blockquote>  Hello! 
      <br>
        <script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>
        <ins class="adsbygoogle"
          style="display:block; text-align:center;"
          data-ad-layout="in-article"
          data-ad-format="fluid"
          data-ad-client="ca-pub-6974184241884155"
          data-ad-slot="8945601208"></ins>
        <script>
          (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
        </script>
      <br>
      For a refund (1300 rubles), we ask you to fill out (you can electronically, without printing) the form attached below, and send it to us by return e-mail.  Be sure to attach to the letter scan or legible photo ID.  Only significant data is needed: for example, if a passport, then you can even just half a turn, where your full name.  In general, any certificate is appropriate where your full name is. <br><br>  You can leave money in your account to make new purchases in our store.  Your funds will be kept indefinitely until they are requested by you: until a new order is placed with the transfer of money there. <br></blockquote><br><br>  <b>03/26/2015</b> <br>  I wrote a letter to the support service asking when the refund will be made, to which I received the following answer: <br><br><blockquote>  Hello! <br><br>  The form you filled out was accepted on March 22.  Refunds will be held within 10 days. <br></blockquote><br><br>  <b>04/06/2015</b> <br>  The funds have not yet been received, and I again wrote a letter asking when I would receive them, and received the answer: <br><br><blockquote>  Hello! <br><br>  We apologize for the delayed refund.  The relevant department is notified of the importance of this issue, in the near future a refund will be made. <br></blockquote><br><br>  <b>04/23/2015</b> <br>  The funds have not yet been received, and again I sent a letter asking the question, the answer in the same spirit: <br><br><blockquote>  Hello! <br><br>  Thank you for contacting us! <br><br>  The question on the return of money on your order was transferred to the responsible staff.  In the near future the refund will be made. <br></blockquote><br><br>  Then 3 letters were sent asking for a refund: <b>05/21/2015</b> , <b>06/03/2015</b> , <b>06/19/2015</b> .  No response was received for all three letters. <br><br>  Then I decided to approach the issue from the other side. <br><br>  <b>28.06.2015</b> <br>  I wrote a letter to Sberbank because I paid for it with a Sberbank card.  The letter outlined the essence of the problem and asked them to return the money to me, because the seller did not fulfill their obligations. <br><br>  <b>07/17/2015</b> <br>  I received a letter from Sberbank that my application is still being considered: <br><br><blockquote>  Dear Customer! <br><br>  Your appeal is under review.  Due to the need to verify facts that are essential for making a decision on your application, the deadline for providing a reasoned response from the Bank has been extended.  You will be notified of the results of the review. <br></blockquote><br><br>  <b>07/21/2015</b> <br>  A letter has been received from Sberbank stating that as a result of the claim work, funds in the amount of 1,300.00 rubles were credited in full with the credit card account on July 20, 2015: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/2a9/b95/939/2a9b959394b04577826c7fd1e1ef9288.png" alt="image"><br><br>  In the end, I want to tell everyone that it is possible and necessary to fight such bad sellers.  In my case, Sberbank helped, but other banks also have similar reviews of claims and refunds of purchases.  For example, <a href="https://alfabank.ru/claim/">Alfa-Bank</a> . </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/365861/">https://habr.com/ru/post/365861/</a></p>
