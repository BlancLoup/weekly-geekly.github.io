      <strong>=== [ATTENTION] ===</strong> <br>  <strong>Before installing the Miranda-IM PSY pack, save a copy of your old version.</strong> <br><br>  <strong>=== [Miranda IM] ===</strong> <br>  This assembly contains components for communication via the ICQ and Jabber protocols.  Icons were collected from the ones you liked on the official site, as well as kindly provided by Faith Healer. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  <strong>=== [Requirements] ===</strong> <br>  Since most computers are now running Windows XP / 2000 / 2K3 / Vista / Seven, the core of Miranda and the assembled plugins are designed for Unicode-based operating systems, i.e.  not lower than XP / 2000 / 2K3 / Vista / Seven. <br><br>  <strong>=== [Installation] ===</strong> <br>  In version 0.8.x there is an opportunity to manage accounts and a corresponding menu has appeared.  There you can add or remove protocols, as well as configure them later, if you have not configured it to the end when you first start it. <br>  More fine-tuning of the protocols can be done in the corresponding settings menu.  To do this, go to Settings - Network - "Protocol name". <br><br>  <strong>=== [About assembly] ===</strong> <br>  During the heyday of the Russian Internet segment, as well as the rapid development of instant messaging programs, ICQ gained its popularity quickly.  At that time I decided for myself to find the best messaging client.  A test drive was arranged for clients who worked with the ICQ protocol.  What clients at that moment participated in the test, I do not remember.  However, the victory was won, you guessed it, by a client program called Miranda-IM. <br>  Miranda began to use from 2002 with varying success, then, later in 2003, he completely moved to it.  In early 2005, he began to distribute his assembly to friends, after which it appeared at all.  Initially, Miranda I had a conservative classic style, and later I acquired a rather interesting and beautiful interface.  I never wanted to make the assembly more beautiful than someone, I just wanted to fit it for themselves and for their needs.  And since  the tastes and needs of my friends, and not only, coincided, the spread began.  In this assembly, there are also tools for encrypting their conversations through the SecureIM plug-in. <br><br>  <strong>=== [Import your settings and history] ===</strong> <br>  Competent import is our everything. <br>  In order to properly import your contacts and message history, you need to go to the editor of your profile database, then open the CONTACTS menu. <br>  It contains the entire list of your contacts with correspondence stories.  The protocol icon will be displayed on the left, then the name in the contact list (and the protocol name will be indicated in brackets).  If you have multiple protocols used (jabber, icq), then you need to remember them all.  Be careful, REGISTRY OF THE PROTOCOL IS IMPORTANT.  Those.  jabber and Jabber are different protocols in the database. <br>  Next, go to our new profile, to accounts, and create protocol records that we will import.  When adding a new protocol, you will need in the first and last paragraph to register the name of your protocol, taking into account the case, and in the second paragraph, specify the message protocol itself.  Next, fill out the account and proceed to import or add a new protocol. <br>  We launch the message import module, select the item ‚ÄúFrom the Miranda IM database‚Äù, if your profile is not in the list, then click the ‚ÄúOther profile‚Äù button and select the profile from which we will import messages.  You will need to select a menu item that satisfies your needs and click next.  If you have done everything correctly, then your contacts will appear in the contact list, but if the import module has issued that so many contacts are missing, then an error was made somewhere.  It is necessary to re-read and re-do it again to complete enlightenment =). <br><br>  <strong>=== [Plugins and Descriptions] ===</strong> <br>  <strong><a href="http://svp.name/miranda/file.php%3Ffile%3Dversioninfo.txt">Module Information</a></strong> <br>  <strong><a href="http://svp.name/miranda/file.php%3Ffile%3Dreadme.txt">ReadMe File</a></strong> <br><br>  <strong>=== [Appearance] ===</strong> <br>  How Miranda looks like you can see on the screenshots below: <br>  <em>Dialog window with icons.</em> <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/100/2e0/7d9/1002e07d9ad1152207a789072ac499d6.png"><br><br>  <em>View contact sheet.</em> <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/ef6/9e6/ab0/ef69e6ab023c0549298c8d2ac32ad14a.png"><br><br>  <strong>=== [Download] ===</strong> <br>  <strong><a href="http://svp.name/miranda/file.php%3Ffile%3Dmiranda-im_psy.exe">Miranda-IM PSY pack (5.21MB)</a></strong> <br>  Build with user profile with all settings. <br><br>  <strong>=== [Additional Information] ===</strong> <br>  [2009.11.06] <br>  Updated kernel to version 0.8.9 (stable release). <br>  I refused to use the IEView plugin, because  on Windows 7 with Internet Explorer 8 version buggy.  This bug was fixed, but I decided not to return to it. <br>  The contact sheet and message box font has changed a little.  The role of the message log is the plugin History ++, replacing IEView. <br>  Pop-ups are disabled by default. <br>  Tested on Windows 7 / XP.  Update produced through the import of contacts. <br>  Do not forget that the original version of the Internet pager Miranda can always be taken on the <a href="http://miranda-im.org/">official website.</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/74421/">https://habr.com/ru/post/74421/</a></p>
