I'm allergic to altruism.  I think that it is better to deal with an honest bargainer than with a highly spiritual altruist who wants to make all of humanity happy - and these are the most troubles they bring.  You can sell your experience, and you can ‚Äúshare‚Äù with someone.  Ancient Chinese wisdom says: "Do not show your mind if you do not want to be used by you."  It would seem, why share just like that? <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/c39/53d/65d/c3953d65da956784cd3fd123755b2f3d.jpg"><br><br>  When I started blogging on Habr√©, I was looking for content and informational articles in different articles, then pestered engineers, etc.  Then I realized that I need to write myself.  But I'm not an IT specialist at all, but a journalist, and I work in an IT company?  But, as practice has shown, I have something to share.  Then I asked myself: why?  What is the benefit to me if I tell about my work, about my experience?

      That's what I thought of when answering the question of the subject, which gives a ‚Äúsimple sharing‚Äù of thoughts: <br><br><a name="habracut"></a>  1. The release of the head.  Before you have written your experience in writing, you seem to know everything, and so everything is clear, and everything is cooked in your head, and cooked ... and cooked ... As a result, there is no room, no room left for new thoughts.  It will not understand until you write an article.  You really understand that there is more free space in the head, it has somehow become easier to breathe.  After all, your experience, even if it is very good, is still a burden. <br><br>  2. Structuring accumulated experience.  Knowledge must, no, must be conceptual.  What does it mean?  All experience can be reduced to structure - having this structure, you do not need to carry in your head the whole experience of some kind of skill.  Now, instead of a clogged storeroom, your knowledge becomes a toolkit.  And by taking some kind of tool, you take whole tons of accumulated, own, or alien experience - imperceptible to an unsophisticated look.  So, articles or reports on the topic - the very first way to restore order in the closet own experience. <br><br>  3. New Vision.  More precisely, a new vision of nuances that used to be hidden somewhere in the back streets of the brain.  And after writing the article, you see that without this writing, you would never get to these nuances in your life.  After all, the head would have been busy digesting / chewing / wearing experience. <br><br>  4. New vision of the problem.  It is impossible to state ALL moments of a question in any article; a book is needed for this, and it may also not be enough.  But having stated something, you understand that yes, you stated at least just the essence, the very short structure, even though in the form of a short note, but there are still so many side, seemingly unimportant, sides of the problem (enough for the whole book) that you understand again: you are not so smart - you need to look wider at the problem in order to have at least a chance to see something more.  And the further searches begin and, accordingly, the further growth of professionalism. <br><br><h4>  Writing articles help conceptual knowledge </h4><br><br>  Since I consider this item to be very important, I will once again focus on conceptual knowledge, and its difference from knowledge in itself. <br><br>  Conceptual knowledge always consists of a structure, a conscious structure of concepts, when all the faces: logical, associative, experienced merge into one structure with clear boundaries.  It is not a self-sufficient structure, it is not knowledge in itself ‚Äî it is a sterile knowledge, ‚Äúunclouded‚Äù by experience.  This is the knowledge that you can rely on, which you can defend in front of someone.  Such knowledge helps and develops conceptual thinking. <br><br>  If knowledge is not definitely concrete (and not blurry), and experience is always concrete, concepts, then it is rubbish.  When you write an article or read a report, whether you like it or not, you will have to define your experience, express it in new concepts, structures, and ideas.  And this is the most valuable thing in writing articles where you ‚Äúshare‚Äù your experience.  And already after the written article you understand that you didn‚Äôt need to huddle before, to be greedy with your precious experience, and after the written article you see that if it hadn‚Äôt written, the experience would have turned trash and then into garbage. <br><br>  So "write articles, Shura, they are golden ..." <br><br>  Valuable UPD from comments: <br><br>  <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/users/shanker/" class="user_link">shanker</a> writes: <br><br>  My motives for writing articles are somewhat different: <br><br>  1. A professional blog on a thematic resource gives advantages in a professional sense: such a blog shows others what you are worth.  Sometimes in the literal sense: such a blog is a great addition to the resume. <br>  2. One head is good, and 2 is better.  In the comments often give food for thought or new information on the topic of the written article. <br>  3. Acquaintance and networking with new people from the professional industry - never in your life is superfluous <br><br>  <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/users/garg0t/" class="user_link">Garg0t</a> writes: In my opinion, everything is simple.  For you, as a journalist, obviously accustomed to assess the value of information in kinoznaki, but not an IT person, the important nuance of Habr's specifics is not quite obvious: not only the article itself is valuable, but also the discussion in the comments that it has become.  Due to the peculiarities of the community concentrated here, comments can often be no less (and sometimes more) useful and interesting than the article itself.  The author not only shares information, but also receives high-quality feedback, experience is exchanged, the problem is viewed from different angles, and this is beneficial to all participants in the process. <br><br>  Just comment: I do not measure, and never measured the text with kilo-signs. <br><br><hr><br>  Post sponsor: <a href="https://cosmonova.net/">Cosmonova: data centers &amp; telecom &amp; software developer</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/154231/">https://habr.com/ru/post/154231/</a></p>
