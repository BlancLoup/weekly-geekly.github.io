The more interesting and difficult the task, the more experience and knowledge you get in the process.  It is on this task that I work and in this article I would like to share my experience in redesigning and finalizing the Internet payment <a href="http://www.a1pay.ru/">system A1Pay</a> . <br><br>  The article describes the stages of work, the decisions that were made and what they were based on.  Describe in one article all interesting ideas, difficulties encountered and their solutions, findings, etc.  -.  not an easy task.  Some of the important issues, for example, the measured KPIs and their values, for obvious reasons, were completely beyond the scope. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  By the beginning of my work on the interface, A1Pay was already a working system for accepting Internet payments with its strengths: high technological capacities, protection against fraud, support services for partners and subscribers, streamlined work processes, etc.  However, the system is very lacking in friendliness of use. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/e85/fb6/c74/e85fb6c742ba8f4e0838ee9c5eedc6eb.png" alt="The old version of the A1Pay system"><br>  For the management of the company it became obvious that in order for the system and business in the field of Internet payments to grow, a user-oriented product is needed.

      Payment system users can be divided into three large groups: <ul><li>  Vendors / Partners - Website Owners </li><li>  Buyers - users making a purchase on merchant sites </li><li>  Employees of the company </li></ul>  In this article I will tell you more about redesigning the interface for sellers.  We call them partners, because  do a common thing together.  I connected to the project when it was necessary to maintain the current version of the system and at the same time began the development of a new version with advanced features and a new interface.  In my work, I am guided by the approach of UCD ( <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/atermath/user-centered-design-presentation-818344">User-Centered Design</a> or user-oriented design, recently renamed Human-Centered Design).  Following this approach, it is necessary to understand the goals and objectives of users, to involve the user in the development process.  In relation to A1Pay, I defined the following steps: <ol><li>  Study: Examine goals, objectives and user needs when interacting with the system. </li><li>  Audit: Identify and fix existing interface problems.  Create a usability guideline to standardize the UI. </li><li>  Design: Following the results of the first two stages, design the interface for the new version of the system. </li><li>  Testing: Measure KPI after the introduction of the new interface, get feedback from users. </li><li>  Kaizen (continuous improvement): Continuous minor system improvements. </li></ol><br><h1>  Study </h1><br>  In the active phase of the project, research time is very limited.  In this case, long series of in-depth interviews or comparative usability testing are not suitable. <br><br>  You may have heard about <a href="http://www.amazedev.com/uspeshnyj-proekt-orientirovannyj-na-polzovatelya/">the character techniques</a> from Cooper, but I did not use it in this project.  Why - a separate question for a separate discussion.  Instead, I divided users into groups.  The group ‚ÄúSellers / Partners‚Äù, which was mentioned above, I divided into subgroups: <ul><li>  Applicants are those who have just learned about the system and do not yet have an account in it. </li><li>  New partners - sellers who have just registered and started working with the system. </li><li>  Experienced partners - those who have long been working with the system. </li><li>  Former partners - left the system for some reason. </li></ul>  This allowed us to identify scenarios and how the current functionality and content meets the needs of the various user groups and KPIs by which results can be tracked. <br><br><h3>  Web analytics </h3><br>  I used Google Analytics as a web analytics tool.  In it, I tracked the frequency of visits, the navigation chain, the most visited pages, the conversion, etc.  This gave a quantitative idea of ‚Äã‚Äãthe actual use of the system.  In one paragraph of the article it is difficult to talk about the capabilities of this tool for a UX-specialist.  I recommend reading the book by Brian Clifton <a href="http://www.ozon.ru/context/detail/id/4571537/%3Fpartner%3Damaze">‚ÄúGoogle Analytics.</a>  <a href="http://www.ozon.ru/context/detail/id/4571537/%3Fpartner%3Damaze">Professional analysis of attendance of websites "</a> and the book Avinash Koshyk. <br><br><h3>  Support tickets </h3><br>  There is no better way to develop <a href="http://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%25AD%25D0%25BC%25D0%25BF%25D0%25B0%25D1%2582%25D0%25B8%25D1%258F">empathy</a> (empathy for another) and to feel the real pain of users than to answer the ticket support service for some time.  At Zappos.com (which is famous for its corporate culture and customer-oriented approach) every employee, be it a developer, marketer, or project manager on a trial period, responds part of the time to requests for support.  Questions and suggestions of current users of your system, while understanding the reasons and filtering, are an inexhaustible source of ideas for improving interaction.  If the difficulty or the same question arises for several users, then this is a sure sign - in a particular place of the system there are difficulties.  The task of the interface designer is to fix the problem, propose a solution, bring it up for discussion with the team (user advocate) and decide together how this should be implemented and achieve implementation or inclusion in the development plan. <br><br><h3>  Forum, social networks and blogs </h3><br>  As already mentioned, communication is important for creating an impressive UX.  A1Pay is represented in all popular social networks and services: <a href="http://twitter.com/">Twitter</a> , <a href="http://vkontakte.ru/club16981103">Vkontakte</a> , <a href="http://www.facebook.com/pages/A1Pay/119652338084203">Facebook</a> and LiveJournal.  The account in each of them is got for dialogue.  In them, the company's specialists answer user questions, are ready to listen to suggestions and comments.  In addition, blogs and forums are constantly monitored, all messages are promptly processed.  Unlike technical support in his own blog, a person is impartial and free in self-expression, so sometimes there are also emotional reviews.  It should be understood that the user has all the reasons for outrage.  The problem he faced is always the most important for him.  He is your ally because  he doesn't care.  He wants the system to be better and more convenient.  Of particular interest is <a href="http://brokenbrake.biz/2010/11/24/ugly-A1Pay">constructive criticism</a> .  The reaction of the designer according to these messages, as well as on support tickets: fixing the problem, analyzing, discussing, correcting or adding to the development plan.  In addition to external channels, there is a forum on the site where partners ask, offer, discuss, help each other, etc. <br><br><h3>  Questioning </h3><br>  Based on the data and familiarity with the system, I formulated a hypothesis about the main use cases of the system: registration - setting and testing - monitoring - withdrawing funds.  In each of these scenarios there is interaction that can be improved.  I decided to clarify the details and support the hypothesis by questioning.  Among the sample of partners we distributed a questionnaire with the following questions: <ol><li>  What information in the A1Pay system (indicators, reports, etc.) do you check and consider as the most important? </li><li>  How often do you check it? </li><li>  Do you have enough information you get?  Are there any indicators that you have to count yourself? </li><li>  Do you have any difficulties with the A1Pay system?  Please tell us more about it. </li></ol>  The questionnaire consisted of open questions, which made it possible to obtain qualitative information. <br><br><h1>  Audit </h1><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/8f3/c7b/38f/8f3c7b38fefeea82fbda5a20e016a250.png" alt="A1Pay's usability guideline"><br><br>  It turned out that there are no general requirements for UI and the interface was created by the developer of a specific module at each site of the system.  As a rule, this approach creates two big problems: When everyone is responsible for his part, no one is responsible for the interaction as a whole.  Another problem is interface inconsistency.  The same operations in different parts of the system could be done in different ways.  The larger the system, the more tangible the impact of these problems.  The solution was the standardization of the interface in <a href="http://www.amazedev.com/usability_guidelines/">usability-guide</a> . <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/f19/6fb/3c1/f196fb3c1abe3c13f9748dcf0c3d7cf5.png" alt="A1Pay's usability guideline"><br><br>  About how guidelines can improve the quality of web projects, I wrote in detail in the article <a href="http://www.amazedev.com/usability_guidelines_article/">"Using usability guidelines to improve the quality of web development</a> . <a href="http://www.amazedev.com/usability_guidelines_article/">"</a>  I will show some interface problems and their solutions. <br><br><h3>  Confirmation of operation </h3><br>  Important operations, when the data could not be restored (for example, deletion), were not confirmed.  The following rule was formulated: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/bdb/45c/079/bdb45c079ab5815e4aa829b0040e2c0b.png" alt="Confirmation of operation"><br><br>  For delete operations or other non-return operations, a message is displayed for confirmation.  In the text, the name of the object on which the action is performed must be reported. <br><br><h3>  Context help system </h3><br>  Judging by the calls to the technical support service, the meaning of some terms, principles of the system operation or conditions caused questions. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/269/353/888/269353888c23de264d4bc36620f6eb2f.png" alt="Context help system"><br><br>  It was proposed to place the context help icon on the right side of the template, which leads to the description of the current screen (service, operation, etc.) in the knowledge base.  Help opens in a new window. <br><br>  Standardization of the UI is expected to require improvements in the system and the creation of new functionality. <br><br><h1>  Prototype </h1><br>  At the moment there are a large number of <a href="http://www.amazedev.com/prototipirovanie-web-proektov-sobiraya-voedino/">prototyping tools</a> .  Everyone can <a href="http://www.usability.by/category/tools/">find a tool</a> convenient for themselves and the tasks that they face.  However, the point is not in the tool, but in what you create in it and what you want to work through.  In this project, the task was to create an interactive, highly detailed prototype, so I used <a href="http://www.axure.com/">Axure</a> . <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/90b/5e8/898/90b5e889859f0bcc627901dba68ee09c.png" alt="Axure"><br><br>  The creation of a detailed prototype was preceded by a conceptual design.  At this stage, information architecture, navigation, interaction architecture, etc. were worked out.  It seems to me that before using any of the tools you need to ‚Äúthink‚Äù on paper.  She can handle everything. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/405/5cd/84a/4055cd84a93e3487a2e6ac46358ebd45.png" alt="Prototype on flip chart"><br><br>  At the conceptual design stage, navigation was a matter for me.  To make it horizontal with tabs and submenus or vertical, as in the old version?  Having drawn both versions on paper (vertical in the image) and comparing it with the development plans of the system, I decided to focus on the horizontal version.  The logic of my decision is as follows: <ul><li>  When new modules and solutions appear in the system, the menu is not cluttered. </li><li>  Due to the vacated area on the left, the working area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe screen has increased. </li><li>  At any given time, the user works with one screen.  There is no scenario in which the user would need fast navigation throughout the system. </li><li>  Even if such a need (quick navigation) arises, then it can be implemented through contextual links-operations. </li></ul>  Navigation elements were ordered based on visit statistics and research data.  The most frequency operations and modules are located above and to the left. <br><br>  Another important point of conceptual design was the appearance of the previously missing ‚Äúdashboard‚Äù (dashboard) as the main screen.  The main and frequency scenario of working with the system is monitoring.  Dashboards must unequivocally show the state of the system, changes and their cause.  In places where this is due to the context, give quick links to detailed information deep into the system (for example, detailed statistics, etc.).  So, on paper, dashboards were drawn with the main blocks: income graph, balance, accounts, news, new tickets, etc.  Some elements of the modules were pulled out to the panel in order to increase the speed (give ‚Äúquick links‚Äù). <br><br>  About designing a dashboard You can read Stephen Fiue <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0596100167%3Fie%3DUTF8%26amp%3Btag%3Denhancingorga-20%26amp%3BlinkCode%3Das2%26amp%3Bcamp%3D1789%26amp%3Bcreative%3D390957%26amp%3BcreativeASIN%3D0596100167">‚Äôs</a> excellent <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0596100167%3Fie%3DUTF8%26amp%3Btag%3Denhancingorga-20%26amp%3BlinkCode%3Das2%26amp%3Bcamp%3D1789%26amp%3Bcreative%3D390957%26amp%3BcreativeASIN%3D0596100167">Information Dashboard: Design by The Effective Visual Communication of Data</a> , <a href="http://www.usability.by/design-dashboard/">see</a> Aaron Harsman‚Äôs <a href="http://www.usability.by/design-dashboard/">presentation</a> or examples on the <a href="http://www.enterprise-dashboard.com/">Dashboard Spy</a> website. <br><br>  After conceptual design, detailed drawing of all screens of the system in the Axure program began.  A total of about 30 screens were designed.  The interactive prototype allowed us to demonstrate and discuss the planned UI with the team. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/9a1/d64/280/9a1d64280c26df8c3aea0f03a4937fe0.png" alt="Storyboard"><br><br><h1>  Design </h1><br>  After the protection and approval of the prototype, clarification of the requirements of the manual for graphic design, we moved on to drawing the design.  The designer should actively work together with the graphic designer, explaining the mechanics of work and the possible states of some interface elements.  When working with a remote designer, you must provide the prototype with additional comments.  For these purposes, I used the capabilities of the program for taking screenshots of FastStone Capture.  On Habrahabr, there are often articles about web-hosting web services that allow the team to discuss design in a civilized way and store the results in the cloud.  Such services because of Lebedev sometimes called linkchelkami. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/cfc/4fc/a76/cfc4fca7673fd05f352d57cf18d4f445.png" alt="Design Comments"><br><br>  Graphic design is difficult to formalize.  It is unlikely to get the desired result the first time.  After several iterations, revision-revision managed to come closer to an acceptable option.  The number of iterations depends on the skill of the graphic designer and on your ability to see the final result. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/4d4/da8/bd0/4d4da8bd0497cf48943f8854ea325377.png" alt="Design"><br><br>  At this stage, the designer has also drawn a logo. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/abb/305/163/abb30516342a705cebbe95fb4b2432d6.png" alt="Logo"><br><br><h1>  Verification of the decision and further actions </h1><br><br>  After some time after launch, I still see places that should be improved or improved.  If you read the book <a href="http://uibook2.usethics.ru/">User Interface Design2.</a>  <a href="http://uibook2.usethics.ru/">The art of washing an elephant ‚Äùby</a> Vlad Golovach, you know that this is typical of interface designers and this is part of professional development. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/3c4/aa7/eae/3c4aa7eae7fa6e7592aadb0b2a528ad4.png" alt="Dasha helps to grow KPI"><br><br>  The system has specific KPIs that are tracked online.  (displayed on a large TV).  After redesign, the number of calls to the support service for working with the system has decreased, the total number of partners has grown, loyalty has increased, etc. <br><br>  Refinement and improvement of the interaction are carried out in each sprint (working on SCRUM). <br><br><h1>  findings </h1><br>  Usability and user experience is an important, integral part of the client-oriented service.  I know very few examples (services or products), where without specially selected specialists they achieved significant long-term results (unless it is 37 signals, where the UX is raised to a flag).  On the other hand, the slogan "UX is king" remains in the articles of Western usability gurus.  In reality, user experience and usability services the business.  Often, a UX specialist has to run into technical, legal, and political constraints.  Somewhere to seek a compromise, somewhere to push the solution in the originally proposed form, and sometimes, on the contrary, to abandon it entirely - the reality of interface design. <br><br>  The work of a UX specialist within a web service or product is possible using the UCD methodology with many iterations. <br><br>  In this case, I showed from which parts the work on the web interface of the Internet payment <a href="http://www.a1pay.ru/">system A1Pay consisted</a> .  You can use my experience in part or in whole.  Plans to tell about the redesign of the promo site and payment window.  Ready to answer your questions. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/123859/">https://habr.com/ru/post/123859/</a></p>
