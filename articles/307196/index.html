And I thought he was a normal man ... ‚Äù‚Äú Anya, how much to tell you: the words ‚Äúcreative‚Äù, ‚Äúsound producer‚Äù just like ‚Äúpediatrician‚Äù or ‚Äúhomeopath‚Äù have no relation to human sexual orientation! ‚ÄùJoke, between however, it was not born out of nowhere - the word ‚Äúcreative‚Äù in the last few years has acquired a somewhat negative, mocking color.  And in vain - because creativity as the ability to create non-standard ways to find, generate cool ideas is inherent in everything: scientists, programmers, sysadmins, designers, and merchants.  Moreover, creative thinking can and should be developed to be ahead of other professionals, after all, both product consumers and top managers of companies value a non-standard approach.  especially if it gives a profit.  IKRA in this business is already 7 years old, and we have something to say and where to invite. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/736/4f9/e27/7364f9e2743a4cc9ad5e673cfa59620e.jpg"><br><br><a name="habracut"></a>

      <strong>let's get acquainted</strong> <br><br>  IKRA is a school of creative thinking.  We teach to apply and integrate creative methodologies in various areas: advertising, video, producing, event, information technology, finance, publishing and more. <br><br>  IKRA programs are based on the inductive approach.  We are sure that only in this way can one gain experience and knowledge that are beneficial.  How does it work?  First, you make a mistake, after - you go on your own to find a solution to the problem, and only then you get an answer and instructions for action.  In other words, we pave the way for you to new skills and professions through mistakes and experiments. <br><br>  For 7 years we have released about 2,000 graduates, most of whom work in advertising companies and agencies.  We have trained about 3000 employees of the largest Russian companies in creative thinking and continue to introduce creative thinking in various professional fields. <br><br>  <strong>For whom CAVIAR?</strong> <br><br>  IKRA for all those who are looking for non-standard ways to solve professional problems.  For professionals in the field of creative, digital, advertising, communications, IT, education and other fields.  These are not trainings of personal growth, not vague desires for the formation of creativity, but a real school, with an important theory, an enormous amount of cases and practice.  In fact, this is the information that I received, took, left and the next day introduced it into my daily work. <br><br>  We know at least 8 motives that guide people from IT and related industries, coming to ICRU. <br><br><ol><li>  Developers, programmers and designers learn to perceive projects holistically, as a single creative process of their team. <br><br></li><li>  The Timlides and managers learn to conduct bright sales presentations, to submit a project from profitable and commercially attractive parties.  After all, it is not enough to have a brilliant code - it needs to be brilliantly sold. <br><br></li><li>  Technical writers and PR people come to pump copywriting skills.  Let's open a secret, sometimes people come from IT management for the same. <br><br></li><li>  Everyone learns to communicate competently. <br><br></li><li>  HR-service learns how to work with applicants in a creative, competent and correct way. <br><br></li><li>  Programmers come to us, who understand that programming is not really theirs, and learn copywriting, strategies, delve into the mechanism of creativity and become strong managers in digital projects, because they know the product not only from the outside, but they also understand the most subtle nuances from the inside. <br><br></li><li>  Marketing specialists, PR specialists and other employees of commercial services go through workshops on branding and contact with the target audience - this helps them to integrate their product into the consumer value system, sell effectively and bring in money to the company. <br><br></li><li>  CAVIAR is also a networking: you will not believe how useful dating can be made in the friendly and intelligent atmosphere of CERA. <br></li></ol><br><br>  <strong>We invite you to visit.</strong>  <strong>On a visit, it means a gift</strong> <br><br>  From August 14 to August 19, our school (Moscow, ul. Baumanskaya 11, p. 8) of creative thinking IKRA will open the doors and will not close them for 6 whole days!
