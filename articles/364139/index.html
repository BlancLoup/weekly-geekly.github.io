  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Experience familiarity with the Chinese Galaxy Note III</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Good day, readers of Geektimes!  My work involves travel to the Northwestern Federal District, and sometimes further.  And my main communication tool is a smartphone with WhatsApp and Viber installed.  I do not consider myself a picky person with respect to technology, the main thing is if it only works.  And my Alcatel Pop C5 completely suited me until recently, until I began to slow down with a large number of received messages in Viber.  And I wondered about the idea to get myself some other device, at the same time to increase the screen diagonal. <br><br>  <i>Caution traffic: photos and screenshots</i> <br><a name="habracut"></a>  As I wrote above, I am not demanding of technology and, especially, of the brand.  I went to all the famous bulletin board to see what offers are now, and I saw several different ads for selling Chinese copies of Samsung and Apple smartphones.  Why not?  Besides, overpaying for the logo on the phone is not for me. <br><br>  I called the phone number listed in the ad, and, having learned the address, went to this store.  The store is nothing outstanding, what are the tens.  On the shelves are the iPhone, iPod and other joy for apple lovers: both originals and copies that interested me.  For a start, I asked for a copy of the iPhone 5S - the copy was on Android.  Then why not Samsung?  The choice fell on the Galaxy Note III.  Large screen, good viewing angles, good speed.  On the look and feel - not to distinguish from the original.  Grade - the most minimal:

I used the day calmly and well: GPS, maps (with a compass!), Communication ‚Äî everything I use works great.  I entered into the account of the phone 100 rubles and was pleased.  But, suddenly: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/c30/5b7/d76/c305b7d7624743baa04c65b5b85c4d4c.png"><br>  <i>"I am plagued by vague doubts ..."</i> <br><br>  And the truth is, what is this service number?  Entering the number in Google did not give anything, but I was wary.  And it is not for nothing that you are wary!  Just a few hours after depositing funds into the account, the following message came: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/c17/0a8/3ab/c170a83abd724f40965e5ce113b0dbcb.png"><br>  <i>In fact, between the messages, it was not 20 minutes, but about 5 hours.</i>  <i>I can not know why this time is shown in messages</i> <br><br>  Is it a virus?  ‚ÄúEh, your stupid head, you forgot about the antivirus!‚Äù I said to myself and decided to install Dr.Web.  On another phone I have it, so why change habits?  In addition, I have no complaints about the work of Dr.Web. <br><br>  After installing the anti-virus application, a full scan was immediately enabled. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/bd0/83c/17a/bd083c17a2cc4a7c94b4a2cdc40b6cfe.png"><br>  <i>Strange beast in my smartphone</i> <br><br>  Well, OperaService is an embedded application.  Delete his antivirus could not, for that it was possible to disable.  At the same time, as in the best traditions of witch-hunting, I turned off all the built-in applications in which Opera was somehow mentioned.  Including the browser itself.  So that was discouraged. <br><br>  My mood immediately rose and some kind of enthusiasm appeared.  ‚ÄúWhy not check something else out?‚Äù I thought and decided to install Avast.  The result was less clear, I found <b>Android: Agent-FSG [Trj]</b> in the playPush app: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/ee4/8d3/b88/ee48d3b88bbe4544aee379c43b71ee8f.png"><br>  <i>Short and not clear</i> <br><br>  Well, since I try anti-viruses, then the next turn after another domestic development.  By the way, Kaspersky pleased me least of all: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/96b/713/54b/96b71354bd764a9588709bfd291f8165.png"><br>  <i>Found something, something in quarantine, but what exactly?</i> <br><br>  He didn‚Äôt say and didn‚Äôt show what he found and where, just put something into quarantine.  But what and where?  Well, suppose I just did not find the desired menu, or at least the event log.  I admit, did not go deep. <br><br>  Well, perhaps the most interesting is NOD32.  He pleased most of all: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/289/bef/ccb/289befccb99248f8b31b01ce1fd5cf5e.png"><br>  <i>Immediately two hares!</i> <br><br>  It turns out that there were two beasts: one downloaded the programs for his own pleasure (and probably ate traffic), and the second was engaged in sending paid SMS.  The strangest thing is that Avast and Dr.Web found the Downloader, but did not notice the SMS sender.  What exactly found Kaspersky for me remains a mystery. <br><br>  The smartphone was reset to factory settings, packed in a box with documents and returned to the seller the next day.  The seller turned out to be understanding and, seeing such a menagerie, did not argue and just returned the money.  This is where my acquaintance with Chinese copies ended.  Apparently, you have to pay extra for the brand.  In branded phones, I hope this bjaka is not found. <br><br>  <i>PS At the expense of the "jumping" time in the screenshots: photos of SMS messages and Nod32 skinshots were taken already before I went to the store.</i>  <i>The rest - in the order as written.</i> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/364139/">https://habr.com/ru/post/364139/</a></p>
