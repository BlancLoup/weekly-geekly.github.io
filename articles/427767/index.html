    <h2>  What is the essence of tax </h2><br>  In the 90s, people often wrote music in "blanks".  Therefore, many countries ( <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%259F%25D1%2580%25D0%25B0%25D0%25B2%25D0%25BE_%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B0_%25D0%25B2%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B7%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B0%25D0%25B3%25D1%2580%25D0%25B0%25D0%25B6%25D0%25B4%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B5_%25D0%25B7%25D0%25B0_%25D1%2581%25D0%25B2%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B1%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B4%25D0%25BD%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B5_%25D0%25B2%25D0%25BE%25D1%2581%25D0%25BF%25D1%2580%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B7%25D0%25B2%25D0%25B5%25D0%25B4%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B5_%25D1%2584%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BD%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B3%25D1%2580%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BC%25D0%25BC_%25D0%25B8_%25D0%25B0%25D1%2583%25D0%25B4%25D0%25B8%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B2%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B7%25D1%2583%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BB%25D1%258C%25D0%25BD%25D1%258B%25D1%2585_%25D0%25BF%25D1%2580%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B7%25D0%25B2%25D0%25B5%25D0%25B4%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B9_%25D0%25B2_%25D0%25BB%25D0%25B8%25D1%2587%25D0%25BD%25D1%258B%25D1%2585_%25D1%2586%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BB%25D1%258F%25D1%2585">including Russia</a> , Japan, Germany, etc.) have begun to charge an additional fee from the cost of blank CDs and sound recording and sound reproducing gadgets (phones, radio, computers). <br><br>  In Canada, <a href="https://torrentfreak.com/canadian-music-group-proposes-copyright-tax-on-internet-use-181006/">this practice does not apply</a> .  And now the authors of music in the country have begun to declare that they are losing large sums because of this.  To remedy the situation, representatives of the SCGS offered to take money elsewhere - to introduce a streaming tax.  But its implementation is rather unusual. <br><br>  Here it is necessary to clarify that SCG represents the interests of people who write music for TV shows and television shows.  And in the Guild, they <a href="https://torrentfreak.com/images/ScreenComposersGuildOfCanada-e.pdf">calculated</a> that the royalties paid by streaming services like YouTube, Netflix or Amazon are 50‚Äì95% less than the amount paid on TV and radio. <br><br><blockquote>  They want to compensate for this financial gap by imposing a tax for each Internet user in the country, spending more than 15 GB of traffic per month.  SCGC believes that this amount of traffic is enough for regular surfing, checking email and making purchases online.  In their opinion, if this threshold is exceeded, then the user either watches the video online, or listens to music. </blockquote><br>  It is assumed that the money collected in this way will help offset the lost profits to the authors of the soundtracks.  At the end of September, SCGC representatives launched <a href="http://screencomposers.ca/scgc-advocates-for-composers-at-canadian-copyright-review-hearing/">their initiative</a> in the Canadian House of Commons.  The further fate of the project depends on the decision of the parliamentarians.  On its basis, the Canadian Heritage Department will issue the final verdict. <br><br><h2>  Criticism of the initiative </h2><br>  In general, the Guild initiative in the community was met negatively.  The proposal was criticized by representatives of the nonprofit organization <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenMedia.ca">OpenMedia</a> , as well as independent lawyer and editor <a href="http://www.michaelgeist.ca/about/">of copyright books</a> Michael Geist (Michael Geist).  They note the following disadvantages: <br><br>  <b>The initiative is too "one-sided."</b>  The fact is that the threshold of 15 GB was chosen based on the personal experience of one of the SCGC members.  He <a href="http://www.michaelgeist.ca/2018/09/canadian-music-group-calls-for-copyright-tax-on-broadband-data-use/">stated</a> that his family does not spend more than this norm, if it does not watch movies and does not listen to music.  However, a problem arises here - for example, gamers will fall under the ‚Äúdistribution‚Äù. <br><br>  According to the September data, Canadian gamers <a href="https://www.newswire.ca/news-releases/paypal-2018-global-gaming-insights-canadian-gamers-spend-52-hours-gaming-online-every-month-and-more-than-half-of-them-are-women-694103601.html">spend</a> 52 hours each month playing games over the network - the traffic at the same time significantly exceeds 15 GB.  A similar picture will happen with single player games.  For example, the upcoming Fallout 76 is expected to take up 50 gigabytes of disk space ‚Äî downloading similar amounts of data is three times the threshold set by SCGC.  It turns out that gamers of Canada will pay tax just like that. <br><br>  <b>Subscribers of streaming services will pay twice.</b>  Users of Netflix, Spotify and other streaming services already pay for their monthly subscription.  If they impose a tax, they will pay both content sites and authors from SCGC. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/ki/i2/0a/kii20atfmmakmte_xvtzumigebq.jpeg"><br>  <font color="#A9A9A9"><i>Photo <a href="https://pxhere.com/en/photo/722530">PxHere</a> / PD</i></font> <br><br>  Executive Director of OpenMedia Laura Tribe (Laura Tribe) <a href="https://globalnews.ca/news/4538209/composers-guild-canada-tax-download/">agrees</a> that the composers do not receive enough money for their work because of the streaming giants.  But she is convinced that this problem must be solved differently.  In OpenMedia, they <a href="https://globalnews.ca/news/4538209/composers-guild-canada-tax-download/">proposed to</a> shift user taxes to streaming services or introduce additional state funding for composers. <br><br><h2>  Similar cases </h2><br>  Digital copyright laws are not limited to Canada.  A month ago, the European Union <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/9/12/17849868/eu-internet-copyright-reform-article-11-13-approved">approved the</a> reform, which was dubbed the ‚Äú <a href="https://globalnews.ca/news/4446228/meme-killer-copyright-eu-article-13/">killer of memes</a> ‚Äù.  Now platforms like YouTube and Facebook are required to implement special content filters and monitor copyright compliance on the site. <br><br>  And in early October, the President of the United States <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/matthewleimkuehler/2018/10/11/president-trump-signs-music-modernization-act-introducing-landmark-copyright-reform/">approved a</a> <a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/115th-congress/house-bill/1551/">bill</a> on musical copyright - the Music Modernization Act.  In America, a new regulatory body will be created.  His task is to ensure that right holders receive fair amounts of streaming their songs on Spotify, Apple Music and Amazon.  Previously, the content sites themselves were responsible for this. <br><br>  With the help of the new law in the USA they hope to protect the rights of composers and performers and create a market with healthy competition and fair pay.  We will tell more about this law in one of the following materials in our blog. <br><br><hr><br>  <i>PS More about the world of audio in our <a href="https://t.me/audiomaniaRU/">Telegram channel</a> :</i> <i><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/xq/5o/_r/xq5o_rmc8w8juvbckkxdgn5adaw.png"></i>  <i><a href="https://t.me/audiomaniaRU/641">What is music?</a></i> <i><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/xq/5o/_r/xq5o_rmc8w8juvbckkxdgn5adaw.png"></i>  <i><a href="https://t.me/audiomaniaRU/640">Our headphone rating</a></i> <i><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/xq/5o/_r/xq5o_rmc8w8juvbckkxdgn5adaw.png"></i>  <i><a href="https://t.me/audiomaniaRU/642">Is pop music becoming less meaningful?</a></i> <i><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/xq/5o/_r/xq5o_rmc8w8juvbckkxdgn5adaw.png"></i>  <i><a href="https://t.me/audiomaniaRU/639">Beginner's Guide: What is important to know about headphone ear cushions</a></i> <i><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/xq/5o/_r/xq5o_rmc8w8juvbckkxdgn5adaw.png"></i>  <i><a href="https://t.me/audiomaniaRU/632">How to start choosing home acoustics?</a></i> <br><br><hr></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/427767/">https://habr.com/ru/post/427767/</a></p>
