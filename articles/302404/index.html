      Every business must be adapted for mobile devices.  <b>About 79% of websites that exist today are adapted for mobile devices, and smartphones are the most common device around the world.</b> <br><br>  Before wondering how much a mobile version of the site is needed for your business, imagine the picture when a potential client will have access to your resource 24/7, right in your pocket or at arm's length.  Is not that great?  Today, the ability to find information about a brand in a few clicks is much more than ever in history.  And all this information can be at hand with your potential customers. <br><br><h4>  Mobile Options </h4><br>  Today, the process of creating a mobile version of a site for a smartphone or tablet is available more than ever in history, especially if your programmer or web designer uses a WordPress template that can be easily adjusted and tailored to the required specifics.  This will save your budget when developing a mobile version of the site - you will save time on design, navigation and branding. <br><br><h4>  Mobile version of the site - the first step to profit from mobile </h4><br>  Start with a mobile website, and you will be able to gradually discover all the new mobile marketing opportunities for attracting customers.  You can increase revenue by creating mobile apps, mobile landing pages, simple text marketing or mobile platforms. <br><br>  Another important addition to your mobile strategy is to attract customers, strengthen brand loyalty and create a positive brand reputation in general - landing pages and mobile apps. <br><br><h4>  Mobile site and mobile application.  Advantages and disadvantages </h4><br>  The development of mobile sites requires less work than creating mobile applications, which, in turn, can reduce the overall cost of promotion. <br><br>  This is partly due to the advent of adaptive design that allows you to adjust the site under the screen of the device on which it opens.  In fact - two formats in one.  As for applications, they should be saved and written for a variety of mobile platforms - Android, IOS, Windows Phone, Blackberry, which is much more problematic and time consuming. <br><br>  Another advantage of a mobile site over applications is simpler traffic attraction.  Attracting people to your website will be much easier than motivating them to download the application on a mobile device.  On the one hand, you can promote a mobile site using the same SEO tools as a regular site.  And even if you convince users to download the application, it‚Äôs far from a fact that they will use it constantly and make a stable contribution to monetization. <br><br><h4>  Want to have a business at hand, on the touch screen?  Give preference to the application </h4><br>  If your site is not fully adapted for viewing on the screen of a mobile device, the presence of the company's application will allow you to avoid redesign from scratch.  The question is how to find the necessary audience that will be ready to download your application. <br><br>  And the various constraints that exist for sites, in particular - restrictions on the use of sources and limited space, again, add points to the use of mobile applications.  In addition, many statistics confirm the information that users spend much more time in applications, and not on mobile versions of sites.  For example, <b>back in 2013, users spent an average of 30 hours per month in mobile applications</b> .  This is understandable, because smartphones on which these same applications are installed are almost always at hand with potential customers.  Why not look at them "in between", on the way to work or home? <br><br>  Many are afraid of only one thought about updating the site.  It threatens to expend such resources as time, money and nerves.  After Google decided to lower in the results of issuing sites that do not have a mobile version, business owners no longer have a choice but to ‚Äúobey‚Äù today's trends. <br><br>  Landing is the best way to announce the upcoming events of your company, create time-limited marketing campaigns via mobile, create ‚Äúselling‚Äù pages.  And the most valuable thing is that you do not need to rewrite your main site and do the boring and hard work of the IT department.  You simply create an additional resource, which, in turn, helps to attract additional traffic to the main site.  To date, in the abundance of existing tools, you will not have difficulty creating landing pages. <br><br>  So, in our article, we gave some comparative characteristics of the mobile version of the site and the mobile application.  Which option to choose is up to you.  Of course, <b>you need to take into account the specifics of the business in which you are involved, the user behavior and the budget that allows for the company.</b>  <b>You can start small, gradually developing multi-channel and increasing, thereby, the flow of potential customers.</b> <br><br>  But the main thing that should not be forgotten: the <b>development of the mobile is inevitable.</b>  <b>These are the realities of today and not taking them into account means losing.</b> <br><br> <a href="http://www.byyd.me/ru/register/%3Futm_source%3Dmegamozg%26utm_medium%3Dpost%26utm_campaign%3Dcontent_marketing"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/041/3c5/29a/0413c529a1424210a02b160e54a40e80.png"></a> <br><br>  <a href="http://www.byyd.me/ru/%3Futm_source%3Dhabrahabr01062016"><b>BYYD ‚Ä¢ Mobile Advertising Platform</b></a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/302404/">https://habr.com/ru/post/302404/</a></p>
