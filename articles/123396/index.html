      Whose fault is that for so long I did not write anything about the Czech Republic ?!  Of course, first of all I myself.  Namely, exactly six months after the <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/it_abroad/57693/">post about obtaining a residence permit in the Czech Republic,</a> I returned to my homeland in Russia, where I spent a year and a half.  I came back to Prague just two weeks ago, although I went to the Czech Republic a couple of times to visit.  By the way, now that post is of little relevance, a lot has changed in two years and so far I have not fully understood that I will write a separate post, as I will find out all the nuances. <br><br>  Just the difficulties of immigration and my ‚Äúrose-colored glasses‚Äù played a cruel joke with me and I was forced to return and leave the Czech Republic.  For the beautiful and carefree life in Prague, I did not notice how my affairs crumble in Russia and how my family relations deteriorate due to the fact that I spent very little time on them, began to save on everything that surrounded me and above all on myself the very  As a result, we rushed back to rescue what was still there, save ourselves and the family as well. <br><br>  Now I have come to Prague with a completely different attitude towards life, towards the Czech Republic and towards the reality surrounding me, and this is probably the most honest post about the Czech Republic, such as I see it to myself. <br><br><img src="http://www.everyculture.com/multi/images/gema_01_img0069.jpg"><br><br>  So, in order ... <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br><h1>  What ways it is worth moving, what internet services to use to search for an apartment! </h1><br>  In fact, everything is quite simple, the options are either by car or buy a compartment on the train and scatter all the things there.  I did so and arrived by train.  The road per day is not at all tedious, if there is a five-year-old daughter, a pregnant wife, an iPad and a MacBook with movies nearby. <br><br>  Rent an apartment in Prague can be on the spot, it does not take more than a week.  In the meantime, you can start to stay at the hotel or if friends have the opportunity.  You can rent an apartment for a short period - this is an apartment that is rented for short periods, most often for tourists.  In search of an apartment, it is best to use the service <a href="http://www.bezrealitky.cz/">www.bezrealitky.cz</a> .  In this case there is a chance to find an apartment without the services of a realtor, but I did not manage to quickly find a suitable apartment and I used the website <a href="http://www.sreality.cz/">www.sreality.cz</a> , where there are much more offers.  As a result, I rented a three-room apartment in the area where many of my acquaintances and friends live - Stodulky. <br><br>  In general, one-room or two-room apartment can be rented for $ 500-700 per month.  Suppose not in the center, but Prague is not as big as Moscow and you can reach the center from the ‚ÄúPrague ass‚Äù itself a maximum of 20-25 minutes. If your soul calls on tiled roofs, then add another 30% to this cost.  Although I have several friends who live in the center and pay significantly less than those who live on the outskirts, but this is an exception to the rule of course.  And I personally do not like the center, tiled roofs include constant noise from cars and exhaust gases, there are few places for walking with a child and the lack of large stores or you need to get there by transport.  But I did not live in the center, so I don‚Äôt have anything to compare with of course. <br><br>  As soon as you are on the spot and get a registration, you need to urgently register at the new address in the police.  If you plan to drive a car in the Czech Republic, you need to exchange your Czech rights, but I think this is necessary only when you receive a residence permit after the first annual visa. <br><br><h1>  What a beer to drink IT </h1><br>  This time I decided to stop drinking everything that burns or almost burns, but from memory I can say that the Czechs themselves drink exceptionally light beers.  They regard the dark with disgust, considering it to be women's (women‚Äôs) beer, although most of our compatriots love the Black Goat, whom it is not so easy to find in Prague.  Of the institutions I advise the beer pub Kozlovna in the vicinity of the metro Andel.  I think on the site you will be prompted by any Czech.  On Andel_e generally a lot of institutions with adequate prices for beer and food.  There is also a Staropramen brewery with the eponymous restaurant and the freshest beer.  In general, an IT person is better not to drink, but to work more.  :) In fact, you need to drink a beer that you like and do not pay attention to anyone's advice! <br><br><h1>  Who is IT pros to be friends with </h1><br>  Here the tips are very subjective and I don‚Äôt presume to bring you the ultimate truth.  Therefore, I write purely personal feelings.  Friends with the Czechs are not glued to their compatriots.  I can not explain exactly why it happened, it seems to me the difference in mentalities.  Czechs are generally friends with each other in a slightly different way; family values ‚Äã‚Äãare more important for them than friendship.  Therefore, the Russian-speaking diaspora is quite strong here.  There are some interest clubs, ranging from pregnant women and young mothers - <a href="http://www.mamaguru.cz/">www.mamaguru.cz</a> , ending with the Pragmatics club <a href="http://www.pragmatiki.org/">www.pragmatiki.org</a> .  There is also a Czech get-together at Lepra, which I like the most, those who find it in the tank at <a href="http://cz.leprosorium.ru/">cz.leprosorium.ru</a> .  I hope that programmers and designers will be able to find friends right there on Habr√© and I suggest in this thread to exchange contacts to all those who are already here with us!  :) <br><br><h1>  About girls for IT professionals </h1><br>  With girls.  Especially for IT specialists in the Czech Republic is somewhat ambiguous.  On the one hand there are a lot of tourists, students and immigrants from other countries, but most often they are not for long here.  On the other hand, to me personally, they did not surrender for nothing with their beautiful wife!  :) However, the Czechs themselves are not the most beautiful sight.  If a Czech girl is less or less pretty, then there is little chance of her being free, because there is practically no choice of Czech men.  Therefore, if you come to search for your destiny in the Czech Republic, you will have to find it difficult or immediately seek for an English-speaking destiny, the chances are many times greater.  If you saw on the street a beautiful girl in a short skirt and high-heeled shoes, then she is either Russian, or a fashion model, or a prostitute, not given anything else!  Therefore, look for fate on the spot and bring it with you.  Because there are no female programmers or designers, and you can‚Äôt even find cute ones with a fire in the afternoon! <br><br><h1>  My rose-colored glasses, the Internet, mobile communications and medicine </h1><br>  The obvious disadvantage of immigration is that you are depriving yourself of all that is usual. <br><br>  It‚Äôs usual to pay for a mobile phone 200 - 300 rubles without refusing anything, here you will pay for all the same 40-50 euro minimum. <br>  It is convenient not to pay for the Internet and you just turn it off.  In the Czech Republic, you do not turn off anything.  If you do not pay, sue and expose a fine five times the amount of your debt.  Still there is a very cool scheme.  For example, the local provider UPC.cz provides you with a connection to the Internet, along with this service, it gives you some kind of use of your super-modem, and if you disconnected, you did not send them a modem by mail, which they may not receive yet, then after several months of non-payment, you are sued and a fine is again issued.  Moreover, they sell debts to completely different companies, which, as it were, are not related to the provider.  The same with insurance on the car, I forgot to pay for the insurance, the car is in the garage, do not care, the car must be insured and you are already a debtor and your debt is also sold to a debt recovery company, which immediately takes him to court.  The scheme is tested perfectly!  This all refers to any kind of activity where you get services, starting from rentals and ending with mobile operators.  Therefore, the habit in Russia of not paying for an apartment for half a year disappears very quickly, and this is his mother's unusual!  All these expenses are of course compensated for by generally inexpensive life in the Czech Republic.  The same products, according to my observations, are cheaper by a third, or even twice, than in Russia. <br><br>  Separately I would like to touch on the topic of prices for mobile and Internet.  In the Czech Republic, you can buy a SIM card at any supermarket without a passport.  It is worth buying a card from Vodafone, it costs 200 CZK - 350 rubles (approximately).  The cost of calls on the Vodafone network is 3 kroons a minute (5 rubles), for all other phones twice as much.  And it is very expensive compared to Russia.  Internet 3g on this card will cost CZK 500, though honest 3g, and not like ours.  You can also connect postpaid options on the contract, everything is cheaper there, but you have to pay for packages of services and it would be beneficial to pay at least 1000 EEK per month and this is the cheapest offer on the market.  Internet costs adequately 100 megabits - 500 - 700 crowns per month, 10 megabits - 200 - 300 crowns per month. <br><br>  Very unusual situation with medical services.  You need to have insurance for which you really pay.  Czechs are covered by employers, and we are immigrants.  The cost of insurance is from your salary.  The minimum wage is 6,000 kroons, and 13.5% insurance against this amount, which is approximately 40 euros per month.  Moreover, to extend a visa you cannot receive a minimum salary, and your expenses are calculated from the number of people in the family and the apartment, which is necessary for these people, and if there are 4 people in your family, the family income should be at least 1,000 euros, which means insurance for you and your wife will already cost 80 euros per month.  In this case, you will not insure the child with you, you will have to buy insurance for the whole period of obtaining a visa for two years at a time and it costs you 50 euros per month.  Multiply by 24 months and get the amount of 1200 euros at a time.  And if the child is two?  Moreover, if the disease is chronic and you brought it with you to the Czech Republic, then the insurance will not pay for the treatment until you receive permanent residence after 5 years in the country.  The blessing of prices for standard medical services is equivalent to Moscow polyclinics.  But if something serious, it becomes not at all familiar!  True, I know families living here with children with diabetics, as they do, I do not really understand.  In addition, to get to the doctor you need to register for it, and the record can easily be scheduled two weeks in advance.  Therefore, to cure a bad tooth for insurance quickly will not work. <br><br>  It is not at all customary to prove every two years that you are not a ‚Äúgoose‚Äù.  Going to the police, collecting reports on the company, some papers, accountants, numbers and a lot of money to extend the residence permit and once going through this thorny path, throwing it is very, very sorry. <br><br>  Well, the main problem is communication and language.  Not everyone is easy with this, and if you need to deal with some nuances of complex linguistic, it can be very difficult and you have to constantly face this, which is the most unusual of all immigration. <br><br>  There are still a lot of problems, from lack of communication with relatives and friends to working moments, for example, I used to work in the office.  And it will have to be decided, otherwise life in the Czech Republic is not as rosy as it may seem from the outside.  The only thing that pleases is the fact that solving problems hardens the character and pumps out fatty deposits from buttocks that are used to immobility.  ;) <br><br><h1>  IT industry in the Czech Republic </h1><br>  In order not to deviate from the subject of Habr, I decided to write a paragraph about websites and services on the Internet that will be useful to you directly for living in the Czech Republic.  Today in the Czech Republic is a real boom for all kinds of startups.  This is especially true of coupon services.  The most famous of them is <a href="http://www.slevomat.cz/">www.slevomat.cz</a> , and this is the first candidate for the purchase of Grouppon_.  There are discounts on everything from children's goods and services to sports goods.  There is a large service aggregator of similar sites <a href="http://www.kamproslevy.cz/">www.kamproslevy.cz</a> .  And judging by the number of such services, Russian startups have a lot to take examples from. <br><br>  I also use the wonderful project <a href="http://www.mapy.cz/">www.mapy.cz</a> , this is a map service, oddly not based on a google map, but on some of my own, which includes almost all search options for anything.  Starting from tourist routes and transport routes to doctors and real estate.  By transport in Prague, you can check the clock!  It runs exactly on schedule, which means the Czechs have made a separate website, where anyone can calculate the route and find out what transport, how much time and for what money he gets to the required place.  You can do this at idos.cz - a simple and convenient site.  I really like the local counterparts price.ru and the yandex market, and heureka.cz in my opinion even surpasses the domestic counterparts in the literal sense of convenience.  As well as the Seznamovsky service Zbozy.cz, which contains the largest database of online stores in the Czech Republic. <br><br>  There are a lot of startups and sites, it makes no sense to describe them all.  If you are interested in a specific topic, I will try to answer in the comments. <br><br>  Finding a job in the it-industry in the Czech Republic and getting a working, rather than a business visa is now quite difficult, unfortunately.  You must either be very valuable or just be a valuable and cheap employee.  Therefore, only business visa is suitable for migration. <br><br><h1>  IT Outcome </h1><br>  As I wrote above, this time I prepared more seriously.  In my agency in Russia, 22 people are already working against 8 in the last race.  I found a partner director for managing major projects in Russia and now I do not remotely manage business processes myself.  Here in the Czech Republic I thought up an occupation for myself in advance and now I begin to implement my idea almost on arrival, having allocated a budget for it in advance.  And if something goes wrong, I will sit on the train with a calm heart and come back without hysterics and tears, I made this promise to myself first of all.  Only with such thoughts, I think it is worth moving from one country to another and then maybe something will come of it. <br><br>  In general, I like the Czech Republic and I would like to stay here to live, work and raise children.  And I hope that I will succeed.  But if it does not work out, then at any moment I can return to where everything has already turned out, it‚Äôs a pity that the environment and the political system cannot be changed there, but with this, in principle, you can put up with desire. <br><br><h1>  ITPS </h1><br>  I will not promise to write about something next time.  Ask questions and I will think about what to write in the next post about the Czech Republic. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/123396/">https://habr.com/ru/post/123396/</a></p>
