But in reality, this is not always the case: the audio system can be placed on the ceiling or entirely hidden in special niches in the wall.  Let's talk about built-in acoustics, how it is designed and where such systems are used. <br><br> <a href="https://habr.com/company/audiomania/blog/431344/"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/bu/ml/3a/buml3amiqrap8zgbqem-wahmiam.jpeg"></a> <a name="habracut"></a><br>  <font color="#A9A9A9"><i>In the photo: a <a href="https://www.audiomania.ru/content/art-6034.html">large cinema in the office of "Audiomania"</a></i></font> <br><br><h2>  Prehistory </h2><br>  The direction of flat speakers in the speaker industry began to develop in the 1990s.  In 1996, <a href="http://history.sandiego.edu/gen/recording/loudspeaker.html">a</a> ‚Äúspeaker with the principle of distributed functioning‚Äù was <a href="http://history.sandiego.edu/gen/recording/loudspeaker.html">developed</a> , aka DML (Distributed Mode Loudspeaker).  And already in 1997, the first mini-audio system using this technology went on sale, it was made by Benwin.

      The product was called Benwin BW2000 and was a set of computer speakers.  The company's engineers saw the potential in DML equipment: they <a href="https://www.anandtech.com/show/312">planned to</a> use the technology in car audio systems.  However, Benwin froze the project. <br><br>  Flat speakers attracted the attention of other market players, including the creators of sound-reproducing equipment for the home.  In 2006, Sonance <a href="http://www.sonance.com/company/milestones">unveiled</a> one of the first ‚Äúinvisible‚Äù Architectural Series acoustic systems.  Columns could be embedded in the walls or ceiling - the audio system became completely invisible in the interior. <br><br><h2>  How it works </h2><br>  In flat speakers, the sound source is a broadband radiator, or exciter.  In it, unlike a dynamic loudspeaker, there is no conical diffuser, and the voice coil is connected to a solid panel without openings.  On it, the coil <a href="https://www.techwillsaveus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/HowAnExciterWorks.pdf">transmits</a> vibrations that spread over the entire area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe panel. <br><br>  The surface, in turn, works like a soundboard of a musical instrument and amplifies the sound waves from the coil.  In order to transmit oscillations of the radiator, the material of the surface of the column must be rigid, but rather flexible.  Therefore, the panels are made of plywood, aluminum or plastic. <br><br>  When the column is installed in the wall or on the ceiling, the panel is painted in tone (or in the case of walls, they are hidden behind wallpaper).  On average, the thickness of the coating above the device should not exceed 2‚Äì3 mm, otherwise the sound of the system will be disturbed. <br><br><h2>  Spheres of application </h2><br>  Invisible audio systems are installed both at home and in public places.  In the living room flat speakers can be mounted anywhere: in the bedroom, living room, in the kitchen.  Built-in acoustics are placed even in bathrooms and saunas.  For example, models of the Stealth Acoustic LRg series <a href="http://www.stealthacoustics.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Bathrooms-Spas-and-Saunas.pdf">can withstand</a> temperatures up to +60 ¬∞ C and high humidity.  All metal elements of the column are behind the panel, so the device does not deteriorate. <br><br>  Also built-in speakers are used as a sound source in home theaters.  Suitable acoustics for this application are <a href="https://www.audiomania.ru/content/art-3903.html">produced</a> by Ceratec, called Cerasonar.  This series includes speakers for rooms of different sizes - from 25 to 100 square meters.  m, - as well as a full subwoofer.  The design of the devices assumes the presence of from one to four sound emitters, their thickness is 10 cm in the subwoofer and 5 cm in the other speakers. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/bn/1h/7l/bn1h7lve_6plllwqa4q3sw6pv7i.jpeg"><br>  <font color="#A9A9A9"><i>In the photo: a <a href="https://www.audiomania.ru/content/art-6034.html">small cinema in the office of "Audiomania"</a> with Cerasonar speaker system</i></font> <br><br>  Video on how to install speakers Cerasonar: <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/FCxlThkNmXM" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br>  Flat columns are also installed in public places, such as cafes and museums.  In restaurants, built-in acoustics are usually placed on the ceiling.  According <a href="https://www.feonic.com/case-studies/applications/FeonicCaseStudyFoxysRestaurant.pdf">to the</a> owners of institutions, flat speakers "scatter" the sound of the room.  In the restaurant, as a result, there are no separate noisy places near the speakers, and all the guests calmly communicate with each other without the need to shout out music. <br><br>  In exhibition spaces, built-in acoustics are used to create sound installations or are made part of a work of art.  So, the British artist Adriana Pace (Adriana Paice) installed the speaker in the canvas, which was embroidered with silk line from the poem.  When visitors to the gallery touched the picture, they activated motion sensors, and the column <a href="https://vimeo.com/23469069">began to</a> reproduce the audio recording of this work. <br><br>  And not always flat speakers are hidden in the interior: the <b>audio system can be a full-fledged decor item</b> .  Such devices are manufactured by Fr√§sch.  Fella columns are <a href="https://www.interiordesign.net/articles/15383-fraesch-brings-audio-to-acoustic-wall-tiles/">hidden</a> in bright felt tiles, which are 60% made from recycled plastic.  The system is controlled by Bluetooth. <br><br>  A similar audio system was created in Bang and Olufsen.  The BeoSound Shape set <a href="https://www.audiomania.ru/content/art-5002.html">consists</a> of hexagonal tiles of various sizes.  The complex consists of actually flat speakers with a textile coating (under it - a plastic surface), amplifiers and dampers. <br><br>  Built-in acoustics are used in street audio systems.  For example, speakers from Feonic are placed under the floor of the terrace or hidden behind pots of plants.  The devices are protected from moisture and snow and operate at a temperature of -20 ... +100 ¬∞ C. <br><br><h2>  Advantages and disadvantages </h2><br>  With the help of built-in acoustics, you can create a full-fledged audio system that does not take up much space.  The interior of the room does not need to adjust under the column, and according to your desire all the equipment will be removed from sight.  And in terms of sound quality, ‚Äúinvisible‚Äù systems are comparable to ordinary, ‚Äúvoluminous‚Äù speakers. <br><br>  The main disadvantage of embedded acoustics is the cost of creating such a system.  Although the price of the equipment itself does not exceed the cost of floor speakers, the installation of an ‚Äúinvisible‚Äù audio system in the house <a href="https://www.cedia.org/blog/choosing-speakers-freestanding-vs-in-wall">will cost</a> much and take a lot of time. <br><br>  A separate minus is at the ceiling speakers.  Their sound will seem strange and unnatural to someone.  This happens because the ears of a person are not accustomed to perceive the sound coming from above.  Therefore, the speaker system on the ceiling is not suitable for everyone. <br><br><hr><br>  <i>About acoustic systems in microformat - in our Telegram-channel:</i> <i><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/xq/5o/_r/xq5o_rmc8w8juvbckkxdgn5adaw.png"></i>  <i><a href="https://t.me/audiomaniaRU/647">Our buyer's guide: shelf vs floor speakers</a></i> <i><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/xq/5o/_r/xq5o_rmc8w8juvbckkxdgn5adaw.png"></i>  <i><a href="https://t.me/audiomaniaRU/632">How to start choosing home acoustics</a></i> <i><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/xq/5o/_r/xq5o_rmc8w8juvbckkxdgn5adaw.png"></i>  <i><a href="https://t.me/audiomaniaRU/630">How to make listening to the audio system more comfortable</a></i> <br><br><hr></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/431344/">https://habr.com/ru/post/431344/</a></p>
