  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Ways of self-development of the student. Practice 2 - Learn to write</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  We continue our practical training.  We <a href="http://andrebrov.blogspot.com/2009/09/1.html">have already</a> reviewed a set of tools that could be useful to us, and today there will be more practice - today we will learn to write.  Oddly enough, the ability to write is the skill that we are no longer taught at the university, but which is still taught in school.  Yes, students are often given the task of writing a paper or making a report, but in the end, at 95 percent, it all comes down to searching the Internet for ready-made material.  And after graduating from school and coming to work, the former student may already be face to face with the fact that he does not know how to write various documents.  The ability to write is also important because each sentence is a complete thought, so in the letter we first learn to think clearly.  So let's get started. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  I want to make a reservation right away, everything described below is like my work, and the compilation of numerous articles and translations, and applies not only to the writing of the already mentioned essays and reports, but also entries in diaries, blogs, and so on. <br><br>  <b>The main idea</b> .  Probably, this point is the most important - we must clearly and coherently, preferably in one sentence, formulate what we will write about.  This will help both in the search for the material necessary for publication and in the dropout of superfluous, when everything is already written, and all that remains is to bring the records into the proper form. <br><br>  <b>Make a plan</b> .  When the idea is clearly formulated, you can move on to the plan.  The plan should contain the key steps in building your publication.  In addition, often the article fails to write in one sitting and have to come back to it once, second and third.  Therefore, the presence of a plan, as well as possible comments and notes to it, will help to harmoniously develop the text. In addition, the plan does not allow to move away from the main idea and constantly maintain reflections and narration in one direction.

      <b>The structure of the text</b> .  Under the structure of the text, I understand the presence of the introduction, disclosure of the topic, conclusion and everything else that makes the publication more logical.  Here, in principle, it is easiest to use ready-made structures, especially when writing resumes, business letters and other similar texts, since their structure has been verified literally for centuries, and knowledge of such structures is the rule of good taste. <br><br>  <b>Slang, idioms and stable expressions</b> .  Each publication has a target audience, whether it is a report at a lesson or an annual financial report.  And this audience is used to using certain turns of speech, words and expressions.  Therefore, writing a text, it is important to read it again, perhaps some expressions, phrases, or even individual words will have to be replaced so that the text does not sound wrong.  For example, it would not be too vernacular, it would not contain too many terminology, expressions from adjacent areas.  The same can be attributed to repetitions, they also need to be avoided. <br><br>  <b>Paragraph breakdown</b> .  Each paragraph of the text contains a certain block of information, so break your article into paragraphs.  And here our plan can be useful to us.  First, you can break into line with the points of the plan.  Then each of the resulting paragraphs break based on logic and completeness.  For example, a paragraph may be formed around a keyword or phrase. <br><br>  <b>The volume and complexity of the text</b> .  Often, the university is obliged to write essays severely limiting one of the boundaries of the volume, for example, no more than 15 sheets.  On the one hand, this is true, as it will allow you to remain concise, which is a very important feature when writing articles.  On the other hand, if the lower limit is set, then it may be necessary to fill the work with meaningless data, which obviously spoils its perception.  And the imposition of the complexity of the topic that requires opening, following the specified volumes becomes more than a complex task, so there is always a thin line to be found here. <br><br>  <b>Spelling and punctuation</b> .  Two scourge of modern man.  Constantly using instant messengers, reading forums and sending text messages, we cease to monitor how well we write.  Therefore, before the final publication, check the spelling, for example, using MS WORD. <br><br>  <b>General readability of the text</b> .  Many people read by simply looking through the text and isolating individual words and phrases from it.  This is a feature of our head.  And this must be taken into account when you write something.  Make formatting mandatory, uniform, at least it looks beautiful.  Highlight chapters and subparagraphs to form the structure of the text.  Do not abuse pictures, graphs and tables, since switching to them, you can forget what the text is talking about. <br><br>  And most importantly: write, write and write again!  After all, if you do nothing, then nothing happens. <br><br>  Here is a short list of key rules that should be followed when writing any texts.  At the end, I also want to add - read, read more, as this is the best way to learn how to write correctly. <br>  And the next practice, we learn to speak.  Thanks for attention. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/71251/">https://habr.com/ru/post/71251/</a></p>
