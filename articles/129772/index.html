  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Independent upgrade of Macbook pro (mid 2010)</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/5e9/93a/e3c/5e993ae3c3d15f187da803f0801e09f8.png" alt="Macbook pro" align="right">  It happened to me that I knocked my MacBook from two meters high directly on the asphalt edge, and exactly by the side with which the hard drive is located - of course, for <i>reasons I do not understand, the</i> laptop began to slow down terribly.  Initially, I did not attach much importance to this, since it was the first Mac in my life, and I did not know how they should work in reality.  ‚ÄúWell, it slows down, and that, I also have a problem,‚Äù I thought until I saw how MacBook works for my friend.  And he has a white plastic of the past generation, and I have a praised i7 with 4 gigs of RAM.  Then it came to the giraffe, then something is wrong here and it would be necessary to take his pet to the service center. <br>  The survey showed that the disk was killed quite well (I think I won‚Äôt surprise anyone with the fact that the head was scratched by the impact of the head) and how he was surprised by the service technician all this time.  I got a new hard drive for 750 gigs, and I told the technician how I did not notice the brakes, etc.  Touching on the topic of performance, he asked me, why didn‚Äôt they say I‚Äôve squeezed the maximum out of the system?  <i>"- Prots is good, the laptop is not ancient, it would be possible to increase productivity a couple of times, eh?"</i>  I became thoughtful ... <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h4>  Training </h4><br>  Googling a little Yandex learned that there is not so much room for an upgrade, but according to reviews, it adds very good performance, namely: <br><ul><li>  Expansion of RAM to 8 gigs </li><li>  Replacing a DVD-RW drive with an SSD drive </li><li>  Transferring the system to SSD </li></ul><br>  <b>Please note</b> : before the start of all procedures, of course, you need to save your laptop, in order to avoid trouble.  Plus, I pay special attention to the fact that the amount of data on the old disk should not exceed the volume of the new SSD disk, otherwise it is possible that you cannot copy all the data when transferring the system.  Drain everything somewhere for a while, then return to the place. <br><br><h5>  Expanding RAM </h5><br>  Absolutely nothing new and interesting will not tell.  Apple give the opportunity to replace the memory yourself, on their website there is a <a href="http://support.apple.com/kb/HT1270%3Fviewlocale%3Dru_RU">detailed instruction</a> .  Choose your laptop model and click the link for a list of memory characteristics for your device.  For myself, I chose DDR3, 4GB, Kingston, KVR1066D3S7 / 4G, and the price allowed the feature and, importantly, the feedback on this memory, half of which concerned just MacBook.  Spun, pasted, spun - earned.  I didn‚Äôt feel a huge increase in performance, it is noticeable when working in heavy applications.  In particular, when working at Aperture, the brakes disappeared and drawing takes place almost instantly (against long downloads and brakes earlier). <br><br><h5>  SSD installation </h5><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/5ac/63c/361/5ac63c36124abab44a7aaeb8e31d3fcd.jpg" alt="image" align="right">  To mount the second disk (we will have an SSD, but you can also have a HDD) you will <a href="http://www.mcetech.com/optibay/">not</a> need <a href="http://www.mcetech.com/optibay/">OptiBay</a> - a kind of adapter-container where the disk is placed, and then this design is installed at the place of the drive.  On sale there are both branded for $ 100, and noname from $ 50 and more. <br>  Next - you need the SSD drive itself.  Here the scope for choice is huge, everyone is free to choose what he likes more (and with regard to SSD - also on the wallet).  I followed the recommendations of the booted and took the <a href="">Intel X25 SSD</a> .  In terms of needs and prices the best option. <br>  The way of disassembling and assembling the laptop is clearly depicted in an <a href="http://lifehacker.com/5541774/how-to-install-a-solid%2Bstate-drive-in-your-macbook">article on lifehacker.com</a> devoted to this issue.  In my opinion, the article is too chewed, and the whole process is easily denoted by one picture: <br><img src="http://cache.gawkerassets.com/assets/images/17/2011/09/img_0144.jpg" alt="image"><br><ol><li>  Immediately after removing the cover, touch the metal part of the drive in order to remove static voltage. </li><li>  Remove the three screws (orange markers) and disconnect the cable (red marker) </li></ol><br>  After we install the slide with a new disk to the drive, we install loops and close the lid.  All finished with the iron part, go to the software.

    <h5>  System Migration to SSD </h5><br>  If the organ replacement operation was successful and the patient was still alive, then the disk utility will show us such a beautiful picture: <br><br><img src="http://img.skitch.com/20111003-d7wm5sb55iiwcwhwc2wkmmyacs.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  The system safely accepted the new drive, we can begin the process of moving. <br>  If you have a 10.6 Snow Leopard system, then for installation you will need an external drive to reinstall the OS from the disk.  If you already have 10.7 Lion, then you can be delivered either from a bootable USB flash drive or directly from the Internet. <br>  We boldly send our machine to reboot and at the start of the system we hold the ‚Äúcmd + r‚Äù keys to boot into the ‚ÄúUtilities Mac OS X‚Äù mode and see the menu with the ‚ÄúReinstall Mac OS X‚Äù magic item.  We roll a new one in the OS on a freshly baked SSD system disk.  When the new OS is ready, it will offer us several options for installations - as a completely new one, or to transfer the old data.  Select the item ‚ÄúTransfer data from another disk‚Äù and specify the old hard drive to import all settings, applications and user folders.  A cup of hot tea, with ten minutes of waiting - and a new axis is ready. <br><br><h5>  Migrate user folders </h5><br>  MacOSi‚Äôs peculiarity is that it does not provide a transparent mechanism for transferring user folders, but is slightly hidden. <br>  Since now all the data we have on the SSD, I would recommend formatting the old HDD before the transfer operation.  Formatted?  Ok, now we copy the user folder to a new disk, open ‚Äúsettings‚Äù -&gt; ‚Äúusers and groups‚Äù and hold down the Ctrl key and click on our account - the ‚Äúadditional parameters‚Äù item will appear. <br><br><img src="http://img.skitch.com/20111003-rucudbweqq8etx71ih4dsgehbe.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Here we indicate the path to the new user folder (where it was copied).  We kill the old and reboot. <br>  ... <br>  PROFIT! <br><br><h5>  Several additions </h5><br>  1) I did not use disk cloning for two reasons.  The first is the recommendation of the technician himself.  "- There are no problems with overloading the old OS, but why should old mistakes be made" (these are his words). <br>  Secondly, after cleaning the disk from the old content, I found that it actually did not go away, and instead of 40 gigs I used that were displayed by the Finder, the disk utility said that I use 200 gigs, so the 80GB SSD clone is not possible ( <a href="">proof</a> ) .  I read that it is being treated with the ‚Äúerasure of free space‚Äù, but why would I need a procedure at 3 o'clock when the roll-in of the new axis from the Internet took me 55 minutes (from a flash drive or disk probably faster) <br><br>  2) to copy the user folder, you can use the terminal with the command: <br>  <code>sudo cp -rp /Users/Name /Volumes/NewVolume/Folder</code> (did not check, data is taken from <a href="http://itime.me/%3Fp%3D421">itime.me</a> ) <br><br>  3) I described this manual as an upgrade of macbook pro (mid 2010), but according to data from apple.com, I can estimate what works for all applications starting from 2009 <br><br>  Well, strictly speaking - that's all! <br><br>  I regret a bit that I didn‚Äôt make a benchmark before installing a new memory and after, I can give only two examples from my practice - <a href="http://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aperture_(%25D0%25BF%25D1%2580%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B3%25D1%2580%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BC%25D0%25BC%25D0%25B0)">Aperture</a> started about 30 seconds before the upgrade (start + opening of the library), now it takes about 2 seconds to complete the cold start process.  The second test doubled the load - while working in Apertur I launched the video conversion in HandBrake - the coolers rustled, but the performance remained at the same level! <br>  More than confident that at least two years I will not wonder about the upgrade of the piece of iron. <br><br>  Thanks, I will be glad to comments and comments. <br><br>  <b>UPD:</b> A similar article a year ago - <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/hardware/114469/">habrahabr.ru/blogs/hardware/114469</a> When I did not see the publication, good habrayusers suggested.  If it interferes, I'll put it in drafts. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/129772/">https://habr.com/ru/post/129772/</a></p>
