    <h5>  Preface by Scott Chacon </h5><br>  Here is the second edition of the book.  The first version saw the light four years ago.  Much has changed since that time, although the most important things have remained unshakable.  Most of the key teams and concepts are still applicable, because Git-developers are making a lot of effort to maintain backward compatibility, but there have also been significant innovations and changes in the community surrounding the Git system.  The second edition of the book provides a story about these changes and updates, which will help new users get up to speed. <br><br>  At the time of the writing of the first book, the Git system was relatively complex and in essence was a tool targeted at an experienced developer.  In some communities, it began to gain popularity, but before its widespread use, which we observe today, was far away.  Nevertheless, gradually this system was adopted by almost all open source software communities.  The emergence of a huge number of graphical interfaces for all platforms and IDE support made it possible to embed Git into Windows operating systems.  In the first edition of the book about this was not the question.  One of the main objectives of the new edition is to consider all these innovations. <br><br>  The number of open source software developers using the Git system has also increased dramatically.  Almost five years ago, the beginning of work on the first version of the book (and the writing process took some time) coincided with the beginning of my work in a little-known company engaged in creating a website for hosting Git.  This site was called GitHub.  By the time of the publication of the book, the site was used by a thousand people, and only the four of us worked on it.  At the time of this writing, GitHub announced the deployment of a 10 million project.  The number of registered developers has reached almost 5 million, and the number of employees has exceeded 230. Whether you like it or not, the GitHub project influenced the open source community to the extent that I couldn‚Äôt even imagine when I started working above the first book. <br><br>  In the original version of the book, I dedicated a small section to the GitHub site, describing it as a place to host the Git system.  I didn‚Äôt really like that, in fact, I‚Äôm writing about a public resource, at the same time telling about my role in its creation.  I still don‚Äôt like this conflict of interest, but the importance of the GitHub project in the Git community has long been undeniable.  Therefore, now I have decided not to limit myself to the example of Git hosting, but to highlight a whole chapter for a detailed description of the GitHub project and how to use it effectively.  If you are going to learn Git, the ability to work with the GitHub site will help you to join a huge community, no matter what kind of hosting you use to store your code. <br><br>  Another significant change since the previous publication was the development and growing use of the HTTP protocol for network Git operations.  The majority of examples in the book, instead of the SSH protocol, feature a simpler HTTP protocol. <br><br>  It's amazing to see how Git has evolved over the past few years from virtually unknown to the dominant version control system, both for commercial purposes and for open source projects. <br><br>  I hope you enjoy reading the new version of the book. <br><br><h5>  Preface by Ben Straub </h5><br>  My interest in the Git system was caused precisely by the first edition of this book.  I learned a way to create software that is more natural than anything I've seen before.  At this point, I was a developer for several years, but this event helped me to take a much more interesting road. <br><br>  Now, years later, I am a co-author of one of the main implementations of Git, I have worked and work for the largest Git hosting company, teaching people all over the world to use it.  When Scott asked if I wanted to take part in the preparation of the second edition of the book, I agreed without hesitation. <br><br>  It is a great honor for me, and in the process of work I received great pleasure.  I hope this book will help you to the same extent that it helped me. <br><br><h5>  About the authors </h5><br>  Scott Chacon is co-founder and investment director of the GitHub project.  He is also the administrator of the official <a href="http://git-scm.com/">Git</a> site.  Scott Chacon has participated in dozens of conferences dedicated to Git, GitHub and the future of these systems. <br><br>  Ben Straub is a long-time developer of the Libgit2 project, a Git lecturer and teacher at the international level, a book lover, an eternal researcher, a person who masters the art of creating great software.  He lives with his wife and two children in Portland, Oregon. <br><br>  More information about the book can be found on <a href="http://www.piter.com/collection/A31291/product/git-dlya-professionalnogo-programmista">the publisher's website.</a> <br>  <a href="http://storage.piter.com/upload/contents/978549601763/978549601763_X.pdf">Table of contents</a> <br>  <a href="http://storage.piter.com/upload/contents/978549601763/978549601763_p.pdf">Excerpt</a> <br><br>  For Habrozhiteley 25% coupon discount - <b>Pro Git</b> <br><br>  According to reviews from a previous <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/piter/blog/266417/">post,</a> once again after the payment of a paper book, we send e-mails of books to the e-mail; when buying an e-book, all available versions are sent to users. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/266877/">https://habr.com/ru/post/266877/</a></p>
