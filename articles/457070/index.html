A couple of words about the interactive badge OFFZONE 2019</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/mt/pp/0q/mtpp0qyxzdwemhsaj-tmea2kpea.jpeg" alt="image"><br><br>  What is the beginning of the conference?  Of course, with a badge!  This is the first thing you get at the entrance, the whole day (or several) you are inseparable from it, and then it hangs over your table, reminding others about your cosmic toughness and professionalism. <br><br>  Therefore, we try to make the badge for the international conference on practical security <a href="https://offzone.moscow/ru/">OFFZONE</a> memorable.  OFFZONE 2018 badge cards were full-fledged computers based on an 8-bit processor with JVM on board.  And at OFFZONE 2019 (June 17‚Äì18), the role of a participant badge was played by an interactive printed circuit board, made, in accordance with the general conference style, in the form of a 3.5-inch diskette.  Oldy here ?! <br><a name="habracut"></a><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/pz/ep/c1/pzepc1xwqry6enk7zk-hc--4aa0.jpeg" alt="image"><br><h3>  Badge: the beginning </h3><br>  Each participant at the conference received a badge-board and a set of four AAA batteries upon registration.  You insert batteries - the badge happily greets you with a merry-go-round from all the colors of the rainbow.

      Badge pleased the eye and collected huskies on instagram, but this is not its main functionality.  Even in the base case, it served as a purse for OFFCOIN - the official currency of the conference.  It was received for solving various tasks and exchanged for a company merch. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/fz/8i/7l/fz8i7lheagwnxncxrp-88r6khwk.jpeg" alt="image"><br><br>  The ‚Äúbasic delivery‚Äù of the badge included a microcontroller with the necessary strapping, a power supply system and an IR transmitter.  This is not bad, but sometimes the soul requires a holiday.  In this case, the badge had hidden features. <br><br><h3>  Badge: advanced level </h3><br>  The first rule of the IB conference is to break everything, including badges.  We did not move away from the tradition, but modified it a little: in order to crack our luminous board, it was necessary to ‚Äúfix‚Äù it first - to solder the missing electronic components with our own hands. <br><br>  All upgrades for the badge could be found in two ways.  The first, for attentive ones, is to study the <a href="https://offzone.moscow/badge">instructions on the conference website</a> .  The second, for the impatient, is to arrange an interrogation with addiction to one of the organizers at the site. <br><br>  Both methods led participants to the soldering zone.  And then the fun began!  Coil solder, the smell of flux and other pleasures, previously available only to radio amateurs. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/5b/hc/ux/5bhcuxxck5fnze17mgm320c6hs8.jpeg" alt="image"><br><br><h3>  5 steps to a customized badge </h3><br>  The first step to upgrade the badge was to solder the DIP Switch to 8 switches and 8 resistors R8-R15 with a nominal value of 220 Ohms and the size smd 0603 on the opposite side of the board.  DIP Switch made it possible to switch the mode of the badge, and also opened up access to the first task. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/kp/ci/jf/kpcijfvvstmieg7beyzdsiomgbw.jpeg" alt="image"><br><br>  In the first task, it was necessary to put the lower four digits of the switches into such a combination, so that all four LEDs would turn green.  As soon as this happened, the badge in USB via the COM port sent the participant a flag. <br><br>  Some explanations for those who did not have time to go to the soldering area at the conference and want to repeat the trick at home.  The upper four digits of the switch determine what mode the badge will start after the restart.  The position of these switches should be interpreted as representing a binary number: the eighth switch in the ON position is 0001, the seventh ON is 0010, the eighth and sixth ON is 0101, and so on.  Tasks had numbers from 1 to 5. State 0 - purse mode OFFCOIN. <br><br>  For the second task, it was necessary to mount a miniature 0.96-inch OLED display with an I2C interface and a pair of jumpers.  This task can also be reproduced not only on the OFFZONE site, so here is the instruction. <br><br>  It's simple.  The display is a PLS-4 connector, and the jumpers are R2 and R5 smd 0603 resistors. They soldered, chose mode 2 on the DIP Switch, restarted the badge, waited for the end of the loading process of the program, passed the epileptic test and now you can play Flappy Quote. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/w3/-q/pd/w3-qpddzfgm1t7pvdkvpnilgb-c.jpeg" alt="image"><br><br>  The goal of the task is to pass the 1337 gate with a quotation mark and not die.  Hands to do it is not so easy.  However, if you connect to the badge via COM-port in the Flappy Quote mode, you can see a lot of useful information - it will be enough to write your bot!  The goal at 1337 gate no longer looks so frightening. <br><br>  In the third step, it was possible to solder a simple IR receiver TSOP38238, find a badge in the soldering zone set by the organizers and accept the package that is being transmitted there.  The package was a 7ZIP archive, which contained the compressed FAT12 file system.  It was necessary to delve into it and find the flag. <br><br>  Then participants could solder the RC-522 RFID transceiver, in the zone with tasks for hacking IoT devices, find the marked pass card, dump it, dig in the dumps, notice some interesting features in them, correct the data and write to their blank card.  If everything is done correctly, the verification of the map on the IoT zone was successful and the participant received a flag. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/i7/iy/7p/i7iy7pce3dta32993e1lmetnznc.jpeg" alt="image"><br><br>  For the last assignment, we had a 433 MHz radio band and two modules: a receiver and a transmitter.  With the help of radio, chat was implemented for all owners of these modules, as well as the search for a source of flag transmission that runs constantly to and fro.  It was necessary just to walk on OFFZONE, to stare at the sides and catch radio packages.  One of them contained the desired flag. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/gx/ba/ab/gxbaabpyrtza8yyubvyhv1byz90.jpeg" alt="image"><br><br>  The last three tasks can no longer be done - the necessary conditions were only on OFFZONE.  But if you want, you can always complete the modification! <br><br><h3>  Additional Information </h3><br><ul><li><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Badge scheme</b> <div class="spoiler_text"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/jh/uw/16/jhuw16yjjjbi2v6ihzauk2dhtxo.png" alt="image"><br></div></div></li><li>  <a href="https://github.com/rogerclarkmelbourne/Arduino_STM32/tree/master/drivers/win">COM port driver</a> </li><li>  <a href="https://www.chipdip.ru/product/sbs1008">Dip switch</a> </li><li>  <a href="https://www.chipdip.ru/product0/34802">220 ohm smd 0603</a> </li><li>  <a href="https://ru.aliexpress.com/item/4pin-0-96-0-96/32835854912.html%3Fspm%3Da2g0v.search0604.3.10.527b2900MR7TxG%26transAbTest%3Dae803_4%26ws_ab_test%3Dsearchweb0_0%252Csearchweb201602_8_10065_10068_319_317_10696_453_10084_454_10083_10618_10307_10301_537_536_10059_10884_10887_321_322_10915_10103_10914_10911_10910%252Csearchweb201603_52%252CppcSwitch_0%26algo_pvid%3D6869e195-ddd3-48bd-a5e4-8486a4cea4d2%26algo_expid%3D6869e195-ddd3-48bd-a5e4-8486a4cea4d2-1">I2C OLED display</a> </li><li>  <a href="https://www.chipdip.ru/product0/9000070541">0 ohm smd 0603</a> </li><li>  <a href="https://www.chipdip.ru/product0/8997557748">IR receiver TSOP38238</a> </li><li>  <a href="https://ru.aliexpress.com/item/Free-Shipping-RFID-module-RC522-Kits-S50-13-56-Mhz-6cm-With-Tags-SPI-Write-Read/32523771442.html%3Fspm%3Da2g0v.search0604.3.2.390572c2dLne6X%26ws_ab_test%3Dsearchweb0_0,searchweb201602_8_10065_10068_319_317_10696_453_10084_454_10083_10618_10307_10301_537_536_10059_10884_10887_321_322_10915_10103_10914_10911_10910,searchweb201603_52,ppcSwitch_0%26algo_expid%3Df65d6df3-b6aa-4b76-ace8-62b59605c767-0%26algo_pvid%3Df65d6df3-b6aa-4b76-ace8-62b59605c767%26transAbTest%3Dae803_4">RC-522 RFID Transceiver</a> </li><li>  <a href="https://www.chipdip.ru/product/433mhz-kit-transceiver">433MHz receiver transmitter</a> </li></ul></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/457070/">https://habr.com/ru/post/457070/</a></p>
