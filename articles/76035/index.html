      Remembering the covenant, drawn in my childhood in some clever book - ‚Äúa real man should be able to do everything‚Äù, I set aside the keyboard and picked up a needle and thread. <br><br>  The story continues under the cut, carefully, photos. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  Ideas should be implemented quickly, so on Saturday morning I rushed to the shops with fabrics and accessories. <br><br>  In the course of this race were bought: <br><ul><li>  white fur, a piece of 80x140 </li><li>  blue fur, 20x140 </li><li>  two oblong buttons with legs </li><li>  needles with threads, since I had never been born in my hostel, and it would be suspicious to ask my wife. </li><li>  packing holofiber for pillows. </li></ul><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/ce6/f48/e06/ce6f48e06aaf6221655cdafd3c8d714a.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Carefully looking at the future animal, I realized that it is the shape of the body like a hat.  The Internet obligingly issued a pattern of a hat, which I printed out, cut out with an allowance for seams and circled the pencil on the inside of the fur. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/224/8b9/95d/2248b995d09b706b5f13a45299daf7a0.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Cutting out body parts <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/7df/4b2/8e6/7df4b28e69482602600541d0bad725ba.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  On the pattern it is written that four parts are required, but the estimation showed that three is quite enough. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/818/4b1/114/8184b1114af2dfe532cfcd20b70d8633.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Almost without mats, it was possible to thread a needle into a needle =) We sew the obtained parts from the inside out with an overlay stitch (I don‚Äôt know what it is called correctly, but this is the easiest way to sew the fur - with the thread being thrown over the top of the seam) <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/cd3/cd0/e99/cd3cd0e991af2467588a31ee95430f99.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Next, I put aside the body and took hold of the ears.  He took all sizes from the baldies for an exclusive =) Approximate proportions removed with a ruler from the picture on the monitor.  The pencil does not write on blue - we take a piece of soap, in childhood I saw what they draw on a dark fabric. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/47f/224/79c/47f22479c1793d8892d623bd5796f832.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  I sewed it from the inside out with the same stitch and twisted it, it turned out to be quite decent ears =) <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/f8b/4f6/b49/f8b4f6b4921099aedd4ed04857e6103c.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  They filled my ears with holofiber, they say, it looks like ice cream =) <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/0d1/854/fc8/0d1854fc847b3faf2b1de6a8bb3d7421.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Then the question arose - how to properly attach the ears to the body.  Sew on top - unaesthetic, use buttons - not very durable.  The decision prompted the roommate to make a cut in the fur, insert the ear in it and stitch it around the edges of the cut from the inside.  The incision had to be sewn in the middle so that the holofiber was not poured from the ear into the body. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/cea/1b0/e2a/cea1b0e2a0bc7ea20a31579a71893998.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  While the body is not yet full - he sewed his eyes.  It turned out only from the second attempt, for the first time the right eye turned out below the left.  The animal already acquires its features, but so far flat =) <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/05a/d0b/872/05ad0b8726c3d352028a0969839db782.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  At the beginning of the topic, I wrote that the ancestor of the animal is a hat =) and here is the proof: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/77a/3ee/56c/77a3ee56cd16a86ff3c32e3cab1a4896.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  The most difficult thing is to sew the bottom.  It is a circle of fur, the diameter of which is calculated through the circumference - the sum of the lengths of the lower parts of the side elements.  Immunity was turned inside out for sewing the bottom: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/3f3/7fb/c94/3f37fbc94993f1de3df0535fd38b2110.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  As a result, a small hole was left under the diameter of the hand for stuffing.  Filled with holofiber and scraps of fur. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/a44/c91/eed/a44c91eed16d28279f9ad41fbad95c46.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  The hole was sewn up not from the inside out but from the front side, it was hidden in the fur. <br>  The animal turned out a little more in height than the sample, because in the pattern I did not take into account the convexity of the "bottom".  But in general, I consider the work successful =) <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/bdb/a71/647/bdba716475703398468c4162b29e5ef5.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  As a result, we can draw several conclusions: <br>  - material costs are low, but labor costs are quite tangible, it took about 5 hours to make a toy. <br>  - even in the complete absence of experience it turns out well, the fur forgives a lot of mistakes <br>  - the material still has at least three immunities <br>  - happiness from owning is priceless =) <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/510/d29/863/510d29863e18dd7e74e6e6c9ec4ce5e3.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Wife happy: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/3a0/9dc/759/3a09dc759b9e10b88eb4114cc237bce7.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  And forgive me marketers wimm-bill-dana =) <br><br>  And now, anticipating the questions "and what's the habr." <br>  I know that a lot of competent lawyers live here.  So, I am interested in the question - what is the punishment for making such toys (in the form of popular characters) to order for money?  What toys can be made, and which - is illegal? <br><br>  Thank you for your attention =) <br><br>  <b>PS</b> In order to at least somehow remain in the subject of Habr - a microcircuit: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/e67/e99/0e8/e67e990e8a97b493e03f4e82cfa1a768.jpg" alt="image"><br>  What is this chip, but if it is necessary - let it be =))) </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/76035/">https://habr.com/ru/post/76035/</a></p>
