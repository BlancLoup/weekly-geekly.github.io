      Actually, the name was born on the basis of the concept of COMMUNICATION as a platform, which means everything, from a link in a blog to a voice mention in a podcast or text status on a social network. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  Despite the ‚Äúuniversality of media‚Äù, we do not declare the functionality of the dogma implemented in the first version, it‚Äôs much more important for us now to just start working in one form or another (allowing for so-called ‚Äúfeature cutting‚Äù), having debugged interaction with advertisers, mentioners, tax and other structures  By standardizing the interaction between the participants of the process outside and inside the company in the minimum configuration to exit at least zero, we plan to develop the functionality of the resource further. <br><br>  On the current functionality, everything is very simple: <br>  - blogger?  Sell ‚Äã‚Äãreviews-guards; <br>  - Do you chat on the forum?  Sell ‚Äã‚Äãpaid posts (from the organization of thematic threads to responses with links and just references to the advertiser‚Äôs products or services), signatures and even URLs in the profile; <br>  - Podcaster?  Sell ‚Äã‚Äãmentions in the podcast and links shounotah banners; <br>  - Webmaster?  Sell ‚Äã‚Äãlinks and banners (while static with manual insertion, but on the approach is automatic by analogy with ‚ÄúSapa‚Äù); <br>  - Using Twitter?  Sell ‚Äã‚Äãtweets; <br>  - Hang out in the social sphere?  Sell ‚Äã‚Äãany mention that only allows the social network (statuses, blog entries and on the walls, etc.); <br>  - Can you write and publish reviews to order?  Welcome! <br><br>  As a result, after the opening of the Indicator, the advertiser gets the opportunity to ‚Äúsow‚Äù more widely and more budgetally than now.  On the rest of the pros look on.  :-) <br><br>  Talking about the project to friends (offering to evaluate the logo, the next design, test beta versions, etc.) we received questions, the answers to which are posted here. <br><br>  <b>Q. What is it?</b> <br>  A. In the first version, the project is implemented as a cross between blogun.ru and hiddenmarketing.ru. <br>  Blogun is good where you need to buy a lot of links, but some bloggers on ‚ÄúBlogun" are still ... sly - linking and banging in a couple of weeks. NO blogger‚Äôs control over that! (Or rather, there is a third-party service, but no direct blogging relations). We know how to solve the problem with dishonest performers (look further about the rating of the mentions). One more thing - to put it mildly, an incredible commission. If you feed the advertising budget into Blogun, then out of the $ 1,000 you contributed, 700 (in the best scenario, depending  tons of replenishment methods.) Is this normal? We believe that this situation ... to put it mildly, is not quite good. The reason is problems with legal accounting. Blogun service, for some unknown reason, doesn‚Äôt really want to become an absolutely white legal entity, using ridiculous ‚Äúservices-laying‚Äù , on that, and the wild interest on input and output. After all, even credit cards they accept "rectally" (through the western service Plimus, mainly specializing in the sale of shareware software, which itself takes a very noticeable interest), and that by bank transfer with them to begin  it is necessary to work to sign a contract (at the same time, the percentage will still be ... very rather big).  One more thing: Blogun can only advertise in blogs, while we have: blogs, podcasts, forums, websites, etc. <br><br>  What is good at hiddenmarketing.ru?  Firstly, more opportunities "seeding".  And very good, but for large offices, which is not always important where the money flies.  Because the prices.  And they are also good because you can come to them, conclude an agreement and everything will be grown-up.  They started first, in ancient times, scored good customers who are not important to save, but the result.  Hiddenmarketing.ru is good for everyone, but you won't go in there with a small budget.  Minus of hiddenmarketing.ru - brought a bag of money under the contract for the campaign and there is already no way to influence the price, bargain, etc.  (not like in the Blogun). <br><br>  <b>Q. What is the ‚ÄúMentioner‚Äù better?</b> <br>  A. And we do not say that we are better or worse.  We are generally different and more.  :-) <br>  We are launching a project that is ‚Äúlegally accounting‚Äù working on the platform of the Russian IP (with partners in Ukraine and Kazakhstan, we will think about the rest later). <br>  Being in the ‚Äú6% simplified payment system‚Äù we can accept payments from individuals and legal entities.  At the same time, we pay Motherland 6% of turnover and something in social insurance and pension.  Well, the salary of developers and support staff (and their payments to the Motherland).  That is, unlike ‚ÄúBlogun‚Äù, we are a white office, which does not have to pay wild interest to laying services, therefore, 1000 rubles driven into the system turns into ... those same 1000 rubles on the balance of the ‚ÄúUpominator‚Äù.  The annual turnover limit (at which a ‚Äúsimplified payment‚Äù is possible) is quite suitable for a start, and if we manage to exceed the limit of 52,000,000 rubles.  before, then ... We know what to do in this case and just dream to live to see this problem !!!  :-) <br><br>  So, being a legitimate element of Russian business, we calmly connected to the plastic services that are adequate and legal in the Russian Federation, on the fly we accept payments through Sberbank (and other banks, the so-called ‚Äútransfer without opening an account‚Äù service is available in almost any bank) from individuals, while advertisers do not lose a significant part of the budget on the commission.  Moreover, commissions are mainly (for example, in the case of billing-processing of plastic cards and replenishment of electronic money) we pay ourselves. <br><br>  How are we different from hiddenmarketing.ru?  Only because the moderator is the advertiser himself (but for an additional fee you can hire our manager), so we are in a very decent position: anyone can come to us as an advertiser, promote their products and services in various types of media without losing too much, bargain (or rather, choose offers with a suitable price) for more favorable accommodation. <br><br>  <b>Q. How can I replenish the advertiser's balance?</b> <br>  A. As mentioned above, legal entities can pay both on the offer and with the conclusion of the contract.  For individuals when replenishing the balance, the Umpirer will appear in all popular payment systems, if not directly, but through partner services (again, you cannot compare MoneyMail with Plimus).  MoneyMail is connected to QIWI-Yandex. Money-Webmoney (and also processes plastic cards responsible for frauds), we work with them as a legal entity and pay a penny interest, and Plimus (which uses Blogun) takes almost half. <br><br>  At the start of the project, we offer the following ways to replenish the balance for individuals: <br>  - Sberbank of the Russian Federation <br>  - Plastic VISA and MASTERCARD cards through Platezh.ru <br>  - MoneyMail (QIWI-Yandex. Money-Webmoney) <br><br>  Next, we plan to ‚Äúpop up‚Äù ourselves in the form of our own buttons in the payment terminals, and directly connect to Yandex.Money and Webmoney (we almost immediately appear in the ‚ÄúQIWI‚Äù personal account, then as buttons on regional networks of terminals, and then turn into a button on ‚ÄúQIWI‚Äù). <br><br>  <b>Q. And what about the mentioners (those who post the mentions in the media)?</b> <br>  A. Individuals receive 75% of the money earned on WMR at the current exchange rate (the ‚ÄúUpominator‚Äù itself works in rubles).  We turn the money earned by the IP into a WMR wallet, and from this wallet, the mentions get the money earned.  Further, their sole concern is how to report to the Motherland.  Something like this, by the way, works with individuals "Runner". <br><br>  And legal entities from the Russian Federation (LLC, IP, etc.) receive their earnings directly to the bank account, with the conclusion of the necessary contracts.  The commission from legal entities is also 25%, but at certain (discussed) turnovers the commission may be less noticeable. <br><br>  <b>Q. What else is good?</b> <br>  A. Our goals for the coming months after launch: <br>  - connection of various payment methods for advertisers (so that any known and LEGAL method is available except for the drift); <br>  - attracting advertisers and references; <br>  - the promotion of the noun as a meme.  To IN RUNET be known as the word BLOGGER; <br>  - debugging service for sustainable work; <br><br>  Moving towards these goals, we continue to improve functionality.  For example, we plan to make a rating of references.  Rating will be generated based on a variety of parameters, which is too early to talk about, but at least this rating will get rid of villains who take money for work and post links on blogs and remove them in 1-2 weeks.  To do this, we are preparing a ‚Äúlink clerk‚Äù, which will promptly ask awesome questions to the mentioner and, in the event of a non-response, block funds on the balance sheet or lower the rating (if money is withdrawn) to both the person and the resource itself (the next time people will want less and less advertise on a blog whose owner permanently rats).  Moreover, we are ready to broadcast this rating for our colleagues through a simple API.  In addition to translating the rating through the API, we are thinking about the possibility of adding resources to the blacklist, here it makes sense to think about authorization. <br><br>  <b>Q. Are advertisers already in mind?</b> <br>  Oh yeah: <br>  - There are offices that ordered websites from us, promotion and consulting throughout the past year.  They are ready to try Upominator. <br>  - There is an advertiser who buys mediyku and billboards in Moscow.  We have a small but noticeable line in the media plan for 2010.  Everything will be OK. <br>  - We will advertise ourselves with the help of ourselves.  Now it is slowly, but after the start everything is more powerful. <br><br>  <b>Q. And what about prices?</b> <br>  A. The minimum price for the mention will be 10 rubles. <br><br>  Further, about the "physical component of the project."  In addition to the white opportunity to invoice and accept cashless settlement, the Uminator has an office and a telephone.  Suppose not yet in Moscow (and in Samara), but - this is a living ‚Äúoffice‚Äù in contrast to dozens of projects being made students on one knee. <br>  Theoretically, you can come to the office of the Recorder for negotiations, you can call (during business hours in Moscow, and then how), send a fax with a receipt of payment through Sberbank, etc.  However, the office will be discussed in detail in one of the following issues. <br><br>  We are thinking of starting in February.  Now the system is operating in closed testing mode.  The blog is open here on Habr√©, Twitter, and you can also leave an e-mail on the site stub to fill our spam database. <br><br>  Thank you for your attention, we will be back soon!  :-) <br><br>  With respect, <br>  Team of the commander. <br><br>  References: <br>  Upominator (stub so far) - <a href="http://www.upominator.ru/">http://www.upominator.ru</a> <br>  Our Twitter - <a href="http://twitter.com/upominator">http://twitter.com/upominator</a> <br><br>  Contact: info [dog] upominator [dot] en <br><br>  <font color="red">PS Dear Sirs silent minusovateli!</font> <font color="red"><br></font>  <font color="red">We will be grateful for <b>constructive</b> criticism.</font>  <font color="red">:-)</font> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/83273/">https://habr.com/ru/post/83273/</a></p>
