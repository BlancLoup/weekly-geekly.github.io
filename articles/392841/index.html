The projector for mobile presentations will be selected according to two main parameters: <br><br><ul><li>  image quality (resolution and color rendition); </li><li>  mobility (weight and dimensions); </li></ul><br>  There are other parameters that may be important or not, depending on the specific user and his tasks, but these two are the main ones.  We will talk about them. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/d88/42c/0bb/d8842c0bb61c4385a79391fefa4ec5cb.jpg"></div><a name="habracut"></a><br><h2>  Universal, it is - a "normal" projector </h2><br>  The most ‚Äúordinary‚Äù and inexpensive projectors, which on the Epson website are referred to as ‚Äú <a href="http://epson.ru/catalog/proj-general/%3FPAGEN_1%3D2">universal projectors for business</a> ‚Äù, are also great for mobile presentations, since  These devices are called "universal" due to the optimal balance of various characteristics.

      Take, for example, <a href="http://epson.ru/catalog/projectors/epson-eb-w04/">Epson EB-W04</a> : <br><br><ul><li>  Dimensions 23 cm x 29 cm at a height of 8 cm (Almost A4 sheet, not counting the thickness) </li><li>  Weight 2.4 kg </li><li>  Comes with a sturdy, handy travel bag. </li><li>  The maximum brightness of 3000 lumens (in the brightest mode, with a normal load on the lamp).  Perfectly enough for a brightly lit office space. </li><li>  The maximum brightness in economy mode is 2100 lumens (which is still very much). </li><li>  The lamp life in economy mode is estimated at 10,000 hours (that is, almost 3.5 years when viewed 8 hours a day, 365 days a year!), After which it is enough to replace it in order to continue working at maximum brightness. </li></ul><br>  We at Epson have our own fleet of projectors that are not stagnant in the warehouse for a long time and are constantly moving from the event to the event: exhibitions, presentations, reviews.  Having a long experience in operating these devices, we know that the projector does not need to be managed in any particular way.  He put it on a car seat or threw it in a backpack, and forward to the presentation. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/bd6/71f/e4b/bd671fe4bf954c66801accfbd6cb9582.jpg"></div><br>  The procedure for installing the projector in a new place is as simple as possible.  If it is not possible to set it directly opposite the screen, geometry correction is performed in a matter of seconds even for the most inexpensive models (the vertical angle is automatically corrected, and for the horizontal one there is a slider behind the lens).  In other words, even the most affordable Epson projectors are designed for use in mobile presentations.  Now, actually, let's talk about image quality. <br><br><h2>  3LCD-time! </h2><br>  We will never tire of recalling such concepts as <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/company/epson/blog/222115/">‚Äú3LCD‚Äù and ‚Äúcolor brightness‚Äù</a> , and how important they are.  When working in a lighted room, you will need the highest possible brightness to create a <b>contrast image</b> (Yes, it is a contrast. See ‚Äúarithmetic‚Äù at the end of the article). <br><br>  Epson projectors have different color modes, the brightest of which is Dynamic.  In this mode, for example, our Epson EB-W04 produces its entire luminous flux of 3000 lumens. <br><br>  The ‚Äútrick‚Äù of a 3LCD projector (and these are all Epson projectors, for example) is that when measuring the ‚Äúbrightness‚Äù of red, green and blue colors when displaying them on the screen, we will get the same 3000 lumens as in the output just a white screen.  This means that <i>in the brightest mode,</i> you get <i>perfectly normal</i> in color brightness and colorful picture.  In other words, you bought a projector from which the brightness of ‚Äú3000 lumens‚Äù was declared in the passport, and in the brightest mode you received a decent image in all respects with an actual brightness equal to the passport, without compromise. <br><br>  An inexpensive projector based on a technology other than 3LCD will not give you a picture with rich colors at maximum brightness.  Why this is so, we have repeatedly told, so we will not repeat, and offer to read the <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/company/epson/blog/222115/">post on the topic</a> . <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/e59/e92/b49/e59e92b4949b4fe996ff2ce3288b4907.jpg"></div><br>  Of course, the balance between the brightness of white and color brightness is not the only way to determine how accurate the color rendition of the projector, but it is a good way to determine when the color rendition is obviously inaccurate.  For maximum accuracy, Epson projectors have special color rendering modes, such as ‚ÄúsRGB‚Äù.  It often happens that the Epson projector's brightness is so high that you can use high precision mode even in a lit room, and if you don‚Äôt need a screen more than 80 inches, then even more so! <br><br>  However, when the light is on, the accuracy requirements fade into the background, minor inaccuracies become imperceptible, and the projector needs more ‚Äúbrute force‚Äù, which allows defeating external lighting and at the same time creating a beautiful image. <br><br>  The main idea of ‚Äã‚Äãall of the above is that <b>all budget Epson ‚Äúuniversal projectors‚Äù are an excellent choice for mobile presentations</b> , as they give an excellent image even in a lit room at a low price and good mobility. <br><br><h2>  ‚ÄúNeed more compactness!‚Äù </h2><br>  Of course, it would be wrong not to have in the model range of specialized compact projectors designed specifically for mobile presentations.  Epson has the famous "17th" series of business projectors, which currently consist of <a href="http://epson.ru/catalog/projectors/epson-eb-1751/">Epson EB-1751</a> , <a href="http://epson.ru/catalog/projectors/epson-eb-1761w/">Epson EB-1761W</a> , <a href="http://epson.ru/catalog/projectors/epson-eb-1771w/">Epson EB-1771W</a> , <a href="http://epson.ru/catalog/projectors/epson-eb-1776w/">Epson EB-1776W models</a> . <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/9e9/4e2/54f/9e94e254fb89418c808c9953af024012.jpg"></div><br>  These projectors give you the same winning combination of white and color brightness, 2600 - 3000 lumens, but with a weight of about 1.6 kg and in a very thin case (5 cm with legs, almost like a laptop).  It may seem that the reduction in mass and thickness up to 65% of an ordinary projector is not such a ‚Äúrevolution‚Äù.  However, taking the 17th series projector in your hand ... in your hand, you suddenly find out that this is a new level of convenience, and the bag with the projector hanging on your shoulder turns out to be completely light. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/6fa/276/5a7/6fa2765a77f04065bc8143b61b5f6ac2.jpg"></div><br>  At the same time, from the point of view of image quality, the difference is almost imperceptible - you still, figuratively speaking, ‚Äúdeliver the maximum fire power to the battlefield‚Äù. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/3ed/5ad/9b3/3ed5ad9b304e4f5393d8a73a36b8db6c.jpg"></div><br>  By the way, Epson‚Äôs approach to creating mobile projectors for presentations is quite unique, since most of the competitors have followed the path of LED one-matrix projectors, of which the following can be said: <br><br><ul><li>  They really allow to achieve even greater compactness; </li><li>  their claimed brightness is more than 3 times <i>lower</i> than that of Epson EB-17xx projectors </li></ul><br>  Add to this the lack of such inherent to all Epson projectors, as well as any other projectors based on 3LCD technology, features such as high "color brightness" in bright modes, as well as the tendency of manufacturers of LED projectors noticed by many experts to <i>overestimate the</i> declared maximum brightness.  The difference in brightness is often so great that it becomes obvious that Epson compact LED projectors and Epson compact 3LCD projectors are completely different classes of devices.  If you want the projector to show itself from the best side in a lit room, then (completely unbiased!) We recommend Epson projectors. <br><br>  In addition, in favor of 3LCD projectors, you can write a ‚Äúnormal matrix‚Äù instead of a diagonal matrix, which is usually placed on compact LED projectors.  The picture supplied to the projector with a diagonal matrix is ‚Äã‚Äãsomewhat distorted, even if it is in the same resolution as the projector's matrix.  For many users, the very existence of diagonal matrices was a complete surprise.  As for the lamp, the resource for Epson projectors of the EB-17xx series is estimated at 4000 hours in bright mode.  If you watch the projector for ... well, let's say, 4 hours a day, 365 days a year, then this will be enough for almost three years, after which you will need to replace only the lamp.  Yes, with LED projectors, a light source is often not considered to be a consumable at all, but you will not get 3000 lumens with it, let alone high-quality color reproduction at maximum passport brightness. <br><br><h2>  Conclusion and conclusions </h2><br>  The simple ‚Äúarithmetic‚Äù proposed in the appendix below shows that even a bright 3000-lumen projector with a flawless ability to display black (that is, with infinite contraction) in a well-lit room gives an image contrast of 13: 1.  This is due to ambient lighting and explains why Epson has consistently headed for achieving the best image quality in conditions of fairly bright lighting, which necessarily requires a high maximum brightness and equally high color brightness. <br><br>  In this regard, we emphasize that the Epson line of ‚Äúuniversal projectors‚Äù is the result of a long evolution and is excellent for mobile presentations, combining brightness and excellent image quality with low price and, if possible, compact dimensions.  If you need more mobility, then we offer a line of business projectors with slim-body series EB-17xx. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/913/ddc/c3f/913ddcc3fcd94110be92b789e9a8d0bb.jpg"></div><br>  Unfortunately, we will not be able to touch upon the full list of additional functions of each of these devices within this article.  However, most projectors support LAN connection (as a built-in function, or using a wireless USB module).  An overview of the standard networking capabilities of Epson projectors is provided <a href="https://m.habrahabr.ru/company/epson/blog/234529/">in this article</a> .  For a mobile projector, in particular, the ability to project wirelessly from computers and mobile devices can be particularly significant - Epson projectors allow it.  Many models make it as easy as possible to set up a wireless connection ‚Äî using a special network key (when connected to a computer) or scanning a QR code from the screen (in the case of mobile devices). <br><br>  Below are some parameters of the compact projectors of the EB-17xx series - the model can be selected based on the characteristics of brightness, resolution and wireless network support.  The older model Epson EB-1776W also has additional features for quick installation, such as ‚ÄúScreen Fit‚Äù - a full list of features can be found <a href="http://www.epson.ru/catalog/projectors/epson-eb-1776w/">on the Epson website</a> .  Nevertheless, the presented models are quite noticeably different in price. <br><table><tbody><tr><td></td><td>  <strong>Epson EB-1751</strong> </td><td>  <strong>Epson EB-1761W</strong> </td><td>  <strong>Epson EB-1771W</strong> </td><td>  <strong>Epson EB-1776W</strong> </td></tr><tr><td>  Brightness, max. </td><td>  2600 lumens </td><td>  2600 lumens </td><td>  3000 lumens </td><td>  3000 lumens </td></tr><tr><td>  Brightness, economy mode. </td><td>  1400 lumens </td><td>  1700 lumens </td><td>  1700 lumens </td><td>  1700 lumens </td></tr><tr><td>  Resolution </td><td>  XGA (1024 √ó 768) </td><td>  WXGA (1280 √ó 800) </td><td>  WXGA (1280 √ó 800) </td><td>  WXGA (1280 √ó 800) </td></tr><tr><td>  WiFi support </td><td>  missing </td><td>  optional module </td><td>  optional module </td><td>  built-in </td></tr><tr><td>  Distance to the screen 80 "diagonal </td><td>  1.94‚Äì2.33 m </td><td>  1.81‚Äì2.17 m </td><td>  1.81‚Äì2.17 m </td><td>  1.81‚Äì2.17 m </td></tr><tr><td>  80 "screen size </td><td>  163 cm √ó 122 cm </td><td>  172 cm √ó 108 cm </td><td>  172 cm √ó 108 cm </td><td>  172 cm √ó 108 cm </td></tr></tbody></table><br>  As a universal option for mobile presentations, we recommend one of the <a href="http://www.epson.ru/catalog/proj-general/">universal business projectors of the</a> newest line.  Its curious feature is the improved image contrast due to the installation of matrices based on C2 Fine technology. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/d5a/ff2/304/d5aff23043a7496bbc69532ceafedb0f.jpg"></div><br>  Due to this, the projectors listed below have excellent image quality, both in lit rooms and in the dark.  The lamp life is significantly increased compared to its predecessors, the older models of the line have the support of the MHL standard, which allows you to connect to mobile devices that support this standard, wired and duplicate from the screen to the projector. <br><table><tbody><tr><td></td><td>  <strong>EB-S04</strong> </td><td>  <strong>EB-S31</strong> </td><td>  <strong>EB-X04</strong> </td><td>  <strong>EB-X31</strong> </td><td>  <strong>EB-W04</strong> </td></tr><tr><td>  Brightness, max. </td><td>  3000 lm </td><td>  3200 lm </td><td>  2800 lm </td><td>  3200 lm </td><td>  3000 lm </td></tr><tr><td>  Brightness, economy mode </td><td>  2100 lm </td><td>  2240 lm </td><td>  1960 lm </td><td>  2240 lm </td><td>  2100 lm </td></tr><tr><td>  Lamp life, h </td><td>  5000/10000 </td><td>  5000/10000 </td><td>  5000/10000 </td><td>  5000/10000 </td><td>  5000/10000 </td></tr><tr><td>  Resolution </td><td>  SVGA (800 √ó 600) </td><td>  SVGA (800 √ó 600) </td><td>  XGA (1024 √ó 768) </td><td>  XGA (1024 √ó 768) </td><td>  WXGA (1280 √ó 800) </td></tr><tr><td>  Mhl </td><td>  not </td><td>  not </td><td>  not </td><td>  not </td><td>  not </td></tr><tr><td>  WiFi support </td><td>  optional module </td><td>  optional module </td><td>  optional module </td><td>  optional module </td><td>  optional module </td></tr><tr><td>  Distance to screen </td><td>  2.37-3.21 m * </td><td>  2.37-3.21 m * </td><td>  2.41-2.9 m </td><td>  2.41-2.9 m </td><td>  2.25-2.7 m </td></tr><tr><td>  Screen size </td><td>  1.63 m √ó 1.22 m </td><td>  1.63 m √ó 1.22 m </td><td>  1.63 m √ó 1.22 m </td><td>  1.63 m √ó 1.22 m </td><td>  1.72 m √ó 1.08 m </td></tr><tr><td>  Built-in speaker power </td><td>  1 W </td><td>  2 W </td><td>  1 W </td><td>  2 W </td><td>  1 W </td></tr><tr><td width="723" colspan="10">  <i>* digital zoom</i> </td></tr></tbody></table><br><table><tbody><tr><td></td><td>  <strong>EB-W31</strong> </td><td>  <strong>EB-W32</strong> </td><td>  <strong>EB-U04</strong> </td><td>  <strong>EB-U32</strong> </td></tr><tr><td>  Brightness, max. </td><td>  3200 lm </td><td>  3200 lm </td><td>  3000 lm </td><td>  3200 lm </td></tr><tr><td>  Brightness, economy mode </td><td>  2240 lm </td><td>  2240 lm </td><td>  2100 lm </td><td>  2240 lm </td></tr><tr><td>  Lamp life, h </td><td>  5000/10000 </td><td>  5000/10000 </td><td>  5000/10000 </td><td>  5000/10000 </td></tr><tr><td>  Resolution </td><td>  WXGA (1280 √ó 800) </td><td>  WXGA (1280 √ó 800) </td><td>  WUXGA (1920 √ó 1080) </td><td>  WUXGA (1920 √ó 1080) </td></tr><tr><td>  Mhl </td><td>  Yes </td><td>  Yes </td><td>  Yes </td><td>  Yes </td></tr><tr><td>  WiFi support </td><td>  optional module </td><td>  built-in </td><td>  optional module </td><td>  built-in </td></tr><tr><td>  Distance to screen </td><td>  2.25-2.7 m </td><td>  2.25-2.7 m </td><td> 2.37-2.89 m </td><td>  2.37-2.89 m </td></tr><tr><td>  Screen size </td><td>  1.72 m √ó 1.08 m </td><td>  1.72 m √ó 1.08 m </td><td>  1.72 m √ó 1.08 m </td><td>  1.72 m √ó 1.08 m </td></tr><tr><td>  Built-in speaker power </td><td>  2 W </td><td>  2 W </td><td>  2 W </td><td>  2 W </td></tr><tr><td width="723" colspan="10">  <i>* digital zoom</i> </td></tr></tbody></table><br><h2>  Little arithmetic </h2><br>  200-300 lumen / m <sup>2</sup> (lux) is considered to be the normal illumination of the working surface for an ordinary office.  Suppose that the illumination of the screen is 100-150 lumens / m <sup>2</sup> . <br><br>  If you take a screen with a diagonal of 90 inches (approximately 1.94 m √ó 1.21 m), then its area will be about 2.35 m <sup>2</sup> .  In this case, a projector with a luminous flux of 3000 lumens will give an illumination of white color equal to 1276.6 lux.  This allows us to calculate the image contrast, which will be equal to (1276.6 + 100) / 100.  Those.  <i>in the best case</i> (matte white screen, minimum illumination, etc.) we get a contrast ratio of 13: 1. <br><br>  Surprisingly, but a fact: even such a seemingly small value of contrast is quite enough to get a legible image in a lit room.
