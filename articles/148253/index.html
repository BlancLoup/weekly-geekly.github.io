In 2008, at the age of 13, the boy founded the first startup <a href="http://psdtowp.com/">PSDtoWP.com</a> .  According to customer orders, mainly from Europe and the USA, he created WordPress themes from Photoshop layouts.  After nine months, the site was bought by a large consulting company. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  But the teenager still had a lot of ideas for startups.  During the holidays in Bali in 2011, he read the bestseller of the time, ‚ÄúThe Body in Four Hours,‚Äù in which the original PAGG complex of substances (policosanol, thioctic acid, green tea extract and garlic) was mentioned.  The entrepreneur was immediately lit up with the idea - and after a few hours he registered the domain <a href="http://www.paggstack.com/">PAGGStack.com</a> and contacted the suppliers of the products.  Within a month after returning from the holidays, he adjusted the packaging and sale of "weight loss kits" around the world on a fashionable diet. <br><br>  Another startup, Leichy Groom, was simple.  As a fan of Apple technology, a friend sent an iPad from America, but almost on the first day, when the boy took him to school, a classmate dropped the iPad on a concrete floor, and the tablet crashed on the screen.  ‚ÄúAt that moment I didn‚Äôt have any projects, and my father advised me to launch some website that would bring passive income.  I did just that, ‚Äùsays Leichi, in May 2010 he opened <a href="http://www.ipadcasefinder.com/">iPadCaseFinder.com</a> , a simple filter that showed in the table offers for iPad cases from different vendors.  All outgoing links were affiliate links.  The business went great: a few weeks after launch, the site registered 400 thousand visits, and Amazon generously paid for the affiliate program.  It was a very successful project, and after a few months, he also found his buyer.

      Now Leichi is developing his fourth <a href="http://cardnap.com/">Cardnap</a> startup (finding and selling resale discount cards), he has created 15 jobs with an average salary of $ 79,000 a year, probably the company has a turnover of more than 100 thousand dollars a month.  Not bad for a teenager who, by law, cannot even drink beer and vote in elections. <br><br>  Leichi wants to move to the mecca of Internet business - Silicon Valley, but after graduating from school in December last year, the entrepreneur still cannot get a work visa in the US, because he does not have a higher education or formal skills in the specialty. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/148253/">https://habr.com/ru/post/148253/</a></p>
