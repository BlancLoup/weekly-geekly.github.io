  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Comparison of eCPM ad networks on personal experience</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  There are many advertising network ratings, and I do not pretend to compile another one.  I just have been releasing games for iOS and Android for a long time and used to apply the same monetization scheme in all of them.  Over time, it is very outdated and has ceased to generate a steady income.  I had to change something and to experiment hard with other advertising networks.  It is these experiments that I want to share.  And at once I want to clarify that the following discussion focuses mainly on Russian traffic, which in my applications is about 90%. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  <b><a href="https://www.chartboost.com/">Chartboost</a></b> <br>  In the past and the year before last, this company replenished my bank accounts much better than Apple and Google (here we mean first of all AdMob) combined.  When I managed to bring the game to the Top 5 App Store and stay there for quite a long time, the daily profits from the interstitial banners of the Chartbust sometimes exceeded $ 200.  But all good things come to an end.  And in the autumn of last year, even the game, which has risen to the first place of the top free games, did not bring even hundreds of bucks.  Other projects - eCPM, and with it revenues, began to sink heavily, and the saddest thing was that banners showed less and less (and in fact, once FullRate was almost 100%).  As a result, I replaced Chartboost in my highest-grossing games, and in those where their SDK still remained, over the past 30 days the eCPM only once exceeded $ 1.5 and too often approached zero. <br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/8df/900/000/8df90000019d4318a4729e751444c948.png"></div><br><br>  At the recent DevGAMM conference, I was able to talk with one of the managers of this network, and he confirmed that, indeed, eCPM in Russia has recently sank heavily and is less than $ 1.  So, for those who have traffic, like mine, mostly Russian, you obviously shouldn't use Chartboost.  Well, the rest should be borne in mind that this is still one of the market leaders.  The advantages of this network include the Russian-language interface, free cross-promotion, a mobile application and a huge number of advertising campaign settings, which I often lack in other networks (especially campaign stoppages and blocking unwanted advertisers).  By cons, there is a rather large withdrawal threshold ($ 300), a commission for withdrawing to a bank account ($ 25) and too frequent interruptions in statistics.

      <b><a href="https://apps.admob.com/">Admob</a></b> <br>  This is the only advertising network in all of my free apps.  True, this applies only to small banners.  I began to use interstitials not so long ago, since before that Chartboost was completely fine with me.  I used to be very surprised when other developers, whom I sometimes help with PR, told me that AdMob brings them more than Chartboost.  Well, now I strongly regret that I have not switched to AdMob before.  In May, interstitial banners in iOS gave eCPM $ 2.43 (for all time 2.46). <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/78d/1b0/ae1/78d1b0ae1d234ec49674d2df757d7c96.png"></div><br><br>  For Android, the indicator is much more modest - $ 1.67 in May (for all the time - $ 1.58).  But for this platform I could not get a higher rate in any of the other networks.  For example, in Chartboost eCPM for Android was less than one. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/c6e/f77/bbf/c6ef77bbff0c4fd4a93c29a0866dd908.png"></div><br><br>  Interestingly, in June, eCPM on interstitial banners for iOS increased to 3.09, and for Android, on the contrary, dropped to 1.14.  As for small banners, here the eCPM range is from 0.01 to $ 0.2. <br><br>  It makes little sense to tell more about AdMob - this network and everyone knows that way.  I note only that the eCPM can be greatly influenced by changing the settings.  For example, I sometimes block banners that are shown too often. <br><br>  <b><a href="http://adtoapp.com/">Adtoap</a></b> <br>  This is the Russian platform of programmatic mediation, and it was she who in my games took the place of Chartboost.  In one of the new games I even made an experiment - I put interstitial banners from these networks every other day.  As a result, I earned 200 bucks a week in AdToApp, and only 20 in the charts. However, AdToApp still had a Rewarded video (every other day with Unity), but the exhaust from it was much worse than with full-screen advertising.  That is, anyway, the difference is just huge.  The word AdToApp turned out to be a worthy replacement for the chartbuster.  However, if earlier I consistently received a total eCPM of more than three, and in some games it was more than three and a half, then recently it began to fall.  And now only one (the newest) game has 3.17 in the last 30 days.  A common eCPM slid to a mark of 2.23. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/7ca/190/4f3/7ca1904f36b84e55b944a10080d15a5e.png"></div><br><br>  At the same time for Interstitial it is even less - 2.12, and for video - 3.16.  For Android, similar figures were 0.96 and 1.51, respectively.  Also recently, other problems have begun to occur.  In one of the games, the number of banner impressions was suspiciously small compared to the number of sessions.  Perhaps this is due to the fact that I do not use the entire SDK, but only its pieces, so that the libraries of the same network do not conflict.  But in any case, experiments with advertising networks, I decided to continue.  I‚Äôll add that the minimum withdrawal to AdToApp is $ 100 to PayPal (500 is a bank account) <br><br>  <b><a href="http://appodeal.com/">Appodeal</a></b> <br>  Another Russian programmatic mediation, and what is nice is free.  That is, unlike other commissions from the developers does not take.  I started trying it at the same time as AdToApp, but then Appodeal wasn‚Äôt the best game in terms of the number of hits.  Total eCPM was 3.37. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/ec0/442/154/ec0442154b9a4f87a520c4671754d5b3.png"></div><br><br>  I asked for more up-to-date statistics for May to provide one of the familiar developers. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/91b/7af/74a/91b7af74aeec46419f347c539e09c787.png"></div><br><br>  In general, the numbers are slightly better than those of AdToApp, and I plan to return to Appodeal.  One of the advantages of this network is the presence of a mobile application and a request for payment at any time. <br><br>  <b><a href="http://www.startapp.com/">Startapp</a></b> <br>  I noticed at StartApp a couple of years ago, as a possible replacement for Chartboost for Android.  The effect then turned out better, but not much.  And then I decided to give it up.  This year I returned to this network again, since according to AdToApp statistics, it was she who gave the maximum effect (already for iOS).  And for the first month (and it was April), I really got a good eCPM for Interstitial - 3.29.  And it was all the more surprising that the choice of banners was not too diverse.  And sometimes I saw the same banner several times in a row (in my case, Yandex.Taxi). <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/bbd/d5e/610/bbdd5e610f404c628ccec18c9b9c88de.png"></div><br><br>  However, over the next two months, the eCPM fell by almost half (1.64) for about the same number of hits.  Experimenting with this network is probably worth it.  There are various bonuses and a fairly low payout threshold - $ 50.  Although, perhaps, the bonuses are intended to entice developers. <br><br>  <b><a href="https://unityads.unity3d.com/">Unityity</a></b> <br>  I use UnityAds for the rewarded video, and overall I'm quite happy.  However, this only applies to iOS, where I get eCPM around $ 3 (for Android, 2 times less). <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/322/8f7/d14/3228f7d146a0494e8635544e2950795e.png"></div><br><br>  The minimum withdrawal is $ 100.  But it is very inconvenient that every time you need to fill in the detailed invoice yourself and send it to the post office. <br><br>  <b><a href="https://www.applovin.com/">AppLovin</a></b> <br>  This is another network that I plan to use more often than now.  In iOS, while it is only in one of my games and eCPM on interstitial banners and videos, I received 4.48.  In another game, already for Android, I use it for Rewarded video and for this year I got a crazy eCPM at 6.88. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/62d/5e6/60a/62d5e660a9d04e63b4d17c4b52640f3a.png"></div><br><br>  I recently tried AppLovin in another android game and got eCPM less than 0.8.  What is the reason for this is unclear.  But it‚Äôs too early to draw conclusions, since only a few days have passed.  So I still plan to transfer a few more games on both platforms to AppLovin. <br><br>  One of the main advantages of AppLovin is a low threshold for withdrawing funds.  Only $ 20 when withdrawing to PayPal, which is certainly very important for those who show not so many banners per month. <br><br>  <b><a href="https://home.tapjoy.com/">Tapjoy</a></b> <br>  I use Tapjoy for Rewarded video as a secondary network, that is, when I don‚Äôt give video back to the main one.  So I‚Äôm showing not so many banners.  ECPM for iOS in my area of ‚Äã‚Äã3.5. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/559/88b/6bc/55988b6bc3b44f2aa4edc39f854ee944.png"></div><br><br>  And for Android around 1.5. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/665/0f4/4f6/6650f44f6ed04c27b0c1d24516083b30.png"></div><br><br>  Actually, I really like this network, thanks to the excellent embedded analytics and the rich variety of content shown.  Here, for example, you can show video by push-notification, as in Chartboost, you can create a cross-promotion campaign or send it to some offer.  The minimum withdrawal ($ 250) and the commission ($ 20), of course, do not suit me very much.  But overall, I am very pleased with the capabilities of this system. <br><br>  <b><a href="https://partner.yandex.ru/">Yandex</a></b> <br>  I use the Yandex advertising network only for small banners and lately I‚Äôve got a very attractive eCPM around 20-30 rubles for both iOS and Android.  Sometimes for some eCPM application for a single day it can reach up to 60 rubles, but very rarely.  True, such indicators were established by me far from immediately, but someone might not be established, being in the region of 1-10 rubles.  Why they depend is not entirely clear.  So maybe I just got lucky. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/c21/40c/1d7/c2140c1d72bd415399f6bfcfd24f873c.png"><br><br>  For inter-page banners, Yandex promises eCPM no more than a dollar, so I don‚Äôt use them. <br><br>  <b><a href="https://target.my.com/">Mytarget</a></b> <br>  Well, since I mentioned Yandex, it probably should be said about MyTarget.  Separately, I don‚Äôt use it, but I can provide statistics on MyTarget from AdToApp on interstitial banners for iOS. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/ac9/abf/7f9/ac9abf7f9d6b42a5aeb54a84078a8a66.png"></div><br><br>  Perhaps some will be surprised that I have not written anything about many other well-known networks.  For example, AdColony, Fyber, Heyzap, or Vungle.  But I just haven't used them yet in my applications.  I did not mention some other networks here because, in my opinion, they do not deserve attention.  I will continue my experiments in this direction, which I advise others too.  This can bring hundreds of other extra bucks a month.  One has only to consider that in different games the same network can have a different effect.  Therefore, it is not surprising if someone using the same monetization methods gets eCPM numbers far from those shown in the graphs above. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/304062/">https://habr.com/ru/post/304062/</a></p>
