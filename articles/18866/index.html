Quite possibly, we are dealing with a new art form, it remains only to invent a name for it. <br><br><h1>  This is a PR-campaign of the film in the form of a game with reality.

    <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  <font>The game</font> was a background to the film: the events began in May 2007, that is, almost a year before the release date of the film itself.  During this year, their chain was built by ordinary Internet users, and as a result, the events of the game turned out to be very closely intertwined with the plot of the picture.  The film will be released in Russia on January 18, that is, tomorrow. <br><br><h3>  During the game, the official sites of fictional corporations are created, then in front of the bewildered Internet public, these sites are hacked by their fictional competitors, the film‚Äôs heroes blog on <img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/da9/0e2/fae/da90e2fae4a470c3f2db4fcc0cd7f096.gif" alt="Myspace" title="Myspace">  , communicate with each other and with other users of the social network, fictional companies create real online stores selling real products related to the project world.

In the trailer, a company of young people at a farewell party escorts a friend (they turn to him <b>Rob</b> ) to Japan.  There is a roar during the party, something like an earthquake happens.  Young people watch direct news feed.  During viewing in the frame a young man appears, wearing a T-shirt with the symbols of Slusho!  (non-existent drink from the JJ Abrams series Alias). <br><br>  <font color="grey">On the same day</font> , the site appears <a href="http://www.1-18-08.com/">www.1-18-08.com</a> . <br>  There is only <i>one photo</i> on the site: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/0d8/fc7/50f/0d8fc750f5b6687925e38b14f04d95c8.jpg"><br>  <font color="grey">Close-up of faces of frightened girls, judging by the date, made 3 minutes after watching the news.</font> <br><br>  <font color="grey">The next day</font> , a <i>second photo</i> from the party appears on the site. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/02a/08e/c15/02a08ec1587063f75ab6620e0e9f7095.jpg"><br>  <font color="grey"><b>Rob</b> , who is between a girl and a boy, is poured alcohol into his mouth.</font>  <font color="grey">The photo was taken about half an hour before the first one.</font> <br><br>  <font color="grey">July 10,</font> someone finds a colorful website <a href="http://www.slusho.jp/">www.slusho.jp</a> , the promo site for the drink Slusho! .. <br> <a href="http://slusho.jp/"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/92b/cf7/6ec/92bcf76ec79492dfbeecd7f8345f3a0b.jpg"></a> <br>  It has a ‚ÄúFeedback‚Äù section, but the same automatic answer comes to all messages: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/0c1/be7/d6b/0c1be7d6bd66f8fbc6845f1670017340.jpg"><br>  <font color="grey">Slusho!</font>  <font color="grey">loves your letters!</font>  <font color="grey">Even If You Drink <b>Six</b> - It Will Be Little!</font> <br><br>  In the "History" section (be sure to read it!) It tells about the creators of the drink. <br><br>  Since then, everyone who drinks a drink, tastes the dream of Noriko and becomes a little whale himself, because he wants to drink this drink more and more, and Even If He Drink <b>Six</b> - There Will Be Little !!! <br><br>  <font color="grey">In the next few days</font> , a <i>third</i> appears on the site <a href="http://www.1-18-08.com/">www.1-18-08.com</a> <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/d79/d7c/e4f/d79d7ce4fd0042e6f3da9d74aaca9460.jpg"><br><br>  and <i>black</i> photos: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/4f0/266/040/4f0266040af8dcacd340198ec9153251.jpg"><br><br>  Both of them are photographed some time after the party. <br><br>  <font color="grey">July 24</font> in one of the stores adjacent to the conference Comic-Con, which is frequented by J.J.  Abrams with his projects, a poster appears with the date 1-18-08 and the word MONSTROUS at the top. <br> <a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/matt.uza/UntitledAlbum/photo"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/fff/ce9/f60/fffce9f60c54a2b5260f90429b0b8e97.jpg"></a> <br>  There is a theory that the film will be called that.  At the conference, T-shirts with Slusho symbols are distributed!  and the slogan You Can't Drink Just Six. <br><br>  <font color="grey">On July 27,</font> the <a href="http://www.1-18-08.com/">engine</a> changes to <a href="http://www.1-18-08.com/">www.1-18-08.com</a> : photos can be moved and turned over.  A fifth photo appears, taken about half an hour before the events. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/2cb/3c4/a33/2cb3c4a33abe8f887c1a0597bb7e01f2.jpg"><br>  <font color="grey">Rob between girl and boyfriend.</font>  <font color="grey">The guy in the hands can see the edge of the camera.</font>  <font color="grey">The edge of the red circle is also visible.</font> <br>  On the back of the photo is an inscription made by hand. <br><blockquote> Lascano, Platt and Robbie - January 2008 <br>  Robbie, <br>  Let this photo help the world to find out how hot I am !!! <br>  I'll miss the hell out of here !!! <br>  Love jamie <br></blockquote><br><br>  On the back of the photo, where Rob is poured alcohol into his mouth, there is an inscription in another handwriting: <br><blockquote>  Do not forget who cares about you! <br>  Love j <br></blockquote><br><br>  On the Internet, on Jaime Lazcano's request, there is a girl‚Äôs blog in the photo.  She reads the blogs of her friends.  They practically all each other read and comment on each other's photos.  From the photos you can partially understand who is who on 1-18-08.com and in the teaser.  There are 5 blogs on myspace: <br><br><br><br>  <font color="grey">The next day, the</font> site <a href="http://www.slusho.jp/">www.slusho.jp is</a> updated. <br>  The online store <a href="http://www.store.slusho.jp/">www.store.slusho.jp appears</a> . <br> <a href="http://store.slusho.jp/"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/514/cb0/2e2/514cb02e2649437b8aaa80daf3f75eac.jpg"></a> <br>  In the store, you can really order T-shirts and T-shirts with the Slusho logo! .. Along with the ordered goods, some scraps of the newspaper are sent in Japanese. <br>  In the section ‚ÄúHappy Conversations‚Äù, the little animals speak in quotations, allegedly sent to the site through ‚ÄúFeedback,‚Äù praising a drink or just joking exclamations (‚ÄúWow, I became a whale!‚Äù).  In the ‚ÄúSlusho Tastes!‚Äù Section there is a game where you can add flavors of different fruits to a sea cocktail to create your own unique Slusho flavors! <br><br>  <font color="grey">On August 1,</font> new theories about the title of the film appear: <br>  1-18-08, Slusho !, Chocolate, Cheese, Found (as anonymous to LOST), Colossus, Overnight, Bold Futura.  Someone finds an interesting <a href="http://tarr.uspto.gov/servlet/tarr%3Fregser%3Dserial%26entry%3D77229626">entry in the database of the US Patent Office</a> . <br> <a href="http://tarr.uspto.gov/servlet/tarr%3Fregser%3Dserial%26entry%3D77229626"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/e2e/988/7ea/e2e9887eaf8467a1b2afd19eb713e134.jpg"></a> <br>  From it follows that the company that registered the trademark Slusho!  it is called Bold Futura, LLC. <br><br>  <font color="grey">On August 10,</font> after analyzing scans of sent-in newspaper scraps posted on the Internet, some Internet user finds out that these are pieces of the real Japanese free newspaper <a href="http://www.nikkansan.com/%2522">Nikkan San</a> (the Japanese version of The Daily Sun) that can be found in Hawaii, California and New York. York <br><br>  <font color="grey">On August 21,</font> quotes are updated in the section ‚ÄúHappy Conversations‚Äù on the website <a href="http://www.slusho.jp/">www.slusho.jp</a> . Among them is the exclamation ‚ÄúBLOOP!‚Äù. <br><br><br>  <font color="grey">August 24, the</font> site <a href="http://www.1-18-08.com/">www.1-18-08.com is</a> updated.  Every 6 (six - remember) minutes flash loses a terrible roar that is very frightening for those who went to the site and got distracted.  (I was scared just during the preparation of this material - Comm.). <br><br>  <font color="grey">August 31,</font> Jamie Lazcano updates his blog.  <a href="http://blog.myspace.com/index.cfm%3Ffuseaction%3Dblog.view%26FriendID%3D217778567%26blogMonth%3D8%26blogDay%3D31%26blogYear%3D2007">She writes</a> that she misses Teddy Hanssen, whom she seems to be in love with.  Only they managed to get close, as he immediately went somewhere, and now she wants him even more. <br><br>  <font color="grey">In September</font> , new entries appear in blogs.  With the help of one of them, it can be understood that Marlena advised Jamie to create a video blog in which she would upload videos specifically for her beloved, and it seems that the advice came in handy. <blockquote>  Jamie -&gt; LenaDia: Hey, girlfriend!  It really caught his attention.  Teddy Bear called me the last three days, and every time we chatted for 3 hours. I miss the owner of this voice!  He says that he has already seen it ten times, and he demands more!  So cute! </blockquote>  (http://profile.myspace.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=user.viewprofile&amp;friendid=201292208, at the bottom of the page) <br><br>  By keywords from the messages find another site: <a href="http://www.jamieandteddy.com/">www.JamieAndTeddy.com</a> . <br> <a href="http://www.jamieandteddy.com/"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/3b7/f7c/f58/3b7f7cf58d3c6a6161120b19f2056a66.jpg"></a> <br><br>  Some of the fans either pick up the password to the site, or it is secretly ‚Äúpoured‚Äù to it.  The password is jllovesth (Jamie Lascano loves Teddy Hanssen).  Apparently, this is the vlog.  There is a <a href="">video</a> on the site: Jamie signs in love with Teddy, and we also find out that at the time of the shooting Teddy had already left for some kind of trip, so she would post video messages for him here.  Jamie forgets to turn off the camera, and the tape is what she tells Marlene that she has caught some <i>bladder infection</i> . <br><br>  <font color="grey">September 29</font> on the site <a href="http://www.1-18-08.com/">www.1-18-08.com</a> appears the <i>sixth</i> ( <i>for good reason this figure</i> ) photo, which depicts a Japanese cook with a dish in his hands. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/b28/dd3/a06/b28dd3a06da2f476301dce333f11ba51.jpg"><br>  On the back of the photo is a recipe in Japanese.  After the usual known ingredients, the last in the list is a pinch of nectar from the sea bottom (kaitei no mitsu), which should be added to the sauce for the dish. <br>  The name of nectar in Japanese and English was <a href="http://www.google.com/search%3Fhl%3Den%26client%3Dfirefox-a%26rls%3Dorg.mozilla:ru:official%26sa%3DX%26oi%3Dspell%26resnum%3D0%26ct%3Dresult%26cd%3D1%26q%3Dkaitei%2Bno%2Bmitsu,%2BSeabeds%2BNectar%26spell%3D1">searched in Google</a> and found a page with reviews of the restaurant on the famous menuism.com site.  Restaurant reviews mention the words monstrous and monster in idiomatic terms several times.  One of the reviews also says that everyone likes nectar from the bottom of the sea, which, according to the chef, is supplied by Tagruato (Honshu, Japan). <br><br>  So the fourth site, <a href="http://www.tagruado.jp/">www.tagruado.jp</a> , was found. <br> <a href="http://www.tagruado.jp/"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/c56/f47/a0a/c56f47a0abdf86b2f2daa49738540917.jpg"></a> <br><br><h1>  To be continued... </h1><br><br>  <font color="black">In the following series:</font> <font color="black"><br><br></font>  <font color="black">- According to information from the site, the CEO of the company is the same Ghana Yoshida.</font> <font color="black"><br><br></font>  <font color="black">‚ÄúIt turns out that slusho!, Like bold futura, are subsidiaries of tagruato.jp, as are a few of those that will be featured in the quest.</font> <font color="black"><br></font>  <font color="black">The tagruato company is engaged in genetic research at the bottom of the ocean, and they are building drilling rigs, one of which is to open near New York.</font> <font color="black"><br><br></font>  <font color="black">‚ÄúTeddy Henssen disappears and then gives Jamie a strange gift.‚Äù</font> <font color="black"><br><br></font>  <font color="black">- Drink Slusho !, probably leads to infection with an unknown infection.</font>  <font color="black">The researcher who suggested this is dying under unclear circumstances.</font> <font color="black"><br><br></font>  <font color="black">‚ÄúThe site tagruato.jp is cracked by unknown ill-wishers with whom, as it turns out, the missing Teddy Hanssen is somehow connected.</font> <font color="black"><br><br></font>  <font color="black">- And some more facts and documents that shed light on what is happening.</font> <br><br>  <font color="grey">The article was prepared based on the <a href="http://theos.livejournal.com/">theos.livejournal.com</a> blog in collaboration with the author of this blog.</font> <br><br><h1>  <font color="red">Attention!</font> </h1><br>  This material was prepared by <a href="http://geektimes.ru/users/matt_uza/" class="user_link">Matt_uza</a> , but asked to lay me out, as it suffers from the negativity of karma.  If you want to continue, you can try to cure the user.
