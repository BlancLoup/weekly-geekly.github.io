      In the world of tweets and webinars, real IT professionals can still find inspiration in books.  We present to your attention 5 books that are worth reading by a real IT guru, according to Network World. <br><br>  When it comes to the professional development of an IT guru, books are the last thing to think about.  First, all kinds of forums, blogs, social networks come to mind. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a>  ‚ÄúI get most of the useful information on the Internet by browsing the Twitter headlines or blog posts,‚Äù confirms Dag Ross, director of information technology at Western &amp; Southern Financial Group (Cincinnati). <br><br>  Nevertheless, IT gurus cannot do without books either, the newspaper notes.  Network World asked 5 IT industry professionals to select books that influenced their successful career. <br><br>  <b>1. "The secrets of the success of Santa Claus" (Eric Harvey, David Cotrell and others).</b> <br>  ( <a href="http://www.amazon.com/The-Leadership-Secrets-Santa-Claus/dp/1885228619/ref%3Dsr_1_fkmr0_1%3Fie%3DUTF8%26qid%3D1355997051%26sr%3D8-1-fkmr0%26keywords%3D%25C2%25ABThe%2BLeadership%2BSecrets%2Bof%2BSanta%2BClaus%25C2%25BB">"The Leadership Secrets of Santa Claus", Eric Harvey, David Cottrell, Al Lucia and Mike Hourigan</a> ) <br><br>  <u>Says Warren Manufacturing Technology Director George Lassine.</u> <br><br>  There are a few points that attracted me to this book.  First of all, she came to me by mail (I still do not know who sent her and why) at the very moment when I took my first management position.  I did not have direct subordinates, but I coordinated the activities of several contractors.  I immediately read this book and made one very important advice for myself: it is necessary to surround myself with real professionals. <br><br>  In addition, the book is really interesting written.  Before that, I had read several books on leadership development, but, unlike these books, ‚ÄúThe Secrets of Santa‚Äù carried a very simple message: ‚ÄúTo be a manager is just that, don't be afraid of it.‚Äù <br><br>  <b>2. "Peter's principle: Why everything always goes awry" (Laurence Peter and Raymond Hull)</b> <br>  ( <a href="http://www.amazon.com/The-Peter-Principle-Things-Always/dp/0062092065/ref%3Dsr_1_fkmr0_1%3Fs%3Dbooks%26ie%3DUTF8%26qid%3D1355997088%26sr%3D1-1-fkmr0%26keywords%3D%25C2%25ABThe%2BPeter%2BPrinciple%253A%2BWhy%2BThings%2BAlways%2BGo%2BWrong%25C2%25BB">"The Peter Principle: Why Things Always Go Wrong", Laurence Peter and Raymond Hull</a> ) <br><br>  <u>Donald Roper, System Administrator, Greenville, California</u> <br><br>  This book seemed interesting to me, since one of its main principles is: ‚ÄúIf you are not a very competent employee, you will never build a career.  And if you are really competent, then you risk losing your job - management will see a threat in you.  The most interesting thing is that I observed this situation in practice in my company. <br><br>  <b>3. "11 secrets of influential IT gurus" (Mark J. Schiller)</b> <br>  ( <a href="http://www.amazon.com/The-Secrets-Highly-Influential-Leaders/dp/0615436285/ref%3Dsr_1_fkmr0_1%3Fs%3Dbooks%26ie%3DUTF8%26qid%3D1355997278%26sr%3D1-1-fkmr0%26keywords%3D%25C2%25ABThe%2B11%2BSecrets%2Bof%2BHighly%2BInfluential%2BIT%2BLeaders%25C2%25BB">"The 11 Secrets of Highly Influential IT Leaders", Marc J. Schiller</a> ) <br><br>  <u>Jessica Carroll, Managing Director of Information and Digital Technologies, US Golf Association</u> <br><br>  After reading this book, I grew up professionally.  I have been building an IT partnership with an association for a very long time and have found for myself in this book some very correct and realistic cases that I later managed to put into practice.  For example, I learned that an IT professional should understand very well how all business processes in a company work. <br><br>  <b>4. ‚ÄúFrom good to great‚Äù (Jim Collins)</b> <br>  ( <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Good-Great-CD-James-Collins/dp/185686863X">"Good to Great", Jim Collins</a> ) <br><br>  <u>Says Doug Ross, Director of Information Technology at Western &amp; Southern Financial Group (Cincinnati)</u> <br><br>  The main message of this book is to focus not only on your own success, but also on the success of the entire business.  To illustrate this statement, the author cites the example of a real-life situation, for example, the story of Vice Admiral James Stockdale, who survived a Vietnamese captivity. <br><br>  5. "StrengthsFinder 2.0" (Tom Rath) <br>  ( <a href="http://www.amazon.com/StrengthsFinder-2-0-Tom-Rath/dp/159562015X">"StrengthsFinder 2.0", Tom Rath</a> ) <br><br>  <u>Says Casey Biddle, State Farm Technical Analyst</u> <br><br>  I did not read many career counseling books, but this little book was the last one I read.  I also recommend Dale Carnegie‚Äôs books to everyone.  They bring you back to life, charge you with a positive that you will not get in the office or at work. <habracut></habracut></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/163323/">https://habr.com/ru/post/163323/</a></p>
