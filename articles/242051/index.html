  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Review of the DVR Mio MiVue 568 with touch screen and GPS-receiver</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"> The boom of the appearance of car DVR came a few years ago.  During this time, they have gone all the way from devices capable of recording video in a very mediocre quality to full-fledged Full HD devices.  At the same time, models with the function of notification of stationary speed cameras, GPS receiver, touch screen appeared.  Today I want to talk about the DVR Mio MiVue 568, combining all these functions. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/061/2df/4a9/0612df4a9a5740f39149b0e65cecfb2f.jpg"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  The DVR is packed in a medium sized cardboard box. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/27f/c79/738/27fc79738e9d4489a50acec4a60a1d06.jpg"><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/496/51d/dbb/49651ddbbc804f5390144378b75c8aad.jpg"><br><br>  On the back of the box, the manufacturer lists the list of the main features of the device: <br>  ‚Ä¢ Full HD 1080p video; <br>  ‚Ä¢ recording by shock sensor; <br>  ‚Ä¢ touch screen; <br>  ‚Ä¢ GPS - receiver; <br>  ‚Ä¢ adjustment of the exposure level; <br>  ‚Ä¢ recording by motion sensor. <br><br>  Inside the box are: <br>  ‚Ä¢ car DVR Mio MiVue 568; <br>  ‚Ä¢ mount on the glass of the car; <br>  ‚Ä¢ car charger with an output voltage of 5 V and a current of 1 A; <br>  ‚Ä¢ CD with documentation and software; <br>  ‚Ä¢ A cloth cover for storing and carrying the DVR.

      Unfortunately, there is no mini USB (yes, it is mini USB) or a mini HDMI cable in the DVR bundle.  If the lack of a second cable can still be reconciled, then in the absence of a card reader for micro SD memory cards, you can face the problem of transferring files with recordings to a computer.  Available home cables are likely to turn out to be micro USB, and you will need to put some effort into solving this problem. <br><br>  The dimensions of the recorder are 64.6 x 62.83 x 36.5 mm, with a mass of 95 grams.  The body is made of black plastic, quite pleasant to the touch.  Ideal clearances and fitting details allow us to speak about the high quality of manufacturing and assembly of the DVR. <br><br>  The back side of the device is almost completely occupied by a 2.5 ‚Äùtouchscreen display.  Here is the LED status indicator of the device. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/2dc/bca/cd0/2dcbcacd07a148e08b9ef5a1d2d11c8b.jpg"><br><br>  The manufacturer provides various light indications.  In my opinion, this is implemented very conveniently.  Without any problems, you can determine whether the recording is currently being performed, even when the screen is off, just by looking at the indicator. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/c1a/9ae/355/c1a9ae35555b439eba3d8b3af1c8361b.jpg"><br><br>  Control of the recorder is completely through the sensor.  The first of the two mechanical buttons, located on the right side, and is responsible for turning on / off the device.  Below is a slot for installing micro SD memory cards.  MiVue 568 supports work with memory cards up to 32 GB.  The manufacturer recommends cards of grade 6 and above. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/345/b9e/fe4/345b9efe443c4a709ff7b694748cb3ca.jpg"><br><br>  A short press on the power button while the recorder is running turns on or off the display. <br><br>  On the left side are mini USB connectors, mini HDMI and a mechanical reset button.  The connectors are not covered with rubber caps or plugs.  Therefore, the supplied storage bag made of cloth will be very useful. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/8c0/fad/419/8c0fad41963e4e1aa34dfc999e89537d.jpg"><br><br>  The front is a lens with a viewing angle of 130 degrees and aperture f / 1.8.  The optical scheme of the lens consists of six glass lenses and one infrared filter.  Additionally, you can purchase a polarizing filter. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/061/2df/4a9/0612df4a9a5740f39149b0e65cecfb2f.jpg"><br><br>  Below the lens is a speaker and an LED indicator indicating that the DVR is in parking mode. <br>  The microphone is located on the bottom of the DVR housing. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/d47/47e/8ab/d4747e8abe6f467ea7b196069dece997.jpg"><br><br>  Additionally, the layout of the controls can be found in this diagram. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/f7b/967/977/f7b967977f034f22b52be65096430e9e.jpg"><br><br>  As befits the best place to install this type of DVR - car windshield.  Installation is performed using plastic suction mount.  The mount is based on a ball joint, so that the user can rotate the device as he pleases. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/055/ea6/049/055ea6049dd340fb9392e8c9c4da3ef4.jpg"><br><br>  The location of the mini USB connector, through which the power is supplied, is oriented in such a way that the "G" -shaped cord is directed to the ceiling.  For those users who run the cable under the cabin trim, this is a definite plus. <br><br>  When you turn on the device, in a female voice, the greeting is played back with thanks for using the Mio DVR.  At this moment, a text warning about the danger of working with the device while controlling the vehicle is displayed on the recorder screen.  Both greetings are played each time the DVR is turned on, without the ability to turn them off in the settings. <br><br>  I got the Mio MiVue 568 with firmware VL00.0A.B2FR1.  At the moment, on <a href="http://service.mio.com/M0100/MainFrame.aspx">the manufacturer's website</a> there is firmware VL00.0B.F2.FR1.  New firmware somewhat changes the location of menu items and icons on the screen relative to the old firmware, increasing the usability.  Further description of the DVR, I will produce based on the latest firmware VL00.0B.F2.FR1 <br><br>  The recorder menu contains four items: ‚ÄúView files‚Äù, ‚ÄúEnable parking mode‚Äù, ‚ÄúRecord sound‚Äù and ‚ÄúSettings‚Äù. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/0bc/591/795/0bc591795c7945dba50f47c12c26f5f6.jpg"><br><br>  The menu item "View files" provides access to the contents of the memory card, which is divided into four categories: "Video", "G-sensor", "Parking" and "Photo".  Files are structured by date in a list.  At the same time on the screen displays no more than three file names.  Below is the free and maximum available size for the folder.  The available volume for each category of files is set through the menu ‚ÄúSettings‚Äù -&gt; ‚ÄúSystem‚Äù -&gt; ‚ÄúMemory allocation‚Äù.  Here the user has the right to choose the acceptable limits based on the size of the installed memory card. <br><br>  The menu item "Turn on parking mode" enables or disables parking mode.  Setting the mode is made through the menu ‚ÄúSettings‚Äù -&gt; ‚ÄúParking mode‚Äù. <br><br>  The menu item "Sound recording" provides access to enable or disable the microphone. <br><br>  The menu item "Settings" contains sub-items: <br>  ‚Ä¢ ‚ÄúCamera base‚Äù - contains settings for sound alert, distance of alert, choice of warning option for speed or speed limit, limit on speeding from 10 to 60 km / h, user base for cameras and setting of speed alert; <br>  ‚Ä¢ ‚ÄúParking mode‚Äù - contains settings for the motion sensor, G-sensor, motion detector and LED indicator on the front side of the recorder; <br>  ‚Ä¢ ‚ÄúVideo recording‚Äù - sets the duration of the recording fragment, the exposure correction from -1 to +1 in 1/3 increments, HDR mode and setting the display of GPS coordinates. <br>  ‚Ä¢ ‚ÄúSensitivity for acceleration‚Äù - setting the sensitivity of the G-sensor and the parking sensor to automatically start an accident recording or switch to parking mode. <br>  ‚Ä¢ ‚ÄúSystem‚Äù - displays GPS reception status, set date and time, audible depression indication, volume, screen duration, language selection, unit selection, memory allocation, reset to factory settings, and view firmware version. <br>  ‚Ä¢ "Format" - formats the installed memory card. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/349/f7d/4b9/349f7d4b99dd4e5e940b2a5718aef5bd.jpg"><br><br>  When the power cable is connected, the Mio MiVue 568 will turn on automatically.  After playing the greetings, the video and the search for GPS satellites automatically turn on.  The search time for satellites is less than one minute after switching on the recorder. <br><br>  A 240 mAh battery is built into the DVR housing.  Of course, talking about any long battery life is not necessary.  But, for example, it allows saving the video at a critical moment from a sudden power outage.  The battery also allows you to use the parking mode when recording occurs by a motion sensor and the screen is off. <br><br>  On a fully charged internal battery, the recording time, with the screen on, is about 8 minutes. <br><br>  This DVR uses a 3 megapixel matrix.  Video is recorded in Full HD 1080p / 30k / s.  Use single .MOV file format for recording. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/d46/04c/808/d4604c808b334873b2cfe45579d90c34.jpg"><br><br>  In addition to video recorder, you can use it to take photos.  Implemented it is very convenient.  To get a photo, just click on the corresponding icon on the touch screen.  Moreover, this function is available even at the time of video recording and you do not have to look for the right moment at home in the player to get a freeze-frame of the events from there. <br><br>  In the same way, you can add a camera to the user‚Äôs camera base.  To add a camera, GPS is required.  After that, the new camera is displayed in the camera database by geographic coordinates with the date and time of addition. <br><br>  The firmware VL00.0B.F2.FR1 updated by me from September 30, 2014 includes the V57_0613 camera base.  Today, the V69_1013 camera base dated October 13, 2014 is available on the manufacturer's website.  It is very pleasant to constantly update the bases of stationary cameras. <br><br>  Updating the firmware or camera base performs by copying the file with the update to the root of the memory card.  After that, when the DVR is first turned on, the update procedure will be launched.  Upon its completion, the DVR will automatically turn off. <br><br>  Another pleasant opportunity when working with a DVR is the presence of the program MiVue Manager. <br><br>  The program allows you to view videos with reference to GPS coordinates, G-sensor readings, track of the traversed path on Google map.  You can sort videos by accident record, normal or parking mode and sort by date based on the calendar.  In addition, it is possible to create a backup copy of the recording, take a screenshot from the video recording, export geographic data to KML, upload the video to YouTube or Facebook. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/a17/f49/ca8/a17f49ca8df547328b492e6e54d0ebc3.jpg"><br><br>  To compare the resulting image, I used the KARKAM Q4 Lite DVR I acquired two years ago. <br>  You can estimate the difference in overall dimensions from the following photo: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/047/6e0/365/0476e0365f7143ff9ec1aa87c287ed4f.jpg"><br><br>  Sunny Day - Record 1: <br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/hIFWuANkmOw%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700021,15700186,15700191,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhjR6PkHQBDSUUohfPkiFq2ufD-4kQ" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/s2UaWbyaiz4%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700021,15700186,15700191,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhg8f80bB42yyYxencH7eI4yO9t65w" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  Sunny Day - Record 2: <br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/ffxkl4JyL8o%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700021,15700186,15700191,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhhO6HyNWH463WOs9jF7JXK0ZMxctg" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/R8TBJuVNbDU%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700021,15700186,15700191,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhh4r3yDX3B1SeYmJO-YpujebQuyrw" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  During the moments when the sun is in the frame, the sky is almost completely knocked out using the Q4 Lite CARDS.  DVR Mio MiVue 568 copes with this much better.  In addition, the overall contrast of the picture is much higher, even without using a polarizing filter. <br><br>  With regards to detail, the identification numbers of passing and oncoming cars is possible in a much larger percentage of cases, when using the Mio MiVue 568. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/91a/e84/621/91ae846219b84612b0ce066b6d031289.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/6f0/56f/45d/6f056f45d37e4633838cc00db250f590.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/d2e/de0/495/d2ede04955db45afae594eea4e716a4c.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/310/735/4f4/3107354f44f8477a90a8f26238ea63fe.jpg"><br><br>  Night - Record 1: <br>  Shooting was made on a well-lit city street. <br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/6a91dVxoCws%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700021,15700186,15700191,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhitM9zJ5KS19TiSI38TBHhQVOTQNA" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/KHgsH5pxAqE%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700021,15700186,15700191,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhgtUsr6_HFYV-2z2PdZDWQZwNSWVQ" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  One of the problems of night recording is the flare of the room in front of the traveling car.  CARE Q4 Lite fully illuminates the room, and disassemble it is absolutely not possible.  The Mio MiVue 568 is much better with this.  The numbers of cars located in the center of the frame are read quite clearly.  Although the number of parked cars, or traveling in the adjacent rows, numbers are no longer readable. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/064/8e8/cd4/0648e8cd41b34646b15596a30425f72e.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/962/8c3/4cf/9628c34cf7584439afa1325f3248a5dc.jpg"><br>  Night - Record 2: <br><br>  Shooting was made on the track without external lighting.  From 8 to 11 seconds high beam was turned on. <br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/ECq2oaGXaBA%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700021,15700186,15700191,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhiAiltpaw0nUHBZf-4fEwPJ2JZz0A" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/ZP6BjYf7QkI%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700021,15700186,15700191,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhjEqWoIiCdZ-DhBZtNC-Cugrrd0Ew" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br>  The quality of the night recording of the Mio MiVue 568 is significantly higher than that of the Q4 Lite CARDS. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/b5e/d7e/772/b5ed7e77254144239cfe30f8b2e5c488.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/de9/055/9b0/de90559b08e94096b226f0d139bf58cb.jpg"><br><br>  Conclusion: <br><br>  DVR Mio MiVue 568 is a very interesting model.  Using the touch screen, GPS receiver and the implementation of the functional for warning of fixed cameras and the ability to add cameras manually makes the device unlike many other DVRs. <br><br>  Quick access to emergency recording or parking modes, as well as the instant creation of a snapshot or the addition of a camera to the user database, allows you to not miss any important point. <br><br>  Intuitively simple control through the touch screen and not overloaded with various settings menu allow you to master the device, without any difficulties from the user. <br><br>  Currently, the cost of the DVR Mio MiVue 568 is about 6500 rubles.  And if you have decided to change the registrar acquired a couple of years to a more modern model, then why not do this?  Mio MiVue 568 is a great choice. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/242051/">https://habr.com/ru/post/242051/</a></p>
