And that such an idea - the first site writing about a really made in Russia - it will find its audience.  So it happened. <br><br>  During the year a strong community appeared on the site.  The first months I had to look for news myself, add to the site, write reviews.  Now this is done by site users.  Attendance has grown to 6000 people a day, and continues to grow by about 30% per month.  On a weekday, up to 30-40 new entries appear on the site, most of them about what has already been done.

      But our main achievement, probably, was the answer to the question, and how many industries are opening in Russia. <a name="habracut"></a>  Well, for many people who are reading me now, the answer is clear - not one, but the barrels of plant-breaking plants are barbarously destroyed every day.  But this is not the case; in one summer we collected information about the opening of more than one hundred new industries.  And this is only what was found.  Yes, they are different, they are small shops costing hundreds of millions, they are huge production at the cost of one and a half billion dollars.  In total on a site for a year data <a href="http://sdelanounas.ru/blogs/8285/">on more than 300 open productions for this year</a> are collected  This is among other things jobs, taxes. <br><br>  By the way, this was a problem, because the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãthe site is not what has been done, but what has already been done or is being done.  But people, inspired by the success, carried on the site not only real things, but also plans for the future.  At first it was necessary to persuade, they say, better quality than quantity.  But not much work.  It was necessary to solve the issue technically, firstly, in the main tape, only popular posts are shown that users have missed, and secondly, there are separate blogs ‚Äú <a href="http://sdelanounas.ru/blogs/%3Fid%3D100">It will be done with us</a> ‚Äù and ‚Äú <a href="http://sdelanounas.ru/blogs/%3Fid%3D105">A contract has been signed ...</a> ‚Äù.  These blogs are offtopic, and entries in them are visible only to subscribers.  Visitors to the site do not see such records in the total feed.  Thus, the quality of the material was able to raise. <br><br>  Not only the production news appeared on the site, Marina Tumanova maintains a wonderful blog, <a href="http://sdelanounas.ru/blogs/%3Fid%3D89">it is dedicated to the cities of Russia</a> .  It turned out that many cities here are very beautiful, and lately they have only become more beautiful.  Also, the site collects information about new <a href="http://sdelanounas.ru/blogs/%3Fid%3D101">schools, kindergartens</a> , <a href="http://sdelanounas.ru/blogs/%3Fid%3D104">hospitals</a> .  This is also very much being built.  The <a href="http://sdelanounas.ru/blogs/3293/">number of constructed and under construction medical centers was</a> especially striking, many of them are already working.  Particularly pleased with the construction of perinatal centers, last year they were handed over EMNIP 18 pieces, this plan is also about this number.  Sports complexes are also built a lot, for the last year <a href="http://sdelanounas.ru/blogs/3877/">about 180 pieces were opened</a> . <br><br>  Such structures as Rosatom, Rosnano, Russian Railways also paid attention to the site.  They started inviting me to press tours, exhibitions, presentations.  I had already managed to <a href="http://www.sdelanounas.ru/blogs/5843/">visit Izhevsk</a> at the opening of another plant built with the support of Rosnano, I <a href="http://www.sdelanounas.ru/blogs/7293/">was in Dimitrovgrad in NIIAR</a> , where we started production of a new isotope - molybdenum-99, which is used in medicine. Lebedeva.  Oh yeah, I forgot, one of the few managed to <a href="http://sdelanounas.ru/blogs/7444/">test the ‚ÄúChubais Tablet‚Äù</a> .  By the way, he made a very good impression on me.  Tablet, not Chubais, of course :) <br><br>  The press also drew attention, recently published <a href="http://www.aif.ru/techno/article/46292">an article with my interview in AiF</a> .  I was also invited to the People‚Äôs Radio. <br><br>  The original VDS has already ceased to keep the load, especially in the peaks, so I had to rent a server.  Now the project is working on a server with a good start, quad core, 8 gigs of RAM.  Should be enough for a long time. <br><br>  Gradually, the manufacturers themselves come to the site, and there are already several corporate blogs that are maintained by the companies themselves.  Some companies just write to the sites in general blogs, many send me news by mail. <br><br>  Another achievement of the site was a <a href="http://sdelanounas.ru/catalog/2/">rather extensive catalog of manufacturers of consumer goods in Russia</a> , clothes, shoes, cosmetics and other things that we see in stores.  Unfortunately, retail chains prefer China, but if you know the names, you can find our products.  They are, by the way, of quite good quality, I now probably have half of our clothes made in Russia, Bask, Gloria Jinz, Polar, RalphRinger and others. <br><br>  I will immediately answer the question about the monetization of the resource, namely, how many shekels are paid to me by a bloodworm.  Sorry - not how much.  The site is generally apolitical as much as possible, we do not glorify anyone, we just state the facts: the plant is open, the farm is built, a bridge is put in, and so on ... We can draw conclusions already to the visitors.  So I don‚Äôt have a relationship in United Russia, I don‚Äôt have a relationship with Ours, and the site is <a href="http://sdelanounas.ru/staticpages/%3Fid%3D111">fully supported by user donations</a> .  Moreover, I personally do not support EdRo, I am not going to vote for them, and I think that this party has nothing to do with what is written on the site.  The site does not bring fabulous revenues, and the project for this has not been conceived, but it pays for itself completely, and even brings profit, which, by the way, is still fully invested in resource development, for example, in design, layout, some optional, but useful, expenses, such as registration in the media or server upgrade.  Some time on the site hung contextual advertising, but I removed it - not solid, but money, thanks to donations, is still enough. <br><br>  In general, skeptics predictions were not justified, there is something to write about, and there is someone to write to.  The site is developing, and people give me many thanks for it.  The idea was a success!  And the site performs the function for which he thought to fulfill - reminds us all that all the same, despite the problems and difficulties that certainly exist in Russia, all the same, friends, we have something to be proud of! </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/130615/">https://habr.com/ru/post/130615/</a></p>
