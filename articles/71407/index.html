But looking at the puddles, the wind and rain outside the window five days a week, he doubted that it was suitable for everyone. <br><br>  Therefore, I want to talk about push-ups, than they are better, from my point of view, well-known standard physical exercises (pull-ups, squats), to create physical activity during the day. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Immediately make a reservation that I am not an expert and all of the following is my personal experience and views.

    <h2>  Initial data </h2><br>  8-10 hours at the computer, lack of desire to go somewhere to the gym due to the remoteness of reasonable prices (in an hour's drive - a total of two hours one way in both directions) and the high cost of the subscription being nearby. <br><br><h2>  Task </h2><br>  Provide physical exertion during the day with the least time and moral effort on oneself, a quick effect - a feeling of muscle tension. <br><br><h3>  Solution - Pushups </h3><br>  Pushups - one of the most famous exercises, along with squats and pull-ups.  However, in comparison with their ‚Äúcolleagues‚Äù, in my opinion, it has a number of indisputable advantages.  Namely: <br><ul><li>  Push-ups do not require any equipment except a clean floor and comfortable clothes.  The same pull-ups require a horizontal bar.  This means that push-ups can be done almost anywhere - for example, I do this even in the office (in an empty conference room :)) </li><li>  Pushups allow you to load an amazing amount of muscle.  There are numerous examples of this on YouTube (for example, <a title="example of various pushups" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3DX72LtRcXR6g">here</a> ).  In particular, while maintaining the correct body position, the press works, and the push-ups thereby inflate the press.  I personally do 30-50 with a wide position of hands, and then 10-20 on fists with a close position of the elbows of the body - one can say ‚Äúnarrow grip‚Äù, and plus 20 each with lifting one leg ‚Äî loads the legs very well. </li><li>  Push-ups immediately give the feeling that the muscles are working.  Unlike squats, you can sit 100 times and not get tired; after all, we work with our feet more in life (at least we walk) than with our hands.  Here you can say that squatting on one leg or jumping too quickly get tired - but the whole push-up trick is that for a greater load you don‚Äôt need to be distorted (for example, squatting, standing on your toes - how we were trained at the dance), but you just have to change hand and / or foot positions.  And here - the speed.  With a good load of 5 minutes of push-ups 3-5 times with a break per minute, stress is very good.  Generally - looking up from the computer, I pause for 20 pushups! </li><li>  Pushups are very affordable.  For people who have extra weight, it is usually problematic to pull themselves together and it is psychologically difficult - 3-5 times and no longer pulls to try again.  And push-ups easier, you only need to choose the position of the hands. </li><li>  Push-ups are less traumatic.  Also an important factor.  The same squats are fraught with various injuries of the knee when overdoing - although this can be attributed to common bikes. </li></ul><br><br><h3>  Details of equipment </h3><br>  Technique lit enough in detail on the Internet.  For example, push-ups are well described <a href="http://www.menshealth.com.ua/kompl_upr/5625.html">here</a> and <a href="http://www.steelfactor.ru/trening/162.html">here</a> . <br><br><h3>  What's next </h3><br>  After push-ups, you can already buy dumbbells and perform exercises with them.  Or maybe do something more serious.  In my opinion, push-ups are well suited to start! <br><br>  Give us more healthy and physically strong IT specialists! <br><br>  I would be glad if the article helped someone to start. <br><br>  <b>UPD:</b> Once you feel the taste - you can already add squats, and other exercises for the load of all muscle groups.  Also shown are aerobic exercise ‚Äî the same run, swimming, and bicycle ‚Äî for all-round development.  In the article I just wanted to encourage you to start practicing and feel the thrill of exercise - because the first step is so important, isn't it? <br><br>  Thanks to all who have commented, especially <a href="http://geektimes.ru/users/meglio/" class="user_link">meglio</a> , who came up with an addition to the article. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/71407/">https://habr.com/ru/post/71407/</a></p>
