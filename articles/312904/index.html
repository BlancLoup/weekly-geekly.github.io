      In the first season, Sola is named Jimmy McGill (Sol Goodman is a pseudonym), and he is just starting his lawyer career.  Prior to obtaining a lawyer‚Äôs license, Jimmy worked in the postal department at his brother‚Äôs law firm, where he studied law at night and, eventually, successfully passed the necessary exams. <br><br>  <b>True marketing</b> <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/-Zy4F-9nq2o" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  At first, Jimmy went to court as a public defender, but because  they paid very little there, and Jimmy wanted more money, he decided to take up private practice.  Having received a significant amount of money for one not very legal operation, he decided to give an advertisement and it was here that he made the first serious mistake. <br><br>  On a huge billboard, he posted his photo, completely copying the image of the owner of the law firm where he worked in the postal department, with a logo, one-on-one copying the logo of this company except for the letters on it.  James M. McGill instead of Hamlin, Hamlin and McGill (HHM).  He made his image as close as possible to the image of the owner of HHM, for which he bought a very expensive suit, accessories and made an expensive hairstyle. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/d3c/eae/78d/d3ceae78d21f7454faa929ec3229d0dc.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  It is clear why Jimmy decided to copy the image and logo of a well-known law firm - he wanted to take advantage of the reputation of an already well-known brand and get clients who are not very good at it.  Of course, the owner of HHM was forced to sue and, of course, the judge decided to dismantle this billboard. <br><br>  And here Jimmy made the second mistake.  Deciding that it is better to squeeze the most out of the situation, he resorted to an extraordinary move.  First, Jimmy agreed to shoot a news clip dedicated to this situation, just during the dismantling works.  And when the assembler ‚Äúunexpectedly‚Äù left the structure and hung on it, Jimmy bravely rushed to save him.  Of course, the camera filmed all this and, thus, Jimmy received free airtime on the news, as well as the honor and respect of thousands of his fellow countrymen. <br><br>  By attracting serious attention to his person, Jimmy began to receive dozens of calls, however, as it turned out later, he was able to provide only services for drawing up several wills for very little money.  All other callers turned out to be useless from the business point of view, customers, and our main character lost a lot of time and nerves, figuring this out. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/6f4/408/056/6f4408056fb914d3922e9b3090d08f03.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Jimmy‚Äôs mistake was not that he decided to draw attention to himself in such an extraordinary way, but that he ‚Äúhit‚Äù a too wide audience, attracting, in the first place, not quite adequate characters. <br><br>  But now, having suffered with all these clients and realizing that he will not make a career as a successful lawyer, Jimmy suddenly realizes that he is good at working with retirees and making testaments to them.  And this is where our character begins to do everything right. <br><br>  <b>Bingo!</b>  <b>Need a will?</b>  <b>Call McGill!</b> <br><br>  Having decided on his target audience, Jimmy began to think about where she was represented most of all, and went to offer his services there.  For this purpose, he chose a bingo game club (an analogue of our lotto), where mostly retired people gather and become the leader of the game in order to gain the trust and loyalty of their future customers.  He also printed and distributed to all participating in the game cards with numbers, where at the bottom was written large ‚ÄúNeed a will?  Call McGill! ‚Äù(Need a will? Call McGill), and on the sides was his phone number. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/a8b/45f/819/a8b45f819d0f05f480333c8077a62da8.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Thus, Jimmy unobtrusively advertised his services to his target audience exactly where this audience had the most, and where it organically perceived its advertising. <br><br>  <b>Perfect marketing</b> <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/pcjYhFsV7fc" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  In the second season, he again showed his marketer abilities when he needed to figure out how to get to his potential clients in a special private pension, where he was not allowed to go in person.  Jimmy knew that all retired people living there would be watching TV at certain times to watch their favorite show.  And he decided to give a spot advertisement on the channel that they are watching, precisely at the time when this series is on. <br><br>  Moreover, Jimmy did the advertising for a reason, and he used the most simple and understandable image for pensioners, removing one of his first clients in the video, for which he was making a will.  There was nothing superfluous in the video - only an elderly woman with sad eyes and voice-over, but the video produced exactly the impression that was needed.  Minutes after the release of advertising to the law firm Jimmy, a hail of calls began to fall, which meant the tremendous success of this small but very effective advertising campaign. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/e65/d6a/a71/e65d6aa71945204eb07b257a4ab8e65e.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  <b>In fact, all Jimmy did to get customers was:</b> <br><br>  1. Decided on who his target audience is. <br>  2. Identified places where it happens most often. <br>  3. Sent her a clear advertising message that falls in her values ‚Äã‚Äãand needs. <br><br>  In fact, if every business owner or marketer observed these simple rules, we would probably live in a completely different world, so it's always nice to see such simple and elegant marketing solutions in TV shows. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/312904/">https://habr.com/ru/post/312904/</a></p>
