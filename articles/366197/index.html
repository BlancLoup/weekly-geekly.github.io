You can save money in different ways, for example, it is just rarely to turn on the light and go to bed at 18.00.  But the pleasure of such savings quite a bit, in general, there are other, less sacrificial ways. <br><br>  For example - installing energy-efficient equipment, including smart LED bulbs.  Previously, such devices (and this is a full-fledged device, and not just a source of light) were expensive, but now the market can offer much less expensive solutions.  However, these bulbs can be very functional.  And below, under the cut - a review of five smart LED bulbs, plus, as a bonus - a description of a smart cartridge for any lamp. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  We decided to rank the bulbs for the price - from the most budget solutions to the more expensive ones.  And do not think that the functionality of a smart lamp in low-cost solutions is trimmed - this is not quite true.

    <h3>  Luminous BT Smart Bulb </h3><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/c52/905/ce1/c52905ce1304099f1ee46108e0130d67.jpg"><br><br>  Surprisingly, the cheapest lamp in the selection is perhaps the most extensive functionality.  What can the lamp?  Much: <br><ul><li>  Control from a smartphone via Bluetooth; </li><li>  Ability to set color and brightness; </li><li>  Formation of a system of several lamps installed in different places; </li><li>  The ability to synchronize the luminosity of the lamp and music played from a smartphone (a trifle, but nice). </li></ul><br><br>  At the same time, the range of the radio signal from a smartphone is about 40 meters, so you can control the lamps in any apartment from anywhere. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/MGiLnvRWzlw%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700022,15700186,15700190,15700248,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhgV3A23j4m3EZ-az1QAiFuRenwazA" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  Applications for the lamp is both under the Android OS, and under iOS.  The application, in addition to the above functions, also allows programming the lamp on and off times.  You can set the power off to a gradual dimming of the light, and the power up to a gradual increase in brightness. <br><br>  The application settings for the Luminous BT Smart Bulb include 20 built-in subroutines.  Each of the subroutines has 31 modes from the slowest (‚Äú1‚Äù) to the fastest (‚Äú31‚Äù).  Plus two dozen modes that control colors. <br><br>  Learn more about the functions of the bulb can be in the <a href="">instructions for it</a> .  In addition, we have already dismantled this light bulb, and the corresponding post is <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/medgadgets/blog/236947/">placed on Habr√©</a> . <br><br>  Lamp power: 12 W (analog of 75 W of the glow lamp) <br><br>  The price of Luminous BT Smart Bulb is quite affordable, and <a href="http://medgadgets.ru/shop/svetodiodnye-lampy-luminous.html">is 1990 rubles</a> .  It is safe to say that this is a combination of price / quality, close to the ideal. <br><br><h3>  Insteon LED Bulb </h3><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/3d9/ee9/846/3d9ee9846f61efb8d016ff5e7f3ed44b.jpg"><br><br>  This light is also quite good: you can change the brightness level, turn the light on and off, combine individual lamps into a single system.  The control is performed either from a special remote control or from a smartphone running iOS / Android OS. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/AGUtDUU_2_w%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700022,15700186,15700190,15700248,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhgfm3RYkkzyhQhPqeMvnurXRPS8Ag" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  The user can adjust the gradual extinction of the lamp, if necessary.  When turned on, the lamp maintains the luminosity level, which was when the lamp was turned off (provided, of course, that the luminosity level was not zero). <br><br>  The color of this lamp does not know how to change, but the service life is 52 thousand hours. <br><br>  Lamp power: 8 W (60 watt analog incandescent). <br><br>  The price of Insteon LED Bulb is slightly higher than in the previous version: 2459 rubles. <br><br><h3>  Drift </h3><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/258/135/61d/25813561da38e0997da1814ba94eb130.jpg"><br><br>  There are not so many functions here, but it is very simple to control the lamp: to set one of the three modes, you need to press the usual switch one, two or three times. <br><br>  One time is to turn the lamp on and off. <br><br>  Twice - the night light mode is set.  In this mode, the lamp consumes very little energy, shines weakly, so that a couple of light bulbs can be left in this mode for the night to navigate in the apartment, if you want to drink at night or to the toilet. <br><br>  Three times - the light gradually dies away, turning off in 37 minutes. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/adZKSNhzU5w%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700022,15700186,15700190,15700248,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhjuCxtERBG2Mxc6jdohyZcIuHGbRg" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  The manufacturer claims that such a gradual extinction models the sunset.  Accordingly, if you go to bed and turn on the ‚Äúsunset‚Äù mode, the human body more organically switches to sleep mode than in the case of an instantaneous transition from day to night. <br><br>  Lamp power: 7 W (40 watt analog incandescent). <br><br>  The price of LED lamp Drift <a href="http://medgadgets.ru/shop/drift-light.html">is 2900 rubles</a> . <br><br><h3>  LIFX </h3><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/b7f/018/646/b7f0186460cd149213cbd5280c1f71c5.jpg" width="750"><br><br>  Quite a functional solution.  The lamp has a Wi-Fi module, and you can control the lamp remotely from your smartphone or tablet (both iOS and Android OS are supported).  According to the developers, such a lamp can work without problems for 25 years (!). <br><br>  With the help of a special application, you can adjust the lamp brightness, color and mode of operation.  So, you can configure LIFX to change the brightness and color during the day, depending on time.  You can turn on the mode of automatically turning on or off the light source when a person enters or leaves the premises. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/cRaPQDzkJcQ%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700022,15700186,15700190,15700248,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhi-RyOzOecrzRqIP0TjjdFUzwN1Fg" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  Also, the developers have provided the possibility of creating color music - ideal for a party. <br><br>  Power: up to 17 W (60 W analog for incandescent lamp). <br><br>  The price is less affordable than in the previous versions, and is 5990 rubles, but there are more functions here. <br><br><h3>  Holi SleepCompanion </h3><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/50f/45f/1c8/50f45f1c8542e96345fc41fa5d96440f.jpg"><br><br>  This lamp is not just a light source, but also a smart alarm clock, as well as a sleep quality detector.  At bedtime, the lamp can be set to gradually turn off, with changes in brightness and color of the glow.  The lamp supports collaboration with many fitness devices, including Withings, FitBit bracelets, JawboneUP, Netatmo weather station. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/HAcCtq6jcNQ%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700022,15700186,15700190,15700248,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhiuMyDkMf99UXu0sd0pSzdUcWFkKw" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  Work with some devices can be synchronized, in addition, the lamp application receives data from fitness bracelets, allowing you to find out which mode of operation of the lighting system most beneficially affects the quality of sleep and wakefulness of the owner. <br><br>  According to the developers, the project was originally prepared for NASA, but later it was decided to transfer everything to commercial rails for everyday needs of ordinary people. <br><br>  You can control the lamp from a mobile device running Android OS or iOS.  For this lamp is equipped with a Bluetooth module. <br><br>  This is the most expensive device from the selection, the price of the lamp <a href="http://medgadgets.ru/shop/holi-sleepcompanion.html">is 7990 rubles</a> . <br><br><h3>  Smart cartridge VOCCA </h3><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/8ad/39f/1a8/8ad39f1a80deebda809c5d44312f7280.jpg"><br><br>  Finally, there is another smart device on the market now - a cartridge for VOCCA lamps, which can turn any incandescent lamp into a smart one.  The smartphone has a Bluetooth wireless module through which the remote control of the cartridge is performed. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/ALKssQpX2v4%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700022,15700186,15700190,15700248,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhjGCB2dpXnIvPQSm-WsQIhZt2f6NQ" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  Developers have released apps for both Android and iOS.  The user who installed the application will be able to turn the lamp on and off remotely.  In addition, the cartridge recognizes the sound, so that you can turn on the lamp or turn it off with a simple pop or voice command. <br><br>  The cost of the <a href="http://medgadgets.ru/shop/smart-lighting-vocca.html">Vocca</a> cartridge <a href="http://medgadgets.ru/shop/smart-lighting-vocca.html">in Russia is 3950 rubles</a> . <br><br>  PS Good news: 4% discount for GeekTimes readers by <b>Geek</b> code. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/366197/">https://habr.com/ru/post/366197/</a></p>
