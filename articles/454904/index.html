  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Samsung opens a free online course on neural networks in computer vision tasks</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  You still do not understand why ReLU is better than sigmoids, how does Rprop differ from RMSprop, why normalize signals and what is a skip connection?  Why does a neural network need a graph, and what kind of mistake did it make, that it spreads back?  Do you have a project with a computer vision, or maybe you are doing an intergalactic robot to fight dirty plates, and you want him to decide whether to launder or come off? <br><br>  We are launching the open <a href="https://stepik.org/course/50352/">course ‚ÄúNeural networks and computer vision‚Äù</a> , which is addressed to those who are taking the first steps in this area.  Course strengths: <br><br><ul><li>  the authors of the course know what they are talking about: they are engineers of the Samsung Samsung Center of Artificial Intelligence, Mikhail Romanov and Igor Slinko; </li><li>  there is a theory with puzzles, and practice on PyTorch </li><li>  proceed to practice immediately after mastering the minimum theoretical knowledge. </li><li>  The best students will be invited for an interview at Samsung Research Russia! </li></ul><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/yf/fi/nd/yffindpmtqyz-u06wclozrmf2oa.png"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  This course opened on June 1 - the first in a series of free online courses from Samsung on the Stepik platform.  The choice of the Russian platform was made in order to provide more opportunities for the Russian-speaking audience.  Courses will primarily be devoted to the field of Machine Learning (ML).  The choice is not accidental: in May 2018, the Samsung Artificial Intelligence Center Samsung opened in Moscow, where ML scientific stars such as Viktor Lempitsky (the most quoted Russian scientist in the Computer Science category), Dmitry Vetrov, Anton Konushin, and many others work.

      So, in 6 weeks of video lectures and practical tasks, doing 3-5 hours a week, you will be able to figure out how to solve basic tasks of computer vision, as well as acquire the necessary theoretical training for further independent study of the field. <br><br>  Two modes of passing the course are supposed: basic and advanced.  In the first case, it is enough to watch lectures, answer questions on lectures and solve seminars.  In the second case, it will be necessary to solve theoretical problems in which it will be necessary to apply sufficiently extensive knowledge of mathematics from 1-2 courses of a technical university. <br><br>  The course consistently sets out the terminology and principles of building neural networks, describes current tasks, optimization methods, loss functions, and basic architectures of neural networks.  And at the end of the training - the solution of the visual applied problem of computer vision. <br><br><h2>  Course instructors </h2><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/l4/wz/2b/l4wz2bchg_kvouylqi-m5gczmoq.jpeg" align="left" width="50%" height="50%">  <b>Mikhail Romanov</b> <br><br>  Graduate MIPT.
