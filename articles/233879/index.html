He loves technology just like any computer fan.  And he has a fairly decent experience and knowledge in programming, IT security and software development. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/57b/394/215/57b394215e2442c28a4dea3f78710e94.jpg"><br><br>  However, this developer from the Canadian province of New Brunswick also agitates users to disconnect from their desktop computers and switch to smart mobile devices in order to explore the world.

      It was precisely the thirst for travel that inspired Ryan to create the <a href="http://www.windowsphone.com/ru-ru/store/app/trekkit-traveller/54d14ae8-52d4-4bf9-9a81-b824bacf5e97">Trekkit Traveler</a> app, a modern interpretation of the traveler‚Äôs hiking magazine.  Today we decided to tell in more detail about this developer and his brainchild. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  However, not only the love of exploring this world has become a prerequisite for the creation of the Trekkit Traveler.  The app is a Ryan project that he worked on at <a href="https://www.appcampus.fi/appcademy/about-appcademy">AppCademy</a> , a four-week camp with a rich developer program in Finnish Espoo.  This is an AppCampus initiative, part of a 21 million euro partner program from Microsoft and Aalto University, designed to prepare and finance the efforts of developers of mobile technologies, design and usability for Windows Phone. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/b48/ec1/a56/b48ec1a56033410a8801323cde8dc0ee.jpg"><br><br>  Ryan‚Äôs special-purpose Windows Phone app called Trekkit Traveler allows travelers to geotag on a map, mark a location, add photos, videos, and even voice over, and then combine them all into one tag called trekk.  These tags can later be sent to friends and acquaintances via social networks and email. <br><br>  The key feature of Trekkit Traveler is full autonomy (independence from Internet connection) when creating "tracks".  Those.  on long journeys, where there may not be normal conditions for communication for a long time, users can create tags and then synchronize them with the site as soon as possible. <br><br>  And in the next update Trekkit Traveler, which will be available this fall, the application will be able to automatically collect all your photos and videos in a slideshow. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/25d/cc2/ea7/25dcc2ea7c7644ea9ed0a037e70d8543.png"><br><br>  Ryan's passion for travel prompted him not only to create an app, but also to record his own <a href="http://www.trekkit.com/TV">television show</a> on Canadian television, also called Trekkit.  It is noteworthy that the <a href="http://blog.trekkit.com/filming-katahdin-the-challenge">Lumia 1020 and other Lumia smartphones are</a> partially involved in the shooting of the episodes.  All series of shows can be viewed using the free <a href="http://www.windowsphone.com/ru-ru/store/app/trekkit-tv/ecf75918-ac45-49f7-9fb2-d37d96252b11">Trekkit TV</a> app. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/2Hyjxt2U4Mc%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700002,15700022,15700186,15700191,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhh-OZkv0HaeRnfeSYBIzeE12NfAbQ" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  Our colleagues were able to meet with Ryan and ask a few questions about his career, as well as his passion for development and travel. <br><br>  <b>How did you start your journey in technology?</b>  <b>Why study as a programmer?</b> <br><br>  The university seemed to me somehow boring and constraining.  I found a job in the computer field when I was 19, and from that moment it all began.  I worked in the IT department of the district education committee.  My job was to ensure the proper functioning of the computers of all 18 schools in our province. <br><br>  I had a great teacher.  He took me with him to various meetings of high-ranking employees, and we created one of the first computer networks in schools.  I worked there for four years, and it is this job that I consider to be the place where I received my bachelor's degree. <br><br>  I also wrote two programs while I worked there.  One was for teachers, and the other was a subscription management program for a local newspaper.  And both of these programs are still in use! <br><br>  <b>Tell us more about AppCampus?</b> <br><br>  One of the most valuable things that I brought out from AppCampus was the idea and the complete concept of Trekkit Traveler.  Before that, I rather was the one who thinks over the concept in the course of action.  And here I had to immediately paint everything in full: every screen, every button.  It was useful to learn. <br><br>  <b>Why did you become a developer?</b>  <b>And why did you choose the Windows Phone platform?</b> <br><br>  Application development is such a way to engage in art for people who lack artistic qualities.  I love to create, search for ideas and create things that other people use. <br><br>  I'm a kind of Windows fan.  I like how the start screen on Windows Phone is made, and how you can customize it.  I love how my Lumia works with Office 365. <br><br>  <b>Any tips you can share to encourage novice application developers?</b> <br><br>  Choose a small project.  Think what a small thing you could create.  Do not start learning the code.  Just choose a simple application.  When working with Windows, use Visual Studio.  Nothing compares to this program, and I tried them all. <br><br>  <b>Tell us about using Lumia smartphones when shooting video for your TV shows.</b> <br><br>  Our team consists of photographers, and three out of four use Lumia smartphones.  In addition, we do not like to travel with overwhelming belongings.  When I can't shoot a big camera, I use the Lumia 1020. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/233879/">https://habr.com/ru/post/233879/</a></p>
