  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Product Design Digest, December 2014</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Since 2010, I publish regular reviews of recent articles on the topic of interfaces, new tools and collections of patterns, interesting cases and historical stories.  From the tapes of several hundred thematic subscriptions, approximately 5% of the worthwhile publications are selected that are interesting to share.  Previous materials: <a href="http://www.jvetrau.com/category/digest/">April 2010-November 2014</a> . <br><div style="text-align:center;"><img width="147" height="150" src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/982/732/12c/98273212c4a191e96f6691a22bd95c5c.png" alt="Product Design Digest, December 2014"></div><a name="habracut"></a><br><br><h2>  Patterns and Best Practices </h2><br>  <strong><a href="http://www.ibm.com/design/language/">IBM Design Language</a></strong> <br>  IBM released their own visual language, very, very, very coolly described, structured and filed.  Many interesting details, approaches to the description of guidelines.  Although these are rather principles, there are almost no concrete practical applications.  No specific numbers in the interface and typographic grids, only the principles of their construction.  For a company of their scale - the staff of designers should reach up to 1000 people, and the number of products is endless - this approach gives flexibility while respecting the general spirit of design.  Recently some more guidelines appeared: <br><ul><li>  <a href="https://bufferapp.com/style-guide">Buffer</a> </li><li>  <a href="https://users.cs.jmu.edu/bernstdh/web/common/policies/NASA_StyleGuide_Nov06.pdf">Nasa</a> </li></ul><br><br>  <strong><a href="https://storify.com/xiwcx/there-is-no-fold-1">There is no fold</a></strong> <br>  Welch Canavan has gathered together many well-known publications, debunking the myth that users do not scroll pages.  Recently, a high-profile article appeared in a blog of Huge Inc <a href="http://hugeinc.com/ideas/perspective/everybody-scrolls">about their research on the topic</a> .  Although the myth itself that users are afraid of scrolling has been debunked many times, what they did in Huge raises a lot of questions.

      My colleague from the usability laboratory, Ksenia Sternina, describes the problems: ‚ÄúThe article is completely unscientific, the respondents did not understand which ones, the test was carried out incomprehensibly as, the incentives presented to the respondents are unclear.  Some results have turned out, maybe something like this is in reality, but the testing has been done amateurishly.  Below are the details. <br><br>  <em>It has been confirmed that it has</em> <br>  Here it is not clear, yet these users, who are they?  Maybe it's babies or pensioners, or miners, who are they after all?  In scientific studies they never take "some kind of broad cohort."  They take very specific people who can be attributed to a particular segment, and then look at the result, if they all show the same result, then we can already say that in such and such segments the same result.  And in order to test "all", then all-all is necessary and tested. <br><br>  <em>For a long time, we‚Äôve been able to maximize the timeline.</em> <br>  Very strange promise.  Are they trying to get results or test methods?  Usually, if you test a method, you don‚Äôt use the results specifically, because in the process you experiment and the results will be invalid. <br><br>  <em>Users over 3 days</em> <br>  Who are these people, age, gender, what devices they use, what experience with different sites? <br><br>  <em>We tested four design versions</em> <br>  And the pictures on the page were the same?  If yes, then the person will already guess what the trick is, if not, then the content itself can affect.  Typically, test objects are mixed among other ‚Äúcontrol‚Äù objects. <br><br>  <em>X% scrolled immediately</em> <br>  What is it like?  In a second, half a second?  Some people have not scrolled.  Why, I wonder, maybe these people have something in common? <br><br>  The test procedure is not described at all.  It is written that deleted tests, but how were they performed?  Contact people and send links?  Or one link?  What instructions did people give?  This is very important because all this greatly influences the behavior of people. ‚Äù <br><br>  Earlier this year, the <a href="http://mjparnell.com/bullshit_science_ux_design/">best article on pseudo-science in design from MJ Parnell</a> was published.  It is extremely sad that the study of Huge, Inc. has spread throughout the Internet and published by all who can.  Yes, the myth that people do not scroll is false and many times refuted.  But specifically, this article makes conclusions completely unprofessional. <br><br>  <strong><a href="https://medium.com/circa/the-right-way-to-ask-users-to-review-your-app-9a32fd604fca">Review your app</a></strong> <br>  Circa's Matt Galligan talks about an unobtrusive way to get app evaluation from users.
