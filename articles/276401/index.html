Our first book for children <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/company/piter/blog/266019/">‚ÄúThe first book of the young programmer.</a>  <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/company/piter/blog/266019/">Learning to write programs on Scratch ‚Äù</a> was a success with readers and we decided to publish a wonderful book by Warren Sand and Carter Sand.  This post is addressed to children and their parents. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/c48/f09/1d0/c48f091d06794e028829bccc06be0c58.jpg" align="left" alt="image">  Do you like computer toys?  Do you want to try to write something yourself?  Imagine how your friends will respect you when you show them a game of your own design, where, when you boot, your name will appear on the screen!  ‚ÄúThat's cool!‚Äù They will say, downloading it from your page.  And the most beautiful girl in the classroom, having learned about it, will finally pay attention to you ... <br>  But for this you need to learn how to program.  It's complicated?  Well, not really. <br>  The main thing is to set a goal and rush to it like a rhino through the jungle.  You probably know that there are quite a few programming languages, but we suggest you learn how to ‚Äúwrite code‚Äù, as professionals say, in Python (Python).  It is relatively easy to learn, but has all the necessary functions.  The programs on it are fast and easy to read. <br>  This book on Python was written by two people.  Adult uncle-programmer and his son.  This son was also a teenager quite recently, he knows how it is sometimes dreary to learn, and therefore he made sure that Dad was not explained very abstrusely.  So if you never programmed, it doesn't matter.  If you are familiar with the basics - e-mail, Internet, mp3, you can run or save the file - you will understand everything.  Good luck in mastering! <br><br><a name="habracut"></a>

    <h5>  Why python </h5><br>  Why among the many programming languages ‚Äã‚Äã(and there are really a lot of them!), The authors chose Python?  Here are some reasons: <br>  - Python was originally designed in such a way that it was easy to learn.  Programs written in Python are read, written and understood much easier than programs in other languages; <br>  - Python interpreter is absolutely free.  You can download it as well as many useful and fun programs without spending a dime; <br>  - Python software is open source.  And this means, in particular, that any user can extend the capabilities of Python-programs (by adding additional functionality or by simplifying the solution of some tasks).  Many users do just that, with the result that there is a large collection of free software available for download; <br>  - Python is not a toy.  This language is not only well suited for learning programming, but is also used by thousands of professionals around the world, including NASA and Google employees.  And this means that after learning Python, you do not have to switch to a ‚Äúreal‚Äù language to create ‚Äúreal‚Äù programs.  Python allows you to implement a huge number of tasks; <br>  - Python programs can be run on different computers.  They run on Windows PCs, Macs, and Linux machines.  In most cases, the Python program running at home on a Windows machine will work without any problems with the Mac OS X operating system. You can read this book sitting in front of any computer on which the Python interpreter is installed (and if you want to use the computer with no Python interpreter, you can download it for free); <br><br><h5>  For fun </h5><br>  It remains to mention just one thing ... One of the most attractive entertainment for children is computer games with graphics and sound.  We will learn to write our own games and add graphics and sound to them.  Here are examples of the programs we are going to create: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/c1a/509/a84/c1a509a8414f4226814b263a2585a8ed.PNG" alt="image"><br><br>  The authors think (at least hope) that you will find learning the basics of programming and creating the first programs as fascinating as landing a spacecraft on the surface of the Moon or controlling a skier going down the slope. <br>  This book teaches the basics of programming.  It is intended for children, but it is also useful for adults who decide to learn how a computer is programmed.  No special programming skills are required to read this book, but it is advisable to have an idea of ‚Äã‚Äãthe basics of working with a computer.  Enough skills to use e-mail, search for information on the web, listen to music, play games and write essays.  If you can run programs, open and save files, you will have no problems. <br><br><h5>  What you need </h5><br>  This book teaches programming in Python.  The Python interpreter is a free application and is available for download on various sites, including the book site.  To study programming with this book you will need the following things. <br>  - The book itself (of course!). <br>  - Computer with Windows, Mac OS X or Linux operating system.  All the code examples presented in the book were performed on a computer with a Windows operating system.  (On <a href="http://www.manning.com/books/hello-world-second-edition">the</a> book <a href="http://www.manning.com/books/hello-world-second-edition">site</a> you can find additional recommendations for Mac and Linux users.) <br>  - Basic computer skills (running programs, saving files, etc.).  If these things are difficult for you, ask your parents or teacher for help. <br>  - Permission to install the Python interpreter on your computer (from parents, teacher or another person in charge of your machine).  We strongly recommend using the Hello World installation program.  It will provide you with exactly the version of Python that is required to read this book.  The installer can be found on the <a href="http://www.manning.com/books/hello-world-second-edition">website</a> . <br>  - The desire to learn and experiment, even if at first you will get far from all. <br><br><h5>  Work with a book </h5><br>  Here are some tips to help you get the most out of reading this book. <br>  - Personally check all encountered code examples. <br>  ∆í∆í- Try to type programs manually. <br>  ∆í∆í- Answer control questions. <br>  ∆í∆í- Do not worry and have fun! <br><br><h5>  What's new in the second edition </h5><br>  What remains unchanged.  We decided to leave the Python 2 interpreter and not go to Python 3. The reasons for this step are explained in Chapter 1. And now the innovations that appeared in the second edition. <br>  - We added color and notes explaining the difference between Python 2 and Python 3. <br>  ∆í∆í- A chapter on Python dictionaries has been added to Chapter 12. <br>  ∆í∆í- Considering the programming of graphical interfaces in Chapter 20, we have moved from the now not supported PythonCard to the more common PyQt.  This application was also used to create the Hangman program in chapter 22 and Virtual Pet in chapter 24. <br>  ∆í∆í- In additional chapter 25, the principle of operation of the Skier program was explained in detail, with little or no explanation presented in chapter 10. <br>  ∆í∆í- Additional chapter 26 is devoted to the artificial intelligence of robots fighting each other. <br><br>  More information about the book can be found on <a href="http://www.piter.com/product/hello-world-zanimatelnoe-programmirovanie">the publisher's website</a> . <br>  <a href="http://storage.piter.com/upload/contents/978549601273/978549601273_X.pdf">Table of contents</a> <br>  <a href="http://storage.piter.com/upload/contents/978549601273/978549601273_p.pdf">Excerpt</a> <br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Examples of pages:</b> <div class="spoiler_text"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/e32/d49/d09/e32d49d0933d4867a8f407a0de35c3b5.PNG"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/482/35d/dcd/48235ddcd3c844149adcd14616260902.PNG"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/eb7/c36/3b4/eb7c363b457049aba5799e9926d1b05d.PNG"></div></div><br><br>  For Habrozhiteley 25% discount coupon - <b>Hello World!</b> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/276401/">https://habr.com/ru/post/276401/</a></p>
