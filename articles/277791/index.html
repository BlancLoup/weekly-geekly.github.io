  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Wash down with me CRM! About types of refinement</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  In the promotional materials of CRM vendors, you can find the words ‚Äúto refine the system to the needs of your business‚Äù, ‚Äúindividual approach‚Äù and ‚Äúabsolute customization‚Äù.  I think no one will deny that every business is unique, especially it will not be denied by business owners, on whom assurances of customization and fitting of systems to the requirements of the company are calculated.  However, in addition to the truth about the possibilities of refinement and adaptation to a specific set of business requirements, the vendor‚Äôs promises hide significant costs, the amount of which may exceed the cost of licenses acquired.  Let's try to figure out what types of ‚Äúdoped‚Äù CRM exist and whether the suit is always important. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/52a/7bf/7a2/52a7bf7a2e1f4e97b7ea0c8128f11687.jpg"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  First of all, consider the motives of the vendor, which encourage him to create SDK (software development kit) and the so-called platform. <br><br><ul><li>  <b>Development of partnership schemes.</b>  By providing partners with the development and development tools for their CRM system, the vendor has an excellent opportunity to grow their regional networks and distribute the supplied software.  Partners, in turn, can earn on modifications and personalization of the system.  A striking example of such a platform expansion is 1C, which built a huge network of franchisees at the expense of a platform for creating individual configurations.

    </li><li>  <b>The development of its system.</b>  Companies open an SDK and / or API to enable technology partners to create plugins, widgets, integrations, and connectors for the main system.  Partners place their developments in marketplaces where they are available to users for a fee or for free.  Thus, the client receives the current opportunities, the partner - the money, and the vendor saves users who could leave without finding the necessary functionality.  Such a scheme is also attractive for foreign companies entering the Russian market - they are not invested in development related to the adaptation of software to local requirements (for example, Microsoft Dynamics CRM uses connectors created by partners to integrate with 1C). <br><br></li><li>  <b>The possibility of self-development system vendor to the needs of the user.</b>  Creating a platform, the developer gets a tool for quick customization and creating custom software.  This is convenient, above all to him.  Also, the platform can be used by customers who have a professional programmer on staff. <br><br></li><li>  <b>Formation of expert community around the system.</b>  As a rule, large systems release community versions (open source), which are distributed under a free license (for example, GNU AGPL).  The fee is taken for consulting and technical support.  In addition, a strong community is an excellent marketing tool. <br></li></ul><br>  In addition to these motives, there are several more - they are individual for each development company and may depend on various factors, including expansion into new markets, development of industry solutions, and so on. <br><br>  Consider the main types of refinement of CRM by groups and try to determine which business is suitable for one or another option. <br><br><h2>  <font color="#8a0428">Open source CRM</font> </h2><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/e91/666/315/e91666315cc04a1ca85bbe3ccaa5c25f.jpg"><br><br><h3>  <b>Sugar crm</b> </h3><br>  The most famous open source CRM is Sugar CRM.  It is developed and refined in PHP.  A typical SugarCRM configuration uses MySQL or Microsoft SQL Server Compact Edition as a DBMS, commercial versions can use Microsoft SQL Server 2008 and Oracle.  The system is supplied with a module for visual development (Studio).  With it, a user who is not familiar with programming can create new modules and make changes to old ones.  For SugarCRM, by directly accessing the database or developing custom PHP code, an integration scheme of almost any complexity can be created. <br><br>  One Sugar CRM license costs from $ 40 per month per user.  Licenses are divided into three types: Comunity Edition - full-featured free version and paid versions of Professional and Enterprise (needed for those who choose Oracle).  Developers can create add-ons for Sugar CRM (add-ons) and place them in <a href="https://sugarexchange.sugarcrm.com/home">Sugarexchange</a> .  For Russian developers, the <a href="http://sugartalk.ru/">Sugartalk</a> community is <a href="http://sugartalk.ru/">supported</a> .  The Open Source version is distributed under the GNU AGPL license and is available for download at <a href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/sugarcrm/%3Fsource%3Dtop3_dlp_t5">Sourceforge</a> .  After installation on the client's server, the developer can make any changes to the code, customizing the system for himself. <br><br>  The GNU GPL license implies that the user receives the rights to copy, modify, and distribute (including on a commercial basis) programs, and to ensure that users of all derivative programs will receive the rights listed above.  That is, when creating a new CRM based on Sugar CRM, you must open the code and give users the same rights.  Therefore, many developers from around the world create their own versions of programs based on the Sugar open source forks (fork).  One of the most popular CRM, sometimes leading in popularity on Sourceforge Sugar, is vTiger CRM. <br><br><h3>  <b>vTiger CRM</b> </h3><br>  <a href="https://www.vtiger.com/">vTiger CRM</a> has an open <a href="https://www.vtiger.com/open-source/">version</a> and a paid version.  Technical support for users, depending on the package, costs from $ 10 to $ 30 per user per month.  Like other systems, vTiger has a marketplace that contains sets of plug-ins and connectors, for example, with Asterisk or Microsoft Exchange. <br><br>  There are several Russian vTiger forks (for example, <a href="http://www.optimacrm.ru/">Optima CRM</a> ).  They contain industry versions, are promoted for free of charge of their systems, but often require improvements.  Moreover, upon closer inspection, the same Optima is not free, and freebies appear only after an order of refinement for 250,000 rubles. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/339/b55/4b4/339b554b4bb945638d6db1a1d923d6f0.png">  <b>The advantages of such solutions:</b> <br><br><ul><li>  Open source - the ability to refine the system, create fork, adapt to any business logic. <br></li><li>  Universality and portability, low dependence on iron configuration (not always). <br></li><li>  Modularity - with proper qualifications, you can assemble any corporate system. <br></li><li>  High customization. <br></li><li>  Huge community (developer community). <br></li></ul><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/0e9/8d5/c1d/0e98d5c1d2324c7884c051d76f46b507.png">  <b>The disadvantages of such solutions:</b> <br><br><ul><li>  High wages of qualified programmers with the appropriate skills. <br></li><li>  Serious restrictions on users in paid versions (there is a minimum of places to buy). <br></li><li>  High overhead during implementation and substandard deployment. <br></li><li>  Problems with localization (translation) - if through the Language Pack it is possible to Russify the interface and admin panels, then the dictionaries of the system itself need to be restarted. <br></li><li>  The systems and their forks often do not take into account national standards for primary documentation, warehouse management, office management, and so on. <br></li><li>  Weak analytic modules in the main delivery - you need to buy more or add solutions for business analytics. <br></li></ul><br><h2>  <font color="#8a0428">Paid CRM-systems with platforms and SDK</font> </h2><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/86d/df3/5bb/86ddf35bbc3e4b4b950172f495f00b93.jpg"><br><br>  This group of CRM-systems is a system with paid licenses and closed code.  However, if necessary, they provide development platforms and SDKs for clients, as well as carry out customization on their own, using the listed tools.  The pioneer of CRM-structure (as well as a pioneer in many aspects of the development of CRM) is the world's largest system. <br><br><h3>  <b>Salesforce CRM (Salesforce.com)</b> </h3><br>  <a href="http://www.salesforce.com/">Salesforce is</a> delivered to customers only on the SaaS model.  The company also created a whole group of development tools: for example, under the name Force.com, the company provides the PaaS platform for independent application development, and under the Database.com brand (Data.com) - a cloud database management system. <br><br>  App Cloud <a href="http://www.salesforce.com/platform/products/force/%2520FORCE">Force.com</a> is a software platform on which Sales Cloud and Service Cloud are developed, provided to subscribers for self-development of applications and extensions for the Salesforce.com CRM system. <br><br>  The development uses its own Java-like Apex language and Visualforce's own design tool with an XML-based output format that provides custom HTML / AJAX and Flex interfaces.  The platform is provided exclusively by subscription, within the framework of the PaaS concept.  Depending on the subscription level, various technical and support options are available.  Subscribers can place developed applications on the Force.com platform in a special directory - AppExchange, including for money. <br>  Cloud DBMS, Data.com, can be used both for applications and for their projects not related to the system.  There is a cool solution for the design of interfaces - Lightning Components, which allows you to quickly create interfaces and logic of web applications using HTML, CSS and JavaScript.  Depending on the tariff, refinement options are limited by the number of tables per user, access, etc. <br><br>  Salesforce is a fairly expensive system, if you decide on its implementation, it is worthwhile to calculate the potential costs of the refinement services or the wages of a qualified programmer.  However, this is not the only solution; there are Russian solutions, and moreover, they are more adapted to our reporting and integration with accounting systems. <br><br><h3>  <b>Terrasoft CRM (bpm'online)</b> </h3><br>  <a href="https://www.terrasoft.ru/">Terrasoft</a> offers its customers two types of <a href="https://www.terrasoft.ru/products/platforms">platforms</a> : Terrasoft 3.X for developing desktop applications (business old-timers will surely remember the old desktop solution Terrasoft) and bpm'online for developing web applications. <br><br>  Terrasoft 3.X allows you to create modules and configurations for the desktop application Terrasoft, to change the functionality.  IDE Terrasoft 3.X includes visual development tools and a database query designer, window, report designer, and so on.  All configuration elements are stored on the DBMS side, only the changed part of the meta data is loaded to the user.  Applications can be deployed under the control of MS SQL Server, Oracle or Firebird, and SSL is supported for web services.  With Tearrasoft 3.X, you can build integrations with third-party applications. <br><br>  bpm'online is an IDE for creating and configuring application systems on the bpm'online platform.  Using this IDE, web applications are created that work on the user side through a browser.  Applications are hosted in the cloud (the application is deployed in a data center), HTML, AJAX, Silverlight and the .Net programming language are used for development.  Business processes are built in a visual graphical editor using BPMN notation, and no programming knowledge is required of the user.  The bpm'online platform allows you to quickly create user interfaces for drag-and-drop, that is, to configure and create applications is simple, the system automatically generates a user interface.  If the application is supposed to be deployed on-site, then you need to use MS SQL Server or Oracle DBMS.  bpm'online uses SOA (service-oriented architecture), which allows you to develop applications based on the use of distributed, loosely coupled replaceable components, equipped with standardized interfaces for interoperability over protocols. This architecture provides manageability and scalability of solutions. <br><br>  <a href="https://www.terrasoft.ru/">Terrasoft</a> is one of the most expensive Russian CRM systems, and the platform is available only to those who have already acquired licenses.  However, the advantage of Terrasoft is in the ease of use of the platform, in particular bpm'online for creating web applications. <br><br><h3>  <b>Client-Communicator (Click CRM)</b> </h3><br>  <a href="http://www.bmicro.ru/">The system is</a> much cheaper than Terrasoft, although it is more outdated both in terms of the interface and purely in design.  However, this is one of the first Russian CRM, offering a platform for refinement and deep customization of applications.  In addition, recently appeared still raw, but quite functional web-version of the system for those who like to work in the browser. <br><br>  For the finalization of the web version, <a href="http://www.bmicro.ru/">CliC</a> uses a form designer, which allows you to create solutions from simple tables related to the system database to web applications.  Both configurations for Windows and web users work in a single on-line database.  In principle, the solution is very good and requires fairly standard knowledge (you do not have to overpay for the unique skills of the hired specialist), but it is also inert from the point of view of the technologies used. <br><br>  The first trouble that awaits the client is the need to acquire MS SQL Server 2008 Standard, Developer or Enterprise if more than 15 places are needed and the size of the database exceeds 10 GB.  As you know, these are paid DBMS and they significantly increase the cost of the implementation project. <br>  The second feature is, of course, not a nuisance, but an uncomfortable thing for many modern developers - the whole platform is focused on Microsoft tools.  To work with the platform, you must first deploy the Microsoft .NET Framework, and then deploy IIS. <br><br>  Integration with WEB is created using ASP.NET technology.  On the site, the vendor states that this technology, due to the presence of an expanding set of controls, allows for faster development of new components (types of charts, indicators, etc.).  When building interactive web-interfaces, AJAX technology is used, which changes part of the data without reloading the page completely. <br>  However, it is obvious that in the case of working with Linux-like operating systems, to use the platform you will have to be bothered with Mono and Nginx, and this is a waste of time and additional requirements for personnel qualifications. <br><br>  To finalize the Clic in the configurator, the scripting platform is used using the programming language Jscript or VBScript (optional).  Using the platform, you can program a click interface, work with a database, design form components, write scripts, etc.  The interface is configured in the interface designer. <br><br>  A click is good because it provides the most extensive customization options and, at the same time, requires the user to master the standard skills.  Among the shortcomings - obsession with Microsoft technologies, the use of expensive, heavy and capricious MS SQL DBMS, outdated interface elements and the incompleteness of the web version.  In general, this is the case when you have to work well with a ‚Äúfile‚Äù. <br><br>  For those who are lazy or who do not have the opportunity to engage in refinement, the development / revision of the system by Klik forces costs 2500 rubles per hour.  With an 8-hour working day and 21 days in a month, this is 420,000 r.  per month.  Therefore, before implementation it is necessary to plan the revision and estimate the total cost of the implementation project. <br><br>  Well, somehow it would be completely unscrupulous not to mention in this section of the post <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/ru-ru/dynamics/crm.aspx">Microsoft Dynamics CRM</a> , offering partners an excellent set of development tools, with the help of which applications, forms, connectors, etc. are created.  In addition, for this CRM there are separate SDKs for mobile development for iOS and Android. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/339/b55/4b4/339b554b4bb945638d6db1a1d923d6f0.png">  <b>The advantages of such solutions:</b> <br><br><ul><li>  Modularity and customization. <br></li><li>  The combination of ready-made solutions and good development platforms. <br></li><li>  A set of numerous industry solutions. <br></li><li>  Convenience and benefits for partners. <br></li><li>  The simplicity of the means of refinement. <br></li><li>  Not the highest salary expectations of programmers (exception - Salesforce). <br></li></ul><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/0e9/8d5/c1d/0e98d5c1d2324c7884c051d76f46b507.png">  <b>The disadvantages of such solutions:</b> <br><br><ul><li>  The high cost of refinement by the vendor. <br></li><li>  Flaws in the platforms themselves, insufficient set of features in the basic delivery. <br></li><li>  Very often - attachment to technology, system requirements and dependence on the configuration of iron. <br></li></ul><br><h2>  <font color="#8a0428">Strong standard delivery, completion by vendor</font> </h2><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/2d6/eab/1ba/2d6eab1bab2e48b3a81a4b262010e68c.png"><br><br>  This is no less interesting group of CRM-systems than the previous ones.  They are distinguished by an accumulated set of capabilities that accommodates the entire experience of the vendor, that is, the system contains well-developed modules and module entities.  As a rule, these systems include several editions in order to delimit the scope of the supplied functionality and save the client from unnecessary functions that do not meet his requirements.  They provide standard designers of interfaces and reports for minimal customization of the system and carry out custom development / development of the system for a specific client. <br><br><h3>  <b>RegionSoft CRM</b> </h3><br>  Perhaps one of the best CRM systems in this class.  In addition to typical classic CRM, <a href="http://www.regionsoft.ru/">RegionSoft</a> supplies several industry solutions (for retail, restaurants, tele-radio holdings, GPS monitoring).  The editions of the classic desktop CRM systems include a different set of included modules.  Industry systems are specialized products with deeply reworked business logic, and not just with renamed card fields.  In general, the company is sufficiently closed from external agents, but it is known that industry systems have just grown out of integration projects, that is, in fact, they were developed in ‚Äúfield‚Äù conditions, therefore, many business requirements are taken into account. <br><br>  <a href="http://regionsoft.ru/loader.php%3Fsrc%3Dcrm_redactions">The individual editions of</a> RegionSoft CRM are designed for various business sizes: from a simple sales department to holdings with a warehouse and production.  This approach is due to the lack of an open development platform for external programmers.  This is not a modular solution (as I see it, it would be an ideal solution for a CRM provider), but a concept quite close to it.  All integrations (with Asterisk PBX, 1C, own SIP background) are included in the delivery of the respective editions. <br><br>  The highlight of RegionSoft CRM are advanced mechanisms for automating sales, business processes and KPI (key performance management), as well as advanced warehouse accounting with production management, vendor bids, logistics, and even the ability to automate retail stores and restaurants (additional front-office modules RegionSoft Retail and RegionSoft Barman closely integrates with RegionSoft CRM, which in this case acts as back office). <br><br>  Inside the system, you can customize the user interface, create custom fields and reports using the Fast Report report designer, business processes using a visual graphical editor.  Starting with the RegionSoft CRM Professional edition, the configurator has been included in the system.  Using the configurator, it is possible to gain access to all database sections, execute SQL queries and process them, create additional database objects and an interface.  The report designer allows you to create new (user) reports, as well as modify typical system reports and connect them to the program interface.  With the help of the configurator's script engine, it is possible to organize the integration of RegionSoft CRM with third-party products, both at the level of COM connections, and with the help of upload and download data in XML format. <br><br>  RegionSoft CRM vendor has developed an additional application - the <a href="http://www.regionsoft.ru/loader.php%3Fsrc%3Dappsrv">RegionSoft Application Server</a> software script <a href="http://www.regionsoft.ru/loader.php%3Fsrc%3Dappsrv">server</a> with the built-in http-server.  This is a separately supplied tool that allows you to automate various tasks (such as automatically uploading data to 1C on a schedule, background backups of the database), integrate CRM with a personal account on a website or an online store, analyze and process data, send e-mail and sms, write scripts based on open source software scripts in one of the languages: PascalScript, C ++ Script, JScript, BasicScript. <br><br>  It is also possible to order the development of an individual corporate system or the revision of the current version of CRM.  As reconnaissance in force has shown, the price of the project is set by agreement, and the price per hour of completion is 1500 rubles, which is 252,000 rubles.  in conditional working month. <br><br>  Among the shortcomings, some redundancy of functionality can be noted even in the most "lightweight" version.  On the other hand, RegionSoft is perhaps the most democratic system desktop CRM system ‚Äî neither the system itself nor the configurator require an expensive MS SQL Server, but work on an open source, fast and well-established Firebird database. <br><br><h3>  <b>ASoft CRM</b> </h3><br>  <a href="http://www.asoft.ru/">ASoft CRM</a> is another experienced player in the market for turnkey solutions and customized development.  The company creates solutions for workflow, logistics, CRM, project management systems and industry solutions.  Solutions are diversified depending on the type of company, the method of organizing warehouse accounting, the need for renting software.  Industry versions are also narrowly specific: banks, real estate, logistics companies.  These CRMs are also based on rethinking business logic, rather than simply changing forms. <br><br>  In addition to industry solutions, the company creates information systems to the requirements of specific customers.  The development is based on the <a href="http://asoft.ru/solution/techno/techno.php">StellArt / EFFI</a> platform <a href="http://asoft.ru/solution/techno/techno.php">used by ASoft</a> - a complex, unified platform.  The EFFI environment was created by the company to create C ++ applications.  The platform can be used as a full-fledged IDE and as a set of libraries and library packages for isolated use.  The application software on the EFFI platform uses the classic three-layer logic scheme: data storage layer, data processing layer, data presentation layer.  For web applications, the JavaScript programming language and AJAX technology are used.  Currently, plug-ins have been developed that support SOAP, HTTP, SMTP / POP, and internal EFFI protocol. <br><br>  The EFFI system also provides wide integration possibilities and provides work with an online store (it should be written in PHP), interaction with other web services.  The IDE also includes libraries for integration with PBXs, including AVAYA and Asterisk, supports the LDAP protocol and allows for authorization and authentication through Active Directory.  EFFI - cross-platform development environment.  EFFI applications can be compiled under Windows, Linux and MacOS operating systems. <br><br>  In general, ASoft owns, indeed, a serious development tool, based on which you can create applications for commercial use.  The cost of projects is formed on request. <br><br><h3>  <b>ELMA</b> </h3><br>  <a href="http://www.elma-bpm.ru/product/crm/">ELMA CRM</a> is also a strong player in the market for ready-made corporate information systems.  ELMA is more focused on business processes: on the ELMA BPM platform, both classical CRM and document management and projects are based.  In addition, the vendor delivers a large number of industry solutions, each of which is based on business logic and, importantly, industry risks.  The system aims to minimize each of the potential risks. <br><br>  <a href="http://www.elma-bpm.ru/">ELMA</a> has taken the biggest step towards modularity: in the <a href="https://store.elma-bpm.ru/">ELMA Store</a> section, you can assemble your own set of modules, ready-made business processes and solutions, initially customizing your system.  The proposed components help deploy automation fairly quickly.  But keep in mind that these are still unified schemes and something may not fit your business.  Alas, in the case of business processes, inattention to trifles can turn into big problems: having bought a ready-made component, you have to seriously rework it or rebuild your tasks and processes under the resulting template.  This can lead to both tangible costs and unpleasant sabotage of staff. <br><br>  The built-in designer of the ELMA system is quite good in terms of usability and allows you to independently build business processes in accordance with BPMN 2.0 notation.  Moreover, the features of the notation and the logic of the Designer allow even non-advanced users to work. <br>  ELMA also offers custom development and refinement based on the main system in accordance with the terms of reference.  The price of the project is discussed individually. <br><br>  Alas, ELMA requires MS SQL Server to work, which, again, greatly increases the cost of any implementation project.  Moreover, the site has a clause that MS SQL Server Enterprise allows you to ensure the maximum level of performance and scalability of the application (the price is about 180,000 rubles). <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/339/b55/4b4/339b554b4bb945638d6db1a1d923d6f0.png">  <b>The advantages of such solutions:</b> <br><br><ul><li>  Initially strong basic delivery functionality. <br></li><li>  Regular releases, constant improvements and extensions, rather large-scale updates. <br></li><li>  Availability of industry solutions with recycled business logic. <br></li><li>  Ready and often included in the delivery of integration solutions (PBX, telephony, 1C). <br></li><li>  There are no restrictions on the choice of telephony provider. <br></li><li>  Quick revision by vendor employees, professional approach. <br></li><li>  Easy customization at the advanced user level. <br></li><li>  The cost of ownership and implementation of one of the lowest in the market due to "threading". <br></li></ul><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/0e9/8d5/c1d/0e98d5c1d2324c7884c051d76f46b507.png">  <b>The disadvantages of such solutions:</b> <br><br><ul><li>  Inflexibility - major changes require time and money. <br></li><li>  Sometimes restrictions related to system requirements (OS, database server). <br></li><li>  Low level of self customization. <br></li><li>  Excessive functionality in standard delivery. <br></li><li>  Virtually no community, closed development. <br></li></ul><br><h2>  <font color="#8a0428">Cloud CRM with API</font> </h2><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/af2/bf8/7d4/af2bf87d445346dfbf60605e661fedb4.png"><br><br>  Needless to say, cloud systems have captured the market.  Despite a number of shortcomings, they are popular due to the convenience of payment, speed of implementation, scalability and modern interface.  For a long time, a serious complaint was made against this class of CRM - the complexity of refinement.  Indeed, most cloud vendors prefer their product to be downloaded and installed ‚Äúas is‚Äù, with a maximum of adding the required fields and field clusters.<font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">However, the accusation of inflexibility was too weighty to continue to ignore. </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Therefore, most well-known vendors have created an API (application programming interface) for their systems. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">An API is a set of ready-made components (classes, functions, constants, etc.) that can be used in external products. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The API allows you to create applications that are easily integrated with the main program. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">That is, again, the same widgets, connectors and applications for the "completion" of CRM, which partners use to generate income, and customers - for their own needs. </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Briefly consider the API and the capabilities of the most popular systems.</font></font><br><br><h3> <b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">amoCRM</font></font></b> </h3><br> <a href="https://developer.amocrm.ru/rest_api/"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">the API amo</font></font></a><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> . Working with the API is in PHP. All communication with the API is encrypted via SSL. This means that all links to the API must contain the HTTPS protocol. It is especially important to remember this when accessing via JS, if it is initiated to access third-party resources. Inside the system, the user is always in a secure connection and the attempt to access HTTP will be blocked or the user's browser will give him a warning. </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Third-party developers can create widgets for </font></font><a href="http://www.amocrm.ru/"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">amoCRM</font></font></a><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> either using pure JavaScript or using PHP libraries. Widgets in amoCRM can display application data in CRM interfaces, connect JS scripts, and so on. AmoCRM add-ons can also go to the </font></font><a href="https://www.amocrm.ru/extensions/"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">catalog of ready-made widgets.</font></font></a><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">However, when using third-party widgets, the user should not forget that the relationship goes into three planes: amo, cloud hoster, and the owner of the widget. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">This may require additional costs and greater attention to system security and potential vulnerabilities. </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Even in amoCRM, you can configure notifications that will inform third-party applications about events that occurred in CRM. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">For notifications, rules are created according to which they are processed (for example, when you save an order in an online store, a contact is automatically created in CRM).</font></font><br><br><h3> <b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">FreshOffice CRM</font></font></b> </h3><br> <a href="http://docs.freshofficeapi.apiary.io/"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">FreshOffice API is</font></font></a><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> designed to exchange data between FreshOffice application databases and external clients. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Access to the API is provided by the Open Data Protocol. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">OData is a standardized protocol specifically designed for use in API systems. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">By the way, FreshOffice APIs are developed using a convenient apiary service that allows you to create a well-readable API in a matter of hours (well, or as the main page of the service claims, in 30 minutes). </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Subjectively, this is the weakest API of the listed systems - the feeling that it was created in order to "suddenly what, but it was." </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">I think this is partly due to the initially good set of system capabilities. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">That, however, FreshOffice does not justify.</font></font><br><br><h3> <b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Bitrix24</font></font></b> </h3><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">In </font></font><a href="https://www.bitrix24.ru/"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Bitriks24</font></font></a><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> , on the contrary, a developed API, designed in the form of a separate document with good navigation. </font></font><a href="https://www.bitrix24.ru/apps/api.php"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The Bitrix24 API</font></font></a><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> allows you to create applications and plug-ins for the purposes of a company or placement on a marketplace. Each new third-party application is a new client in oAuth 2.0 with its own set of security keys and a list of permissions for this application (it can view tasks, CRM, etc.). Created applications and connectors can be placed in the marketplace, where they will be available for free or for other users. </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">For the cloud version of Bitrix24, the PHP REST API is used, and for the boxed version, the API called </font></font><a href="http://dev.1c-bitrix.ru/api_help/"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Bitrix Framework</font></font></a><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">- A technology platform for managing websites and corporate portals. This, of course, is not a tool for full-fledged refinement, but it provides good opportunities for organizing the portal and its administration (LDAP, telephony, etc.) </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">By the way, Bitrix24 has a pretty strong community and a good reference forum. That, however, is not surprising for such an experienced player. However, despite the many advantages, Bitriks24 has one global flaw, which often leads to huge improvements and the cost of the implementation project. Bitrix24 is not a CRM. The CRM module embedded in the corporate portal is not enough for many specific business tasks, ranging from full-fledged mailings to warehouse management. When choosing a vendor, this must be remembered. </font></font><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/339/b55/4b4/339b554b4bb945638d6db1a1d923d6f0.png"> <b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The advantages of such solutions:</font></font></b> <br><br><ul><li>        ,     . <br></li><li>     API, . <br></li><li>   ,   . <br></li><li>          . <br></li><li>  . <br></li></ul><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/0e9/8d5/c1d/0e98d5c1d2324c7884c051d76f46b507.png"> <b>  :</b> <br><br><ul><li>  ,     ,   . <br></li><li>     ‚Äî    . <br></li><li>   . <br></li><li>   . <br></li></ul><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">There is another way to create a CRM, the most suitable company, - write it yourself, "on the knee." But this is also an expensive, lengthy and time-consuming project, besides requiring incredible skill in collecting and processing business requirements. As a rule, this method is suitable only for very specific companies that have specific industry requirements. And then, in my opinion, it is better to entrust the development of an experienced company according to an agreed technical task: firstly, it is faster, secondly, the developer is responsible for the software created, thirdly, he will not quit and take the code with him.</font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The crisis and a slight lull in business is the best time to buy and deploy CRM. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">And the awareness of their exclusivity and the desire to have CRM ‚Äúexactly the size‚Äù is a big corporate temptation. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Before you get involved in a complex ‚Äúcustom‚Äù implementation process, decide on your business requirements, talk to several vendors, try to understand how much you need this or that refinement and how urgent it is. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">A thoughtful, systematic approach and minimal preparation for implementation can save money, time and nerves. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">As you know, they are not superfluous.</font></font></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/277791/">https://habr.com/ru/post/277791/</a></p>
