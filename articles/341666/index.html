Each of the films of the series was shot by one of the famous directors - <a href="https://www.kinopoisk.ru/name/22260/">Spielberg</a> himself, <a href="https://www.kinopoisk.ru/name/77856/">Matthew Robbins</a> , <a href="https://www.kinopoisk.ru/name/6483/">Michael Moore</a> , <a href="https://www.kinopoisk.ru/name/2435/">Robert Zemeckis</a> and others (speakers Alexei Shipilev, Baruch Sadogursky, Yevgeny Borisov, Tagir Valeev, etc.). <br><br>  A lot of interesting bright original films (reports) were successfully combined by the producer (organizers) in the framework of a series of films (conference), as a result only spectators (conference participants) won from all this. <br><br><h3>  Conference preparation </h3><br>  The <a href="https://jugru.org/">JUG.ru Group</a> team invested a lot of effort into the preparation of the conference and spent a lot of time.

In addition, the speakers and representatives of the sponsoring companies were interviewed by Oleg <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/users/olegchir/" class="user_link">olegchir</a> Chirukhin and Yevgeny <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/users/phillennium/" class="user_link">phillennium</a> Trifonov.  Interviews could be seen by viewers of the conference‚Äôs webcast during the breaks between presentations. <br><br><h3>  Conference opening </h3><br>  Andrei Dmitriev and Alexey Fedorov open the conference.  Filled hall during opening. <br><br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/2f/fq/m7/2ffqm7cs0esaatxx_c0jk5-9nmc.jpeg"></a> <br><br><h3>  First Day Reports </h3><br>  A very rich conference program included four tracks with presentations from which one could choose.  Reports of parallel tracks are available in the recording and can be viewed by conference participants at any convenient time. <br><br>  Below is a brief overview of just a quarter of all reports. <br><br>  <b>Java 9: ‚Äã‚Äãthe good parts (not modules)</b> <br>  <i>Cay Horstmann, San Jose State University</i> <br><br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/nx/l5/eb/nxl5eby-shrxufo1i9aqmq2yjck.jpeg"></a> <br><br>  Kay Horstmann is one of the most famous authors in the <i>Java</i> world who has written <a href="https://www.amazon.com/s/ref%3Ddp_byline_sr_book_1%3Fie%3DUTF8%26text%3DCay%2BS.%2BHorstmann%26search-alias%3Dbooks%26field-author%3DCay%2BS.%2BHorstmann%26sort%3Drelevancerank">many books</a> .  His most famous book is the two-volume book <i>Core Java</i> ( <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Core-Java-I-Fundamentals-10th/dp/0134177304/ref%3Dsr_1_1%3Fs%3Dbooks%26ie%3DUTF8%26qid%3D1510225767%26sr%3D1-1%26dpID%3D41dHD22LDJL%26preST%3D_SX218_BO1,204,203,200_QL40_%26dpSrc%3Dsrch">one</a> , <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Core-Java-II-Advanced-Features-10th/dp/0134177290/ref%3Dsr_1_4%3Fs%3Dbooks%26ie%3DUTF8%26qid%3D1510225767%26sr%3D1-4%26dpID%3D41clmx-C4SL%26preST%3D_SX218_BO1,204,203,200_QL40_%26dpSrc%3Dsrch">two</a> tenth editions in English and <a href="https://www.ozon.ru/context/detail/id/137377512/">one</a> , <a href="https://www.ozon.ru/context/detail/id/141529764/">two</a> it is also in Russian).  Even just to look at such an outstanding personality was interesting. <br><br>  The report described the new features of <i>Java 9</i> , not related to modularity.  In addition to the more widely known (convenient methods for constructing collections, <i>JShell</i> , improvements in the <i>Stream API</i> ), other interested features were also interested (for example, new <i>I / O</i> methods and regular expressions, getting information about operating system processes, text resource files in <i>UTF-8</i> ). <br><br>  <b>Java Puzzlers NG S03 - Where are you all climbing something ?!</b> <br>  <i>Tagir Valeev, JetBrains and Baruch Sadogursky, JFrog</i> <br><br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/jk/2j/yo/jk2jyo8qy3kobuf6mfu814ptskq.jpeg"></a> <br><br>  The third season of <i>Java Puzzlers NG</i> was presented as a continuation of the second, which was shown six months ago at the <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/company/jugru/blog/326142/">JPoint 2017</a> conference.  Tagir and Baruch perfectly complemented each other in a report of this type. <br><br>  I was embarrassed while watching the reception, tested in the reports of this series for the first time - the right of the four answers was first declared completely wrong!  Baruch fully enjoyed the effect obtained and even listened to the explanation of the wrong answer (if I am not mistaken, from Evgeny Mandrikov). <br><br>  <b>Java and GPU: where are we now?</b> <br>  <i>Dmitry Alexandrov, T-Systems</i> <br><br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/se/cu/iw/secuiwmkzzqwjziqkohx-fs4es0.jpeg"></a> <br><br>  Excellent overview of the current state of affairs on the possibilities of using <i>GPU</i> from <i>Java</i> .  After an interesting excursion into the history of the development of computing on graphics processors, a description of the current technologies ( <i>CUDA</i> , <i>OpenCL</i> ) and libraries (up to <a href="http://aparapi.com/">Aparapi</a> ) <a href="http://aparapi.com/">followed</a> . <br><br>  Useful well laid out information.  The speaker is fluent in the topic, able to present interesting material and, importantly, fully and clearly answer the questions of the audience. <br><br>  <b>Java 9 modules. Why not OSGi?</b> <br>  <i>Nikita Lipsky, Excelsior LLC</i> <br><br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/pz/tx/g6/pztxg6keku_ntjn-_qrn98cmwgo.jpeg"></a> <br><br>  In May of this year, Nikita spoke at a <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/company/jugru/blog/329728/">meeting of jug.msk.ru</a> during a round of speeches at conferences.  The next day, his speech was scheduled for <a href="https://developer.oracle.com/code/moscow">Oracle Code 2017 Moscow</a> with an earlier version of this report.  It was interesting to hear, finally, this report on <i>Joker</i> . <br><br>  A very deep curious study (with relevant quotations from Kharms and Tolstoy), why the <a href="https://www.osgi.org/">OSGi</a> specification was not used for modularity in <i>Java 9</i> and was designed by <i>Jigsaw</i> . <br><br>  I was impressed by Nikita's interview taken by Evgeny Trifonov on the second day of the conference (the photo can be viewed below).  Information about the history of <a href="https://www.excelsiorjet.com/">Excelsior JET</a> was also supplemented in the course of an interesting story. <br><br>  <b>Text editor - this is not your highest mathematics, you need to think</b> <br>  <i>Alexey Kudryavtsev, JetBrains</i> <br><br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/rw/ou/ky/rwoukyy5afpmpsthvjtj1azjvay.jpeg"></a> <br><br>  Entertaining story about the internal structure of the editor <i>Intellij IDEA</i> .  Used approaches, data structures and algorithms.  Comparison with other famous editors.  Explanation of the reasons for the adopted architectural decisions, their advantages and disadvantages. <br><br>  <b>Shenandoah: a garbage collector that could (part 2)</b> <br>  <i>Alexey Shipilev, Red Hat</i> <br><br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/ff/dv/bv/ffdvbvhbxhgcs8ozw7ktkc9ji7w.jpeg"></a> <br><br>  The second part of the story of the garbage collector <a href="http://openjdk.java.net/jeps/189">Shenandoah</a> .  The first part was presented at the <i>JPoint 2017</i> conference, his video is available <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3DCnRtbtis79U%26feature%3Dyoutu.be">here</a> . <br><br>  The report continued to introduce the features of the technical implementation of <i>Shenandoah</i> , focusing the attention of listeners in more detail on the problems that confront the garbage collector with low pauses. <br><br>  The great attractiveness and popularity of Alexey‚Äôs reports, despite their high technical complexity, once again caused sincere admiration. <br><br>  <b>Java 8: Good, Bad, Angry</b> <br>  <i>Nikolay Alimenkov, XP Injection</i> <br><br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/nw/h8/d7/nwh8d7_gfmaid03ipbaugj2lwlk.jpeg"></a> <br><br>  Nikolay's report was the final on the first day of the conference.  Despite the recent release of <i>Java 9</i> , the topic of correctly using the many features of <i>Java 8</i> is still relevant. <br><br>  The code shown during the report can be viewed <a href="https://github.com/xpinjection/java8-misuses">on GitHub</a> .  Viewing the report was useful, the examples given are interesting, the correspondence with Tagir <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/users/lany/" class="user_link">lany</a> Valeev is <a href="https://twitter.com/tagir_valeev/status/926482027859365888">even funny</a> . <br><br><h3>  First day interview </h3><br>  Those who watched the online broadcast in between the reports had the happy opportunity to see the interviews that Oleg and Yevgeny took.  The interviewers were participants of the program committee, speakers and representatives of sponsoring companies. <br><br>  For example, the representative of the first group (a member of the program committee) is Vladimir Sitnikov.  Examples of speakers - Nitsan Vakart and Tagir Valeev.  A representative of the parallel <i>.NET</i> universe - Andrey <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/users/dreamwalker/" class="user_link">DreamWalker</a> Akinshin (speaker of another conference held by <i>JUG.ru</i> - <a href="https://dotnext-moscow.ru/">DotNext 2017</a> ). <br><br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/zz/zm/u3/zzzmu3lv-fc_qgszme3sxwm-gma.jpeg"></a> <br><br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/j9/7v/ph/j97vphvlnkhovnckbu923ect60u.jpeg"></a> <br><br><h3>  Second day reports </h3><br>  The reports of the second day were no less interesting than the reports of the first day. <br><br>  <b>Boot yourself, Spring is coming</b> <br>  <i>Kirill Tolkachev, Alpha Laboratory and Evgeny Borisov, Naya Technologies</i> <br><br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/qg/g6/ap/qgg6apszlyehoemjotxc9fcjnwk.jpeg"></a> <br><br>  Speaker tandem Cyril with Eugene has already proven himself previously excellent.  This time they performed a report on <a href="https://projects.spring.io/spring-boot/">Spring Boot</a> , which consisted of two parts.  The first and second parts were separated by a half-hour break. <br><br>  Speakers with great speed conveyed information to the audience, showing slides alternately with the code.  The audience liked the action - in both parts of the report the hall was full.  <a href="https://twitter.com/xpinjection/status/926728153522982912">The approving</a> report on the report of another conference speaker was not long in coming. <br><br>  <b>Amazon Alexa vs Google Home: The Big Battle of Voice Interfaces in Java</b> <br>  <i>Baruch Sadogursky, JFrog and Leonid Igolnik, CA Technologies</i> <br><br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/ka/o_/tq/kao_tqzeep7q_b57clhvb9xfq3m.jpeg"></a> <br><br>  The report was perceived as a continuation of the series begun by Baruch and Leonid at the <a href="https://devoops.ru/">DevOops</a> conference <a href="https://devoops.ru/">with</a> reports on <a href="https://devoops.ru/2017/spb/talks/5bapycqwxy44uc4yekcgqy/">this</a> and <a href="https://devoops.ru/2017/spb/talks/ezypljuyzygei6yeocsiq/">that</a> . <br><br>  The report was styled as a boxing match (looking closer, you can see white coats on the speakers), in which the referee was Anton Arkhipov.  <i>Amazon Alexa</i> (Leonid) and <i>Google Home</i> (Baruch) were compared in several rounds.  Excellent report, a lot of positive emotions from him and the audience, and the speakers themselves, I think. <br><br>  <b>Spring 5 / Reactor jet system design</b> <br>  <i>Maxim Gorelikov, Alpha Laboratory</i> <br><br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/uy/v-/wk/uyv-wkuispim2wjrj-ml_ogohei.jpeg"></a> <br><br>  Maxim spoke about reactive capabilities (integration of <i>Project Reactor</i> ) in <i>Spring 5</i> .  For example, several interconnected synchronous services were taken and the system was improved step by step using reactive approaches. <br><br>  Experiments clothed in code can be viewed <a href="https://github.com/gorelikov/cards-hub-evolution">on GitHub</a> . <br><br>  <b>TestContainers - integration testing with Docker</b> <br>  <i>Sergey Egorov, Uvita</i> <br><br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/84/nu/it/84nuitq5cwq9xigpkjftoenri1g.jpeg"></a> <br><br>  The report was announced by Sergey before the conference in one of the releases of the podcast <a href="http://razbor-poletov.com/">Debriefing</a> .  Intrigued by the announcement, listened with interest and looked. <br><br>  The goal of the <a href="https://github.com/testcontainers/testcontainers-java">TestContainers</a> library is to bring the test as close as <a href="https://github.com/testcontainers/testcontainers-java">possible</a> to the industrial environment in which the application will run.  The library is actively used by a number of well-known Java projects and companies (including <a href="https://zeroturnaround.com/">ZeroTurnaround</a> , where Sergey recently worked and where <i>TestContainers</i> just started <i>working</i> ). <br><br>  <b>Amber project: news from the fields</b> <br>  <i>Tagir Valeev, JetBrains</i> <br><br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/ow/cz/dp/owczdpigl2wsz44w_n2hcgjqvn0.jpeg"></a> <br><br>  The personal report of Tagir at the conference (except for the pair report with Baruch) was the story about the <a href="http://openjdk.java.net/projects/amber/">Amber Project</a> - a collection of various promising (or not so) opportunities that may appear in future releases of <i>Java</i> . <br><br>  In addition to the three <i>JEPs</i> listed on <a href="http://openjdk.java.net/projects/amber/">the project page</a> , <a href="http://openjdk.java.net/jeps/303">JEP 303</a> , <a href="http://openjdk.java.net/jeps/309">JEP 309</a> and <a href="http://openjdk.java.net/jeps/305">JEP 305</a> were mentioned.  Listeners of the report did not fail to <a href="https://twitter.com/iyambay/status/926817590835519490">quote</a> Tagir. <br><br>  <b>As we expanded the bottleneck of development</b> <br>  <i>Sergey Abdulmanov, Mosigra</i> <br><br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/02/iu/4y/02iu4y5ufldwhwfcknu29aulphc.jpeg"></a> <br><br>  The final conference was a report by Sergey <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/users/milfgard/" class="user_link">Milfgard</a> Abdulmanov - <i>Habrahabr</i> star, writing excellent articles and since 2010 working in the <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/company/mosigra/">Mosigra</a> company. <br><br>  It was told about the difficult way to scale when organizing the process of releasing board games.
