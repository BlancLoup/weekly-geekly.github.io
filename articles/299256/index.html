Various hypotheses are being built, models are being designed, budgets are considered, a great future is predicted, directions for the future development of things on the Internet are specified. <br>  I would like to add a bit of variety to this discussion and quote some interesting quotes from great people.  Immediately, I note that these quotes do not relate directly to IoT.  They were told about other things and at the time when the Internet was not yet in the project.  But they are really interesting, and in order to explain why they are so interesting with regard to the Internet of things, small comments have been added to them. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/d46/11c/77d/d4611c77da8d432f98fd42f4e4c89004.png"><br><h3>  Nikolai Yegorovich Zhukovsky in 1898: <blockquote>  "A man will fly, relying not on the strength of his muscles, but on the strength of his mind" </blockquote></h3><br>  The potential of the Internet of things is not in the performance and design features of equipment, sensors, controllers and other end devices connected by a single communications network, but in ideas and solutions, in technologies and models that can be realized with its help.  Only on how reasonable will the approach to the development of IoT depend on its future. <br><br>

A constant stream of generated data, conflicts of interest, disruption of interaction, inconsistency of goals, desynchronization of processes - this and much more is characteristic of large network communities.  There is something to work on. <br>  In the very quotation, F. Bradley rather scoffs at bureaucratic unproductive procedures.  But after all, the Internet of things basically must apply simple, but effective procedural regulations and standards.  ‚ÄúBuffering‚Äù IoT is easy enough, but what will it give for its development. <br><br><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/d46/11c/77d/d4611c77da8d432f98fd42f4e4c89004.png"><br><h3>  Herbert Spencer, in January 1858: <blockquote>  ‚ÄúMutual trust between notorious fraudsters who do not have, as they say, ni foi, ni loi, is impossible.  Mutual trust between people of unconditional honesty must be limitless. ‚Äù </blockquote></h3><br>  Interaction in the global information network is associated with various security issues and is subject to serious risks.  The active expansion of the quantity and quality of objects included in the constant information exchange, and even capable of independently implementing meaningful actions, sets unprecedented challenges for IoT technologies.  Among them are the following issues: <br>  - is it possible to include things into the network by any person or only those with certain powers? <br>  - what is allowed to do things online? <br>  - what powers can a thing have on the Internet? <br>  - who can manage interconnected network objects? <br>  - How to protect yourself from unauthorized access to separate networks and falsified things on the Internet that can impersonate others? <br>  - what risk events are possible with the Internet of things and how to eliminate them? <br>  Today there is no doubt that mutual direct declarative trust between things on the Internet is impossible.  Special safety standards and procedures are required. <br><br><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/d46/11c/77d/d4611c77da8d432f98fd42f4e4c89004.png"><br><h3>  Friedrich Nietzsche in 1886: <blockquote>  ‚ÄúIndependence is the lot of the few: it is an advantage of the strong.  And who encroaches on it, though with the fullest right, but unnecessarily, he proves that he is probably not only strong, but also dared to unbridledness. ‚Äù </blockquote></h3><br>  The Internet of Things is impossible in a limited business space.  This is a system that requires such extensive and diverse knowledge, tools, technologies, standards, research and practical skills that it is impossible to develop IoT outside the global coordinated community.  But after all, this means that certain advantages that a business receives from the Internet of things are not strictly competitive, because they are accessible to a wide range of stakeholders. <br><br><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/d46/11c/77d/d4611c77da8d432f98fd42f4e4c89004.png"><br><h3>  Elbert Green Hubbard at the beginning of the 20th century: <blockquote>  ‚ÄúOne machine can do the work of five ordinary people;  no car will do the work of one outstanding person " </blockquote></h3><br>  The most complex machines, mechanisms and automated systems require the participation of qualified and active professionals.  Therefore, it is not necessary to fear that everywhere a person will be replaced by robots or some sort of similar thing.  But do not forget about personal professional competitiveness - not worth it. <br><br><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/d46/11c/77d/d4611c77da8d432f98fd42f4e4c89004.png"><br><h3>  Friedrich Engels at the end of the 19th century: <blockquote>  ‚ÄúNo joint action is possible without imposing a certain number of people on someone else‚Äôs will, that is, without authority‚Äù </blockquote></h3><br>  The Internet of things will basically be shaped by market leaders.  The generation of ideas and their initial testing are possible in the framework of personal projects, startup businesses, corporate spin-offs, etc.  But in general, trends will be set by large corporations - which means they have a special responsibility for success in this difficult task.  In the face of increasing competition for investment resources, it is becoming more and more difficult to choose development priorities.  But it seems that the Internet of things is not threatened with attention deficit. <br><br><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/d46/11c/77d/d4611c77da8d432f98fd42f4e4c89004.png"><br><h3>  The hero of the film ‚ÄúMoscow Does Not Believe in Tears‚Äù (directed by Vladimir Menshov, scriptwriter Valentin Chernykh, 1979): <blockquote>  ‚ÄúTelevision will change the life of all mankind.  There will be nothing: no cinema, no theater, no books, no newspapers - one continuous television. ‚Äù </blockquote></h3><br>  The Internet of Things is one of the most important and advantageous competitive technologies.  It will press, but it will not replace other convenient and functional methods, procedures and systems.  Business will benefit from IoT just as much as it can competently and effectively use it.  In the end, there are many good and actively promoted tools and technologies that have occupied a decent niche in the market, but have not become a panacea.  Recall business process reengineering, big data, pipelined production, smart home technologies, total quality management, electronic document management, etc. <br><br><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/d46/11c/77d/d4611c77da8d432f98fd42f4e4c89004.png"><br><h3>  Mikhail Lomonosov in the XVIII century: <blockquote>  ‚ÄúHe who cannot be small cannot even be greater‚Äù </blockquote></h3><br>  A business that relies on the speedy resolution of its economic and managerial problems through the transition to IoT technologies will not receive the expected.  This is a really good reason to restructure the business model, but it is not a means of solving problems that are created by incompetent management, unqualified professionals and unmotivated employees.  By the way, there were already many such reasons and the business did not pay close attention to all of them. <br>  IoT does not solve problems, but transfers them to a higher level.  As well as automation does not reduce the amount of work and the number of employees, but allows you to do work at a higher level to more qualified specialists. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/299256/">https://habr.com/ru/post/299256/</a></p>
