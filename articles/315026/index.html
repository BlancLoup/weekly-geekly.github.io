Sleepless nights, a few cups of coffee every morning, stacks of pizza boxes and a pyramid of empty cans of power engineers - this is how the life of BI.ZONE developers for the last few months has looked.  No one felt sorry for himself to prepare the most interesting event held at the international conference on cyber security ZERONIGHTS 2016 - the competition Capture the Flag (CTF) from BI.ZONE. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Registration opened on the night of November 1, and literally immediately it became clear that the developers did not try in vain.  Before the competition even more than two weeks, but in the first few hours applications were received from many players from around the world.
