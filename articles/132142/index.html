  <section class="page js-page"><h1>IP registration experience for IT related business</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Once having decided to register as an entrepreneur, I ran into several unexpected problems that I can find almost no information about on the Internet.  A familiar accountant who advised me did not hear about such problems either, so I decided to write this topic to help my colleagues not to get into such a situation. <br>  The main points of the ‚Äúmandatory program‚Äù of registration are chewed on the Internet many times, but we will go over them anew, using our own experience.  I specifically will not give references to programs, forms of forms and resolutions, as they quickly become outdated and I don‚Äôt see any reason to upload them.  In addition, the accepted application in Tambov may not be accepted at another tax office, etc. <br>  Even in my case, there are no employees, it is important for the passage of the "quest". <br><a name="habracut"></a>  So, you need to do the following: <br>  1. Fill out the ‚ÄúApplication for state registration of an individual as an individual entrepreneur‚Äù in 2 copies.  There is nothing difficult, you just need to fill in your data and specify all activities in the OKVED directory.  I pointed out all the codes at 72, only 6 codes.  These are codes related to IT technologies.  Although it is possible, for example, some other codes may be required for cabling.  Selling something also in other codes, but I provide only services.  We <b>do not</b> sign the statement, he will be asked to sign with the inspector. <br>  2. Fill in the ‚ÄúApplication for the transition to a simplified taxation system (Form No. 26.2-1)‚Äù.  We print in 2 copies.  I chose a tax of 6% on turnover. <br>  3. We pay the state duty in the amount of 800 rubles for the registration of IP.  Details of your inspection is on the tax website. <br>  4. You can go to the tax and apply first for registration, then immediately go to the simplified text. <br>  5. At the appointed time we come to receive a certificate and an extract.  We check everything to the letter.  In my case, there was a typo in the address.  Penalty for typo in the statement 5000r.  Be careful.  I was lucky, fixed for free. <br>  6. Pension is automatically notified of tax.  There remains the statistics office, in which you need to appear with your certificate and a copy of the 2 main pages of your passport.  You will be given a certificate. <br><br>  Next comes the optional program, but if you plan to work with organizations and by bank transfer, you will most likely need it too. <br>  7. Order a seal. <br>  8. With the seal and all the documents that are already available, we arrive at the bank of your choice to open an account.  In my case, it was Sberbank.  Why sber?  Out of habit.  And my friends have experience with them, they have already helped to understand their online client bank. <br>  9. Fill out the application for registration of an account in the bank and refer to the tax.  This item is not done on time, now I‚Äôm waiting for a fine.  By default it is 5000r, but they promised to reduce it to 1000r if I write a petition to the head. <br>  10. Similarly, we notify the pension fund about opening an account. <br>  And now the most interesting about what did not find any information on the Internet. <br>  11. Notify Rospotrebnadzor about the start of business activities.  Then I still give a <a href="http://68.rospotrebnadzor.ru/documents/postanovlenia/9321/">link</a> , then you can go to the rules and so on.  In this office you need to register only if your activity falls under their list, in my case I got the code "Maintenance and repair of office machines and computing equipment, including cash register 72.5 *".  Just about this moment did not know any of their friends, they did not say in the tax, although I asked.  Must assign a fine for late payment, now I will go to surrender.  Calling them for comments was not easy. <br><br>  I hope you do not repeat my mistakes, good luck in business.
