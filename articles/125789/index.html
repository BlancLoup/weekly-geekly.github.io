Ridiculous and useful, impossible and quite doable.  For example, such as the age requirement for acquiring Left 4 Dead 2. In the US, the game will be sold to those who are eighteen years old, in Russia it is allowed to prepare for a zombie attack from sixteen (but for a real 450 rubles a seven-year "player" will be given a box) and in Australia and in some other countries, as far as I know, L4D2 was banned in principle. <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  Invented and realized for adults and people who are almost mentally formed, the world of L4D2 is teeming with hesitant children, who squeaky with their voices shout "kill the hunter, kill the hunter b &amp;% $ b !!!".  Their characters always run forward, get into various modifications, from which they simply cannot get out alone, and then these unfortunate players shout their voice calls to other party members.  Reproaching those for not coming in time.

      I play L4D2 for the sake of pleasure, in order to relax and feel myself in some kind of, but surviving in the most terrible trouble of the team.  I‚Äôm not trying to go through the next level totally and quickly and feel ‚Äúsafe for a while‚Äù while the new location is loading.  The process itself is interesting.  I don't need to run away from scary monsters.  On the contrary, they should be ‚Äúdusty-dy-dy-dysch-tysch-tysch‚Äù, and to pieces, with intestines and cerebellum, beautifully flying off somewhere behind the back of the hero under my control.  Those players who see the game as a game and just another entertainment, and not like life, behave in the same way. <br><br>  Age restrictions are not just entered.  This is a rule scientifically proven by all sorts of ‚Äúpsychiatrists‚Äù that is worth fulfilling.  I don‚Äôt know how doctors determine dependence and influence, but the game world of Left 4 Dead 2 is an excellent space to separate people who are able to resist the ‚Äúconfusion‚Äù from those who are not inclined to do so. <br><br>  An adult in a game behaves like a game.  He is calm and determined.  He goes slowly, trying to keep the other members of the group.  He cleans and inspects every corner, without losing anything that can somehow help him and other "living".  He does not kill out of need, like animals, but out of interest.  Psychologists often call this a deviation.  But such behavior can only be considered a deviation if the action takes place in real life.  And here the game is, and the player understands that he will not take the shotgun in his hands and will not go shooting left and right in the city.  However, I will not go into details, otherwise there is a real threat to get stuck in this not so familiar swamp to me.  I'll be back to the kids. <br><br>  They behave in the game in the same way they behave in life.  And this is bad for everyone.  Eleven- and twelve-year-old boys either stand still, beating in some secluded place, or run forward, squirting adrenaline into the blood both in the game and in life.  Fear has big eyes, and with its behavior they feed this fear even more, fleeing where they look and imagining how the most dangerous zombies are chasing them.  They do not have the time or the desire to turn around and help others in such moments.  And having reached the saving shelter, these geniuses close behind themselves all the doors that can only be closed.  No, I do not make a claim to them for this, it is just not for this that most still come to L4D2.  It's good that most of the players still do not need another real world, but rest and relaxation from ours with you. <br><br>  In the end, I would like to say that I finally understood the meaning of age qualifications for games.  This is a real and necessary thing, even from the point of view of the fan that other players will receive from the process.  And I would very much like to know what other opinions on this matter? </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/125789/">https://habr.com/ru/post/125789/</a></p>
