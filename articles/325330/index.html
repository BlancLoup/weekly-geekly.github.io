  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Security Watch: IBM QRadar SIEM</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Modern cybercriminals use more sophisticated methods when attacking companies ‚Äôsecurity systems.  To counteract them, the departments of information security are forced to analyze and interpret a huge number of events per day.  IBM's security defense for network security offers an IBM QRadar Security Intelligence Platform solution that provides a unified architecture for integrating security information and event management (SIEM) and logging, anomalous situation detection, incident analysis, response management, vulnerability management and management. . <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/f50/f82/96e/f50f8296e3694a5980ef146e9d2ca2a3.png" alt="image"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  The unified architecture of QRadar Security Intelligence Platform allows you to analyze logs, network streams, packets, vulnerabilities, as well as user and resource data.  Using Sense Analytics allows you to perform correlation analysis to identify the most serious threats, attacks and vulnerabilities in real time.  This enables IT departments to prioritize and highlight the most important incidents from the huge data stream.  The solution automatically responds to incidents and fulfills regulatory requirements due to the possibilities of data collection, determining their correlation and reporting.  It also provides a predictive analysis of the existing risks caused by incorrect device configuration and known vulnerabilities. <br><br><h3>  Threat Analyzer </h3><br>  The IBM QRadar Security Intelligence Platform includes a variety of different modules.  One of the key components of the solution is the IBM QRadar SIEM tool - a system for collecting and analyzing events.  It consolidates information from event logs from devices, endpoints, and applications on the network.  QRadar SIEM normalizes and analyzes the correlation to identify security threats, and also uses the advanced Sense Analytics mechanism to detect normal behavior, detect anomalies, uncover advanced threats, and remove false-positive results.  This software module allows you to collect all related events in one incident.  QRadar SIEM can include IBM X-Force Threat Intelligence threat analysis tools with a list of potentially malicious IP addresses, addresses of computers with malware, sources of spam, and other threats, allowing you to implement a proactive approach to security.  In addition, to prioritize, the product can match threats to systems with events and data from the network.

      The ability to create detailed reports on data access and user actions provides more effective threat management and standards compliance.  It is also worth mentioning that QRadar SIEM can be used in local and cloud environments. <br><br>  In addition, it is worth noting that IBM is planning to use the Watson security platform in the near future, integrating it with the QRadar software and the X-Force database.  This will increase the level of analytics to determine the nature of threats, as well as compensate for the lack of IT staff in the field of information security. <br><br><h3>  Functionality issues </h3><br>  Consider the above IBM QRadar SIEM features in more detail.  Providing real-time transparency allows you to detect misuse of applications, internal fraud and small threats that could be overlooked among the millions of events that occur daily.  The solution allows for the collection of logs and events from various sources, including security devices, operating systems, applications, databases, and access and identification control systems.  Network flow data comes from switches and routers, including Layer 7 data (application layer).  It provides information from access control and identification systems and infrastructure services such as Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP), as well as from vulnerability scanners in networks and applications. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/0b7/a3c/392/0b7a3c392fef45d694a2df611eff6fd1.jpg" alt="image"><br>  <i>On the IBM QRadar SIEM Dashboard you can display all necessary reports and charts.</i> <br><br>  QRadar SIEM performs instant event normalization and comparison with other data to detect threats and generate regulatory reports.  The decision determines the priorities of events, highlighting a small number of real violations that carry the most serious threat to the business.  The detected anomalies provide an opportunity to identify changes in behavior associated with applications, computers, users and network segments.  Using IBM X-Force Threat Intelligence software also identifies actions related to suspicious IP addresses. <br><br>  The solution provides the ability to more effectively manage threats by tracking serious incidents and providing links to all the required data for analysis.  This allows you to detect activities during off-hours or unusual use of applications and cloud services, as well as network activity that does not match the saved usage patterns.  To improve analytics, QRadar SIEM supports the ability to search in events and data streams in near real-time mode, as well as from stored data.  You can perform a combined search in large distributed environments.  You can use IBM QRadar QFlow and IBM QRadar VFlow Collector devices to provide detailed analysis of network flows at level 7 for a deeper understanding and better display of applications, databases, products for collaboration and social networks. <br><br>  The ability to install in the cloud SoftLayer allows QRadar SIEM to receive real-time security information in cloud environments.  Moreover, the collection of events and data streams from applications is performed both in the cloud and on local resources. <br><br>  The solution has an intuitive reporting module that does not require special databases or special skills from IT administrators.  Creating reports on data access and user activity with the ability to track information by name and IP address ensures compliance with security policies and regulatory compliance. <br><br><h3>  Related components </h3><br>  The QRadar SIEM tool integrates a number of modules that increase its efficiency.  One of the most important is QRadar Risk Manager, which compares vulnerability information with network topology and connection data.  The solution identifies vulnerabilities in the company's network and applications running in it, assessing the risks and minimizing them.  Risk Manager monitors the configuration of switches, routers, firewalls and intrusion prevention systems (IPS), recognizing conditions that pose a security risk.  In addition, it allows you to simulate network attacks and other intrusion scenarios, making changes to the network configuration that make it possible to assess the scale of the threat. <br><br>  Another interesting tool is the QRadar Log Manager module.  It collects and processes real-time event data from routers, switches, firewalls, VPNs, intrusion detection and prevention systems (IDS / IPS), antivirus programs, and other sources.  Log Manager makes it possible to simplify the maintenance of the necessary reporting and control over compliance with regulatory requirements. <br><br><h3>  As an afterword </h3><br>  IBM QRadar SIEM is one of the most effective analytical security systems.  It is also important that the solution supports work with more than 200 products from leading manufacturers and collects, analyzes and correlates data across a wide range of systems, including network solutions, security tools, servers, hosts, operating systems and applications.  In addition, an additional advantage of the solution is the low cost of an entry-level system. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/325330/">https://habr.com/ru/post/325330/</a></p>
