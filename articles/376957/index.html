  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Cash Bitcoin at a good rate in Thailand</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Post not advertising service, but the joy for the gradual integration of cryptocurrency in life.  Recently, I wondered if it is possible to withdraw bitcoins to cash quickly and conveniently in Thailand.  And there was a service that does it at good rates and within just a couple of hours, and you can get cash at any ATM of a blue bank without any card, just by code.  I share with you the instruction-photo report. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/5f4/ca8/fa7/5f4ca8fa74ac42d0be79e16b3d331d34.jpg"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  Go to <a href="https://bitcoin.co.th/en/">bitcoin.co.th/en</a> and immediately see the form "Sell BTC".  The service is open from 6 am to 8 pm local Thai time. <br>  The ATM withdrawal fee is 30 baht, and the amount is rounded up to 100 baht (probably due to the lack of small bills at ATMs), so I enter 5030 THB to get exactly 5000.

    <img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/575/ed5/02e/575ed502ebfb4131bb221cb71875f616.png"><br><br>  Fill out the application.  I take a screenshot, doing it for the second time, so I immediately under my account.  For new users is a simple registration.  In the application form, select "Cash at KTB ATM" and where to send the notification with the code. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/4e6/bb9/437/4e6bb94377b24c4d816143714ab20e48.png"><br><br>  According to current Thai laws, they also want a photo or scan of your ID.  I don‚Äôt know how thoroughly they check this information, but I just took a photo of my Thai rider on the phone. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/714/298/680/714298680f034faea4a20ad46ff18bbe.png"><br><br>  We get the address to transfer the required amount in bitcoins.  The transfer must be made within 15 minutes, otherwise the application will be canceled.  This is because of the possible changes in the market, the exchanger is constantly adjusting to the current market situation and does not want to be in the red, of course. <br><br>  The address of this page is the permanent address of our application, where you can see the status of payment and the necessary REF # 1 code. <br><br>  I will explain about the codes.  In the ATM Krung Thai Bank you will need to enter two codes: REF # 1 and REF # 2.  The service sends us a mail with the notification code REF # 1 and also displays it on the page of our application.  The REF # 2 code is sent to us by the Krung Thai Bank itself to the specified mail or phone.  This time I decided to request for a phone - they send an SMS. <br><br>  Making a payment: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/b2a/046/2e9/b2a0462e9baf4bd9a559811e31fa03df.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/95b/348/a8f/95b348a8fd9e46408328332eb2720aae.jpg"><br><br>  We update the page and see that the service saw our payment (you can not wait for confirmation of the transaction, they see the transfer right away). <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/e5c/a65/e26/e5ca65e26a084f1ebc0e65ec9faebb97.png"><br><br>  Everything.  Now we are waiting for the application process and send us the codes.  It usually takes from one to several hours.  Two hours later I received this letter from the service with REF code # 1: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/f41/1c2/1e6/f411c21e69c94a1ba29a786ac12b76e3.jpg"><br><br>  From the bank received an SMS with REF code # 2: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/7bc/551/4a9/7bc5514a99964ae0b059b9f6fed06b00.jpg"><br><br>  All is ready!  Now we go to look for an ATM.  Krung Thai Bank (KTB) is the so-called Blue Bank.  In Thailand, there are a number of major banks that differ primarily in corporate color, by which they are used to identify them.  Found a bank with an ATM: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/7e9/2d8/39e/7e92d839e596490a83c1a9cd82095ebc.jpg"><br><br>  You can find a similarly standing ATM, for example, near some 7-Eleven stores. <br><br>  We press the right bottom button, where it is written that we want to work without a map: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/307/4f5/7d5/3074f57d560f47839fbdc719d4a35168.jpg"><br><br>  It turned out that if you shoot the process on the phone, holding it in your left hand, then it is very difficult to get ungreased photos.  So I changed hands :) <br><br>  Enter REF # 1 and REF # 2, which were sent to us by the service and bank: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/78a/77e/962/78a77e962bbb4903b85634210dd8f676.jpg"><br><br>  We are checking.  5000 baht, that's right, I requested so much.  We confirm: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/e82/85d/e73/e8285de73df3466f980d9fd9d692f677.jpg"><br><br>  Everything, the ATM counts bills: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/f90/97c/4fb/f9097c4fb5054b2e87a4c5eb55cdf641.jpg"><br><br>  Done! <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/5f4/ca8/fa7/5f4ca8fa74ac42d0be79e16b3d331d34.jpg"><br><br>  This is how simple, fast and almost anywhere in the country.  There are KTB ATMs in almost every region of Thailand (I traveled around the country, I was convinced).  You can send these codes to your poor family or artist to Thailand without bothering them at all with bitcoin.  Alternatively, if you yourself are in Thailand, like me, you can comfortably accept payment for work in bitcoins by cash out in this way. <br><br>  Losses are about the following.  Courses on the site at the time of writing: 7641 baht for sale, 8222 for purchase.  The difference is 7.6%, that is, the sale is obtained by 3-4% below the market.  Plus 30 baht commission for withdrawal through an ATM.  Total: 30 baht + 3-4%. <br><br>  It can be compared with the withdrawal of money from odesk: 10% commission odesk + $ 30 for a single SWIFT transfer operation.  And also a hold of money on odeske in the area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe week plus a few working days until SWIFT comes. <br>  I now hesitate between taking payments from customers through odesk, losing a lot on commissions, but pumping my profile history, and taking payments from them in bitcoins, which I will incomparably faster and cheaper put into cash baht. <br><br>  PS: Well, for the sake of justice, one should not forget to mention <a href="http://localbitcoins.com/">localbitcoins.com</a> - there, probably, you can find better conditions if you wish, but most likely the process will take more time. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/376957/">https://habr.com/ru/post/376957/</a></p>
