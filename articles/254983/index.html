It shows a reduced version of the last open screen, although it would be more useful to replace it with the squeeze of fresh information from the application. <br><br>  <strong><a href="http://www.likeni.ru/events/Infografika-SHpargalka-po-razmeram-graficheskikh-elementov-v-sotsialnykh-setyakh/">Infographics: Cheat sheet on the size of graphic elements in social networks</a></strong> <br>  Detailed cheat sheet on the size of graphic elements in social networks.

He offers several improvements for him, allowing to solve two main problems - some characters are not visible, and the user does not always remember where the next letter he needs is located.  The decision is controversial, but interesting. <br><br>  <strong><a href="http://www.smashingmagazine.com/2015/03/16/web-accessibility-with-accessibility-api/">Accessibility APIs: A Key To Web Accessibility</a></strong> <br>  About the technical aspects of creating an accessible environment in a web browser and a little about the history of the issue.  On the one hand, the article is for techies, but usability should be an interdisciplinary field.  Without an understanding of the limitations or opportunities that technology presents to us, effective work is impossible.  And in this article it is very clearly explained what you can pay attention to when working on the accessibility of the web environment. <br><br>  <strong>Animation patterns in known applications</strong> <br><ul><li>  <a href="http://blog.brianlovin.com/design-details-tumblr-for-ios/">Tumblr for iOS</a> . </li><li>  <a href="https://medium.com/%40emieljanson/blendle-trending-design-details-61c5c64ac6aa">Blendle Trending for iOS</a> . </li></ul><br><br>  <strong><a href="http://www.nngroup.com/articles/clickable-elements/">Beyond Blue Links - Making Clickable Elements Recognizable</a></strong> <br>  Hoa Loraner lists the rules for the selection of interactive elements in the interface. <br><br>  <strong><a href="https://niice.co/ios">Niice - A search engine with taste</a></strong> <br>  Niice app for iOS, tool for creating mindboards, has been released. <br><br>  <strong><a href="http://www.measuringu.com/blog/affinity-analysis.php">Customers Who Bought This‚Ä¶ Affinity Analysis Explained</a></strong> <br>  Jeff Sauro on how the formula offers similar products in online stores.

For example, the appearance of error messages or success, filtering results. <br><br>  <strong><a href="http://www.uxmatters.com/mt/archives/2015/03/understanding-context-environment-language-and-information-architecture.php">Understanding Context: Environment, Language, and Information Architecture</a></strong> <br>  An excerpt from Andrew Hinton‚Äôs Understanding Context: Environment, Language, and Information Architecture.

For optimal results, you need to keep a balance between empathizing the user and observing user experiences from an impartial point of view.  Both extremes do not lead to better results.  Continuing the theme: <br><ul><li>  An interesting approach to the development of empathy with designers and developers.  <a href="http://whatdoesmysitecost.com/">The service considers the weight of the site pages in the money of different countries, how much it will cost to visit</a> . </li></ul><br><br>  <strong>Design for the elderly</strong> <br><ul><li>  <a href="http://www.today.com/money/age-not-barrier-tech-designer-91-lands-her-dream-job-2D80518851">Video about Barbara Beskind, 91-year-old IDEO designer</a> . </li></ul><br><br><h2>  Information architecture, conceptual design, content strategy </h2><br>  <strong><a href="http://cardsort.ignorethecode.net/">Card generator</a></strong> <br>  A simple online service for preparing card sorting from Lukas Mathis.

The basis is not much different from other similar tools, but in practice very pleasant solutions in the details.  And most importantly - you can throw in the developments in InDesign, Photoshop or Illustrator for further refinement.  Well, in general, it is built on Adobe technology, which means it is perfectly tied to other services - including Typekit.  <a href="http://www.subtraction.com/2015/03/30/layup-is-now-adobe-comp-cc/">Khoi Vinh participated</a> in its creation. <br><br>  <strong><a href="https://medium.com/%40almonk/design-like-it-s-1999-48ce5f5be14">Bind - Building an experimental UI design tool</a></strong> <br>  Alastair Monk makes his tool for designers Bind.
