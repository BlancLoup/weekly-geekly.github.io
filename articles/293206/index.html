In my opinion, this is great.  A change of scenery perfectly tones, saves from the routine, gives new ideas and inspiration.  If you are working remotely, as we are at <a href="http://alconost.com/%3Futm_source%3Dhabrahabr%26utm_medium%3Darticle%26utm_campaign%3Down_article%26utm_content%3DCafeworking">Alconost</a> , coffeworking is a great alternative to coworking - why pay hourly for a chair and table when you get the same thing and in addition to a delicious breakfast or lunch.  Cafes also help out during travel, business trips, interruptions to the Internet or with electricity in your workplace.  And in fine days it is especially pleasant to get settled in the shade of a summer playground, to breathe fresh air and drink flavored tea with Google Docs while the others are sweating in four walls. <br><br> <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/company/alconost/blog/293206/"><img width="800" src="https://habrastorage.org/files/c61/e06/8a4/c61e068a4cde41b49051ce4ebb1b701c.jpg"></a> <br><br>  Like?

    <h3>  <font color="#0096d6"><b>Getting ready for work</b></font> </h3><br>  Immediately make a reservation: it is hardly possible to spend a full day in a cafe.  As a rule, it is inconvenient to you or the institution.  If such a need arises, it is better to work in two cafes for 4 hours in each, with good stretching of the legs during the break. <br><br>  Before you grab a laptop under your arm and go to conquer the peaks of kawevorkinga, you should make sure that your device is fully charged, and charging or a spare battery is taken with you.  A wireless mouse and a 3G modem can also be very useful. <br><br>  If you go to a cafe alone, consider visiting WC before your order is brought to you.  If you go to a cafe is not one - think about whether you can work at all :) <br><br>  One more thing: it may be unusual at first to tune in to the working mode in such conditions.  Although let's be honest, it‚Äôs more difficult to concentrate in a noisy openspace.  For example, I write in a cafe perfectly.  But I prefer to work with numbers in complete silence. <br><br>  Restrictions imposes not only the environment, but also your device.  Even Cap knows that for certain types of work you need a large monitor, a powerful desktop computer or additional devices like a graphics tablet.  And Cap suggests that in this situation it is better not to go to a cafe. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/d0a/f01/2df/d0af012dfbf743a08f78779aee98c657.jpg"><br><br><h3>  <font color="#0096d6"><b>Choosing an institution</b></font> </h3><br>  Do not get attached prematurely to one place until you find where you like most.  Pay attention to the music that plays in this place, the comfort of the seats, on the menu, after all.  Is there a cozy place away from the passage?  Are there sockets near the tables if you have to stay longer?  How crowded is it?  What about smokers? <br><br>  Super-popular places like McDonalds are usually not the best choice.  In general, do not become attached to the same format - not only cafes, but restaurants, coffee shops, bars, in general, any island with Wi-Fi can be an excellent option.  Check out reviews on services like Foursquare to determine which ones are worth paying attention to. <br><br>  Speaking of Wi-Fi.  It happens that in the institution of regular interruptions to the Internet or coverage is only enough for part of the tables.  Often this can only be determined experimentally. <br><br>  Anyway, in the new place do not plan any urgent tasks.  It will relieve you from experiences in the event that something goes wrong. <br><br>  A good option - to start, just go in and have a cup of coffee.  After half an hour of careful observation, you will be able to determine for yourself whether you want to spend several creative hours here. <br><br><img title="BFI MOMI Cafe" alt="BFI MOMI Cafe" src="https://habrastorage.org/files/9b6/379/504/9b63795045d94a2e89a36c59ec239ed9.jpg"><br>  <font color="#999"><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/anotherphotograph/512700577/"><i>Tony Hall, BFI MOMI Cafe</i></a></font> <br><br><h3>  <font color="#0096d6"><b>Etiquette caffeworking</b></font> </h3><br>  And here you are and your laptop is in the right place.  What's next? <br><br><ul><li>  Do not occupy a table designed for a large company, even if it is now free. </li><li>  Use headphones if you need to listen to audio. </li><li>  Avoid lengthy phone calls and loud skype calls.  By the way, people in headphones often sin with this - after all, they hear themselves badly. </li><li>  Buy drinks and food every couple of hours.  Something edible should always be on your table, and it is better that these were not three sticks of french fries, a lonely portion of which you ordered three hours ago. </li><li>  Usually the busiest time in a cafe is the time for business lunches and after 18.00.  It is better to choose the time before or immediately after lunch, when there are fewer visitors in the establishment, and the waiters are not so worried about the free tables.  For example, I like to go to a cafe for breakfast - from 9 to 11 in the morning, and then additionally order drinks and desserts, if you need to work for another hour or two. </li><li>  Be friendly with the waiters and leave a tip. </li></ul><br>  Have a good kafeworking! <br><br>  <b>Have you tried working in a cafe?</b> <br><br><br>  <b>about the author</b> <br><br>  Alconost is engaged in the <a href="https://alconost.com/services/software-localization%3Futm_source%3Dhabrahabr%26utm_medium%3Darticle%26utm_campaign%3Down_article%26utm_content%3Dyoutube">localization of applications, games and websites</a> in 60 languages.
