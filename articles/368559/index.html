We, as always, could not stay away from such a scale, and took part in organizing the festival with the efforts of the entire <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/company/makeitlab/profile/">MakeItLab hackspace</a> . <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/09e/6a4/6b3/09e6a46b3b7b4e928b01281dbec4ab9b.jpg"><br><br>  A year ago, we already <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/company/makeitlab/blog/249781/">wrote about technology-making</a> in our blog on Habr√©.  Then, at the main event of the festival - tehnonoch, gathered about a thousand visitors.  For all the organizers of the festival, this became a sign that we all do a good job, which brings together many curious children and adults under one idea.

      The festival is an attempt to bring together all the technical activities for children in our area.  Trying to make a truly mass event to show as many children as possible that being an engineer in our time is very cool.  This year tehnonoch gathered about two thousand people! <br><br>  Under the cut report on this great event, with a bunch of illustrative photos and comments. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  In 28 days, 56 various events were held, from photo contests and quest games, to artificial intelligence seminars and quadcopter assembly workshops.  All activities took place in different locations of the city, the benefit of the festival every year more and more friends.  One of these locations was our hackspace, in which we held a masterclass on programming address garlands on RPi and python.  The main event of the festival - technonoch, took place in the new cultural space of our city - in the Yeltsin center. <br><br>  The main ideologist of the festival is Irina Zakirova and her non-profit organization New Education Club.  Reseda Rybalko - curator of the event.  These are the people who were able to put together without a million a lot of events purely on a voluntary basis.  This is generally nonsense in our time, but as practice shows, "sense" is still there.  It will be megacut, if someone is inspired by what is happening in our city and dares to repeat it at home! <br><br>  It is difficult to trample so many events in one article, so let's try to run over the most key of them.  Traditionally, the opening of the City of technological creativity took place on February 2 and was marked by the ignition of symbolic stars, which personified the wishes of all the organizers.  Everyone had to finish the phrase ‚ÄúLet it be ...‚Äù and zamknut to free light :) At the closing of the festival, all these stars will be extinguished to go out for exactly one year. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/319/673/ba4/319673ba4b0046d293b2521e83a6b4f2.jpg"><br><br>  There was a bit of entertainment, including a jazz orchestra and FPV quadrocopter flights.  The opening was held at the National Center for Contemporary Art.  In general, modern art and technology are very closely related, so the NCCA are our good friends. <br><br>  From the 4th, the series of main events began with youth debates with the participation of top officials of regional education and the traditional ‚ÄúInventory‚Äù - a sort of TRIZ for children from Professor Sergei Arkadyevich Novoselov. <br><br>  The next day, the finals of photographic and technical contests were held, as well as a master-class on CNC programming of machine tools, which was held on the basis of the Ural State University of Communications.  For this many thanks to Vladimir Makarov, the head of the local Fab-lab. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/b49/e0a/fab/b49e0afabce54411ad4e2e6c25c95d7b.jpg"><br><br>  On February 6, Stanislav Samodelkin conducted two workshops on creating an ARK generator for Tony Stark and the BAT signal.  The participants were delighted! <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/3a2/a7c/10e/3a2a7c10e9284ee786439079e9562157.jpg"><br><br>  Group Tony Starkov: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/e06/533/7b0/e065337b0bbc4034ba06c70e6e71dd7a.jpg"><br><br>  Summon Batman: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/4f6/d19/394/4f6d193943c1448c803fea274969cd6f.jpg"><br><br>  On the same day, night gatherings of young engineers took place - a series of lectures and master classes at the Ural State Pedagogical University. <br><br>  February 9th was dedicated to aviation.  The first masterclass was held in the house of creativity of the Oktyabrsky district, where the guys collected and launched models of gliders.  Later in the evening, a drone workshop was held, which smoothly passed into a quadrocopter masterclass.  Taras Shevchenko showed how in two hours to bring together all the parts of the helicopter, and bring it to life. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/70b/35f/bfa/70b35fbfa63a4370b23a3a466aa29d1d.jpg"><br><br>  The day ended with the popular science show ‚ÄúWe Disassemble into Atoms,‚Äù in which three research associates explained what the genetic code is. <br><br>  The next day is a new masterclass.  In our hackspace, the guys tried their hand at programming the address garland based on the Raspberry Pi.  I must say, we have developed this course quite recently, and it was interesting how the schoolchildren will react to such a stand. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/150/3c4/054/1503c40540914ac692017171e26d00e0.jpg"><br><br>  Moving on.  On February 12, six events took place at once in various schools and centers of creativity of the city.  There were lessons on programming Arduino, on robotics on different platforms, as well as masterclasses on 3D printing. <br><br>  Finally, on the 13th, the main event of the festival took place - technonoch.  Under the roof of the Yeltsin Center there were a lot of entertaining activities, which anyone could take part in.  Here for example the interactive sandbox of our hackspace, which each time attracts a lot of children and adults.  They say that calms the nerves. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/9fe/d28/24c/9fed2824c3ea4097bd20450ae4667aff.JPG"><br><br>  Another interesting device is a thermal imager.  We put a big TV so that visitors could look at themselves through the eyes of the Predator :) <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/fa1/0df/776/fa10df77609442deab6ed27c5997e1a6.JPG"><br><br>  In general, many technical communities of the city brought a piece of their artifacts to tehnonoch.  The radio engineering college is famous for its rovers, which makes the tireless robot technician Sergey Grishchenko. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/e9f/46d/e22/e9f46de2263441cca91dbafb164ebcb6.jpg"><br><br>  And Tesla coils. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/177/d0c/df4/177d0cdf448f4557a38929921ea360a4.jpg"><br><br>  There was also a quadcopter, which barazhirov on the building in the company of the most outstanding operator. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/9da/217/10f/9da21710f29840f889f0cb1565080504.jpg"><br><br>  Polytechnic college students told schoolchildren what a 3D printer is: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/f44/12c/caf/f4412ccaffa94cc997986a16039af336.jpg"><br><br>  There were many interesting stands of various educational organizations of the city.  Everything could be touched and pressed. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/d2b/1dd/633/d2b1dd63305c4da9b601c6e290d1d6d8.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/aea/329/8f0/aea3298f051247a9a0ecc0689af84307.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/5ff/ff2/13a/5ffff213a6bf467b9e494fd41241cea9.jpg"><br><br>  And here, for example, a masterclass on assembling buildings from minikirpichikov. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/0ed/dbd/1e3/0eddbd1e33324820ae9afd88cdf4bc92.jpg"><br><br>  The guys collected gliders, and launched them right in the huge atrium of the Yeltsin Center.  All gliders have found their targets! <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/320/8bb/418/3208bb41803a429daa29e62fe40a3ee0.jpg"><br><br>  There were masterclasses for the little ones: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/ed8/d9a/847/ed8d9a847a7d422bb664d1e57faf8150.jpg"><br><br>  Older ones made robots: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/8c0/1e6/66a/8c01e666affa4201baf12cc66ebdeef0.jpg"><br><br>  Or collected wooden structures: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/497/fcd/c43/497fcdc43083455c9f95f7494c39cd19.jpg"><br><br>  Finally, various lectures and awards for past competitions were permanently performed on the main stage: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/ccb/554/a3b/ccb554a3b796478b939625792d5f17c6.jpg"><br><br>  In general, the main goal of the technology was achieved - all the children were able to touch the technology and felt themselves involved in the engineering!  The festival did not end there, although initially it was planned to close on the 13th.  There were so many people who wanted to participate in the City of Technological Creativity that they had to move the dates of the festival for 14 days! <br><br>  During these 14 days, many more masterclasses, competitions, contests, excursions and quests have passed.  Take, at least, the competition of design projects - the first competition of a regional scale in prototyping.  After the correspondence stage, at which the guys prepared 3D-models of famous buildings in their home cities, the task was set to design, print and assemble different devices.  An example of homework - a ready-made gadget for training the eye gauge: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/e21/e83/3f0/e21e833f01054ed5bcbad0492946629e.jpg"><br><br>  But the result of a full-time competition for the older group: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/267/24d/ca2/26724dca2bd743eaaacbbba4412c6952.jpg"><br><br>  Everyone knows that it‚Äôs a real pleasure for any techie to assemble parts into a working device :) In general, it‚Äôs pleasant to understand that the younger generation already knows how to use the most modern technologies. <br><br>  <b>In custody</b> <br><br>  Once again, in one article it‚Äôs impossible to fully convey the spirit of the festival.  So many cool events that at the time of writing articles about each.  Actually, we'll write about some of them for sure.  And I hope that I managed to at least inspire someone to repeat this in their own regions. <br><br>  I remind you that all participants of the festival acted on a voluntary basis.  Not a single cosmillion was spent.  Of course, it was not possible to completely do without investments: somewhere you need to rent a room, where you can get chairs, feed the children, but this is all within reasonable limits.  It would be great to find mutual understanding with sponsors and to move the annual event to a higher level.  Looking forward to next year! <br><br>  Festival programs with descriptions and photos can be found on the <a href="http://tehnotvorchestvo.ru/2016">official website</a> . </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/368559/">https://habr.com/ru/post/368559/</a></p>
