And just the other day, with a difference of 731 Earth day, the third galaxy was discovered - <b><a href="http://edugalaxy.intel.ru/index.php">Intel EduGalaxy</a></b> .

      According to the creators, the resource should be a convenient platform for discussing educational projects of Intel.  And by and large - this is the first major professional online community for teachers, which should bring together all interested people involved in the future of education in the light of the use of new information technologies. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/7e9/f82/48d/7e9f8248d3e39bcb341e17ee2b40dfcd.jpg" alt="image"><br>  Translator, <b>Shelley Shott</b> (Director of Intel's Global Training for the Future program), <b>Vera Baklashova</b> (Director of Intel Education Programs in the CIS) and <b>Yaroslav Bykhovsky</b> (Business Development Manager of Intel Education in the CIS). <br><br>  Shelley spoke about the role of educational processes in a person‚Äôs life, about the new Intel project and about its components, as well as just about the contribution of Intel to education.  For example, the company has invested more than $ 1 billion in total in various educational programs, where Russia alone accounted for more than $ 15 million. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/eae/471/dc1/eae471dc1d317d4b7dae6d41ee7e63f1.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  ‚Äú <i>Yesterday I told a group of teachers about my two children.</i>  <i>My eldest son will retire around 2060.</i>  <i>According to some estimates, in his life he will replace about 15 different professions.</i>  <i>Perhaps some of these professions do not yet exist.</i>  <i>It is very important today to teach him to adapt and learn, to accept new knowledge and put it into practice.</i>  <i>Intel‚Äôs educational programs are focused on this ‚Äî we help children acquire the skills of the 21st century.</i>  " <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/326/8cf/c54/3268cfc5449459ef2aef013e55908131.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  In fact, the new galaxy is the single entry point for all educational projects that were previously launched by Intel.  Among them - " <b>Education for the Future</b> ", a global program for professionals in the field of education;  This is the most successful program of its kind on a global scale.  Over 7 million people in 60 countries of the world - from young teachers to real veterans;  Since 2001, more than 650 thousand (!) teachers have been trained in this country in our country. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/cc7/570/fda/cc7570fda56f8b43d84ffc67a64b68ea.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Since 1997, more than 500 Russian high school students took part in the worldwide review of the scientific and technical creativity of <b>Intel Intel</b> Youth;  this May, a delegation of 30 of our guys will go to the ISEF in the USA and, according to Shelley Shot, has a big chance to win one of three prizes.  In addition, since 2007, within the ‚Äú1 student: 1 computer‚Äù program, Intel has transferred about 6,000 computers to Russian schools, and more than 100,000 schoolchildren from all over Russia have participated in the ‚ÄúLearning from Intel‚Äù project since 2005.  Agree impressive numbers. <br><br>  Yaroslav Bykhovsky spoke about the latest version of the wonderful <b>Intel ClassMate PC</b> netbooks, which were presented at the recent CeBIT exhibition. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/9fe/01c/322/9fe01c3220ff079af9770e7dcfa37fd9.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/e10/bc4/45e/e10bc445e9c6c0ed90ac2a0e29b2a3f7.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Unfortunately, it was not possible to touch the novelties - while they temporarily stopped at the border of Russia and are waiting for a miracle.  As soon as at least one copy of the new device gets to the Moscow office of Intel, I will definitely write about it.  Last year I did a review ( <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/intel/blog/67948/">Part 1</a> , <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/hardware/68390/">Part 2</a> ) of the previous generation <b>Intel ClassMate PC</b> netbook.  At the same time, I briefly mentioned the competition between schools, when the Intel company donated to a number of schools those netbooks for implementation of the plans made by schools for free.  Many (even on Habr√©) were very skeptical then, they said that netbooks would drag away the director and headmasters, and they would not even reach the backwoods.  However, the first attempt of the pilot project took place and more than 200 Russian schools received the N-th number of devices <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/b6b/464/2dd/b6b4642dd23669472ec3678871de2030.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Intel this year (for the second year in a row) will hold a competition for the ‚Äú <b>School of the Future with Intel</b> ‚Äù projects to create an educational environment ‚Äú <b>1 student: 1 computer</b> ‚Äù among general education schools in Russia.  The goal of the competition is to direct the best achievements of Russian pedagogical thought to the benefit of developing education, to encourage active teachers and to demonstrate the results of their activities to the general public - all the details of the competition <a href="http://edugalaxy.intel.ru/index.php%3Fact%3Done2one%26CODE%3Dabout">can</a> already <a href="http://edugalaxy.intel.ru/index.php%3Fact%3Done2one%26CODE%3Dabout">be found</a> on EduGalaxy.  Last year, I gladly went to see my teachers, at the same time telling them about this competition - they participated, but did not win.  Hope this year we‚Äôll be lucky! <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/1d4/fd5/7dc/1d4fd57dc7ecbf1e207d2f604e97ac46.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Vera Baklashova told about the Russian version of the project, about its prospects and about the hopes placed on the project. <br><br>  In conclusion, the speakers answered the guests' questions, after which it was time for live communication, where I learned a lot of interesting things. <br><table><tbody><tr><td>  I happened to talk with one teacher, Elena Ilinichna, she teaches physics in one of the Moscow winning schools.  The full-fledged interview did not work, but in general she told a lot of interesting things. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/814/ae4/072/814ae4072e9d9848fd040593873f55e7.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  The first thing she noted was that it was really pleasant and interesting to try new technologies in education, but, as one would expect, not everything was so rosy.  In particular, as it turned out, the main problem never lies in netbooks, but much deeper - in infrastructure, unsystematic and disunity at all levels.  Because of what a great many small stones appear in education, about which the learning process all the time stumbles.  Problems lie literally everywhere - from the lack of specialized trained personnel and people who could fully serve the new technology, ending with the absence (for the present) of suitable content and even sockets. <br>  You can, of course, overtake textbooks in electronic form, but what will be the use of this?  Well, yes, there will be little savings on textbooks, but no more.  On the other hand, even this will not be done by anyone - as long as the state order for all kinds of literature is alive, where, again, nobody cares about anyone‚Äôs initiatives. <br>  It‚Äôs not so simple with teachers either - someone cannot master new technologies, but on the contrary, it considers it a lot of work and give everyone extra paycheck ... so teach children somewhere to log in and instill in them the basic principles of working with computer - the tenth thing, though also not easy (in the initial something classes). <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/adf/c95/f16/adfc95f162dff6c8da0b0159220336ba.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Accordingly, under all this time is needed - different from the lessons of computer science and other subjects.  Where does all this suddenly come from?  That's right, for now, from where ... and it seems only at first sight that everything is simple.  Indeed, "and what is there - I put the children at the desk, turned on the netbooks, started them a quake and went to drink coffee - they will figure it out, not small ones".  Therefore, the work is, in fact, much more than it seems at first glance ... there are no unsolvable problems, but in this case it is necessary to solve everything together. <br>  I really want to believe that very soon the educational affairs in the country will go uphill - after all, after 5-6 years to lead my son to school) Having learned in my own skin what education is and what his role in life is, I want the child to make the right choices in life, which is impossible without knowledge.  I think this is the natural desire of any parents for their child to be successful, because, in fact, our future depends on them, our children.  Therefore, what we sow, then we reap.  In the meantime, in the country something is very often sown) <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/fe7/65e/bee/fe765ebeed2a55aa3dcaa22ee2397ab0.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  It remains to hope that EduGalaxy will help the emergence of a strong educational community, whose members will be able to speak "the same language" and help each other. <br><br>  All those who are not indifferent are always happy to see on our projects - <b><a href="http://ru.intel.com/galaxy/forum/index.php">Intel Galaxy</a></b> / <b><a href="http://ru.intel.com/business/community/index.php">IT Galaxy</a></b> / <b><a href="http://edugalaxy.intel.ru/index.php">Intel EduGalaxy</a></b> . <br><br></td></tr></tbody></table>  By the way, no one wants to go on an exciting IT journey?  ) All those who answered positively can try their luck in a <a href="http://ru.intel.com/business/community/index.php%3Fautomodule%3Dblog%26blogid%3D8%26showentry%3D1385">contest</a> where 5 vouchers for ‚Äú <b><a href="http://ru.intel.com/business/community/index.php%3Fautomodule%3Dblog%26blogid%3D8%26showentry%3D1385">3 days with IT @ Intel</a></b> ‚Äù are played out.
