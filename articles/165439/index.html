  <section class="page js-page"><h1>‚ÄúHow to make a channel‚Äù or recording and mixing: the maximum from the minimum</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"><h4>  The sound was here </h4><br>  The bottom line is: <br><ul><li>  2013 has come; </li><li>  the war of loudness subsided (for it reached the maximum); </li><li>  audio recording contact got the tab recommended; </li><li>  software took on a greater role in sound processing; </li><li>  sofa guitar players record their 100th album. </li></ul><br>  So how to match the time and achieve everything at once? <br>  <i>(rather pathetically written or even thicker?)</i> <br>  Immediately stipulate that we will focus on recording guitar / vocals and mixing. <br>  My article imho, based on experience. <br>  There is much to be argued about and there is no perfect information; taste also influences here. <br>  This article will only show a real way with <b>minimal</b> costs and <b>maximum</b> results. <br>  <i>(Eh, again on the pathos pulled)</i> <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h4>  Tools </h4><br>  Ableton 8.3.4 - DAW for recording information.  I tried almost all the DAWs and stopped at it. <br>  It is the most convenient and functional for me.  But it's a matter of taste. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/76b/7f0/0ca/76b7f00ca4e5f7f9f7783d98a9c7aa03.jpg"><br>  Adobe Audition CS6 - cleaning tracks and other "thin" operations. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/597/9e4/4ad/5979e44ad81a298b047e2fa3beadb8f8.jpg"><br><br><h4>  Iron </h4><br>  Audio-technica AT2020 - condenser microphone.  It is fit.  Price: ~ 5k. <br>  Sensitivity: ‚Äì37 dB.  Dynamic range: 124 dB. <br>  In general, everything is as it should.  Regarding the choice of microphone, I will not breed holivars. <br>  A condenser microphone is the minimum necessary to record something of a decent level. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/821/36f/b30/82136fb30dfd47720d877af1b04a6782.jpg"><br>  ART Tube MP Project Series USB - a fairly cheap audio interface.  Price: ~ 3,5k <br>  It has everything you need for single-channel recording.  Phantom power and ADC&gt; 100 db. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/da5/59a/1a8/da559a1a8064bd1f47dea4b3e2b8bf68.jpg"><br>  Schecter Omen Extreme-7 is a good stick for metal processing.  Price: ~ 13k. <br>  The built-in sounds are not bad at all, and the cut-off on the tone gives a good maneuverability for sound. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/685/20f/c37/68520fc37e20039fc2e9a956fffcbe5a.jpg"><br><br><h4>  Let's do that! </h4><br>  We will consider the example of a cover of Lacuna Coil on Enjoy the Silence (Depeche Mode, yes). <br>  First of all we throw the party of buttons, strikes and bass.  We get something like: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/f58/809/959/f5880995973eac157323d9d5dfc76a3f.jpg"><br>  Addictive Drums 1.5.3 was used for the shots, Nexus 2 was used for the rest. <br>  Here, too, you should not breed holivary, but this set is usually enough above the roof. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/122/d65/d4f/122d65d4fa5e1bdff86a04d89ea6abf1.jpg"><br>  Guitars are recorded.  2 guitars for rhythm (doubletrek to different channels) and 1 solo. <br>  On all guitars lies only Amplitube 3.9.  There is such a delicious MH-500, quite a good-sounding analogue of the Fender iron combo.  For now we dub tracks only by volume. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/336/bd6/fa7/336bd6fa7ab7900edf07fbb7fa76bf92.jpg"><br>  The latest vocals.  Now we clean it in Audition.  Above we put the compressor, not very hard, because the dynamics in the voice are as important as possible.  And Izotope Nektar.  A kind of all-in-one and de-esser and reverb is not soapy. <br>  This recording is complete.  But why does everything sound like that ?!  Yes, if everything is recorded that way, then the master channel is now all so red and confused. <img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/e30/459/b39/e30459b396b739931f719e94c37cd32e.jpg"><br><h4>  Mix it out! </h4><br>  Let's reduce it!  In fact, mixing is cutting out of the tracks of what they do not need, but prevents other tracks from opening up.  But here are 3 ways: <br><ul><li>  Put on the master compressor and calm down; </li><li>  Reduce everything as an alpha-sounder and lose some delicious overtones, but everything will sound exactly; </li><li>  Make a channel, yes, we can stick a little, cut a little. </li></ul><br>  And yes, we will do that <b>CANAL.</b> <br>  The first step is leveling the volume so that the master goes only half out. <br>  But this is not cheesy even once.  This is not enough. <br>  <i>Then go 100 times axioms and you can not read, but I like to summarize.</i> <br>  Beats, even already processed, require compression.  The plates are only the top, the barrel is the bottom and the upper harmonic (catch it with your ear and highlight if you do not want it to sound like a cauldron with shit), the worker is the mid and top. <br>  Bass needs him to ‚Äúchvyakal‚Äù like your girl's pussy.  Catch the upper overtone and underline it.  (1000-1200 Hz) <br>  From guitars cut only very, very low.  Up to 90 Hz all.  And yes, sometimes there is a parasitic resonant harmonic, kill it. <br>  Vocals do not touch the equalizer.  Never.  The voice will lose its essence.  But if the bottoms chant, remove.

    <h4>  Limit your master! </h4><br>  They say that if everything is perfectly combined, then the master should not be touched at all. <br>  But our volume is everything, so Izotope Ozone is on top. <br>  That's what the output is: <a href="https://soundcloud.com/midasumi/midasu-enjoy-the-silence">soundcloud.com/midasumi/midasu-enjoy-the-silence</a> <br>  And what exactly is the output ... clipping track.  Yes.  But it is not compressed and quite listenable. <br>  I will not refuse to listen to opinions, even if they consist of one word describing your negative reaction. <br>  <i>In kontache on Midasu still a lot of this.</i> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/165439/">https://habr.com/ru/post/165439/</a></p>
