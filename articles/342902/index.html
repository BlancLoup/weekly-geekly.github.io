The combination of Junos OS with redundant architecture ensures uninterrupted delivery of services to the client in any network conditions. <br><br>  MX10003 has MEF CE2.0 Certification for services based on E-Line (100GbE), E-LAN ‚Äã‚Äã(10GbE), E-Tree (10GbE) and E-Access (100GbE). <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/ki/zn/pm/kiznpmtdbm3hrk4wv20dc6m02wo.png"><br>  <i>View MX10003 from the front and back</i> <br><br>  <b>Main characteristics</b> <br><br>  <b>Density</b> - 1,2T per slot <br>  <b>Modularity</b> - Multi-rate 1GE / 10GE / 40GE / 100GE with MACSec Option <br>  <b>Technologies</b> - 3D Memory, TRIO 3rd Gen, Microcode driven <br>  <b>Deployment</b> - Service Edge, Peering, Metro, Colo / Data Center <br>  <b>Software features</b> - rich set of queuing options <br><br>  <b>Compact design</b> <br>  - Modular platform, 2 Line Card 3RU slots <br>  - Standard 19 ‚Äùrack, 760 mm deep. <br><br>  <b>X86 Based Routing Engine</b> <br>  - Modular, redundant and upgradeable multi-core x86 router engine (Routing Engine). <br><br>  <b>Power supply</b> <br>  - Power consumption ~ 0.9W / G <br>  - AC / DC PSMs with N + N redundancy <br><br>  <b>Cooling and NEBS</b> <br>  - Excess cooling throughout the body <br>  - Compatible with NEBS standard <br><br>  <b>NEBS standard</b> <br><br>  The NEBS standard was developed by Bell Labs in the 1970s to standardize equipment to be installed in all offices of the company.  His goal was to facilitate the design of standard equipment.  This should have resulted in lower costs for developing and deploying new devices on the network. <br><br>  Later, the four largest US telecoms (AT &amp; T, Verizon, BellSouth and Qwest) created the Telecommunications Carrier Group (TCG), a group formed to synchronize the NEBS standards across the entire industry of the country.  The tasks of adhering to the NEBS criteria are ensuring the safety of personnel, protecting the property owner of the equipment and operational continuity. <br><br>  Although the NEBS standards are focused on the US telecommunications environment, they are mainly based on national / international standards and FCC requirements.  In particular, the thermal criteria of the NEBS standard require the equipment to operate in certain temperature and humidity ranges, and resume its work after returning to the specified ranges.  In addition to thermal requirements, the NEBS standard also contains various physical and electrical criteria. <br><br>  <b>MX10003 Modular Line Card Specifications</b> <br><br>  - 1.2T per slot;  upgrade to 6.4T per slot is possible <br>  - Ports 100GE, 40GE and 10GE ports <br>  - 12x100GE, 18x40GE or 72x10GE per line card <br>  - 12x100GE MACSec MIC support <br>  - Full HQoS and L4-L7 service <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/hx/pn/xr/hxpnxrpka2gw1pnjtvivxid_8vw.png"><br>  <i>Line Card Connection Diagram</i> <br><br>  <b>Typical application MX10003</b> <br><br>  <b>Business edge</b> <br>  - L2 / L3 VPN, VPLS, enhanced VPN support <br>  - A rich set of IP / MPLS features <br><br>  <b>Metro Ethernet</b> <br>  - Complete set of routing and switching properties <br>  - Supports OAM properties and MEF certification <br><br>  <b>Data center</b> <br>  - High density 10GbE / 100GbE interfaces <br>  - L2 / L3 VPN, MPLS-over-GRE, VXLAN, GRE support <br><br>  <b>Ip peering</b> <br>  - Supports IP Peering and route reflection capabilities <br>  - Traffic monitoring, segment routing, BGP, GRE <br>  <b>Distributed BNG</b> <br>  - Supports Broadband Network Gateway (BNG) features with current MX Series routers <br><br>  <b>BNG technology</b> <br><br>  Modern broadband network gateways (BNG) should have the technical characteristics and advantages by which network operators will improve the speed of their services, and.  as a result, market share and profitability. <br><br>  Juniper BNG, based on MX Series 3D Universal Edge Routers and Junos OS, helps broadband operators achieve their goals, providing service flexibility, optimal subscription density, and a high level of automation. <br><br>  The MX Series portfolio includes physical and virtual routing platforms with bandwidths of up to 80 Tbps, which are flexibly integrated into both the centralized and distributed BNG architecture.
