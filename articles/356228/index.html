  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Be a man, open ip</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Hi Giktayms!  I want to note right away that I tried very hard to avoid political issues, but since work as an IP is including taxes, and taxes are about the state, there is some politics in the post, I'm sorry.  Taki get started. <br><br>  The last 7 years I, like many here, read Habr (and now Giktayms), and usually I managed to cope with impulses to gash another post, and bright ideas were safely sent to the warehouse, where they never returned.  But a few weeks ago, everything changed.  I read a wonderful <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/post/300498/">post</a> called ‚ÄúIf, instead of applying for a job, they offer to open an IP,‚Äù and now I cannot be silent.  And so, let's see what got me so hooked ... <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  The main thing that I want to convey in this post is that when opening the company, you do not evade taxes (do tax officers read Giktaits?), But in fact you want to become an individual entrepreneur or not, with all the advantages and disadvantages of this concept. <br><br>  Perhaps I'll start with the minuses:

    <ol><li>  The SP responds with all of its assets.  Yes, this is true, and in this place we can return your head to the warm sand, or understand that you will set the framework for this responsibility as an IP. <br><br>  Let me explain - let's say you as IP Ivanov I.I., enter into an agreement with Romashka LLC, under which you work for them, write the software module, and if the agreement says that the planned module availability date is 12/31/2016, and for each day delay you pay a fine in the amount of 30% of the contract value, and the maximum amount of the fine is not limited, then yes, you hit, and maybe your apartment, if it is 100% owned by you, and it does not contain minor children, will go to LLC ‚ÄúChamomile‚Äù by the court, but if you read the contact before signing it, and correct  whether this clause is at a penalty of 0.1% per day, and the maximum amount of the fine cannot exceed 10% of the contract value, then everything starts to look different. <br><br>  In fact, contracts with SP are signed by others.  As a rule, the head of Romashka LLC understands that you are not ready to work without money until the end of the year, and you agree (you are an entrepreneur, and negotiations are now part of your work) that you provide your company with programming advice, on a chargeable basis, for 5 rubles a day.  There are practically no fines in such contracts; think further yourself. <br><br>  There may be fines from tax (for not reporting, or for late payments), but based on such considerations, it is better not to sign anything at all except an employment contract in life - this is dangerous!  For example, if you sell your car and don‚Äôt pay taxes, the tax may issue you a fine, and you will be surprised, but such a fine is unlimited!  In fact, the law simply spelled out the method of its calculation.  Well, with the responsibility of the IP and fines figured out, then it will be easier. <br></li><li>  I will not have a hospital / vacation / seniority / thermal slippers / wheels for hamsters.  Yes, it will not.  You are no longer an employee, but an individual entrepreneur, have you forgotten?  So what should I do? <br><br>  Vacation - calculate your annual income based on the fact that you will work not 12, but 11 months.  I will give an example at the end of the article. <br><br>  Insurance, business phone, slippers and all that you lose in comparison with the current place of work - include in the amount of annual income compensation.  At the same time I urge you to do it honestly - if you do not have an official car now, then it is not nice to include compensation for it.  I can say simply about insurance - if you are under 30, there are no children and chronic diseases, then it will not do for you.  In other cases, it must be considered. <br><br>  The length of service - well, in the first place, the IP actually pays for itself in the PFR, and secondly, google about ‚Äúfreezing pension savings‚Äù, and draw conclusions. <br></li><li>  If contact with you is terminated, you will receive what is provided by the contact in this case.  For someone it's 280 million.  Rub. And nothing to someone.  As a rule, a two-week notice is written in a normal contract before it is terminated.  And how much can you reduce staff? <br></li><li>  Theoretically, " <a href="https://journal.tinkoff.ru/ip-dogovor-nalogi/">The contract of the company with the SP can recognize labor and charge taxes</a> ."  To avoid this, you need to take the reports yourself to the tax department and provide services to more than one counterparty. </li></ol><br>  Probably, the downsides are over, now the pros: <br><br><ol><li>  Self-awareness.  Perhaps this is subjective, but when you get paid for the day, the world becomes very clear - you worked, you got, you didn't work ... And you finally understand why you go there, and what you do there. </li><li>  Money.  You did not think that PI is just like that?  In practice, if you work as an entrepreneur, then it‚Äôs normal to receive 150% of the level of remuneration of a staff member in a similar position, and if we are talking about doing temporary work, after which your services will no longer be needed, you can increase the request to 200% or more , look at the circumstances, now you ... well, you understood me!  It should be understood that this is not an attraction of unheard of generosity, but mutually beneficial cooperation. </li><li>  Time.  I have a familiar engineer who basically does not work in the summer, but prefers to earn in the remaining 9 months.  But he has a narrow specialization, a sea of ‚Äã‚Äãpositive reviews, and many who want to work with him. </li></ol><br>  Probably, I can write as many more on this topic, but I hope you understand the basic idea - by becoming an SP you have more freedom, and more responsibility, and if you are confident enough in your abilities, then consider, maybe it's worth it? <br><br>  <i>Promised example:</i> <br>  Now you get $ 100 / month, you have VHI and telephone.  How much to ask as ip? <br>  Everyone decides for himself but my IMHO (100 * 1.5 * 12 + (70 + 0.5 * 12)) / (11 * 0.94), where 100 * 1.5 * 12 - everything is clear (1.5 I want to get 50% more, 12 - months), 70-DMS, .5 * 12 - telephone.  And all this for 11 months, / 0.94 is a compensation of 6% of the tax.  It turns out ~ 180r / month.  In my experience, if you succeed, then for the first couple of years you will save on vacation, but then decide that health is more expensive.  The figures are approximate, taken from the ceiling. <br><br>  <b>PS</b> I have been working as an entrepreneur for the last 3+ years, I consciously went for it and have never regretted it.  May the Force be with you! </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/356228/">https://habr.com/ru/post/356228/</a></p>
