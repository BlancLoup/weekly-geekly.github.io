Many millions of people all over the world work diligently for the common good, but even when they are united in different communities and organizations, on a global scale their efforts are still fragmented, not complex, maybe this needs to be corrected?  Perhaps we need, without wasting time on long disputes, to unite our interests all over the world and achieve our goals?  But to unite and act effectively is very difficult.  This should be taught from the first grade of school and even earlier, but not taught.  This should every day to speak on all televisions and on all Internet, but do not speak.  Can we, the people who are here now, unite and <s>make</s> things <s>even worse</s> ?  I think we can!  I know that there are millions of people like me and we are gradually uniting (there are already a dozen people, and there will be more) with the help of the worldwide automated system ‚ÄúTechnocommunism‚Äù whose task (further to read in a loud voice) is to help mankind, give people motivation, knowledge and tools to work together to achieve a high-tech bright future. <br><br>  After reading the article, which is published simultaneously with this article, but on Hiktaims: " <a href="https://geektimes.ru/post/277130/">Technocommunism is the way to a bright future (not politics)</a> " - which tells in general about who techno-communism is and why it can and should be achieved first of all not by political means who fights for him and about the existing emotional prerequisites to strive for a brighter future, someone will say: ‚ÄúFantastic, snotty dreams, be a peasant, don't be humbled, quietly chew bread with nails, you are a Siberian, quite there in St. Petersburg, softened.  With my semi-bottomed thinking, I will answer again and again: "This is all possible, this is all purpose and tasks, this all just needs to be systematized in a project form and act on the basis of the resources that we have here and now, act together for the common good."  And for the global design work, again, we need a worldwide automated system.  This is what winding ways it is done and let's talk, of course, remembering that a significant part of our actions is experimental. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  <b>Prehistory</b>

      I have tried different ways to rebuild this world in more than 12 years since I made a decision for myself that I cannot wait for someone else to figure out the right path to a brighter future, since I want to, and the rest are moving slightly. (that which is not fully accomplished, nothing new is offered), then I myself must find a way to achieve my dream of a bright future.  Having received somewhere positive, but somewhere negative, some time ago, I once again thought about what I can do to achieve what I want in a decade or two, not in a hundred or two years.  I thought about what I am doing inefficiently, in which I am mistaken.  I learned to convince people, one at a time and by the crowd, I learned how to motivate people to do something for the common good without remembering about money.  All this turned out of course not always and not with everyone, but usually it worked.  It turned out, but it was not that.  There were projects with sonorous and enticing names (Earth Union, International Guards of the Earth Union, etc.), there was a great goal, more and more people were recruited in different countries, everything was interesting and looked very promising.  But the analysis showed me that moving with such speed and in such a way as we do with like-minded people, in the context of global processes that we just want to change, we are in fact just hanging out and not going anywhere.  It seems that this path was wrong. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/786/7bc/e1c/7867bce1c28240d7854a1520f12a5339.jpg" width="640"><br><br>  I tried different ways.  In the beginning, I went with the communist idea, then, in some ways, I began to move away from it, thinking that I should not be attached to words, to terms, to philosophical concepts, etc.  The main thing is people, and people can call the same things in different ways, but want the same thing.  Within the framework of this concept, the Earth Union was created - the global union of people.  I told people that religion is not important, if you are not a Satanist, of course, political views are not important, if you are not a liberal-fascist, of course, much that is not important.  Speaking of different things, we often talk about the same thing.  So it was possible to unite completely different people.  But after years it became clear that all this is true, but there must be a clearly defined, solid rod, otherwise we will not break through the built-in obstacles.  This is the way nature works, without a solid rod it is not possible to change the world and even children are not obtained.  I decided to check all my thoughts in a new environment, came with my wife and a cat to live in Cambodia where, in fact, almost did not know anyone.  Did not know the language.  I shoveled the country from the garbage and searched among the local population for new friends I found.  And to the end I realized that only 100% acceptance of reality allows us to act as efficiently as possible.  I knew this of course, but knowing and deeply realizing in practice are completely different things.  The reality is that working for the common good and obtaining personal benefits through social means is communism, people can be freed from the routine to occupy the most important thing only through the widespread introduction of advanced technologies, this is technocommunism.  And if we want this, then we need to go to this in the shortest way. <br><br>  It was to such thoughts about the right path that I came with a small group of like-minded people.  And the rest of the people either stopped on their way, or found something else, or continued the path they followed, many of which I myself sent at that time, but now I couldn‚Äôt stop, convincing that I needed to turn a little.  Different people have different interpretations of the world around them, different visualizations, different images.  Imagine (and perhaps this is about you) that you are a person who believes in various good and evil energies, in ‚Äúmake love, not war‚Äù - there were people among us with such a worldview.  Here you look around and see that you and like-minded people are jumping on pink unicorns in a rainbow, rays of goodness and love permeate you, ahead of your herd, your friend is nicknamed the ‚Äúgeneral secretary‚Äù, he is of course strange, if only because he is not pink, but red and through his wool a sickle and a hammer look through, but he is still his own person, who says that it does not matter what the bright future is called, the main thing we are moving towards him together, the world is beautiful ... and suddenly, he and some other friends of yours  red unicorns, and sit down on some kind of metal monsters with the inscription "Technocommunism" and say to others: "Guys, we rode merrily, but this is how we spend our lives on the road, and the goal to achieve is still important; in the spaceships and in general this rainbow, on which we are now standing, does not exist. ‚Äù  Do you think this is crazy?  So they asked me: ‚ÄúAnd what about your wife getting very sick?‚Äù - apparently thinking that amid the long illness of my wife, I lost my mind completely, since after so many years I decided that in many basic areas you need to do everything from scratch . <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/460/b42/228/460b422285f94b44a5880683ba1274ba.jpg" width="640"><br><br>  All the same, the great film "Forest Gamp", it clearly shows many things, for example, how to run and run, then understand that all this is not necessary and go do the real thing, while other people who have seen a deep sense in it the race cannot agree that all this was not so important as it seemed.  But it was all in vain, an invaluable experience was obtained. <br><br>  I summarize: no need to break anyone through the knee, exactly 500 years ago, in 1516, Thomas More wrote in Utopia, about the fact that if conditions are created where truth prevails, she will definitely win.  I think that we need to unite with those who are already like-minded people and create these conditions.  So in everything, but all this should develop harmoniously within the framework of a clear vector (core), which leads to a high-tech future with universal social equality - into techno-communism. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/1a0/a89/21c/1a0a8921c19e4acb9f400f4631062f8a.jpg" width="640"><br><br>  <b>Awareness</b> <br><br>  And now we come directly to how the technocommunism worldwide automated system appeared. <br><br>  1. If we want to live in a world where robotic systems produce the bulk of goods and services, and people are involved in family, space exploration, travel, etc., then we, understanding that any organization is a system, must understand that high-tech The world of the future is a worldwide automated system.  This is the system that manages all these robotized (automated) industries, transport and logistics systems, the best education for each person and there‚Äôs also a huge pile of everything. <br><br>  2. Once we are sure (and we are sure) that our future is technocommunism (that is, not just a technocracy without an ideological core that binds people), this worldwide automated system ensures the functioning of the technocommunist social formation and should be called "Technocommunism", thus expressing the main goal this whole automation (focusing on the goal is important). <br><br>  3. It turns out that in the future there will be a worldwide automated system on the basis of which everything will function, people will certainly conduct all sorts of exercises and trainings in order to live without global automation in the barbaric 20th century, but even all these training events will be planned and implemented through a training system that is part of a worldwide automated system.  In order to have this worldwide automated system in the future, it has to be done sometime.  Once we have firmly decided to achieve this (and we have decided), it means that already now our efforts should be directed towards the phased creation of such a system based on current resources. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/67f/759/ee4/67f759ee40914f41ae1d844400a022c5.jpg" width="640"><br><br>  <b>Concept</b> <br><br>  Now what?  All throw and do the king-bus integration, save on lunch for the purchase of the king-servaka?  No, the majority of people now do not understand why they need some kind of world-wide automated system "Technocommunism".  Many will even say that this is bad, but in a feature film about the terminators, it was shown what this leads to.  It is not clear to people that this is an exclusively capitalist topic, when in order to get more welded, in the capitalist world, corporations can combine civil automation with military objects into one system.  According to the logic of designing security systems - this is complete nonsense, but not according to the logic of those who want to earn more.  But in the world based on technocommunist principles at the basis of decision-making are not someone's personal gain, but the interests of the whole society, humanity.  This is all to show and prove to the general public. <br><br>  Even if we talk about those who immediately understood everything and agree that all this is necessary.  You have read this far, perhaps you can agree that everything is logical and it would be good to live in such a world, but at the same time you don‚Äôt stand up and shout: ‚ÄúKnow everything, I just learned the main truth in life, my life from now on, it has acquired the required meaning ‚Äù, if you are at work you will not open the door of your boss with your foot and do not tell him:‚Äú You are a grain of sand in an infinite universe, you have such a huge salary if you do not know the truth ‚Äù, and if you Chief, you do not run out in your underpants to the staff and do not say: "Guys, I did not know  the truth was a fool, let's honestly share the company's revenues, "well, and going into the elevator with strangers do not tell them:" You are probably wondering why I gathered you all in this place?  I did it in order to reveal the truth to you ‚Äù... although you can try with an elevator, I regularly ride in elevators.  We need a system of universal involvement, so that people happily walk in our slim ranks. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/35f/a1e/cfc/35fa1ecfc0a74fcd95cdbdd93edb0643.jpg" width="640"><br><br>  So what then to do?  Recall that only 100% acceptance of reality makes it possible to act as effectively as possible.  A world-wide automated system must first come to where people are now and have such a form, often very unexpected, that will provide every person with an interaction interface that is clear to him right now.  Where are the people?  Well, a significant part of them now seals, girls, flowers in social networks, and also collects diamonds in games, etc.  So the first thing that needs to be implemented is an Internet portal with the necessary functionality, including in terms of social networks, with the ability to integrate with other social networks, games, etc.  EAC Technocommunism, in order to be interesting and necessary for people, should be useful now, therefore already on this portal (an interconnected complex of portals) a functional should be implemented that makes people's lives better, which really helps society, gives people new tools or old tools, but in a new, more tempting way, etc. <br><br>  This can jar on some people, called techies.  They will say, what kind of world is this, you need to do automated production and integrate them, and here we are offered another blind social network.  Well, firstly: not only the social network and not just one, but in many ways unique, which I will briefly write below, and more separately, secondly: yes, that‚Äôs what the world is like, it‚Äôs now and thirdly : not everything is so bad for you, nor does anyone forbid you to take on the tasks of global automation right now.  Well, for example, on the Technocommunism portal, people are invited to create a group dedicated to their automation system and together with other representatives of other systems developers integrate various existing automation systems among themselves, thus moving towards integrating all the automation in the world.  In general, if you do not need to be lured into kittens and Komsomol members into a bright, automated future, if you already have the motivation, then no one stops you, set the tasks for the public as you see them, offer your solutions. <br><br>  It would be good not to waste time on creating all of this, but to implement on the existing largest social networks (of course, it is not always better faster), but so far they are resisting, it turns out they need to set an example that, as we offer, it is much better than how they are now.  In more detail how I communicated with representatives of the largest Internet companies in Russia, I will tell in a material (from video): "About that as I marked the thresholds of Habr, Mile, OniOfisa and a hall In the Circle of Friends". <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/965/98c/d12/96598cd128364cbc9906bc548e767352.jpg" width="640"><br><br>  <b>Implementation</b> <br><br>  In the domain zone .SU, a 4-letter domain was registered and it was attached to the simplest hosting, which probably won't pull out worldwide automation, but currently there are enough resources.  In the domain zone .SU, as the basis of all the services of the Internet portal YOU Technocommunism, which is still called that, but it will soon be called perhaps just ‚ÄúTechnocom‚Äù, is a plan to overcome the disorganization of the Soviet Union.  Someone will say that here we once again lacked a politbureau, but here we are not talking about a politburo at all.  In general, stepping back a little, I note that I would certainly choose a politburo instead of oligarchy, but fortunately the choice is wider.  Tips - this is the best of the existing forms of unification of people on a territorial and functional basis.  Well, this is when everyone equally solves specific tasks, when there is no social stratification, etc.  The union of various councils is the Soviet Union.  Yes, in his time there were not ideal moments in him, but we don‚Äôt need them, we need the best.  This is the essence of the plan, to take the best from the Soviet Union and introduce, use, distribute on the basis of high technologies.  I will describe this moment in more detail in a separate article. <br><br>  In general, at the first stage of implementation, at which we are still present, it is necessary to implement theoretical concepts somehow without spending extra resources to look at it, poke, think, find something that was not previously thought out, look for new ideas.  For this, the WordPress engine was taken (although I worked all my life mostly with Joomla) and an infinite number of plugins were instructed on it, I thought it would die, but no, it keeps.  Much has been implemented according to the type of how an industry makes a mass-dimensional mock-up, well, it seems like there is a functional here that does this, and then there is what is needed, but in fact it is done manually.  The site says that this is the BETO version (in the international language, Esperanto is spelled this way, with an ‚ÄúO‚Äù at the end), but this is essentially a beta version of the test alpha, which works very conditionally, no one tried to catch the bugs. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/e3d/b98/79b/e3db9879bcfa4466bc503b62989fade5.jpg" width="640"><br><br>  Now <s>I</s> ‚Äôll <s>finally</s> describe the functionality that is either in the embryonic test form, or not yet, but it will be.  While all the same brief, for all the main blocks will be separate materials. <br><br>  - <b>Social network</b> .  The basic functionality is the same as in all social networks, but the social network is based on the concept ‚ÄúEvery action, for the common good‚Äù developed by us.  I will write about this in detail separately, if briefly, then every button likes pictures, every diamond in the game, you need to bring an interface through which these actions will not remain just virtual, they will be transformed into real business.<font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">For example, a public initiative, global or on the topic of the picture, is connected to each photo automatically or by choice. When you like a picture, you support this initiative along the way, as well as adding to friends, when you add a person to a friend, you support the social initiative that he chooses as the main one. So far, what I have written may look cumbersome, but there are already a lot of ideas on how to do this in order to really work and not bother people. </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">- </font></font><b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Community initiatives, they are petitions</font></font></b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">. Implemented within the social network. It is planned to divide into a simple petition (public initiative) and a public project, which is distinguished by the fact that it is not just a proposal and a description of what can be done, but a project in which the public collectively specifies tasks, offers ways of obtaining and efficient use of resources and etc. For example, I was one of the first to decide to make such a petition, which will grow into a public project: ‚ÄúTransferring the Federation Council of the Federal Assembly of Russia to the city of Vladivostok‚Äù. Why it is needed and how to do it, the petition will be described, read. Do not worry, there will be many automation petitions in the front row, which will be much easier to implement than the transfer of the Federation Council to another part of the country. I gave this example in orderin order to just show the essence of the transition of a petition to a public project, that this is a case where you cannot just collect 100,000 signatures and this will be implemented. They will find a thousand excuses why this cannot be done, because members of the federation want to eat in Moscow restaurants, use the infrastructure of the capital, and they would prefer to solve the problems of the development of 2/3 of the country (Eastern Siberia and the Far East) remotely. But within the framework of a public project, all these excuses will be fixed and worked out with an indication of how all these obstacles are overcome and what benefits this will have for specific regions and the whole country and we will talk about this in all media, because this is a media, interesting topic.After all, members of the federation want to eat in Moscow restaurants, use the infrastructure of the capital, and they would prefer to solve the problems of the development of 2/3 of the country (Eastern Siberia and the Far East) remotely.

There is more likely a petition, this is the initial level of a public project, as this is the most important part of the future global automation. What do robotic systems do? They do not just aimlessly make goods and services, but satisfy the needs of society. And what are these needs expressed? They are expressed in clearly defined tasks that exist within various public projects (the Food project, the Cleanliness project, the Health project, etc.). That is, all the affairs of society - this is a global list of public projects and subprojects, tasks and subtasks. Public projects will be gradually created in various directions, so that within them people and whole organizations can unite their efforts. This is what I said at the very beginningthat people and organizations do different useful things, but on the whole it‚Äôs all separated, thanks to this functionality, firstly: you can see what and where you can do and what a useful result will be, secondly: it‚Äôs clearly clear that removing garbage in one park cities and creating infrastructure so that there is less garbage, everything clearly, in numbers and beautiful graphs and pictures, see that they are working, virtually shoulder to shoulder with people from different cities in different countries, thirdly: sharing experience, common base buildings.virtually shoulder to shoulder with people from very different cities in different countries, and thirdly: the exchange of experience, a common base of buildings.virtually shoulder to shoulder with people from very different cities in different countries, and thirdly: the exchange of experience, a common base of buildings.</font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">- </font></font><b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Organization management services.</font></font></b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">This mini-ERP is primarily for public organizations, trade unions and public companies. Then we will expand all this, but the primary task is to completely take this generally empty niche, which is of course free because within the framework of standard business models of automation systems, working with this part of the market does not look profitable, there is little money, but in our case when traffic is important to us, the creation of a mini-ERP as a functional extension of communities (groups) looks rational. This functionality should be useful both to those who already have some organizations, and to those who are just thinking of creating them. A person presses the button to create a community in a social network, chooses the option "People's Enterprise", answers questions about the direction, region, etc.,after which it offers a person to join an already existing project to create a national enterprise or create a new one. If it is new, then there is a step-by-step list of what and how to do. The same with the union, and with the public organization.</font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">- </font></font><b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Online education</font></font></b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">. The main task of the people of the future in a technocommunist society, those who are not at the forefront of science and did not become a scientist, is personal development. Since the higher the average level of development of the whole society, the more in the society will appear those very accountants who will advance humanity to new horizons. All the development of people will be built on the acquisition of new blocks of knowledge, and knowledge in the future is not only a theory, but also practical skills. Mastering each block (level) will give a person new opportunities in society (the value of a voice when making common decisions in one direction, better housing, etc.). So we will collect these blocks of knowledge so that people can already improve themselves and it would be useful for them today. Whole educational processAll knowledge and all science in general will be structured into 5 main groups, in which there will be 5 universities (university groups): University of Techno-Communism, University of Space, University of Culture, University of Immortality, and University of Nature. For now, everything will be in electronic form, and later the university buildings will be built in the center of the high-tech city New Leningrad, which will be built on the shore of Lake Peipsi, I will talk about the project of this city, as I have already said, later on, including the plan how to push it through to real life, when I post it, see my video message to Vladimir Putin, which seems to be fun and convincing.For now, everything will be in electronic form, and later the university buildings will be built in the center of the high-tech city New Leningrad, which will be built on the shore of Lake Peipsi, I will talk about the project of this city, as I have already said, later on, including the plan how to push it through to real life, when I post it, see my video message to Vladimir Putin, which seems to be fun and convincing.For now, everything will be in electronic form, and later the university buildings will be built in the center of the high-tech city New Leningrad, which will be built on the shore of Lake Peipsi, I will talk about the project of this city, as I have already said, later on, including the plan how to push it through to real life, when I post it, see my video message to Vladimir Putin, which seems to be fun and convincing.</font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">- And there is also the </font></font><b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">International Technocommunism Awards System</font></font></b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">. Each award consists of the honorary signs of ten degrees, then goes into the medals of 5 degrees, then the order (without degrees). The awards have names and bear the name of a person from the 20th century who in some way made a significant contribution, as a rule, they are cosmonauts and revolutionaries. For example, the award ‚ÄúFriendship‚Äù named after Valentina Tereshkova and the award ‚ÄúCosmos‚Äù named after Yuri Gagarin. Rewarding will be for a wide range of actions - achievements, both for creating content of different subjects, and for helping the disadvantaged, in addition, for achievements in games that will be implemented and certified under the concept of "Every Action for the Common Good of Man", that is, containing in itself not only entertaining, but also realistically learning elements, tasks fulfilling which you help real people, Technocommunism awards will also be provided.Rewards will be displayed by default in the profile on the portal and sites that support integration, but they can also be ordered in real form (at cost, here is the task to reward, not earn).</font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">- </font></font><b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">There will be a lot of other</font></font></b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> things that stem from the above described functionality as its extension, for example, if people create new organizations using our services, then they need to look for like-minded employees, to give vacancies, to view resumes, so there should be functional. How to implement this and much more so as not to make a complex monster that people cannot use, but to make everything convenient and useful is already quite well thought out, but this is still secondary in relation to the above, so we are not going to overload it now This article and for now we will stop.</font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Hearing what was voiced from me above, people either say that it‚Äôs certainly difficult, but it would be nice to do it, or they say that it‚Äôs all like a game, that I‚Äôd better take a fantastic book and write money for it. I tell them that you understand me and others like me. We do not agree to exchange real life for a virtual one; we do not agree to exchange a common good, for a personal warm place. Moreover, the real life, real achievements, they are more interesting. For example, would you not like to not just build a virtual space fleet, but to make it real? I understand that people like games, like fantasy, so that people, including me, want to do something useful more, all this should be built in an interesting form and of course should be rewarded in various ways, then there will be the necessary motivation.</font></font><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/2ad/581/a7f/2ad581a7fde6486d8abb301976fe68b3.jpg" width="640"><br><br> <b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Read More</font></font></b> <br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> Here is all of the above, we must now do in the normal way. In the following materials, along with the already announced ones, I will also talk about what people's enterprises are and how good they are, I will invite everyone to unite in the amount of 50 people in order to create a joint national enterprise, I will tell you about the strategy that we will follow to To succeed and listen to smart people, and then I will cover what and how we do in different directions.</font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">I really want to live in a high-tech bright future. Reasonable ways to achieve it, as I see it, are available. I propose to discuss this, but not in the style of ‚Äúthis is another freak, who cannot sit in his native warm reality,‚Äù let's talk without too much chromopatriotism (as I call it, the phenomenon when people in absolute terms are sure that our time is the best for ever or better , even if theoretically possible, it will not work). Think about it! Here you are comrade, you are a reasonable person, and here I am too, and my friend Khmer Polit Yeung (by the way, a tough guy, in Cambodia, for the State Department money, manages to promote not American interests, but Russian culture, a hero of our time, in one word, I will tell you about him ), and your friends with familiar or overseas names are also reasonable. We are all, in one way or another, reasonable people.After all, life is not endless yet and not even hundreds of years long, and many of us have not even 50 years. I want to spend life on the maxim important and we can!</font></font><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/c26/c52/a57/c26c52a578b74c369d1e7d7facb8863e.jpg" width="640"><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Previous material: " </font></font><a href="https://geektimes.ru/post/277130/"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Technocommunism - the path to a bright future (not politics)</font></font></a><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> ."</font></font></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/303124/">https://habr.com/ru/post/303124/</a></p>
