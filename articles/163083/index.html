  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Putin and information technology</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  I am risking to pick up a bunch of minuses for this post on apolitical Habr√©, but I decided to publish this opus.  I was wondering how the president‚Äôs message relates to existing information services and bases and what else can be done in this direction for the development of society and control over our power. <br><br>  Therefore, I rejected my political attachments of the <s>anarcho-syndicalist</s> and carefully studied the message of the president.  The result was the following list, consisting of quotes from the president‚Äôs speech and which services for solving the indicated problems have already been created or can be created.  If my reasoning seems a bit amateurish to you, then I do not ask you to judge strictly, but to express my point of view. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br><blockquote>  <i>Responsibility for the country is formed not by slogans and appeals, but when people see that the government is transparent, accessible and ‚Äúinject‚Äù itself in the name of the country, city, region, village and every citizen, it takes public opinion into account.</i>  <i>Power should not be an isolated caste.</i> <br></blockquote><br>  Obviously, to solve this problem, the society / people should have access to full, operational information about the activities of the authorities.  Although in reality this alone is undermining all the foundations of power, since its basis is precisely the secrecy and limited information.  At the same time, at the federal level, public reporting in one form or another is developed quite well.  For example, the famous Ivan Begtin <a href="http://ivan.begtin.name/">ivan.begtin.name</a> is actively engaged in this topic. <br>  Examples of what has been done can be given - the availability of forms for feedback on the websites of most government sites.  And from my own experience of communicating with the federal antimonopoly service <a href="http://fas.gov.ru/">fas.gov.ru</a> in various regions I can say that most often this communication system works and the answer eventually comes.  Similarly, at the municipal level, it was well done in Yekaterinburg <a href="http://xn--80acgfbsl1azdqr.xn--p1ai/officially/ewroom/">. / officially / ewroom</a> . <br>  But a significant drawback of all these control systems is that no one except the officials is often seen how many appeals and on what questions and what answers were given.  All job statistics are usually closed.

      Thus, in order to solve the problem designated by the president, all the activities of state bodies, ranging from a separate village to the federal level, should be provided with a system of public reporting and statistics. <br>  Similarly, in the public key should be built a system for filing appeals of citizens, monitoring the passage of appeals and execution of decisions made on them. <br>  In fact, a single standard electronic document management system between the state and citizens is needed. <br><br><blockquote>  <i>It is necessary to create favorable conditions, first of all, for women, so that they do not fear that the birth of the second and subsequent children will close their path to a career, to good work, and will force them to confine themselves exclusively to the household.</i>  <i>What we started to do - solving the problem of queues in kindergartens, the professional retraining program for women with children, support for flexible forms of employment - will directly influence the choice of family in favor of the second and third children.</i> </blockquote><br>  Everything is quite simple here and is usually solved at the level of municipalities and districts with information bases of various levels of complexity - starting from Excel files with a list of kindergartens and the number of places in them, to normal systems where every parent can watch his turn almost in real of time. <br><br>  The problem of distance education can be considered solved in general, but I don‚Äôt personally know only specialized resources aimed specifically at educating women with children, taking into account the particularities of women‚Äôs daily routine and a set of skills that can be acquired remotely.  Moreover, it is desirable that such distance education systems and the knowledge / skills gained in them be recognized by employers. <br><br>  As for the ‚Äúflexible forms of employment,‚Äù then of course you need a freelance exchange, but also focused on women with children and including a set of works not only programmers, designers and translators / rewriters. <br><br><blockquote>  <i>We set the task to create and modernize 25 million jobs by 2020.</i>  <i>This is a very ambitious and difficult task, but we can solve it.</i>  <i>We can help people find good and interesting work.</i>  <i>It is high-quality jobs that will become the locomotive for the growth of wages and the well-being of citizens.</i>  <i>This is the main direction of our strike, as they say.</i>  <i>We need to revive engineering schools and training workers.</i>  <i>In general, a person needs to pay more attention.</i> <i><br></i>  <i>I am instructing the Government to develop and implement a national system for assessing the quality of vocational education in the two years.</i> </blockquote><br>  In general, here is the same as for mothers with children - a set of specialized niche resources for skilled workers and engineers, including perhaps a specialized social network, a <a href="http://www.trudvsem.ru/">general government</a> search engine and bank resumes <a href="http://www.trudvsem.ru/">www.trudvsem.ru</a> and a system for assessing and testing workers' skills and engineers. <br><br><blockquote>  <i>Third, the professional community of medical workers, teachers, scientists, cultural workers will receive a new stimulus for development.</i>  <i>Such communities should be the core of a vibrant and active civil society.</i>  <i>It is fundamentally important for society to be able to objectively assess the state of the social sphere and science.</i> <br></blockquote><br>  Here, of course, we are talking about niche social networks, because now they are the real professional communities. <br><br><blockquote>  <i>I ask the Government together with the Presidential Administration to formulate proposals for creating a system of public monitoring of the quality of medicine, education, scientific results, and demand for cultural institutions by April of next year.</i>  <i>It is necessary to involve professionals in this work, to see the best international experience.</i> <br></blockquote><br>  Service for public monitoring of the quality of medicine, education, scientific results, demand for cultural institutions.  And the main factor in assessing this quality of course should be the opinion of consumers, namely us and you. <br><br><blockquote>  <i>I emphasize: it is a mistake to present the program of personnel development as a simple increase in salaries according to the principle ‚Äúto all sisters in earrings‚Äù, that is, to all equally, without taking into account the qualifications and real contribution of each employee.</i>  <i>Each organization ‚Äî medical, educational, scientific ‚Äî must have its own program of development and personnel renewal.</i> <br></blockquote><br>  A single all-Russian system for assessing skills and knowledge, accounting personnel and planning the development of personnel competencies.  Of course, this can be done primarily for budget organizations, but nothing prevents the market from offering this to business first, and then go into the public sector. <br><br><blockquote>  <i>Today, Russian society is experiencing a clear lack of spiritual braces: mercy, compassion, compassion for each other, support and mutual assistance - a deficit of what always, at all times, historical made us stronger, stronger than we have always been proud of.</i> <br></blockquote><br>  The answer to this can be services for social sharing services, things, etc.  As an example, <a href="http://otdamdarom.ru/">otdamdarom.ru</a> <br>  In addition, a unified system of registration of volunteer communities, so that everyone can register and receive information about where his help and skills are needed throughout the country. <br><br><blockquote>  <i>It is necessary to develop a system of technical and artistic creativity, open circles, sections, summer sports camps, special educational tourist routes for children.</i> <br></blockquote><br>  Open mugs, of course, well and correctly.  But it‚Äôs not enough to open it, we also need information about this to be obtained by parents, and for this, of course, we need a single reference and information system on additional education, recreation and tourism for children. <br><br><blockquote>  <i>Today in Russia there are a lot of people who selflessly implement public charity projects.</i> <br></blockquote><br>  Portal of public charity projects, search for philanthropists and volunteers <br><br><blockquote>  <i>We will not allow the emergence in Russia of closed ethnic enclaves with their informal jurisdiction, living outside the single legal and cultural field of the country, calling ignoring generally accepted norms, laws and rules.</i> <br></blockquote><br>  There certainly needs RosAnklava Navalny-style - a system for identifying and recording enclaves nationwide and transmitting information to the appropriate authorities.  Only openness and publicity in this area can make it possible to solve this problem, and of course, in spite of the declaration, it is still beneficial for the government at all levels to conceal such information. <br><br><blockquote>  <i>I also instruct the Government to submit proposals for the implementation of distance education in Russian.</i>  <i>It should be accessible to the youth of the Commonwealth countries, for our compatriots all over the world.</i>  <i>It is important to support schools in the CIS and in other states that teach in Russian, including teacher support, help with textbooks, and material resources.</i>  <i>It is necessary to create a system of international school Olympiads in the Russian language.</i> <br></blockquote><br>  Here we need a system of distance learning of the Russian language, holding competitions, a catalog of Russian schools and centers abroad.  Why not, for example, the service <a href="http://lingualeo.ru/">lingualeo.ru</a> not take up training in Russian abroad.  It is possible that if they came to the top with such an initiative, they would receive the required support and resources. <br><br><blockquote>  <i>Democracy is an opportunity not only to choose the power, but also constantly to control this power, to evaluate the results of its work.</i>  <i>We should pay more attention to the development of direct democracy, direct democracy, including the right to popular legislative initiative. I have already spoken about this, you know, when an idea that has received civilian support, including on the Internet, is mandatory for consideration in parliament.</i> <br></blockquote><br>  Obviously, the above-mentioned systems for collecting and publicly displaying statistics on government activities and public control services are needed. <br><br>  As for the system of collecting ideas for the parliament, we already have a system of collecting ideas and voting for them for nomination to the Duma <a href="http://e-democratia.ru/">e-democratia.ru</a> .  As an example from the other side of the ocean, the American system <a href="https://petitions.whitehouse.gov/">petitions.whitehouse.gov</a> <br><br><blockquote>  <i>The state should and will strive to ensure equal access for all political parties to the media, not only during election campaigns, but in current life.</i>  <i>But we must understand, dear colleagues, that this is not an easy task.</i>  <i>At the beginning of the year, we had seven parties, now I think they are forty-eight, and more than two hundred organizing committees have been organized and are working on creating their own parties.</i> <br></blockquote><br>  This suggests a nationwide catalog of political parties in Russia with their programs, news, regional presence, voting history and statistics for them and their participation in elections at various levels, party personalities, representation in government and self-government bodies, etc. <br><br><blockquote>  <i>The first.</i>  <i>The orientation of the work of all links of the state mechanism and levels of government towards a measurable, transparent and understandable for society result of the work.</i> <br></blockquote><br>  Public reporting service with visualization and tracking the dynamics of changes over time. <br><br><blockquote>  <i>The second.</i>  <i>The widespread introduction of new forms and methods of control.</i>  <i>The main criterion for assessing the effectiveness of the government providing services to citizens, as well as social institutions, should be public opinion, the opinion of citizens themselves.</i> <br></blockquote><br>  The system of collecting feedback and evaluation by citizens of the activities of bodies, including by personnel <br><br><blockquote>  <i>As for real estate abroad, in any case, in accordance with the law, it must be declared, and the official must report both the cost and the origin of the income that allowed him to make this transaction.</i> <br></blockquote><br>  Service for the centralized collection of all declarations of officials and tracking violations in them and changes in dynamics, a visual display of movable and immovable property and its market value.  Something a la <a href="http://rospravosudie.com/">rospravosudie.com is</a> only for official declarations. <br><br><blockquote>  <i>It is in such universities that more additional budgetary places need to be opened, the state should support the development programs of such universities.</i>  <i>At the same time, it is of fundamental importance that business be involved in the management of such universities and in their financing.</i>  <i>All this, among other things, will stop the practice, when a lot of resources are spent on preparing students in Moscow and St. Petersburg who are not even going to get a job in the acquired specialty.</i> <br></blockquote><br>  An open intercollegiate system of collecting business applications for certain specialties, which would include a publication on the number and type of education, which specialties are prepared in universities, a system for automated collection of business applications for certain specialties and certain students (of course, followed by the conclusion of formal contracts), etc. .  etc. <br><br>  At this point, I finish, and if you have your own examples of services or thoughts on them, then I ask you to comment in the comments. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/163083/">https://habr.com/ru/post/163083/</a></p>
