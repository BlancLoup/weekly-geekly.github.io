Namely, about the calendar for ITshnikov and all who just like it.  Why such an idea arose, what motivated us and what is the result, will be discussed in this article. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  When programming various applications for different platforms, the thought often arises: Did my program help someone?  Or maybe nobody needs it?  After all, when you do something that someone needs ... that solves someone's problems, and why the person using the program has stopped lingering at work, because some process has become automated ... it always gives the development much more pleasure than when no one is trying to use your application.  There are many reasons to enjoy software development.

In addition to your program, this bank has about 350 projects, each of which can be divided into 5-10 subprojects.  And each of these subprojects due to the use of other projects from other development teams (some of which are located in India, and some in England, for example) is written, to put it mildly, distorted.  Well, your program is not an exception to this rule.  And let your program copy files from point A to point B. Bored, you say, a little motivation?  But in fact, this program not only automates a process, it acts as a very powerful helper to the support team.  After all, the human factor is now excluded, because of which the wrong versions of files in the wrong folders were constantly laid out.  You helped an uncountable number of employees who were raised at night due to an incident caused by another sleepy employee who manually using the remote desktop through the SSH tunnel in some kind of internal security protocol, logged in tokens, copied this file and made a mistake in its name on symbol. <br><br>  Take a different situation ... They came up to you and asked you to write a contact manager for the Android OS.  Is it boring  Not at all!  Unlike games and other applications, the contact manager is an application that will never be deleted, and which will live while the phone itself is alive.  Consider how responsibly you need to approach the development of this application.  It should be comfortable and thoughtful. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/a07/263/824/a07263824705567175b4432c74480d89.jpg"><br><br><br>  We decided to make this calendar so that people can feel that IT is not just something new in our life.  IT is firmly established in our lives.  IT is everywhere, from your pockets, where plastic cards work from Java, and phones are more like laptops than just communications.  And the downloads of space stations and air defense equipment.  Music, art, planning, finance ... Yes, almost everything is now controlled by computer systems.  While you are currently reading this article, there are so many computers in the world that their computing power is enough for the Institute of Nuclear Physics to calculate the physical processes that occur when an atomic bomb explodes. <br><br>  Here, for example, below is the page devoted to love, the month of March.  We have long thought what to choose.  After all, it is necessary to make it so that it attracts lovely ladies, and the men are not afraid, scrolling through this page. <br><br>  This page is designed to show how the world has become one with the advent of computer technology, which has become unthinkably easy, if desired, to take and write a letter to the Chinese.  Just to say good morning to him!  And he will receive this message almost instantly!  This page tells the story of two people who met on the Internet and united by common interests.  They are at a great distance from each other and live in different countries.  When dawn breaks out with one interlocutor behind the window, the other has night and lights come on ... These two have completely different faith, different values, different language ... But using their laptops, they are together.  They can communicate on those topics that they are interested in.  They can be inspired by each other's work, the results of each other ... They can fall in love with each other, and dream of being together.  These are truly amazing features that computer technology gives us.  Have you ever lay on the couch, remembering the last conversation with your loved one? <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/0ac/a57/6ee/0aca576ee7295ff34bd34624b13c8436.jpg"><br><br><br>  And computer games, allowing you to find your imagination in any place?  Want to feel what a family is?  And there is a simulator.  Want to ride a bike?  Manage an army of robots?  Win the Battle of Germany?  Go to other galaxies?  Millions of programmers in the world are working so that you can do it!  Millions of testers are testing the games so that they do not contain those annoying errors that resulted in the game crashes, but you did not have time to survive.  You want to survive before they kill you, right?  Millions of jobs are aimed at making your fantasies come true.  Tens of thousands of engineers design video cards capable of displaying a truly photo-realistic image of the world that will help your imagination to get the most pleasure. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/d1a/391/1ec/d1a3911ec88666d005a5d1ec0538a0cd.jpg"><br><br><br>  Now countless people can easily transfer their fantasies using software on screens, drawing, modeling ... This should reflect our next work, called ‚Äúinspiration‚Äù.  It's not so important that around ... A pile of unwashed dishes, there is no food in the fridge, or your body aches from fatigue ... But if you are covered with inspiration, everything goes by the wayside!  Your thoughts are shrouded in ideas and images ... You cannot stand still and think about something else.  Now you are there, inside your thoughts ... And your hand sketches the flow of thoughts in a short order, using a pen and a tablet ... Fantasy ... creativity ... That's what is the driving force of the artist.  And it is wonderful that now an artist can easily sketch a sketch, being in a hustle in a subway car just because he had a great idea. <br><br><h4>  When </h4><br>  Very soon, in about two weeks, we are announcing the release of the project, and we very much hope that the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãdonating to yourself or someone for the new year the fotma A2 calendar, made by the best freelancers, will seem good.  Closer to the release, we will write a couple more articles in which we will talk about the specifics that we encountered during the development of the calendar and the difficulties. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/74c/a84/30a/74ca8430af8f73c4d209eb163437f9c1.jpg"><br><br><br><h4>  Also </h4><br>  We also want to note that we have introduced three methods of monetization of the project: <br><ul><li>  You can make money on a project if you publish a link to a project somewhere (it will appear later, along with the publication of the project) and if you follow this link, people will buy calendars.  If you recommend us to a store that will contact us to place an order, you will also receive a percentage of sales.  The calendar is English-speaking, therefore publications can be not only on Russian resources.  Those.  enough to publish in the maximum number of blogs to which you have access.  It's not difficult, is it?  We are not greedy and give a third of the profits from sales on your recommendation.  If you have any ideas or a desire for us to remind you about the project‚Äôs launch in person - write in person, we will contact you; </li><li>  Dear IT companies.  If you have not yet decided what to present to your employees, then, in my opinion, you have found a win-win solution.  If you have a desire to give such a calendar to your employees, feel free to contact me.  I will try to answer all your questions as quickly as possible; </li><li>  Very soon, you can just go to our website and buy it in one or several copies.  The cost of the purchase is determined by the cost of the calendar (600r.) Plus the cost of delivery to the city or around the city (if it is Peter). </li></ul><br>  We reserve all copyrights for the authors.  What kind of practice to say that he did everything himself?  Works are performed by completely different artists, each in his own non-repeatable style.  And it gave us the opportunity to get 13 not similar to each other works.  All authors must sign their work.  Plus, at the end of the calendar will be published a full list of authors with a list of their contacts.  Without you, dear illustrators, this would never have become a reality. <br><br>  <b>So, the format is A2, a spring on a short edge, 13 works of art on the topic of technology.</b>  <b>Great gift for any new year</b> ! <br><br>  <b>UPD:</b> Delivery - to anywhere in the world, which delivers <b>EMS</b> <br><br>  See you in a couple of weeks! </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/157829/">https://habr.com/ru/post/157829/</a></p>
