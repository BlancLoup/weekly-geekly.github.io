The company has listened to marketers and, apparently, is going to name for simplicity, the Bluetooth version 5 without the usual point.  More interesting is that the new version will provide twice as fast connection, and the range will increase four times compared with Bluetooth 4.2.  Another important update is related to the function of broadcast advertising connection packages: Bluetooth devices will be able to send enlarged pieces of information to gadgets with which they are not associated. <br><br>  <i><b>ADF:</b> corrected indicators - according to the Bluetooth SIG message, there was an error in the news: the radius will increase 4 times, and the speed - 2 times, and not vice versa, as in the first mailing.</i> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/e37/5da/a37/e375daa37639cbda18867227c2507546.png" width="400" alt="image"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Bluetooth technology began to be developed in 1994 as a wireless replacement for RS-232 cables.

      Bluetooth is used to transfer data between personal computers and peripherals, gaming consoles and joysticks, between phones and headsets, headphones, smart devices.  The use of Bluetooth has led to the fact that now in Russia there is a whole generation of people who remember how at school they transferred music and pictures from phone to phone. <br><br>  The technology is tied to the use of radio waves in the ISM-band (Industry, Science and Medicine), it uses the license-free range of 2.4-2.4835 GHz, and it uses a frequency-hopping spread spectrum (FHSS) spread spectrum method. ).  Thanks to a pseudo-random switching sequence between frequencies, several devices can work next to each other without interference. <br><br>  The first version of Bluetooth 1.0 was ready in 1998, but the problem was poor compatibility between products from different manufacturers.  Version 1.1 fixed a number of errors and received an indication of the power of the received signal.  The compatibility issue was decided by the standardization of the Bluetooth 1.2 version by the IEEE working group.  The speed of version 2.0, released in 2004, reached 2.1 Mbit / s due to the technology of accelerated data transfer Enhanced Data Rate (EDR), and the base speed was 1.1 Mbit / s.  In 2007, 2.1 could request device mapping characteristics for mating and save battery.  Bluetooth 3.0 with HS technology in 2009 could, in theory, accelerate to 24 Mbit / s. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/380/337/794/380337794162c7acba033a8044692d5b.jpg" width="600" alt="image"><br>  <i>Ericsson T39 - the first phone with Bluetooth support, 2000</i> <br><br>  Until recently, the advanced version was Bluetooth 4.2.  A lot of <a href="https://geektimes.ru/post/235293/">wearable devices</a> without smartphone support of this version simply will not work.  Bluetooth 5 replaces 4.2. ArsTechnica, citing a letter from Bluetooth SIG executive director Mark Powell, <a href="http://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2016/06/bluetooth-5-spec-coming-next-week-with-2x-more-range-and-4x-better-speed/">says</a> that the speed of the new standard will increase 2 times compared to 4.2, the range will be 4 times higher, and will also give ‚Äúmuch more opportunities for broadcast packets.  At the time of this writing, the letter itself was not available.  Already in version 4.2 such packets are 47 bytes in size, of which 31 are available for recording data.  It is not yet known how much more they will become in the new version. <br><br>  The ability to send packets to undetermined recipients without a connection is widely used by so-called " <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBeacon">beacons</a> " - miniature transmitters that periodically transmit broadcast packets that can contain location information, replacing the in-house GPS system, advertising and other localized data, such as about the exhibits of the exhibition. <br><br>  Perhaps the first devices with Bluetooth 5.0 will appear in early 2017.  Increasing the speed and energy efficiency is used in new gadgets for the "smart home" and wearable devices. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/372379/">https://habr.com/ru/post/372379/</a></p>
