Since ancient times, people have dreamed of super powers and supernormal abilities, which was reflected in a large number of epics and tales about heroes, gods, and how ordinary people became equal to them. </p><br><p>  And if in the myths of ancient Greece superheroes usually had a part of divine blood, and in modern films and manga superheroes usually became such under random circumstances (spider bite, experiment of scientists, etc.), in literature and philosophy of Asia it often depended from the man himself. </p><br><p>  Moreover, there were various structures (they are sometimes called traditions, lines, systems, etc.), which accumulated knowledge and practiced methods that lead people to what we would call superpowers now. </p><br><p>  Here we touch one of the basic methods that has been used since antiquity for the hacking of reality - meditation. </p><br><p>  Although my goal is to write everything in a simple and understandable way, but there will still be a few terms, research, perhaps it will be boring.  However, those who want to properly understand what meditation is and how reality can be hacked with it - welcome under cat. </p><br><p>  BONUS - probably we all love wonders.  How about increasing your brain's performance and prolonging life?  In the article we will look at the first hack of reality for extending a vigorous life, teach you how to use it, provide scientific evidence of its effectiveness and how to check how it worked on the physical level. </p><a name="habracut"></a><br><blockquote>  As day is replaced at night, so constantly in order a person appears, changes, is destroyed, is created. <br>  Neither suffering nor pleasure, nor any sensation, nor the appearance and destruction is permanent for man. <br>  An elusive time plays with all living things in a cruel game, where happiness suddenly passes, leaving everyone sad. <br>  The philosophical text of Hinduism ‚ÄúYoga Vasishthi‚Äù, approximately 6-10 centuries of our era. </blockquote><br><h2 id="chto-takoe-meditaciya">  What is meditation </h2><br><p>  First, let's understand what meditation is.  There are so many things around the term that the meaning is now not so simple to understand. </p><br><p>  The term itself came from India, but to refer to it when translating, they used the Latin word meditatio - meditation.  In the original, in Sanskrit, meditation was called dhyana.  This word, for example, in Wikipedia, is translated as contemplation, ‚Äúseeing with the mind,‚Äù ‚Äúintuitive seeing,‚Äù meditation, concentration, thinking.  Which gives us a hint that this is something related to the mind.  However, for practical understanding it gives a little. </p><br><p>  If you read a <a href="http://vbuddisme.ru/wiki/%25D0%259C%25D0%25B5%25D0%25B4%25D0%25B8%25D1%2582%25D0%25B0%25D1%2586%25D0%25B8%25D1%258F">Buddhist wiki about meditation</a> , you can see that there it is defined as a method of transforming the mind. </p><br><p>  Moreover, this is not just one kind of frozen method, but a huge number of practical techniques that can be both rigidly fixed for everyone and individually applied depending on the mindset of the practitioner.  Buddhism, which is the most densely used method of meditation and studies a lot of them, emerged around 500 BC and to our time a huge number of practitioners and scientists have continuously used and improved these methods to transform the mind in their chosen directions. </p><br><p>  So, we will try to give a definition for the purposes of our article.  Meditation is a method for working with the mind, most often (but not necessarily) consisting of thinking on a given topic and focusing the mind in some described way, which is aimed at transforming the practitioner's mind in the chosen context. </p><br><p>  For example, we may feel greed overwhelms us and wish to regulate this state.  To do this, we can begin the daily practice of specially developed meditation, usually 10 to 30 minutes a day and, after some time, this state should return to normal. </p><br><p>  Of course, you can change your mind in different ways, modifications can be useful, strange, useless, harmful, etc.  Especially in modern times, when in social.  networks are starting to post on this topic do not understand what.  This particularity of modernity works in all areas - for example, we can recall the battles with vaccinations, homeopathy, etc. </p><br><p>  And modern medicine itself, which works with the body, which is supposedly simpler in structure than the mind, often ‚Äúchanges readings‚Äù - at first something is harmful, then as it progresses it turns out not to be harmful, then it is generally useful.  A typical example of many similar ones is cholesterol.  Review <a href="https://geektimes.ru/post/281784/">article about this case on Hyktimes</a> . </p><br><p>  The same thing may well happen and when working with our mind, they wanted, for example, reducing stress, applied some method, and got a completely different, for example, nervousness.  Therefore, as always and everywhere, it is necessary to apply our well-developed brain to question everything, not to take anything on faith, to check everything. </p><br><p>  About what we chose the method of meditation and why we consider it reliable - later in the article. </p><br><h2 id="chto-takoe-haking-realnosti">  What is reality hacking </h2><br><blockquote>  A hacker is a person who is interested in studying the details (details) of programmable systems, studying the issue of enhancing their capabilities, in contrast to most users who prefer to limit themselves to studying the necessary minimum. <br>  Wikipedia </blockquote><p>  Each of us lives in his own reality - work, home, family, friends, hobbies, etc.  And few of us would not want to hack this reality.  That is, it does not work until the loss of the ability to work while fulfilling all the required social obligations to the death, but somehow to take and hack the reality.  In this case, we do not consider chemical hacking - alcohol and all sorts of more powerful substances, there is enough literature about it and so.  In this case, usually, in the perspective of many years, most of the substances (with rare exceptions) result in a much worse reality than it was before. </p><br><p>  How about in dreams to fall into magical realities and live a second life there?  Or dying carried away to other worlds and stay there consciously?  Or to live in this world not ~ 70 years, gradually fading and dumb, but fully and vigorously ~ 100 years?  Such hacking usually causes us, geeks, an interest that can be seen in the articles here and in the popularity of fantastic literature. </p><br><p>  To go to the hacking for a start, let's understand the term reality.  What it is?  Even an overview article on wikipedia provides many definitions and characteristics of this term. </p><br><blockquote>  Reality (from lat. Realis - real, real) is a philosophical term used in various meanings as existing in general;  objectively manifested world;  a fragment of the universe, constituting the subject area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe relevant science;  objectively existing phenomena, facts, that is, they really exist.  There are objective (material) reality and subjective (phenomena of consciousness) reality. <br>  Wikipedia </blockquote><p>  This definition is one of many - in some philosophical systems we can read very different from it, however, we take it as a basis in order to move on. </p><br><p>  Of course, you can cheat and take a subjective reality, describe it and tell you that everything works.  Happiness is more, dreams are brighter, mood is better - hurray. </p><br><p>  However, we will complicate our task and take the hardware term: </p><br><blockquote>  Reality is an objective reality, that is, matter in the totality of its various types.  Reality is opposed here to subjective reality, that is, the phenomena of consciousness, and is identified with the concept of matter. </blockquote><p>  And now we can go further - how to give an example of the hacking of objective reality through meditation?  To do this, we need to take some material object and prove that we can change it just by meditating for some time every day.  Here we go? </p><br><h2 id="kak-meditaciya-menyaet-obektivnuyu-realnost">  How meditation changes objective reality </h2><br><p>  Of course, it would be cool here to bring all sorts of videos and photos of how rainbows appear on meditation retreats, holes themselves form in the skull for consciousness, how we can change the temperature of our body and sit in a sheet in the Himalayas in winter, meditating for days, eating a cup of rice in day.  But we don‚Äôt have The X-Files here, so let's go where we usually go to Pubmed. </p><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/ud/vt/nn/udvtnn75roltphmtwbsbhtjjzsa.jpeg"><br><p>  <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29016274">A source</a> </p><br><p>  In the picture you can see the hype (HYIP) around meditation.  The main reason, from my point of view, is that by satisfying a lot of needs, the people of the secured world were face to face with the fact that this did not solve the problems of the mind and the level of happiness, perhaps this level was even lower than it was in less secure times .  Pelevin wrote about it ingeniously: </p><br><blockquote>  ‚ÄúOn the right, the shooting of twelve Somali pirates on the barge of Aluta,‚Äù said Sophie.  - At the left - the founder of the international rejuvenation courses, Elder A. Zakling understands that during the morning shave that he is no longer young.  The same, the same output of the unit "M5". <br>  ‚ÄúRight,‚Äù I said.  - Apollo talked about this.  What can be a humane way to collect more bablos than inhumane.  The Great Frequency Revolution ... <br>  ‚ÄúThe frame, the‚Äú M5 ‚Äùunit is suffering.  What does ‚Äúhumane‚Äù mean?  Which gives a decent picture on the screen?  Without shit and blood?  This is not humanism, Rama.  This is the ability to cover up traces ... ‚Äù <br>  <a href="https://libs.ru/book/197/">The Book of Batman Apollo, Pelevin</a> </blockquote><p>  Faced with the fact that the satisfaction of the material needs of happiness does not bring, people began to look.  Since, in the 60s, the neuro-freedom movement lost to consumer government policies, in which research on psychoactive substances was shifted to the criminal zone, meditation has become one of the new areas of study. </p><br><p>  Since the late 1960s, many Buddhist meditation schools have opened in the United States, where Buddhist masters who fled from Tibet and many other masters of Buddhist traditions taught.  They were well-educated people with great experience in meditation and working with people. </p><br><p>  Buddhism and its practices began to be studied in universities, scientific research began to be conducted, more and more meditation centers were opened, which gradually led to the modern Haypu.  As always, during the HYIP, a lot of muddy personalities and incomprehensible branches arose. </p><br><p>   <code>site:https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/ meditation</code>   ,    6700 ,   276   .</p><br>
