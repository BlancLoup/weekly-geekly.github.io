Is it true that genetics are giving gifts to someone generously, and leaving someone with a constant feeling of hunger? <br><br>  True.  And in our <a href="https://atlas.ru/gentest">Atlas</a> there are several examples that confirm these words. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/37c/79c/db1/37c79cdb19bd40f594818dba2bee4c7f.jpg">

    <a name="habracut"></a><br><br><h2>  <font color="#807CFF">BHLHE41: sleep for wimps</font> </h2><br>  This gene encodes a protein that is involved in DNA transcription (rewriting text when copying) as a suppressor.  In addition to this important work, the BHLHE41 gene is responsible for regulating circadian rhythms - our biological clock.  In part, they are associated with external factors - the change of day and night, but by their nature are endogenous: even in isolation from sunlight and the daily rhythm of the planet, we will go to bed and wake up.  The human cycle is 24-25 hours, of which we need to sleep 7-8 hours.  However, mutational variations of the BHLHE41 gene can make their adjustments to our schedule: some of the lucky ones, by their genetic nature, manage to get enough sleep in 5-6 hours. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/34a/33d/53c/34a33d53c4074f6e92715c3668c408d9.jpg"><br><br><h2>  <font color="#807CFF">ADH1B &amp; ALDH2: I'll stop drinking tomorrow</font> </h2><br>  Two genes encode enzymes that are involved in the metabolism of alcohol - alcohol dehydrogenase and acetaldehyde dehydrogenase.  The process takes place in two stages: first, ADH1B breaks down ethanol to acetaldehyde - and alcohol intoxication ends there.  But the hangover begins: acetaldehyde is poisonous, and its presence in the blood causes poisoning with all the consequences: headache, nausea, dizziness.  This continues until the second enzyme ALDH2 is finished with acetaldehyde and turns it into vinegar (hard and safe in the small concentration in which it is formed). <br><br>  The well-coordinated work of two genes helps the body to cope with alcohol so quickly that you do not have time to talk nonsense with drunken eyes or suffer a hangover (the real James Bond).  Deviations in the work of these two genes lead to interesting consequences.  If the first ADH1B gene works well, and the second ALDH2 is bad, the alcohol will quickly break down to acetaldehyde, but things will not go beyond that.  A pleasant intoxication will quickly evaporate, and a long severe hangover will occur: a red face, rapid heartbeat - everything we associate with alcohol intolerance.  If, on the contrary, the first gene shirks from its work, and the second quickly splits the hangover poison, you will find a long state of intoxication, no hangover, in the morning with a cucumber.  It sounds very attractive, but don‚Äôt be in a hurry to envy such superpowers: since you don‚Äôt have to pay for feeling bad for drinking, these superheroes have a higher likelihood of alcohol dependence. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/264/9cc/69c/2649cc69c5704b06b695a78234fedca9.jpg"><br><br><h2>  <font color="#807CFF">FTO: close the fridge</font> </h2><br>  Fat Mass And Obesity Associated - this is the full name of this gene, which encodes an energy protein and is responsible for the overall metabolism.  The work of this gene is associated with the onset of satiety.  A certain variant of a gene can lead to the fact that for some it comes late: for example, about twenty minutes after the body is really full and has received everything necessary.  Naturally, twenty additional minutes of overeating can lead ‚Äî and lead ‚Äî to obesity.  And genetic superheroes with a normal version of the FTO gene can eat and not get fat (although they eat a little). <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/fbd/2d7/728/fbd2d77282a74e22a582a45ca33889ea.jpg"></div><br><br><h2>  <font color="#807CFF">TAS1R3: and get away from the cake window too</font> </h2><br>  Another reason for the increased weight (and glucose level in the blood) is the love of sweets.  Evolution played a very bad joke with us.  At the dawn of humanity, she taught us to choose sweet foods: they were more likely to be nutritious and not toxic.  But after a couple of millions of years, the same gene, instead of leading us to useful products, leaves us alone in front of a sparkling high-calorie highlight showcase with cheesecakes, profiteroles and eclairs.  Someone is lucky: their sensitivity to sweets is normal, and dessert is not so important for them.  The rest - unhappy with a reduced feeling of sweet - it is always small and you always want more. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/a03/81e/b28/a0381eb285b64aadbbb3867c441f022b.jpg"><br><br><h2>  <font color="#807CFF">FTO / SLC30A8: run in the morning <s>every day</s></font> </h2><br>  Once out of nowhere appeared extra pounds, we go to the gym.  But even here disappointment awaits us: someone practices every day and quickly gets in shape, while others have to squat more and pull themselves up - and it seems that everything is wasted.  In the fitness club, the FTO gene, which is already familiar to us, plays an important role: in addition to the desire to eat, it also determines the efficiency of physical activity and the rate of burning of fat mass during physical activity.  Someone, alas, has to work harder to achieve the same or lesser results. <br>  Another gene, SLC30A8, encodes a zinc carrier protein that is involved in the synthesis of insulin.  He is responsible for the speed of recovery after exercise.  The wrong genotype can increase the recovery time up to 48-72 hours between workouts: it will be more useless to practice more often. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/14d/511/e71/14d511e71f01482999cf73a717ec3d4a.jpg"><br><br><h2>  <font color="#807CFF">CCR5: HIV Resistance</font> </h2> <br>  The rapid burning of fat mass or the inevitability of the will to sweet look like toy superpowers in the face of a real superman: the HIV resistance gene.  CCR5 encodes a chemokine receptor protein, which plays an important role in the immune system.  A specific gene mutation makes it impossible for HIV to attach to a T-cell: it's like a congenital and lifelong vaccination.  People with such a genetic "vaccination" (homozygotes) are only 1-2%, about 18-20% more heterozygotes ( <a href="http://www.nature.com/ng/journal/v16/n1/abs/ng0597-100.html">data on the European population</a> ), but this option does not provide complete protection, but only reduces the risk.  Unfortunately, there is a side effect: it seems that this type of CCR5 gene increases the risk of West Nile fever and multiple sclerosis. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/6f9/0e2/209/6f90e22098624436a7174b6b7d7bf3be.jpg"><br><br>  Most likely, any reader of this text has genetic superpowers.
