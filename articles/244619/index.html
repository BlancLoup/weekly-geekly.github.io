In my opinion, the most technically rich and large-scale of all similar in Russia. <br><br>  I liked the presentations of last year, and I decided to take part in Java - this year‚Äôs bacchanalia as a speaker.  In the article I offer my view on events, the quality of reports, as well as the opinion of Comrade.  Dzhigurdy on the release of Java 9. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/187/041/623/187041623d9442bf8cfc605013782f24.jpg">

      A few months before the conference, I sent an application to make a report on it.  After the selection for a couple of months I received a long-awaited confirmation, as well as the good news that I will be performing first on one of the tracks. <br><br>  It would seem that after accepting the application, I, as usual, will be able to play a pipe in the dudu and do nothing, to sculpt a presentation slowly.  But it was not there!  I had to go through a strict pre-listening and a couple of trainings before handing over the final version of the report to the organizers.  Keep this in mind when you yourself will send applications to this team of maniacs! <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Following the <a href="http://jokerconf.com/">link,</a> you can familiarize yourself with the schedule of the conference: it‚Äôs superb that there were practically no reports in the conference program where the speaker would ‚Äúsell‚Äù the technology or his company to the public.  The reports were presented by professionals, techno-evangelists, who either create the technology themselves or use it so actively that they are in some way ‚Äúgurus‚Äù in their field. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/c98/dac/f6e/c98dacf6ecf5b3fe10c5e8e4ee152a0a.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Further I will simply describe those reports that I remember the most or somehow influenced my psyche. <br><br>  The day began with a futuristic keynote from Odnoklassniki, represented by Oleg Anastasiev, in which high loads on one of the most popular social networks in Russia were compared to the Eiffel Tower, the Egyptian pyramids and other wonders of the world. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/e9c/5e0/ee1/e9c5e0ee11d65a10bf4a8b04bf6c1abc.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Then I went to invigorate my audience not only with the morning coffee promenade, but also with a story about how to use Java as the main working tool of Data Scientist. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/f71/92a/5f4/f7192a5f4bdfc90b70b249edd05ffe19.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Presentation slides are available <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/zaleslaw/java-for-data-scientist-zinoviev">here.</a> <br><br>  Also, I submit to your attention a video of my report. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/dXKs26ySPHw%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700022,15700186,15700191,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhjxgC80G_olfx7rdwRhSVXmkR_BkQ" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  In the story, I tried to combine both my experience of working on relevant projects in the Tamtek company and the results of my own research, offering the audience some way to evolve a Java developer in Data Mining engineer. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/e44/f37/251/e44f37251e83c0d22e2fc643fe783d52.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  The Petersburg public turned out to be quite good-natured and non-aggressive, having overwhelmed me with brainwashing cases and questions after the report.  In general, highly motivated listeners are caught. <br><br>  Meanwhile, on the sidelines there was a discussion of the ‚Äúpower plant into one programmer force with a heart from Raspberry Pi and a Java Embedded brain‚Äù <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/136/ff9/399/136ff9399dbfee175f632d6a5876510c.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  After dinner, I wanted to sleep, but Christoph Engelbert &amp; Peter Lawrey with their <a href="http://jokerconf.com/">Unsafe Java World</a> story about the incredible opportunities and dangers that you can get in your code if you start using the right and left functions from this package.  Slides with contacts of the speakers are available <a href="http://de.slideshare.net/ChristophEngelbert/jokerconf-2014-unsafe-java-world">here</a> . <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/e50/db7/908/e50db7908c31e3acff88c40b86de8b98.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  The Olympic torch of humor and hardcore was picked up by Gleb Smirnov from Deutsche Bank with his report ‚ÄúHotSpot, what are you doing ?!  Ahaha, stop it! ‚ÄùIn which he climbed into such depths, but with such a serious look that it was hard to resist not to start reading a lot and abundantly about HotSpot.  Link to the presentation <a href="http://gvsmirnov.ru/docs/presentations/java-mysterious-hotspot/joker-oct-2014.html">here</a> . <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/002/fc4/a4e/002fc4a4e91a15de8e1cb93a1c2a104c.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  But most of all, on the first day I was inspired by the duel of the three Spring gurus, who in real time solved several tasks for configuring Spring through code, XML and Groovy kodo - configs.  Friendship was trying to win, but the dominance of Groovy - the preacher Baruch Sadogursky in the mental field decided the outcome in favor of Groovy in my heart.  Month of use, normal flight! <br><br>  Also, to all young Groovy-fans we strongly recommend another report by the above author with a large number of practical problems solved with the help of this Javapod-like language.  Slides are available <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/jbaruch/groovy-puzzlers-joker-2014">here</a> . <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/cee/12f/822/cee12f822a6d5791df15327831e9472d.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  The second day began with a viral implantation of Djigurda-Joker into our heads.  This moderately enlightened character broke a couple of myths about himself, and also intelligibly and simply explained how to correctly use viral video in his career.  I could not resist and learned from the outrageous guru to do the top selfie.  At my request, he thought for a moment about the prospects for the release of Java 9 and the Jigsaw modularization virus project. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/042/7ef/f65/0427eff65ef06670d5e4a132b3c4e4b6.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  A video of Dzhigurda's performance is available <a href="http://youtu.be/nXpBGdBc7_k">here</a> and <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3Dq70oxxQXR1c">here.</a> <br><br>  Then the local popular science gang of the rap gang appeared on the scene, in whose readings about the <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3DJueEkg9rn6g">completely black body, the</a> <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3D14Ko-ioh90M">fate of the programmer</a> , the <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3DCTVikgHgwoI">tester</a> and the <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3DN07ApkLeInU">Java developer,</a> you can hear a deeply experienced experience!  Listen, you will not regret! <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/79b/7c8/0e2/79b7c80e2a5ee7262d79f31e548a9b5f.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  The flow of reports brought the opportunity to look into the abyss of multithreading along with Nikolai Alimenkov, the organizer of Java - conferences from Kiev.  He skillfully fought off the theoretical harassment from the hall and imprinted in us his own ways to get even with lokami and semaphores in the code.  His presentation is available <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/alimenkou/concurrency-in-practice">here</a> . <br><br>  In the second day, there was a greater emphasis on code parallelization issues and the further development of Java, which will allow not to write code in two versions (single-threaded and multi-threaded), as often happens with many developers. <br><br>  At the end of the day, Yevgeny Borisov showed the latest efforts of the Spring Data project to cover all possible ways to get Java data from a source of any arbitrary type, be it Cassandra, MySQL, MongoDB, universalizing the approach to working with data, without attaching to driver implementation features. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/8fb/b3d/7a4/8fbb3d7a471b0ded25c1295a3ea3c454.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Much remains beyond the scope of this article: aftepati and barcamp (unconference) on the third day, nationwide fraternization with Dzhigurda and foreign speakers.  And finally ... <br><br>  Look at these faces!  The most thoughtful part of the Java community was gathered in one place to break through to the next professional level.  I think we did it! <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/ff5/d49/152/ff5d49152445ddb60a51e93d52349475.jpg" alt="image"></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/244619/">https://habr.com/ru/post/244619/</a></p>
