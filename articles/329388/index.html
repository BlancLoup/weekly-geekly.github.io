Announce: <br><br>  On November 3-4, St. Petersburg will host the <a href="https://jokerconf.com/"><b>Joker 2017</b></a> Java Conference.  Last time we gathered more than 1000 participants, we had more than 40 speakers in 12 tracks, who performed for 2 days.  That will be this time, read under a cat. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/146/503/3f9/1465033f9e0b43bd82f227c2db9caaa2.JPG"><a name="habracut"></a>

    <h2>  <b>Program</b> </h2><br>  Joker 2016 was marked with a record 12 tracks (6 parallel tracks with reports and another 6 with discussion zones) and dozens of reports.  The reviews were from enthusiastic "now in every slot there is where to go" to the separated ones "why are there so many interesting things happening in parallel?" <br><br>  How many tracks there will be this time is not very clear.  Not less than 4 + 4.  To make it convenient for everyone, the program committee will decompose reports in such a way that in one time slot there are no similar topics and you would not have to choose between Shipilev and Kuksenko. <br><br>  We sincerely hope that Oracle, Red Hat and IBM will agree, and by November we will still see the ‚Äúnine‚Äù and will be able to pick up reports not about what to expect from it, but about what we got.  In the meantime, I suggest you look at the names of those who have already scheduled performances on Joker 2017: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/df1/69b/473/df169b47332048e3993385d1070bf416.JPG"><br><br><ul><li>  <b>Norman Maurer, Apple Inc.</b>  - The developer from the Cloud Infrastructure Engineering team at Apple, who also heads the <a href="https://github.com/netty">Netty</a> project, will tell you about the sticks of the JVM that are put in the wheels of developers of high-powered network frameworks. </li><li>  <b>Alexander Borisov, Google</b> - a report from the developer of a platform for IoT, dedicated to the creation of reactive microservice architecture, problems of its construction and frameworks, allowing them to be solved. </li><li>  <b>Alvaro Hernandez, 8Kdata</b> is an expert in working with repositories of all kinds and maste.  Now the program committee chooses one of the three proposed topics, but its report will definitely focus on the internals of the construction sites: interop, performance, data types. </li><li>  <b>Tagir <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/users/lany/" class="user_link">lany</a> Valeev, JetBrains</b> - one of the regulars of our Java-conferences, consistently occupying a place in the top 5 reports Joker / JPoint / JBreak.  Stream gurus, IDE inspections (A) and stream inspections. </li><li>  <b>Nikolay <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/users/xpinjection/" class="user_link">xpinjection</a> Alimenkov, XP Injection</b> - another Java veteran.  We will now see which of the reports that Nikolai will submit to <a href="http://jeeconf.com/">JEEConf</a> will ignite to the maximum, and choose it for Joker 2017. <br>  Or maybe there will be two while we think. </li><li>  <b>Charles Nutter, Red Hat</b> - JVM developer at Red Hat, lead engineer for the JRuby project.  Usually drowns for hardcore, telling completely unexpected aspects of the virtual Java-machine. </li><li>  <b>Baruch <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/users/jbaruch/" class="user_link">jbaruch</a> Sadogursky, JFrog</b> - well, everything is clear.  DevOps and the coolest demo from Silicon Valley gurus. </li></ul><br><h3>  Special guest - Sergey <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/users/milfgard/" class="user_link">Milfgard</a> Abdulmanov, Mosigra </h3><br>  There are no IT people of the former, Sergey demonstrates the wonders of the engineering approach to the business of managing a network of stores of board games, each article causing a stir on Habr√©.  On Joker you can meet and grind ‚Äúfor life‚Äù with the legend Habr.  In his keyout, he will tell you how to develop 8 times more board games, without increasing the team 8 times. <br><br><h2>  <b>Accept reports</b> </h2><br>  If you want to talk about something hardcore and new Java-community - <a href="https://jokerconf.com/cfp/">give us a report</a> ! <br><br>  If you have already spoken somewhere and have met a warm welcome from the organizers and the audience, show us the videotape of the report - this will significantly speed up the decision making by the program committee and increase your chances of performance.  Class performances in the past is one of the important criteria that traditionally guides our program committee. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/954/f5c/165/954f5c1658f44f08891b5d68dbbda38f.jpg"><br><br>  Beginners should not be afraid either - we will definitely communicate with everyone.  Moreover, if your topic is fresh and interesting, we will do everything to hone the content of the report, the technique of performance, timings and presentation, in general, to prepare the perfect report with you, for this we even started a special section in the blog. <br><br><h2>  <b>Exhibition and stands</b> </h2><br>  At Joker 2016, it turned out that the sponsor zone is becoming more and more like a full-fledged exhibition.  Not only the guys from the already familiar EPAM / OK / Luxoft stood with the stands, but the participants could communicate with the engineers from Red Hat, Azul Systems, JetBrains (about Kotlin and IDE (A)).  This time we plan to increase the number of stands, dragging foreign colleagues (communicate with Zeroturnaround and Hazelcast, for example). <br><br>  In reality, the exposition has turned from a ‚Äújob fair‚Äù into a real exhibition: you can talk for hardcore, discuss projects and have fun - there was a lot of things, from the banal kicker to HTC Vive and robococcus. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/2a2/4be/08f/2a24be08f77f4aa885f29a3c0490fe92.png"><br><br><h2>  Location </h2><br>  Like last year, the conference will be held at the Expoforum Exhibition and Convention Center.  Yes, go far.  Yes, for a long time.  But it's worth it.  The problem is that more in St. Petersburg there is simply no place in which 1000+ people can breathe deeply. <br><br><blockquote>  <i>It was convenient and comfortable at the site - there was plenty of space to just walk, there was no feeling of a crush</i> </blockquote><br>  Until June 1, the early bird price will be valid, by the way.  If you plan to register ‚Äúfor your own‚Äù - it makes sense to <a href="https://jokerconf.com/tickets/"><b>register now</b></a> . <br><br>  PS If you have any questions / wishes / clarifications - you can find us in a separate Telegram-chat: <a href="https://t.me/jokerconf">t.me/jokerconf</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/329388/">https://habr.com/ru/post/329388/</a></p>
