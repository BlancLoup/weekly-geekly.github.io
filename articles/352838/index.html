    <h3>  What we can already do </h3><br>  The first block is introductory.  The students installed Android Studio and got acquainted with the main components of the Android platform, learned how to launch and transfer data to the Activity, interact with Fragment, save simple data in SharedPreferences, show toasts, including custom ones.  Students disassembled explicit and implicit intents, learned to show dialogs and work with standard interface elements. <br><br>  The first stage of the program consisted of 12 video lectures, 17 live coding sessions.  To consolidate knowledge, students completed 9 tests and 5 tasks in the framework of the graduation project - creating their own application.  Go ahead. <br><br><h3>  What we learn in the second block </h3><br>  In the second block, the teachers of the Academy - Azret Magometov ( <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/users/nullpex/" class="user_link">nullpex</a> ) and Marat Taychinov will teach <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/users/nullpex/" class="user_link">how</a> to work with databases, display lists and work with the network.  Students will learn the basics of multi-threaded and reactive programming.  Ahead - 11 video lectures and <br>  35 live coding sessions.  We reduce the number of tests - instead of them there will be 15 practical tasks;  more time is devoted to developing your application. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/-f/dv/tf/-fdvtfvyhjdur0xu2_6pbqha5ha.png"><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/n7/6_/l5/n76_l5vvawfx1sgucvr70wx3iva.png"><br><br><p></p><br> <a href="https://academy.e-legion.com/ios/%3Futm_source%3Dhabr%26utm_medium%3D2nd_course"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/eg/qp/rf/egqprf_apcpkyp4k1iaax3lmqd0.jpeg"></a> <br><br><h3>  What we can already do </h3><br>  During the first six weeks of the program, students were introduced to the Xcode development environment and its playgrounds.  Learned about the features of Swift.  We talked about the protocols and how collections are built on their basis.  Of course, we could not bypass the topic of generalized programming.  In Swift, there are not only generics, but also associated types in protocols that allow you to write requirements for properties and classes without specifying a specific type.  In the first block there were 28 video lectures, 9 live coding sessions, 8 tests and 4 tasks.  The guys started cutting their first iOS application. <br><br><h3>  What we learn in the second block </h3><br>  Our teachers - Yuri Petukhov ( <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/users/gxoct/" class="user_link">GxocT</a> ), Ilya Kulebyakin ( <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/users/kuler_29/" class="user_link">Kuler_29</a> ), Ildar Gilfanov and Yevgeny Khizhnyak - will tell about the user interface.  The program of the second block includes 15 video lectures, 17 live coding sessions, 4 tests and 7 tasks.  Students learn how to work with UIView and UIViewController, create adaptive interface, animations and transitions, as well as learn the basics of debugging applications.  The obtained knowledge is immediately applied in practice - the guys will continue to work on their application. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/jn/mr/lc/jnmrlcmdul5h60amckwff1cfikc.png"><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/ys/e6/4e/yse64e83jqgclzcc4-iw7-j-ly4.png"><br><br><h2>  Your first application </h2><br>  Since the main goal of our program is to make you a specialist, then within the framework of studies there is a graduation project that you will be cutting step by step.  At the end of each training unit, you will implement the next part of your own application.  After graduation, you can safely put the application in the portfolio, show it to your colleagues and employer. <br><br>  Students of iOS programs will develop a social network with the publication of photos, likes and subscribers.  Using the application as an example, students can learn how to download and parse information from the server using native iOS tools.  Will master UIKit to create a user interface and Core Data to store local data.  In addition, the application will support localization, work with the camera and, of course, filters for photos. <br><br>  Students of the Android program will create several applications during their studies.  At the beginning, they will develop an application to view and comment on The Beatles albums: consider standard interface elements, working with lists, authorization mechanisms and network interaction, including a reactive approach, transferring information between screens, saving primitives to the Preferences file and structured data to the database.  In the third block of students waiting for another application, when working on it, they will learn different approaches to architecture. <br><br><h2>  Come to study at e-Legion Academy </h2><br>  Learn iOS and Android development.  The recruitment to the first block of the program starts every two weeks. <br><br>  <b>We are not starting from scratch.</b>  Basic knowledge of software development and familiarity with the principles of object-oriented programming are useful for comfortable learning.  Knowledge of English will also help - we will study the documentation and understand the assignments of methods and variables. <br><br>  <b>We study online.</b>  All training takes place on the OpenProfession platform.  You can study at any time and from anywhere in the world. <br><br>  <b>Teachers are always in touch.</b>  We discuss tasks, difficulties and bugs in Telegram-chats. <br><br>  <b>The program lasts 9 months.</b>  We do not believe that it is possible to master the profession of a mobile developer in a couple of weeks.  To obtain fundamental knowledge, it is necessary to study the theory and repeatedly apply it in practice.  At the same time, you can plan your own downloads: if you are behind or behind your group, you can always roll back or join the group that went ahead.  All study materials and progress will continue. <br><br>  <b>All materials will remain with you.</b>  They will be available in your account.  In addition to video lectures and live coding sessions, teachers made collections of materials for independent work.  Suddenly you will want to delve into some topic.  Another bonus is that all the code used in the lectures will be available in separate files so that you can study it. <br><br>  <b>Participate in the employment program.</b>  All students who complete the program will receive confirmation of their skills - an OpenProfession certificate, and will also be able to participate in <a href="https://academy.e-legion.com/career/%3Futm_source%3Dhabr%26utm_medium%3D2nd_course">the employment program</a> .  You will be able to get the position of the juna, because we give fundamental knowledge, familiarize you with the community of developers and help with the use of skills in practice. <br><br><h2>  The experience of students of the Academy </h2><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/fb/6a/xk/fb6axklurslugwprry480ftychi.png"><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/de/b6/vk/deb6vkmqfx5uavha_ictjltkpxa.png"><br><br>  Ready to study?  Then <a href="https://academy.e-legion.com/%3Futm_source%3Dhabr%26utm_medium%3D2nd_course">let's get started</a> ! </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/352838/">https://habr.com/ru/post/352838/</a></p>
