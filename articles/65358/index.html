Who is the risk to start up?</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  I saw somewhere the game ‚ÄúSimon Says‚Äù - when the presenter, on behalf of some simon, gives the command to do something, and all the participants do it, without asking why or why. <br><br>  Here such a social sit down would be fun, geo-referenced.  Like anyone who wants to send a team there, and everyone who wants to be a participant will receive this command and they will carry it out.  The sending team indicates the area on the map within which this team should appear to the participants. <br><br>  This type of remedy for boredom.  Who has nothing to do - he can glance (or subscribe) to the open pool of commands and do any of his own taste.

      To fulfill commands that are not difficult and not too lazy to perform - it can be fun, and the openness of the interface for sending regular commands is a certain guarantee that they will not run out - and at any time one or more teams that can be executed will be available to him. <br><br>  Razvlekuhi, flash mobs - well, really, maybe some kind of cunning terrorism - through this thing they promise to be funny.  In case of mass scale, operational mutual assistance is also possible - such as the team ‚Äúrun to bring greens with cotton to a sharply slowed down bus at such and such a stop‚Äù sent into a circle for about ten minutes from this stop, after which a dozen players rush with greens. <br><br><br>  This is the idea I dreamed of in the morning and I hurry to write it down. <br><br>  UPD: In the comments they say that already existing <a href="http://youdo.ru/Tour/">YouDo.ru</a> and <a href="http://world.en.cx/Faq.aspx">Encounter</a> projects are similar to this.  So probably another start is not worth it. <br><br>  Although, YouDo focuses on feedback - pictures or videos, and tasks, and Encounter - something serious, but in a terribly acid design.  And they have - ‚Äúit‚Äôs not enough to be strong, you still need to be smart and creative.‚Äù And this is also a weak interaction and interaction. <br><br>  I'm talking about something non-stressed.  Like, a person logs in to the site - and he is given one assignment on a topic preferred by a person from the pool of relevant ones.  Like, the answer to the question "why would I do this?"  And the button ‚ÄúI will do‚Äù (adds to the meaning of favorites, so that later a person can press the button ‚Äúdid‚Äù) and the button ‚Äúno, I will not do it, let's do something else‚Äù. <br><br>  Now that I have googled about this: <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  First, the lines of the charred, immediately attracted <a href="http://subscribe.ru/catalog/rest.funny.pulse">Mailing - The game "Simon says</a> . <a href="http://subscribe.ru/catalog/rest.funny.pulse">"</a>  With such a preface: <br><br><blockquote>  There is such a simple game "Simon says." <br>  <b>The leader says what to do - the players do.</b> <br>  Naturally, it all depends on the unbridled imagination leading. <br>  And from the liberation of the players, of course. <br><br>  The presenter arrogantly believes in his imagination. <br>  Worth checking out. <br></blockquote>  True, dead - only a few teams in 2005, because the lead one and very few people lost the idea.  And the teams are not very exciting - like wash the cup and drop the book (here is a <a href="http://subscribe.ru/blog/rest.funny.pulse">digest</a> ) <br><br>  Well, about the <a href="http://www.kinopoisk.ru/level/1/film/171895/">film</a> , this game was popularized from America around the world, and it is exactly called that - everyone already knows Google, too.  And to find something besides this, his knowledge is not very easy :) <br><br>  <a href="http://alfaprazdnik.ru/papers/100igr/100igr_1056.html">Here is a description of the game</a> for children's matinees - there the leading child sometimes commands not on behalf of Simon, and children who have executed such a team are accused of carelessness and drop out.  Those who do not execute the command given on behalf of Simon also drop out as well.  The last attentive leads the next con.  Commands touch any movements - raise your hand, jump, etc. <br><br>  The English wikipedia has an article <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simon_says">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simon_says</a> <br>  It says that it was not Simon who originally spoke, but Cicero%). <br></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/65358/">https://habr.com/ru/post/65358/</a></p>
