Applead decided to share its experience in this matter.  Today, there are more than enough applications in the markets and many of them use the same proven channels. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/5b7/bff/617/5b7bff617600427c94373e085b568d38.jpg"></div><br>  Before you make your promotion plan, which should include at least two components, you need to answer a few questions: <br><br>  <b>1)</b> What is the quality of the application? <br>  <b>2)</b> To whom the application is directed, the target audience (this question had to be asked before starting development) <br>  <b>3)</b> Who are the main competitors? <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  By answering these questions, you can clearly define the path of the mobile application.

      For promotion, you can use the following channels: <br><br><blockquote>  1. Offline advertising <br>  2. Contextual advertising <br>  3. Targeted advertising in social.  networks <br>  4. Social networks <br>  5. Press releases <br>  6. Reviews on thematic resources <br>  7. Reviews on youtube channels <br>  8. CPI network <br>  9. Motivated traffic </blockquote><br>  Let us examine each of them, we define all the pros and cons. <br><br><h3>  1. Offline advertising </h3><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/f2b/282/fda/f2b282fda6f94fba8b5b091569c69f60.jpg"><br><br>  Offline advertising includes TV ads, posters, billboards, print media and other methods that are not related to the Internet.  Advertising posters in public transport or leaflets with a QR code, so to say ‚Äúcheap and cheerful‚Äù are relevant for Russia and Ukraine.  Advertising on TV is expensive and therefore rare. <br><br>  <b>Who is suitable?</b> <br><br>  If we talk about TV advertising, then this option is suitable for applications that do not have a narrow target audience that have already taken their place in the market.  It is worth noting that the method is expensive and it can be used, provided that the application is not just uploaded to the Play Market or the App Store.  Otherwise it will be unnecessarily expensive and ineffective. <br><br>  For example, in the United States, during the showing of the final match of the National Football League, Clash of Clans commercials were broadcast.  The result met expectations, but the cost was more than $ 9 million. <br><br>  Posters in transport, flyers and other similar options - for applications with a wide target audience. <br><br>  <b>"Behind"</b> <br><br>  ‚Ä¢ Wide audience reach <br>  ‚Ä¢ Maintaining the image <br><br>  <b>"Vs"</b> <br><br>  ‚Ä¢ High cost (about TV) <br>  ‚Ä¢ Identification of results (it is difficult to determine how many installations followed about TV advertising) <br>  ‚Ä¢ At the initial stage, low efficiency (about TV advertising) <br><br><h3>  2. Contextual advertising </h3><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/276/c3b/545/276c3b54542b46ce9577db70f3550a3d.jpg"><br><br>  Contextual advertising is a setting and display ads in advertising networks Yandex and Google.  The peculiarity of the method lies in the fact that advertisements will be shown only to interested users.  All this, provided the correct setting and determine the interests of the target audience. <br><br>  <b>"Behind"</b> <br><br>  ‚Ä¢ The advertisement is shown only to the interested audience. <br>  ‚Ä¢ High conversion rate when properly configured <br>  ‚Ä¢ Payment for transitions <br><br>  <b>"Vs"</b> <br><br>  ‚Ä¢ High competition for impressions, due to the fact that advertisers from related areas put higher rates for impressions <br>  ‚Ä¢ Balance between cost and efficiency <br>  ‚Ä¢ If the interests of the target audience and the audience itself are mistakenly determined, the effect will be at the zero level <br><br><h3>  3. Targeted advertising in social networks </h3><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/878/aef/7a8/878aef7a8da882047b10e0ab55d0f27e.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  The method that allows you to customize the shows as accurately as possible and which are aimed exclusively at the target audience.  The main thing to determine this very target audience.  With a qualitative analysis and tuning, the result will meet the expectations.  You can set up advertising in VK via myTarget, and for Instagram and FB through a Facebook page. <br><br>  <b>"Behind"</b> <br><br>  ‚Ä¢ In social networks there is a necessary amount of user data that helps filter out the excess and select all the necessary indicators. <br>  ‚Ä¢ The ad is displayed only for target users. <br>  ‚Ä¢ Pay for transitions, not impressions <br>  ‚Ä¢ A person spends on social networks 70% of the time <br><br>  <b>"Vs"</b> <br><br>  ‚Ä¢ In case of poor-quality settings, ads will be displayed to disinterested users, and this will drain the budget. <br><br><h3>  4. Social networks </h3><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/ec7/0cf/de1/ec70cfde1d6c4236a855ab0fb918eb4e.jpg"><br><br>  Popular method of promoting mobile applications.  The main thing in this business is to correctly identify the communities in which you need to place an advertisement.  Groups should be thematic or entertaining and reach a wide audience.  Depending on the subject of the application, age range and interests of the audience.  You can create your own community and lead it, expanding, adding interesting information or useful content. <br><br>  <b>"Behind"</b> <br><br>  ‚Ä¢ Wide audience reach <br>  ‚Ä¢ Availability <br><br>  <b>"Vs"</b> <br><br>  ‚Ä¢ The cost of fasting in some communities is unreasonably high. <br>  ‚Ä¢ To introduce your own community takes a lot of time and effort. <br><br><h3>  5. Press releases </h3><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/40b/a87/57a/40ba8757a10445cda33b26d2f45a35c2.jpg"><br><br>  Many consider the press release an obsolete method, but still it exists.  And it is worth mentioning it.  Press release can also be done independently.  The main thing here is to determine the list of publications, who needs to be sent.  Highlight the main benefits and beautifully file it. <br><br>  <b>"Behind"</b> <br><br>  ‚Ä¢ Cheapness of the way <br>  ‚Ä¢ Availability <br><br>  <b>"Vs"</b> <br><br>  ‚Ä¢ Non-compliance with current trends. <br>  ‚Ä¢ Not for everyone <br><br>  This method is suitable only for applications that have any features that will be of interest to the user.  And how can you hook. <br><br><h3>  6. Reviews on thematic resources </h3><br>  Reviews allow the user to understand whether this application needs him or not.  There are many resources that specialize in this.  It is important to understand which of them can bring more users.  It is also important what quality the application itself.  Since the beautiful description will not be able to help the ordinary calculator.  Text reviews are accompanied by colorful screenshots and pictures. <br><br>  <b>"Behind"</b> <br><br>  ‚Ä¢ Wide audience reach <br>  ‚Ä¢ Long-term action (after the publication the review remains on the resource, new users come even after a while) <br>  ‚Ä¢ If the application is interesting to the editor, the review can be placed for free. <br><br>  <b>"Vs"</b> <br><br>  ‚Ä¢ If a review only displays flaws or not all merits are shown <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/acf/007/bc3/acf007bc387f48e4887f083586f94f47.jpg"><br><br><h3>  7. Reviews on youtube channels </h3><br>  Reviews on youtube as well as in electronic resources have a high degree of efficiency.  The more interesting the application, the game, the more the user downloads it after viewing the review.  It is very important here that during the review process all advantages are shown, and minuses are minimized. <br><br>  <b>"Behind"</b> <br><br>  ‚Ä¢ Wide audience reach <br>  ‚Ä¢ 99% target audience (channels that specialize in reviews of games and applications are mainly subscribed to those who are interested in this, exceptions are special applications whose audience should be searched on thematic channels) <br>  ‚Ä¢ High efficiency <br><br>  <b>"Vs"</b> <br><br>  ‚Ä¢ High cost on some channels <br>  ‚Ä¢ It is important to correctly identify the resource, the channel for placement, depending on the subject of the application, sometimes it is not easy <br><br><h3>  8. CPI network </h3><br>  CPI (cost per install) - payment for the installation.  CPI networks are an affiliate network, which may include thematic sites, communities in social networks, etc. The point is that the customer pays the networks directly for unmotivated installations.  CPI network takes responsibility for the quality of traffic.  Initially, it is important to put a clear technical task, for which installations will be paid, and for which not.  The customer, if he is not satisfied with the traffic, may not pay for it, but this has its own peculiarities. <br><br>  <b>"Behind"</b> <br><br>  ‚Ä¢ Payment only for installation <br>  ‚Ä¢ Unmotivated traffic <br><br>  <b>"Vs"</b> <br><br>  ‚Ä¢ Possible options for adding motivated traffic <br><br>  <b>9. Motivated traffic</b> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/383/978/0d5/3839780d52ea4afab06b9179e641f286.jpg"><br><br>  Motivated traffic is the installation of the application for a fee.  There are special services that help to purchase the required number of installations, for example, CashPump.  You can distribute the installation by day and time.  Such installations help to quickly get into the TOP. <br><br>  <b>"Behind"</b> <br><br>  ‚Ä¢ Low cost of traffic <br>  ‚Ä¢ Quick hit to TOP <br><br>  <b>"Vs"</b> <br><br>  ‚Ä¢ Outflow of users who were attracted by this method <br><br>  The most popular methods of the above are: <br><br>  ‚Ä¢ Motivated traffic <br>  ‚Ä¢ Reviews on thematic resources <br>  ‚Ä¢ Reviews on youtube channels <br>  ‚Ä¢ Social networks <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/88e/103/8ed/88e1038eda464d54bcbcd7f9749c3484.png"><br><br>  Each of the methods must be mixed with others.  Not one of the methods alone will not give the results that can be obtained by combining the efforts of several. <br><br>  A good result can give a symbiosis of motivated traffic and review on several youtube channels.  Motivated traffic will quickly bring to the TOP, thus attracting organic installations, and reviews will attract organic users, users who are the target audience of the application and are interested in it.  If you can expect outflow from motivated users, then those who came in an organic way, through reviews, will balance the total number of users. <br><br>  Whichever way you choose, it is important to understand what it can give you in return, what you lose and what you gain.  Remember about the features of the application and its topics. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/309468/">https://habr.com/ru/post/309468/</a></p>
