The St. Petersburg <a href="https://vk.com/spbdotnet"><b>community SpbDotNet</b></a> , launched in 2015, became a pioneer.  The Moscow community <a href="https://vk.com/mskdotnet"><b>MskDotNet</b></a> , which has been meeting since 2016, has become a follower of the St. Petersburg community.  Of course, both communities are very good friends and provide all possible mutual assistance.  Since the beginning of the creation of communities, <b>dozens of meetings</b> were <b>held, more than a hundred reports were told.</b>  Fine!  Let's talk a little about the present and future of .NET movements. <br><br><h2>  Today's Day </h2><br>  During the existence of our wonderful community, <b>dozens of meetings</b> were held <b>, thousands of questions were discussed,</b> both in the form of reports and in the form of live communication on the sidelines.  Many met new colleagues, got useful connections, found answers to their questions, got a lot of positives, and some even found new friends.  Those who for some reason do not attend, or can not attend our meetings live - <b>watch our videos on youtube.</b>  By the way, at the moment our <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCHFl23Ah_l4gEUTXYUStQdQ">YouTube-channel is</a> replenished with entries from MskDotNet and from SpbDotNet.  More <b>than 70 videos with reports have been posted</b> on it <b>.</b>  It sounds great! <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/gs/_s/mx/gs_smxjlqwxovucp2dvvwxwxzyc.jpeg">

Of course, the ability to view online is good, but passive viewing online is passive, for those who are just watching do not participate directly in the life of the community.  <b>The most important thing in live meetings is communication and ... networking!</b> <br><br>  In short, there are active people in our country, and according to this, the duet MskDotNet and SpbDotNet can easily grow into a full-fledged orchestra in the near future, since two new communities are opening in Russia.  Meet <b>Saratovsky - <a href="https://vk.com/sardotnet">SarDotNet</a></b> and <b>Krasnoyarsk <a href="https://vk.com/krydotnet">KryDotNet</a></b> !  Urrraaaaaa! <br><br><h2>  SarDotNet </h2><br>  SarDotNet is organized by Nikita Danilov.  Nikita reviews reports, leads the VK group and, in fact, is the leader of the movement.  The first meeting of Saratov participants was held on September 30, 2017. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/-e/ju/lw/-ejulwsufmebmwdveuwj7ndbbu4.jpeg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/jp/p9/qd/jpp9qdah-6lo24sipmw1kmocagg.jpeg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/wq/g-/__/wqg-__mzwcvwy9xx0rfzz6mzpqi.jpeg"><br><br>  Interestingly, the Saratov also hosted the Students Lofty Talk, dedicated to the analysis of the question - what is the .NET Back-end and Web Front-end development.  It was organized by EPAM, with a guest representative from the SarDotNet community. <br><br><h2>  KryDotNet </h2><br>  If you think that the Krasnoyarsk community has just appeared, then a surprise awaits you.  Yes, the .NET-community itself appeared quite recently, but in fact, Artyom Akulyakov (the leader of KryDotNet) and the D2D team have been supporting the programming community for more than three years.  Three years old, Karl!  By the standards of the life cycle of local communities, this is already a lot. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/my/vt/48/myvt48mnnaqtaftc9odo2gea_m8.jpeg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/uo/wo/va/uowovakzdjph9r_wyvylskpa_5e.jpeg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/rq/b7/m6/rqb7m6bmbef26_9pt95kvy8ord0.jpeg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/2v/za/t6/2vzat6q9i6qyvetbfunc95goa18.jpeg"><br><br>  During this time, the guys held about ten full-scale conferences with attendance of up to 500 people, two of which were devoted to dotnet (D2D Just.Net and D2D Enterprise).  Last year, Artyom Akulyakov (the leader of KryDotNet) and the Dev2Dev team decided to change the course, identified several specialized communities and conferences, left one big IT conference about everything.  As a result, KryDotNet, a community of .NET developers in Krasnoyarsk, has emerged, which is part of the global DotNetRu movement.  While there was one meeting.  Plans to hold 4-6 meetings per year.  Congratulations to the guys and wish them every success!  If you are a worker from Krasnoyarsk, <a href="https://vk.com/krydotnet">follow the link.</a>  If you are not a tutor, but an IT specialist and also from Krasnoyarsk, then you <a href="https://vk.com/dev2dev">will be welcome here.</a> <br><br><h2>  Forward to a bright future </h2><br>  As many as four .NET communities are a different matter.  More communities - more reports, more discussions, more HYIP!  But ... there is one moment.  We live in a world where the level of information noise exceeds all reasonable limits.  This fact necessitates the provision of <b>convenient access</b> to information.  If we bring these arguments to the mainstream of our cozy communities, then, of course, it will become obvious that we all revolve around .NET, which means <b>that</b> it is <b>not too reasonable to keep everything that our communities are doing in a scattered state.</b>  All .NET communities share the same principles and similar topics.  The need for some aggregation of communities is not immediately overdue.  Today, especially given the discovery of new sites, the need for globalization of the entire movement has become obvious to the leaders of the movements.  <b>The need for sharing reports, knowledge and news between community members has grown.</b>  That is why the leaders of the movements came <b>to the decision to create an overmind - DotNetRu</b> .  DotNetRu is not a new community, but a common ‚Äúvirtual roof‚Äù for all .NET communities.  What does this give the global Russian-speaking .NET movement? <br><br><h2>  Dotnetru </h2><br>  DotNetRu is a group of .NET independent communities of developers from all over Russia.  We bring together people around the .NET platform to facilitate the exchange of experience and knowledge.  We hold regular meetings to share news and best practices in the development of software products. <br><br>  DotNetRu will be one place where you can watch videos of all reports, read news, share your knowledge or opinion on a particular topic.  This is not just a news portal, it is a real union of Russian-speaking .NET communities.  If you are going to organize .NET User Group - join, together - we are strong! <br><br>  DotNetRu has the following goals: <br><br><ul><li>  get together, meet, discuss news, share problems and find solutions; </li><li>  invite the best speakers, true professionals and unique authors; </li><li>  find and prepare new speakers for the largest Russian conferences; </li><li>  create and maintain a quality collection of video lectures </li></ul><br><br>  DotNetRu works closely with the DotNext team.  If your dream is to speak at the largest Russian .NET conference, but you have never stepped on the stage, then our communities are exactly what you need.  We will help you with the selection of requested topics, the preparation of high-quality presentations and the development of practice speeches. <br><br>  DotNetRu will publish the most interesting news from the world of .NET and issue weekly digests, but you can not worry - there will be no spam in groups of local communities.  In local groups, the events related to a particular city will remain mainly in order to avoid the sensation of news spamming. <br><br><h2>  Application for reports </h2><br>  Developing local communities, especially outside of Moscow and St. Petersburg, is an objectively difficult task.  To be honest, one of the problems is the lack of speakers. <br><br>  Therefore, DotNetRu encourages everyone to apply for reports!  This is not at all scary.  If you already have something to tell about - go forward unequivocally!  If you have material, but it seems to you that it is not enough - contact the representative of one of the communities anyway, often the organizers can tell in which direction you can work through this or that topic.  We will always help with presentations and give recommendations on the development of a particular topic.  You can sit on excellent material for years and be afraid to take the first step towards public speaking.  Believe me, the main thing is to start.  We recommend <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/company/it_people/blog/324352/">reading the interview</a> with the .NET development guru Andrey Akinshin on this topic. <br><br><h2>  Bonuses </h2><br>  Well, if I did not convince you that attending our events is at least useful, that is, a couple more moments.  In December, MskDotNet held a subbotnik with excellent presentations and a fun quiz.  At the quiz, complex (not for Skit) questions on C # were asked, and participants chose answer options via an online service by connecting via their phones.  It was a lot of fun and we got a very positive feedback! <br><br>  Oh yeah, I almost forgot, <b>we played a lot of prizes: a</b> ticket to DotNext-2018 in St. Petersburg, a license for any JetBrains product, a unique book ‚ÄúDependency Injection in .NET‚Äù with an autograph by Mark Siman, smart watches, tickets to a security conference , lots of t-shirts. <br><br>  A frequenter of our mitaps, Jacob Povar received a separate prize - a box of tangerines! <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/df/yn/a7/dfyna72d2q5mo0rkzbhuprebc9a.jpeg"><br><br>  In general, sometimes you can come to our mitta empty-handed, and carry out something useful. <br><br><h2>  Social networks </h2><br>  The main site DotNetRu is still in development and as soon as it is completed, we will release an announcement on social networks. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/e42/2bc/d08/e422bcd0827540fdad85463d2ac4bbd8.jpg"><br><br>  And now you can visit the following links: <br><br><ul><li>  <a href="https://vk.com/dotnetru">VK-DotNetRu</a> </li><li><a href="http://dotnet.ru/"></a>  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCHFl23Ah_l4gEUTXYUStQdQ">YouTube-DotNetRu</a> </li><li>  <a href="https://twitter.com/DotNetRu">Twitter-dotnetru</a> </li><li>  <a href="https://vk.com/spbdotnet">VK-SpbDotNet</a> </li><li>  <a href="https://vk.com/mskdotnet">VK-MskDotNet</a> </li><li>  <a href="https://vk.com/sardotnet">VK-SarDotNet</a> </li><li>  <a href="https://vk.com/krydotnet">VK-KryDotNet</a> </li></ul><br><br>  All videos are posted <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCHFl23Ah_l4gEUTXYUStQdQ">on the YouTube portal.</a>  At the moment, our channel contains more than 70 fascinating technical video clips. <br><br>  However, do not forget to participate in the life of the community more actively: attend meetings and, not least, comment on news and events on social networks. <br><br>  <b>Join the all-Russian .NET-movement!</b> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/334476/">https://habr.com/ru/post/334476/</a></p>
