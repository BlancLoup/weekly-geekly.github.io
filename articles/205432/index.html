However, all these accessories are designed primarily for men - they do not resemble a ladies' pen.  Last week I was with my wife at an electronics supermarket, where a Samsung Galaxy Gear watch stand was found.  I do not like this kind of gadgets very much (the reasons are described <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/smartgadget/blog/195370/">here</a> ), but the concept seemed interesting to my wife.  Everything would be fine, but Galaxy Gear looked on her wrist like ... In general, they looked very inappropriate there.  Approximately like a signet ring on an elegant female finger. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/650/44f/5f4/65044f5f49612b56ebf075816ffe1ce0.jpg"><br><br>  And on the third day I got some Viks Bluetooth bracelets for testing on the Vibro-Bracelet VI-T2, which my dear tried on ...

      This accessory should not be attributed to the class of smart watches, although their purpose is similar;  the hero of this post is more a useful decoration than a clock.  Bracelet focused primarily on ladies. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/216/d20/208/216d2020846d840594a92a12e2183218.jpg"><br><br>  Viks Bluetooth Vibro-Bracelet VI-T2 connects to phones and smartphones via Bluetooth.  When an incoming call arrives, it starts to vibrate, and very noticeably.  Having felt the vibration, the girl must catch herself and get a mobile phone from the bowels of the handbag.  However, it is possible and not to get it: the bracelet can independently take calls, the benefit of the speaker and microphone are provided in it.  (There are two buttons in the device for receiving / rejecting calls, settings, and so on.) But you shouldn‚Äôt abuse it, because in case of lengthy ‚Äúthrough the bracelet‚Äù conversations he will live on one charge not less than two days, but less than one.  And then: everyone around you will clearly hear the details of your conversation, since, in fact, the speaker here is a hands-free system. <br><br>  There is one minus in this whole story, and a serious one - the bracelet can only display the numbers of subscribers.  Their names in the address book - alas.  At least, this is the case with Android smartphones.  An iPhone can also show names, but only if they are ‚Äúcrammed‚Äù in Latin. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/bd7/80c/da6/bd780cda687654514bbe27563cf2f897.jpg"><br><br>  Notifications about the new mail, alarm, SMS and MMS come in the form of a sound signal - in fact, the corresponding melodies from the phone are played.  A2DP music is also played, although, of course, the speakers (even if portable) will not replace the bracelet. <br><br>  The time the device also displays - for this you need to click on the button.  We convey the ardent greetings of the sixth generation iPod nano, which many used just like a clock. <br><br>  The screen of the Viks Bluetooth Vibro-Bracelet VI-T2 is small and not too bright;  white characters are displayed on a black background, nice fonts.  The display is inscribed in the black space - see photos.  The remaining parts of the device may be golden-pearl, black, white or red.  At the same time, I consider it necessary to emphasize once again that the model is primarily focused on women.  Imagine a normal healthy man with such a thing on my hand does not work. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/9ad/3b6/72f/9ad3b672ff1fdca0cf54a9a0476243a4.jpg"><br><br>  The outer side of the bracelet is completely glossy, the inner one is trimmed with something like rubber.  Well, or you can call it a soft-touch, not the essence, the main thing is that the hand is pleasant.  The weight of the bracelet is not specified by the developers, but it does not weigh any more than the average watch.  Hand, he does not particularly. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/ea9/53b/7e5/ea953b7e581e99015d7c7028b99fcc09.jpg"><br><br>  Another useful feature is the automatic activation of vibration at a distance of 10 meters from the phone.  That is, if the lady forgets him on the bedside table in the hallway and runs down the stairs, then there are chances that she will come to his senses and return.  Vibra is really strong - it is impossible not to feel it. <br><br>  Viks Bluetooth Vibro-Bracelet VI-T2 is charged with the help of such a thing: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/26e/9d4/f9e/26e9d4f9ef05a79cfbf3a4e0383e5c4b.jpg"><br><br>  The clip is attached to two pads on the inside of the bracelet.  Not a very elegant solution: the microUSB port, since it's thin, it would look more appropriate here. <br><br>  But in general - a curious thing.  You can give a girl who is not at odds with your phone and regularly misses calls.  Unlike the same Samsung Galaxy Gear, the Viks bracelet is quite feminine.  It costs 3 thousand rubles.  In my opinion, the price is adequate.  But I would be ready to give 4,000 for it if it were not for the moment described above with the display of numbers, and not names. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/205432/">https://habr.com/ru/post/205432/</a></p>
