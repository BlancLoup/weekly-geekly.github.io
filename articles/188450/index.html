      In this article, we will not talk about the advantages or disadvantages of working alone, but consider the situation when individual workers unite under certain conditions into working groups of various sizes. <br>  What benefits can a group of several individual workers bring into the working groups? <br><br>  ‚Ä¢ Satisfying social needs <br>  ‚Ä¢ Benefits from sharing experiences, for example, when an experienced worker shows a beginner how to work <br>  ‚Ä¢ Mutual support, for example, colleagues will always support the one who entered into disputes with the leadership <br>  ‚Ä¢ Basis for self-expression, as security created by group membership always contributes to constructiveness <br><br>  These advantages are sometimes not obvious and exhaustive, there are still many hidden ones, but they are not an absolute plus for all employees.  There are employees who are not comfortable working in a team, in spite of all the positive aspects and the benevolent atmosphere inside.  We are considering those who have not chosen the path of the ‚Äúlone wolf‚Äù on the warpath, and people who feel comfortable united in working groups. <br><br>  Working groups can be primary and secondary, formal (formal) and informal. <br><br>  An example of a primary group can be small departments within a company, design teams, sports teams, or other recreational (wellness) associations based on direct contacts. <br><br>  Secondary groups can be factories, communities, conveyor assembly lines, within which workers do not enter into personal contact with each other, as well as the company's territorial branches.  These groups, as a rule, are less strong and connected than the primary ones, although the personal interaction of the participants is also characteristic of them. <br><br>  Official groups are created by management for a specific, predetermined goal.  Also characterized by a high degree of involvement of management in the coordination of their activities, monitoring and determining the nature of their actions.  The structure of the group is clearly defined in advance, the tasks are precisely defined. <br><br>  An informal group can be formed without any involvement of the leadership.  It is created by people who feel a community of interests.  They develop Group norms, and a certain attitude towards the ‚Äúoutside world‚Äù is formed.  Those.  the group begins to live separately from the "community". <br><br>  An important factor in the formation of relations within the group are group norms.  What is it?  Group norms are views shared by all members of a group on how to act, or on common positions, feelings, and faith.  Standards can relate to production methods, the amount of work that needs to be done, the degree of readiness (enthusiasm) when doing work, the quality of the resulting product, relationships with management, how to deal with different people, as well as a whole range of other problems. <br><br>  For example: if a newcomer enters the group, he in the group will feel isolated and unprotected and therefore will strive to learn the norms established in this group that will guide him in the behavior within the group.  Group norms determine the further development and progress of the team.  If they are not demanding, for example, for quality or strict performance of work on time, then the newly arrived participants will subsequently change this model of work.  And vice versa, if the group sets high goals and is demanding on the quality of performance, then newcomers will quickly absorb this style of work and will try to reach the same level as their colleagues.  We are considering just such a case. <br><br>  How are working groups formed?  For the formation and consolidation of the working group there must be certain conditions: <br><br>  ‚Ä¢ People should be in close contact. <br>  ‚Ä¢ Performed jobs must be related <br>  ‚Ä¢ The group should not be very large <br>  ‚Ä¢ External threat especially contributes to the formation of groups <br><br>  In the formed working group, productivity gradually increases, close cooperation is established between the participants, loyalty arises in relation to the team.  Individuals value the contributions of other members of the group and accept them as they are.  A decision-making system acceptable to all members of the group is established.  Everyone is busy with his work and passionate about it.  This is the so-called stage of cooperation, or performing stage of the process. <br><br>  What kind of behavior is most characteristic of people within a group? <br><br>  ‚Ä¢ Individuals often behave as the group expects, and not as if they were presented to themselves. <br>  ‚Ä¢ The group exerts strong pressure on its members to ensure that their behavior complies with its standards and norms. <br>  ‚Ä¢ Newbies in a group often feel unwanted.  In this regard, groups differ significantly in how individuals differ in their abilities to be or not to be accepted by a group. <br>  ‚Ä¢ Informal leaders emerge in the group, taking turns in accordance with the situation and time. <br>  ‚Ä¢ Because of the departure of old members or the arrival of new members, the character of the group will not change, unless a very influential member leaves it or enters. <br>  ‚Ä¢ The cohesion and consistency of the group's actions is enhanced in the event of an external threat or competition with another similar group. <br><br>  How is group cohesion determined? <br>  The degree to which the group members feel that they are part of the group determines the cohesion of the group.  Cohesion is manifested in the preferential use of the pronouns ‚Äúwe‚Äù instead of ‚ÄúI‚Äù in the conversations of the participants in the group, in the mutual assistance of the group members and the level of perseverance and enthusiasm they show.  The degree to which the group members feel that they are part of the group determines the cohesion of the group. <br><br>  The emergence of group cohesion contributes to many factors, and among them are the following: <br><br>  ‚Ä¢ Team members often have direct contact with each other. <br>  ‚Ä¢ Willingness with which group members support its goals <br>  ‚Ä¢ The degree of common interest of group members <br>  ‚Ä¢ How easy is communication within the group <br>  ‚Ä¢ etc. <br><br>  All of the above leads us to an understanding of what the mythical word team often appears to have heard. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/242/237/c09/242237c099dcdc414a3f642767577d0f.png" alt="image"><br><br>  A team is a type of group.  All teams are groups, but the group will not necessarily behave as a team. <br><br>  ‚Ä¢ The team has its own leaders.  The authority and authority of the team leader - as opposed to the team leader - is implicitly accepted by all team members. <br>  ‚Ä¢ The team leader represents her in the external environment and is officially responsible for her behavior. <br>  ‚Ä¢ A team is more than a group united by one goal.  This is an association of people in which the contribution of each employee complements the work of another, they are linked by a single goal and responsibility for the common result, a team spirit appears. <br>  ‚Ä¢ Team members work in an atmosphere of trust.  The open expression of ideas, opinions, disagreement, etc. is encouraged. Questions are welcome. <br><br>  Sources of such an important phenomenon as the team spirit are: <br><br>  ‚Ä¢ Equitable distribution of work and responsibilities within the group, especially when it comes to unattractive or very hard work; <br>  ‚Ä¢ Clearly developed work programs with realistic deadlines; <br>  ‚Ä¢ Compatibility of personal characteristics of team members. <br><br>  The team spirit is the main motivator and driving force, in spite of all the negative factors inhibiting the process.  Teams with a strong inner spirit can turn unsolvable questions into fully realizable projects, only because of the enthusiasm and positive mood that drives people forward.  Cohesion within the team helps to reduce labor turnover and absenteeism, a more responsible attitude to work and responsiveness in relationships. <br><br>  PS Do not forget, we are a team. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/188450/">https://habr.com/ru/post/188450/</a></p>
