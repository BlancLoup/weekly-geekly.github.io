      I think no one needs to explain that BIG LETTERS HAVE NOT AT ALL RECOGNIZE THE TEXT, that such a text is regarded as a shout or simply "the stupidity of a blonde."  In fact, if you do not look at all the labels that glue to the BIG font its main drawback as I said it is the inability to adequately perceive such text, perhaps it is connected with psychology, personally I feel not comfortable with the person who writes BIG font and as a result - the psychological barrier to communication has its place, I think it‚Äôs not me alone who feels such discomfort. <br><br>  Then I would like to see ALL YOUR VARIATION OF THE ADVICE OF THE TEXT.  The text of this kind is also poorly susceptible, it does not create psychological discomfort, but it is rather difficult to read and, as a consequence, perceive. <br><br>  There are various statuses, like "eat", "busy", "absent" and the like.  It amazes me that the interlocutors often ignore this creation of smart people and it seems to them that status stands as entertainment, as a result - flood (flood, as you like).  Pull it out like this: <br><br>  xxx: <br>  Hello! <br><br>  xxx: <br>  are you here? <br><br>  xxx: <br>  Why do not you answer? <br><br>  xxx: <br>  where missing? <br><br>  xxx: <br>  Alloooooo !!! <br><br>  I think you had to deal with this.  I regard this as disrespect, even if I am - I want to write, the number of messages will not change anything insofar as the user simply either is missing or clearly does not crave communication and he clearly does not intend to change his point of view seeing this.  It is enough to write ‚ÄúHello!‚Äù Or if there is an urgent corresponding message, the interlocutor will come, will be released, will arrive, will come, he will want - he will answer, you can gently remind, but not ten messages. <br><br>  Surely everyone knows the messages of this kind: <br><br>  xxx: <br>  Hello! <br><br>  xxx: <br>  listen to <br><br>  xxx: <br>  I am this <br><br>  xxx: <br>  I wanted to ask you <br><br>  xxx: <br>  how is it <br><br>  xxx: <br>  you do not know <br><br>  xxx: <br>  where can I buy <br><br>  xxx: <br>  soap and rope <br><br>  Reading this, it seems that a person has constipation, and he clearly cannot say right away.  It takes a lot of attention, besides, if there are any ‚Äúnotifications‚Äù (such a thing flashes on the screen it says that a kind person wants something), then the screen turns into a set of relevant notifications, if something is busy - they distract attention very much, instead of In order to immediately write the answer to the finished phrase, you have to wait and transfer all your attention to these windows (sounds) and what the interlocutor wants to say, the result is to turn off the corresponding notifications, which is not always convenient, but necessary. <br>  Give your interlocutor life, all this can be written in one message, phrases like ‚Äúthis is how it is‚Äù to anything, they can be repeated to themselves if without them they don‚Äôt carry any meaning except for irritation. <br><br>  Some have a habit, they rarely go online and when they do it, they consider it necessary to say hello to you.  It makes no sense if you are not going to write anything other than this.  Why do something that makes no sense?  If all my contacts would greet me when they log into the network - I would delete my ICQ. <br><br>  I think that you don‚Äôt have to be intrusive, if you want to talk, the simple phrase ‚Äúhello!‚Äù Is enough, you don‚Äôt need to shower the user with messages than he is there and why he didn‚Äôt answer the written message after a second, I think it‚Äôs not necessary to explain that it‚Äôs stupid a person has his own business, it may be more important than to answer you at the same moment, have patience. <br><br>  Messages like "are you here?" Are also often meaningless.  You can immediately start with what you want to say, you can look at the status, you can write "Hello!", The phrase is appropriate if the presence of the user is strongly required in order to communicate with him online, first you would like to make sure that the user is really using the means described above, so if the user is online, then asking him "are you here" is at least pointless, he is here.  I know there are different people, someone always sits in N / A, someone always online without changing statuses, add them to the list of exceptions and remember those who use statuses for their intended purpose. <br><br>  If they send you a link, it‚Äôs stupid to ask ‚ÄúWhat is there ?!‚Äù, open, look, if you don‚Äôt want to - don‚Äôt open it - don‚Äôt look, the link was sent for some reason, it seemed interesting to the author and it seemed to him that it would be interesting to you if you it seems that this link from this user will not interest you - do not open it, do not answer, ask not to send links, but do not force a person to write a disclosure (description) to your link, this is tiring, besides, interest can be quenched by simply clicking on it . <br>  Remember, not all links are equally useful, and not all should be opened immediately, open only from trusted contacts you trust, otherwise - keep silent. <br><br>  It is not necessary to write ‚ÄúHello‚Äù in response to the link if after this phrase no semantic context follows, it is meaningless, why do meaningless things? <br><br>  I think the letters of happiness are a separate topic, I am able to identify them by reference, and all of their contacts who send similar ones were warned that they would fall into ignore.  The letter of happiness is approximately the text of the following content: <br><br>  10 angels are sitting on a cloud. The most sweet angel at this moment reads this message !!!  Send this message to 10 people and ME !!! <br><br>  It is more or less innocuous, there is about the death of the mother if you don‚Äôt send 500 contacts and about the misfortune of 10 years and about the love that you don‚Äôt find and the devil knows what! <br>  This is nonsense, this is more than nonsense, I used to get 15 pieces a day earlier, sometimes an epidemic begins and they send to all who feel like it, I have to spend the whole day sending such messages, which I consider nonsense?  Be smarter, respect others, if you have nothing to say / send - better keep quiet!  Messages of this kind interest those who send them, remember that there are other people. <br><br>  Further, there are messages like ‚Äúxxx - contact, add it to the ignore, this is an evil virus, the computer is thrown off the window and all data is erased while it is flying‚Äù, probably sending such messages lies in the user's ignorance of what it is.  For those who do not know - do not open unfamiliar links, do not moisten, do not run unfamiliar software, sending out similar messages of nonsense, why?  Vasya decided that he hates Petya, Vasya has 600 contacts, he wrote to them that Petin's address is a terrible virus, after 5 minutes Petya will not communicate with the Internet, because messengers are probably the most successful place to advertise anything. <br><br>  Show some respect for your interlocutors and they will certainly appreciate it, or at least they will not have to write articles of this kind to explain that some things just bother or annoy you, because you will agree if you meet someone you want to talk to, and then he starts talking 50 phrases not letting you put in your own - it is annoying, if he starts shouting at you or distorting phrases - it is annoying, as a rule in life I try not to communicate with people of this type, I try to do it on the Internet too. <br><br>  Not everything is here and not fair to everything, I could only write about myself, this is my modest IMHO, but I hope that someone will still reconsider his views on communication and will begin to communicate differently if he did not do this before after all of the above. <br><br>  Thank you for your attention and good communication! <br><br>  (c) $ lip <br>  <a href="http://dedushka.info/">dedushka.info</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/8507/">https://habr.com/ru/post/8507/</a></p>
