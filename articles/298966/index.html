  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Results and forecasts of the year for online publishers: Social media helps to increase attendance of publications</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  The fact that the media - the brakes, no longer need to prove.  Journalists are like a few urban taxi drivers, and social network users like Uber, that is, everywhere.  Therefore, it becomes more interesting to ‚Äústruggle‚Äù at a higher level - between search engines and social networks, where search engines in the medium term also do not shine, due to prohibitions for search engines (technological or legal), which exhibit large social networks to collect user messages. <br><br>  The pairing of archives / search engines and operational / social media is quite natural, the human brain - with short-term and long-term memory - is perfectly combined and helps to solve numerous tasks. <br><br>  What do publishers, bloggers, people in the dynamic world of the changing habits of growing humanity?  Listen, hear, respond and shape trends.  Next is the translation of the article by colleagues from Parse.ly with a small analytics of popular (for English-speaking readers) materials in online media and suggestions for actions to publishers in the new year.  How consistent - decide for yourself.  Catch the trends. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h4>  How did the public recognize the most popular news of the year? </h4><br>  The Parse.ly team has identified the top 7 news events based on the most commonly read Internet stories.  We took into account only those stories that were based on only one specific event (our apologies to Donald Trump and Kardashian fans!), And then normalized the data on site sizes, because we do not want the largest sites to dictate trends.  After the list of stories was completed, we began to consider where the readers went from to each specific story.

      <br>
      Since the online publishing industry has focused on using social media as an intermediary in distributing information instead of search services, we wanted to see how things are going for each particular story.  And the Parse.ly team analyzed incoming traffic for each of the top news from social networks and search engines.  The results can be found below. <br><br>  On the image - sources of transitions to the most popular news of 2015: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/fd3/797/b30/fd3797b30f474273b9744103b071fb29.jpg"><br><br>  Key findings from data analysis: <br><br>  <i>Bobby Christina Brown:</i> <b>Reposts (and not transitions from social networks or search engines) - a new form of expression of sympathy</b> <br><br>  Probably one of the main reasons that the story of Bobby Katerina Brown attracted so much attention is that it is constantly supplemented by new facts.  The situation changed before the eyes of the readers - Miss Browne was taken away from home in an ambulance, the doctors confirmed that she was in a coma, she regained consciousness after a coma and up to the time of her death - readers used social media to spread the latest turns of the situation among his friends. <br><br>  The number of page views increased at the time of the death of Miss Brown, but not much.  But when we analyzed the data, we found a sharp increase in the number of reprints - 2 times more than at the moment when Miss Brown fell into a coma, and this despite the fact that the number of published articles on this topic has not changed. <br><br>  One of the reasons for the increase in the number of reprints with a low number of further publications on this topic may be the fact that for the users the repost of the article was a form of expression of sympathy for the untimely death of Miss Brown, and the articles did not receive much attention because the users already had a complete picture of what happened. <br><br>  <i>Leo Cecil</i> : <b>Coverage of the development of viral stories for online publishers does not pay off the number of views</b> <br><br>  The story of the lion Cecil was not related to major national trends or news stories, this story was so widespread as it caused an emotional reaction and outrage - two components of a potentially viral story. <br>  According to the data, it can be concluded that viral histories are peculiar ‚Äúone-time miracles‚Äù: the further coverage of the story of the lion Cecil did not cause the same violent reaction as in the beginning. <br><br>  <i>Hacking site Ashley Madison</i> : <b>Psychological features of the event affect the attendance of publications</b> <br><br>  Hacking by site hackers Ashley Madison attracted a significant amount of attention on social networks (34.1% of conversions), but most of the transitions (65.9%) came from search engines.  We assume that users perceived this topic as immoral, but, nevertheless, wanted to learn more about the issue, and at the same time did not want to show their interest to their friends on social networks.  If this is indeed the case, this example illustrates well the influence of the psychological characteristics of a situation on the formation of social traffic. <br><br>  <i>Ahmed Mohamed:</i> <b>Public outrage leads to increased visits to online publications by users of social networks</b> <br><br>  Ahmed Mohamed‚Äôs story had the shortest lifespan of all the stories in 2015.  The local news report caught the attention of the public, the story quickly gained ‚Äúvirality‚Äù, but since it almost did not receive its natural share of search queries, it also subsided just as quickly. <br>  This happened most likely because the story did not receive further development, and readers shared articles in the context of their own views and opinions about the event, and such activities mainly took place on Facebook and Twitter. <br><br><h4>  What to expect in 2016? </h4><br>  Both social and search traffic in response to various news stories attract visitors to the websites of online publications with different efficiency.  And although there are no two identical news as, in fact, two identical topics, online publishers can still study the 2015 user trends to understand what should be given priority in the upcoming year. <br><br>  Based on data from the latest report, it is safe to say that ‚Äúhot news‚Äù is spreading at high speeds in social media. <br><br>  Suddenly pop-up topics (as opposed to stories, long and carefully prepared for publication by the publisher) in 2016 will be promoted mainly due to the interest of social media users.  Sites specializing in such news should invest in increasing their presence in social media. <br><br>  Search engines are less effective in attracting readers, but they still remain one of the most effective sources of transitions to the so-called ‚Äúevergreen‚Äù articles.  Publishers specializing in long-term materials should constantly monitor readers: who read their articles and be aware of the preferences and interests of visitors. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/298966/">https://habr.com/ru/post/298966/</a></p>
