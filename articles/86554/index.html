  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Fraud on the popularity of Opera Mini and Jimm</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Lord habravchane.  Do not fall for yourself and warn your friends - download old and new versions of popular mobile applications Opera Mini and Jimm - only from official sites or trusted sources.  These programs are free and do not require any activations and other actions - download and use. <br><br>  What am I all about?  Yes, because he almost got caught. <a name="habracut"></a><br>  It happened today.  Knowing that Opera Mini came out Opera Mini 5 beta 2, I decided to check out this product.  I downloaded from the official site, tried to log in to Habr√© - did not work.  God bless him, I thought, and decided to try to log in through the java-version.  Again, the version from the official site showed me a big cookie.  A strange phenomenon, of course, given that the 4th version of the popular mobile browser copes with authorization with a bang. <br><br>  Knowing that there are not only official versions of the network, I went in search of any modification of this product.  By the way, before the advent of the 4th version, which is more or less close to the desktop browser, I used mods from the site <a href="http://opera-mini.ru/">opera-mini.ru</a> , I was pleased, but their mobile view in one column did not suit me.

      I haven‚Äôt been on their website for a long time, but when I visited it, I saw that nothing had changed since my last stay, all the same modifications of the single-column 2 and 3 versions, but, I repeat, I want to be happy.  And I went looking for a mobile version of Google with the query "opera mini 5" from my htc touch diamond.  Scrolling through the napv pages of the answers to the search query and didn‚Äôt find anything interesting except news, I didn‚Äôt find it and noticed that two advertisements were visible at the top of the page (sorry, I can't do a search screen). <br><br>  One of them read ‚ÄúOpera mini 5-Turbo - 3 times faster!‚Äù And led allegedly to the site <a href="http://operamini.ru/">operamini.ru</a> , and the other - ‚ÄúOpera mini - Free here!‚Äù With a link allegedly to <a href="http://mini.opera.com/">mini.opera.com</a> . <br><br>  I clicked on the top and found myself on the site that offered me new versions of Opera Mini Premium, Opera Mini 6, and even exclusive modifications like ‚ÄúOpera Mini Vkontakte (Now it's easier to sit on mobile with VKontakte), light versions to save traffic and more.  Slightly below, the same was suggested for the Jimm messenger.  Of course, I didn‚Äôt believe in miracles and travel to the future (I mean Opera Mini 6), but what do the craftsmen call their fashions?  This was after all the paradise of Opera Mini modifications, close to the desktop version (i.e., starting with version 4). <br><br>  By clicking on the 6th version, I downloaded a jad-file into a virtual java-machine, compiled it (everything happened quite quickly), and I, as usually happens with network applications on java-machines, were asked to access the network.  Naturally, I allowed.  This was followed by a second question about ... <b>sending a message to the short number 8055</b> .  I almost did not click purely reflective, thought better of it.  Immediately deleted this "mod" and trudged back to the site in search of truth. <br><br>  It turns out that this is not even operamini.ru, but opera.somewapsite.com.  And below on a black background in dark blue there is a link "Agreement / Cost", leading to <a href="http://ourwap.ru/agreement.php">ourwap.ru/agreement.php</a> .  We read. <br><br><blockquote>  Java registration applications can be found on this site by sending SMS messages from which the user gets access to the download archive for a mobile phone.  To gain access just send only 1 SMS.  If a visitor sends more than 1 SMS, then this is only his personal desire, and he will not blame anyone for that later.  The first SMS from the application is sent to receive the access code, all subsequent SMS messages extend access to the resource. </blockquote><br><br><blockquote>  Applications that mimic Opera Mini or Jimm are games, and are used to demonstrate the application and register in the archive. </blockquote><br><br><blockquote>  Access to the site is paid and provided by sending sms requests through the java registration program.  To obtain and extend access, you must send 3 sms.  Enjoy your time with our website! </blockquote><br><br>  Under the link <a href="http://ourwap.ru/cost.php">ourwap.ru/cost.php</a> you can get a price for SMS (in my case it would be only 40 rubles, but there are both 200 and 300 each). <br><br>  The second link from mobile advertising issued by Google led to <a href="http://jimm-opera.ru/opera.php">jimm-opera.ru/opera.php</a> , the story is the same, the affiliate program is the same (the agreement at the bottom of the page can be seen better than in the previous case). <br><br>  These are the pies.  There is an agreement, you can even see it, if you take a good look, all the warnings and prices in it, and, accordingly, the end user is responsible for debiting money from the end-user account, and the content provider is "no matter what." <br><br>  This is not the only case.  In the vast network of many examples of this kind of legal fraud.  Just be vigilant and warn your relatives and friends. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/86554/">https://habr.com/ru/post/86554/</a></p>
