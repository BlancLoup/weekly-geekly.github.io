    <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  2. <b>Next we proceed to the monitors, or rather we start with their views:</b> <br><br>  <b>* CRT monitors</b> <b><br></b>  <b>* Liquid crystal panels (LCD)</b> <b><br></b>  <b>* Plasma displays (PDP)</b> <b><br></b>  <b>* Organic LED monitors (OLEDs).</b> <b><br></b>  <b>* Electroluminescent monitors (ED)</b> <b><br></b>  <b>* Vacuum Fluorescent Monitors (VFD)</b> <b><br></b>  <b>* Electrostatic Emission Monitors (FED)</b> <br><br>  So I listed all types of monitors that exist. But at the moment we are only interested in <br><br><img src="http://s55.radikal.ru/i149/0906/63/78674db0857a.gif" alt="image"><br><br>  <u>* Liquid crystal panels (LCD)</u> <br><br>  3. <b>Irradiation, real harm or myth?</b>  : <br>  <u>Radiation</u> <br>  It is the mysterious radiation of the monitor that is usually primarily meant when they talk about the effect of the computer on health. In fact, this is far from the most terrible of ‚Äúcomputer‚Äù hazards.  Although it is not necessary to forget about it either.  But we are not talking about them now ... <br>  <b>So what is radiation?</b> <br>  When you hear the word "radiation", first of all you start thinking about some kind of radiation, about something radioactive.  So here.  The monitor is not a source of radiation!  Neither alpha, nor beta, nor gamma particles from the monitor fly out!  The cathode ray tube of the monitor is a source of small doses of X-rays.  In some models of very old monitors, produced in the 80s or earlier and which can now be found somewhere else, X-ray radiation has reached quite a few values ‚Äã‚Äãand could, with daily, several hours a day, work really undermine the health of the operator, including provoke the appearance of various tumors.  But from modern monitors, X-rays are so miserable that one cannot speak of any harmful effects on health. <br><br>  <b>So no ‚Äúcacti‚Äù are needed at all, except for beauty)</b> <br><br>  <u>So what is all this radiation myth?</u>  Unfortunately not...: <br><br>  Electromagnetic radiation and electrostatic fields monitor actually generates.  And their impact on the user's health can be quite tangible, as, in fact, it was with the monitors of old models (again, the 80s and earlier release years). <br><br>  <u>But our state as BE was not sad</u> <u><br></u>  <u>mention it here, it is trying to protect us as efficiently as possible, it is a pity that not everywhere:</u> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/dfa/0db/2d6/dfa0db2d6596483684e4671195e778de.gif" alt="image"><br><br>  The restrictions on electromagnetic radiation and electrostatic fields introduced by the TCO-95 and TCO-99 standards are so tough that the monitors that meet the standards are almost completely safe even for children and pregnant women. <br><br>  4. <b>So what harm does the monitor bring to vision?</b> <br><br>  When working with a computer, unlike reading a book, when you can easily find a comfortable position, a person is completely dependent on the position of the display.  In addition, the screen, being a source of light, is considered an instrument of active contrast (a sheet of paper is passive contrast), which is not so strongly dependent on the intensity of illumination and the angle of incidence of light.  The image on the screen is dynamically updated.  A low refresh rate (regeneration) causes image flicker. <br>  Usually a person looks at the monitor screen for a long time.  At the same time, the ocular and intraocular muscles remain immobile, while they need a dynamic mode of operation. This leads to their weakening. <br>  Long work with a computer also requires increased concentration, which leads to increased loads on the organs of vision.  Visual fatigue develops, contributing to the occurrence of myopia, headache, irritability, nervous tension and stress. <br><br>  Hence we conclude that the monitor does not impair vision, it only undermines its ‚Äúimmunity‚Äù and with the help of other factors ‚Äúthe sun, the light from the bulb and so on‚Äù kills our eyesight ... <br><br>  5. <b>Secure</b> <br><br>  To avoid myopia, headache, irritability, nervous tension and stress, you need to remember that the higher the resolution of the monitor, the more accurate and clearer the image on the screen, and the less it tires the visual system. <br><br>  Exterior lighting indoors reduces the contrast of the image, but do not forget that the increase in brightness tires eyesight.  Glare on the monitor also makes it difficult to perceive information from the screen, forcing you to change the position of the head and body, straining your eyesight.  Not only is the strain on the eyes increased, but also on the neck, back, shoulders and arms, which leads to rapid fatigue. <br><br>  Sources of glare - located near the monitor screen, light sources, light equipment, bright surfaces, non-curtained windows, and even light clothing of the user. <br><br>  There are special self-massage techniques - complexes for relieving eye fatigue, providing effects on biologically active points, as well as exercises to increase muscle tone and relieve stress on individual muscle groups.  The methods of color stimulation of visual and mental processes are also actively used.  Tests of this program showed that it contributes to the improvement of visual acuity (up to 0.1 units in 60% -70% of the examined), reducing the frequency and severity of symptoms of visual fatigue (90%). <br><br>  Personally, I would advise 100% black glasses with a small hole in the center ... for training 20-40min per day, and the result is obvious! </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/100549/">https://habr.com/ru/post/100549/</a></p>
