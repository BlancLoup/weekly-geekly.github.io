Part 1: from idea to product</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/59/df/80/59df802be88ad093151721.jpeg" alt="image" align="left">  Good day, residents of Habrahabr! <br><br>  In this post I decided to talk about how to start your startup and ... not to ruin it, but to build a successful business.  Using the example of personal experience, I will talk about which management decisions are appropriate in certain cases, and which are obviously fatal;  how to set priorities in solving emerging problems so that ‚Äúthe tail of the head does not run away‚Äù and how not to make a mistake in assessing one or another link of the team, so that later it would not be excruciatingly painful;  using the example of a real project, I will show what consequences mistakes can have in managing a startup, how they could be prevented (consequences) and how to get out of the situation when this was not possible. <br><br>  Those who are interested in this topic in detail - welcome under cat. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h2>  Instead of the preface </h2><br>  To begin with, I would like to say a few words about me and the project, which I will talk about as an example.  About 2 years ago, information appeared on the network about <a href="https://rg.ru/2015/07/20/fleshka-site.html">a certain start-up from Samara who invented an ‚Äúendless flash drive‚Äù</a> .

    <div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">The essence of the idea</b> <div class="spoiler_text">  Combine a USB token with an anonymous cloud storage client (it is the client, not the cloud - the same Dropbox and Google Drive also support authorization using a USB token) and file encryption. <br></div></div><br>  Actually, he invented the idea.  And PR, it is really not clear who / what in the first place - the project or yourself. <br><br>  And the product itself - the storage and the client - was developed by me and several other guys.  The same goes for the site.  And many more tasks in accounting, document flow, system administration, technical support. <br><br>  In this part I will talk about the idea and product development and try to adhere to the format: as it should be, as was the case with this project, a small conclusion. <br><br><h2>  Idea </h2><br><h3>  As it was necessary </h3><br>  <b>Proceeding to prototyping makes sense only after confirming the viability of the idea.</b>  Tell your friends and colleagues about it, especially from the area to which it relates.  Make sure that the problem that you think will solve your product is relevant.  Test your idea on potential buyers, for example, create a landing page with a short, literally one offer, description of the product and a form for pre-order and advertise wherever you can.  You should be able to simply and briefly explain what your product is and why it is needed (that is, what problem it solves) so that the person becomes interested in them and, most importantly, wants to buy. <br><br>  Collect and analyze statistics and feedback, both positive and negative.  Especially negative.  This will give you the opportunity not only to confirm the existence of the problem you are solving, but also to determine whether you have chosen the correct method for solving the problem?  Is it right?  What qualities should your product have in order to meet the expectations of potential customers?  These data will make it possible to compile the TK, as well as to understand whether potential customers are ready to pay and calculate the economic component of the idea.  Getting a prepayment is the best proof of the viability of the idea. <br><br><h3>  As it was </h3><br>  Some verification of the idea was carried out and the market was slightly probed, yes, although it was clearly with an air of formalism, as if not for itself, but for investors.  And landing for potential customers was created.  But at the same time, work has already begun on the prototype (and the idea has not yet been tested), the search for investments (without a proven idea and prototype), and also a visit to various startup events, i.e.  everything was done, practically, on the go. <br><br><h3>  Total </h3><br>  At the stage of testing ideas, a prototype is not needed, since you can spend time and money on developing a prototype product that solves a non-existent problem.  Attending start-ups at this stage is a waste of time.  You will be more distracted from the idea than to benefit, especially since at this stage of the startup, in fact, you do not yet have.  Before confirming the idea and creating a MVP about finding investments, it‚Äôs too early to think. <br><br><h2>  Product </h2><br><blockquote>  <i>It‚Äôs better to really make a few people happy with the business than a little to please many.</i> <i><br></i>  <i>Paul bekhayt</i> <br></blockquote><br><h3>  As it was necessary </h3><br>  <b>The prototype is not the first version of the product, it is its prototype.</b>  Remember this.  Highlight the main function of your product and focus on the implementation of this function and everything necessary for it.  For the rest you do not need to be taken.  For example, if we are talking about an Internet service that involves registering users, it is enough to connect a quick login using OpenID, Google or Facebook.  Own registration / authorization, password recovery and profile with the settings in the prototype you do not need.  The design in the prototype is not needed even more.  Everything is simple and minimalist.  Provide an opportunity to ‚Äútouch‚Äù the prototype to users, be it friends, acquaintances, colleagues, anyone.  Listen carefully to the reviews and, analyzing them, quickly modify the prototype - you make the product not for yourself, but for users.  As a result of a series of iterations [testing by users -&gt; collecting and analyzing feedback -&gt; refinement], you will get the same MVP (minimally viable prototype), ready for becoming a full-fledged product.  With a confirmed idea, a calculated economic component of this idea (business plan) and a ready MVP, it is high time to present the project to investors.  Also, when all the quick improvements are left behind and the prototype is ready, it makes sense to think about the design and additional features. <br><br><h3>  As it was </h3><br>  There was an attempt to slip through the stage of a suitable prototype and immediately release the finished product.  This is not always bad, but in this case it was a bad decision.  Because instead of concentrating on the main function, the first was design.  Because the start-up turned out to be a silver carp and wanted the product to immediately have all the best qualities of existing competitors in order to please all users at once, without paying due attention to the opinions of the users themselves.  Because he wanted to immediately expand the still unbuilt business and enter the B2B market.  And this is a gross mistake for a startup.  The love of several is better than the sympathy of many.  And immediately trying to ‚Äúbutt‚Äù with such giants in this area as <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/company/microsoft/">Microsoft</a> , <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/company/apple/">Apple</a> , <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/company/google/">Google</a> , <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/company/mailru/">Mail.Ru Group</a> and others is just silly. <br><br><h3>  Total </h3><br>  Trying to immediately release the finished product, bypassing the prototype stage is not the best idea.  Surely you will need to make large-scale edits and drastically rework the project, and for a full-featured product it will cost much more than for a prototype.  When developing a prototype, focus on the main function and remember that you are making a product for users, adapt the product for them and do not be surprised if their preferences turn out to be completely different from what you expected. <br><br><h2>  Finally </h2><br>  I hope my style of narration will be interesting for you, and the post is useful.  In the sequel, I will talk about important points in choosing co-founders and forming a team, because it‚Äôs no secret that as soon as the word ‚Äúdirector‚Äù appears in a person‚Äôs position, he immediately begins to try to think like a director, which usually means that he starts spending money, as a director.  I‚Äôll also dwell on the financial aspect of a startup, because it is impossible to properly manage the finances of a company while being a spender in one‚Äôs personal life.  And, of course, you can not ignore the legal side of a startup, where there are many "pitfalls". <br><br>  Ready to discuss any questions, my main contacts in the block under the post, all contacts - in the profile.  Thanks for attention! </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/339984/">https://habr.com/ru/post/339984/</a></p>
