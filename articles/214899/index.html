Ah, wonderful new world ...</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/1ce/5ff/f86/1ce5fff86b7978744c8c5e3fb85d633c.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Now in the market you rarely see a game where the text really matters.  Meet - Kaptain Brawe: A Brawe New World!  The fruit of the efforts of a small independent company Cateia Games will not leave indifferent text quest lovers.  Voice acting?  No, not heard.  Only subtitles, only hardcore!  So, a simple "proklikivaniem" of the text will not do.  Have to read. <br><br>  Oh happiness for localizer!  Finally, you can turn around and show yourself in all its glory!  And there is where to turn.  In Kaptain Brawe there are a lot of jokes built on the play on words, the peculiarities of the characters' speech and so on.  In conjunction with the style of drawing, clearly referring us to the creations of LucasArts, the game should have been fun and colorful.  Well, let's see ... <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Localization of the Russian version for the PC involved the company N. I must say, more than a well-known company with a bunch of titles.  However, having lost only twenty minutes to the Russian localization, I was deeply disappointed.

      Get at least the names of the characters.  The main character Kaptain Brawe is translated as ... Captain Brava.  Why wise something, really?  Brave, Brave, Bravursky - yes, how much you could think of!  But no.  Localizers didn‚Äôt bother with names and names at all: Kaptain Brawe - Captain Brave, Kribbs (space pirates) - Cribbs, planet Jama Spacea - Jama Spacey, ship Mazslow - Maslow (well, did it bother to call a ship, say, ‚ÄúMedlenin‚Äù? ..) Well, I think you already understood the trend. <br><br>  Another character deserving special attention is a robot.  More precisely, Rowboat.  And he named developers so not by chance.  And the robot is not simple, but ... wooden!  So in the course of the game the consonance of Rowboat and row boat will be played not only in words but also in deeds. <br><br>  As you have probably guessed, in the Russian version it is just a Robot, without any hints and plots.  And even ‚ÄúRobot‚Äù he becomes only in the dialogues of characters and on close-ups.  On the general plans on the chest of our wooden friend continues to proudly flaunt the inscription Rowboat. <br>  <b><b>Robot - view from the outside ...</b></b> <b>&nbsp;</b><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/681/9f1/75d/6819f175dae72f808b35315182968385.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  <b><b>... and inside.</b></b> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/c0e/8e5/d85/c0e8e5d855dfaf58e12a352874f8b6a9.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  From the beginning of the game, I was looking forward to the moment when Captain Brava decided to cross the swamp with the help of a robot.  In the original, this moment sounds like this: <br><br>  There, rowboat has a propeller.  Now I can use it. <br>  Can't row and can't row without proper drive. <br>  He-he, Rowboat will now serve as a row boat. <br><br>  And this is how it sounds in Russian: <br><br>  Well, the Robot has a screw.  Now I can swim. <br>  I do not have a card, but the Robot cannot properly push off from the water. <br>  Hee hee, the Robot will now be a robot! <br><br>  I think comments are unnecessary.  Name the Rowboat localizers as Robot, you could write something about ‚Äúrobot and bot‚Äù: <br><br>  Well, Robbot has a screw.  Now I can swim. <br>  I do not have a card, and Robbot will not float without a propeller. <br>  Hee hee, was Robbot, became just a bot! <br><br>  <b>The wind walks on the sea and Robot pushes ...</b> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/ca0/e18/ec5/ca0e18ec56072ea78148fe535e041c87.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  The handsome robot-robots also mention space pirates in their conversation: <br><br>  Who, rowboat? <br>  I mean you wow boat I saw you wow awound the swamp? <br>  Not, not Wowboat ... Rowboat! <br>  That's what I said! <br>  Nooo, you said ... <br><br>  Who!  Robot? <br>  This is the lobot-boat, on the kotolom you swim here? <br>  No, not a lobot-boat ... Rozholodka! <br>  I said so! <br>  No, you said ... <br><br>  Robot Boat Robot!  Funny  For me, not so much.  The same unpretentious game "Robbot - Lobbot" would have looked much more natural. <br><br>  But there are good moments in localization.  As can be seen from the previous replicas, the main villain has ‚Äúfiction defects‚Äù.  And on these ‚Äúdefects‚Äù there are also a lot of jokes and funny situations.  Take, for example, the pirates talk about the mysterious killer, whom they call IT with awe and horror. <br><br>  The Big Guy sent HEW to "aid" us in ouw seawch! <br>  Hew? <br>  No, HEW! <br>  What's a Hew, Danny? <br>  IT'S HEW!  A pwonoun fow SHE! <br>  Whoa  She's coming HERE?  NOW !? <br>  If she's coming, who is Hew, Danny? <br><br>  Big Uncle sent her to "help" us in our receipt! <br>  Getting what? <br>  Well no!  RECEIVE! <br>  And what do we get, Danny? <br>  RECEIVING!  MISSION!  Doodles! <br>  Oh oh  And she is going here?  ALREADY?! <br>  I do not understand ... If she goes here, what do we get? <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/482/f07/e99/482f07e990b256303593eb4450ba734b.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/482/f07/e99/482f07e990b256303593eb4450ba734b.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  After all, they can!  They can, when they want!  But, unfortunately, there are far fewer successful moments in translation than those where the translator did not want / could not come up with something worthwhile.  And, maybe, he thought that the Russian user "would come down anyway," because "still no one reads these texts."  And the brave new world of Captain Brava loses his charisma just before his eyes, turning into another adventure game, and also - oh, horror - without voice acting! <br><br>  <i>In fact, we have already published this article, but for reasons beyond our control we cannot post a sequel there, but it should be.</i>  <i>Therefore, we will acquaint you with the authoritative opinion of the head of the quality control department Nadezhda Lynova <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/users/epoha3004/" class="user_link">Epoha3004</a> regarding individual localization points.</i> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/214899/">https://habr.com/ru/post/214899/</a></p>
