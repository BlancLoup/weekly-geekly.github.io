Let's consider one of the components of a successfully operating <i>small</i> online store, the owner of which can no longer cope with the delivery of orders, but is also not ready to create its own courier service.

      In this article we will look at the <b>pros and cons of courier services</b> , as well as go over their tariffs and working conditions. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  <b>Advantages of the COP</b> : <br><ul><li>  No problems with hiring couriers and staff.  Especially true for FE </li><li>  Availability of ‚ÄúPickup‚Äù for clients, if any, at the CS </li><li>  You do not need to follow the good faith of couriers.  The COP is fully liable for the goods transferred to them. </li><li>  The courier himself will arrive and pick up your goods for transfer to the warehouse of the COP, followed by delivery to customers.  Often, it is free with orders&gt; 10 per day.  Or you can do it yourself.  Also free </li><li>  If you are working with a supplier "for the order", then the COP will be able to pick up the order for the client from the supplier </li><li>  Periodic reporting by the CC on delivery orders </li><li>  The <a href="http://geektimes.ru/users/gruxon/" class="user_link">inability</a> to get fake money <a href="http://geektimes.ru/users/gruxon/" class="user_link">Gruxon</a> </li></ul><br>  <b>Cons of the COP</b> : <br><ul><li>  Attitude towards your orders is not as reverent as yours.  In other words, you will run after each client (especially at the initial stage), but they will not </li><li>  Although everyone promises that there is a dial-up of customers after your order appears in the CS warehouse, this is often not the case.  It's a pity.  You have to control the receipt of orders yourself </li><li>  Often, work only with SPb and MSC </li></ul><br><br>  Further we will pass to cash service. <br><br>  <b>Pros</b> : <br><ul><li>  You do not need to buy cash and put it on service.  However, in this case, you can not legally serve customers on their own. </li><li>  Transparency in the calculations.  After receiving money from customers, after some time they get to your bank account.  And to remove them from there for individual entrepreneurs is not difficult. </li><li>  In addition to cash services, some CAs also offer customer service with Visa / MasterCard credit cards.  This is a definite plus. </li><li>  Usually, your p / s is replenished weekly or biweekly.  Sometimes the COP replenish it for 3-4 days after payment of the order by the client. </li></ul><br><br>  <b>Cons</b> : <br><ul><li>  Percentage for cash services (on average from 1.5% to 5%) </li></ul><br><br>  Thus, it turns out that you can earn quite decent money without leaving your home.  What is not a home business? <br><br>  Next, we consider companies that offer courier service <b>along</b> with the cash.  I‚Äôll say right away that I used the services of the O-courier as a buyer, and I didn‚Äôt like them, because after receiving two orders for them, they didn‚Äôt ring off.  As a result, the orders went back to the store, which paid the fine for what reason. <br><br><table><tbody><tr><th>  The cop </th><th>  MSC delivery </th><th>  SPb delivery </th><th>  Self delivery </th><th>  % (cashbox) </th><th>  VISA / MC </th><th>  Crediting funds to the p / s </th><th>  Receipt of goods to the warehouse </th></tr><tr><td>  <a href="http://www.o-courier.ru/contacts.php">O-courier</a> </td><td>  295 </td><td>  295 </td><td>  130 </td><td>  4.5% </td><td>  Not </td><td>  Once every 2 weeks </td><td>  15:00 to 19:00 </td></tr><tr><td>  <a href="http://www.uniexpress.ru/">Uniekspress</a> </td><td>  190 </td><td>  200 </td><td>  70 (MSC) </td><td>  2% </td><td>  Yes </td><td>  Once every 2 weeks / month </td><td>  9:00 to 19:00 </td></tr><tr><td>  <a href="http://www.axiomus.ru/">Axiomus</a> </td><td>  200 </td><td>  Not </td><td>  50 (MSC) </td><td>  1.4% </td><td>  Not </td><td>  3 working days </td><td>  from 10:00 to 22:00 </td></tr><tr><td>  <a href="http://depochto.ru/">Depochto</a> </td><td>  180-250 </td><td>  Not </td><td>  Not </td><td>  1.4% -3% </td><td>  Yes </td><td>  3 working days </td><td>  from 9:00 to 19:00 </td></tr><tr><td>  <a href="http://www.moskk.ru/">Moscow KK</a> </td><td>  200 </td><td>  150 </td><td>  50-100 </td><td>  1.5% </td><td>  Not </td><td>  Weekly </td><td>  Office hours (unknown) </td></tr></tbody></table><br><br>  The list, of course, is not complete and requires expansion. <br><br>  As a small summary, I can say that most companies operating in this market serve only Moscow and St. Petersburg.  And the most tasty conditions for Moscow.  It is, in principle, understandable, because Moscow is the largest market for online stores.  But what then do the regions do?  Are there companies that are willing to work with major regional cities?  Yekaterinburg, Krasnoyarsk, Novosibirsk are the largest cities in their regions with a market that has not been fully developed. <br><br>  The key issue is finding a company that is ready to serve Moscow, St. Petersburg and other major cities in Russia and accept cash as payment for orders purchased from your online store.  I hope that such a company exists. <br><br>  Immediately make a reservation that I do not take into account courier services that simply deliver the goods.  Often, the buyer is simply afraid to fully prepay the goods.  That is the reason. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/92788/">https://habr.com/ru/post/92788/</a></p>
