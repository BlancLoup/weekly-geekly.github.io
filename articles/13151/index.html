I studied at the school, from where I was safely kicked out because of the cruel nature and constant provocations.  Moved to another school.  At that time I just got sick with cars, I forced them, painted and repaired them, installed music, alarm systems.  I was so fascinated by this occupation instead of studying, that in the end I was kicked out of the second school. <br><br>  Then he entered the Chemical Technology College, from where he left, slamming the door.  The teachers could not stand my youthful extremism and show off, ended in scandal.  :) Everything, study is over!  After opened his first business.

      The first business was based on the fascination with metals, now it all degenerated into stupid reception points, and then we went to the factories and bought chips, right up to nickel alloys and melted in our own induction furnace!  This is not wire tyrit, earned a lot of money, enough to almost completely disaccustomed to work. <br><br>  Then the real estate came ... An endless series of apartments, cottages, contracts, taxation, hired workers of embezzlers, all this haze that still does not let me out. <br><br>  With real estate and good money, SEO came almost a year and a half ago.  Having ‚Äúgenerated‚Äù a couple of stupid pages in the front page for the first time, I was surprised to see that no one needs my site in FIG ... <br><br>  <strong>Your offline business cannot be called unsuccessful, why did you get into the wilds of SEO and website building?</strong> <br><br>  No, in fact, initially I turned to programmers and advertisers, they rolled me such an account!  Well, something in the region of 20 kilobaksov for a comprehensive solution, and the question was not even that I could not find this amount, the question arose as to what all this would result in: neither my clear strategy, nor the tools for implementation seo site builders have not seen.  There were hour-long conversations under brandy with heated debates and beating of oneself in the chest, stacks of striated papers. <br><br>  Two months have passed, and I decided.  I created a ‚Äúrich‚Äù website of two pages, but seeing what ‚Äúimpression‚Äù he makes even on me (and parents, as is known in the children of my soul), I, after a pause of a week, mercilessly killed him. <br><br>  After that, I acquired Bitrix Business.  I immediately bought the coolest version, because of the functionality of the sites I had only general ideas and a bunch of soap-and-rainbow bubbles.  (Pii-piii-pii ... censorship). <br><br>  Although there is a result, now I can assemble supercomplex functionals saturated with interactive forms (the notorious Ajax) on Bitrix, with any design and logic, and most importantly, I learned to survive in the intricacies of someone else's code.  Communication with this engine taught me consistency, measuredness or something. <br><br>  Specifically, SEO for me began with the simplest truth that the link gives the desired result, I will not rassmusolivat, for it is spoken and spoken, but I will say this - I use satellites and cross-cutting links in my work, but under a certain sauce.  I donated a myriad of them, about 200, now I glued 90% of the junk domain mass to the main projects, six months later, at the start of the main child, I‚Äôm going to stick it twice more. <br><br>  For this year, I had an idea-fix - I want to get the first domain with PR10 in Russia, which is, of course, foolish childishness, but there is a lot of bzik.  It is possible that this will be completely irrelevant to me in a year.  :) <br><br>  <strong>You can see that you are an inquisitive person and you know the value of your money.</strong>  <strong>Have you ever ordered services from optimizers?</strong> <br><br>  Well, firstly, I believe that every person is his own SEO, you just have to listen to the words and images that arise in your head.  And this is the only reason that I believe that real SEO cannot be hired, a ‚Äúcatcher of the semantic core‚Äù must live in business, know every step, action, listen to a company‚Äôs speech, stories, anecdotes, know what images are in business.  And that, the most disgusting, when the site is good - both fine and creative, you come, and there it is a bjaka.  The consumer, though prone to herd instinct, but immediately feels false.  The real optimizer should live inside the business!  And hired, well, it is usually - bought, received with a delay. <br><br>  <strong>Do you think that prices are steep at cool SEO firms?</strong> <br><br>  If you invest in the concept of SEO only purchase links, then this is a robbery, but if this is a real approach to business with the ‚Äúfeeling‚Äù of conversion along with the client, and not a dull TOP, then it is clearly underestimated, but there are also advantages in this ‚Äî there is room to grow.  :) <br><br>  <strong>You called yourself a Dunno when you came to the forum optimizers, now we can say that you know?</strong> <br><br>  No, I didn‚Äôt become Knowledgeable, and I don‚Äôt think that now it is possible when horizons are expanding every day and new acquaintances, partners, and new information appear.  You can‚Äôt say - ‚ÄúI found out,‚Äù you can simply say with slight regret that your knowledge is outdated.  :) <br><br>  <strong>What traits do you need to have to succeed in your own business?</strong> <br><br>  The most important thing is to feel the string.  If you do not feel a powerful pillar of confidence inside and ‚Äúthrough‚Äù consciousness and personality - DO NOT FRAUD.  But structurally you are educated or not - this is the tenth case.  Some of the primer and receive the primer, some temper the spirit with long workouts, but definitely everyone can.  Charge the batteries!  :) <br><br>  <strong>Do you promote other people's projects?</strong> <br><br>  Yes, of course I promote.  Moreover, I basically do not take up ‚Äúsimple requests‚Äù, I need something that has been crawled over the years, ‚Äúproselyamnye‚Äù and ‚Äúzamylennoy‚Äù, only then the intellect searches for rational ways, fights, and always finds a solution.  :) At the moment, all my powers are given to a grand development, I will not open the details.  This is not a ‚Äúunique‚Äù project, but simply a ‚Äúconvenient‚Äù one, and, of course, one cannot do without a dozen topical highly specialized communities to help.  This is a commercial development and I get paid well.  So while I'm busy. <br><br>  I am constantly asked the same question: show sites.  :) I, out of principle, are only satellites and only direct interested friends and proven people.  Simply, when we mention our name in our troubled business as the owner or promoter of a solid resource, muddy movements immediately begin around.  :) I am not ready for ‚Äúpublicity‚Äù yet.  :) <br><br>  <strong>How could you, having come to the Dunno forum, in just a few months to find clients for promotion?</strong>  <strong>Did your friends help?</strong> <br><br>  Turnip :) (joke).  No, friends are actually a bit of SEO.  I helped people for free.  :), honestly!  I just gave advice, someone corrected the layout, helped me choose links, I also studied :) but I studied hard.  And now they recommend me;  it is important this: and this, you know, Dunno;  official letters are written to me directly and Dunno in the text is written in Russian and with a capital letter ... It's funny, damn it, they don't let me be sad.  :) <br><br>  I did, or helped to do, almost for free about 20 sites, probably, maybe more, for a symbolic single link to the main one.  :) And I help as much as I can to lead projects - people are happy.  :) Well, word of mouth was spread by customers, and they are going slowly, but, I repeat, I'm not an SEO-person, I'm still the creator of the community anymore. <br><br>  <strong>What qualities are you dissatisfied with?</strong>  <strong>What are your strengths?</strong> <br><br>  Dissatisfied with inconsistency, it often happens that, having taken up the business, I do only high-tech things, at the final stage I completely lose interest, so there are a couple of frozen projects.  Rigidity in dealing with people, I often pull myself back and reproach for being too categorical. <br><br>  I consider the strengths of the ‚Äúnon-use‚Äù of my attitudes, that is, what I considered to be right and correct 10 years ago is relevant for me now.  I also consider as a plus the absence of installations and many dogmas in the technical field, I can come up with a non-standard move, it is not trivial to apply an ordinary thing. <br><br>  <strong>What annoys you in life the most?</strong> <strong><br></strong> <br>  I am strained by the passivity of the position, the uncertainty.  Terribly enrage mummy.  It happens that a person seems to say, but instead porridge is obtained.  I always think that it is necessary to think about what you say, the situation does not play a role - even sex with a beauty, even speaking at the podium. <br><br>  Enrages mate in a public place and in business.  Happened, damn it, you come to respectable gentlemen, you discuss everything grandly, but after a couple of meetings from the crony mat, the ears wilt.  Although I like strong words at the right time in the right place, like all spicy ones :) - I love seasonings, greens, adzhiki, sauces, I can eat it all with tons of meat. <br><br>  <strong>What are you catching a drive from?</strong> <br><br>  Drive I catch from young beauties and from the car, the standard set :).  Feeling close to drive appears when projects are debated and obtained on the fly, in the same breath.  This is a special sense of harmony or something, the structure of being. <br><br>  <strong>Can you do without a computer?</strong> <br><br>  I can do without a computer.  Rather, in some areas it interferes, he is used to drawing on paper and cutting metal immediately.  :) And then ‚Äúmudohatstsa‚Äù until blue in the face, now, of course, most of their projects have been driven into digital form, but to be honest, this action killed half of the ideas. <br><br>  <strong>Do you play computer games?</strong> <br><br>  I play computer games.  Moreover, I have a very serious comp, I will not describe, but sooo serious gaming computer.  Basically, I am seduced by shooters, but only with monsters!  I hate to shoot people.  He played Stalker - kinda cool, but tedious, he played DOOM3 recently, BFG is all the same! <br><br>  And, by the way, I dug up the game Space Rangers-2 somewhere, I never played like this, but then I pulled it, I replay it a second time. <br><br>  I played in Greenwood ‚Äúget up huge country‚Äù :) they got me and my office!  Almost a month of working time was gone!  Zareksya show employees of the game with "sercha".  :) Well, Need for speed Carbon, of course!  This is the main hit of the season.  On Saturday, friends come to me, bring beer, turn on the speakers louder and "blacks" rush and press on nitrogen!  :) <br><br>  <strong>How do you plan your work day?</strong> <br><br>  I do not plan my day!  I have a schedule, but there are no PLANS.  The environment in which I spin every day is too dynamic <br><br>  <strong>And finally a few words, what do you want to say to everyone?</strong> <br><br>  Do not stop!  For the next sand dune - an oasis!  :) <br><br>  Shl <br>  In the photo - Sergei was woken up ... :) <br><br>  Source: <a href="http://www.kopernik.name/2007/07/neznayk.html">At the Edge of the Earth</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/13151/">https://habr.com/ru/post/13151/</a></p>
