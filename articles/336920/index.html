New technologies, applications, devices and standards - all this makes the network constantly evolve, and, as in the process of any evolution, survival depends on flexibility and performance, without the right to make a mistake.  Your network is too important to trust its operation in an untested cable system. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/53d/c3d/09d/53dc3d09d9974cc488f6a5f2aecebbde.png"><br><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Leading organizations and businesses around the world are well aware of the SYSTIMAX brand.  Under this brand, CommScope offers complete solutions for designing, building and operating cable infrastructures that cover all parts of the network: starting with connecting workstations, Wi-Fi access points, IP cameras and other devices, and ending with a high-performance data center core.  The basis of these solutions is high-performance copper and optical components, as well as an automated infrastructure management system that provides convenient interfaces for monitoring and managing the network.

      SYSTIMAX solutions are: <br><br><ul><li>  High-performance copper and optical solutions; </li><li>  High-density switching panels; </li><li>  Pre-terminated cable products; </li><li>  Convenient tools for design and planning; </li><li>  Intelligent automatic controls; </li><li>  Warranty, global service, support and training. </li></ul><br><h2>  75% of Fortune 100 companies trust CommScope </h2><br>  Among the competitors' products, SYSTIMAX solutions are distinguished by a unique combination of guaranteed performance and well-thought-out innovations, ensuring the evolutionary development of the network for many years to come.  Even the best-in-class products must constantly evolve to meet changing demands and growing expectations. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/0ae/fdb/1a8/0aefdb1a825a4bf5a7f40f54b42a3eff.png"><br><br>  CommScope experts are well aware that the physical layer of the network must be prepared not only for today's, but also for future requirements.  The service life of cable infrastructure is usually much longer than that of active equipment.  Often, the SCS ‚Äúexperiences‚Äù a change of two or three generations of network equipment, and sometimes a change in the paradigm of building a network.  CommScope guarantees the adaptability of cable infrastructure: you can be sure that with minimal additional cost it will provide support for new topologies, technologies, equipment and applications. <br><br>  As the number of applications using the network increases, its reliability increasingly affects the operation of production and business processes.  One modern server is capable of supporting simultaneous operation of dozens of critical applications, dozens of Wi-Fi users may depend on the functioning of a single channel connecting an access point, etc.  etc.  Even one small problem in the work of network infrastructure can seriously affect the operation of a company.  And the impact is fraught with serious financial losses.  The challenge for IT is to prevent this. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/4c7/002/da4/4c7002da48104de98eac5cb275252da4.png"><br><br>  The high quality and performance of SYSTIMAX cabling solutions make them a solid foundation for networking and applications. <br><br><ul><li>  Intelligent management tools provide a visual representation of the state of the network and allow for optimal use of available resources; </li><li>  SYSTIMAX products allow you to solve the whole complex of tasks on the organization of network connections, providing support for the latest technologies, including NBase-T, multi-gigabit Ethernet, etc .; </li><li>  Ultra-low-loss optical systems make it possible to increase the length of communication channels or the number of connections in such channels. </li></ul><br><h2>  From the creator of the first SCS </h2><br>  When we say that CommScope is always at the forefront of technology, this is not boasting.  The company's engineers were the first to develop many solutions that later became industry standards. <br><br>  Take, for example, the actual SCS.  The concept of structured cabling systems was born at Bell Laboratories in the mid 80s of the last century.  Prior to this, cable connections were organized on a point-to-point basis, based on proprietary technologies, and the replacement of IT equipment often required a complete replacement of the cable system.  The main idea of ‚Äã‚ÄãSCS is the formation of a universal cable infrastructure with the installation of connection points (information outlets) throughout the building.  This idea was implemented in the PDS (Premises Distribution System) system, which later became shipped under the SYSTIMAX brand. <br><br>  Since then, SYSTIMAX SCS has been constantly developed and improved, and its scope has been expanding: today it is successfully used in intelligent buildings, data centers, etc.  One of the most recent inventions of CommScope is wideband multimode fiber (WBMMF), in which using the SWDM (Short Wavelength Division Multiplexing) optical multiplexing technology you can ‚Äústack‚Äù several (four) spectral channels.  Such fiber is referred to the new class OM5.  The new technology will help not only reduce the number of fibers used for parallel transmission systems, such as 100 and 400 Gbps, but also achieve higher speeds, such as 800 and 1600 Gbps Ethernet.  This makes it an ideal universal transport medium for today's and tomorrow's tasks. <br>  An impressive list of inventions CommScope confirms its technological leadership, and therefore, with its decisions and you will be ahead of the competition. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/628/a38/b79/628a38b7920f4f73ae02076cc4f2585a.png"><br><br><h2>  High speed migration </h2><br>  CommScope offers a full range of solutions for high-speed migration - High-Speed-Migration (HSM).  It includes modern copper-fiber and optical cable systems, including high (HD) and ultra-high (UD) density solutions, using the latest types of transmission media (including OM5 fiber).  The company offers modular, highly scalable solutions that provide flexibility and adaptability to new applications, a painless transition to higher speeds with maximum preservation of the investment made. <br><br>  The most important component of the HSM solution portfolio is the imVision automated infrastructure management system.  Providing real-time 100% reliable information about connections at the physical level, it provides the most valuable data necessary for the design and error-free execution of migration scenarios. <br><br>  Also in the HSM portfolio includes network design tools.  In particular, they allow you to calculate the maximum line length and the number of connections to support the necessary network technology, taking into account the type of fiber.  At the same time, it is possible to take into account the possibility of supporting the technology that is planned to be introduced at the next stage of the network development. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/b8c/38c/1a5/b8c38c1a573a49a59f351f167d5cf3c2.png"><br><br>  With the tightening of network infrastructure requirements, the use of high-quality components of such infrastructure is becoming increasingly important.  They should be developed not only taking into account the current tasks of the customers, but with the anticipation of future applications, which is impossible without the supplier having serious expertise and powerful R &amp; D. <br><br>  Another important factor is the supplier‚Äôs understanding not only of the specifics of his ‚Äúpiece‚Äù of the project, but also of common tasks, for the solution of which it is often necessary to work at maximum efficiency.  Not only high-quality products and deep expertise are needed, but also convenient tools that allow you to intelligently design the network, taking into account the features of passive infrastructure and active equipment, as well as current and future tasks of IT and business in general.  All this provides CommScope. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/336920/">https://habr.com/ru/post/336920/</a></p>
