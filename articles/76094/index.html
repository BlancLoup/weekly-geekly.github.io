  <section class="page js-page"><h1>In Ukraine, withdraw servers</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  The Security Service of Ukraine goes on the warpath - in two days several sites of a political orientation are closed and the equipment of one of the largest providers in Dnepropetrovsk is withdrawn.  Day of Freedom Day, which the country celebrated on November 22. <br><br>  On November 19, the SBU officers seized all servers hosted by the provider Fregat, Dnepropetrovsk.  Before continuing, it is worth noting that ALL servers, including those not owned by Fragat, but purchased by clients for the allocation of their resources, were withdrawn ABSOLUTELY.  On one of such servers, there was an information resource gorod.dp.ua, which was oppositional to the city authorities. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a>  The reasons, according to the SBU two.  And one is funnier than the other.  The first is the distribution of information in violation of copyright (pirated software, movies, music, etc.).  The second is the dissemination of sensitive information.  It sounds convincing if you don‚Äôt know what is hidden under it - the base of GAI numbers, which can be bought on any computer market, and on Kiev Petrovka there are also bases of legal entities and individuals.  Why then the SBU does not remove the discs there?

      The first reason is just a pretext, says Tatyana Popova, head of the board of the Internet Association of Ukraine: ‚ÄúIn fact, today you can close any resource under this.  Because any service that has the ability for a user to post any information is not able to control what is on her server.  Which may lead to the fact that any publication can thus be closed. "  The SBU apparently does not understand that the Internet provider is not simply unable, and should not control the information passing or being on its servers. <br><br>  All servers are indefinitely withdrawn.  The provider is charged with raiding and copyright infringement, as well as the distribution of secret documentation.  All emails from users whose north were illegally withdrawn remain unanswered.  In particular, specialized industry portals of the company Network Media <a href="http://www.derevo.info/">www.derevo.info</a> , <a href="http://www.proelectro.info/">www.proelectro.info</a> , <a href="http://www.harchovyk.com/">www.harchovyk.com</a> , <a href="http://www.meblevyk.info/">www.meblevyk.info</a> as well as the websites of the Media-Group Prominfo publications ( "Electrotema", magazines "Angelyatko", "Angelyatkov science", "Real Home", "Management Practice", etc.) <br><br>  In total, several hundred Internet resources have suffered because of the actions of the SBU, which are still not available. <br><br>  In this light, the statement by the head of the Security Service of Ukraine Valentina Nalyvaichenko made on November 20 in Brussels about the protection of cyberspace looks more interesting nowhere: cybercrime, cyberterrorism.  Where there are absolutely direct calls for insurrection or rebellion, there we have the right to withdrawal.  But these are not the powers that European or Russian special services have in the fight against terrorism.  It is necessary to provide more legal grounds for both the SBU and the Ministry of Internal Affairs. ‚Äù <br><br>  This is not the end of the sad news - those who are waiting for the servers to return with their information may not wait.  On December 5, 2008, the servers of the largest Ukrainian file sharing service, Infostore.org, were withdrawn from the data center of Volya‚Äôs provider due to allegations of pornography distribution.  Servers are not returned until now, the resource is not working, user information has not been restored. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/76094/">https://habr.com/ru/post/76094/</a></p>
