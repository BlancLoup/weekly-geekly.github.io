  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Oracle IaaS and PaaS - all for you</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Cloud computing today is extremely relevant for the entire IT market.  Leading IT companies see tremendous prospects in this area, and analytical agencies such as IDC and Forrester predict the growth of the cloud computing market in the areas of virtualization, platform as a service, applications as a service, etc. Both IT giants and smaller companies invest the most serious resources in this direction, actively develop it, which means we can well treat cloud technologies as one of the main directions of development of IT and IT products in the foreseeable future. <br> <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/company/oracle/blog/278347/"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/c36/a8f/f97/c36a8ff971524e49a52f878b4bb5b001.png"></a> <a name="habracut"></a><br>  Of course, Oracle also invests a lot of resources in the development of cloud automation.  Moreover, if we look at the diagram of cloud solutions offered by major global suppliers (Fig. 1), it turns out that only Oracle provides a complete stack of cloud solutions, including HWaaS - equipment as a service.  But how relevant is cloud computing for our country? <br><br>  Our answer to this question depends on whether we believe that the list of tasks being solved, including the cloud, is relevant for our country, namely: <br><ul><li>  Increase scalability </li><li>  Cost reduction </li><li>  Increase the speed of providing IT services </li><li>  Simplified maintenance </li><li>  Technology update </li><li>  Transition from capital investment to operating costs </li><li>  Security enhancement </li><li>  Standardization </li></ul><br>  It is quite obvious that all these tasks are relevant for Russia, and, moreover, due to the specific economic conditions of recent times, the cloud approach to solving them is especially relevant.  And if you ask yourself who is interested in using cloud technologies in business, then it will turn out that it is beneficial for almost everyone.  For developers, who are primarily concerned with the quality of the services provided and the speed with which new services are provided, it is important that, thanks to the cloud, they can have quick access to the latest and constantly updated technology versions.  Heads of IT departments are important such organic properties of cloud platforms, as quick response, quality of service, reducing risks and costs, increasing productivity.  Finally, business users with high quality and speed of cloud systems provide access to new markets, rapid development of new products, ubiquitous access to corporate IT and ease of use. <br><br>  The two main ways to deploy a cloud are a public cloud (supplying cloud services and document storage areas to a large number of clients from large data center resources) and a private cloud (the organization‚Äôs own cloud infrastructure).  The public cloud translates all relevant IT costs into operational costs and provides a quick and inexpensive launch of an IT solution.  In the case of a private cloud, capital investments are preserved - but there is also full control of the IT infrastructure.

      Oracle's approach is based on the concept of a hybrid cloud - the union of private and public clouds, which implements a cross-controlled use of data and applications between them.  Hybrid cloud is very convenient for development and testing, integration of B2B solutions, implementation of demanding IT resources of products, trial operation of new products. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/625/788/d7d/625788d7dec942da809b20d934b5d878.png"><br>  Oracle provides all cloud models to choose from - public, private and hybrid cloud (Fig. 2).  On the one hand, products are offered on the basis of which you can deploy Oracle-systems in the data center, turning them into a private cloud.  On the other hand, there are Oracle data centers around the world that provide public cloud services.  Oracle Enterprise Manager product allows you to combine both approaches, connect one cloud with another and manage them using a single interface. <br><br>  It is important to remind that the cloud is not just a certain number of files on a certain server.  A cloud is a cloud when the provision of services, their administration and payment are automated.  That's why we say that a private cloud is the automation, deployment, and management of IT systems.  Companies with a large, complex IT infrastructure understand this especially well, because it is impossible to manage such infrastructures without automation ‚Äî which is why private cloud is especially important for such companies. <br><br>  The most popular Oracle cloud services now, both in the world and in Russia, are infrastructure and platform services in the public cloud - a database as a service and an application server as a service. <br><br><h1>  <font color="#ff0000">Infrastructure and Platform Services</font> </h1><br>  The two main ways to provide Oracle PaaS (DBaaS) services are as follows: clients work with either Oracle VM virtual machines or Exadata servers.  If clients are running traditional virtual machines, there are several pre-configured sizes of virtual machines for them, which are characterized by a certain number of processors and memory capacity.  The Exadata server-based solution is designed for clients with very large database size and performance requirements.  In addition, it enables the use of Exadata cells for high loads.  See Table for details.  one. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/03d/b60/6ad/03db606adec04affa6c4c97461292740.png"><br><br>  Rapid deployment of databases is possible thanks to a convenient self-service portal, a template catalog that stores a set of deployment procedures as service templates and offers different template options for different DBMS versions, configurations, etc. By clicking the ‚ÄúRequest service‚Äù button in the public cloud interface There are a number of important, technologically complex processes that smoothly and quickly lead to service readiness (Fig. 3).  Oracle is responsible for all stages of the preparation of the service. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/07f/696/53e/07f69653e0f742d5af0754248a0cee5d.png"><br>  The database is provided quickly and securely, there is the possibility of further automatic installation of patches and automatic backups - the owner of the service himself sets how often and in what area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe cloud storage the backup will be performed, Oracle is also responsible for this.  Two database versions, 11 and 12, are available; they are deployed on Linux version 6.4.  All services are integrated to work with different programming languages.  A whole set of tools is used to ensure security - SSH keys (access only for those systems that have a response private key), use of the VPN channel, as well as its own security features of the Oracle database. <br><br>  Currently, there are two options for billing these resources - hourly or monthly payment.  The hourly rate is higher, but relevant for those customers who need to save on night hours, weekends and holidays, when there is no need for system activity. <br><br>  Several additional services work with the database service ‚Äî for example, Enterprise Manager Database Express, which allows an administrator to manage the database through a graphical interface;  service work with APEX-applications;  "Lightweight" application server GlassFish, etc. <br><br>  The cloud backup service can be used both for backing up from cloud to cloud, and for backing up a local database to an Oracle public cloud.  It works with the traditional RMAN utility and runs for various database versions;  Starting with Oracle Database 10, this feature is available for both Enterprise and Standart Edition.  By default, backups compress and encrypt data.  Triple data mirroring, automatic error correction and protection against degradation are used to increase accessibility. <br><br><h1>  <font color="#ff0000">Hybrid cloud</font> </h1><br>  Enterprise Manager 13 is a management system for both public and private clouds from a single interface.  If the workload with databases and applications exceeds the capacity of free servers in the data center, this load can be transferred to the public cloud.  The Enterprise Manager performs two main functions ‚Äî monitoring services, wherever they are, and managing cloning (Figure 4). <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/3d3/b95/5a4/3d3b955a4d2b47d1afbfd3a2959cf005.png"><br>  After installing Enterprise Manager, you need to configure one of the Enterprise Manager agents so that it ‚Äúsees‚Äù over a secure connection that is in the public cloud, and the corresponding agent from the public cloud has a connection with the local agent.  When you install the agent, you choose which operating system you install it on.  By connecting a host in a public cloud, you add a database to be monitored ‚Äî Enterprise Manager will ‚Äúsee‚Äù this database and will be able to manage it. <br><br>  If you see one database in the cloud and another in the data center, you can start the cloning process.  Cloning of plug-in databases is quite fast.  That is, in fact, copying of the files of the connected database and the xml-configuration file.  Cloning is possible both in and out of the cloud.  This functionality is available in Oracle Enterprise Manager since version 12C Release 5. <br><br>  Working with Java applications is similarly implemented: having connected the database and the WebLogic server, you can run applications in a private or public cloud. <br><br>  By providing access to software and infrastructure on demand in self-service mode with the ability to scale and measure, Enterprise Manager provides the following benefits. <br><ul><li>  Improving the quality of service.  IT organizations are striving not only to reduce costs, but also to find solutions that improve productivity, availability and security.  Cloud customers get the natural benefits of high-availability tools built into the cloud. </li><li>  Resource flexibility  The ability to increase and decrease database capacity (storage size and computing power) makes applications flexible and easily adaptable to changing workloads. </li><li>  Expedited provision of systems upon request.  Databases in the cloud can be created very quickly.  This reduces overall deployment time for production applications and development platforms and speeds the creation of debug configurations. </li><li>  Reporting - the ability to quantify the use of database resources in the cloud for budgeting, planning and allocation of administrative resources, depending on the use of resources. </li></ul><br><br>  In conclusion, I would like to emphasize once again that only Oracle offers a cloud with such a large selection of its own solutions.  At the same time, the Oracle offer is distinguished by a unified architecture, standards and products for data center and public cloud, automation of lifecycle management tasks, ready integration between the data center and the Oracle public cloud, as well as between PaaS and SaaS applications. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/278347/">https://habr.com/ru/post/278347/</a></p>
