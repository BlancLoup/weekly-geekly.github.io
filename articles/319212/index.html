And this year we will witness the birth of this new era, with its own characteristics and directions of development.  In our <a href="https://1cloud.ru/blog/">blog</a> on the site, we talked about the cloud <a href="https://1cloud.ru/blog/cloud-digest">technologies of the</a> past year.

So you can squeeze out of the cloud even more benefits.  And the clients attached, for example, only to AWS, will be less and less.

      <a href="http://www.information-age.com/10-trends-that-will-influence-cloud-computing-in-2017-123463713/">Changes in the</a> attitude of companies to using several providers and platforms, or simply switching to new ones, are also expected by other experts.  Customers will be able to learn how to do this easily and naturally, select providers for their business goals, and concerns about migration to the cloud will be significantly reduced. <br><br>  Today, companies use special tools to manage multi-cloud, but existing services support mostly the largest providers.  West Gate Networks President Andrew Frohlich (Andrew Froehlich) <a href="http://www.informationweek.com/cloud/multi-cloud-management-what-to-realistically-expect-in-2017/a/d-id/1327710%3F">predicts a</a> change in this situation. <br><br>  Another problem must also be solved: today, most products from large and reliable companies, for example, from VMware, are sharpened mainly for cloud infrastructures that use other technologies of this company.  In the near future, services will become more versatile. <br><br>  Multi-cloud will become popular in part due to the fact that each company has its own needs and requirements, which are very individual.  But it will also be the cause of the emergence of an even larger number of ‚Äú <a href="https://www.bluefoxgroup.com/cloud-computing-trends-2017/">sectoral</a> ‚Äù clouds, which will be aimed at solving the problems of a particular industry and will be able to contribute to the development of the necessary technologies in the necessary fields. <br><br>  The ‚Äúone cloud for all‚Äù system gave an excellent impetus to the development of technologies and popularization of cloud solutions, but, especially large providers, they cannot quickly respond to the needs of customers that vary from industry to industry.  Therefore, the introduction of more narrowly targeted services in this case is the only possible scenario.  You can read about how IaaS providers are organized today and <a href="https://1cloud.ru/blog/myths-about-cloud-providers-part1">here</a> . <br><br>  There is another trend associated with the multi-cloud approach - the need to manage cloud as a service (CMaaS) to monitor the performance of the cloud provided by each individual independent provider.  It is important that such services will not be provided by the providers themselves: they will only transfer information about their work to such services.  At the same time, CMaaS provides integration with both public cloud services and IaaS and PaaS services. <br><br><h2>  Forward movement </h2><br>  Gartner analyst Thomas Bittman <a href="http://www.computerworld.com/article/3074998/cloud-computing/google-says-welcome-to-the-cloud-20.html">says</a> that although companies have already begun the transition to a hybrid cloud, their percentage is still too small.  Today, about half of all enterprises use only a private cloud, but by the end of 2017, already 50% of companies will use the services of a hybrid cloud. <br><br>  The growing popularity of hybrid clouds will lead to the emergence of cloud brokers who will monitor the fulfillment of all obligations by providers and monitor the operation of the platform.  You can read more about what the IaaS provider can guarantee today.  And brokers will also determine the best ways to manage and protect the cloud.  Analysts 451 Research believe that such services will be the main cloud trend in 2017, and they will arise not only within the company, but also be formed as separate structures. <br><br>  According <a href="http://www.networkworld.com/article/3151002/iaas/10-must-watch-iaas-cloud-trends-for-2017.html">to</a> Forrester Research, companies are interested in moving to more economical and cheaper solutions, combining the capabilities of PaaS and cloud management.  Perhaps a private cloud will be built on a hyperconvergent platform.  Experts expect that such systems will definitely attract attention.  Although while hyperconvergence can provide only 20% of integration, it has great potential for development (see clause 2 in the <a href="http://www.information-age.com/10-trends-that-will-influence-cloud-computing-in-2017-123463713/">source</a> ). <br><br>  Another trend, which analysts predict from Forrester, associated with the change of cloud platforms.  For customers, simplification of <a href="http://cloudtweaks.com/2016/11/cloud-predictions-trends-technology/">migration</a> is coming thanks to the lift-and-shift tools.  Such services will be very popular this year, as they will soften and facilitate the transition, for example, from public to private cloud or vice versa. <br><br>  Many experts predict an increase in the number of services related to the work of the cloud, and this means that theoretically access to data can get more people.  Therefore, Kevin L. Jackson, an independent expert at IBM and Dell, believes that companies will <a href="https://www.cloudendure.com/blog/5-cloud-experts-predict-cloud-computing-trends-2017/">focus</a> on cybersecurity.  This will lead to standardization and automation of technology. <br><br>  Security measures will continue to <a href="https://www.bluefoxgroup.com/cloud-computing-trends-2017/">tighten</a> .  This year, a large number of security tests will be conducted, and attention will be focused on studying customer needs for secure access and data encryption.  We told about our experience in how we take into account the different approaches of clients to security.  As a result, companies will be able to feel more secure, which, in turn, will also contribute to even more popularization of cloud technologies. <br><br><h2>  AI systems and data centers </h2><br>  The priority for cloud vendors will remain the <a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/aarontilley/2016/11/15/google-taps-amd-for-accelerating-machine-learning-in-the-cloud/">development</a> of machine learning technologies and artificial intelligence.  In 2016, the three largest providers (Google, Microsoft and Amazon) announced their products in this area.  And they are not going to stop. <br>  For example, Google plans to use a GPU under the AMD Radeon brand to improve the performance of its cloud services Learning Cloud Machine and Compute Engine.  And in Rick's Cloud, the introduction of artificial intelligence systems will help automate the formation and adaptation of resources for a specific application load or operation. <br><br>  The growth of the IaaS market inevitably leads to an increase in the total number of data centers.  This is because vendors are trying to keep up with the growing demand and needs of customers.  Another reason for the massive construction of data centers - compliance with local laws in the field of data protection and storage.  For example, in 2017, Google <a href="http://www.cloudcomputing-news.net/news/2016/mar/23/google-announces-data-centre-expansion-plans-12-more-regions-2017/">plans</a> to build data centers in 10 new regions.  The company noted that it will also reduce delays and response time. <br><br>  Experts are confident that the cloud market will develop in completely different directions, so not only big vendors can strengthen their positions.  Regional providers will also take advantage of the era of cloud 2.0 and will compete with corporations for their maneuverability and faster response to customer requests. <br><br>  PS Our other materials on the future and cloud technologies: <br><br><ul><li>  <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/company/1cloud/blog/316930/">What could be the work of an IT specialist of the future</a> </li><li>  <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/company/1cloud/blog/314022/">How to make virtual infrastructure more accessible</a> </li><li>  <a href="https://1cloud.ru/blog/cloudfiction3">Cloud Technology Myths.</a>  <a href="https://1cloud.ru/blog/cloudfiction3">Part 3: Talking About Iron</a> </li><li>  <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/company/1cloud/blog/318286/">How we automated work with DNS records in the hosting panel</a> </li><li>  <a href="https://1cloud.ru/blog/service-level-agreement-dogovor">The nuances of the agreement on the level of services provided</a> </li></ul></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/319212/">https://habr.com/ru/post/319212/</a></p>
