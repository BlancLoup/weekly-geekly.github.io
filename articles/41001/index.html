  <section class="page js-page"><h1>RIT: High loads, my impressions.</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  A few days ago, a RIT conference was held in Moscow: High loads, which I <a href="http://wolandino.habrahabr.ru/blog/39574/">wrote</a> about not so long ago when publishing the conference program.  Basically, the impressions are positive: a two-day marathon with coffee breaks and lunches gathered a huge audience of gurus, specialists and students under a single roof.  A wide variety of reports, which, despite their fears, were not just a retelling of advertising slogans and campaigns of the companies of the speakers, far from it! <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  This kind of conference is a great opportunity to communicate among people committed to the same business as you - you get real pleasure from communicating with recognized masters, creators of those things that are used in hundreds and thousands of projects - this is both nginx, and sphinx, and much another. <br><br>  Unfortunately, the majority, but thank God, not all speakers are brilliant technical specialists, but inexperienced speakers - it was obvious that not everyone can softly and fully convey to the audience the essence of the problem being raised.  But to my satisfaction, I can say that the ability to speak in the speakers woke up - and they answered questions from the audience with enthusiasm, apparently having already coped with the excitement and that is called, having got into the jet. <br><br>  According to the reports, with great pleasure I will mention Grigori Rubtsov from MySQL AB with the report ‚ÄúApproaches to optimizing MySQL performance‚Äù - just a difficult, good report, excellent answers to questions that even on the sidelines rained down from the horn of plenty.

      But for example, the reports of the guys from the mail.ru about the Imagine framework - their own development of the company on which the company's servers are running, frankly did not like.  Not because they did not speak well or did not prepare themselves - simply by advertising their product, they do not allow it to be used in their projects, that is, in essence, the entire report is written like a pitchfork on water - so I can advertise anything and say that this "whatever" is the best.  I do not understand why make a report in such conditions? <br><br>  Report ‚ÄúLarge-scale Jabber-cluster.  IM and not only ‚Äù- to be honest, I personally didn‚Äôt like - everything that was said there is available from the specifications, but it was said about some architectural features of the system used on some project (which was never mentioned). Little. <br><br>  The second day of the conference was marked in the morning with two interesting reports at once: this is Sphinx in examples and tasks of Alexey Aksenov, who was so carried away that there was almost no time left for questions - for which he paid - in the margins he was simply torn to pieces :) Report ‚ÄúOrganization asynchronous of processing tasks ‚Äùby Yakov Sirotkin from Yandex made him wonder if we are doing everything right.  Well done! <br><br>  The next noteworthy report is the Monitoring of Yandex by Maxim Lapan.  The monitoring system of Yandex is a rewritten zabbix, and Maxim said several times that zabbix was basically reworked in the interface, and talked several times about functional modifications :) <br>  By the way, in this system, after some kind of failure, a text message comes to Maxim's phone (or administrators), so I think after <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/yandex/40930/">yesterday's</a> , I had to turn off the phone for a short time - there were a lot of sms :) <br><br>  In general, all of the interesting :) I would like to hear your opinion about the conference. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/41001/">https://habr.com/ru/post/41001/</a></p>
