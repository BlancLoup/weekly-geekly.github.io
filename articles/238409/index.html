I haven‚Äôt come across ‚Äúsports programming‚Äù for quite a while.  Last time it helped me to go to the university, which I never finished.  I have been developing games for almost 9 years in a row.  At first it was interesting to work.  The server often fell and gave surprises, and now <s>we have learned not to deploy on Fridays,</s> <s>we have learned to deploy on Fridays so that nothing breaks</s> fall and almost no surprises.  In general, once, in order not to be bored, I was engaged in my little projectors, then a little bit of freelance, and at the beginning of this year I managed to remember about programming competitions and sports programming. <br><br>  And the title does not quite match the text of the article, but I really liked it.  If someone decides to read the article to see me without a t-shirt - do not do that!

      <strong>About CodinGame</strong> <br><br>  Codingheim is an online platform for programming contests.  There is an online editor, automated program testing, and even some prizes.  Before the start of the competition (held once a month), it is proposed to tick off interesting employers (they are mostly French), if anyone of them wants to take me to his job.  I am not looking for a job, but following the results several companies asked me to send a resume.  Although the results are more than modest.  Today I found a clause, ‚Äúparticipating For fun‚Äù.  Next time I'll take advantage. <br><br>  In addition, the winners are given gifts.  For example, in the <a href="http://www.codingame.com/challenge/dont-panic">next contest (in a month)</a> the gifts will be: an iPhone, a robot and a drink machine.  10 T-shirts for the top 10 solutions, and a T-shirt for the leader in each programming language (and there are about 20 of them supported). <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  <strong>Briefly about your <s>successes</s></strong> <br><br>  My first pancake turned out to be a lump: I‚Äôm surely that I‚Äôm starting to write, it‚Äôs still an online game.  In general, it is too difficult to write. <br><br>  The second time was more fun.  First, I took as a Groovy language instead of Java.  Programming has become easier and faster.  In addition, it turned out that the best programmer in each programming language put a T-shirt.  And in a couple of weeks, a T-shirt came to me on the wings of the Russian Post.  Competition among those who chose Groovy is not as tough as among Java or C ++ users. <br><br>  The third time was today.  I passed the task 4 seconds later than my opponent with the same result.  Today I got only impressions, which I decided to throw out on Habr. <br><br>  <strong>About today's competition</strong> <br><br>  I will briefly describe today's competition.  Input data: a field, targets and ‚Äúwalls‚Äù on it, several bombs and several moves are given in order to lay them.  It is necessary to destroy all the goals. <br><br>  In general, the solution of programming problems for me comes down to solving the problem in my head.  I thought and decided that in order to destroy all the targets, it is necessary to find a cage, a bomb from which will destroy the maximum number of targets.  Repeat until you run out of targets or bombs.  In the third round - a mistake.  I debug the code, turned out to be a small technical blot, confused Math.min and Math.max.  I start further, the task "to foresee the future" is broken. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/165/3b3/29c/1653b329c27143628756d585ed622199.jpg"><br><br>  You need to lay a bomb on the site of the exploded target.  I thought and added that if there is enough time, you just have to wait, and not plant a bomb.  As a result, only one task was not completed.  It is necessary to plant a bomb in the wrong cell, from which the most targets explode: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/ed2/91b/4f6/ed291b4f6bdd4ffd863b74329ac7e7e1.jpg"><br><br>  I wanted to write a separate check whether it was possible at the moment to put all the bombs in my hands in such a way as to blow up all the targets, but there was little time left, and I did not do that.  Although it would be worth it.  The reason is the most unsporting, I wanted to be the first to pass the Groovy code. <br><br>  CodinGame has <a href="http://www.codingame.com/puzzles">tasks for training</a> , most likely soon (seemingly in a couple of weeks) the task will appear there today. <br><br>  <strong>What would I advise other participants</strong> <br><br><ul><li>  I think Codingame is a good way to try some other language.  For example, someone solved these tasks for Bash!  Next time I want to try on Go; </li><li>  If someone has not tried himself in ‚Äúsports programming,‚Äù it may be worth a try; </li><li>  Debugging is convenient to write to stderr; </li><li>  The first pancake I would have been better if I had first practiced on test problems; </li><li>  For fans of "hack the system" and "unsporting behavior."  Since testing is automatic, perhaps the fastest solution would be to hard-code answers.  I have not tried and will not, but it should work out; </li><li>  It is better to ask the advice of someone who ate the dog on this, not me. </li></ul><br><br>  <strong>And the pitiful babble of justification ...</strong> <br><br>  While I was thinking how best to write that I was in a hurry today, these words of Lermontov came to mind.  It so happened that I had a little more than an hour on my assignment (in general, 3 hours were allotted, but I was late to the beginning).  Saturday, evening, and probably the last warm day off this year.  That's what I need!  87 place <br><br>  PS And the T-shirt that I received for the second competition looks like this: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/ec1/380/201/ec13802017ca4c8595aba15dba69055a.jpg"><br><br>  PPS And for those who do not like CodinGame, there is still <a href="http://www.topcoder.com/">TopCoder</a> . </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/238409/">https://habr.com/ru/post/238409/</a></p>
