It is available at <a href="http://manuals.info.apple.com/en/iPhone_User_Guide.pdf">manuals.info.apple.com/en/iPhone_User_Guide.pdf</a> <br><br>  Read the documentation carefully and try to find something new? <br><br>  In addition, due to the fact that the phone finally got to the masses - reviews became available.

      About all this - below. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h2>  "News" from the documentation </h2><br><ul><li>  Gesture: quickly drag your finger across the screen - fast and far scrolling <br>  Text: if, when typing, to discard the suggested hint and end the word, it will automatically fall into the dictionary <br>  Text: already seen, but if you touch and hold a little while typing, something like a magnifying glass will appear, allowing you to position the cursor exactly. <br>  UI: the included headset allows you to control music: pause / play, next and previous song. <br>  Internet: Internet connection is made in the following order: <br><ul><li>  attempt to connect to the Wi-Fi point that you used last time <br>  if not, show the list of Wi-Fi points to the user for selection <br>  if this did not work out, EDGE is used. <br>  Feature: you can not use EDGE and simultaneously talk on the phone.  If the connection via EDGE is used actively (the webpage is being downloaded, for example), then you will not even hear the incoming call.  If it is passive - the call, apparently, will still come. <br>  Conversation: up to 5 people can take part in the conference. <br>  UI: starting point - contact information.  The easiest way is to first select a person, and only then decide what to do with it - write an SMS or look at its address on the map. <br>  E-mail: iPhone can watch attachments of the following types: .c, .cpp, .diff, .doc, .docx, .h, .hpp, .htm, .html, .m, .mm, .patch, .pdf, .txt, .xls, .xlsx <br>  E-mail UI: approximation (as in Safari) works in the mail - you can increase the part of the letter in order to better consider it. <br>  E-mail: mail from Yahoo comes by itself (PUSH interface).  IPhone can check other mailboxes once every 15 minutes, every half an hour or once an hour. <br>  Safari UI: there is a button Share.  It sends the current page by e-mail. <br>  Safari: can block pop-ups. <br>  iPod: On-The-Go playlists can now be edited - change the order of songs and delete songs from there. <br>  iPod: Video can be deleted from the iPhone on the go. <br>  iPod: buttons below (artists, podcasts, video, etc ...) you can edit: change their order, add others, remove the current ones. <br>  SMS &amp; E-mail: to delete a message, you can click edit, then delete, or you can drag your finger from left to right (as if crossing it out) and click on the Delete button that appears. <br>  Apps: there are Calculator and Notes applications.  Simple as two pennies. <br>  General: iPhone works with VPN over L2TP and PPTP.  And through Wi-Fi and through EDGE. <br>  General: Of course, there is a tray for SIM, but it is mentioned in the context of ‚Äúletting someone play around with the iPhone, but keep your SIM card for yourself‚Äù.  That is, it is impossible to directly use someone else's SIM card.  And even after breaking the contract with AT &amp; T (for the notorious $ 175). <br><br><h2>  News from freshly baked owners: </h2><br><ul><li>  It seems, the Safari is not able to disconnect images.  So far it only seems.  However, they have unlimited data plan there. <br>  People are delighted from the screen.  Mass. <br>  Also, everyone is surprised by the size.  He is smaller than it seemed to everyone.  In a good way. <br>  However, fingerprints on the screen remain. <br>  Very good feedback on sound quality.  People with the same operator but with another phone are delighted. <br>  For reading RSS, <a href="http://reader.mac.com/">reader.mac.com</a> is used - a special AJAX application for the iPhone <br>  EDGE in the States on the iPhone showed a speed of 180kbps. <br>  Apparently (and this is very sad), the interface is still exclusively English.  Keyboard too.  Still not exactly clear, but apparently so. <br>  The keyboard works in landscape mode and it is very fast and convenient. <br>  The stock of screen brightness is very high.  If you set the maximum - beats in the eyes. <br>  Many praise zooming.  It is claimed that it works very smoothly and comfortably. <br><br>  Most reviews are very similar to this: <br><blockquote>  I just got mine, and it is freaking brilliant.  I have ever seen.  Literally. <br></blockquote><br>  People, make products for people.  Remember that geeks like you and me are the smallest part of humanity, and some of them are a little sick.  And people - they are different.  Thank you Apple for the first phone for people. </li></ul></li></ul></li></ul></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/11609/">https://habr.com/ru/post/11609/</a></p>
