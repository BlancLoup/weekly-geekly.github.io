We can assume that the company offers the candidate to conduct a self-test on the requirements, and the candidate will know what he will have to do in the new job.  How to make this stage most useful for both parties? <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Often, employers compile job advertisements in such a way that it is not entirely clear who they are really willing to hire.  The ad includes all the specific technologies and languages ‚Äã‚Äãthat are currently used in the project, and maybe those that I would like to use, and the experience with this zoo must necessarily be from three years.  It turns out a very specific mixture, which, perhaps, describes well the employees already working in the company or even identifies the nonexistent ideal employee, but is completely inappropriate for finding new ones.  Why?  And because there are no such people on the market. 
      <br>
        <script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>
        <ins class="adsbygoogle"
          style="display:block; text-align:center;"
          data-ad-layout="in-article"
          data-ad-format="fluid"
          data-ad-client="ca-pub-6974184241884155"
          data-ad-slot="8945601208"></ins>

      <br>
      A serious candidate, seeing such an announcement, understands that he is not suitable, and with a high probability will not respond to a vacancy so as not to waste his time.  And those who do not value their time will spend the time of the employer on an empty primary interview. <br><br>  Therefore it is necessary to divide the ad into several logical sections.  The first is mandatory requirements.  They need to indicate something without which it is really impossible to do and what cannot be learned in a reasonable time.  It should be understood that the more this section is, the less potential employees will be ready to try their hand.  The employer should also prepare in advance for each item, think up how you will check the candidate's knowledge.  Once these requirements are mandatory, then they need to be checked carefully. <br><br>  In order to make the candidate understand the subject area in which he will have to grow professionally, add the section ‚ÄúIt is desirable to know or the vector of development‚Äù.  Here you can describe all the technologies that you want to use and the subject area in which you work.  Candidates with the right skills will understand that they have an advantage in the interview and will respond more eagerly.  And the rest will be able to evaluate whether they will be interested in work and whether they are ready to grow in these areas. <br><br>  It is also extremely important to have a section describing the responsibilities of the new employee.  You know what he will do, right?  If not, then consider whether you should even look for someone.  Responsibilities of the employee - this is what he will do at work every day.  Write code, go to meetings, communicate with clients, write documentation, read ROI?  All duties should be indicated, even if it seems to you that everything is obvious from the title of the vacancy.  This, on the one hand, will exclude all those who are not interested in the work, and on the other, people do not suddenly know after a month of work that they should maintain the product backlog and compile KPI reports. <br><br>  And of course, it is worth describing all the advantages that you have in the company for such good people who will pass all your tests.  Write about everything honestly.  Payment of sick leave by law?  Are you seriously?  You are not recruiting cashiers in Auchan, it is not interesting for anyone to get half the salary after a week of work from home due to illness.  Understood that this is not an advantage, you can specify in the section "We are a cool company, BUT."  Paid lunches in the office, swimming pool, football, fitness?  Good.  Dms?  If nothing is included in it, except for rendering emergency assistance in critical situations, then it is better not to disgrace, so that there will be no disappointment.  Subscribe to <a href="http://blog.codinghorror.com/the-programmers-bill-of-rights/">The Programmer's Bill of Rights</a> ?  Then it is definitely worth pointing out.  In general, praise the company, but be honest, as there is nothing worse than deceived expectations. <br><br>  Have a good hunting. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/296656/">https://habr.com/ru/post/296656/</a></p>
