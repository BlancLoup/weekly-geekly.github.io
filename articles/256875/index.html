    <h4>  Monitoring network and agent pools </h4><br>  We hurry to brag - servers in Poland, Iran and Russia were recently added.  Thanks to them, our network includes already 50 servers on all inhabited continents.  At the same time, they are divided into pools.  Thus, it is possible to select only those parts of the world that are of interest for a particular site.  Previously, there was a similar function, but it was very limited.  Now it is possible to select several pools at once, if the site‚Äôs audience is more global. <br><br>  However, at the moment there are still some limitations.  So, there should be at least seven checking servers in total.  This means that at the moment it will not be possible to organize an inspection exclusively from South America - you will have to connect at least one more region.  The fact is that the logic of checks provides for the possibility of false positives, and for this purpose a mechanism for rechecking is provided.  Thanks to him, shutting down, software failure, accidentally getting an IP address in the blacklist and other possible circumstances on one or even several servers, do not lead to the generation of false alerts and distortion of statistics. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/56f/4bb/1ed/56f4bb1edf424ae98d82062e4a8fe862.png"><br><br><h4>  What is it done for? </h4><br>  First, such indicators as site response time or download speed become more accurate, which is important for everyone.  Secondly, when choosing a particular pool, the agents become smaller, and each agent checks the site more often.  This is true if you have the majority of clients from one country - checking the site from all over the world, there is a chance that while the servers from the opposite end of the world return a positive result, the site ‚Äúdisappears‚Äù from its native edges. <br>  And thirdly, we have repeatedly encountered a situation where it turned out that the client‚Äôs site does not open from some server being checked, and the restrictions are set at the data center level, and it is very difficult for us to influence them.  Or vice versa.  The reason for this may be, for example, placing the site on a shared hosting, where it can share its IP address with no known reason.  It happens that with the operational reflection of ddos ‚Äã‚Äãattacks, cities or even whole countries fall into the ‚Äúblack‚Äù lists.  And the speed of correcting these misunderstandings directly depends on the number of interested clients: if a server from Brazil never comes from Eastern Europe, then a random IP address from the Russian Federation may hang there for a long time.  Exclusion from checking servers from foreign countries (if it is not included in the target audience of the site) solves such problems. <br>  Nevertheless, the opportunity to choose the whole world also remains - checks will be carried out from the most reliable servers from all continents.  Global monitoring, of course, is also of interest to a large number of sites. <br><br>  If you have any questions or suggestions, we are always happy to hear them. <br></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/256875/">https://habr.com/ru/post/256875/</a></p>
