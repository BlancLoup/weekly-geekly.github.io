If you remember, <a href="http://www.behance.net/gallery/10617821/SALIENCE-Short-Film">Paul Trillo</a> , a promising director from Brooklyn, used 41 shots with a resolution of 41 megapixels, taken on Nokia Lumia 1020, to shoot the video in the style of the infinite zoom. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/LmDNjZM3Tu8%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700023,15700186,15700190,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhh5iJ_XArx4U6fVcNXuBYsLcjvLPA" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  Was it possible to do something cooler than this?

      Details about how the ‚ÄúLiving Moments‚Äù video was created - under the cut. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  After the trilogy "The Matrix" is difficult for someone to hit the effect of "bullet flight".  However, Paul Trillo seems to have found his approach.  Instead of using the <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3DT9h_OMFB0OM">classic</a> effect, he used the arc-shaped trajectory of frame-by-frame shooting, where the first and last frame of each episode was filmed near the ground.  As a result, during the installation, an interesting effect of the revolution of the world appeared. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/704/c2f/bf8/704c2fbf82e80c446d6127207a9bdc68.jpg"><br><br>  Especially for this, we built a special mobile construction in the form of an arch, on which 50 Nokia Lumia 1020 smartphones were fixed on a continuous arc.  A total of about 30,000 images were shot in Manhattan, including Union Square, Allen Street and Central Park West. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/hHVkNcvxMZM%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700023,15700186,15700190,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhhlEDvBxqUQZarSnXkou25_ZNRSDw" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  It is noteworthy that the control over the shooting was carried out using a Microsoft Surface tablet and a Windows 8 application specially written to create this video. <br><br>  We were able to ask Paul Trillo a few questions about creating the ‚ÄúLiving Moments‚Äù commercial: <br><br>  <b>This is a really dizzying video, Paul.</b>  <b>How did you get the idea for this video?</b> <br><br>  I have long wanted to experiment with the effect of "frozen time."  So when the creative division of Nokia Brand Labs offered me to work on a new project and gave me about fifty Lumia 1020 smartphones, I thought that this was a great opportunity to implement my ideas. <br><br>  I have already been fed up with these numerous commercials with the effects of ‚Äúbullet flight‚Äù, shot somewhere in the studios.  I wanted to go out and try to make something real.  I thought that it would be interesting to make the camera work outside the box, I would even say surreal.  At the same time, I wanted to preserve the static character of the frame and the plot, as in a reportage photo.  That is why I decided that this project will be 100% mobile. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/2f3/347/ff6/2f3347ff63ab808f3ca3157fdb7865ad.jpg"><br><br>  One of the main tasks in the implementation of this idea was to create a smooth transition between the "scenes" while maintaining the effect of "bullet flight" throughout the video.  We discussed how to connect telephones in such a way as to create this loop-like effect around an object in the center.  But this idea was not particularly fresh and innovative.  For a long time, I was still thinking about something else: I wanted to make the camera move so that it would go underground, and then reappear on the surface.  So I had to combine these two ideas and turn over (traditionally standing horizontally) the mount by 90 ¬∞, securing the Lumia smartphones on the main plane. <br><br>  <b>Speaking of smartphones, as you mentioned above, it took 50 pieces of Lumia 1020 to shoot this video. What features of these devices did you find most useful for shooting?</b> <br><br>  Firstly, I can say with confidence that this design and this concept could only be born using cameras the size of mobile devices.  To take 50 pieces of any other cameras will be very expensive and confused. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/ef2/164/8f8/ef21648f8c33b35d4067d0c497e59972.jpg"><br><br>  And if we used professional cameras with lenses, then such an amount simply would not physically fit on structures of this type and size.  The devices had to be flat and compact.  Approaching by these parameters, Lumia 1020 has the best camera on the smartphone market, so its use really made sense. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/780/cbc/6ad/780cbc6ad4c1f15e273282d3038d8425.jpg"><br><br>  Model 1020 is famous for its 41 megapixel camera with a matrix, but the smartphone also has other useful features that we used.  Nonetheless, it was high-resolution images that allowed us to achieve such a ‚Äúsmooth‚Äù and smooth image during video processing.  We also could not do without another important feature of the Lumia 1020 - full manual settings of shooting parameters (ISO, white balance, shutter speed, etc.).  The app we created for the Surface tablet gave us full control over these settings. <br><br>  <b>Which scene from the video do you like the most and why?</b> <br><br>  There are really great moments.  For example, we managed to capture truly successful shots like a man with pigeons or a skater jumping.  But personally, what I like most is more relaxed, more ‚Äúpersonal‚Äù shots.  This is what you do not expect to see in the video with the effect of "bullet time".  For me, this is an attempt to stop the moment from the life of a single person, and not to achieve something ‚Äúunusual‚Äù or ‚Äústunning‚Äù.  One of the moments that stands out most is the scene with a man sitting with a naked torso on a bench next to two fashionably dressed residents of New York.  They were discussing some kind of exhibition, while this man just sat next to her and sunbathed.  People on both sides of this bench belong to two completely different worlds, but at the same time they are sitting very close to each other, which is so characteristic of New York.  This shirtless man told me the secret of how to look good in his 75: he just never raised his voice over the past 50 years. <br><br>  Now you have two unusual short clips created on the Lumia 1020, NY41x41 and Living Moments.  Has Lumia 1020 changed your perception of how films are made?  Has the opportunity for experimentation expanded? <br><br>  Now it seems to me that the 41 √ó 41 movie was a kind of probing for what could be done, and we brought our work to a new level thanks to the second video.  Lumia 1020 is equipped with a high-quality camera, and, I believe, other manufacturers have not yet been able to achieve this level.  Nokia developed the device, focusing on the opinion of photographers and videographers.  The smartphone allows you to move faster and place it in places where a regular camera would never fit.  Placing 50 devices on the street was only possible with a Lumia 1020 size camera. <br><br>  According to Paul, a new era of mobile video has arrived for indie cinema, where expensive cameras and cameras are not required to create an interesting and unusual video.  What do you think about this? <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/bb0/6d1/e60/bb06d1e604760155afb5a6dba8549660.jpg"></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/224757/">https://habr.com/ru/post/224757/</a></p>
