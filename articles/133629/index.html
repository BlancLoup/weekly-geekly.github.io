Having changed my operator from Megafon to Tele2 a couple of years ago, I left the Megafon SIM and periodically threw 100-300 rubles at it, with the configured call forwarding to Tele2.  Unfortunately, Tele2 does not work outside of St. Petersburg and the region, so I decided to use a megaphone number, threw money on it to a balance of about 500 rubles, and drove off. <br>  A day later, somewhere in the territory of Belarus, I receive SMS from Megaphone: <br>  ‚ÄúRoaming service is temporarily suspended.  Roaming will connect automatically with a balance of more than 1500 rubles.  References * 101 # ¬ª.  Well, actually, everything!  There is no connection at all, the proposed <i>* 101 #</i> , of course, does not dial. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  Several ... um ... surprised by such a development of events, having arrived home, first of all I go to the office of the operator.  They show me the terms of the provision of roaming, and specifically <a href="http://spb.megafon.ru/popups/ulovi_predostavleniya_uslugi_roum.html">items 6 and 7</a> .  Here they are: <br><blockquote>  6. Due to the presence of technical features in the provision of the Roaming service, as well as the features associated with inter-operator payments for the Roaming service, the Operator reserves the right to partially restrict or completely suspend the provision of the Roaming service. <br>  7. In order to use the Roaming service, the Operator recommends maintaining the Subscriber‚Äôs personal account balance at a level of at least 1500 rubles. </blockquote>

      To my question, do they see the difference between ‚Äúrecommends‚Äù and ‚Äúmust‚Äù the answer, of course not.  Well, I am making a claim against them ( <i>unfortunately, I did not keep the text of the claim</i> ). <br><br>  After almost two months, the phone rang from Megaphone.  Pretty girl justifies the shutdown ... the actions of the security service.  They say that according to the terms of the provision of roaming, they have the right to do so, and although ‚Äúan error has occurred‚Äù, it does not agree with the depravity of such an idea.  Well, I expect a written response from them. <br>  And here he comes, <b>Answer</b> : <br><br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/436/4ff/9e4/4364ff9e4233b318bd9924a2c56d1b5e.jpg"></a> <br><br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/b04/6d9/274/b046d92741d2377b9dee32b94022925b.jpg"></a> <br><br>  It turns out that spending 144 rubles per day in roaming (with an initial balance of about 500 rubles) is enough, from MegaFon's point of view, to turn off the connection.  And not just like that, but ‚Äúin order to respect your interests in order to prevent the occurrence of debts in the account‚Äù.  Here they are, these suspicious spending: <br><br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/263/35c/e2c/26335ce2c1c55b50a3716b4e6e6c0b49.jpg"></a> <br><br>  Even more surprised by this approach, I write a <a href="http://78.rsoc.ru/social/p7389/">claim to RosKomNadzor</a> with a request to check for compliance with the laws of this practice. <br><br>  And here comes the answer: <br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/914/dbb/d40/914dbbd4077f86c29339678798326d92.jpg"></a> <br><br>  In short, Megafon, by its actions, violated one clause of federal law, one sub-clause and one clause of the license terms, as well as five clauses of the rules from the government resolution.  For which an administrative violation case was initiated under Article 14.1 of the Administrative Code ( <a href="http://www.consultant.ru/popular/koap/13_15.html">Entrepreneurial activity without state registration or without special permission (license)</a> ), part three: <br><blockquote>  3. Carrying out business activities in violation of the conditions provided for by a special permit (license) - shall entail a warning or the imposition of an administrative fine on citizens in the amount of one thousand five hundred to two thousand rubles;  on officials - from three thousand to four thousand rubles;  <b>on legal entities - from thirty thousand to forty thousand rubles</b> . <br></blockquote><br><br>  In addition, an order was issued to eliminate the violations found. <br><br>  So Megaphone habitually stepped on a rake with roaming.  Only now received not by the forehead, but by the back of the head.  :) <br>  To be fair, it should be noted: the calls from MegaFon representatives were polite, and the minus was removed from the account, as well as they were given a bonus of 50 points (which, however, I still did not activate). </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/133629/">https://habr.com/ru/post/133629/</a></p>
