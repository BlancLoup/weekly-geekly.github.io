  <section class="page js-page"><h1>ASO: ranking in the App Store and Google Play (find 10 differences in algorithms)</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  I‚Äôll just say that no one will give you an exact answer to most of the questions discussed below (unless your friend does not work at Apple / Google and is not going to break the NDA), and the current actual version of the answer can only be obtained by tests, preferably on a sufficiently large traffic.  And you never know for sure how long the current correct version of these answers will last. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Therefore, the conclusions made below do not claim to be the ultimate truth, but are the product of analytics and numerous experiments on real traffic, plus the advice and opinions of members of the <i>#asostack</i> community <br><br>  In both sites, quite a number of factors affect the <i>ranking</i> (not to be confused with <i>indexation</i> ) by a search query (and many virtual dishware were disputed in disputes about their relative weight, so I will only describe the conclusions, the current relevance of which is beyond doubt by most experts).  So, the ranking is strongly influenced by: <br><br><ol><li>  weighing result by matched keywords, </li><li>  the total number of downloads of the application, </li><li>  the number and intensity of downloads from this particular search query, </li><li>  Quality indicators, the list of which is different for Google Play (GP) and the App Store (appstor). </li></ol><br>  Today we will talk about the first paragraph, slightly touching on the fourth.

Google acts completely differently, but Do not forget about the ‚Äúcross the line‚Äù probability, because no one has canceled spam recognition algorithms. At the current moment, according to our observations, the optimal key frequency for all indexable GP blocks is 4-5) <br><br>  <b>Insight 3</b> : Both storages include the number of application launches (usage frequency), the number of reviews, the average rating score of an application (in iOs 11 it will be much easier to manage this factor, just cheating some kind of comparison with GP), the number of deletions of an application ( only GP), time since the last update of the application (only in apstor), the number of external links and references / reviews on the web (GP only), key frequency in reviews (GP only) and RRF (Total developer score, definitely there is in GP, ‚Äã‚Äãnot I dare to argue about  App Store and I will be glad if someone will share their research on this subject).  About the last factor (SBR on Google Play) I will write a separate article when I find the time for it. <br><br>  <b>Insight 4</b> : in the App Store for appearing in search results on the ‚ÄúX Y‚Äù request, it is necessary that ‚ÄúX‚Äù and ‚ÄúY‚Äù are present in any of the blocks (different) that participate in indexing (AppName / Subtitle / Keywords / Developer) in the main locales, either so that "X Y" is present unchanged in (any) of the additional locales, or so that "X" and "Y" are present in the names of the additional locales.  In fact, it was necessary to write ‚Äúit is necessary and sufficient‚Äù, only the position in the issue can be very different, and it depends on the results of the ranking.  The key weight in the primary and secondary locales does not change. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/a93/abb/bf9/a93abbbf948b42178e6cd4f35ae5ed31.png"><br><br>  <b>Bonus is not about ranking</b> : the App Store understands plural numbers (and sometimes cases / times) in English, in all other languages ‚Äã‚Äãthe same keyword in different numbers = different keywords (in iOs 11, so far everything has remained the same, despite assurances Apple from the screenshot above) <br><br>  I would be glad if in the comments you share your observations on the data and related issues. <br><br>  All unlimited organic;) </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/338086/">https://habr.com/ru/post/338086/</a></p>
