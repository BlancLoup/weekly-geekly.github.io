The slogan is of course fun, but any enterprise in our ‚Äúunstable‚Äù time will certainly think about saving.  The item of expenses without which no large or small manufacturing enterprise can exist is electricity.  Agree, the buildings will be on balance, the staff will go to work (until the android robots replace their hard everyday work), but if there is no electricity, then there is no production. <br><br>  As you understand, now we will talk about how large consumers of electricity, namely enterprises, buy this very electricity in large volumes at the lowest cost.  Of course, the state took care of us and developed as many as 6 price categories (abbreviated "Central Committee", but not the party), as they say, "to taste and color."  Let us dwell on this briefly, and then we will talk more about saving. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  <b>A little theory does not hurt.</b>

      Electricity consumers are forced to purchase it from guaranteed suppliers.  For example, in Moscow it is OJSC Mosenergosbyt, in the Novosibirsk region it is OJSC Novosibirskenergosbyt, in the Stavropol Territory it is OJSC Budennovskenergosbyt. <br><br>  <b>The first price category</b> - the price for 1 kW / h does not change (one-rate). <br><br>  <b>The second price category</b> is ‚Äúset yourself a meter‚Äù, which divides the payment according to the zones of the day (day or night).  It is already possible to obtain savings from such consumption if you turn on electrical appliances with the highest consumption at night. <br><br>  It is worth considering that the electricity consumption for 1 and 2 of the Central Committee should not exceed 670 kW / h at any hour.  So you can connect 670 electric kettles that consume 1 kW / h each, but 671 is no longer possible.  It's sad of course, but oh well, let's go further to understand. <br><br>  Large consumers of electricity (&gt; 670 kW) are forced to choose between 3-6 CC.  When calculating the payment for electricity for 3-6 CC, 2 values ‚Äã‚Äãare used - the volume of electricity and the amount of power (two-part calculation).  The amount of electricity is determined by the metering device, power - the value calculated. <br><br>  <b>The third price category</b> - the price of electricity is determined individually for each enterprise, at each hour of the month, and for power (1 MW), the price is one for the entire month.  And the lower the consumption per peak hour, the less the amount of paid power! <br><br>  <b>The fourth price category</b> - the cost of buying electricity is the same as for 3 CC, and the transmission service is defined in two-part terms - for electricity and power separately. <br><br>  <b>The fifth and sixth price categories</b> are for those consumers who can plan electricity consumption by the hour ahead.  According to the method of calculation, 3 and 4 CCPs are similar, though for C 5 and 6 there is a condition - the planned volume is purchased cheaper, and deviations from the plan are more expensive. <br><br>  <b>Hypothesis.</b> <br><br>  If for 3-6 CC, the cost of electricity is determined individually for each hour of the month, then it is necessary to determine the most advantageous hours of consumption and try to take into account the maximum power consumption during these hours. <br><br>  And if you also know the peak consumption hours of your energy sales company in your own region, then the company can get the cheapest cost of electricity. Therefore, for consumers 3-6 of the Central Committee, you need to create a single service to determine profitable electricity consumption hours and peak hours, up to heaps also provide them with information on tariffs, to energy retail companies. <br><br>  <b>Decision</b> <br><br>  The scheme of the solution and creation of such a service is not much different from the traditional for all "start-up" projects in the IT sphere in Russia, and not only.  Developed the concept of project services, attracted "investments" (from own pocket), found a designer and programmers for development. <br><br>  Based on the received input data received: <br><br>  Service " <b>Rating profitable hours</b> " <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/bca/05b/e91/bca05be91ffd4f8a954590943dd07fe0.png"><br><br>  Any consumer can, with an accuracy of 99.9%, determine the profitable hours of electricity consumption of his energy sales company. <br><br>  Service " <b>Peak consumption</b> " <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/89d/2ae/4f6/89d2ae4f606446a48260602ce7396643.png"><br>  Now it is possible to determine the peak hour for a specific day!  The lower the consumption per hour of peak load, the lower the amount of paid power.  For the period specified by the visitor, the frequency of the peak load is published in percentage terms. <br><br>  Service " <b>Calculation of the economy of consumption</b> " <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/fae/09c/36e/fae09c36e43141348145b83591f32a4f.png"><br>  This service is a comparison of economic efficiency for different graphs of electricity consumption.  As a result, we obtain the lowest cost of electrical energy by choosing the optimal hourly schedule for its consumption. <br><br>  Service " <b>Calculation of retail prices</b> " <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/750/3cf/c54/7503cfc5423f4f18828d0f082d65db2d.png"><br>  The service offers the visitor the opportunity to verify the calculation of the retail price produced by the supplier for the corresponding price category.  In the absence of any of the components in the database, you can set it yourself in the calculation results or send a request for its introduction. <br>  In addition to the main services, they created the ability to view the entire base of tariffs and information about all energy sales companies in Russia. <br><br>  <b>Findings:</b> <br><br>  It would seem that the service was created exclusively for large consumers of electricity.  However, if the cost of electricity rises (and it will be so), then in the end, we will have to pay with you and my friends - comrades.  Capitalists for us have introduced the term - end users.  This means that the benefits of the service are directed not only to large enterprises, but also to end users. <br></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/362061/">https://habr.com/ru/post/362061/</a></p>
