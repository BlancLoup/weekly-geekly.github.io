  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Types of communication for business: which one to choose?</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  A modern company, no matter how large it is, is simply impossible to imagine without a telephone.  However, there are quite a few varieties of telephone connections today.  What kind of communication is more profitable? <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  <u>IP telephony</u> <br><br>  Recently this type of communication is gaining momentum.  What is its essence?  In simple terms, this is an opportunity to make calls worldwide via the Internet.  To do this, of course, you need to connect a special service provider. <br><br>  Among the advantages of IP-telephony is the possibility of multi-channel connection, as well as the network nature of the connection.  In the first case, you can set the number of interlocutors, in the second - use free calls between offices in different buildings.  In addition, tariffs for IP-telephony is indeed lower than that of a regular telephone connection.  This is especially felt when communicating with foreign employees and partners.

      Among the downsides of this type of connection is the need for a stable Internet connection and a speed of 512 Kbps.  For large cities, this is not a problem, but not every provincial Russian city (not to mention the countryside) can boast a stable signal and high speeds. <br><br>  <u>Analog connection</u> <br><br>  The traditional form of telephone service, available almost everywhere and familiar to the majority of the Russian population.  Communication is carried out using an analog signal, which is transmitted via the line drawn for this. <br><br>  The advantages of traditional analog communication are clear: availability, wide range of distribution, as well as the low cost of the necessary equipment. <br><br>  But there are significant drawbacks.  The first is tariffs, which are still high compared to IP-telephony rates.  The second is the additional costs of equipment and line when connecting one more (two, three) numbers. <br><br>  <u>Which number to choose?</u> <br><br>  This question is perhaps no less important than the choice of the type of communication for a business.  The phone number affects the first impression created by the company.  Judge for yourself - which organization is more credible: with a number starting with Moscow code (495-499) or a cell phone from which region is not clear? <br><br>  Recently, the federal numbers for 8,800 have become popular. Yes, such a number is usually really easily remembered.  To call him is quite simple - almost everyone today has a mobile phone.  And the call throughout the country is free.  All these are advantages for the client (buyer / consumer).  And what's for the business owner?  The real profit number 8 800 can bring in the case of the call-center - where there really is a need for very frequent calls.  In other cases, the number 8,800 simply does not pay off, although it adds solidity.  However, even with such a ‚Äúbeautiful‚Äù number you can save.  For example, choose an analogue - number for 8 804. <br><br>  A regular (or not quite ordinary) federal number of a cellular operator may not be the best choice for business development.  This number does not inspire confidence, does not add solidity and weight of the company.  Even in the case of a ‚Äúbeautiful‚Äù combination of numbers - the federal number is associated with private business or personal use, but not with a serious company. <br><br>  City number - the most familiar and one of the most comfortable.  Even in our time, when the landline telephone is no longer so popular, the city number adds weight and respectability to the company.  A city number for a client is the presence of an office with employees at the company (although in fact it may not be there), and therefore there are guarantees.  This number will look more attractive on business cards - which is also a definite plus. <br><br>  CloverTel (http://www.nomer-495.ru/) offers multi-channel virtual numbers that are not tied to a specific place (office).  In addition, on the CloverTel number it is easy and quick to increase the number of incoming lines in case the business starts to actively develop.  In addition, it is also advantageous tariffs in Russia and the countries of the Near Abroad.  Well and, of course, the opportunity to choose a beautiful room starting with 495 and 499. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/299530/">https://habr.com/ru/post/299530/</a></p>
