  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Thoughts about 2.0 + bonus (continuation of countries, regions, cities)</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Hello everyone, habrareyudi.  About 4 years ago I was making a ‚Äúnew‚Äù NoNaMe, the very same nnm.ru, which gives fry for 7 years and more.  At that time, there were no 2.0 concepts, but we really did a 2.0 project, based on what was + groups from Yahoo + a bunch of ideas, we implemented the 2.0 idea before others described it.  But at that time we did not know that it would eventually be called web 2.0, that the users themselves generate such content and so on.  The current NNM is not much like modern 2.0 solutions, however, whether you like it or not, it really was a pioneer.  Today I would like to talk not about a specific project, but about 2.0 as a whole.  It has been a long time since people from the empty words ‚Äúweb 2.0‚Äù have come to clearly understand what it is and who it is.  2.0 is often bolted to words like ajax, rss, usability, social and so on.  In fact, there is no clear definition of 2.0, but for me personally this is the next step towards independence.  Those.  There are some technologies that we use (at first it was html, then css and js appeared, then flash, xml, ajax, etc.), but there is an approach to building services / projects / sites, call it what you want.  About 10 years ago I couldn‚Äôt imagine that you could make your own service like mail.ru, and now?  Now every second can create a similar.  2.0 solutions are, for me personally, a bunch of modern technologies and modern trends, fashion, so to speak.  Namely - social, content generation by users and so forth.  It is necessary to distinguish between technology and concept. <br>  2.0 solutions in the form of concepts have a number of their pros and cons, like any on our planet.  In particular, I would like to draw a parallel with ... radio ... <br>  Modern radio does not appear without a ‚Äúprogram by request‚Äù, where music is placed by calling, without SMS voting and other modern services.  But there is an exception ... <br>  Namely - KEKS FM.  Residents of the city-hemorrhoids of Moscow navernik noticed numerous advertising of this radio station in the subway, on billboards and other advertising sites of the city.  One day, when I bought a billboard, I set up the model in my car at 89.9, expecting to hear another banal radio station and switch to another one with a calm soul and calm down.  It was not there.  Not only that they practically do not twist anything except music and news, they also do not receive calls or SMS with orders.  Their motto: ‚ÄúKeksf.ft, play what we want!‚Äù.  Brilliant and paradoxical.  As a radio, being a prime example 1.0 can be born in the time of 2.0 making radio stations and is proud of it!  Moreover, now I listen to him constantly.  And I'm not alone!  A vivid example of the fact that with a good fall, even old, forgotten decisions can give 10 points of handicap to the most modern solutions.  I do not argue, the cupcake had a good advertisement. </div>
