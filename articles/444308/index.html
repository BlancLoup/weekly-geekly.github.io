  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Gaming industry news (March 11-18, 2019)</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"><p>  Extremely self-confident selection of gaming news over the past week.  <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/443274/">Last time, a</a> couple of people said that they would read, so I continue.  First <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3DXZtV3HkiSdk">written on video</a> , then decrypted with text. </p><br><h1 id="novyy-shuter-ot-wargaming-s-aaa-byudzhetami">  New Wargaming shooter with AAA budgets </h1><br><p>  Wargaming together with the Ukrainian studio Frag Lab (125 people) <a href="https://wccftech.com/wargaming-frag-lab-next-gen-f2p-mmo/">will make a</a> new free to play AAA shooter on Amazon technologies.  Studio developers worked on Crysis, Battlefield and Warface - all games are pretty decent.  Confused here is only the presence of Amazon. </p><br><p>  This is what Brian Taptich (Vice President at Amazon Game Tech) said: </p><a name="habracut"></a><br><blockquote>  We are excited to work with each other.  Wargaming and Fragment Labs are a low-latency multiplayer game. </blockquote><p>  Personally, I am not very calm that the developers are increasingly sitting on the igloo of cloud platforms.  After all, it can be that the game servers will become fundamentally non-portable on standalone machines.  Spread everything with enough lambda and everything has arrived.  Maybe this <em>is obsessed with a</em> perfect special meaning. </p><br><p>  Wargaming also plans to make a diablo-like Pagan Online (35 hours of content, without microtransactions).  Ironically, as Blizzard withdrew from this glade, it can now shoot. </p><br><h1 id="novyy-vitok-cenzury-super-real-mahjong-pv-vybrosili-iz-nintendo-eshop">  New round of censorship: Super Real Mahjong PV thrown out of Nintendo eShop </h1><br><p>  Super Real Mahjong PV discarded from Nintendo eShop.  SRMPV is the port of the game, <a href="https://video-games.fandom.com/wiki/Super_Real_Mahjong_P_V">released during the reign of Tsar Pea</a> , May 25, 1995.  Again, all the same nonsense - the developers cover up the naked parts of the body, cover up not radically enough (relative to the attitude of the radical SJW-Schnick) and kick them out of the store.  Examples of "insufficient blurring" can be viewed <a href="https://twitter.com/MOKOTURN/status/1105858910437568512">on Twitter</a> . </p><br><h1 id="intervyu-s-glavoy-daedalic-entertainment">  Interview with Daedalic Entertainment CEO </h1><br><p>  <a href="https://dtf.ru/gameindustry/43068-rossiya-nash-vtoroy-rynok-intervyu-s-glavoy-daedalic-entertainment">Good article, long interview</a> from Daedalic Days 2019 conference in Hamburg.  Link to DTF because it is suddenly - the source.  Interestingly, Daedalic considers Russia to be one of its main target audiences, although it has switched from quests to other games (Blackguards, Shadow Tactics: Blades of the Shogun, Long Journey Home, Skyhill, Bounty Train, etc).  The memory of how we once consumed trash quests, probably will remain in our hearts forever. </p><br><p><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/mi/rq/ve/mirqve28tqf3nlywtlbshaugq4u.png"></p><br><h1 id="division-2-prinyali-holodno-a-vot-deneg-pridyotsya-otdavat---zharko">  Division 2 took the cold, but the money will have to give - hot! </h1><br><p>  The game started <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/articles/2019-03-18-uk-charts-slow-start-for-the-division-2">80% worse than</a> Division 1, although it took the first line of the chart in 3 days. </p><br><p>  Networks like M.Video have <a href="https://twitter.com/mgame_official/status/1088034411969421314/photo/1">warned</a> that the recommended price for Division 2 will rise to 4490 for the standard edition, and to 4990 for the Washington edition.  And it really increased, on the night of the 14th to the 15th. </p><br><p>  But the digital version also went up - from 3999 rubles to 4499 (base), Ultimate Edition - from 6699 rubles to 7899 rubles.  In the Microsoft Store, at this moment, again, something bagonulo, and the cost jumped above 100 bucks (now, it seems, has already been repaired). </p><br><p>  These new prices are ubiquitous, for example Sony's Days Gone also costs 4499 rubles.  Personally, to me, as an avid baker and a turkey hen, it is completely incomprehensible who is ready to calmly look at such prices. </p><br><h1 id="ea-access-poyavitsya-v-playstation-store">  EA Access will appear in the PlayStation Store </h1><br><p>  The redditor has <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/PS4/comments/b27zoi/image_possible_ea_acess_leak_on_the_brazillian_psn/%3Futm_medium%3Dandroid_app%26utm_source%3Dshare">posted a</a> screen shot of the Brazilian PSN where EA Access is clearly visible.  This is a paid subscription service, where access costs 299 rubles per month or 1799 rubles per year, plus there are 10% discount promotions. </p><br><p><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/nu/mk/2r/numk2rir8w3n3qta-ey1c3p2urq.jpeg"></p><br><h1 id="lucasfilm-vozvraschaetsya-v-videogeyming">  LucasFilm returns to video gaming </h1><br><p>  Lucasfilm Games <a href="https://jobs.disneycareers.com/search-jobs%3Fk%3DGaming%26alp%3D6252001%26alt%3D2">vacancies appeared</a> on the Disney website.  Let me remind you, the gaming unit of LucasArts Entertainment disappeared in 2013. </p><br><p><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/hg/b6/kl/hgb6klc7g9iatcfqtjpudteqcge.jpeg"></p><br><h1 id="teper-na-twitch-vy-obyazany-smotret-reklamu">  Now on Twitch you are required to watch ads. </h1><br><p>  Advertising blockers no longer work, as <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Twitch/comments/b1xdgf/rip_ublock_origin_its_a_much_deeper_problem_than/">noted by the redditers</a> .  This technology - the inclusion of advertising directly in the video stream - was announced <a href="https://blog.twitch.tv/introducing-surestream-for-a-better-video-ad-experience-on-twitch-3ca5ce3287c">back in 2016</a> , but really earned only now. </p><br><p>  To my taste, Twitch now has a lot more problems - yes, their wonderful moderation policy.  At the wrong time they decided to raise the degree of hell.  Personally, I slid <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/javawatchnews">off the tweet</a> back to <a href="http://youtube.com/c/javawatch">YouTube</a> and <a href="https://mixer.com/olegchir">Mixer</a> , where there is no such debauchery yet.  In general, it's funny to look at this struggle of giants: Twitch is Amazon, YouTube is Google and Alphabet, Mixer is Microsoft.  Only IBM-Redhat and Oracle are missing to the full deck. </p><br><p>  By the way, Twitch has a paid Twitch Turbo option, but they do not promise that after the purchase advertising will disappear always and everywhere. </p><br><h1 id="epicdatainfo---analog-steamspy-dlya-epic-store">  epicdata.info - SteamSpy analog for Epic Store </h1><br><p>  Szymon Lisowiec, a developer from Poland, launched <a href="https://epicdata.info/">EpicData</a> , an analogue of SteamSpy.  He still does not reach the full analogue, but the light at the end of the tunnel is visible, since in principle, the Epic Store gives all the necessary data. </p><br><h1 id="pokupayte-igry-v-snapchat">  Buy games in Snapchat </h1><br><p>  On April 4, in Los Angeles there will be a presentation at the first Snapchat summit.  The games they have will develop studio Prettygreat, bought for 8.6 million dollars - it employs the developers Fruit Ninja and Jetpack Joyride. </p><br><p>  The bottom line is that third-party applications <a href="https://cheddar.com/media/snapchat-to-launch-gaming-platform">will be integrated</a> with this new Project Cognac platform, that is, they will work on top of the Snapchata network. </p><br><p>  Attention, ahtung: <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-snap-tencent-holdings-videogames/tencent-sees-video-games-more-ads-in-snapchats-future-idUSKBN1D90A2%3FfeedType%3DRSS%26feedName%3DtechnologyNews">Tencent owns</a> 12% of the shares, and this is never fun. </p><br><h1 id="qiwi-zapustila-sorevnovatelnuyu-kibersportivnuyu-ligu">  QIWI launched a competitive e-sports league </h1><br><p>  They play CS: GO and Dota 2, single and team competitions, rewarding every 2 weeks.  Called the <a href="https://teamplay.qiwi.com/">Teamplay League</a> .  Where did such a dry corporate name come from - history is silent.  It runs on top of a proprietary platform called <a href="https://www.faceit.com/ru">FACEIT</a> . </p><br><p>  Previously, Qiwi has already <a href="https://qiwi.com/lenta/news/item.action%3Fid%3D7888">supported the Double Dimension team</a> in 2017 for qualifying games in The Kiev Major, spending more than 50 thousand dollars. </p><br><h1 id="epic-games-store-skaniruet-slishkom-mnogo">  Epic Games Store scans too much </h1><br><p>  Previously, players noticed that the Epic Games Store client for some reason scans the Steam directory.  There is a <a href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/epic-promises-to-fix-game-launcher-after-privacy-concerns/">great article on this</a> . </p><br><p>  In short, Sweeney (head of Epic) <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/pcgaming/comments/b15k8g/epic_games_launcher_appears_to_collect_your_steam/eik61y2/%3Fcontext%3D1">said</a> that it was his cant, only one file needed to be scanned - localconfig.vdf.  They just did not have time to code it normally, because they were in a hurry to release and drove the programmers as best they could.  Also, Epic officially <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/PhoenixPoint/comments/b0rxdq/epic_game_store_spyware_tracking_and_you/eijlbge/">replied to the reddititors</a> that they are not <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/PhoenixPoint/comments/b0rxdq/epic_game_store_spyware_tracking_and_you/eijlbge/">uploading</a> everything to the server, but only hashes from the database of friends, and only if you agreed to import friends.  The sources of the system that sends the data <a href="https://github.com/EpicGames/UnrealEngine/tree/release/Engine/Plugins/Messaging">are on GitHub</a> , and in general the data is transmitted only about the hardware used, page statistics and the Unreal Editor, as described <a href="https://www.epicgames.com/site/en-US/privacypolicy">in their policy</a> and laid out <a href="">on the github</a> . </p><br><h1 id="novye-vozmozhnosti-cryengine">  New CryEngine Features </h1><br><p>  There is a video with the new features of Total Illumination.  Lighting uses SVOGI - simplified ray tracing, which was invented back in 2015.  DX12 and Vulkan are supported.  Acceleration of new Nvidia video cards through RT kernels is not announced. </p><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/1nqhkDm2_Tw" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><h1 id="kanobu-kupil-igromaniyu">  "Kanobu" bought "Igromania" </h1><br><p>  The owner of "Kanobu" - Haji Makhtiev.  On February 1, he <a href="https://www.facebook.com/mGadji/posts/10213521267246807">announced</a> that he had become the operating director of Igromania.  And on March 13, Makhtiyev became the main owner of TM-Media LLC, which controls Igromania.  Projects will unite, Anton Suchkov (known as the Director of Digital Strategy and Communications at Rambler) will be the driver, the goal is to double the audience of projects.  For me, this is very good news - for a two-fold increase, a company must do something more global than just milking oldfags.  And there are separate bells - for example, the opportunity to <a href="https://kanobu.ru/news/pochemu-myidobavili-nakanobu-vozmozhnost-podderzhat-avtorov-rublem-410579/">reward the author</a> to Kanoba <a href="https://kanobu.ru/news/pochemu-myidobavili-nakanobu-vozmozhnost-podderzhat-avtorov-rublem-410579/">with a ruble</a> .  Makhtiyev's slogan "1. loot 2. traffic 3. image" 2017 production very nicely falls on my understanding of "marketing and vanity," which means in the future that all this emerging movement will not stall. </p><br><p>  Unfortunately, posts on Facebook are not available to everyone, so you can read <a href="https://dtf.ru/gameindustry/43057-vladelec-kanobu-kupil-igromaniyu-chto-dalshe">something on this topic on DTF</a> , there it is customary to cache such posts. </p><br><p><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/q4/ku/t4/q4kut4y2b7mvmvax2adfbm9i3qm.jpeg"></p><br><h1 id="poklonniki-terrorista-geroya-v-steam">  Fans of the ‚Äúhero‚Äù terrorist on Steam </h1><br><p>  The story about the New Zealand terrorist was not only heard by the lazy one, and the gaming news is not a place for political parties.  However, sometimes it still leaks out.  More than a hundred fans began to put a name for themselves and the avatars of a terrorist, and the Steam moderators dropped to manual censorship - mowed down all these mentions.  In various magazines and blogs they point out that there are a lot of references to terrorism on Steam, but I didn‚Äôt search and search in this cesspool, especially those who want it will find everything. </p><br><h1 id="discord-prevratili-odin-bolshoy-magazin-v-malenkie-chastnye-lavochki">  Discord turned one large store into small private shops </h1><br><p>  The panel will no longer have a store launched in October 2018.  Instead, the developers for a little money will be able to confirm their servers as "official", and connect their mini-store to them.  Also, developers will receive advanced statistics.  You can read <a href="https://blog.discordapp.com/empowering-developers-with-community-and-commerce-68d9c0712662">on the official Medium</a> . </p><br><p><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/a8e/732/6c3/a8e7326c36b0fcf5295b160cc0aff000.png"></p><br><p><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/8f3/026/162/8f3026162d1b2266ff161dc38c56c94b.png"></p><br><h1 id="v-rossii-prodazhi-retro-konsoley-v-2018-godu-vyrosli-na-45">  In Russia, sales of retro consoles in 2018 increased by 45% </h1><br><p>  About it <a href="https://www.kommersant.ru/doc/3910112">writes "Kommersant"</a> . </p><br><p>  The market volume is 640 thousand copies (a growth of 26%).  In absolute numbers - 12.5 billion rubles (an increase of 30%). </p><br><p>  The largest increase - 45% in the segment of retro consoles.  About 100 thousand systems of PlayStation Classic, Nintendo Classic Mini and SNES Mini. </p><br><p>  The leader is still the PlayStation 4 - 60% of console sales, followed by the Xbox One, and a Nintendo Switch in the tail. </p><br><h1 id="ea-ne-zastavlyali-bioware-delat-anthem">  EA didn't force BioWare to do Anthem </h1><br><p>  Jason Schraer <a href="https://twitter.com/jasonschreier/status/1106201343746813952">recently otbog on Twitter</a> , sharing another insight about the fact that EA studios have a lot of autonomy, and no one forced BioWare to do exactly Anthem.  Considering other insights that the studio just threw everything and began to do Anthem, it sounds sad - it seems that Biotwarn is rapidly skipping.  The fact of the matter is that EA needs a long-term income spread over many years, and BioWare does not know how else to achieve this. </p><br><h1 id="epic-vylozhili-plan-razvitiya-epic-store-pryamo-v-trello">  Epic laid out a development plan for the Epic Store right in Trello </h1><br><p>  <a href="https://trello.com/b/GXLc34hk/epic-games-store-roadmap">You can see here</a> . </p><br><h1 id="igry-iz-steam-teper-mozhno-strimit-kuda-ugodno">  Games from Steam can now stream anywhere </h1><br><p>  Previously, Steam Link worked only within the same Wi-Fi network - conditionally, so that it works at home inside the apartment.  Now you can upgrade the client to beta and enjoy the <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/app/353380/discussions/0/3362406825533023360/">work of Steam Link Anywhere</a> .  Now you can play from anywhere, with the exception of devices on iOS (they did not agree with Apple about purchases bypassing the AppStore). </p><br><h1 id="novye-setevye-api-steam-skazhi-net-ddos-atakam">  New Steam Network APIs: Say No to DDoS Attacks </h1><br><p>  Steam rolled out a <a href="https://partner.steamgames.com/doc/api/ISteamNetworkingSockets">new API</a> that allows you to shift the load on your lines.  In fact, they invented client routing.  That is, it is possible to choose a route and endpoint, including with optimal latency.  Stems checked how to improve ping with the help of the new API and saw this picture: </p><br><p><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/hw/-w/-0/hw-w-05nfioy-tokjs3mhmi_xtc.jpeg"></p><br><p>  Based on data on 16 million compounds, they found that: </p><br><ul><li>  43% improved ping </li><li>  25% received a gain of 10 ms and higher </li><li>  10% received a gain of 40 ms and higher </li></ul><br><h1 id="kayatsya-i-molitsya-stopgame-zabanili-na-twitch">  Repent and pray: Game-space banned on Twitch: </h1><br><p>  Twitch Game-space banned.  They repented, which was to be expected.  Remorse <a href="https://stopgame.ru/newsdata/37402">can be read</a> right there on the site. </p><br><blockquote>  One of our authors allowed himself an unacceptable racist statement during a live broadcast on Twitch.  We deeply condemn this author, collectively repent of his deed and have vowed never to miss anything like this in our broadcasts.  The channel blocking time remains undefined: by default, we are imprisoned for 30 days, but we may receive a parole and exit after 10 days. </blockquote><p>  Hmmm, since Twitch‚Äôs employees never know what all the participants of the site <em>really</em> think about their rules.  But stopgeymovtsev can understand: there is something you want, but without Twitch, the caviar on the bouthers will surely be reduced, and the yachts will have nothing to fill.  Practically anyone in their situation would do the same. </p><br><h1 id="phoenix-point-stal-ocherednym-eksklyuzivom-epic-store">  Phoenix Point has become another exclusive Epic Store </h1><br><p>  This was also <a href="https://phoenixpoint.info/epic">reported on</a> March 12 by the creator of PhenixPoint, Jullian Gollop. </p><br><p>  Backers on Kickstarter were naturally indignant, and here's the result: now they will be handed 2 copies of the game, in each of the stores. </p><br><p>  The game scored on Kickstarter more than 765 thousand dollars from 47 thousand backers, but the minters decided to issue refunds only 1300, and quite a bit joined them later.  It looks like the size of the madness about EGS is exaggerated.  I wonder if they could be exaggerated by Epic themselves?  It would be funny, though it looks like conspiracy theories. </p><br><h1 id="podderzhka-dzhoystikov-nintendo-v-google-chrome---no-zachem">  Nintendo joystick support in Google Chrome - but why? </h1><br><p>  There are scary people who develop Chromium at the same time and are interested in games.  And they noticed that <a href="https://chromium-review.googlesource.com/c/chromium/src/%2B/1510080">Chromium‚Äôs changelog</a> and <a href="https://bugs.chromium.org/p/chromium/issues/detail%3Fid%3D801717">bug tracker</a> featured support for Joy-Con and Nintendo Switch Pro Controller.  Google didn't say anything publicly about it, so maybe they just decided to postpone the announcement until something big, like GDC 2019. </p><br><p>  Earlier it became known that at GDC Google will hold its own presentation, and there will be Ubisoft and id Software.  What is unclear.  But the wait is not long, it will take place on March 19 at 20.00 Moscow time - this is the next day! </p><br><p>  But there was a teaser! </p><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/HJclcGp8K_4" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><h1 id="microsoft-rasskazala-o-xbox-live-dlya-ios-i-android">  Microsoft talked about Xbox Live for iOS and Android </h1><br><p>  Achivki, friends, Gamerscore, statistics, clubs and family access settings.  You can include only what is needed by a specific developer. </p><br><p><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/mf/u-/j2/mfu-j223l-b87v9-fihzznm56nk.png"></p><br><p>  They also formulated the Microsoft Game Stack: DirectX, Mixer, Power BI, Havok, Visual Studio, Windows, Xbox Game Studios, Xbox Live, Simplygon, Azure, and PlayFab. </p><br><p><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/ix/m_/qn/ixm_qngyte1-oucyifelsi9l1uq.png"></p><br><p>  In fact, it's all the same Phil Spencer's cross-platform policy - cross-play, cross-progress, cross-all.  It is clear that this cross-country character is only within their platforms, and the evil competitors are not so happy with this idea, so it is unlikely that all of this will appear on Ploika and Switche. </p><br><h1 id="pekarnya-okazalas-vtoroy-po-populyarnosti-platformoy-dlya-monster-hunter-world">  The bakery was the second most popular platform for Monster Hunter: World </h1><br><p>  <a href="https://www.pcgamesinsider.biz/news/68704/pc-is-monster-hunter-worlds-second-largest-platform-capcom-says/%3Fref%3Ddtf.ru">Suddenly, it turned out</a> that MHW sold best on Ploika and PC. </p><br><p>  "Without going into details, PC is the second most popular platform for Monster Hunter: World. Therefore, the PC market is incredibly important to us."  - said Antoine Molan, Capcom's Marketing Director for the UK and EMEA.  Well, that is, did not say anything :-) But at least officially fixed this opinion. </p><br><p>  We pulled sales on the PC, suddenly, Russia and Germany. </p><br><h1 id="v-indii-nachali-sazhat-za-pubg-mobile">  India began to plant for PUBG Mobile </h1><br><p>  Siriusli.  Indian authorities <a href="https://twitter.com/CP_RajkotCity/status/1103757942497538048/photo/1">believe</a> that shkolota studies so badly not because of the lack of talent of teachers, but because of the popularity of PUBG.  The decree was invented on March 9, and it will act until March 30.  And so, the <a href="https://www.timesnownews.com/technology-science/article/pubg-ban-10-people-reportedly-arrested-for-playing-pubg-mobile-battle-royale-game-mobile-phones-seized-for-investigation-rajkot-report/382311">test landings</a> began.

In theory, this should improve performance, but the living people who confirm this are not yet visible.  I remind you that before DX12 was an exclusive Windows 10, and so far it has not been announced for Win 8, and Windows 7 support ends in January 2020. </p><br><h1 id="otkuda-ninja-cherpaet-chemodany-babla">  Where Ninja scoops suitcases dough </h1><br><p>  Recently, the ratings of Ninja have somewhat faded away.

It is called <a href="https://wasd.tv/">WASD.TV</a> , and in my opinion this is a terrible name for two reasons: firstly, the Starper tv.  Secondly, it wasd that no matter how nifiga reflects console gamers.  Just like Mixer, there is an experience that cannot be bought for real, but for which you can buy transitions to streams (1000 XP = 100 transitions).  There are two fun parties - ‚ÄúLeague of Streamers‚Äù and ‚ÄúLeague of Gambit‚Äù.  Streamers compete for the ratio of hours of stream to the number of praises with a prize of 5 lemons rubles, and Gambit is a cyber sporting competition. </p><br><p>  In early March, another platform, <a href="https://esport.tele2.ru/">Cyberhero</a> launched in Tele2.  Everybody went crazy on streaming, everyone considers themselves to be equal to Microsoft.  Maybe someone will succeed, but unlikely. </p><br><h1 id="division-2-ne-trebuet-zapuschennogo-epic-game-store">  Division 2 does not require running Epic Game Store </h1><br><p>  And finally, good news.  At Reset Era <a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/now-that-the-division-2-is-out-ive-figured-out-the-real-reason-for-ubi-choosing-epic-store.104821/">, we noticed</a> that to launch Division 2 you do not need to have EGS running.  And this means that, most likely, EGS does not take a share of the microtransactions built into the game, as Steam does. </p><br><h1 id="konec">  the end </h1><br><p>  I continue to observe.  I remind you that this text is a continuation of the live dialogue <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3DXZtV3HkiSdk">going on YouTube</a> , so if you disagree with something, then this is fixable.  You should not bring suitcases of dough, the apartment is small, there is no place to put anything - as he wrote, and I will continue to write. </p></div>
