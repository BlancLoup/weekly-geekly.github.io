And only on the facade shine three letters: "N", "Y" and "4".  This is the data center, where the servers of one of the most important centers of world trade and the main trading platform of the USA are located.  Much of the transactions conducted through the terminals of the New York Stock Exchange are serviced by server hardware inside NY4.  And this data center belongs to the American company Equinix.  Connecting to the NYSE via telecommunications cables that run along the bottom of the Hudson River. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/6b4/144/1d1/6b41441d1b6545b0a834ec65080eecd0.jpg"><br><br><a name="habracut"></a>  In appearance, the NY4 building is quite unremarkable, and it is located on the outskirts among abandoned trailers and wastelands.  Looking at the opening picture it is difficult to believe that equipment has been assembled in this building, which is the most important element of the US financial system.  The useful space inside the commercial data center Equinix is ‚Äã‚Äãleased by 49 different exchanges.  The area NY4 occupies 32 thousand m <sup>2</sup> .  By reducing the length of fiber-optic cable between the data center servers and business partners, it is possible to win valuable fractions of a second and speed up transaction processing.  Only in February 2016, it was possible to generate a record 9.6 million transactions per second that went through numerous fiber optic cables.  Every day, during electronic trading, trillions of dollars pass through the data center in the form of contracts for the purchase and sale of shares, currencies and other assets.

    <img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/124/5ce/71c/1245ce71ca084dc18a0c5679cd9d0840.jpg"><br><br>  But NY4 is one of Equinix's many commercial data centers, with a capitalization of $ 22.2 billion.  For a better idea of ‚Äã‚Äãthe size of the company's business and the position in the colocation services market, it is enough to cite one fact.  The total market value of the five closest competitors in the US market roughly corresponds to Equinix's market capitalization (according to Bloomberg news agency). <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/58e/c7b/3c4/58ec7b3c4b414d269579ace83f7a3a4d.png"><br><br>  For the past 20 years, the company has been consolidating its own data centers from Frankfurt to Tokyo, London, Rio de Janeiro and Sydney.  Equinix data center is not just a place to store servers.  The company also gives customers the opportunity to locate their server systems at a minimum distance from the equipment of other popular Equinix tenants like ICAP, Chicago Board Options Exchange, Nasdaq, etc.  Equinix customers include: Amazon.com, AT &amp; T, China Mobile, Facebook, Hulu, LinkedIn, Microsoft, Netflix, Pandora, Comcast, and Verizon. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/da3/86a/010/da386a01035e4872b2577126701b9fc8.jpg"><br><br>  An analyst for SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inder Singh, calls Equinix an "800-pound gorilla" among data center operators, acting as an intermediary between customers and service providers. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/cff/127/420/cff127420d134b1a91c48f5845da5172.jpg"><br><br>  The network infrastructure inside the data center connects equipment owned by more than 6.3 thousand enterprises.  It is distributed among the mounting racks and individual customer zones, which are designated by sequence numbers and do not contain information about the names of tenants. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/db7/63a/dae/db763adaeaf54fdc884d0c40151d0862.jpg"><br><br>  Given the scale of customer activity, NY4 pays special attention to data center security.  On the way from the parking of the data center to the nearest server location, the visitor will have to pass through five checkpoints.  Probably the most remarkable of them is the lock cabin with two automatic steel doors that never open at the same time.  It is possible to pass through these doors only after confirming the fingerprint (you need to put a palm on the scanner twice) and enter the PIN code.  Everywhere in the building there are video cameras that allow the security service to view and control every corner of the data center. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/5bd/9c9/a92/5bd9c9a925104873af1da10cea269e06.jpg"><br><br>  NY4 has a powerful server cooling system.  The building has 12 powerful air conditioners that pump cold air into the halls through air ducts.  The designers and builders of the data center made the NY4 ceiling high enough (about 8 m) to keep the temperature at the right level.  A huge number of trays for cables and ventilation channels of the cooling system completely covers the ceiling. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/f8f/e71/0a5/f8fe710a59824acb99d4532a1f0b2489.jpg"><br><br>  The listed equipment contributes to the achievement of a high level of reliability.  According to representatives of Equinix, the average uptime of all data centers of colocation providers was 99.9999% (for 2015).  The data center has an uninterrupted power supply system of 5.6 thousand rechargeable batteries, which are capable of supporting electricity supply for eight minutes.  During this time, diesel generator sets will be activated.  The data center has 18 generators, each of which generates 2.5 megawatts of electricity. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/3ad/457/a76/3ad457a76cda4a05a9eed8943b017295.jpg"><br><br>  To extend the operating time from the DGS, several tanks for diesel fuel were placed near NY4 (total capacity - 681 thousand liters).  In the event of a malfunction of the air conditioner or chiller, the data center operators can use water tanks (total capacity - 568 thousand liters), previously cooled to a temperature of 45 degrees Fahrenheit.  This will give 20 minutes to troubleshoot the air conditioner system. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/86b/ae0/8d1/86bae08d153c4f618d016c15cc2970bc.jpg"><br><br>  And finally, a tip from Equinix's chief financial manager, John Knuff (John Knuff): <br><blockquote>  Always keep your customers close and your suppliers even closer </blockquote></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/259537/">https://habr.com/ru/post/259537/</a></p>
