We decided not to delay and did it today. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  The main task, which is solved by another castling of hubs, is an even more distinct thematic distinction between Habr and Hiktimes.  Make it so that authors and companies no longer have difficulties in choosing a site for publishing a publication. <br><br>  It is only at first glance that it seems easy to draw a line between two closely related projects.  But in practice, this requires some time to collect data, statistics, accumulation of various ‚Äúexceptions to the rules‚Äù in order to understand what adjustments to make in the future.

      Now the rule is simple: <br><br><ul><li>  Habr - about the work of programmers, engineers, developers, system administrators, managers, designers and IT managers;  about the challenges they face and about the solutions they find.  Habr is a professional resource. </li><li>  Giktayms - about hobbies and interests outside the professional field of activity.  Popular science materials, gadgets, games, robots, health, that's all.  Giktayms - entertainment resource. </li></ul><br><h3>  What exactly moved to Habr? </h3><br><ul><li>  One of the most ‚Äúnoisy‚Äù hubs - ‚ÄúRegulation of the IT sector‚Äù - has teamed up with the hub ‚ÄúElectronic Government‚Äù and joined the ‚Äú <a href="https://habr.com/hub/business-laws/">Legislation in IT</a> ‚Äù.  Our study of hubs showed that in most cases, for more coverage, the authors simply prescribed these hubs as synonyms, so we decided not to produce entities. <br><br>  Why did we return ‚Äúpolitical‚Äù to Habr (we draw your attention to quotes and ask to distinguish discreet and constructive discussion of legislative initiatives from drafts and discussion of politics in their pure form, and even more so in an insulting manner)?  Because <a href="https://habr.com/search/%3Ftarget_type%3Dposts%26q%3D%25D1%2580%25D0%25BE%25D1%2581%25D0%25BA%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BC%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B0%25D0%25B4%25D0%25B7%25D0%25BE%25D1%2580%26order_by%3Ddate">recent events</a> show that this activity is increasingly affecting the entire sphere as a whole, and there is no longer any reason to hide from it.  Unfortunately, and perhaps fortunately, politics has come into the lives of developers, administrators, managers, designers, and all-all-all employed in the high-tech industry. </li><li>  Hub " <a href="https://habr.com/hub/circuit-design/">Circuitry</a> ".  At your numerous requests. </li><li>  Hubs "Arduino" and "Raspberry Pi" returned to Habr and turned into " <a href="https://habr.com/hub/arduino/">Development for Arduino</a> " and " <a href="https://habr.com/hub/raspberrypi/">Development on Raspberry Pi</a> ".  Now everything that is connected with "arduinka" or "raspberry" should be placed on Habr. <br><br>  At the same time, the ‚Äú <a href="https://geektimes.com/hub/DIY/">DIY</a> ‚Äù hub still remained at Geektimes.  Here the separation should be based more on intuition, and even better: project as work on Habr, project as a hobby on Hikttimes. </li><li>  ‚ÄúAndroid‚Äù and ‚ÄúiOS‚Äù hubs migrated and merged with the ‚Äú <a href="https://habr.com/hub/android_dev/">Development for Android</a> ‚Äù and ‚Äú <a href="https://habr.com/hub/ios_dev/">Development for iOS</a> ‚Äù hubs.  But it at all not a reason to publish there reviews of new iPhone or Android-device - for this purpose on Geektimes hubs " <a href="https://geektimes.com/hub/smartphones/">Smartphones</a> " and " <a href="https://geektimes.com/hub/gadgets/">Gadgets</a> " were carefully preserved. </li><li>  Hubs Linux, MacOS, OpenSource, Windows, Windows Phone, Browsers left Hiktimes and joined the corresponding hubs on the Hub. </li><li>  The hub " <a href="https://geektimes.com/hub/cryptocurrency/">Cryptocurrency</a> " remained on Giktayms, but from there moved the hub "Decentralized Systems", which merged with the hub " <a href="https://habr.com/hub/p2p/">Decentralized networks</a> ."  I really do not want Habr to be covered with a layer of posts about the crypt, which is nowhere to go, although it seems that many are already tired. <br></li><li>  The <a href="https://habr.com/hub/infosecurity/">Information Security</a> hub existed on both sites, and the publications were shared by eye in terms of complexity, and for many it was a problem.  That there were no dilemmas, they transferred everything to Habr, where this hub was and remains the largest and most popular. </li><li>  Similarly, the hubs "Cloud Services" and " <a href="https://habr.com/hub/programming/">Programming</a> " were duplicated, which also moved to Habr in the hubs of the same name. </li><li>  The ‚Äú <a href="https://geektimes.com/hub/soft/">Soft</a> ‚Äù hub remained on Hiktaimes about any software as such (from the capabilities of the new iOS to the review of the clipboard managers), to which the ‚ÄúOperating Systems‚Äù hub and some publications were transferred. </li></ul><br>  You should not look for hidden meanings - these steps are not the beginning of the path to the complete reunion of all the hubs in a single Habr√©.  We just tried to separate the sites even more clearly, to separate the entertainment from the professional, and it took time.  By the way, the audience of Habra and Geektimes overlaps only partly: now, on average, about 31% of users come from Habr to Geektimes, and from Heiktimes to Habr - 59%. <br><br>  If you see any anomalies on the site, do not rush to beat the bells - until tomorrow the indices, ratings and other counters will be recalculated.  Habr is <a href="https://habr.com/company/tm/blog/345916/">big</a> , you can not imagine how big;  it takes time to get everything settled. <br><br>  If you think that your publication should be transferred from a resource to a resource, please write to <a href="https://habr.com/feedback/">the support service</a> . <br><br><h3>  But that's not all. </h3><br>  Now we are working on a unified system of entities that will become a ‚Äúskeleton‚Äù for our projects and will allow us to more closely link the hubs on Habr√©, tags from the Toaster, skills from My circle and Freelance.  This is a rather big task (which also requires multilingualism), as a result of which there will be a lot of niche hubs on Habr√©.  Lots of.  As much as it has never been before.  But all this is to restore order, and not to introduce chaos. <br><br>  If you have questions or suggestions, feel free to write them in the comments. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/357978/">https://habr.com/ru/post/357978/</a></p>
