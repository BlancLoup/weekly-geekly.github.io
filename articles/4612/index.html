  <section class="page js-page"><h1>GooYahoo or MicroYahoo? Terry camel time to think about the future</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  The decline in financial performance in the 3rd quarter of 2006 forces <a href="http://www.yahoo.com/">Yahoo</a> to look for a ‚Äúway to salvation‚Äù.  Stock brokers are disappointed: falling interest of users and, as a result, profits negatively affect the stock price, which is especially noticeable against the triumph of <a href="http://www.google.com/">Google</a> , whose shares are pushing up everything from the expectation of billions of "advertising" profits to the release of Firefox. <br><br>  <a href="http://www.habrahabr.ru/lenta/1136/">Buying AdInterax</a> , <a href="http://www.habrahabr.ru/article/1188/">rumors of talks with FaceBook</a> - all of this should, according to Yahoo‚Äôs CEO Terry Saamela, somehow cheer Wall Street.  In addition, <a href="http://money.cnn.com/magazines/fortune">Fortune</a> writes that Yahoo may be negotiating with <a href="http://www.timewarner.com/">TimeWarner</a> to purchase <a href="http://www.aol.com/">AOL</a> ;  however, there is no exact information on this issue yet: some sources claim that negotiations are under way, others say that they have already failed.  For Saamel, such rumors are only on hand: he needs to convince the market that Yahoo is not giving up, and last year‚Äôs loss in the fight against Google for 5% of AOL‚Äôs shares would mean nothing if he now can buy much more.  At the moment, the situation is perceived as a loss: Google as a result of the transaction became the main partner of AOL in the field of search and, of course, advertising. <br><br>  The fate of Yahoo is still in question.  While Google and <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/">Microsoft</a> completed the next quarter with, to put it mildly, quite good indicators and only in October presented several interesting proposals to the users for trial, Terry Saamela company clearly reduced turnover.  A fairly modest cost - about $ 40 billion - allows analysts to think about whether it makes sense for Yahoo to invest in new projects or better sell the business to some of its competitors.  The competitors themselves are also probably already looking at the ‚Äútasty morsel‚Äù, especially since, for example, Google is ready to spend on new purchases an amount comparable to the current value of Yahoo.  Moreover, using the stock payment scheme worked out on <a href="http://www.youtube.com/">YouTube</a> , you will not have to spend the entire investment budget to buy a competitor Sergey Brin at once.

      Of course, Yahoo‚Äôs takeover by Bill Gates is more likely.  After all, Google for Yahoo is a real ‚Äúred rag‚Äù that has annoyed and diverted profits from under its nose for more than a year.  Do not forget that in the fight against the leader of the search sphere, Yahoo and Microsoft are sometimes on the same side of the barricades: it‚Äôs enough to recall the most recent example of their cooperation - the <a href="http://www.habrahabr.ru/lenta/1168/">appearance of the new version of Internet Explorer 7 on the Yahoo website a day before the official release</a> .  Some additional features were built into the IE-Yahoo version, and this is clear evidence that Microsoft provided them with the final browser version in a few days, and maybe even weeks before it was presented to ordinary users. <br><br>  In public, Terry Semel always says that his company will move forward, improving contextual advertising technologies in search results, as well as developing new directions - advertising for mobile devices, video content, and social networks.  This really is time to do, otherwise Jeremy Clockwork will cease to be the only employee of Yahoo, in whose <a href="http://jeremy.zawodny.com/blog/">blog</a> Google Adsense blocks will be placed.  (By the way, a couple of days ago he had to remove them, after Dana Bogatin, one of the most famous US network analysts, <a href="http://blogs.zdnet.com/micro-markets/%3Fp%3D594">drew attention</a> to this "inconsistency.") <br><br>  If Yahoo really clearly aims at moving towards ‚Äúsocialization‚Äù, in the near future we should see new acquisitions: AdInterax alone is hardly enough to improve advertising technologies.  Rumors about buying Facebook probably have a real reason.  And if this deal - or any other in the field of advertising and social networks - does not take place in the next couple of months, then in a year MicroYahoo or GooYahoo will become a reality. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/4612/">https://habr.com/ru/post/4612/</a></p>
