Part 1</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  I wanted to post a blog about trading, but does not give - little karma <br><br>  <b>Trading</b> is essentially a very complex and time-consuming type of business.  At the same time, many perceive it as a way to millions, work on oneself.  Deals can be made on your own yacht in some Tahiti, live in a big way, travel, drive on steep wheelbarrows ... <br><br>  In principle, this is possible, but let's try to understand some key points that bring chaos to this idyll when it comes to realizing such a picture of the world in life.  So <b>how to make money being a trader</b> ?

    <a name="habracut"></a><br>  <b>1.</b> In order to earn enough by trading, you need to be an <b>expert</b> in this business.  Understand what and how everything happens here, go through fire, water and copper pipes and <b>stay in the game</b> . <br><br>  <b>2.</b> The next important point: you need to work with serious capital.  They say that <b>professional traders</b> do not work at their own expense, but manage the funds of investors.  This is called private trust management.  A commission and bonuses from trust management and allow you to live in a big way.  Investors, in turn, also suffer from the questions: how and where is it better and more profitable to invest free money in a crisis? <br><br>  <b>3.</b> In addition to the fact that a trader must be able to earn money, he must also have certain necessary qualities, such as the <b>ability to apply and attract people</b> .  Next, we analyze this moment in more detail. <br><br>  I repeat once again that ALL WHO STAYED IN TRADING AFTER A FEW YEARS OF TRADE (as a rule, this is not the most profitable period and for many is simply associated with loss of funds) - CAN BE COUNTED FOR SUCCESS IN THE QUALITY OF EMPLOYERS.  Because they survived.  God only knows what they had to go through, but that did not break them.  And this is an indicator.  Such a person may not have an accumulated state, but the very fact that a person stubbornly hammer at one point - speaks of innate perseverance and determination.  And that's all you need. <br><br>  In the end, my opinion is that all the troubles and frustrations among the traders are related to the fact that they have to work for their own means, which are quite small.  And the profit they can get from these funds cannot be compared with voltage and power consumption.  From here, the MAIN ERRORS are OVERHEATED RISKS, TRADE IN THE STYLE OF "PAN OR BROKEN" AND THE PSYCHOLOGICAL STRESS, WHICH ATTRACTS FROM THE RULES OF THE TS. <br><br>  Is there a way out of this situation?  Of course.  You need <b>to look for an investor</b> who invests so much that you can put a risk on a deal of <b>1-3%</b> and clearly realize that even <b>30% per annum</b> will allow you to have everything you dreamed of when you came into this business. <br><br>  <b>So the trader went to look for an investor ...</b> <br><br>  It‚Äôs ridiculous to say, but <b>99% of</b> investors on the forums are <u>talkers</u> who, holding a couple thousand dollars in a sweaty fist, smartly announce a tender for traders with states for several years, guarantees of a break-even and almost a monthly profit of <b>100%</b> .  This is lol.  And as soon as it comes to real investment, even these pennies do not go to traders.  Having raised his nose, our "investor" proudly leaves, since he has not found any decent ones. <br><br>  We will not repeat the mistakes of the others, but we will go the other way. <br><br>  And I will tell you how an investor wanted to invest 100k in me, and why nothing came of it. <br><br>  <i>to be continued...</i> <br><br>  the original is on my <a href="http://deipara.com/">blog Japanese trader</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/77156/">https://habr.com/ru/post/77156/</a></p>
