  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Already a year we create an operator together</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/70b/fa7/d48/70bfa7d484ef494793ce6ae56e65bf49.jpg"><br><br>  Friends, exactly one year ago, on September 17, 2014, we launched the ‚Äú <a href="http://www.yota.ru/idea/">Create an operator together</a> ‚Äù communication platform.  For a year now we have been openly saying that we are creating a mobile operator together with users and for users.  Absolutely every client can offer new functionality for Yota and thus help make the operator even more convenient - and as far as possible we will implement some of the ideas.  During the year of the project‚Äôs existence, many worthy proposals were received, some of which received a start in life.  And today we would like to talk about what has already been implemented and how much interesting remains to be done. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h3>  The ability to establish a VPN connection on the smartphone </h3><br>  The first idea we embodied was the ability to use a VPN connection on smartphones.  To tell you the truth, we initially did not plan to introduce such functionality, and the first one, but it turned out that VPN on smartphones is very much in demand, especially among readers of the blog on Habr√© - it was here in the comments to the post a year ago that this idea was sounded.  It was simply impossible not to respond to this, and VPN support <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/yota/blog/238297/">was quickly implemented</a> . <br><br><h3>  Transfer to Yota with room retention and without a visit to the office </h3><br>  For many people, changing a mobile operator is fraught with a huge amount of inconvenience.  All because over the years of use various services and accounts have become attached to our numbers, our numbers have been kept by various important people with whom we need to keep and keep in touch.  Therefore, the transfer of the number when changing the mobile operator for many is the key point.  However, we already live in a constant time trouble, ‚Äúand then go somewhere with a passport to transfer the number?  No, now there is no time. ‚Äù  Users voiced this idea on the site, and we found a solution, and now the courier can bring along with the SIM card an application for number transfer.

    <h3>  SIM card for tablet </h3><br>  In this case, users offered to release for tablets a separate type of SIM-cards, which have no download speed limit when using mobile Internet.  As they say, it is said - <a href="http://www.rspectr.com/news/yota-sim-karty-dlya-planshetov/">done</a> . <br><br><h3>  Using a smartphone as an access point to the Internet for a fee </h3><br>  Yota has always sought to give its customers the most convenient product.  If you need unlimited Internet only for large screens (laptop, stationary computer), then the client can choose a <a href="http://www.yota.ru/modem/">modem</a> ;  if you only need internet on your smartphone or tablet - mobile operator.  At the launch of the operator, we provided a free tethering option at a speed of 1 Mbit, which allowed us to ensure stable network operation, while customers distributed the Internet unlimitedly.  However, the distribution of the Internet via Wi-Fi is not the intended use of Internet access from a tablet or smartphone, although we understand that sometimes our clients may have situations when it is necessary, and at more than 1 Mbps speed.  Therefore, when an offer came from a user, we implemented a short-term access to tethering service.  If it is necessary to distribute unlimited Internet to other devices, a client using a Yota SIM card for a tablet or smartphone can choose the time he needs - two hours or a day, without any restrictions on speed and traffic.  This service is demanded by users who, for a number of reasons, are inconvenient to use other solutions for distributing the Internet. <br><br><h3>  Test drive operator Yota </h3><br>  It is a logical and understandable desire to try the product before making a purchase decision.  It seemed to us the right idea to give each user the opportunity to test our services and evaluate their quality - for this reason we decided to implement it.  In the spring of 2015, we <a href="http://www.sotovik.ru/news/240162-yota-podarit-mesjac-besplatnogo-obshhenija.html">launched a large-scale campaign ‚ÄúMonth for Free‚Äù</a> , thanks to which customers could use the services of a mobile operator for a month for free.  This offer was also made by our users on the site. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/43c/855/0c2/43c8550c248643f09451239dc41b5feb.jpg"><br><br><h3>  Select a number in the mobile application </h3><br>  The Yota mobile application is convenient for several reasons, and one of its advantages for the client is that it allows you to provide convenient service management without visiting the point of sale.  So, it would be unfair to deprive our users of the opportunity to choose a certain number when ordering a SIM card (if it is not already busy, of course), as it can be done in any cellular phone salon.  And at the moment you can not just choose a number, but also change it directly in the application, choosing a beautiful or just the desired combination of numbers. <br><br><h3>  Chat push notifications and saving its history </h3><br>  The main channel of communication with customer support for customers of a mobile operator is a chat, which can be accessed both from our portal <a href="http://www.yota.ru/">www.yota.ru</a> and from the application.  Some time after its launch, users asked to implement the preservation of the history of communication with consultants.  Previously, when the window was closed, all correspondence was reset.  But there are situations when the client needs to return to discussing the issue with a consultant from the support service, and the chat is already completely empty, since the session has been completed.  And if a person also changed, he had to explain the situation anew.  Naturally, this was inconvenient, so we recorded the history of communication with customer support. <br><br>  Also, at the request of users, we added a push-notification stating that the consultant had written something in the chat.  After all, do not sit looking at the screen while waiting for an answer. <br><br><h3>  Binding cards for payment </h3><br>  A simple and obvious thing in the age of electronic payments and high technologies is to <a href="http://telecom.cnews.ru/news/line/yota_realizoval_privyazku_bankovskih">save the bank card data in a mobile application</a> .  Conveniently, you do not need to drive in details every time.  Moreover, very few people remember them by heart, they are not always at hand and each time you have to go into wallets.  Today, about 30% of our customers pay for services using linked bank cards, and this figure continues to grow.  We cannot fail to note that this is a record figure for the Russian telecom market, and such a high proportion indicates that our audience keeps up with the times. <br><br>  * * * <br><br>  Of course, the ‚ÄúCreate an operator together‚Äù project does not end there.  Now the work is pleased to other suggestions from users, a complete list can be found on our website: <a href="http://www.yota.ru/idea/">http://www.yota.ru/idea/</a> .  Among them, for example, there are several about international roaming, autopayment function in a mobile application, payment for services using a phone - and many others.  For various reasons - due to the peculiarities of a technical nature, legislative regulation or business conditions - not all of the wishes we can implement.  Nevertheless, we are trying to do what we can realize, because even one sentence can change a lot. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/ZGm7BQs8zTw%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700021,15700186,15700190,15700248,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhjKehV9wAtiyYlaxgD_LDdDZyozPQ" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  If you have ideas that are not reflected on the project page, be sure to submit your suggestions!  We will carefully consider each of them, and the most deserving will receive a chance to see the light.  And remember - what will be Yota, you decide! </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/267071/">https://habr.com/ru/post/267071/</a></p>
