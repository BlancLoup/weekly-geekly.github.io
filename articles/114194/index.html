We make a user manual</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  The modern world is gradually moving to the storage of all information known to it from a paper form to a digital one, respectively, the main question arises, the question of the protection of this information. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/habraeffect/e6/2c/e62c0a1405e1574883c4362fcc7d495d.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><br>  <strong>The whole world is a data warehouse</strong> <br>  <em>Photo from <a href="https://lori.ru/">Lori's photobank.</a></em> <em><br></em> <br>  The responsibility of IT department specialists to neutralize all sorts of risks and ensure a general atmosphere that ensures a sufficient degree of data storage security is growing.  Working with information stored in digital form is very comfortable, but, as you know, danger lurks us at every turn.  In case of fires and other natural disasters, modern carriers are as defenseless as paper, bark or papyrus.  But, if with natural threats of our information everything is more or less clear, for example, compliance with fire safety techniques and keeping copies in a different place, territorial and logical, then with threats that are not of such a global nature, the situation is somewhat more complicated. <br><a name="habracut"></a>

      Very often, the threat of losing data from electronic media occurs through carelessness, inattention, due to lack of necessary knowledge or, frankly, is a consequence of the carelessness of employees.  How else to call the devil-may-care attitude to the problem of organizing secure data storage, which prevails in many firms and companies.  Yes, and ordinary users sin.  It is more difficult for them, since the amount of information is growing exponentially, and it is not always enough knowledge about organizing archiving. <br>  Every day we are confronted with the despair of specialists who have lost valuable information, with the tears of lovely girls who have lost photos of their loved ones or their essays, we help, comfort, explain.  Plunging every day into the problems of our Customers and identifying the causes of information loss, we explain to them what rules to follow, what steps to take if they do not want to become our regular customers. <br>  Based on the data collected, we have compiled and published <a href="https://www.datarc.ru/articles/10_sposobov_izbezhat_poteri_dannyh.html">on our website a small manual of 10 points</a> .  If you follow these tips, the probability of losing important data will tend to zero, and, no matter what it is, a family photo archive or an array of results with serious scientific research. <br>  I want to share with you a fresh example of the ‚Äúoriginal way of data loss.‚Äù  A few days ago a case occurred in the St. Petersburg branch about which our specialist wrote, frankly, a literary account of the adventures at the weekend.  When dealing with such cases it is very difficult to stay within the framework of dry reporting. <br><br>  ‚ÄúA tale about how a client was twice in one weekend, he restored his data. <br><br>  There was a wonderful, frosty Saturday evening.  Frost was, I tell you, good.  This, which only in the fairy tales of Russian yes epic happens.  The tip of the nose bites, but the hem pulls.  I am with my girlfriend, read for my wife's place, I drank tea.  Strong, hot, and with strawberry jam.  It was past seven in the evening ... <br>  Call! <br>  - "Hello, people are kind, help out ..." (well, then as usual). <br>  I sighed deeply, and went to the office, in order to help the poor fellow of the miserable, north-capital client, out of trouble. <br>  How long is it short, recovered data.  I recorded it on a CD overseas and went home, warm tea and a friend.  Here is the end of the Sabbath, and whoever listened, let him go and listen further. <br>  Sunday dawned, contributing to sleep.  And it would have passed in him, if it had not been for the client to call that the persistent brother's news of labor.  Called again the unfortunate, my acquaintance.  He told different stories, one another way.  They say, the data disc, they inserted with a partner, in a new raid.  And he took, and asked the question: - ‚ÄúInitialize the disk, or so take it to the family?‚Äù <br>  I scolded him.  And on the mother and on the father kissed.  And everything is empty, we must work again to work.  Littering will not help.  He sat back in his car, that the miscarriage of the rising sun.  And I went to work.  Data on the new recover.  This is the story that happened the other day, as a result of which I lost my well-earned day off, and the reckless customer received the recovered data a second time.  " <br>  This, of course, all the lyrics.  But her example shows that strict compliance by all users with the items described in our manual will help avoid unpleasant situations. <br>  Do you have any additions to our manual?  Offer, we will be grateful for interesting and useful tips. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/114194/">https://habr.com/ru/post/114194/</a></p>
