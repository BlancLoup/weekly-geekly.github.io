  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Free programs: dangers and charms</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Free programs - why do manufacturers make them?  Why do we believe that free software can be of high quality, convenient and secure?  In practice, because of these three points, you have to choose only one.  What is it - faith in the freebie?  And maybe from free programs you need to run like fire, because free cheese happens only in a mousetrap?  Let's try to figure it out! <br><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  During 2013, I followed the free software market with interest.  This was helped by the popular American resource Cnet.com, which has a constantly updated selection of software with detailed statistics that you downloaded and how many times.  I, of course, was interested in new software.  Essentially new.  But I almost did not find such programs.  But a very great success among users enjoyed extremely advanced programs with clear and timeless functionality.  The main thing was that in all of them one common trait could be guessed, which I would formulate in the following way: ‚ÄúThey found how to make money on us!‚Äù.  But should we be afraid of making money on us? <br><br>  For starters, the good.  Popular free programs that I came across had absolutely identical positive features.  First, they really were free and did not directly ask for money.  Secondly, they were really extremely simple in work.  Even a child could use them.  Thirdly, they solved the stated tasks by almost 100%.  Isn't it great?

    <h4>  What is the catch? </h4><br>  In this case, the worm of doubt always asked me a question - what is the catch here?  How and what do manufacturers earn here?  Here are typical ways that I discovered: <br><br>  ‚Ä¢ Installation of additional shareware or free software in the ‚ÄúDefault‚Äù installation mode (here the developer receives money from the creators of the software that comes with it) <br>  ‚Ä¢ Advertising, sometimes unobvious, paid versions of the program.  For example, some sections of the program state that a paid version is required to display content.  Also, occasionally pop-up windows come across offering to update the program for a more functional paid version (this is especially practiced in antivirus software) <br>  ‚Ä¢ Placement of a program for downloading a resource, such as Cnet.com, which is full of paid advertising, part of which can be received by the developer of the program <br><br>  My opinion - the vast majority of users for whom this software is designed, will give the developer some way.  If it seems to you that all this stuff and earn here nothing, then you are a seasoned fighter in the Freeware market.  Go through all the troubles and do not fill your PC with regular plug-ins when installing the next program, sometimes it turns into a real quest. <br><br><h4>  How to safely use free software? </h4><br>  The most frightening thing for me about free software is security issues.  What else does the free program carry?  What else will she install?  Who knows.  Therefore, to all new programs, I am suspicious.  I use them according to the principle - "I installed the program - I solved the problem - I deleted it".  Exactly the same algorithm using Freeware advise everyone.  Just think, we use very few free programs on the PC all the time and you shouldn‚Äôt trust them on your PC all the time. <br><br><h4>  TOP list of free software </h4><br>  In 2013, my list of useful free programs was replenished immediately with several new items from the US rating.  These programs are: <br><br>  ‚Ä¢ Wise Care 365 Free ( <a href="http://wise-care-365.ru/">http://wise-care-365.ru/</a> ) - a free program for cleaning your PC from a variety of software debris and errors.  Attracted by good reviews and the fact that all the work consists in pressing a single button - ‚ÄúFix‚Äù.  That is, the program scans the PC, looks for all possible errors (registry, old system files, etc.) and eliminates all this in one fell swoop.  The popularity of the utility is clear - to understand anything is not required.  Put - launched - deleted.  PC runs faster and more disk space.  The program has a paid version, but the need to purchase it is too doubtful. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/272/53b/220/27253b22086b6b388259c2e7e255e4ae.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  ‚Ä¢ Driver Booster ( <a href="http://driver-booster.ru/">http://driver-booster.ru/</a> ) - a free program for updating drivers on a PC or laptop.  At one time, she received an incredible number of downloads, which made her stand out in the rating and caught my attention.  Softina in the general concept: launched and pressed one button.  I still really like these trends.  Smart software and should do everything myself.  And how nice it is to fuss with all the drivers of the home computer to put on the program with one single ‚ÄúStart‚Äù button.  In general, the program is very pleased with the simplicity and convenience.  Put - launched - deleted. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/bc1/a16/28c/bc1a1628c77a4655b3b06125dad1b592.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  ‚Ä¢ Free antiviruses (the most popular are clearly presented, for example, here: <a href="http://www.besplatnyi-antivirus-skachat-besplatno.ru/">http://www.besplatnyi-antivirus-skachat-besplatno.ru</a> ) - with this software is a bit more complicated.  First, you can only trust the well-known manufacturers of the incoming, for example, Virus Bulletin.  Further, each program has its own nuances and hope for a simple job ‚Äúset and forget‚Äù will not work here.  You will either get advertising and additional services (Avast), or weak protection (Microsoft Security Essentials), or false positives (Avira), etc. ... In general, there are no perfect free solutions.  You choose just the lesser evil.  Although in defense of free antiviruses, it can be said that paid programs are usually even worse.  At least, my experience with Kaspersky or Norton products caused even more negative emotions. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/a6c/d1a/1f0/a6cd1a1f0596f749a1957e6d484cd735.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><h4>  findings </h4><br>  Modern free programs are very convenient tools.  It's really a pleasure to use them, the main thing is to follow reasonable precautions. <br><br>  I would venture to give some advice to those who want to use the free program: <br><br>  ‚Ä¢ Download Freeware only from the developer's site (no file sharing or torrents) <br>  ‚Ä¢ Do not install the program if the PC does not have antivirus <br>  ‚Ä¢ Never use the default setting. <br>  ‚Ä¢ Do not rush to update the free program if it works stably and solves all your problems (the new version may bring new advertising and other inconveniences) <br>  ‚Ä¢ Remove the free program if you don‚Äôt need it in the next few months. <br><br>  These simple recommendations will make your communication with free software safe. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/210012/">https://habr.com/ru/post/210012/</a></p>
