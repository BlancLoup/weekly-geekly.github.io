  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Yota Phone: why such products are needed</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"> Finally I got to the computer - and immediately decided to speak on the Yota Phone theme.  I'm not sure that my thoughts will be perceived unambiguously positively, and yet.  Immediately I will warn you: I am sure that such products are important for the market, and I am personally pleased that at least someone did something unusual - I didn‚Äôt just buy a 5-inch IPS HD Quad Core MediaTek Dual SIM 8 Mpix 8 device in China ", And, competently controlling the Chinese, I created this here. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/f90/69d/523/f9069d523ff67e78e29cc8feac56c25d.jpg"><br><br>  That's right - competently controlling the Chinese.  I am aware that the head of the Rostec corporation, Sergey Chemezov, handed Yota Phone to Dmitry Medvedev with the words that this, he says, is <a href="http://lenta.ru/news/2013/12/04/phone/">‚Äúabsolutely Russian invention‚Äù</a> .  This is a bold statement, and here it depends on what is considered an invention ... The concept of this device is by no means new, and it belongs to clearly not to the guys from Yota Devices.  Because in September 2012, at the IFA exhibition in Berlin, the E Ink corporation demonstrated prototypes of smartphones with exactly the same arrangement of the E Ink and LCD screens - one in front and the other in the back.  (Representatives of Yota Devices were not observed around.) <a name="habracut"></a>
      <br>
        <script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>
        <ins class="adsbygoogle"
          style="display:block; text-align:center;"
          data-ad-layout="in-article"
          data-ad-format="fluid"
          data-ad-client="ca-pub-6974184241884155"

          (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
        </script>
      <br>
      Of course, then it was only about a kind of "portable demonstration stands", prototypes, dummies, which really did not know how.  This is evidenced by the fact that the LCD displays of some of these ‚Äútwo-screen‚Äù devices displayed the Windows Phone interface ‚Äî an operating system that does not support any E-Ink screens, and third-party developers cannot add their support, because they are not supposed to.  Well, yes, what picture was loaded into the memory of the demo device - it was displayed like this ... <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/74b/08f/3d8/74b08f3d81f6faa7ad2fef784b3b6c2b.jpg"><br><br>  Other prototypes, for example, uploaded an image of the Android interface. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/3ee/17d/0f8/3ee17d0f808f4695a3161d15999cd87e.jpg"><br><br>  I will say more - according to my data, devices with E Ink and LCD at the turn of 2012 and 2013.  offered by a number of Chinese factories to many Russian brands selling smartphones.  For example, such a device could go under the brand name Just5 - the same one, it makes phones with large buttons (for example, Brick with a design from Lebedev Studio), and more recently smartphones.  But it did not come out - because it is extremely risky to offer such a ‚Äúnagging‚Äù one.  Unusual, but very expensive and completely incomprehensible to the average consumer.  Yes, and bring it to mind is not as easy as it seems.  The Chinese can make something "blind", and it takes a lot of time and money to make a tasty candy out of it (the result will not be obvious).  And this is no longer a business, but games in a research laboratory - for example, Motorola is engaged in them today.  But she can, for some time she has a very rich and kind daddy ... <br><br>  Sergei Chemezov said in a conversation with Dmitry Medvedev that the Yota Phone is made using five patented Russian developments.  I do not know what it is about, but, for example, Eldar Murtazin mentioned that the device uses non-standard antennas - which is dictated by its ‚Äútwo-screen‚Äù form factor.  Most likely, this is one of the contributions of our compatriots in the creation of the Yota Phone.  Is it a lot or a little?  Of course, the contribution is tangible, but the ‚Äúone hundred percent Russian invention‚Äù is still not discussed ... <br><br>  However, is this important - by how many percent is this Russian smartphone?  It is much more Russian than the notorious MTS 945 GLONASS - this model from ZTE, the first in the world with GLONASS support, called the ‚ÄúRussian analogue of the iPhone‚Äù, definitely had nothing to do with Russia.  Because the MTS took the finished "Chinese" and called it ours.  Although the support of GLONASS in it was provided by a very American chipset, Qualcomm ... Meanwhile, Russian specialists still had a hand on Yota Phone - both to technologies (to a lesser extent) and to management (to a much greater extent).  What, in my opinion, is an achievement. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/051/0f4/871/0510f487165b9b8d77ac88423acecff0.jpg"><br>  MTS 945 GLONASS <br><br>  But the problem with the Yota Phone and the market as a whole is that only two companies are asking trends on it - Apple and Samsung.  If the E Ink screen would appear on the back of the Samsung Galaxy S4 or iPhone 5s, then everyone would have gasped, and in half a year such a component would be in every second smartphone.  And everyone would be amazed - the horror, and how we used to live without this chip?  But if a certain innovation is implemented by a company simpler and smaller, then this innovation risks remaining unnoticed and ignored by the market.  Here again, an example of Motorola Mobility comes to mind: they made Moto X with an online customizer (by the way, it is also not the first of its kind, since something like this existed for HTC Tattoo) - and nothing, everyone made a noise, a smartphone is sold well, but an event for He did not market.  Motorola plans to produce modular phones (like the deceased Israeli Modu) - and there is also no certainty that this will lead to something. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/500/7f3/95a/5007f395a5267704c8bb63a78ad81348.png"><br>  Motorola Modular Smartphone - Project Ara <br><br>  However, all these developments are extremely important.  Because they are a look into the future.  Remember how the Strugatsky in the story "A billion years before the end of the world"?  Yes, the discovery of Malyanova could in the very long term change the history of mankind, and not necessarily with its correctness ‚Äî perhaps, even in error, but it would affect history.  So it is here: attempts to create from scratch and / or at least bring to the market (in the case of the Yota Phone, the second option rather than the first, see above), something completely new is definitely needed.  They hardly ‚Äúshoot‚Äù immediately (they shoot if there is a sign with the word Samsung or Apple on the company's campus, but Yota Devices risks falling into the minus), but in the future they may have such an impact on the market that now it‚Äôs not even possible estimate. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/205822/">https://habr.com/ru/post/205822/</a></p>
