  <section class="page js-page"><h1>E1 allows you to travel without interruption from business</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  The modern rhythm of life obliges us to meet with many people, attend various events, to be in several places almost at the same time, and not only in different cities, and sometimes in different countries.  It is especially important for a person from the business environment to adapt to this pace, and the impossibility of simultaneously staying in different places does not affect the quality and quantity of work done and decisions made, on which the success of the enterprise directly depends. <br>  In the minds of ‚Äúeffective‚Äù managers, it is already firmly established that in order to take a business to a fundamentally new level, not only a competent business strategy is needed, but also a powerful business process automation system that is efficient and easily customized.  At the same time, mobility is becoming an obligatory requirement for the system recently, allowing employees to work in the system from a smartphone or tablet, even while at a meeting or on a business trip. <br>  The E1 Euphrates robotic system has helped a number of companies make business paperless a reality.  EDMS today is being introduced even by companies with a staff of no more than 50 employees, what can we say about Cognitive Technologies with its 683 employees, and besides, with its own development!  In our company, at the moment, not only every workplace is automated, but every personal gadget (well, the current progress allows) workers. <a name="habracut"></a><br>  In addition to the indisputable benefits of EDI within the company, it is important that the SED can help outside it.  That is why the E1 Euphrates mobile client has rightfully become an indispensable assistant in managing business processes outside the office.  The client allows to control all the necessary and ‚Äúvital‚Äù tasks for the company quickly, efficiently and to the maximum is convenient.  With its help, each employee can ‚Äúreactively‚Äù react to a particular assignment / approval / familiarization. <br>  Special ‚Äúlaboratory‚Äù testing of a mobile client is regularly conducted, but it is important not to discard daily tests by our employees, who are active users of the E1 Euphrates mobile client.  One of these tests was, albeit not an ordinary one, a test in the high-speed train Sapsan from Siemens. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/257/4b3/9c3/2574b39c3bcc8af2e72994b080287c3a.jpg"><br><br>  On May Day (happy for the whole country, when labor day is marked by complete idleness :)) many go to the northern capital.  And what is the most convenient way to get from Moscow to St. Petersburg in 4 hours?  In December 2009, the first high-speed train Sapsan was launched, which has already become the most popular long-distance transport for businessmen.  Each train car is equipped with a wireless Internet system.  Wi-Fi in the train operates in test mode and is not announced as a service to passengers.  In fact, the Internet in the Sapsan trains is used to connect the driver with the control center, but most of the time is also available to passengers.  The stability of the Internet connection depends not only on Russian Railways, but also on the technical equipment of all points of the train‚Äôs communication systems. <br>  Our employee, who traveled in the 9th carriage (as it was read on all sorts of forums, the 9th magic car, many of those who connected to the Sapsanov Internet spoke about it), ‚Äúcaught‚Äù Wi-Fi.

At each control point of the route, the time taken to agree on a standard document was measured.  The agreement of the document includes a number of simple steps, the time for the execution of which was also included in the measurements.  This is the opening of the document, viewing the registration control card (RCM), scrolling through the attachment (scrolling) and already the apogee of everything - coordination with the input of a comment. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/133/401/ec7/133401ec78da3d6f60deb0a1fdad0b88.jpg"><br>  <b>Coordination of the document in the E1 mobile client</b> <br><br>  In addition to measuring time, the speed of the Internet connection was measured using the convenient Speedtest.net application.  Also, the use of this application helped to find "Internet holes" (black holes, places with the weakest connection) or simply slowing down the speed of the Internet connection, which in turn affected the measured time values. <br>  As a result, we received a ‚Äúconvenience map‚Äù of business management from a high-quality Sapsan.  Throughout the trip, the maximum Wi-Fi indicators recorded in the train: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/a0a/f08/737/a0af08737614416e7a60627a7c7e0b41.jpg"><br><br>  It was still in the parking lot.  With such connection parameters, the time spent on one coordination was 15.4 seconds on average (1.05 seconds to open the document, 3.45 seconds to view the scrolling, 2 seconds to scroll, 11 seconds to coordinate with the comment input (7.5 seconds input) ; all time indicators are averaged, because at this speed they managed to hold 7 approvals). <br>  The worst of all indicators, naturally different from zero, were: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/f5b/64f/c3a/f5b64fc3a64f4a3559232fa94bf1b3d7.jpg"><br><br>  But even at this speed, we managed to carry out some actions: 3 approvals, the average execution time of which was 2 minutes 16 seconds. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/ceb/2d8/8de/ceb2d88deebbadb9b9465d5111c099fc.jpg"><br>  <b>Convenience Map</b> <br><br>  The figure shows the route of the train.  The most problematic places where there was no connection to the Internet are symbolically indicated by black dots.  Places with the best and worst Internet connection options are also marked in the figure.  For all the time of the train there were 3 stops.  It is for them that the time spent at each stage of coordination at a specific Internet speed is described in more detail. <br><br>  With the parameters of the Internet connection, which were recorded during the trip, it was possible to conduct 126 approvals with the input of a comment (for relatively equal conditions it was necessary to enter the same comment). <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/1d1/e2d/6f3/1d1e2d6f399fb69d64bb37ec18f59a55.jpg"><br>  <b>Input comment for approval</b> <br><br>  The total number of documents agreed for the trip turned out to be quite high.  Thanks to this testing, we managed to make sure that it is possible, even necessary, to manage a business while traveling in Russia!  Instead of losing precious time, and time, as you know, money, you can continue to control business processes.  Thus, 1 allows not to break away from business management, even on the road to the place of business trip or rest. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/144223/">https://habr.com/ru/post/144223/</a></p>
