  <section class="page js-page"><h1>The Ministry of Economic Development proposes to create a single register of statements in order to reduce business costs and reduce bureaucracy</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  The Ministry of Economic Development of the Russian Federation proposes to create a single register of reporting for business.  The agency believes that this will reduce the business costs associated with the confusing reporting mechanism.  The main problem of the Ministry of Economic Development considers the excessive amount of data that needs to be submitted too often and in different departments.  Worse, reporting requirements are constantly changing.  We are talking about thousands of reporting forms that reflect the requirements set out in more than 800 legislative acts. <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  According to the Ministry of Economic Development, the preparation of reports takes 6.2 billion hours during the year.  The agency plans to reduce these figures: in 2017 - by 6%, in 2018‚Äì2020 - by 5% annually.  If this happens, companies will spend 1.2 billion hours less on completing reports. <br><br>  According to the authors of the project, the unified register is an information portal where companies can find the necessary information for reporting, templates and forms.  It should also indicate the departments to which you want to send data, frequency, terms and methods of delivery.  The Ministry of Economic Development plans to reduce redundant and duplicate reporting, and with it the volume of necessary data.  The department plans to develop guidelines at the end of 2016.

      The creation of an information system for maintaining a single register of reporting, a reporting portal, and conducting research on optimizing reporting forms and examining applications for including forms in the register of the Ministry of Economic Development proposes to allocate 1.5 billion rubles.  This amount, according to the plan department, can be issued in parts in 2016-2020. <br><br>  It‚Äôs difficult to estimate this amount without analyzing the registry‚Äôs technical assignment, but it clearly needs to be more than a list of documents and forms, says Alexander Varvarin, vice president of corporate relations and legal support of the Russian Union of Industrialists and Entrepreneurs.  Perhaps we should talk about a tool that will allow filling in reports online and recording its receipt by government agencies, he suggests. <br><br>  ‚ÄúIn Russia, the problem with excessive reporting is several times sharper than in other jurisdictions, filling out reports can eat up to a quarter of the working time,‚Äù says Vladislav Korochkin, the first vice-president of Support of Russia. <br><br>  Now the concept is under discussion, RBC was <a href="http://top.rbc.ru/economics/13/08/2015/55ca14989a794725aa58a346">told by a</a> representative of the Ministry of Economic Development.  According to him, the ministry plans to submit a document to the government in September-October 2015. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/293638/">https://habr.com/ru/post/293638/</a></p>
