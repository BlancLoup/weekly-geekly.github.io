As is known, there is no regulation for this sphere yet, since the draft law on digital financial assets was headed by deputies headed by the chairman of the State Duma Committee on the Financial Market, Anatoly Aksakov, only in early March.  In May, he was adopted by the State Duma in the first reading. <br><br>  At the same time, nothing was said about mining taxation in this document.  Now the servants of the people decided to clarify this point.  ‚ÄúThere is such a type of business (mining - Ed.), People earn - many earn good money!  - accordingly, must pay taxes.  ‚ÄúAnd in order to bring them under taxation, we must define this type of business, and we decided to define mining,‚Äù said Aksakov.  He also announced that the deputies are planning to remove the words "cryptocurrency" and "tokens" from the bill. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  In the version of the bill that passed the first reading, mining is defined as an activity that is aimed at creating cryptocurrencies.  It is recognized as an entrepreneurial type of activity if, within three months, the miner - an individual entrepreneur or a legal entity exceeds the electricity limits set by the government.

      Individual miners are required to register as a PI, Aksakov reported.  Otherwise, they will be held accountable for illegal entrepreneurship. <br><br>  As for the regulation of the activity of miners, at the beginning of the year the Ministry of Communications and Mass Media was concerned about them.  The concept of mining regulation was developed, according to which the consumption of electricity and Internet traffic of registered miners should be monitored.  This is required in order to calculate how much cryptocurrency managed to get the "digital miner".  In addition, one of the provisions of the concept proposed to oblige miners to declare their digital income on a specialized crypto-exchange. <br><br>  At the end of August, it <a href="https://habr.com/post/421767/">was</a> also <a href="https://habr.com/post/421767/">reported</a> that representatives of the Russian blockchain market offered the government to endow individuals who mine cryptocurrency with self-employed status.  The authors of the initiative believe that this allows the cryptocurrency market in Russia to be removed from the shadows.  Then it was assumed that miners will be given the opportunity to enter the legislative sphere due to the minimum tax rate - 3-5% instead of 13%. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/425513/">https://habr.com/ru/post/425513/</a></p>
