This phrase is really fair, and most importantly relevant to the holidays.  I want to relax to the full, not paying attention to various household trifles.  An inconvenient suitcase, problems with luggage, the inability to relax on the road - all this, unfortunately, is familiar to almost every traveler. <br><br>  If you approach the issue responsibly, then some of the problems can be solved even before going outside your apartment.  Over the past few years, various companies have created a lot of things that can be useful not only for geeks.  Today in the selection is such things. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h3>  <a href="http://madrobots.ru/p/bluesmart/%3Futm_source%3Dgeektimes.ru%26utm_medium%3Dpr%26utm_campaign%3Dotpusk">Bluesmart Suitcase</a> </h3><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/VJnvx7IhAmk" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>

      The history of the Bluesmart suitcase began in 2014, when its creators launched a campaign on <a href="https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/bluesmart-world-s-first-smart-connected-carry-on">IndieGoGO</a> and in just one month collected $ 2,261,662 (!).  The BBC called it "the iPhone among the suitcases."  Bluesmart finally got to Russia. <br><br>  The suitcase has the full right to be called ‚Äúsmart‚Äù, it is equipped with many useful trifles that can be appreciated on any trip or journey.  The point here is not so much in design, but in functionality. <br><br>  Bluesmart is equipped with two USB ports from which you can charge your devices (capacity 10,400 mAh).  It has a touch weight sensor that allows you to find out the weight of the baggage without any effort.  This function should be appreciated by air travelers, each extra kilogram for which can result in large expenditures. <br><br>  The suitcase lock is controlled remotely, it is blocked if the phone with the pre-installed application is removed for a certain distance.  It also has a 3G / GPS-navigator, thanks to which the user can always be aware of exactly where his luggage is located. <br><br>  The ergonomics of Bluesmart is also at the height, the suitcase is quite spacious inside, you can put a lot of luggage there.  As for the application, it supports iOS and Android.  Connection is made via Bluetooth. <br><br><h3>  MK3 from R2GEAR </h3><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/247/d3a/6fa/247d3a6fa62297da965c28d75febe44e.jpg"><br><br>  Gadget MK3 is a new development from the company R2GEAR, which has tried to make the most versatile device for travelers.  Here, the functions of a smartphone, radio beacon, wireless speaker, LED flashlight and stylus are connected. <br><br>  The device case is protected from water according to the IP67 standard and is not at all afraid of external influences.  If the emergency button is pressed, the device starts sending text messages with the coordinates of the victim.  Mailing is carried out on pre-listed contacts. <br><br>  The brightness of the flashlight - 150 lumens, the battery lasts about a day of work of such a flashlight.  Well, the built-in stylus for displays will help you use your phone or tablet in the event that your hands are frozen. <br><br><h3>  <a href="http://madrobots.ru/p/xiaomi-mi-power-bank-2-20000/%3Futm_source%3Dgeektimes.ru%26utm_medium%3Dpr%26utm_campaign%3Dotpusk">External battery Xiaomi Mi Power Bank 2 20 000 mAh</a> </h3><br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/eB4FZLty3q8" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br>  Even if there is a suitcase with which you can charge your devices, the external battery still does not hurt.  The company Xiaomi not so long ago released the second version of its capacious 20,000 mAh battery.  With it, an iPhone 7 battery, for example, can be charged more than 7 times. <br><br>  This battery is approved by regulators, so that it can be safely carried on board the aircraft.  Actually, this is just an external battery, so there is nothing special to paint here.  The only thing is that the battery is equipped with two USB ports at once, which allows you to charge several devices at the same time.  The maximum output voltage and current is 5.1V / 3.6A.  The battery is protected from short circuit, so you can charge your devices with it without any problems. <br><br><h3>  Cori Traveler Pillow </h3><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/236/f7f/504/236f7f5043599a77e46c802c423f439e.jpg"><br><br>  Cori Traveler - a comfortable pillow with a bunch of features, the money for the production of which is collected on <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1351094974/worlds-first-modular-travel-pillow-cori-traveller">Kickstarter</a> (only a few days left before the end of the campaign).  Developers from Singapore have achieved that in the folded state, this pillow is only 12 cm in diameter.  It is placed on the palm.  There is no electronics, but it is not needed here. <br><br>  The Cori Traveler pillow consists of a long pillow, a belt and a short pillow.  Thanks to all these elements, it can be fixed as you like.  It will be useful in the bus, the train and the car will not be superfluous. <br><br><h3>  <a href="http://madrobots.ru/p/bivan-2-0/%3Futm_source%3Dgeektimes.ru%26utm_medium%3Dpr%26utm_campaign%3Dotpusk">Bevan 2.0</a> </h3><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/347/71c/886/34771c8864ea4d339d782dc54fb16efa.jpg"><br><br>  This is an inflatable sofa with which you can relax anywhere and everywhere.  A beach, an apartment, a clearing in the forest, or even an airport - the rest has become publicly available.  The second version of Bevan is flatter, which means more stable.  Since Bevan is our own development, it cost us nothing to take and change its design, to make it as convenient as possible (in total, about 20 Bevanov models were created and tested during production). <br><br>  In the second version, we added a pillow and a membrane, which makes it possible to sleep face down.  The fabric is impregnated with water-repellent impregnation.  It even has fixtures for pegs and for lighting. <br><br>  The pump, by the way, is also not needed, so one problem is less.  To inflate this sofa, you need only a few strokes, the whole process will take no more than 30 seconds (we marked).  When folded, Bevan 2.0 is very small and light (1.5 kg), it can be transported without any problems, for this purpose a convenient shoulder bag is included.  Air inflatable sofa holds about 12 hours. <br><br><h3>  Walkie Talker GoTenna </h3><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/c64/4c8/7c8/c644c87c8eedd347e0124e5f3566f133.jpg"><br>  This device looks like a regular USB flash drive.  In fact, this is a walkie-talkie that allows travelers who have wandered through a forest or other location to communicate.  To work, you just need to connect the radio over the wireless network to the smartphones of all participants in the trip. <br><br>  And then even without communication, you can communicate in the messenger, share information, however, the range of the device is not very large - only 5 kilometers. <br><br><h3>  <a href="http://madrobots.ru/p/xd-design-bobby-compact/%3Futm_source%3Dgeektimes.ru%26utm_medium%3Dpr%26utm_campaign%3Dotpusk">Backpack XD Design Bobby Compact</a> </h3><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/GlOvmyx1UqY" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  The Bobby Compact is a small city backpack, but its purpose is to hold the most valuable one.  This is a laptop, phone, gadgets, wallet.  For a hike, it is hardly worth using, but for a trip to rest, completely.  The fact that the backpack is designed with the thought of the safety of things owner.  Up to half a million pickpockets happen to the world every year, so no one is immune from this. <br><br>  XD Design Bobby Compact is protected from the hands of outsiders - for example, the zipper of the main section is hidden under a fabric bend.  From the outside it seems that this backpack has no zipper at all. <br><br>  You can open it at different angles, as is convenient for the user.  The material is multi-layered; it is made to protect from being crushed and trying to cut the material.  In addition, the material is completely waterproof, so that the water spray for the backpack is not a hindrance.  If you wish, you can protect the backpack additionally with a waterproof cover. <br><br>  Inside, you can comfortably accommodate a laptop and tablet.  The size of the laptop that fits here is a maximum of 14 inches.  In Bobby Compact there is a special USB port (there is a wire inside the backpack), so when you connect an external battery, the owner gets a universal charging station. <br><br>  On the back of the backpack is a pocket with a zipper, where you can hide the phone, keys and important documents. <br><br><h3>  <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B012TL0DWM/">Universal PowerCube ReWireable Charger</a> </h3><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/577/01c/ea3/57701cea305480a6b8a2868fc61c45a1.png"><br>  If you are going to travel to different countries, then it is worth remembering that a number of states have electrical standards for electrical appliance connectors.  And to find the right adapter, arriving late at night in any country, it is very difficult. <br><br>  In this situation, the PowerCube ReWireable device may be useful.  It gives you the opportunity to charge your phone, laptop or tablet in any country in the world.  Of course, if there is electricity. <br><br><h3>  <a href="http://madrobots.ru/p/oblozhka-dlya-dokumentov-zavtra/%3Futm_source%3Dgeektimes.ru%26utm_medium%3Dpr%26utm_campaign%3Dotpusk">Zavtra Passport Cover</a> </h3><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/EGMLKB9TiSU" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br>  The Zavtra document cover, like Bevan, is our own design.  It allows you to place your passport, law, bank / discount cards and most importantly - the boarding pass for the long-awaited flight. <br><br>  Everything is quite simple here, but at the same time, and convenient.  The cover is made of genuine leather and calmly withstands the test of time.  With such a cover no travel is scary. <br><br><h3>  <a href="http://madrobots.ru/p/fidget-cube/%3Futm_source%3Dgeektimes.ru%26utm_medium%3Dpr%26utm_campaign%3Dotpusk">Anti-stress cube Fidget Cube</a> </h3><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/rbETXxZZ0aM" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br>  We have already written about this cool dice, it is an occupation for the hands, which will not be boring anywhere.  Fidget Cube will allow you to relax at a meeting or just to occupy yourself with something during an agonizing wait. <br><br>  On each face of the cube there are various buttons, wheels, twists.  There is a clicker, switches and other things, to which the fingers stretch.  In order not to interfere with work colleagues, the clicking switches are made silent or even soundless, so this cube will not affect the nerves of the neighbors. <br><br>  Of course, there are a lot of good and different gadgets for rest, there are many more of them than can accommodate the volume of the article.  To do without them, in principle, it is possible.  But if you can make the way to the cherished place to rest or the rest itself is better, why not?  By the way, if you found something useful on the road / vacation / business trip, write in the comments, we all, I think, will be interested. <br><br><hr><br> <a href="http://madrobots.ru/%3Futm_source%3Dgeektimes.ru%26utm_medium%3Dpr%26utm_campaign%3Dotpusk"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/d29/4c3/07d/d294c307dde04335ac3f425e73b36a7a.gif"></a> <br> <a href="http://madrobots.ru/about/mails/%3Futm_source%3Dgeektimes.ru%26utm_medium%3Dpr%26utm_campaign%3Dotpusk"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/7fa/417/fe3/7fa417fe3d464fa5aa186b1ab30da53a.gif"></a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/405491/">https://habr.com/ru/post/405491/</a></p>
