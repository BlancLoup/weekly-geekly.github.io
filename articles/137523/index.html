The BrandMaker head office in Germany has a huge baggage of such information, but it relates exclusively to the company's European customers, and in Russia it is of little use.  Europe - Europe, but customers want to make sure that the program will be just as effective in Russian realities. <br><br>  In order to build up the required amount of this data, BrandMaker-Russia decided to provide customers with the opportunity to test the product before purchase, while paying for only the operational work of deploying and administering the system.  One of the conditions for such cooperation is that during testing, users of the system independently evaluate changes in business processes, saving time and financial resources.  It is important for us that this analysis takes place exactly on the client's side - this, of course, makes its results more weighty when making a final decision.

      Today I want to present the results of one of these studies. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  So, the input data: <br>  ‚Ä¢ client: medium-sized bank with a federal network (represented in all major cities of the Russian Federation) <br>  ‚Ä¢ users involved in testing the system - 50 <br>  ‚Ä¢ beginning of testing - October 2011. <br>  ‚Ä¢ system configuration: started with the <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/BrandMaker/blog/129915/">Media Resources</a> module; starting from February, it is planned to connect the <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/BrandMaker/blog/129243/">Web-to-Print</a> module. <br>  ‚Ä¢ at the head office of the bank there is a staff designer who performs the bulk of the work on the development and customization of design. <br><br>  At the end of the year, the intermediate results of the implementation of the ‚ÄúCopper Resources‚Äù were summarized.  The essence of the analysis was to determine the time spent on key workflows of marketing departments.  Estimated duration of these processes before and after module implementation.  By itself, the document turned out to be quite voluminous, so below I will cite only the most basic indicators. <br><br>  During the analysis, the processes related to the development of promotional materials for bank products / services were mainly considered.  In total, bank employees have identified seven major processes.  For each of them, the total duration and exact time spent in person / hours were estimated, and comments were given on typical problems. <br><br>  The final time-saving data is presented in the summary table. <br><br>  Calculations of time spent by one employee of the Head Office Advertising Department when working with advertising layouts (at the rate of 5 layouts within 1 month). <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/5d6/699/fc0/5d6699fc08a325526254f41d34b9792b.jpg"><br><br>  The results were much better than we expected, and this puzzled us a little.  During product presentations, we usually talk about reducing time costs by an average of 60% - in accordance with the practice of German colleagues.  In this case, apparently, the matter is in a high initial level of time loss for all these processes.  And this, according to our estimates, is a good example for most Russian companies. <br><br>  <b>What saves time?</b> <br><br>  <b>It was</b> <br>  Most of the time lost was found at the stages of sending layouts and adapting them locally.  Due to the large volume of files, it is impossible to send them by e-mail, so you have to use file sharing. <br><br>  Disadvantages: <br>  ‚Ä¢ The limited "lifetime" of the file (usually no more than a month). <br>  ‚Ä¢ You can find it only by direct link. <br>  ‚Ä¢ Lack of preview function. <br><br>  Specifically, this client‚Äôs situation is aggravated by the fact that, for security reasons, the majority of computers operate on the local network, without Internet access, and there are restrictions on the speed of traffic.  Quite typical of the banking sector.  Because of this, all participants in the process in the chain ‚Äúthe designer - the head office of the bank - the regional offices of the bank - the local printing houses‚Äù try to be safe and ‚Äújust in case‚Äù download all the working files each to their computer.  And not only the final agreed options, but also a bunch of unnecessary files and then (intermediate and alternative options, previews, etc.).  As a result, the abundance of different versions of the file stored on computers of different users then complicates the search for the current version.  Especially if it is needed not immediately, but after some time.  Here, of course, it all depends on how each individual employee maintains order in their files.  "The human factor" in the classical form. <br><br>  <b>It became</b> <br>  The last couple of months, after the introduction of BrandMaker, the regular designer loads the layout directly into the Media Resources module, and there all the subsequent work with it is already underway - coordination, adaptation, etc.  It is possible to give a direct link to download a third-party user - for example, to the printing house.  In order to view the file, you do not need to upload it to your computer - viewing is carried out directly in the system using a regular browser.  Thus, the need to send and download the file is no longer completely.  (The only instance that will need to be used to pump the layout out of the system is the printing house itself, if we are talking about printing layouts).  Options adapted for different branches, the designer also puts in the general access.  After the implementation of Web-to-Print, the functions of adapting layouts will be removed from the designer altogether - field managers will themselves work with the ready-made template, substituting their data into it. <br><br>  In February 2012, the bank plans to test two more cases on BrandMaker application: organize a federal system for monitoring competitors' activity based on Media Resources, and a mechanism for generating personalized letters based on Web-to-Print.  What will come out of this is sure to tell. <br><br>  Thanks for attention! </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/137523/">https://habr.com/ru/post/137523/</a></p>
