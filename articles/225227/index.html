      The last year was very tense and eventful ... But, everything is in order. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  <i><b>1. Automated control system for electrical equipment of the power plant of its own needs.</b></i> <br>  Signal volume: 5500 I / O points <br><br>  <a href="http://www.scadaplus.ru/vnedreniya/asu_esn1/">Link to project details</a> <br><br>  In one of the publications already briefly touched on this project.  Its feature was the fact that it was from him that a subsystem of automatic generation of the project information base appeared on my basis based on structured tabular data from the TK (mainly the tables of signals, or lists of parameters). <br>  The subsystem has proved itself very much more than once in subsequent implementations, and has been greatly refined to provide flexibility for adapting to any formats of TK documents that the developer receives as input to the project. <br><br>  The system has been successfully operating for the 2nd year at the facility.  Last year, it was successfully put into commercial operation. <br><br>  <i><b>2. ACS Energy supply technological object</b></i> <br>  Signal volume: 8500 I / O points <br><br>  <a href="http://www.scadaplus.ru/vnedreniya/asue3/">Link to project details</a> <br><br>  This project is probably the only one of all implementations that has passed a very serious test of a very serious commission.  I am even a little proud of such a result, because before me such a commission with a similar decision could only be successfully passed by two companies: Siemens and Schneider, and now here I am.  Modestly so ... <br><br>  Thanks to this implementation, a lot of system functions were worked out, and a global optimization of the source code was carried out in order to increase the speed of graphics, memory allocation, as well as work with external interfaces for exchanging data via logical protocols. <br><br>  <i><b>3. ACS Energy Supply Gas Pumping Station</b></i> <br>  Signal volume: 3000 I / O points <br><br>  <a href="http://www.scadaplus.ru/vnedreniya/asue2/">Link to project details</a> <br><br>  A very similar project to the previous implementation.  In principle, it was made with an eye to it and on the successful results of the previous implementation. <br>  It‚Äôs just that the situation turned out to be banal as always: the brand scud, which was originally used at this facility, after a year of dancing with it was rejected by the commission at the stage of attempting to put it into trial operation because it almost 50% does not meet the requirements of the industry.  After a heap of serious meetings on the question ‚Äúwhat to do?‚Äù, They finally came to me with the phrase ‚ÄúRoma, help me out!‚Äù ... In general, one of my engineers for 3 months at the facility could develop and run this project from scratch, as well as pass his trial operation in general without a single observation of the commission.  Alone ... This year (after a year of work in trial operation), the system has already been commissioned by the commission for commercial operation, and again without a single remark.  It was very significant, especially in comparison with the results in terms and quality, which had previously been shown by a ‚Äúserious‚Äù brand ... <br><br>  <i><b>4. ACS of Gas Piston Power Plant (2 MW)</b></i> <br>  Signal volume: 1500 I / O points <br><br>  <a href="http://www.scadaplus.ru/vnedreniya/asu_rgpeu2/">Link to project details</a> <br><br>  Initially, this project was planned to do on InTouch, because the engineers had previously worked on this scud.  However, having assessed the scope of work and deadlines, it was not possible to keep within the allotted period.  The evaluation of the development in InTouch on the terms was at least 2 months of work, and it was necessary to do it urgently in 1 month maximum.  I argued that in my scud, this project can be developed much faster than even one month, thanks to the built-in function of automatically generating the project information base for the TK.  At first they didn‚Äôt believe me - so I had to make a video where, by the example of the first ten signals from the TK, it was clearly shown how it looks.  After the video was viewed, the work began with the phrase ‚ÄúImpressive‚Äù for engineers. <br>  Only two engineers (one on the graph and the other on the project information structure) coped with the task in the scape they first saw for the first time, in just 20 days (after three weeks of development there was a ready-made full-featured prototype of the project for testing at the test site). <br>  Now I am writing these deadlines, and behind my back there is a discussion on the phone of work on the Polish People's Republic at this site with this project.  I hope that it will soon be put into trial operation. <br><br>  <i><b>5. SAU of Gas Turbine Unit (1.5 MW)</b></i> <br>  Signal volume: 1500 I / O points <br><br>  <a href="http://www.scadaplus.ru/vnedreniya/sau_gta1/">Link to project details</a> <br><br>  This project appeared as a result of the exhibition, which was held in the spring of 2013, where the St. Petersburg company invited me to its stand.  In one of the publications I have already covered this event.  Representatives of a company that develops ACS automation systems for gas turbine units for auxiliary power stations approached me on the stand.  According to their technical director, they have already tried many Western brands for this implementation, but all of them are not competitive due to the high cost of software.  Therefore, they decided to try to execute this project on my scale.  My prices are quite satisfied.  Now we are jointly finalizing the project before carrying out the commissioning work at the site.  All the algorithms and control logic of the unit are executed in the controller at the lower level, which works under the control of the CoDeSys system, my scada works on the AWS and is essentially a pure HMI for this solution.  There are no serious control algorithms - only registration, processing (archiving and event logging), management and graphics. <br><br>  So, a serious start has been made on serious implementations, and the system has ‚Äúvery matured‚Äù on many issues.  Sometimes, when I demonstrate its capabilities to people who are engaged in automation, I hear the same phrase in a review, which has become almost a common noun for this kind of action: ‚ÄúWe didn‚Äôt even think that everything was so serious ...‚Äù <br><br>  In addition to these implementations, there are a number of small system implementations that have been performed by other developers, if interested - a complete list and detailed information can be found <a href="http://www.scadaplus.ru/vnedreniya/">here</a> . <br><br>  Looking back and looking forward with confidence, I have already decided for myself that the next version of my system is coming up, which I will do already taking into account the experience of the previous one, as well as laying new technologies in order to get a more competitive product.  Already last year, he began to make some prototypes of individual editors, in which he began to run around these technologies and try new ideas.  However, having thought about the volumes, I decided that once again I could pull this volume alone, but this would not be the right coat.  From the beginning of this year, I decided to turn to my friends (former colleagues), who have now organized their own IT company.  They have a ready-made platform in the form of a legal entity, as well as the necessary recruitment of specialists who are needed at least to begin the implementation of these development works, and I have intellectual baggage in the form of a ready-made system that is already working, and I must say, quite successfully. <br>  We decided that it now makes sense to bring my current version to a commercial product and start selling, as well as develop a direction on system integration (development of turnkey solutions) based on it.  This will give an influx of funding in order to be able to start work on the development of a new version of the system, based on those ideas that have already been formed, and also tested in prototypes. <br>  Therefore, at the current stage, I begin to try on the role of the system architect, as well as the developer of final projects based on it.  I now completely hand over the reins of development and programming to a professional programmer, who is not self-taught, but a certified engineer in this field.  It is he who will now form the development team and lead them and the development process.  I must say that in the process of working on the current version, he helped me a lot with the subtleties of programming. <br>  So, gradually, we will form a professional solution from homemade products and bring it to the market ... By the way, this year we bought a stand at the exhibition on industrial automation PTA-2014, which will be held in the fall at the Expocenter in Moscow, where we plan to present Our joint solution for the current version in the form of a finished commercial product.  Follow the news and welcome to our booth! <br><br></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/225227/">https://habr.com/ru/post/225227/</a></p>
