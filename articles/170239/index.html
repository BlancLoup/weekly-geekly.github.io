We would like to tell you a lot of interesting things, but for now we will tell you about how the conference went and why <a href="http://gamersweb.ru/">we are</a> very unhappy. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  It all started with the fact that Sony, according to tradition, showed a beautiful video that was cutting games from San Andreas to Killzone 3. The video featured the slogan: "Imagination is the only weapon in the fight against reality." <br>  Andrew House appeared on the scene, telling us about the infrastructure and future plans.  Everything should be one piece - software, hardware, services, devices, tablets, phones and PS Vita.  After that, House said two words: "PlayStation 4".  Shouts, ovations, champagne! <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/384/09e/9b1/38409e9b1757efa2cca4e8b88aa9ec80.jpeg">

      <br>
      Then Mark Zernie was invited to the stage, who said that the development of the console began almost immediately after the PlayStation 3 entered the market.  He also said that the PlayStation 4 is a platform from game developers for game developers.  He added that Sony is very proud of Cell and said that their new architecture console will look like a PC.  The console will have 8 gigabytes of RAM.  Rumors were true. <br><br>  And we are shown DualShock 4!  The updated form, the touchpad, the Share button, the advanced rumble, the headset jack, the backlight for identifying players and the built-in Move are all DualShock 4. Then we were shown the PlayStation Eye, which is able to record video and monitor your gamepad. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/f5b/cb8/1db/f5bcb81dbd32eb95fbe31c4f1122829c.jpeg"><br><br>  Suddenly, we are starting to show the Unreal Ungine 4 engine in real time and the ‚Äúgame‚Äù Knack.  Knack is a new ‚Äúgame‚Äù, which is a platformer, about a robot that is going to resist the invaders, who, too, are robots.  To be honest, it would be better to show nothing than that. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/q59tHyhDMkI%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,1500008,15700002,15700022,15700186,15700191,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhguaMkGiXmmbyU4PPLkuBecSoEGQg" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  Now you can turn off the console at any time, and the next time you start it, it will turn you on to the game from the same place where you finished.  Here they are, technology, innovation.  Also, we were shown an updated PlayStation Store interface for the PlayStation 4: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/042/03c/5c5/04203c5c5631448757f0f65e28e06d8b.jpeg"><br><br>  Now you can record videos from the games, watch your friends playing live.  Sony wants to put the videos on a par with screenshots.  Social abilities of the console will be closely associated with smartphones and tablets.  Now you do not need to wait for the download of the digital version.  You will be able to play immediately after purchase, and the game will continue to load. <br>  Gaikai executive Dave Perry stepped on the scene.  He said that Gaikai was integrated into the PlayStation Store.  Now there will be no demos of games, you can try the game directly from the store.  Social networks a la Ustream and Facebook will be connected to the network service of the console.  Perry said they create the most powerful social network in the world.  The most important role will be played by the ‚ÄúShare‚Äù button, which is able to show the world, friends, neighbor, dog everything you want.  You can ask advice from a friend or play with him.  In the console, there will be a ‚Äúremote play‚Äù function, which explains why Sony came up with the Vita.  Now absolutely any game can be transferred to a portable console and continue with the passage already sitting, for example, in the restroom.  By the way, with the help of Gaikai, we will be able to launch games from the previous three consoles on the PlayStation 4. Alas, we didn‚Äôt really understand how it will be implemented not in words. <br>  Then Sony turned on the video, where various developers spoke good words about the PlayStation 4. There were: Cage, Shafer, representatives of Ninja Theory and Naughty Dog.  A lot of attention was paid to the fact that now the game has gone beyond the living room.  Now the PlayStation will be both in the smartphone and in the tablet, and everywhere.  Sony captures the world, roughly speaking. <br>  Then Michael Denny from Sony Worldwide Studios appeared on the scene.  He said that nothing is more important than games.  Everyone patted.  And then came the director of Guerrilla Games, in order to announce Killzone: Shadow Fall.  Watch the debut gameplay video: <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/PkAk1GPOuhs%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,1500008,15700002,15700022,15700186,15700191,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhgG0M5j9xgp9dR4-ge1-MApKdxrWg" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  This is the first major announcement.  The video looks great.  The game has changed, it became brighter.  That's just what we showed, we could already see in Call of Duty.  Shooting, shouting, explosions ... They even screwed my free sight.  The game looks good, but only thanks to the artists. <br>  After the shooter, we decided to show the team races from Evolution Studios.  The game was named Driveclub.  You know what's the coolest?  The studio has been waiting for PlayStation 4 for ten years to release the game.  You can go crazy!  Briefly about the game: roads, competition, cars.  A lot of attention paid to first-person view.  The game will have an animation of fastening the seat belt!  No, you believe that?  Ten years! <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/Pv34shBiXhM%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,1500008,15700002,15700022,15700186,15700191,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhiMV7Ss2pCf-Rr4EMn7veZ3lPBYaw" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  What can surprise us after such a wonderful game?  Of course the new game from Sucker Punch.  Hello, inFamous: Second Son, glad to see.  The game is about people who have super powers. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/p5R0dWgSAJI%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,1500008,15700002,15700022,15700186,15700191,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhiyoPeCpOtv6N84VHvu2VLpA795pw" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  After an abundance of beautiful projects, Jonathan Blow stepped onto the stage, yes, yes, which Braid did.  And it was he who decided to show us the game!  New project Jonathan was named The Witness.  The game will be released only on the PlayStation 4, but also on the PC, but among the consoles no one else will get it.  Interesting fact: the game for about five years was only a PC project.  We were pleased with the first roller. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/ZSPCC6i2O0I%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,1500008,15700002,15700022,15700186,15700191,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhiBUEMFrwSuIkkYsRO4eh98CiZDEg" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  After David Cage came out and the first thing he said was the word "emotion."  Then he told about technology, and for some time he compared games with cinema.  No, he did not say anything about soap.  Quantic Dream prepared for us a demo version - the head of an elderly person.  The head looks like a good CGI.  It is high time. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/a8d/aa2/bd5/a8daa2bd555f08cb7a9a3941613a4576.jpeg">  " <br><br>  Then Media Molecule appeared on the screen with our creative.  We were told about the love of Move.  We were taught how to make statues using Move.  Then they showed a very strange concert, which was controlled by the players with the help of the controller.  I was very glad that blood did not flow from my eyes. <br>  After an extraordinary video on the scene, Yoshinori Ono appeared, his exit was accompanied by music from God of War.  He immediately said that there would be no Street Fighter today, after which he spoke about technology.  Panta Rhei is the new code name for the Capcom engine.  Then we decided to please the demo version of the project Deep Down, which was very similar to Dark Souls.  Let's just say the project is intriguing.  We advise to follow him. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/ysZ5NdoVP2Q%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,1500008,15700002,15700022,15700186,15700191,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhh58GJRkf8lzpuerdJcSL6vLYpcxA" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  Yoshihisa Hashimoto from Square Enix came to show his engine.  And here they include a demo version for us, which we successfully observed at E3.  They achieved tremendous success, because they were able to launch it on the PlayStation 4. Why did they show us the old video series?  Japanese.  We already thought that the new Final Fantasy, but no - we were told that it would be, only at E3.  Dammit! <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/UVX0OUO9ptU%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,1500008,15700002,15700022,15700186,15700191,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhg_uyUPS-Jqk4jN78U-Yf9U1Jd09Q" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  Drumroll!  Yves Giemo appeared on the stage, and immediately began to talk about Watch_Dogs.  The game was announced on the PlayStation 4, it is believed that it is not exclusive.  After the project leader stepped on the scene, who told a little bit more.  But the most important thing is the new video they prepared for us.  The game looks so cool that I'm ready to take the money right now, just tell me where.  The protagonist calmly walks through the autumn city, listens to a street musician, hacks an ATM.  Then chase, escape and shock.  We are shown parkour, hacks and shootouts.  Thanks to one press of a button, the main character stops the passage.  A little reminded Assassin's Creed, but still the game made this conference. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/-25hIpyBfT4%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,1500008,15700002,15700022,15700186,15700191,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhgvSnEzpQP1CrH5jW8wT83TXsPvLA" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  And those who certainly no one expected: Blizzard! <br>  We were told about the love of Sony and that they want to take over the world.  Then announced Diablo III for the PlayStation 3 and PlayStation 4. Why?  Blizzard  The very same game will show on PAX East.  But the return of Blizzard to the console is very intriguing. <br>  After appeared on the scene Activision.  Bungie, Destiny, announcement on the PlayStation 4. The main Activision games will be made for the PlayStation 4. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/ac7/8c1/8e9/ac78c18e94ab53bbac011510234c717f.jpeg"><br><br>  The completion of the event.  PlayStation 4 will be released later this year.  Thanks to everybody, you're free. <br>  One question is brewing: where is the console, @ # $%? <br><br>  Ps.  Meme on the topic of the day <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/87a/728/046/87a72804616d116c048604eb6b086053.jpeg"><br><br><hr><br>  On our <a href="http://gamersweb.ru/">site</a> you can find news, articles, videos and podcasts on gaming and IT topics!
