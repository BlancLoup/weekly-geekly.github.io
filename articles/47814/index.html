This is a subsidiary of “Mobile Payment” swallowed up the “Russian Billing”.  It really is true, “A1” - “super aggregator”, nothing more than a small child with child insults who decided to crawl out of the children's sandbox, on the Moscow Ring Road.

    <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  Naturally, “A1”, had the audacity to say that “MPBILL” is their own platform, that they wrote it with difficulty and then, that it had invested years of development to improve the system of organizing billing via SMS, of course, forgot to add an asterisk, “we sold it for pennies of the founders of Russian Billing ”. <br><br>  Everyone understands that this “MPBILL” was loved just as much as little billing people like, with a small number of clients <br><br>  Billing about which in the network just do not speak, and do not respect.  Ie, not fish is not meat, not sms online.  So, as a result of all the body movements, “raider divorce” from “RB” ala, capture yourself, the Great and Horrible Market Leader “A1”, alternative, alternative, was born.  Of course, the not yet restructured company “MPBILL” could only dream of such a position in the market, and naturally would never have achieved it in fair ways, if it had not created the Russian Billing receivable to its partners using a wave of crisis sentiment.  Many were worried that there would be no payment of arrears, as a result of the fact that A1 was shamelessly stealing money intended for Russian Billing.  Fortunately, these are not 90 years, it’s a pity that not all users (partners) are well legally savvy, it was possible to create a precedent, file a lawsuit and finally show who does this business.  And let them not dare to say, we are not paying our debts, but “RB” - this is not true !!!  These are your debts, and be so kind as to pay them on time, otherwise you will not avoid high-profile trials.  Maybe then you learn to respect those at whose expense you thrive. <br><br>  Now consider the policy, as they say, what is “A1” doing with key partners now?  - in a closed community of managers and owners of various partner programs, billing, there is a heated discussion, the subject of which is the delay in payments to legal partners.  I will not name brands of mobimir, but when I find out that “A1” delays payments to all companies (subaggregators), when the contracts are simply filled with absurd points, a bad opinion is formed, to survive at the expense of others, at least ugly, the same fate will befall. <br><br>  Let's continue: After “A1” appeared, in the face of the main technical “MPBILL”, something happened that should have happened - the platform could not withstand the sharp influx of 50% of all customers in this market.  The word appeared - “shaved”, a deliberate concealment of real statistics, and 10 companies renting short numbers from “A1” suffered because of this, of course, we understand that this is not a technical issue. <br><br>  Now, regarding a technical problem, Goliath stumbled, the Tower of Babel collapsed without being completed.  Along the way, suppressing small partners. <br><br>  “A1” tries to brazenly position itself as a reliable guarantor of SMS payments.  In the “A1” analogy, it is tied up on the simplest platform, which ranks last in the rating, the technical basis, just for retail, so-called.  For a little traffic.  I'm such a nonsense, I apologize for the expression I never saw the API was called - extended access to SMS handler.  This is something!  When on Goldphone all services are immediately visible, the full subscriber number, what kind of API can be.  They even know the decoding of this concept, and where it is used. <br><br>  <b>So to call “A1” reliable, at least, it’s just unprofessionalism and stupidity.</b> <br><br>  ... <br><br>  <b>Things that can not be called by their names.</b> <br><br>  Reading countless articles - “We are white, we are for a new business, there is no black competition” What kind of white business and transparent schemes can we talk about if prohibited content is sold.  How bored, uneducated wiseachers, poking articles and laws, in which there is no definition of what is “porn”.  Wake up, there is a definition for this, there are experts who can conduct examinations, and make expert opinions, and oh yeah !!!  There are precedents of administrative and criminal punishment, because there is an article on your heavy share. <br><br>  So what is a billing connecting “ADALT”.  Here the question now is not that illegal, although at this point someone’s comment will pop up: “There is demand, there is supply.” I will answer plainly, there is demand for heroin too, but often the offer then sits behind bars.  The question is, what kind of business is this?  - the answer is illegal, and the funny thing is - There is no law on sms billing. <br><br>  True, I hasten to congratulate, soon the Internet will touch it, but as practice shows, it will live in a new way, everything will be in a different form, and the desired meaning will not change. <br><br>  I do not blame this type of income, I simply do not have the right, this is a moral issue, and some intrinsic values, and from some side it may even be useful, for everyone it’s just a personal choice. <br><br>  I want to explain to “white businessmen”, let's keep silence together about gray advertising schemes, and only then will we beat ourselves to an honest chest when all the laws are followed.  Separate discussion is the illegal appropriation of billing "spam money", it is subject to harsh punishment by law.  And in the light of all these arguments there is a struggle for a white business.  In my opinion this is nothing more than ill-conceived PR.  But in the depths it’s just hypocrisy, earning it all my life, and now blaming it ... <br><br>  Full version on <a href="http://blog.antivgu.ru/krax-sms-monopolii/">blog.antivgu.ru/krax-sms-monopolii</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/47814/">https://habr.com/ru/post/47814/</a></p>
