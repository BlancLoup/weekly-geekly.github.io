  <section class="page js-page"><h1>About goals</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/5c4/0e4/823/5c40e482334d480fa3e01468b7887ee9.jpg" align="left">  Purpose.  We very often mention this word.  Or talking about goal-oriented people.  Or talk about the means, without mentioning the purpose.  Let's see what the goal is.  The goal is what needs to be achieved.  I use this simple definition for myself.  However, deceptive simplicity requires answering a few questions.  First, you need to clearly define whose goal it is: yours personally, the company where you work, a certain group of people, or perhaps humanity? <br><br>  Let's start with personal goals.  The next thing to be defined is what we want to achieve.  One sentence.  But how to give the correct definition?  The recipe is as follows - when the goal is achieved, you can definitely understand it.  In other words, the goal must be measurable.  For example: "I want to get rich."  Good definition?  Not.  Now you think the wealth of a million dollars.  When you have it, you will probably consider yourself a middle-income person, but not a rich man.  "I want a million dollars" - great.  In the pocket of a million - the goal is achieved. <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  However, it is very important to say frankly to oneself - ‚Äúyes, damn it, this is exactly what I want!‚Äù. <habracut>  If this is not the case, neither movement towards the goal nor its achievement will bring satisfaction.  This is another principle.  You must accept and share this goal.

      The next important concept is the term.  If we are not determined that we want to have a million dollars in 1, 3 or 5 years, we will constantly postpone our steps towards this goal.  When we clearly understand when we have a deadline, we look for options, we work.  But I do not recommend setting goals that are too distant - it may turn out that they are no longer interesting for you.  Month, year, five - maximum. <br><br>  The goal must be achievable.  This is no less important than the previous ones.  Set realistic goals.  Reaching them you get encouragement.  Unrealistic goals will drive you into anguish faster than the next deadline passes. <br><br>  Experienced readers have of course already understood that the above is a free and somewhat abbreviated interpretation of the <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/SMART">SMART</a> principle.  This mnemonic abbreviation allows for a quick revision of the target by five parameters: Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, Time-bound. <br><br><h1>  Personal experience </h1><br><br>  Unfortunately, I didn‚Äôt have enough sense to get to the above on my own, but a few years ago a business coach told me about SMART.  This was the starting point of a whole chain of changes in one‚Äôs own life, which led first to success in work and career, then to leaving the company, creating your own business and investing. <br><br>  Deeply imbued with the concept of SMART goals, I once decided to discuss our goals for the next year with my wife.  It took us all the New Year holidays.  We discussed the second child, the new car, the house in the suburbs, and our own business.  And the only thing we both shared and accepted was one million rubles.  Million rubles of free money in a year. <br><br>  We could not agree in advance on what to spend it, but decided that it would be nice to have it, and there it was already up to them.  A year later, we achieved this, and this money allowed me to leave hired work and open my first business after a while.  But that's another story. <br><br><h1>  Good and bad goals </h1><br><br>  I recently told my old friend this story, and a dispute arose that money cannot be the goal.  And I suspect that I didn‚Äôt have enough eloquence to convey my thought to the interlocutor.  But indeed, in many sources, money is referred to as an unsuccessful or frankly bad goal.  Moreover, I could not remember the objective arguments against money.  Personal experience tells me the opposite - the goal is very clear, you can always identify the achievable amount, and this goal really gives you a benefit or at least some pleasure. <br><br>  If you are now thinking about how it would be great to create your own business, and you need to take the right first step, think about starting with money.  In any case, they will be useful to you.  And such a step will be clear and understandable. <br><br>  Looking further, I am inclined to think that the goal does not require proof and explanation at all.  If you like this goal and you are going to achieve it - you should not listen to anyone.  And be prepared that many skeptics will explain to you clearly why you shouldn't do this.  Well, if you choose the path to the goal - move.  This is your goal and you decide.  Even if you are going to fly to the moon or die on Mars. <div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">but</b> <div class="spoiler_text">  Ps.  This applies only to personal goals, of course.  If you decide to share your goal with someone else (wife, friends, company, state) - all these people should share it just like you.  Convincing all of these people can be extremely difficult.  Therefore, think twice whether to dedicate them all to it, or if you can somehow draw it to your side.  However, group goals are already beyond the scope of this article. </div></div></habracut></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/247557/">https://habr.com/ru/post/247557/</a></p>
