  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Orthodox sites will not participate in the "Runet Awards 2007"</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  The results of the ‚ÄúPopular vote‚Äù at last year‚Äôs ‚Äú <a href="http://www.premiaruneta.ru/">Runet Award</a> ‚Äù, as many remember, quite clearly showed the very weak stability of the vote counting system.  At <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blog/columns/6323.html">that</a> time, 5 websites of Orthodox subjects and 4 online gaming sites <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blog/columns/6323.html">were</a> among the top ten leaders, whose users purposefully and blatantly voted for their favorite projects over and over again. <br><br>  Despite the uproar in the press and the <a href="http://forum.mozilla-russia.org/viewtopic.php%3Fid%3D14187%26p%3D1">open letter of the</a> administrators of the winning sites, in which they questioned any prestige of victory in such a poorly organized contest, the ‚ÄúPeople‚Äôs Voting‚Äù Prize is still, in their opinion, almost defenseless stubborn masses of online activists. <br><br>  The reaction to the fact that the requests and advice of last year‚Äôs participants addressed to the organizers were ‚Äúignored‚Äù was a <a href="http://www.mrezha.ru/action/letter2007.php">new open letter</a> from the founders of Orthodox websites, in which they declared their refusal to participate in the ‚ÄúPopular Vote‚Äù. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  The head of the press service of the coordinator of the work of the Expert Council of the Award - the Regional Public Center for Internet Technologies ( <a href="http://www.rocit.ru/">ROCIT</a> ) - Olga Podlesnaya, whom I asked to comment on this event, said that everyone has the right to refuse to vote.  According to her, ‚Äúthe rules for conducting online voting were published on the website for a long time‚Äù and everyone could read them if they paid more attention to this.  On the technical side, the voting concept has been reworked.  Now, for your favorite sites, without limiting their number, anyone can vote once a day (12 hours earlier).  However, as before, the verification of the voter is carried out only by IP, without the use of identification by e-mail or in any other way.  Also, the total time during which the voting is held was not reduced, since this step ‚Äúdid not seem reasonable‚Äù to the organizers.

      SMS voting has been canceled.  Few people understood his appointment last year, mainly due to the fact that the final statistics did not indicate the number of votes cast through short messages.  This time over this head will not have to break. <br><br>  Claims to the quality of moderation, which, according to words from an open letter of Orthodox activists, allows for ‚Äúadult‚Äù sites to vote, Olga also rejected and, for clarity, one of the sites that was recently denied registration was given as an example.  I can say that the example was extremely vivid. <br><br>  In general, the opponents of the "Popular vote" in its current form is unlikely to be able to convince something.  Moreover, nobody especially tries to persuade them.  Who is right, as always, will show the time and the final statistics, which will be published in late November. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/14980/">https://habr.com/ru/post/14980/</a></p>
