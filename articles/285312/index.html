  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Russia. Bend or move?</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  When I was small, I thought: ‚ÄúWhy do the inhabitants of the tundra tolerate such cold weather, short days and long nights, and not move to the sea, warmth?‚Äù Years passed, I realized why I myself, living in the taiga, do not move to the south - I like it here, and so it is easier. <br>  I apologize, this is my second article for this week, not quite related to the topic of Habr.  But I do not dare to remain silent. <br>  All of us at meetings with friends share our discontent, the Internet is teeming with complaints and complaints, articles of the indignant regularly meet on the website.  It seems that the whole country is indignant.  People are unhappy with different things: <a href="">one</a> , <a href="http://www.livejournal.ru/themes/id/16028">two</a> , <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/strange_things/61509/">three,.</a>  <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/study/77623/">.</a>  <a href="http://old.comstol.ru/Mgd/2008/118.html">.</a>  <a href="http://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%259E%25D0%25B1%25D1%2589%25D0%25B5%25D1%2581%25D1%2582%25D0%25B2%25D0%25BE_%25D0%25BF%25D0%25BE%25D1%2582%25D1%2580%25D0%25B5%25D0%25B1%25D0%25BB%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B8%25D1%258F">.</a>  <a href="http://gigamir.net/pub/26936">.</a>  and <a href="http://www.google.ru/search%3Fhl%3Dru%26newwindow%3D1%26q%3D%25D0%25BF%25D1%2580%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B1%25D0%25BB%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BC%25D1%258B%2B%25D1%2580%25D0%25BE%25D1%2581%25D1%2581%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B8%26lr%3D%26aq%3Df%26oq%3D">so on.</a> And despite all this we endure.  We seem to be no longer able to get together and act all together against something.  But each of us can change something at least for ourselves - change the world around us or move ourselves geographically. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  So years have passed and my childish question now sounds like this: why are we all so disgruntled, not trying to go where everything is much better or change the environment?  I often think about it and understand that sooner or later I will become a specialist who can be in demand abroad as well as many here.  And I get up to my full height the question: is it worth it? <br>  A lot of nuances contains the search for an answer.  I wish where there are clean streets, where neat houses, where smooth roads, where good attitude to people, where there are no kickbacks (or at least not in such sizes), where I will live without thinking how to save this month enough to repair the car 94th year and a gift for his wife, and many more different "where."  But will there be such interesting people like here?  Will I become mine there, will I live in customs?  What feelings will arise in relation to Russia?  I would like to ask these questions to those habrovans who have moved abroad, of which I think there are quite a few.  Tell us what kind of people are there, what kind of world.  Do I need to go there?  What have you got there and what have you lost?  Is it difficult to find a job for an IT specialist, particularly in the telecommunications sector?  Most likely, it is not for me alone that all this is interesting. <br>  But questions that I would like to discuss with the Russian part of the community.  Will it be psychological difficulty for you to go to another country in search of personal peace of mind, leaving your colleagues, friends, relatives and many other smart people in Russia who should already try to improve their state while you support another country?  I am not an ardent patriot, but even for me this is a burning question. <br>  Another question: what does an artist need? <br>  It: <br><img src="http://img2.pict.com/1d/ce/f5/2188676/0/korely31350.jpg" alt="image"><br>  Or that? <br><img src="http://img2.pict.com/2e/ba/82/2188846/0/kottedzhb1730496900.jpg" alt="image"><br>  Maybe it is because of such a complicated life that we have so many interesting and smart people?  We have to contend with all the hardships, surround ourselves with an impenetrable shell of tolerance and indifference, which has its own developed world, and carefully choose a social circle.  We should not be limited to our specialization, but we need to know as much as possible (it‚Äôs a pity that I‚Äôm not talking about the majority of the population).  And what will happen abroad?  Sweet quiet life - will it destroy our beginning?  My friends left high-paying jobs for little-known companies, because they were getting bored, they didn‚Äôt want their brain to stagnate.  Will not our children smoothly atrophy there? <br>  And further.  I have always tried not to make distinctions between nations, but somehow it is not in itself that I, as a representative of the nation, will dissolve among other people with time. <br>  There is another question: how are friends and relatives?  But, everyone has his own answer to this question. <br>  So what?  Bend under our world and keep his backs or move away and not disturb others?  Or gather all the strength into a fist, prepare for a long, difficult and honest (!) Struggle and make a name for yourself in Russia, behave as you would like everyone to behave, but perhaps always be alone? </div>
