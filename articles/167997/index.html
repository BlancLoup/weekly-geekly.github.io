Comment was <br>  about something else, but that's exactly what got hooked.  Because it is this phrase briefly <br>  and capaciously describes the whole layer of work in freelancing and to some extent in IT, especially in <br>  areas where information technology is only a concomitant part <br>  business process.  This post is a free presentation of my experience and experience. <br>  my acquaintances: freelancers, programmers, system administrators who took <br>  participation in the work to which the capacious prefix thrash sticks. <br><br>  This narration is conducted solely from the perspective of an employee, <br>  so if you, as a customer, boss, manager, it seems that in this text <br>  such characters as customers, supervisors, managers are described one-sidedly and <br>  biased, this is done intentionally, and not by stupidity or omission. <a name="habracut"></a><br><br><br><h5>  Synopsis </h5><br>  If we talk about the original sources of trash (for the performer) in any field of application <br>  wage labor, everything rests on 3 pillars: low budget, unrealistic requirements, <br>  low mental or moral characteristics of the governing party.  Like three <br>  basic colors, these three circumstances can generate a whole palette of projects <br>  varying degrees and shades of trash.  On this, perhaps, it would be possible <br>  stop, but wounded collective pride requires details.

      Of course, there are people to whom the writing below will seem ridiculous and incredible, and <br>  we would like to have such a majority.  There will be many people who, remembering <br>  similar episodes from the origins of his career, only nostalgic grin. <br><br><br><h5>  Places </h5><br>  Nowhere can you be insured against being in a situation where you <br>  painfully feel like an idiot.  Not a project - so the bosses, not the bosses <br>  - so the team, not the team - so the salary ... There is a chance to burn wonderful <br>  any of these points (with good luck, for all) wherever you work, freelance <br>  at home in Ruby or repairing printers in a glorious state institution.  And yet, everyone <br>  The place has its own unique flavor. <br><br><br><h5>  Public sector </h5><br>  A typical place to start a career as a young specialist, as well as a permanent place <br>  habitat specialist mature for unknown reasons turned out here.  Well, <br>  Of course, there are many non-specialists who probably have something to do with IT, <br>  because otherwise they simply would not have been taken because of the inconsistency of their position.  Or <br>  would you take?  The state of the park of cars of this institution very often can you <br>  please (if you are a sophisticated connoisseur of antiquity and think that if not 640kb, then <br>  256 MB of memory is enough for everyone), and can leave you indifferent (if the technopark <br>  enterprises have already experienced a senile apocalypse, and on its wreckage it was decided <br>  to build a new world on the basis of the cheapest, but still modern equipment), <br>  and sometimes you may even be upset by the excesses that resulted from <br>  fun pre-Christmas fuss associated with the full development of the budget. <br><br>  As for stability, then your grandchildren may suffice it, which is impossible <br>  say about the prospects.  But after all, if there are no prospects, then there will be no grandchildren, and if not <br>  will be grandchildren, then there will be no problem.  Being a man with a fine sense of humor and <br>  low material needs, you can easily find yourself <br>  entertainment, ironically above the calculation table <br>  department. <br><br>  If you are a young specialist, but you do not have high-ranking <br>  relatives in the state structure, where do you want to go, and are not interested in history <br>  computer technology, then try before you get a job as much as possible <br>  clearly identify for yourself what goals you are pursuing.  Get professional <br>  development is almost impossible here, especially if you want to engage in IT, and not <br>  undercover games, dating or stuffing experience.  Avraly here are rare <br>  technologies are not applicable in other more paid sectors, the routine is great, efforts <br>  keeping the aging infrastructure huge, computer illiteracy and <br>  unwillingness of workers to learn is unlimited. <br><br><br><h5>  Private sector </h5><br>  Well what can I say?  The gradations from bad to good are so extensive here that <br>  give any exact picture of what is happening is impossible.  Anyway, there is <br>  he who says that everything is wrong.  So let's talk about the bad.  In any case speech <br>  below will be about small and medium-sized companies, mostly about those where IT is not <br>  is the main activity.  However, first things first. <br><br><br><h5>  Web studios. </h5><br>  Here it is the zero circle of hell, the eternal refuge of self-seeking students, and <br>  purgatory for tired souls of average specialists.  Typical organization of this type <br>  located in the basement, industrial area, a hotel that still stores memories of <br>  Soviet tourists from Vladivostok, - in general, everywhere where the enterprising owner <br>  web studios could find the cheapest place to rent.  Technique as a rule <br>  much better than in the public sector, because a large part of such studios are interrupted <br>  creating applications for the iPhone that has.  However, the frenzy of keyboards <br>  and mice can often cause a nostalgic tear in a person whose youth has passed <br>  in semi-basement computer clubs playing games in online shooters.  State can <br>  consist of a couple of programmers as well as an incomprehensible number <br>  workers coming in shifts and specializing in different things.  AND <br>  in the latter case, it is likely to see an idyllic picture in the smoking room when <br>  connoisseur of life ^ W Cocos2d teaches inexperienced Joomla-water.  Reverse idyll can <br>  to observe in the case when sales of utilities of this company in the appstore are not high, and <br>  rental of premises is largely hampered by the creation of business cards.  In rare <br>  In web studios you can find a secret table with a j2me developer, <br>  creating the same games that can be purchased in an amount of at least 3 pieces for <br>  one SMS. <br><br>  The example above remarkably illustrates the stability of web studios in terms of career <br>  growth, as well as the depth of learning technology.  In our opinion, web studio is one of <br>  the best places to start, after it will not be worse.  Only if you do not fall into <br>  another web studio where everything is still worse.  Here you will find everything: an incentive for self-learning - <br>  because no one knows what order your boss will intercept next time, and hire <br>  specialist for each profile is expensive and long;  avraly and deadlines - sin not to name <br>  unrealistic for the customer to get an order from a dozen of the same web studios and <br>  fifty freelancers;  incentive to increase revenue - an approximate ceiling in <br>  regional web studios - $ 500-700 per month;  experience of communication with people - <br>  low-skilled colleagues and most inadequate customers will give you <br>  true bliss when you finally leave the web studio and get settled <br>  a professional team, where the team leader is engaged in communication with customers or <br>  project manager. <br><br>  Of course, there are good web studios leading several large / high-yield <br>  projects where the workflow is less stable, well-organized, and your height <br>  as a specialist is possible.  Usually at the head of such studios is a strong programmer, <br>  still gaining good customers.  If the studio is headed by SEO-Schnick, designer, yes <br>  just an entrepreneur who was doing furniture yesterday, and today he decided to get angry by <br>  the Internet, then be on your guard.  Attitude towards programmers can be either <br>  dismissively beastly, or self-confidently amateurish.  Anyway you <br>  unsafe <br><br><br><h5>  Non-core companies </h5><br>  Namely - prodbases, supermarkets, trading offices, law offices, etc. <br>  All those places where programming manifests itself only in the form of editing configs 1C or <br>  same script writing for backups.  As a first prize you can get <br>  exclusive right to support intracorporate portal, honed under IE 6. <br>  Backups, workflow automation, virus scrubbing, reinstalling Windows, <br>  cable laying ... and much, much more. <br><br>  Perhaps this is the most interesting place to work, if you have some <br>  fist fight skills, or the ability to stay in a mixed team.  AND <br>  if a web studio can be called an IT school, then non-core enterprises can be called <br>  school of life.  For a stereotypical sysadmin, or experiencing not the best <br>  programmer's time working in such a place will be what is called going to the people. <br><br>  Technopark will be characterized by moderate conservatism, however, according to <br>  compared with state-owned enterprises, such progress achievements as <br>  PBX and LAN.  Here the corrosive reader exclaim that they say lokalku on <br>  he put the coaxial, and manually switched the PBX set up in the GORG.  though <br>  there is a difference.  The fact is that at state-owned enterprises, communications organizations usually <br>  the individual is engaged, as in more or less large private enterprises. <br>  A small private enterprise, led by the hand of the sacred economy and striving to <br>  minimizing costs, will rather hire one person to repair coffee makers, <br>  refilling printers, wall churning, cable laying, telephone, alarm, <br>  software installation and configuration in general and 1C in particular.  Do I need to clarify what to handle <br>  With all this, not everyone can do well?  Should I say to whom the stones will fly <br>  when something breaks somewhere?  Do I need to be reminded that the probability of failure is right <br>  proportional to the number of places where malfunction can occur? <br><br><br><h5>  Profile companies </h5><br>  In such large companies as Google, Yandex, Microsoft, etc., where the requirements for <br>  employees are high, and there are offices throughout the CIS, the situation is radically different - they don‚Äôt take them there <br>  people writing gall articles on Habr√©.  Therefore, for this category of companies we <br>  nothing to say. <br><br>  A mid-sized company recruits $ 400-800 students who write in Java. <br>  Attempts to settle in such companies as senior and timlid from our side <br>  suffered a fiasco due to our professional inappropriateness.  When our professional suitability <br>  has reached a level sufficient for these positions, defeat suffered attempts <br>  these companies invite us for an interview.  Therefore, in this category <br>  Companies we have nothing to say.  Although the topic is certainly fertile and deserving <br>  so that one of the readers has covered it in detail. <br><br><br><h5>  Freelance </h5><br>  Much has been written about this by many, and the topic has been beaten so badly that I don‚Äôt even want to <br>  repeat.  But it is necessary, dear readers, it is necessary.  After all, only such reprinting <br>  one-sided truths can be achieved by reducing the number of school-age professionals in <br>  freelance. <br><br>  Let's start with the fact that freelancing, and, in particular, Russian freelancing is seen by most <br>  of us is not just the focus of all evil, and no less than its embodiment.  Exactly <br>  here, in addition to the typical problems of hired work, more risks are added and <br>  competition.  This is where the most suitable place for the birth of a superman, ready <br>  work for free, overtime, possessing the gift of providence (and only this method <br>  allows you to estimate the likely project time required by the poorest description <br>  assignments, at the stage of his interception from student Stepan and schoolboy Vasily), who owns <br>  the whole range of web development skills, starting with setting up virtual servers on <br>  base kvm, and ending with the writing of "selling" texts and sharp design in Photoshop. <br><br>  We all understand that a good narrow specialist is better paid, but not all <br>  understand that: <br><br>  1) The narrowness of the specialist is inversely proportional to the breadth of the spectrum of vacancies in the market <br>  labor <br><br>  2) The amount of remuneration of a narrow specialist is directly proportional to the number of narrow <br>  specialists in this field <br><br>  3) The number of narrow specialists over time becomes back <br>  in proportion to the pay of these specialists <br><br>  4) The probability of employment of a specialist is directly proportional to his experience, <br>  which in turn is a function of such quantities as the number of vacancies per <br>  labor market and time spent on this experience <br><br>  5) The narrowness of the specialty is usually directly proportional to the threshold of entry into it. <br><br>  In short, PHP ‚Äë programmers with frontend programming experience are quite <br>  very promising people.  At the same time, the Haskell programmer is quite <br>  very narrow specialist.  In recent years, the popularization of information <br>  technology and social phobia has led to the fact that competition in freelancing has increased significantly <br>  so it is still unknown who to be worse - the jack of all trades or the master of his <br>  affairs  Those.  the labor market is not just big, but very big.  What does this lead to?  To that <br>  that the customer is a divine figure surrounded by an aura of permissiveness.  Highly <br>  It would be naive to believe that if he behaves like a beast, he will not find a performer and <br>  fill up the project without making a profit.  The abundance of labor supply allows him <br>  firstly, to collect passport data scans for a dozen of the first performers, secondly <br>  find a clever student who does the project, and who <br>  You may also be able to throw with payment. <br><br>  There is one subtlety - often the ability of a person as a specialist back <br>  proportional to his self-selling abilities.  Therefore find a good <br>  a specialist, to eat his brain, to get a finished project and not to pay is possible.  we <br>  even dare to say more: to get into freelancing without having the skills of "torsion" in <br>  society and even being a good specialist - this is obviously a game for the kill.  Or <br>  for good luck.  Depends on your worldview.  The number of competitors is from your <br>  worldview does not depend, and the fact that in the lower sector of freelancing (God forbid that <br>  it occupied only half of the market) competition comes primarily at a price during <br>  the second is in writing writing texts, the third is in order of priority, in <br>  the fourth - by the fact that you lied to yourself in the portfolio, and, finally, in the fifth - by <br>  professionalism. <br><br>  Freelance - this is a difficult way to build a portfolio, or rather difficult, if you <br>  pursue the goal also earn at the same time. <br><br><br><h5>  Projects </h5><br>  We immediately dismissed the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãsomehow classifying projects - too <br>  different specifics at different places of work.  Therefore, the only pattern <br>  which we almost unanimously deduced, can be stated as follows: the more <br>  Hemorrhoids gives the project / work, the less they pay for it.  You have to check <br>  the truth of this statement is from experience.  Just remember that if work <br>  reminds hell, and the salary inexorably strives for the minimum element of the set <br>  natural numbers, then most likely somewhere near there is a place where your skills and nervous <br>  cells will be valued much higher. <br><br>  As mentioned above, it is impossible to classify everything, but let's quickly <br>  let's go over freelance - the areas where the situation is most important <br>  grotesque form.  Moreover, we all went through this stage, and with all of us he was <br>  recognized as the most memorable in terms of negative experiences.  Especially if you - <br>  novice freelance programmer. <br><br>  Probably there is no greater evil for the novice inexperienced freelancer than small <br>  projects.  They give hope that by doing a little work it will be possible to raise <br>  reputation, and thus increase the likelihood of acquiring the next project. <br>  However, this hope is deceptive, and it may take a long time before such <br>  Freelancer will learn to distinguish between small projects and large brainwashing. <br><br>  The smaller the project, the greater the chance to know all the negative aspects. <br>  human nature, such as: greed, tyranny, bad manners, a tendency to <br>  cheating and god knows what else.  At that moment when it turns out that the TK described in the project, <br>  to which you subscribe, describes only a small part of the work offered to you, <br>  you can finally figure out who you are dealing with. <br><br>  It is logical not to expect anything good from a person who wants some kind of <br>  the work was done, but it does not have the money (or the desire to spend <br>  the required amount) for employee services.  This person has only 2 options - <br>  lies and coercion.  Rare freelancer does not distort from the first words of the customer about <br>  that he wants to continue working with you on other projects when the current <br>  is in a sluggish beginning stage - this is how our psyche prepares us for an unpleasant <br>  conflict with the interlocutor, who will have to explain why you are not ready <br>  now make concessions.  Conflict can be aggravated by the fact that people of this kind <br>  after incapacity admonitions love to move to threats like intentional <br>  reputation damage.  Generally, if you come to freelancing with the goal of being free from <br>  bosses and siburdination, you may be surprised to find that in order to <br>  to make any serious reputation you have to (in any case <br>  at first) fawn on customers with much more effort than you would like <br>  would.  We should not assume that communication in the format "I am the boss - you are a fool" is peculiar <br>  only for the post-Soviet freelancing sector. <br><br>  As for projects, everything is simple here - there are normal projects and there are <br>  cash.  The probability of getting a money project (let's say it can be <br>  perform and live on this money a few months) is extremely small - in any case, <br>  if you are an ordinary freelancer.  Such projects diverge between web studios and other <br>  major performers.  Although in the order of statistical fluctuation something can <br>  cross you too. <br><br>  Normal projects are routine, and usually include: <br><br><br><h5>  Sites business cards and promotional sites </h5><br>  Binary Roulette - either everything is simple and fast, or your brain will be eaten without <br>  the remainder.  The main difficulty lies in knowing the SEO and the basics of web graphics. <br>  Catalogs and online stores. <br><br>  The abundance of various engines for these does not mean absolutely nothing, unless you <br>  you can prove to the client that he has enough functions for his tasks that already exist. <br>  But through the hell of customization of the store engine, in order to obtain from it, for <br>  what it is not intended at all, you need to go at least in order to give yourself <br>  the covenant never do that again.  Often a customer wants a store promotion in <br>  competitive topics to be on the front page of Google.  Special <br>  the piquancy of the situation can add the fact that he can refuse to pay <br>  your work on the basis of precisely the absence of promotion to the necessary and sometimes impossible <br>  level  Always ask about search engine optimization. <br><br><br><h5>  Portals and social networks </h5><br>  Fortunately, few of the customers are haunted by the ghost of Zuckerberg‚Äôs success, and those <br>  excites you easily calculate on their offer to work for the option.  Mainly <br>  networks for any communities or clubs that are either made on the basis of <br>  engines are either written from scratch.  My humble experience on customization requirements <br>  suggests that using ready-made engines you almost inevitably come to the idea that <br>  it would be easier to write from scratch. <br><br><br><h5>  Modules for various CMS, engines, etc. </h5><br>  Tie the payment system, make the import from Excel, make the interface to <br>  some kind of service.  Most humane tasks when viewed from the point of view <br>  the programmer is firstly there is purely programming, secondly the criteria <br>  the assignment is clear enough to avoid unnecessary disputes with <br>  by the customer.  Well, there is some probability that the same module can be sold. <br>  someone else. <br><br><br><h5>  Upgrade an old engine for a new hosting or language version </h5><br>  Want to make a contribution to the piggy bank site govnokod.ru?  You came to the address.  Not necessary <br>  blame your distant predecessors - in those days ereg_replace is not yet <br>  was considered deprecated, and good practices have not yet been so obvious for only <br>  emerging web programming industry.  The degree of simplicity of the task depends on <br>  the extent of your perfectionism - the best option here is to make the site <br>  to work, and to fight with all the warrants is a thankless task. <br><br><br><h5>  Design change </h5><br>  Subtype of the previous item, if the engine is old.  Only routine work will be <br>  much more.  If the engine is written humanly, then you can relatively easily <br>  get off  For any large-scale website, redesign is an extremely difficult task. <br>  unpleasant, if only because the customer often asks to make changes on the move, <br>  and their complexity is changing.  A common situation is when localization is made like a god on <br>  put the soul and scattered on the engine, template and JS.  In this case, take on the project <br>  it is only after a detailed discussion with the customer, otherwise there is a chance that <br>  at the time of delivery, you simply will not have time to collect some working version of the updated <br>  site. <br><br><br><h5>  Corrections in the layout or front end </h5><br>  You never know what to expect. <br><br><br><h5>  Implementing some new features for one of the above options </h5><br>  If the engine is open, then everything is simple and pleasant.  If the engine is self-written, then <br>  the task is complicated by the fact that it is difficult to predict the execution time <br>  tasks.  Programmers of the old school often possess superpowers- skill <br>  write code that is protected from extension attempts.  So be prepared that in case <br>  non-standard engine your efforts will be mostly concentrated on <br>  so as not to break the old, and not to add something new. <br><br><br><h5>  Grabbers, posters, and other scripts </h5><br>  Programming, but not without subtleties.  In short, the payment is small, but from <br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Your scripts will require AI primordia. We need to get used to the idea that $ 50 is </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">quite a normal price for a program that can recognize any captcha, and then the </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">work will boil.</font></font><br><br><br><h5>  Mobile applications </h5><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">You no longer need to think that the interface to the web service worked on </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">half a dozen browsers, which means you now have time to think about how to </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">make your new application work equally correctly on a dozen </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">unsuited mobile devices. </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The most unpleasant option - to finish someone else's work. A sample ad </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">tells you that there is some site that needs to be completed in a very </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">small way. What does it mean? This means that, for some reason, the </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">contractor faded shortly before the project was completed, the main reasons for which may be as follows: </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">a) the customer is not an easy-to-communicate person</font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">b) the customer delayed the promised payment too long </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">c) the contractor realized that the customer‚Äôs requirements could not be met, and there were </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">two </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">options </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">: either the performer was a poor specialist and left behind bad code and </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">architecture, to which the remaining requirements could not </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">be stuck on the desire of the customer to do something impossible. </font></font><br><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Whether you should undertake such work is up to you.</font></font><br><br><br><h5>  And what is the result? </h5><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Each of us wants to do what he likes, but not everyone succeeds in it, or </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">only in words, and if you look at the work process, it will turn out that there are </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">many more things that you don‚Äôt like. There </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">are difficulties and trials </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">in the development of each specialist </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">, but </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">sometimes it is not easy to determine </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">where the boundary between them and objectively poor </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">working conditions are.
