It all started when a team of IT specialists met with a team from a completely different world, maybe even from a different universe - the content rights universe, ‚Äúmajors‚Äù, ‚Äúprime-time‚Äù, ‚Äúpay-per-view‚Äù, ‚Äúsher revenues "And together we began to do what later became KENGURU.TV.  For myself, the complexity of the device and the relationship within the film industry, I appreciate the complexity of the assembler for the Zilog Z80 microprocessor (I think this comparison will be closest to us, people associated with IT) - that is, to understand all this is quite real, with due desire, but we need mana.  ;) <br>  Instead of manuals, ‚Äúfilmmakers‚Äù have movie markets.  As you can see from the photo above, this is such a special place where all the fun is happening, and you begin to understand what it means to work, for example, with Universal or HBO.

Unfortunately, there is no other way to do it legally.  For me personally, it was a revelation of the number of types of rights to show a movie or a series.  Thus, it will not be possible to buy the rights ‚Äúfor displaying on the Internet‚Äù - the Internet is different. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/85d/cff/ce4/85dcffce41712bd444df1a1f6a807f29.jpg" alt="image"><br>  <i>(KPZ ‚ÄúEveryday work of the film industry employee‚Äù)</i> <br><br>  It turned out that domestic copyright holders are already aware of the ‚Äúnew media‚Äù, and not by hearsay know about trackers.  For half a year, crazy questionnaires rained down on us, which touched upon both purely legal issues and deeply technical ones.  Be prepared that Disney (well, not personally, of course, although after hundreds of answers, we didn‚Äôt even dream about that at night) will ask you about the ssl connections and how secure the content is being deleted after the contract came up to the end of <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/9ee/857/1c4/9ee8571c4b3ddeb4454fcd8c7a9cd078.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Despite all the difficulties, for one and a half years, we stubbornly moved towards the goal.  And this movement, for a second does not stop until now.  The most important incentive for us is a simple action pattern, the picture we drew for ourselves when it all began: not an abstract user, but someone and us, comes home after work, opens a laptop, walks in on Kangaroo and just clicks play. ".  We see "KENGURU.TV" solely as a place with free, high-quality films that are not ashamed to recommend for viewing to your friends.  Writing reviews of such films does not cause any pain in the pelvic region, you only have financial obligations to your ISP, moral and legal aspects of viewing make your karma smile :) <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/33a/4ee/8b8/33a4ee8b8cd3211f8ff82b20b2e1c4cd.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  <b>Well, about our "fall" and "uprising."</b> <br>  As it turned out, the correct server setup is far from everything.  We adequately experienced the Habro effect, and it would seem that nothing foreshadowed trouble.  Yeah, well.  Under the pressure of users surrendered iron.  The motherboard of the main server burned down, and with it, apparently, somewhere in the vicinity of the disk controller, dragging their contents to the other side of the Styx;) <br>  It took us a whole week to restore everything, reload movies and rent an additional server.  Fortunately, the backup database of KENGURU.TV was in a completely different place, so the user data remained intact. <br>  From here we learned a useful, albeit painful, lesson about the fact that you always need to have a server for ‚Äúsubstitution.‚Äù <br>  By the way, remembering the advertising company of our hosting, we were very hard to see for ourselves how their repairs were made, but we didn‚Äôt have time.  It all happened pretty fast :) <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/48c/019/2dd/48c0192dd3263af15e47f07e539e0091.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Now KENGURU.TV is operating normally.  We keep our promise - one new movie per day, and even overtake the schedule before the holidays, adding 2-3 at a time.  In addition to entertaining shows, <a href="http://kenguru.tv/film/viki-kristina-barselona">Wiki Christina Barcelona,</a> Woody Allen, and <a href="http://kenguru.tv/film/vozvrat">Return</a> are now available on the direct site ‚Äî an amazing English film that has evolved from a short film into a full-fledged film in just 25 days, and another attempt to film Bulgakov‚Äôs <a href="http://kenguru.tv/serial/master-i-margarita">The Master and Margarita</a> from the director of "Heart of a Dog". <br>  Your support is especially pleasant - the <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/kengurutv/blog/77186/">previous article on Habr√©</a> caused a resonance both among Twitter users and among bloggers.  We received a lot of useful tips and in the very near future, in accordance with some of them, we will improve the usability and speed of the site.  We have freed up time to write more and more. <br><br>  So, we do not say goodbye.
