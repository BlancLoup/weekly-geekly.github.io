For more than a day, PS Vita, the new wonder-console from Sony, which noble samurai sell on ebay for $ 500-600, is sold all over the territory of the Land of the Rising Sun.  However, few people know that for a month now, as in China, her twin sister is being sold for a price of just over $ 120.  Below about it and will be discussed. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/3e1b0be2/1e1bb823/254eadee/f1c89bfb.jpg"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Immediately I ask you to note that I personally don‚Äôt have the device in my hand and this preview preview will be based solely on the feedback from the happy owners of the device and the videos shot by them. <br><br><h2>  Specifications </h2><br>  <b>Display</b> : 5.0 inch TFT touchscreen ( <b>resistive</b> ) <br>  <b>Resolution</b> : 800x480 <br>  <b>Operating system</b> : Android 2.2.1 <br>  <b>Camera</b> : Rear - 5 megapixel (there is reason to believe that there are 3 with upscale to 5), frontal - 2 megapixel <br>  <b>CPU</b> : Cortex A9 AMlogic AML8726-M @ 800MHz ARMv7, does not support 3G, but supports USB-host (in practice, everything is completely different for now) <br>  <b>GPU</b> : Mali 400 395MHz <br>  <b>RAM</b> : 512M <br>  WiFi and FM <b>modules</b> <br>  <b>HDMI output</b> <br>  <b>Internal memory</b> : 4Gb (how much is actually available to the user - I can not say) <br>  <b>Dimensions</b> : 175mm x 75mm x 20mm <br>  <b>Weight</b> : 200g <br>  <b>Battery</b> : 2900mAh <br>  <b>Battery life</b> : 5 hours of video;  8 hours of music;  3-4 hours full load of the device. <br>  Of course, there is an accelerometer, support for hardware decoding of FullHD video (which, in conjunction with HDMI, can be very useful), Flash 10.x (probably higher), built-in microphone, stereo speakers, as well as all the goodies of a modern 5-inch android - the tablet. <br>  The device, surprisingly, does not have a GSM module, GPS and bluetooth, and the CPU does not support 3G.  The console communicates with the PC via USB 2.0. <br><br>  Externally, the system behaves responsively, the interface does not slow down.  The browser supports Flash version 10.x, however, I do not exclude the possibility of updating the player from the market to version 11. There is support for OpenGL ES 2.0.  The OS boots too quickly enough - in 30-40 seconds. <br>  The results of benchmarks can be found below: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/cad/c6d/821/cadc6d821533a7e9b36503cd2dc024e1.jpg"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/3c6/e0d/828/3c6e0d828504eded01fa1d7e2498b984.jpg"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/c31/a78/e64/c31a78e649b75bf5fd2711a3cb0ec195.jpg"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/e0e/2af/5fc/e0e2af5fca56124c219aa19226f69859.gif">

    <h2>  Appearance and equipment </h2><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/86a6a6d3/48bd191a/1634e24f/47f35626.jpg"><br>  Cute black (or white, as you like more) glossy toy, inexorably resembles a PSP Vita.  The dimensions are not very small - 175mm x 75mm x 20mm, which corresponds to the size of the PSP Fat.  Most of the device takes a resistive five-inch screen (about him separately below). <br>  On the left there is a cross, an analogue, a front-facing camera and an ESC button, which serves as the back button.  On the right - almost standard gaming keys with a somewhat non-standard letter designation, which, in other matters, does not affect the game at all. At the place of the second analogue, Vita has a dual Start, Select button.  Just below the function key.  If you hold it down, you can adjust the volume using the up / down keys on the joystick, respectively.  Where, on the joystick from Sony, there is a ‚Äútriangle‚Äù, and on the joystick from Xbox ‚ÄúY‚Äù there is an ‚ÄúOK‚Äù button.  What she does can be understood from the title.  In the menu, by the way, it is duplicated by the Start button. <br>  Top left and right are two shift, as on the PSP. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/eed19e5d/404a6d46/d8c53550/f614dd62.jpg"><br><br>  There is nothing interesting behind the camera's eye, as well as relief protrusions so that the console is more comfortable to hold in your hand.  I think it would be more confusing if the projections were made of soft-touch plastic, and not made of glossy gloss. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/9a54f60f/0382fff8/bd87e95d/71a068a0.jpg"><br><br>  At the bottom of the device (from left to right) there is a microSD memory card slot, which is typical, without a plug, <b>two</b> minijack 3,5mm headphones outputs (at first, it was thought that the second is a composite output for playing on TV, but alas) micro-USB connector, charger connector (charging via USB is not supported) and the reset button (: 3 very prudently). <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/febbc1bd/fb0276ca/10b357e2/3f10ec3c.jpg"><br><br>  The upper end holds on itself all that remains of the buttons familiar to android devices (from left to right): menu button, home, mini-HDMI, device off button.  On the sides, familiar to everyone who has ever seen the PSP, transparent buttons Shiftov.  And that's all. <br><br>  Assembling the device is not up to par, but does not cause any special complaints.  The sleek glossy plastic from which the entire body of the device is made immediately catches the eye.  More than anything bad about the build quality to say, alas, I can not.  However, good too. <br>  I‚Äôll focus on the buttons separately - they are pressed with a noticeable click, so it‚Äôs best to play with headphones.  The analogue, which is under the cross, is indeed analog, but in games and applications it behaves strangely - it duplicates the cross.  At first, there were doubts about its truth, but the preparation of the device dispelled all doubts.  Photos of the analysis can be found here - <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/53589715%40N03/">http://www.flickr.com/photos/53589715@N03/</a> .  Kerbing in the core also confirms the analogy of the analogue - CONFIG_ADC_KEYPADS_AM = y.  Maybe with the release of the firmware update, something will change. <br>  I note that complaints about the work of the cross are skipping, then it falls down, then it behaves inadequately.  It is treated by wipe through recovery and clearing the rubber under the cross.  China is such a China. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/baa9852e/a475b075/9301f1cd/cc80c205.jpg"><br><br>  The device comes in a small box, a little more than the device itself.  Inside the console, instructions in Chinese and warranty card (sic!), Power supply with a Chinese plug, poor headphones, a cord for connecting to a PC and a noname 4GB memory card.  Quite a standard gentleman's set. <br><br>  Included with the device is also a bunch of pre-installed emulators.  Most of them are paid versions of emulators from the market.  There are Sega MD, NES, SNES, MAME, Playstation, Nintendo 64, GameBoy, GameBoy Avance, Sega MasterSystem, Sega GameGear emulators, but there is no market out of the box - you need to install it separately. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/OSa2m3_D7mE&amp;xid=17259,15700022,15700186,15700191,15700253,15700255,15700259&amp;usg=ALkJrhjBlRN-tuyEP3oImjtjqQO0KNGw5Q" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br><h2>  Screen </h2><br>  The screen makes a very good impression.  Five inches, resistive, very responsive, 800x480 resolution, 16 million colors.  In videos it may seem that his responsiveness is bad, however, this is due to the fact that shooting and working with the screen at the same time is not convenient.  I also note good screen viewing angles: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/596b6903/a298f6d9/a9bfe8e1/0139c3dd.jpg"><br>  It is not clear, however, how the device will behave with modern android-games, which do not even know about the existence of buttons.  A capacitive screen at least for two touches would be very useful, but alas.  Simple toys, those that have just one touch, behave adequately and responsively.  Statesmen would have liked: <br><video>  http: // http: //www.youtube.com/watch? v = C_J0RdhPGD4 </video><br>  The form factor of the device is somewhere between the tablet and the game console, which, in conjunction with the touchscreen, gives a good support for browsing.  And the ARMv7 processor allows you to put any of the modern browsers. <br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/sxqEHMfOEV0%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700022,15700186,15700191,15700253,15700255,15700259&amp;usg=ALkJrhiHvC6JglKRnGXLft7EOwsHf6LuEw" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br><h2>  Software </h2><br>  Onboard the device is a standard Android 2.2.1.  Neither the modified interface, nor alternative launchers.  But the full clip emulators for almost any platform younger than 2000.  All the standard for Android hardkey buttons for some reason duplicated in the status bar android. <br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/9HBaFZyex_Y%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700022,15700186,15700191,15700253,15700255,15700259&amp;usg=ALkJrhjR34EHq3-CDinW8qOSqtRZWvqv1w" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br>  The menu is fast and responsive, however, I personally would advise immediately changing the launcher to something more convenient.  Most of the pre-installed programs are naturally emulators.  I believe that the main target audience consists of emulators.  They will not be particularly indignant about the resistive screen =) <br>  Most emulators belong to the .EMU series, which, as we know, are not free.  For Nintendo 64 emulation, n64droid is used, for PSX - FPSe.  MAME - TigerMAME, although it would be more logical to use MAME4All.  Interestingly, the emulators are embedded in the firmware and without root they cannot be so easily deleted.  But then, after downloading them from the market and making sure that they work normally, you can hope for auto-updates and reassign the hard buttons.  Remember what and how it is emulated on the android possible thanks to this article - <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/android/111168/">habrahabr.ru/blogs/android/111168</a> <br>  Emulation is at a very high level, anti-aliasing, various types of display, frame-skip, quixave, and so on are supported.  A little nadlagivaet n64, but I think with each new version of the emulator lag will be less and less.  The PSX is almost perfectly emulated.  Evaluate the work of the programs below links: <br>  <b>PSX</b> : <br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/VZhIeBHZPms%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700022,15700186,15700191,15700253,15700255,15700259&amp;usg=ALkJrhiGxEg27_S7bkDdy3y5IlQnMjchzA" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br>  <a href="http://v.youku.com/v_show/id_XMzI5NTc2MTY0.html">http://v.youku.com/v_show/id_XMzI5NTc2MTY0.html</a> <br>  <b>Scumm VM</b> : <br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/WYl2yhTB4Dg%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700022,15700186,15700191,15700253,15700255,15700259&amp;usg=ALkJrhjrBywZi0wMDpc-AzABT4ue3zKslw" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br>  <b>Nintendo 64 via HDMI</b> : <br>  <a href="http://v.youku.com/v_show/id_XMzI0MzQ3Mjky.html">http://v.youku.com/v_show/id_XMzI0MzQ3Mjky.html</a> <br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/U2OoDHoV-AE%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700022,15700186,15700191,15700253,15700255,15700259&amp;usg=ALkJrhjiDnyO-Fs8W8uKyT4cW7b1aGRkNQ" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br>  <b>SEGA MD</b> : <br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/_CHNW5flzro%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700022,15700186,15700191,15700253,15700255,15700259&amp;usg=ALkJrhhqNNaD8tlsfXpuq3zcAGJa44VSLA" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br>  <b>SNES</b> : <br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/1AxC8PSEKgI%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700022,15700186,15700191,15700253,15700255,15700259&amp;usg=ALkJrhhW9lFiB3KVl3LZYul4k6pWfBNxpw" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br>  In addition to emulators, most modern games work.

In addition, the developers promised in six months to invest in porting 2.3 to the device, and also not to throw emulators and periodically throw out their updates.  I really hope that someone with xda notice and love the console, which is usually fraught with beautiful offspring.  You look and ICS will appear.
