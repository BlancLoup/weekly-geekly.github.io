Like previous versions, the new lab will be a corporate network with vulnerabilities and configuration errors.  Anyone can take part. <br><br>  Laboratories ‚ÄúTest lab‚Äù allow information security specialists to test their skills in penetration testing of information systems and to prepare for repelling cyber threats to their systems.  The concept of pledged topical vulnerabilities contributes to the awareness of weak points and the improvement of protective equipment, as well as an adequate assessment of pentest's own skills legally, without violating the law, in an environment as close as possible to real ones. <a name="habracut"></a>

    <h2>  Test lab v.9 is coming soon! </h2><br>  The new laboratory will be a virtual company CyBear 32C, which develops various systems and applications, including information security systems.  Given the nature of the activity, CyBear 32C is well protected from hacker attacks, and its compromise will require high-quality training in the field of practical information security. <br><br>  In our laboratories, we try to reflect current threats and risks of compromising information systems.  Recently, attacks by professional cyber-criminal groups and single hackers against technology companies related to the development of information security systems, protection tools and the development of cyber-weapons have become more frequent. <blockquote>  The well-known cyber group Hacking Team, which specializes in the development and sale of special spyware for law enforcement agencies and special services of various states, has become the target of cyber attacks, as a result of which an archive of 400GB of various confidential information has become available to the public.  The Hacking Team‚Äôs personal correspondence with their clients, contracts for the sale of their cyber-products to various states, as well as a large amount of other information related to the company's activities have leaked to the network. <br></blockquote>  It would seem that such companies should be better prepared than others to attack and repel hacker attacks, but in practice this is far from true: <blockquote>  The site of AvSoft Technologies, a company engaged in the development of antivirus software under the AVG brand, was attacked by hackers.  The attackers placed on the AvSoft website a code that downloaded malware onto the victims' PCs. <br></blockquote>  Even high-tech companies specializing in the development of countering hackers can be successfully (albeit partially) attacked: <blockquote>  An attack on the corporate network of Kaspersky Lab was discovered in the spring of 2015.  According to preliminary results of the investigation, Kaspersky Lab was not the only target of the attackers, and other victims in Western, Middle Eastern and Asian countries (most likely, many more affected) have already been discovered.  ‚ÄúThe way of thinking and tactics of the Duqu 2.0 group is by a whole generation ahead of any cyber attacks and malicious campaigns encountered before,‚Äù writes Kaspersky Lab. <br></blockquote>  In our new laboratory, we will provide everyone to try their hand at breaking into a technology company whose employees are ready to repel hacker attacks and consider their infrastructure to be invulnerable. <br><br><h2>  "Test lab v.8" is still open </h2><br>  Currently, the 8th laboratory is available, which is a commercial bank with an IT structure inherent in it, including modern systems for countering attacks.  Currently, more than 7,500 participants have registered in the laboratory, 700 participants have successfully succeeded in attacking at least one of the laboratory systems, while only 40 attackers were able to completely compromise the bank.  You can get acquainted with the partial passage of the laboratory ‚ÄúTest lab v.8‚Äù by the <a href="https://lab.pentestit.ru/docs/TL8_WU_ru.pdf">link</a> .  In the meantime, our team is completing the development of a new laboratory.  See you in ‚ÄúTest lab v.9‚Äù, which will be even cooler! </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/281749/">https://habr.com/ru/post/281749/</a></p>
