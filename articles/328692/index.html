We solve all organizational issues <a href="https://www.meetup.com/TechGuruDay/">at the Meetup.com platform</a> , and we share our painful issues and <a href="https://www.meetup.com/TechGuruDay/">treat ourselves to</a> buns at offline meetings, such as the ‚ÄúMai Mayap‚Äù. <br><br>  We invite you to join our company.  More details about the upcoming meeting and a small excursion into the history of our meetings (with links to presentations and video presentations) can be found inside the post.

This technology allows you to quickly create many full independent test environments from a single data warehouse.  This topic will be of interest not only to the MS SQL community, but also to those who work with Oracle databases. <br><br>  <b>Rafael Valiullin</b> (B &amp; N Digital, ‚ÄúBinbank‚Äù) will share information about the proprietary development of the object-relational framework for SQL Server.  The report will necessarily contain information on the patterns used for these purposes and on the advantages of such an approach. <br><br>  <b>Lestat Kim</b> (KORUS Consulting) will talk about the T-SQL design standard: the basic rules for the design of T-SQL code, as well as various techniques for writing programs.  The purpose of the report is to provide general rules that allow to preserve a single style of writing code and facilitate its understanding by all team members. <br><br>  The meeting will be held on May 18, 2017 in the LANIT office at the address: 14 Murmansk Prospect, Moscow, 1.  We will communicate from 19 to 22 hours. <br><br>  Transport from m. Riga. <br>  From 17:30 to 19:30 from the Rizhskaya metro station (the stop is directly opposite the only exit), our shuttle buses to the office will run.  The interval is about 20 minutes.  On the plate on the windshield of the bus should be written "LANIT".  At the entrance, tell the driver that the conference at LANIT. <br><br>  <b>ATTENTION!</b> <br><br><ul><li>  In order for everyone to have enough space and cookies, we need to know how many people are going to visit.  Therefore, <b>electronic registration is</b> required <a href="https://www.meetup.com/TechGuruDay/events/239570379/">on the event page</a> .  You can log in to meetup.com through a Facebook account or Google account. <br><br></li><li>  To enter the building, you will need to present a <b>passport</b> or other identity document. <br><br></li><li>  Parking should not be a problem closer to the beginning of the event, just pay attention to the road signs, as  there are limitations. <br></li></ul><br>  With us - the video (all the videos must be laid out), as well as cookies with tea and a pleasant company of like-minded people! <br><br>  With you - fighting spirit, the desire to learn something new and the willingness to share their experiences;) <br><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">And now a small excursion into the history of TechGuruDay mitaps in LANIT</b> <div class="spoiler_text">  Meetup.com is an international platform for creating communities of various interests.  The main idea of ‚Äã‚Äãthe site is to transfer communication from the Internet to the real life of people.  At meetup.com they organize meetings, meetings, parties, summits, meetings, meetings, meetings, all events that make people get out of the web.  Since we represent an IT company, we are primarily interested in like-minded people in the IT field.  In 2016, we created a TechGuruDay group at the site meetup.com, within which we announce and hold meetings of IT specialists.  There is not much time left from work (and this is precisely non-working time), but during the existence of the group we have already held two events and we have ambitious plans. <br><br>  <a href="https://www.meetup.com/TechGuruDay/events/230686090/">Our first mitap</a> was dedicated to PostgreSQL DBMS. <br>  <a href="https://www.meetup.com/TechGuruDay/events/231100084/">Our second mitap</a> was dedicated to developing in the Java language. <br></div></div><br>  We will be grateful if you tell our third meeting about your friend who are not yet members of <a href="http://www.meetup.com/TechGuruDay/">TechGuruDay</a> .  More people - more opinions, more knowledge, more mutual benefits. <br><br>  Questions - in the comments or on twitter <a href="https://twitter.com/techguruday">@TechGuruDay</a> . <br><br>  You can follow the announcements and events in FB and Twitter using the hashtag #techguruday. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/328692/">https://habr.com/ru/post/328692/</a></p>
