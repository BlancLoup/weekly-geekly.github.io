      The architecture defines functional blocks (Figure 1) used in a wide range of solutions for incident management, urban and public security, border control, protection of critical infrastructure and property, mass gathering and mass events, transport, the judicial and penal system, etc. . <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/c60/25a/655/c6025a655b46487e9aed240b916f1ea2.jpg"><br>  <i>Picture 1</i> <br><br>  The Cisco CSS solution is built on IP-based technologies, which allow a flexible approach to the placement of the components of the solution, the scalability of the system and ensure the openness of the platform for its integration with adjacent systems, including high-level management systems. <br><br>  <b>Event collection</b> <br><br>  Sources of events in the architecture of Cisco CSS are surveillance cameras, access points of the access control system and other sensors (including IoT sensors), which can be integrated through connection via dry contacts on cameras and access controllers or at the application level.  Events are generated automatically (for example, the operation of the embedded video analytics algorithm), automated (for example, a presentation of a badge to the reader) or manually (for example, forcibly by an operator command). <br>  The Cisco digital surveillance camera line covers all common video surveillance tasks.  In addition to a rich set of settings and operating parameters, the cameras have advanced tools for integrating with an IP network using Cisco Medianet features.  These functions provide automatic detection and configuration of a video surveillance camera when it is connected to an IP network, eliminating operator errors during configuration and significantly speeding up the deployment of a video surveillance system. <br><br>  Cisco cameras also support embedded video analytics, which, in addition to the ready-made set of algorithms, allow you to download algorithms created by the company's technology partners.  In the line there are cameras of all types: guided PTZ and fixed, encased and dome cameras, as well as specialized cameras designed for installation at transport facilities. <br><br>  To connect analog cameras are offered IP-encoders with 4 or 8 ports. <br><br>  The ACS product portfolio is represented by IP gateways that integrate end equipment (door locks, buttons, readers, contacts, audiovisual notification tools) into an integrated network of physical security based on IP technologies. <br><br>  <b>Event Analysis</b> <br><br>  Depending on the problem being solved, event analysis in a Cisco CSS solution is an automated or automated process.  In the first case, the system operator can configure the script for processing inbound events, without human intervention, providing feedback to the periphery. <br><br>  The Cisco CSS solution consists of the following components: <br><br>  - Software for processing and archiving video information Cisco Video Surveillance Manager (VSM), which provides distributed processing of video, audio information and information about events, safe and secure storage of video archives on local disks or external storage, advanced search in video on events from motion detection, specified time interval or events from external systems, integration with other security and control applications using open program interfaces (APIs). <br><br>  - Cisco Physical Access Manager (CPAM) access control and management software for managing access control, peripherals and user access controllers.  CPAM can be integrated with Cisco VSM to synchronize signals from the access control system with video. <br><br>  - Software Cisco Unified Management Physical Security Operations Manager (PSOM), which provides a single management console of physical security equipment in organizations, including geographically distributed.  PSOM aggregates information from sensors, analyzes and correlates events, executes user-created information processing scripts. <br><br>  <b>Reaction to events</b> <br><br>  The standard way to communicate when responding to incidents and events is voice.  The Cisco CSS solution allows you to complement the standard multimedia communication tools (playing live video or video recordings, showing photos, participating in video conferencing, instant messaging). <br>  The key component of the unit is the Cisco IP Interoperability and Collaboration System (IPICS) software.  Its functionality allows users of various radio communication systems to communicate with each other and with users of traditional and cellular telephony. <br><br>  The components of Cisco IPICS are the following products: <br><br>  - Cisco IPICS servers.  It is used to manage policies, trunking groups, radio channels, media resources, user authentication. <br><br>  - Cisco IPICS Dispatch Console operator control panel.  Based on IP technologies, the console gives staff the ability to combine, under one management, the functionality of traditional control panels with new communication channels: mobile devices, clients for personal computers and telephony. <br><br>  - Cisco IPICS Mobile Client.  An application for smartphones that provides them with PTT function in combination with rich multimedia features, such as viewing a video or a photo with an incident. <br><br>  - Client for Cisco IPICS IP Phone Client.  The ability to use Cisco Unified IP Phones IP phones to interact with staff via PTT channels. <br><br>  - Cisco Universal Media Server.  Responsible for connecting various audio channels to a single broadcast environment based on policies and settings received from the Cisco IPICS management server. <br><br>  - Gateway with P25 networks and support for Tetra Peripheral Equipment Interface (PEI).  Provides IP-based network connectivity with traditional radio networks. <br><br>  <b>Benefits of Using Cisco Connected Safety and Security Solutions</b> <br><br>  - The openness of the platform ensures the integration of end devices, adjacent systems and high-level control systems. <br><br>  - The use of IP technologies facilitates the implementation and maintenance of the system and enhances its capabilities. <br><br>  - Virtualization of all components provides transparent growth and flexible possibilities for system design. <br><br>  - Scaling gives confidence in the growth of the system without the need to replace its elements. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/303246/">https://habr.com/ru/post/303246/</a></p>
