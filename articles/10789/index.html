How does this threaten humanity? ‚Äù</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"> The blockbuster of Mel Gibson‚Äôs ‚ÄúApocalypse‚Äù about the mysterious Mayan civilization that was released last December generated an unprecedented interest in its secret knowledge.  And according to the legendary calendar.  The heat was immediately added by the publishers who published several books with frightening titles: ‚Äú2012: The Return of Quetzalcoatl‚Äù, ‚Äú2012 Apocalypse: A Scientific Study of the End of Civilization‚Äù, ‚ÄúRevolution 2012: Preparation‚Äù. <br><br>  People are naturally scared - waiting for something terrible.  For example, the end of the world, they say, the Mayans foresaw it and therefore completed their calendar with a specific date. <br><br>  In fact, it‚Äôs not the calendar that ends, but the so-called Great Cycle.  Or "The Fifth Sun" in Maya terminology with a length of 5126 years.  The last day of this cycle is December 21, 2012.  Then the next one will begin.  But it inspires terrible fears.

    <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  WHAT ARE PREDICTED <br><br>  According to scientists, the "Fifth Sun" began on August 13, 3113 BC.  Why exactly then?  What event was this related to?  Nobody knows.  As well as it is not known, where did the ancient Maya in general take their sophisticated numbering system by going time and dividing it into cycles.  Nevertheless, modern people believe that the meaning was here.  And with might and main they prophesy.  They predict cataclysms that mark the beginning of the next Great Cycle of the Mayan Calendar - the Sixth Epoch of Creation, or the Sixth Sun. <br><br>  Joseph Lawrence, the book ‚ÄúApocalypse 2012: A Scientific Study of the End of Civilization‚Äù: The solar system will die as a result of an ‚Äúeclipse‚Äù in the central part of the Milky Way.  Or deviate from its axis and begin a chaotic motion on the cosmic expanses. <br><br>  The book "2012: The Return of Quetzalcoatl": earthquakes, volcanic eruptions, hurricanes and huge tidal waves will destroy half of the planet. <br><br>  Andrew SMITH, the 2012 Revolution: Preparation book: restoring the true balance between divine feminine and masculine beginnings. <br><br>  Alexander Filatov, designer of the Federal Nuclear Center, Sarov: a planet will pass close to the Earth, causing the global flood, pole shift, climate change. <br><br>  Peter JAMES and Nick TORP, University of California: The Earth will collide with an asteroid. <br><br>  OPINION ASTRONOMA <br><br>  "Earth is not threatened yet" <br><br>  Valentin ESIPOV, Head of the Department of Radio Astronomy of the State Astronomical Institute.  Sternberg: <br><br>  - Any calendar is simple: it takes into account the movement of the planets around the sun.  And the more accurate the observation of cosmic bodies, the more accurate the chronology.  We now have the most accurate calendar.  And the ancient Indian tribes did not know much.  In addition, we monitor all comets and asteroids that can fly past us in the next ten years.  And with full responsibility I declare that nothing threatens the Earth. <br><br>  OPINION MATHEMATICS <br><br>  ‚ÄúWe build only guesses‚Äù <br><br>  Vladimir PAHOMOV, a mathematician, physicist, former researcher at the Joint Institute for Nuclear Research, author of the book ‚ÄúMessage to the Unborn‚Äù: <br><br>  - It became known about the Mayan calendar due to the fact that they had a custom to put steles in all the settlements - stone pillars on which important events were recorded with the date indicated.  The descriptions of their Mayan calendar, we have left.  That is, maybe there was such a description, but tens of thousands of Mayan handwritten books were burned by Catholic monks.  Only stone steles are preserved.  Therefore, we can only make various assumptions about their calendar system.  For example, the myth of the high accuracy of the Mayan calendar is not justified.  When indicate the accuracy of the calendar, recording the number of days in the year with an accuracy of ten decimal places, do not believe it.  Calendar is not a chronometer.  The smallest value in any calendar is one day.  And for measuring smaller times, clocks and stopwatches are used. <br><br>  OPINION COSMONAVTA <br><br>  ‚ÄúAliens will fly to us again‚Äù <br><br>  Pilot-cosmonaut George Grechko: <br><br>  - I think the Mayan calendar ends later: December 23, 2013.  After all, the year of reference is still unknown: maybe from 0 they started, and maybe from one.  And then, to create a calendar, we need at least a primitive telescope and an accurate clock.  And the Maya were a bloody civilization.  They even pulled hearts from living people during the sacrifice.  And in a ball game the captain, whose team lost the match, was beheaded before the eyes of the spectators.  I am still amazed by this incompatibility of high intellect and savagery of manners.  And therefore I do not believe that they could create an exact calendar.  I think the aliens gave it to them.  Consider that this is my fantasy, but I think that when the calendar ends in 2012 or 2013, they will fly again to either give us a new calendar or send us another Flood.  We, say, the 5th civilization, and 4 previous they destroyed for bad behavior - some floods, others - sulfur fire from the sky. <br><br>  And now we behave badly: we accumulate weapons, we spoil nature.  Even from space we can see what kind of wounds we inflicted on Earth.  And the aliens come to us, like at a resort.  And they - ‚Äúinvented‚Äù us ‚Äî homo sapiens ‚Äî in order to preserve the planet, as the housekeeper must maintain a house before the owners arrive from vacation.  They came up with a stone, a bronze century and, finally, they thought that gold was about to come when they would fly in again and give us new knowledge.  But we are their "resort" fuck up.  And I think that if we continue to behave badly, the aliens will give us another disaster. <br><br>  I invented such a horror story so that people would think about it, start loving the Earth and each other, and not accumulate weapons. <br><br>  OPINION OF THE ASTROLOGY <br><br>  "Fraught with destructive processes" <br><br>  Boris Pyasik: <br><br>  - December 12, 2012 is the day when the configuration on the firmament is not easy.  This is the last day of the lunar month, which is considered to be ‚Äúsatanic‚Äù: Jupiter is connected to the Black Moon, the planet of negative karma, and the intense planetary aspect of Pluto is observed with Uranus.  In addition, all this will occur during the time when Uranus changes its direction of movement, which is fraught with strong destructive processes.  I do not know whether the specified day will be ‚Äúthe last day of Pompeii‚Äù, but, apparently, it will bring a lot of trouble. <br><br>  OPINION SKEPTICA <br><br>  ‚ÄúThere will be no end of the world‚Äù <br><br>  Mikhail LEITUS, Chairman of the International Skeptics Club: <br><br>  - In the XV century over the minds of Russian fearful thought about the imminent end of the world, which was expected after the seventh thousand years from the creation of the world.  According to the Greek-Russian chronology, seven thousand years ended just in 1492.  Therefore, the liturgical Easter, indicating the months and numbers of the celebration of Easter, was brought only to 1492.  When the fateful year passed safely, the Jews began to sneer at the Orthodox: ‚ÄúSeven thousand years ended, and your Paschalia passed, why is Christ not, contrary to your expectations? ..‚Äù <br><br>  At the beginning of the eighth thousand years, in September 1492, the Cathedral gathered in Moscow and decided to write Paschalia for the eighth thousand years. <br><br>  Now the end of the period can be considered a hundred years, and a thousand.  And before the year 1000, and before 2000, mass hysteria ensued, connected with the end of the world.  But he did not come.  I think you should not be afraid of 2012 too. <br><br>  6 MAIN QUESTIONS ABOUT MAYA <br><br>  Four civilizations have already died <br><br>  They tell the doctor of historical sciences, a researcher at the Center for Natural Sciences, Alexander DORONIN, and the director of the Esoteric Center for the Epoch of Aquarius, Veniamin Sherman. <br><br>  1. Where did the name come from <br><br>  The word "maya" exists in ancient Indian philosophy - it has two meanings: "the source of this world" and "the illusory world."  How it got from Asia to Central America is unknown.  But the Mayans appeared there in the 10th century BC and in just 500 years, a civilization was created at the place of impassable tropical forest, where astronomy, mathematics, architecture, sculpture, painting were developed.  And ... mysteriously disappeared.  By 830 AD, after 500 years of tireless activity, all their main centers were abandoned. <br><br>  2. What they discovered <br><br>  Mayan merit is usually put their calendar system.  But they also calculated the eclipse cycles, made up the synchronization tables of the periods of rotation of Mercury, Venus, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn and the Moon.  And for some reason, special attention was given to the constellation Gemini and Pleiades. <br><br>  3. How to count the days <br><br>  The Mayan calendar was based on the mythical starting date - August 13, 3113 BC.  From it, by simple counting of the number of days gone by, and the chronology was kept.  By the way, and we use the mythical date of the ‚Äúbirth of Christ‚Äù for our time. <br><br>  The Mayan calendar, despite its antiquity, is surprisingly accurate.  According to modern calculations, the duration of the solar year is 365.2422 days.  Maya calculated the value of 365.2420 days.  The difference is only two ten-thousandth.  To compile such an exact calendar, according to scientists, it would have been necessary to observe and record the movements of the planets for about ten thousand years. <br><br>  4. How long is the calendar <br><br>  Maya believed that the universe exists in the framework of the great cycles.  But for some reason, several calendar systems were used to count them: 1) The 365-day year - haab - consisted of 18 months of 20 days each. <br><br>  2) 360-day year - tun. <br><br>  3) The 260-day year - Tzolkin (in translation - ‚Äúthe count of days‚Äù) - consisted of 13 months, 20 days each.  He was called the sacred calendar. <br><br>  The week contained 13 days.  In addition, there was also a 9-day week.  Maya invented names and certain time intervals: <br><br>  Uinal - 20 days, <br>  tun - 360 days <br>  Katun - about 20 years, <br>  Baktun - approximately 394 years old - thirteen baktuns end exactly in 2012, <br>  Pictun - 7885 years old <br>  Kalabtun - 158 000 years, <br>  Kinciltun - 3 million years <br>  alautun - 63 million years. <br><br>  It turns out that the calendar is adapted for measuring giant periods of time.  As if the Mayans were going to live forever ... <br><br>  5. What is a galactic ray <br><br>  Maya believed that during the Great Cycle - from 3113 BC.  er  till 2012 year n.  er  - human history is governed by a certain galactic ray emanating from the ‚Äúgalactic nucleus‚Äù - the Earth and the Sun pass through it.  Pass in accordance with the "galactic seasons", which were described by the Maya in mathematical and symbolic form. <br><br>  The galactic ray, in terms of Maya, is similar to the beam of a lighthouse, which expands with distance from the source.  Suppose the ray glides over a boat sailing far into the ocean.  In a certain period of time it will be lit.  The same happens with the Earth, crossing the galactic ray.  The point of entry of the Earth into the beam corresponds to the ‚Äústarting date‚Äù of Maya - August 13, 3113 BC.  er  The same date falls on December 21, 2012.  Will it come in again? <br><br>  6. What happened to the ‚ÄúFifth Sun‚Äù <br><br>  The Mayan priests said that since the creation of the human race, four cycles have already passed, or the ‚ÄúSun‚Äù.  The four human races that died during the great cataclysms changed.  And only a few people survived, telling about what happened. <br><br>  The ‚ÄúFirst Sun‚Äù lasted for 4008 years and was destroyed by earthquakes.  The ‚ÄúSecond Sun‚Äù lasted for 4010 years and was destroyed by hurricanes.  The ‚ÄúThird Sun‚Äù lasted for 4081 and fell under the fiery rain that fell from the craters of huge volcanoes.  "The Fourth Sun" (5026 years) destroyed the flood. <br><br>  Now we live in the last katun of the Fifth Epoch of Creation, or the "Fifth Sun".  It is also known as the ‚ÄúSun of Movement‚Äù.  Maya believed that at the end of the current, 5126-year cycle, there would be some movement of the Earth. <br><br>  Source: <a href="http://www.interfax-religion.ru/national/%3Fact%3Dprint%26div%3D6041">www.interfax-religion.ru/national/?act=print&amp;div=6041</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/10789/">https://habr.com/ru/post/10789/</a></p>
