This happened a long time ago, but, as they say, the sediment remained. <br><br>  So, for my birthday, my friends did not find anything better than to give me a new keyboard from Genius.  I celebrated this wonderful day with a cake and salads in my computer club for the party in the COP all night.  I decided to immediately connect to check that yes how.  Played 5 minutes.  Something was wrong, but I was too lazy to understand.  I put the old one in place and continued. <br><br>  At home I started testing more tightly.  I found that the shift + w + d buttons, which are extremely important for a gamer, are not pressed together.  I sat testing for a long time and realized that no three buttons except ctrl + alt + del (haha) were pressed together at all.  Came to the store, I must say, famous and big then.  Now, the unknown and the small - see, the attitude towards customers has done its job.

      I was kicked at the service department, where I waited for someone for a long time.  Finally, the old men came, took the keyboard, hooked up, began to poke.  All right, they say.  I tell them how it is, three buttons are not pressed together in games.  To which I received a question with a grin ‚Äúbut what for might you need to press three buttons at once?  except for the well-known combination. "  In general, I did not like the attitude immediately.  They sent me away with the conclusion that the clave is working. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  It is clear that there was such a cant, which manifested itself when playing in two on the same keyboard, but so that the three buttons were not pressed, I had never seen. <br><br>  I spent some time testing the joint and came up with a simple test on a notebook.  I came again, they say, look, I press w - a stream of characters is running, I press s - I‚Äôm running s.  Everything is ok, but I press shift + w and then s - s no longer runs.  They laughed at me again, they said they would test it and took it for themselves. <br><br>  For some time I called, tried to find out what and how, in the end I came, and my clave was in the same place where she had been thrown.  I took it, went to the manager and asked if we could just return the money?  He looked, found some sort of scuffing (which the grief of the technicians did to me, anyway) and refused.  Talk type with service. <br><br>  I again went to the service and stood there for a long time proving again the brokenness of the keyboard and the impossibility of using it for its intended purpose.  All this is rather tired of me already.  And then it turned out that they already know about such a shoal, and that "this is a chip of this keyboard, so put up with it."  Is this how you put up?  Nowhere about this is not written and the purchase does not say.  But they refused to write about nonworking. <br><br>  Realizing that nothing can be done, I caught when their director arrives and insolently went to his office.  He said that such a story, I don‚Äôt care anymore - a matter of principle.  He asked that it is more expensive to him, the reputation of the company or some N rubles for an unhappy keyboard, because my local report will be available on local forums.  And most of the clients are students and local IT professionals who read it all. <br><br>  He immediately ordered me to take the keyboard.  I received the money and did not have more business with this company. <br><br>  I did not write on the forums, but word of mouth and their attitude towards customers did their job.  What I'm glad of course.  Less such here on the market. <br><br>  Well, I don‚Äôt buy Genius products either. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/72691/">https://habr.com/ru/post/72691/</a></p>
