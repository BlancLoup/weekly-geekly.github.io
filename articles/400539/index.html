  <section class="page js-page"><h1>CES 2017: new year with new gadgets. News and expectations</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/406/b68/507/406b6850726e139b28a5ce8c00a64ae0.jpg" width="850"><br><br>  In refrigerators, citizens of most CIS countries (and Europe and the USA too) still have uneaten New Year‚Äôs and Christmas stocks of food, and citizens themselves did not have time to celebrate all the holidays that are supposed to be celebrated.  But in Las Vegas, not until the holidays.  Work is well underway here: participants of the international consumer electronics exhibition CES 2017 are demonstrating the merits of their gadgets.  There are a lot of companies that decided to take part in the exhibition this year: about one and a half thousand. <br><br>  If we take into account the fact that each company can show not one, but several new products, then you can be sure that this year we will have a huge number of gadgets, good and different.  It is clear that within the framework of several reviews we will not be able to cover all this.  But we do not set such goals for ourselves: in this and a couple of subsequent materials we will try to indicate only those gadgets that we found most interesting.  And, of course, we pay attention only to devices that correspond to the profile of our work.  Well, let's see what the developers offer us. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Yes, one moment - since there are a lot of gadgets, most of us were taken from the category ‚ÄúBest of Innovations‚Äù <a href="http://www.ces.tech/Events-Experiences/Innovation-Awards-Program/Honorees.aspx">from here</a> .  The remaining devices are what we believe may be useful for a wide range of users.  We repeat - we study only devices that are consistent with our field of activity, we did not consider laptops and other tablets, although there is also a lot of interesting things there.

      Soon we plan to post material about our personal impressions of CES visits - now we are on the way. <br><br><h3>  Companies and countries </h3><br>  Let's take a look at which companies from which countries at CES most.  As you can see, the United States and China are traditionally leading.  Why the USA is more or less clear, there are usually most technological startups here.  China is represented mostly by universal factories, which demonstrate devices from morally obsolete trends and trends.  However, there are exceptions, and there are a lot of them.  France, Israel and the Netherlands are countries with their own department of support for start-ups.  Here, the state takes care of its innovators, supporting them in every way. <br><br>  Unfortunately, there are very few representatives from Russia.  Why?  Our thoughts on this matter will be shared in one of the following materials. <br><br><div class="oembed"><twitter-widget class="twitter-tweet twitter-tweet-rendered" id="twitter-widget-0" style="position: absolute; visibility: hidden; display: block; transform: rotate(0deg); width: 500px; margin: 10px auto; max-width: 100%; min-width: 220px;" data-tweet-id="816266600789712896"></twitter-widget><blockquote class="twitter-tweet" align="center" data-twitter-extracted-i1551350246454556686="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">  Why so few UK exhibitors at CES 2017?  <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Tech%3Fsrc%3Dhash">#Tech</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Startup%3Fsrc%3Dhash">#Startup</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/CES2017%3Fsrc%3Dhash"># CES2017</a> <a href="https://t.co/UFrgEjkqZ1">https://t.co/UFrgEjkqZ1</a> <a href="https://t.co/30ORWrPMhT">pic.twitter.com/30ORWrPMhT</a> </p>  - Phil Spilsbury (@ philspil66) <a href="https://twitter.com/philspil66/status/816266600789712896">January 3, 2017</a> </blockquote><script async="" src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div><br><br>  Well, now let's talk about where we started, and what we plan to finish - with gadgets.  Devices are divided into several categories to make it easier for the reader. <br><br><h3>  Fitness devices and health </h3><br><h4>  Portable Air Quality Sensor Flow </h4><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/3fc/05d/eff/3fc05deff47c788ff7ef22065271498b.jpg" width="850"><br>  Plume Labs is not well known in the wearable device market.  Perhaps this will change soon: the developers of the startup have presented an interesting device, Flow, which is able to determine the quality of atmospheric air - both outdoors and indoors.  The device is able to determine the level of air pollution by car exhaust elements, dustiness and a number of other parameters, including humidity and temperature. <br><br>  The parameters collected by the sensor are sent to Plume Labs ‚Äúcloud‚Äù, where the air condition map in different parts of the world is formed with the help of a neural network.  This information is supplemented with data from 12 thousand meteorological stations located in 60 countries of the world.  If the air is very bad, the sensor will light a red LED.  In general, regions safe for living and traveling can be viewed on the map being formed. <br><br><h4>  K'Track G </h4><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/ebf/6cf/9fc/ebf6cf9fc90ebffd56d056c3c012614d.jpg" width="850"><br><br>  This wearable device is made in the form factor of a wristwatch.  It represents a tracker that allows people suffering from diabetes to monitor the dynamics of blood sugar levels in real time.  No blood samples are needed.  The advantage of K'Track G is that the user does not have to experience pain in order to determine the specified parameter once again. <br><br><h4>  Motiv ring </h4><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/f4a/4cd/c11/f4a4cdc11bd1cf71e6f0f8695d8d18f9.jpg" width="850"><br><br>  Motiv decided to create their own version of the smart ring.  Similar projects were implemented by several companies, but nothing good happened yet, the projects either died before the device entered the market, or devices started to be sold that did not correspond to what the developers had planned at the very beginning. <br><br>  Hopefully, the Motiv Ring is an exception to the rule.  This is a fitness tracker that is put on your finger.  It has everything that tracker users are used to (even the heart rate monitor), plus the original design.  The gadget is waterproof, it does not need to be removed, going into the water or bathing in the shower.  It is charged "through the air."  It looks quite a nothing, judging by the photos. <br><br><h4>  LINK AKC Smart Collar </h4><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/484/6de/654/4846de65485fa1ee4b0b6e4b84eeb42b.jpg" width="850"><br><br>  Who said that fitness gadgets should be only for people?  Animals deserve it too.  LINK AKC Smart Dog Collar is designed for dogs.  A clever collar keeps track of the pet's location.  In addition, it tracks the physical activity of the animal.  In general, the collar provides a more reliable connection between a person and his pet / animals - the developers claim that with this collar the dog can hardly get lost. <br><br><h4>  Polar T-Shirt Team Pro Shirt </h4><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/445/38b/359/44538b3595b0196a57f31c4fac3c3af9.jpg" width="850"><br><br>  The company Polar decided to release a new type of smart device, or rather a smart t-shirt.  Team Pro Shirt is equipped with a built-in heart rate sensor.  There are modules that monitor the speed of movement and the total distance traveled by man.  Of course, this system is fully compatible with the Polar software platform.  In addition, it is compatible with Team Pro, the training platform with which the most famous football clubs in the world work.  Owner of Team Pro Shirt, it is desirable to have available smart sports watch <a href="http://madrobots.ru/p/sportivnye-chasy-polar-v800-c-hrm-datchik-pulsa/">V800,</a> <a href="http://madrobots.ru/p/polar-m600/">M600</a> or <a href="http://madrobots.ru/p/sportivnye-chasy-s-gps-polar-m400/">M400</a> . <br><br><h4>  Smart Watch Withings Steel HR </h4><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/6a8/3ff/ddd/6a83ffdddafa754a86c2cf7ff6476ed5.jpg" width="850"><br><br>  The French company Withings was the first to launch a smart watch in the form factor of classical mechanics.  Now the developers have added to the capabilities of the previous model also the heart rate monitor.  The dial of the clock now houses a small LED display that shows the pulse and notifications about calendar events, messages, and missed calls. <br><br><h4>  BodyTrack Smart Headphones </h4><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/ba6/0bf/a0e/ba60bfa0e726eee1d60b3c223a6f9c2a.jpg" width="850"><br><br>  These headphones are designed by Inova Design.  They are attached to the ear shells and are capable, in addition to playing music and providing communication, to measure a large number of parameters of the wearer's body during exercise and at rest.  Among the other parameters that BodyTrack can measure are heart rate, body temperature, rhythm and speed of a person‚Äôs running or stride, as well as maximum oxygen consumption (VO2). <br><br>  Work with the smartphone is conducted by air, using Bluetooth. <br><br><h3>  Smart House </h3><br><h4>  Bracelet for secure user identification uBolt </h4><br>  In our time, the identification and authorization of users is a very important issue.  And not only in the case of visiting any secret and protected premises such as bank vaults.  Everything is simpler - systems like ‚Äúsmart‚Äù home should distinguish their owner / owners from other people, and do it with a high degree of reliability.  In addition, cyber security experts have long been saying that the authorization using the login / password bundle has long been outdated.  Therefore, biometric or multifactor authorization is considered as a potential alternative to passwords with logins. <br><br>  <a href="http://www.ces.tech/Events-Experiences/Innovation-Awards-Program/Honorees.aspx">The uBolt</a> is a wearable device that combines a fingerprint sensor, a voice sensor and several other elements that allow almost (nevertheless, the probability of a false response always exists) to accurately confirm the identity of the owner. <br><br><h4>  Smart mattress Sleep Number 360 </h4><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/c7a/b8c/f8e/c7ab8cf8ea6bbeed2b277d7b0ab9a0a7.jpg" width="850"><br><br>  Smart now can be not only refrigerators with cameras, but also mattresses.  Sleep Number 360 can adapt to the parameters and position of a person‚Äôs body, warms the wearer's feet if necessary, and also counteracts the snoring of the wearer.  No, it does not cover the mouth or nose, but simply raises the headboard.  Sleep Number 360 is compatible with a range of other smart devices.  Of course, an inexpensive device of this level can not be, but what to do - comfort requires money. <br><br><h4>  GeniCan Smart Bin </h4><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/b1c/ebb/4e1/b1cebb4e1fcfa725085ee381fa30bc5c.jpg" width="850"><br><br>  Here, ahead of the rest of the planet developers GeniCan.  This small fixture is attached to the bin and can read barcodes from packages that are thrown away.  Relevant application fixes what is thrown away and reminds the owner that you need to buy.  If the barcode is not present, the discarded object can be described by voice, GeniCan will understand. <br><br>  Plus, there is another unique feature - the smart trash can remind you that you need to empty it. <br><br><h4>  Kuri robot </h4><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/529/1b4/411/5291b4411bb41dd95d602421ce1b91b5.jpg" width="850"><br><br>  Electronic and mechanical human assistants are no longer so little.  Now one more has been added - this is the Kuri robot, which helps with the housework.  He is able to perform voice commands, manages home appliances, communicates with adults and children, shows emotions.  Able to the robot and perform the functions of a nanny. <br><br><h3>  Blink XT surveillance camera </h3><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/1a0/23b/2c8/1a023b2c8e46469134492291d0d45803.jpg" width="850"><br><br>  Two years - that is how much the new camera from Blink can work on two AA batteries.  Now Blink, which started two years ago with a campaign on Kickstarter, presented a full-fledged security system that is able to monitor any of the places in the house or apartment.  The waterproof and shockproof system can shoot video as 1080p, equipped with a motion detector and night vision system.  At CES2017, this device was presented, which immediately attracted the attention of visitors. <br><br><h4>  POWERbot VR7000 Robot Vacuum Cleaner from Samsung </h4><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/391/b7b/67d/391b7b67d91b267bee84453a89933c4a.jpg" width="850"><br><br>  Samsung produces a wide variety of gadgets.  The company does not shy away from work with vacuum cleaners, including robotized ones.  At CES, Koreans brought with them the newest robot vacuum cleaner POWERbot VR7000.  According to the developers, it is thinner than previous models, but more powerful.  In addition, the robot can climb into the most inaccessible places, and clean everything thoroughly.  The system is equipped with a large number of various sensors and sensors, thanks to which the robot vacuum cleaner perfectly orientates itself in space.  The force with which the vacuum cleaner sucks air varies depending on which surface the device is currently working on.  The POWERbot VR7000 has its own application for mobile devices, so that the vacuum cleaner can be controlled from a smartphone or tablet. <br><br><h4>  Zera Food Recycler </h4><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/482/6de/b62/4826deb62dc8dd1d8ae9a8a7bb6709e5.jpg" width="850"><br><br>  An interesting device that is useful to those users who have plants at home.  It recycles food waste into fertilizer.  Recycling into fertilizer takes about a week (about 3.5 organic waste). <br><br><h3>  Audio systems </h3><br><h4>  LG's Levitating Bluetooth Speaker </h4><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/896/582/244/89658224425bc2a9dff87777d54e5482.jpg" width="850"><br><br>  LG called its gadget very simple: Levitating Portable Speaker.  And this name fully reflects the essence of the device.  We have already published some material about various levitating devices, and this device is a worthy addition to the ‚Äúflying gadgets‚Äù category.  As in all other cases, the secret of flight here is in magnetic induction.  The company promises to play sound in all directions, while working offline - 10 hours. <br><br>  By the way, the speaker is protected from external factors according to the IPX7 standard, so you can listen to music not only in the house, but also on the street, even if it rains.  As soon as the battery runs out of energy, the device slowly lowers to the docking station and charges. <br><br><h4>  Ashley Chloe Fuse Modular Wireless Headphones </h4><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/242/1a7/85d/2421a785d3d0dcfb661dd315eac9d4f3.jpg" width="850"><br><br>  Very unusual wireless ceramic headphones that provide high quality sound.  You can control the functions of the system using the touch surface.  The developers have released their own application for Fuse, which is associated with the company's cloud neural network.  Headphones can be embedded in a pendant and two types of bracelets that serve as charging devices at the same time.  As far as can be judged, bracelets are just a piece of jewelry, which, as indicated above, charges headphones while wearing.  So the system will be available for use anytime and anywhere. <br><br><h4>  ReSound ENZO2 </h4><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/cd4/7d3/553/cd47d355329b387b379f9901d2e621bb.jpg" width="850"><br><br>  This system is a smart hearing aid that can work as a headphone as well as a hands free.  Optimized device for iPhone. <br><br>  So far this is only a small fraction of those devices that have already been presented, or will be presented in the next couple of days.  We hope that most of these gadgets will get to the market, and then they can be tested in the work personally. <br><br><h4>  Lenovo Smart Assistant </h4><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/57c/037/fcb/57c037fcb33154c61e6c8344872be6a2.png" width="850"><br><br>  Lenovo has decided to create its own column - a virtual assistant.  This is not a competitor to Alexa from Amazon, we can say that this is just an improved version.  The system has two speakers that sound louder than the Echo.  Actually, the novelty is not very much, a simple improvement. <br><br><h3>  What else to expect from CES </h3><br>  Yes, a lot of things.  We will mention something, something will pass by our (and not only our) attention.  One thing is clear: the emphasis is now being made by developers on such categories as: <br><ul><li>  Smart House; </li><li>  Car gadgets and control systems; </li><li>  Virtual reality (below is an example of what awaits us in the near future) </li><li>  Drones and robots; </li><li>  Wearable electronics (where do without it); </li><li>  Artificial Intelligence; </li><li>  Wireless acoustics; </li><li>  Large TVs; </li><li>  Smartphones (here, however, it is difficult to expect something very much innovative). </li></ul><br>  We at Madrobots will keep track of new items, trying not to miss the most interesting.  Well and, of course, share finds with readers on Geektimes.  Soon, some of the devices presented at CES will appear with us.  We will report this additionally. <br><br> <a href="http://madrobots.ru/%3Futm_source%3Dgeektimes.ru%26utm_medium%3Dpr%26utm_campaign%3Dces_first"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/d29/4c3/07d/d294c307dde04335ac3f425e73b36a7a.gif"></a> <br> <a href="http://madrobots.ru/about/mails/%3Futm_source%3Dgeektimes.ru%26utm_medium%3Dpr%26utm_campaign%3Dces_first"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/7fa/417/fe3/7fa417fe3d464fa5aa186b1ab30da53a.gif"></a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/400539/">https://habr.com/ru/post/400539/</a></p>
