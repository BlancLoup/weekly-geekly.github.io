Tests are conducted in the city of Reutov. <br><br>  Reuters journalists have a protocol meeting of the commission with a report on the results of testing new technologies.  So, the test is quite extensive, not just one, but several traffic filtering systems are being tested in Reutov, including the products of RDP.RU, ADM Systems, NTC Proteus, DDoS-Guard, Napa Labs, Vas Experts and Concern Automatics, which is part of Rostec State Corporation . <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Anton Pinchuk, co-owner of one of the companies, who refused to participate in the development of a traffic filtering system, gave his comment on the reality of what is happening: ‚ÄúThe task was ambitious, and the time for preparation was very short.  As part of testing on the Rostelecom network from DPI, they wanted to recognize and block virtually all known network protocols on the channel at more than 1 Tbit / s.  Our DPI successfully works on the networks of many telecom operators, but for more specific tasks. ‚Äù

      He also stated that the company did not receive specific commercial offers from Roskomnadzor.  Nevertheless, Pinchuk knows the basic idea that underlies the current project.  It is to find the most effective solution for analyzing, filtering and blocking traffic, which could be equipped with networks of operators throughout the country. <br><br>  As for Rostelecom, the state corporation declined to comment: ‚ÄúThe press service of Roskomnadzor has no information on this issue.‚Äù <br><br>  Sources who are aware of what is happening, argue that according to the results of tests Roskomnadzor and the FSB plan to choose the best system.  After this, a task will be given to refine it, if necessary.  After that, the implementation of the system will begin in the infrastructure of all telecom operators in Russia.  The goal is to block prohibited content on the Internet as efficiently as possible. <br><br>  The tests were originally supposed to end on August 20th, but the testing periods were extended.  As it turned out, the first systems failed to pass the tests, and the time limits for testing others were postponed.  The tests were unsuccessful because the developers tried to block the MTProto protocol, which is used to encrypt messages in the Telegram messenger, and SOCKS to block the messenger.  But as a result, it turned out that blocking closes access to resources that are quite popular in the Russian Federation, for example, the Sberbank Online service. <br><br>  The fact is that the Telegram for the transmission of one message is enough just one network packet.  But none of the tested systems are able to recognize the package by identifying the messenger.  The package itself is ‚Äúdisguised‚Äù now under https, then under antivirus data, therefore the traffic filtering systems are simply not able to block the messenger, without affecting the channels of other resources and services. <br><br>  ‚ÄúWe will leave unanswered questions about the very fact of testing, as part of our interaction with Roskomnadzor, we perform a number of tests and, for some, we do not have the right to disclose information,‚Äù said Vas Experts Deputy Director General Alexey Alekseenko.  He also added that blocking Telegram-related protocols disrupts banking clients. <br><br>  According to Alekseenko, the solution of his company, SCAT, allows you to select and block not only Telegram, but also other messengers, including Whatsapp, Viber, Facebook Messenger.  But since the messengers began to use the MTProto and SOCKS server technologies, it is difficult to block them.  The reason is that blocking general communication protocols leads to disruption of a wide range of applications, including ‚Äúwhite‚Äù ones. <br><br>  It is worth recalling that Telegram entered the register of prohibited resources in Russia in April 2018.  Then the company announced its refusal to provide the FSB with the keys to decrypt the correspondence of its users.  After that, Roskomnadzor appealed to the Tagansky Court of Moscow with a claim to block the message service.  This claim was soon satisfied, after which Roskomnadzor began work on blocking the messenger. <br><br>  Telecom operators for several weeks tried to block the IP subnet of networks that are somehow related to Telegram.  As a result, the total amount of blocked IP reached 17 million, but Roskomnadzor did not reach its goal.  Moreover, after the start of blocking the messenger, many sites and services that worked on the basis of the cloud platforms of Google, Amazon and others stopped working normally. <br><br><blockquote>  <b>A warning at the request of the site administration:</b> ‚ÄúWhen commenting on this material, please follow the rules.
