  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Online store: work on the bugs</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  There is a mistaken opinion that it is enough to create an online store and the money will flow in a stream.  But alas, it is not.  The development of an online store is a permanent job, in particular work on the bugs.  What errors are most common?  Let's figure it out together. <a name="habracut"></a><br><br><h4>  Product unsuitable for email.  commerce </h4><br>  Probably the most frequent mistake when creating an online store is the wrong choice of goods, i.e.  selection of goods that are not suitable for email.  Commerce: <ul><li>  cheap goods (the price of goods is less than the price of delivery); </li><li>  defective goods; </li><li>  a specific product (for example, a wedding dress); </li><li>  public goods (if you do not create an additional motivation to buy via the Internet); </li><li>  goods that you need to measure, try, smell, etc.  before buying (especially when first buying); </li><li>  a product that is forbidden to sell over the Internet (in many countries, for example, alcohol). </li><li>  other products that you can write in the comments. </li></ul>  If you see that the product for some reason is not for sale or is not sold as you would like, think whether you have chosen the product for sale correctly.  The sooner you realize that the selected product for sales is not true, the less money and time you will lose.  In order to understand whether the choice of goods is correct, watch the statistics (sales, conversion, number of visits, etc.), conduct surveys and monitor the market, watch the competitors (if a competitor for some reason removed the product from his Internet store, it is worth thinking about the reasons). <br><br><h4>  Process optimization </h4><br>  Standing still leads to "death."  It is quite possible that at some particular point in time everything seems fine: there are many customers, it suits customers, etc.  But things can change very quickly.  Competitors are not standing still, they are looking for new ways to achieve their main goals: increase in conversion, amount of order, number of visits of potential buyers, i.e.  in simple terms, increasing profits.  Therefore, in order not to remain "overboard" at some point, constant work is needed on optimization (for example, improving logistics, accounting, the online store itself).

    <h4>  Delivery errors </h4><br>  Courier "face" of your online store, and delivery - one of the most important components of any online store.  Therefore it is recommended to constantly monitor the delivery based parameters: speed, price, human factor (for example, courier tidiness and politeness) and, of course, the type of goods delivered (believe me, no one wants to see a battered or soiled box with goods).  Regardless of whether you hire a delivery service, have your couriers, or send mail, you should be aware of the quality of delivery.  And who besides the buyers themselves will tell you all the truth?  You just need to ask them. <br><br><h4>  Lack of information and lack of preparedness of consultants </h4><br>  When buying, every buyer wants to know the price and characteristics of the goods, the speed and price of delivery, the possibility to return the goods, warranty obligations from the seller, so the online store system should inform the buyer all the necessary information not only on the online store page, but also by email  mail or when communicating by phone. <br><br>  Check if there is enough information.  Most often, users are looking for and want to see: <br><ul><li>  Help or Frequently Asked Questions; </li><li>  contacts and details of the online store; </li><li>  current product information; </li><li>  detailed information about the product; </li><li>  great quality photos; </li><li>  links to the official website of the manufacturer; </li><li>  similar products; </li><li>  popular goods; </li><li>  only those products that are in stock; </li><li>  related products (for example, if a customer buys a printer, then he wants to see offers with paper and cassettes for the printer; </li></ul><br><h4>  Lack of fame among potential buyers </h4><br>  Advertising!  Advertising!  and again Advertisement! <br>  The online store makes a profit at the expense of customers, and in order to attract customers you need targeted advertising.  And this must not be forgotten.  Ways to attract customers: <ul><li>  optimization of an online store for search engines; </li><li>  advertising through traditional and Internet channels; </li><li>  forums, newsletters; </li><li>  social networks; </li><li>  exhibitions, conferences, seminars, etc. </li></ul><br><h4>  Wrong choice of partners </h4><br>  Not only from yourself, but also the success of your email depends on the chosen partners.  store.  If you are not satisfied with the quality of the services of your partners, let them know immediately, ‚Äúdo not pull the rubber‚Äù, your profit depends on them, therefore you have every right to demand improvement of the services.  If you can not agree, change partners.  The main criteria for choosing a new partner: <br><ul><li>  experience and competence in the chosen field; </li><li>  quality and quantity of human resources; </li><li>  flexibility; </li><li>  network of contacts; </li><li>  caliper quality; </li><li>  availability of additional services. </li></ul><br><h4>  Incorrect design and inconvenience of using the online store and system </h4><br>  Someone on Habr√© wrote that the design and convenience of an online store does not sell.  This is true, however, the design and (in) convenience of the online store should not interfere with the purchase.  The design should be simple, aimed at selling the product (i.e., the design should help to make goods, there should be <i>call-to-action</i> everywhere), to fit the audience of customers, without unnecessary animation and sounds. <br><br>  Do not forget that not only the store should be convenient, but also the administration system and other other related systems. <br><br><h4>  Instead of conclusion </h4><br>  In the end, I would like to advise one thing - be constantly aware of what customers are saying about you and then working on the bugs will be easier. <br><br>  PS As you add comments, I will update the topic. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/92810/">https://habr.com/ru/post/92810/</a></p>
