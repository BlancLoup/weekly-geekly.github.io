Digital Index 2015 rating</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  <a href="http://www.adindex.ru/">AdIndex</a> conducted a study of Russian PR, advertising and digital agencies.  Its result was the Digital Index 2015 rating. The criteria were taken by the levels of awareness of agencies among customers, the market share of players from the experience of confirmed cooperation and expert assessments of the quality and effectiveness of cooperation with companies. <br><br>  AdIndex specialists have figured out how advertisers evaluate the state of different segments, what they see as the main problems, and which claims are most often presented to contractors.  And the average market valuation has become the criterion for the formation of a pool of recommended contractors (who received ratings above the market average). <br><br>  The researchers also surveyed clients of digital agencies and asked them to answer the following questions:

      ‚Ä¢ How to choose a contractor for online campaigns? <br>  ‚Ä¢ To whom to go for flexible prices, and to whom for impeccable customer service? <br>  ‚Ä¢ Who is the best of the best in expertise? <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  Analysts have formed ratings of knowledge, cooperation and satisfaction with cooperation in 12 examinations: <br><br>  1. Media banner advertising <br>  2. Media Video Advertising <br>  3. Contextual advertising <br>  4. SEO <br>  5. Digital Creative Service <br>  6. Web Production / Support <br>  7. Mobile Production <br>  8. Digital PR / SMM <br>  9. Lead generation <br>  10. Programmatic Buying <br>  11. Direct Marketing <br>  12. Mobile Marketing <br><br>  AdIndex notes a non-commercial approach to ranking and openness to all market participants.  As before, the rating was based on a survey of advertisers.  Customers were invited to name (with a hint) all contractors known to them in various disciplines: the purchase of online media advertising (banners, pop-up windows and other similar formats);  placement of contextual advertising (commercial links in search results and on specialized resources);  development and implementation of advertising campaigns on the Internet and so on.  Then it was necessary to indicate the agencies with which they had collaborated over the past three years, and to assess the quality of services and pricing. <br><br>  Experts from the following companies were invited to the study: <br><br>  1. Top 1000 largest buyers of display advertising on the Internet <br>  2. Top 1000 total advertising costs (AdIndex score based on TNS monitoring) <br>  3. Companies whose presence on the Internet irrefutably proves the proper level of digital expertise. <br><br>  Since the most accessible and obvious metrics are pages on the Internet (sites), this side of the question was studied and its own opinion was drawn up about the advisability of inviting certain specialists to the survey.  As a result, about 400 respondents had to be rejected, since the level of work done under their leadership or their efforts would not make their voice meaningful for the market.  As a result, 3300 experts were invited to the study, AdIndex <a href="http://www.adindex.ru/news/agencies/2015/11/24/130197.phtml">writes</a> . <br><br>  Based on the responses received, the ratings of the induced knowledge (knowledge with a hint) and cooperation were formed.  Customer ratings formed the basis of a satisfaction rating for cooperation (quality rating).  It included agencies whose opinion on the service was expressed by at least 2% of experts using the service. <br><br>  On the AdIndex website in the public domain only the overall rating for the quality of service is given.  Ratings of knowledge and cooperation will be published on Tuesday, December 1. <br><br><h4>  Satisfaction Leaders </h4><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/999/eff/cfa/999effcfaf6643ccbff0fb79349221b8.png"><br><br>  A more detailed table with comments is available <a href="http://adindex.ru/rating3/digital/129949/index.phtml">here</a> . </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/296854/">https://habr.com/ru/post/296854/</a></p>
