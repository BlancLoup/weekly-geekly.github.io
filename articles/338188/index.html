The desire to minimize costs and maximize profits often leads to rash actions.  Therefore, in order not to break away from reality, Ivideon uses its own products along with our users.  New cameras, service updates, video analytics - all this is checked by employees, works on a full-fledged basis inside the office and shops. <br><br>  At the beginning of the year, we did a joint <a href="https://geektimes.ru/company/ivideon/blog/285948/">project with David Yan and iiko</a> , linking the video surveillance service to cash transactions in restaurants.  Now you can watch a video of a suspicious event at the box office directly in your Ivideon account.  For example, you saw the cancellation of the check and want to know the reason.  Iiko was pleased with the cooperation and offered video surveillance as a pre-service to its customers.

      But we were left with a feeling of easy dissatisfaction - for the first time we could not use our own product ourselves.  Ivideon does not yet have a restaurant.  But we have a network of stores.  And then the idea came: what's the difference, a restaurant, a house of a book or a camera shop?  The main thing is the availability of cash.  Our stores operate at 1C (as well as a third of enterprises throughout the country), so we decided to make friends with the video surveillance service with the 1C: Enterprise automation system. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h2>  What we did </h2><br>  Integration with iiko showed all the advantages of communication video surveillance and automation systems.  We wanted to achieve a similar effect for our own stores - i.e.  control any operational event in business processes by video data.  For example, check data such as: <br><br>  ‚óè opening a new check; <br>  ‚óè changes in price or quantity of goods; <br>  ‚óè use or cancel discount; <br>  ‚óè cancellation of the check; <br>  ‚óè shipping invoice; <br>  ‚óè receiving goods, etc. <br><br>  When checking, the occurrence of controversial situations or customer complaints, it is enough to find the desired receipt / event and look at the video recordings of the cashier‚Äôs actions.  The video surveillance system records the cash areas with several cameras.  All the resulting image is recorded in the archive and can be viewed later in real time. <br><br>  Assuming that if integration with 1C works for us, then others will like it, we decided to add another reinforced concrete argument to the foundation of the solution - we didn‚Äôt want to build a complex module, write a three-dimensional solution, attract a dozen developers and thereby increase the development cost to beyond the clouds heights <br><br>  It is necessary not only to control the cash registers, monitor the integrity of the working staff, or facilitate the resolution of conflicts.  Integration should be easy, simple and accessible - not only for us, but also, perhaps, for every store in Russia. <br><br>  For a couple of months we got our plans. <br><br><h2>  Integration with 1C </h2><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/80e/e17/9dc/80ee179dc6d949c78e48904f59cf096d.png" alt="image"><br><br>  We made a module for integration with any 1C product based on 1C 8.3 platform (integration with earlier versions is possible, but will require customization with the involvement of 1C programmer).  That allows you to get a video of any operational events in business processes (breaking a check, shipping invoice, receiving goods, etc.). <br><br>  The solution turned out to be simple, affordable and easy to configure by the user (without the involvement of programmers).  Our integration is universal, but only monitors events at the object record level in 1C.  For a more complex event fixation (price change in the document, opening a cash drawer, etc.), additional customization is needed by an outside programmer 1C. <br><br>  In our solution, we do not make any changes to the objects of the main configuration of 1C.  Thus, typical 1C configurations do not fly off the automatic update. <br><br>  The wiring diagram is very simple.  It is necessary to download external processing for 1C 8.3 <a href="https://ru.ivideon.com/ivideon-1c-integration/">from the Ivideon website</a> (at the bottom of the page).  Installation and configuration of the module can be carried out according to the instructions of the 1C user without the involvement of a programmer. <br><br>  The user marks on 1C a record of which configuration objects (directories, documents) he wants to record in Ivideon. <br><br>  It looks like this: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/304/5cc/232/3045cc232ce94096b4a910c4df48bd5b.png" alt="image"><br><br>  The camera can be tied to a specific analytics object (user in 1C, warehouse, cash, etc.): <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/663/05b/2ea/66305b2ea17844aa8ddc3508b906d4c2.png" alt="image"><br><br>  In processing there is a universal filter for objects, dates and analytics (for example: show all receipts for the period by warehouse1 in which there is a product2, punched by a cashier3): <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/739/e62/160/739e62160cd440b3aff83cdbce7a2b84.png" alt="image"><br><br>  To get the video, just press one button.  The request is sent to the Ivideon cloud to receive video from the archive by the date and time of the required document from 1C.  The video is displayed through the video player on 1C form: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/ece/e19/c47/ecee19c47a1d4c81ba7e06498678ca9e.png" alt="image"><br><br>  In more detail you can evaluate the work on the screencast. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/sXoLkVMcfgQ" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br><h2>  Where to use </h2><br>  <b>Camera above the cash register.</b>  Watch videos of check printing events and identify suspicious transactions.  For example, orders greater than a certain amount or orders with large discounts.  Record the opening and closing events of the cashier shift.  Promptly resolve disputes and incidents with shortages. <br><br>  <b>The camera at the point of delivery of goods</b> .  Watch the video of the issuance of goods to the client, the preparation of goods for shipment to the client.  Filter suspicious non-standard orders and get the opportunity to detect employee errors (cancel operations, repeat operations).  Find the reason for the shortage in stock.  See if the customer has been given the goods specified in the order. <br><br>  <b>The camera at the point of return / service center</b> .  Quickly find the video of the client‚Äôs communication with the employee in case of client‚Äôs complaints.  Get the opportunity to verify the correctness of compliance with the rules of the return procedure.  Combine video surveillance system and warehouse management system. <br><br>  <b>The camera is in stock</b> .  Visually track the entire assembly path of the order in the address warehouse, and identify an error in the configuration.  Track all operations for a specific storekeeper, determine suspicious transactions, and evaluate the effectiveness of the work. <br><br>  And this is only part of the possible situations. <br><br>  We have covered several cases in more detail in the video. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/cmJA1L-kMEk" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br>  Error issuing goods. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ZrHf1oDvs3w" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br>  Fraud by the seller who offers a discount. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/V9y1OjMFgLU" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br>  Scam with passes at the entrance. <br><br><h2>  What you need to work </h2><br>  In addition to 1C - <a href="https://ru.ivideon.com/shop/">video surveillance system</a> .  We are not tied to specific requirements, it is not necessary to install only Ivideon cameras.  It is enough to connect the existing cameras through the program Ivideon Server. <br><br>  Our integration is a flexible solution that can be deployed anywhere without staff training, complex settings, and a confusing implementation process.  At the same time, we have achieved high resiliency and reliability, without affecting the functionality of 1C.  All questions on the system can be solved remotely. <br><br>  Since it works through our cloud, no maintenance of user hardware, complexity, and resource consumption is required.  The module is not picky and stable.  The interface does not look like hell, where you have text superimposed on the image, as a result of which you cannot read the text or see what happens there on the frame. <br><br>  <a href="https://drive.google.com/open%3Fid%3D0ByoCkDdJQTuMdnRrNzJQNjNyQ3c">Download a free module</a> for integration with any 1C product based on 1C 8.3 platform. <br><br>  If you do not have cameras or you want to connect the integration between 1C and your cameras (and did not figure out how to do it) - call 8 (800) 555 42 97 (from 9 to 18 in Moscow, the call is free).
