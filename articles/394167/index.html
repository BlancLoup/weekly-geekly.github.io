The fact is that earlier, experts discovered this defect and eliminated it on all cables produced at the plant according to automation, RIA Novosti reports.  But the cable in which the defect was detected remained defective and was sent to the cosmodrome.

      ‚ÄúOne of the employees of the enterprise for automation found this defect, reported to her management, then reported upstairs, the design defect was eliminated.  But, oddly enough, it was eliminated on all cables, except the one on which it was detected.  And this cable, this is a mystical situation, was sent to a lettered rocket, for which everyone had to answer with the head, and the tests, it was noted, were carried out, ‚ÄùRogozin said. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  He also said that all the documentation for testing the missile system was correct, there were no errors in the documents.  The tests themselves passed in full compliance with the standards.  In addition, according to Rogozin, the defect could not be detected directly in the rocket.  ‚ÄúBecause this defect belongs to the category of those that are detected only during start-up when the first cartridge opens, which opens the valve,‚Äù the vice-premier commented on the situation. <br><br>  ‚ÄúTherefore, it is possible to refer many times to the fact that launches are often delayed.  Indeed, in the Russian Federation, the number of deferred launches is much less than in the United States of America.  It's true.  And this is not an emergency.  And this is not an incident even.  This is the usual regular situation when the automatics shows a delayed start-up, ‚ÄùRogozin said. <br><br>  Let me remind you that the launch of the Suz-2.1a launch vehicle took place on April 28.  Prior to this, the launch was postponed for a day due to a defective cable, which caused the automatic launch cancellation to occur. <br><br>  The vice-premier said that launch problems are a ‚Äúserious lesson‚Äù, but no one will be punished for what happened.  Here it is extremely important not to wave a cudgel and not to clean up people, even if they are aged, but who are carriers of a certain school.  We are now not to fat.  We have few specialists now, ‚Äùhe said. <br><br>  It became known earlier that after the launch failure, Russian President Vladimir Putin reprimanded Rogozin and the head of Roscosmos Igor Komarov, and also issued a resolution on incomplete official compliance with the general director of the NPO Automation Leonid Shalimov.  After that, Leonid Shalimov was removed from work by the Deputy Prime Minister and resigned after some time. <br><br>  Rogozin also called the cost of the space center - according to him, the cost of the entire project is 84 billion rubles, which is less than in the case of any other similar project in the world. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/394167/">https://habr.com/ru/post/394167/</a></p>
