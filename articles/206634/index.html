On December 1 of this year, the sequel went on sale - MegaFon Login 2, a company that was made by the Optima model - with a slightly larger screen, but just as affordable;  and MegaFon Login 2 tablet. As well as MegaFon 4G Turbo with a 4.5 "display and LTE - the cheapest 4G smartphone on the market in Russia, according to the company J`son &amp; Partners. All four devices are candidates for New Year's sales - in today's review. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Let's start with a small presentation of the participants: <br><br><h5>  MegaFon Login 2 </h5><br>  <b>Display:</b> 3.5 ", 320x480, capacitive <br>  <b>Dimensions and weight:</b> 119.9x62.5x12.5 mm, 112 g <br>  <b>Processor:</b> Dual-core, 1 GHz, MediaTek MT6572M <br>  <b>Memory:</b> 512 MB RAM, 4 GB ROM, microSD support up to 32 GB <br>  <b>Camera:</b> 3.2 MP;  front camera 0.3 MP <br>  <b>OS:</b> Android 4.2 <br>  <b>Internet:</b> 3G <br>  <b>Battery:</b> Li-ion 1500 mAh <br>  <b>Price:</b> with simultaneous connection of the ‚ÄúInternet XS‚Äù option - 1990 rubles;  without connection - 2990 rubles.

And also - with a large display, slim body and a powerful processor. <br><br><h5>  Tablet MegaFon Login 2 </h5><br>  <b>Display:</b> 7 ", 1024x600 <br>  <b>Dimensions and weight:</b> 197.6x122x11.8 mm, 350 g <br>  <b>Processor:</b> Dual-core, 1 GHz Qualcomm MSM8225 <br>  <b>Memory:</b> RAM 512 MB, ROM 4 GB, microSD support up to 32 GB <br>  <b>Camera:</b> 3 MP, front 0.3 MP <br>  <b>OS:</b> Android 4.1 <br>  <b>Internet:</b> 3G <br>  <b>Battery:</b> Li-ion 3000 mAh <br>  <b>Price:</b> 2990 p.  + tariff option "Internet S" (780 p.) <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/aad/3ad/a37/aad3ada37055bbe09dad7c2f6dd70e5e.jpg"><br><br>  A full tablet for less than $ 100?  Definitely, I love progress!  At the same time, Login 2 is not even the cheapest seven-inch tablet, but one of the most balanced in terms of price / quality in its niche. <br><br><h4>  Design </h4><br>  There is no need to talk about a single style of MegaFon devices - rather, they are some kind of averaged ‚Äújust smart phones‚Äù.  More or less stands out except that 4G Turbo - a full face device resembles old iPhones due to the shape of a rectangle with rounded corners and a metal edging around the perimeter. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/fb6/7b0/131/fb67b01310b007af9321df5f548c2e1a.jpg"><br><br>  When viewed in profile, this impression disappears - the back cover has a significant protrusion in the upper part, where the camera is located and where the SIM and microSD cards are ‚Äúcharged‚Äù. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/ea7/690/88d/ea769088d75c065fd3bf2360f6805267.jpg"><br><br>  This is the thinnest device among all the devices in the review: apart from this ‚Äúshelf‚Äù of relief, the body (in the part that the user is holding with a hand) is only 8.8 mm thick.  ‚ÄúWaist‚Äù, screen 4.5 "and, of course, the presence of LTE translate 4G Turbo into the first division of budget smartphones, quite capable of being compared to devices already in the middle price category. Its design can also be considered the most functional - in the entire line of devices only 4G Turbo There is a hardware camera button. <br><br>  The most harmonious look is different, perhaps, 4-inch Optima rounded on all sides.  Thickness 12 mm - within normal limits.  Contrasting keys for volume and power, as well as the edging of the camera‚Äôs ‚Äúeye‚Äù and microUSB connector complete the image of a youth gadget. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/c3a/ff2/180/c3aff21809c8d03924915850e402907c.jpg"><br><br>  Optima and Login 2 smartphones are distinguished by the presence of the ‚ÄúMenu‚Äù, ‚ÄúBack‚Äù and ‚ÄúHome‚Äù touch keys.  However, in terms of ergonomics, this is a fat plus. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/7df/6c3/1c5/7df6c31c50bb8671da052a8412bc56f2.jpg"><br><br>  On 4G Turbo and the Login 2 tablet, these keys are already completely virtual ‚Äî less convenient, but it allows devices to be made smaller. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/009/a01/5c8/009a015c87d0decb696cc41ecf9e3015.jpg"><br><br><h4>  Iron </h4><br>  Obviously, there are no miracles - in order for smartphones to be so cheap, developers needed to save money.  But it‚Äôs stupid to approach smartphones for 2000 rubles with the same requirements as for top-end gadgets.  The market of budget devices lives by its own rules.  Reading the reviews are not journalists, but the buyers of these and other budget smarts themselves, I drew attention to the fact that the basic requirements for them are quite simple: for the toys to go and there was a good build quality.  Build a budget gadget that meets these requirements - the problem is quite solvable, and the developer - the electronic giant ZTE Corporation - coped with it. <br><br>  The first evidence of saving is memory.  512 MB of RAM is not enough even for a budget smartphone.  Saving on the internal memory is not so critical - let only Login 2 and Optima on both of 4 GB, of which 3 gigabytes are occupied by the system, and the user only has a gig, but the microSD card connectors compensate for this with interest.  And the owner of 4G Turbo and they will not be needed (although there is also support for microSD), because  Smartphone's own memory is 16 GB.  On processors, savings are not evident: the minimum time requirements - such as dual-core processors with a frequency of at least 1 GHz - are met. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/7fe/1ed/15f/7fe1ed15f08986ddfd9455260c873dd9.jpg"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/14c/ad3/265/14cad3265094329a5b29a9c49a004ca9.jpg"><br>  Login 2 |  Login 2 smartphone <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/393/1c7/280/3931c7280ab6d4577a47c819dcee581e.jpg"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/47d/417/453/47d4174535f13021eb5323b9e4b2d062.jpg"><br>  Optima |  4G Turbo <br><br>  Another savings from the category of "not sorry" - the quality of external speakers.  The sound in them sometimes groans in the spirit of old computer speakers - from those that were sold once for 200 rubles.  ‚ÄúIt's not a pity‚Äù - because hardly anyone uses their smartphones or tablets as a music center.  And the sound quality in the "ears" depends more on the headphone model.  At least, while listening to music from <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/megafon/blog/202262/">iPad Air</a> or from MegaFon Login 2, I paid no attention to the difference. <br><br>  3.5 mm audio outputs on smartphones are located on the top, on the tablet - on the bottom.  The latter is a solution that is as non-standard (although it was once customary) as it is convenient. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/ee3/cf9/0bc/ee3cf90bc9d319248b9df0e2f7f3e3c6.jpg"><br><br>  Another noteworthy fact is the standard connectors for SIM cards: no micro or, God forbid, nano.  Presumably, this is also a factor in reducing the cost of development.  However, they didn‚Äôt save on quality: smartphones are collected on the conscience, there is no backlash and creaking on all gadgets - everything is very reliable, which is especially important for the budget segment. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/dd9/3c3/f26/dd93c3f263f08d920838885ff8dee723.jpg"><br><br>  The power buttons on smartphones are also on top, but the microUSB connector on all four gadgets is located differently, and on the tablet and 4G Turbo, besides, ‚Äúupside down‚Äù - presumably, there is no talk of any common platform. <br><br>  In general, all four devices deal with the task of being an efficient and reliable handheld computer well, and for their price, it is brilliant at all. <br><br><h4>  Soft </h4><br>  From the comparison of the characteristics it is clear that the Android versions on the devices are going along with each other - from Android 4.04.  on MegaFon 4G Turbo to 4.2.2 on Optima and Login 2 smartphone. However, the difference between them is rather cosmetic - I don‚Äôt think that Habr is the place to seriously discuss the difference between screen unlock options. <br><br>  When first turned on, MegaFon's corporate jingle sounds, familiar from the company's commercials.  The setup procedure is standard for any Android.  The shell is the advantage of low-end smartphones - almost naked Android, in which all the applications of MegaFon are added - including <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/megafon/blog/193392/">MultiFon</a> , navigation, GetUpps!  and so on.  MegaFon Optima stands out a bit, modified Android 4.2 on which it got the name DNA Lancher: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/85e/9d4/b2c/85e9d4b2c76395b78f559d4b5d2a56a0.png"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/2cd/007/2b3/2cd0072b3a40a9cb33902499fcd3d078.png"><br><br>  At the same time, everything is very democratic: applications can be safely removed - they are not tightly sewn (unlike, in fact, Google‚Äôs app). <br><br><h4>  the Internet </h4><br>  In quite a predictable way, a smartphone with LTE is tearing and throwing: the results of the MegaFon 4G Turbo speed tests are more than an order of magnitude ahead of the measurements of 3G counterparts. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/32f/4e1/a18/32f4e1a188d5c903c50527f4acf0fc31.jpg"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/6e0/1a5/cad/6e01a5cad6973e7bd72d1185c51bf150.jpg"><br><br>  4G Turbo |  Login 2 <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/323/c0e/a57/323c0ea578e1fbb11b05ffad5d9cbaba.jpg"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/113/70a/4ca/11370a4ca1c0b99c2dd9bc53f1f4193c.jpg"><br><br>  Optima |  Login 2 (tablet) <br><br>  One of the reasons, besides the natural advantages of the standard, as I <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/megafon/blog/190064/">once wrote</a> , is that LTE devices are still less common, while MegaFon‚Äôs 4G network is fully deployed - in other words, there is no one to plug channels, unlike 3G so the moment needs to be caught right now. <br><br><h4>  Christmas unpacking </h4><br>  Pre-New Year review of gadgets suggests that it will be read, implying the choice of a gift.  However, the complete set of all devices without surprises: along with smartphones - a microUSB adapter to USB, a charger and unpretentious "ears."  Included with the tablet Login 2 - only an adapter and charging, but what is in itself a gift - a tablet <a href="http://moscow.shop.megafon.ru/modems_g__g_33_tree_1030_83453.html">for 2990 p</a> .  (the ‚ÄúInternet XS‚Äù option, which allows you to purchase a smartphone at the specified discount price, is purchased separately and is charged for 1-4 months depending on the region).  MegaFon 4G Turbo is <a href="">the cheapest 4G smartphone on the market</a> , with the best hardware among the survey participants with 16 GB of memory on board - the best choice <a href="http://moscow.shop.megafon.ru/modems_g__g_33_tree_985_81673.html">for 4,990 p</a> .  However, for the same money, you can take two smartphones at once: Login 2 <a href="http://moscow.shop.megafon.ru/mobile_g__g_1_tree_7912_83394.html">for 1990 p</a> .  and Optima <a href="http://moscow.shop.megafon.ru/mobile_g__g_1_tree_7912_83392.html">for 2490 r</a> .  So there will be enough gifts for everyone - and everyone will have enough for gifts. <br><br>  <b>Holiday greetings!</b> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/206634/">https://habr.com/ru/post/206634/</a></p>
