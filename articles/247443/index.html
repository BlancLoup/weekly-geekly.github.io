As promised, we publish the continuation of the article.  Of course, not all the techniques described by our Western colleagues can be applied right away in our conditions, but we can take something as a basis. <a name="habracut"></a><br>  <b>7. <a href="http://www.wired.co.uk/magazine/archive/2014/02/features/buzzfeed">How BuzzFeed used Social Sharing's plugin to become the media giant of a new era</a> .</b>  <b>The author is David Rowan.</b> <br><br>  BuzzFeed articles have a strange ability to make you want to click on the "share" button.  And even though they openly laugh at marketers, it is worth giving their due to frivolous and intricate content (no matter how stupid it is).

      In this post by David Rowan, BuzzFeed CEO John Peretti talks about what makes their ‚Äúairy‚Äù content so damn attractive for a repost. <br><br>  This post, more strategic than tactical, breaks the philosophy of the company, whose bread and butter is content.  As a bonus, Rovan even shares the internal ‚ÄúBuzzFeed Reference Guide by Number of Costs‚Äù. <br><br>  <b>8. <a href="http://coschedule.com/blog/repurpose-your-content/">50+ possibilities to change the purpose of your content</a> : a guide from Garrett Moon to CoSchedule.</b> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/707/b96/4c6/707b964c673347b39da0675e609462c5.png" alt="image"><br><br>  Smart marketers put their soul into every part of the content they create, trying to make it as useful and attractive as possible, and also make you think. <br>  But even the most amazing parts of the content may not be entirely relevant and not in demand after they are published. <br><br>  This post by Garrett Moon from CoSchedule offers you exactly what you promised: a detailed guide on more than fifty channels.  It can help you get the most out of everything you create.  Mun did a great job, could be brief, but touched on the advantages of each channel / platform. <br><br>  It doesn't matter how: through social networks or some other channels that you would never think about, this post will help you show the world what great content you have created. <br><br>  <u><b>Articles that breathe life into your content strategy</b></u> <br><br>  <b>9. <a href="http://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2014/05/19/contrarian-content-marketing">Marketing strategy that goes against the market: How to turn left when everyone goes to the right.</a></b>  <b>The author is Eliza Gabbert for WordStream.</b> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/66b/73c/432/66b73c432f764f4ea3a6b78eee855236.png" alt="image"><br><br>  In a world where everyone wants to create content that has practical value, posts may resemble each other‚Äôs clones - giving out the same clich√©s.  As Eliza eloquently expressed in this article for WordStream: <br><blockquote>  90% of content marketing is rubbish. </blockquote><br><br>  As a worthy alternative, she proposes to go against the general trends and create content that can make a fuss.  To illustrate her thesis, Eliza offers some delightful examples of successful alternative content. <br><br>  Since we are not talking about empty advertising bait, Hubbert explains: an alternative opinion can provoke interesting and stimulating discussions that benefit everyone - even those who are against. <br>  She also talks about why alternative content is usually well perceived, and how you can make sure that there is a grain of clever contradiction in every post you write. <br><br>  <b>10. <a href="http://moz.com/blog/content-marketers-and-journalists">What content marketers and journalists should learn from each other.</a></b>  <b>Author - Dan Levy for Moz (Mozilla).</b> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/379/84e/067/37984e0672ac441b8748ee7d2ac1e325.png" alt="image"><br><br>  As a journalist and content strategist, Dan Levy gained a unique advantage because he had the opportunity to see how content is created in both advertising and editorial. <br><br>  And, despite the fact that many journalistic methods have already entered service in the field of marketing (for example, editorial calendars and style guides), Levy explains that content marketers still have a lot to learn from journalists (and vice versa). <br><br>  In this thoughtful two-part post, Levy explains that any profession can borrow something valuable from the other.  He warns of the danger of dragging data without indicating their sources and refusing to refresh the basics of HTML. <br>  If you are a marketer who seeks to continuously improve your content, then this post will be very useful. <br><br>  <b>11. <a href="http://www.gregoryciotti.com/new-content-hires/">How to hire staff to create new content</a> .</b>  <b>The author is Gregory Siotti.</b> <br><br>  Now that you have an updated content marketing strategy that you can join in 2015, you probably understand that you also need additional resources. <br><br>  Gregory Siotti from HelpScout has written a great post to help you realize what you have planned.  The title says it all: "How to hire staff to create new content." <br><br>  He begins his post by emphasizing the importance of hiring the right person for this job: <br><blockquote>  ‚ÄúThe team you assemble is the foundation of your company.  Recruitment is the most important step in creating content. ‚Äù </blockquote><br>  Siotti reveals his method of finding personnel to create new content, as well as all aspects related to this process. <br><br>  If you find the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãhiring a new person to create content successful, then this post will also be very interesting to you. <br><br>  <u><b>Deciding to create smarter and more effective content marketing in 2015</b></u> <br><br>  You are probably working hard to show your audience worthwhile content.  But marketers always have something to do better and smarter. <br>  So let's take a New Year's decision ... <br><br>  ... Implement your New Year's decision - make a commitment to create more thoughtful content marketing in 2015. <br><br>  We hope that these articles will inspire you to try something outside your comfort zone.  Thus, you can get a lot for the year under the sign of content marketing. <br><br>  Now it's your turn - which article about content marketing for 2014 did you like the most? </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/247443/">https://habr.com/ru/post/247443/</a></p>
