He died at the age of 52 due to a heart attack.  Nosik is rightly considered a key figure, because he was one of those who formed the Russian-speaking segment of the Internet.  For many years, Anton Nosik had a great influence on the evolution of Runet.  He created dozens of projects, many of which still exist.  Even more projects Nosik participated. <br><br>  It is interesting that education at Anton Nosik is medical, the profile is dentistry.  In addition to medicine, he was interested in economics, and then in technology.  This interest, in the end, influenced the formation of Nosik as an Internet actor. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  He wrote about medicine and economics as a freelance correspondent for the newspaper Vesti.  A little later, he opened the ‚ÄúOur Networks‚Äù section, and then began working on the Evening Internet Newsletter.  The newsletter published news about the Global Network.  This work he conducted while in Israel.

      The most active period of activity of Anton Nosik began in 1997, when he returned to Russia.  Then the Russian-speaking segment of the network practically did not exist, since there were very few websites in Russian.  Emelyan Zakharov and Demian Kudryavtsev were engaged in the development of Runet, which attracted several people to create websites.  These were Artemy Lebedev, Anton Nosik, Alexander Gagin and other people.  Initially, the work <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%259D%25D0%25BE%25D1%2581%25D0%25B8%25D0%25BA,_%25D0%2590%25D0%25BD%25D1%2582%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BD_%25D0%2591%25D0%25BE%25D1%2580%25D0%25B8%25D1%2581%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B2%25D0%25B8%25D1%2587">was carried out</a> only on projects that were related to the activities of the Internet provider "Cityline" and the content provider "Netskate", then other projects appeared. <br><br>  Being engaged in the development of Runet, Nosik quickly became an expert in networking and media technologies.  Entrepreneurs who wanted to invest their money in a new field for themselves - information technology - began to turn to him for help.  Consultations concerned not only Internet technologies, but also contacts, contacts that could help on one issue or another.  ‚ÄúNosik was in the center of a giant web of social connections, and even those people whom he publicly hated continued to sit on this web and wait until he finally gets to them.  And he got to everyone, and not one of those whom he got did not regret, ‚Äù <a href="https://lenta.ru/columns/2017/07/09/nosik_anton/">said</a> Maxim Kononenko about him. <br><br>  A year after his return to Russia Nosik founded Gazeta.ru, two years later - Lenta.ru.  He remained editor-in-chief of the last resource until 2004.  Nosik also participated in the creation of NEWSru and a number of other media projects.  It all started after Nosik met Gleb Pavlovsky, President of the Effective Policy Foundation.  He supported the creation of several new resources, including the sites of Sergey Kiriyenko and Boris Nemtsov, as well as Forum.ru and Polit.ru.  Pavlovsky supported the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãcreating the first Internet newspaper in Runet, which could become an alternative to print publications of a similar subject.  The initial budget <a href="https://lenta.ru/articles/2017/07/09/nosikdead/">was</a> several hundred thousand dollars.  This is how Gazeta.ru appeared.  A little later, Nosik launched three more online publications, including Netoscope, Vesti.ru and Lentu.ru. <br><br>  A few years later, Nosik was offered to become vice president and then president of the Rambler.  The company then had a certain kind of difficulties due to the fact that neither the owners could attract enough of them, nor could they sell it.  Becoming at the helm, Nosik proposed to abandon the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãselling "Rambler", and try to get out at least for self-sufficiency.  Some of his ideas were used, some were not.  One of the ideas was to merge the Rambler with Yandex, which would solve a number of problems, including financial ones. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/5f9/8c9/8e9/5f98c98e917666f7811f0c035a2822f0.jpg" width="1280"><br><br>  In 2004, he left the post of editor-in-chief of Lenta.ru and began work on new and existing projects.  One of them was the MosNews website, which was positioned as an information resource about Russia for foreigners. <br><br>  A year later, in 2005, he and the other co-founders founded the Pomogie.org Foundation.  The organization was created so that the money collected for good purposes is really sent to people who need them.  Nosik said that there are many funds that use the collected funds not for the intended purpose, but to enrich their creators.  At the same time, the fund was positioned as an organization for Internet users.  ‚ÄúWe collected money only on the Internet, as now, in general, we are a foundation for Internet users.  For people who are non-public, who do not go anywhere, but who are watching what is happening on the network, ‚ÄùSarah Nezhelskaya <a href="http://philanthropy.ru/intervyu/2017/04/05/48148/">told about the principles of the foundation‚Äôs work</a> . <br><br>  In 2006, Nosik became one of the leaders of the company SUP.  Just two years later, he left the company, becoming the head of bfm.ru.  This happened in 2008, and in 2011 Nosik left bfm.ru, again, to work on new projects.  In 2014, he and his colleagues founded Mokhnaty Cheese LLC, a company whose profile of work is marketing research and public opinion.  He also was engaged in social and political work. <br><br>  Anton Nosik died at about two in the morning on July 9th.  According to his wife, his heart suddenly stopped when he rested at a dacha with friends. <br><br>  UPD.  Information was <a href="https://www.facebook.com/bulygina/posts/1485447311494624">published</a> on Facebook today regarding the place of farewell to Anton Nosik.  This can be done tomorrow, July 11 at 11:00 in the Central House of Writers at Bolshaya Nikitskaya 53. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/373619/">https://habr.com/ru/post/373619/</a></p>
