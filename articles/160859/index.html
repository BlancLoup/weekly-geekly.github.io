In its quest to provide a better life for people in need, a year earlier, Samsung went to Brazil.  Of course, there was found where to turn around with the implementation of charitable initiatives: Samsung began to support indigenous peoples of Amazonia living in the reservation zone without interfering with natural processes and destroying the local ecosystem.

This center was established in November last year and opened in June of this year.  In order to provide more favorable conditions for children living in the Amazon, Samsung has built this community center consisting of schools, dormitories, a medical center and a scholarship committee right in the midst of pristine forests.  In addition, central districts were provided with centralized power supply.  Local schoolchildren can use the technology center and library to get a qualified education and expand their general outlook. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/0af/982/7ff/0af9827ffe2633e8805b5ec7ce44ad83.jpg"><br><br>  This schoolgirl's name is Mikaeli, in the future she dreams of becoming a biologist.  Together with her family, she lives in a small village, daily fishing, hunting, and thus ensuring her existence.  This village is isolated from the outside world.  Mikaeli believes that a community center with computerized schools and Internet access will help her finally achieve her dream. <br><br>  The Negro River School School in the Amazon, built by Samsung, provides a modern education system for more than 1,800 people in this indigenous community.  The school provides children with primary, secondary and even special IT education.  Students can use the Internet and even watch movies in a mini-cinema during their free time.  In addition, Samsung has taken care of those students and teachers who find it difficult to get to the community center by building several hostels. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/337/6e7/a6d/3376e7a6dd02c96ce6c194e300aee662.jpg"><br><br>  Samsung Electronics supports the preservation of Amazonian ecosystems and the protection of the indigenous population.  The company also signed a joint partnership declaration with the FAS (Amazon Sustainable Development Fund) to reduce deforestation and help conserve forests in the Amazonia countries. <br><br>  In general and in general, this charitable initiative provides great opportunities for children to receive high-quality modern education and supports the protection of forests and life of the indigenous inhabitants of Amazonia.  Not so long ago, most people in this community made a living doing slash-and-burn farming, which led to the burning of large areas of forest.  By providing an adequate level of education for the indigenous people of Amazonia, Samsung hopes to reduce burning forest: after all, the new generation will be able to master many new professions. <br><br>  <b>Video:</b> <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/dQVuJ4Qsoeo%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700019,15700186,15700191,15700253,15700255,15700259&amp;usg=ALkJrhgGrCZMch9W-HA8FiFZL4RX7_a4cQ" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  Another Samsung social initiative this year took place in Vietnam. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/e04/014/0b9/e040140b9e480ea824aca276ea07a8c1.jpg"><br><br>  In the province of Bac Ninh, near Hanoi, most residents do not have the opportunity to spend as much time as they would like to learn, because family farms are the most important aspect of their survival.  As a result, the level of education in this region is significantly lower than in other areas of Vietnam. <br><br>  In April of this year, Samsung, along with the Global Working Group (a NGO based in Seoul), opened two libraries in Dang Leet and Tem De secondary schools to help students discover their potential and fully quench their thirst for knowledge.  More than 3,000 books, as well as chairs, tables, computers, and software for keeping books, were donated to educational institutions.  The list of the necessary literature was made by teachers and pupils of the Vietnamese schools. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/5d6/15c/943/5d615c943b6e1d62c9a4acc8e44b525a.jpg"><br><br>  The initiative was made possible thanks to donations from Samsung Electronics employees around the world.  Like the charity events that McDonald's holds, a fundraising campaign was organized at Samsung: each employee could buy elastic wristbands at a different cost (depending on the size of the desired donation) and, thereby, make a small contribution to the common cause.  Also, employees of the Vietnamese division of Samsung, along with Korean volunteers, took an active part in the overhaul of buildings intended for the placement of libraries.  From December 2011, when the project to create new libraries in poorly developed areas of Vietnam was launched, it is planned to spend more than 100 million Korean won (about $ 85,400) and build seven more libraries across the country until the end of 2013. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/db0/f4c/4f9/db0f4c4f912e0c090178ee8686c5d6a5.jpg"><br><br>  All this led to real changes in the life of schoolchildren.  In less than a year, the rating of two schools increased to the second highest rank among local schools.  One of the grateful students who have realized the benefits of the new project and are actively using libraries has become a schoolgirl Nguyen Thi Hong Tam. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/23d/64d/5ef/23d64d5ef24ab49a5ef78211467264c6.jpg"><br><br>  There is an ordinary Vietnamese schoolgirl there: she loves to study and tries to prepare impeccably for each exam.  Her usual day starts at 6 in the morning.  After breakfast with her family, she rides her bike to school.  Around noon, classes end and she returns home to help her mother with household chores.  This is the life beyond which she never went.  Everything has changed since the new library started working: it has become a favorite place where it spends most of its free time.  The books she read opened the door to a big new world for her and made her think seriously about a possible future outside of her little village. <br><br>  <b>Video:</b> <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/8v9vr_7-kUk%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700019,15700186,15700191,15700253,15700255,15700259&amp;usg=ALkJrhhCaMwfGYIqlO2GEnSvm3GqLPgj3g" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  By implementing similar global projects within the ‚ÄúHope to Children‚Äù social program, Samsung gives a chance for a better life for many children, including Michael and Tam. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/160859/">https://habr.com/ru/post/160859/</a></p>
