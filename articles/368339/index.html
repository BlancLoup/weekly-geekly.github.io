  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Private space: our days</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  More recently, space was available and interesting only to the governments of leading countries, since space launches were very expensive, and success was used mainly in the political arena.  In modern society, there has been a satiety of cosmic achievements: flights to the ISS have become commonplace, telephone communications and even television are transmitted via the Internet, images of the earth's surface are freely available.  He flew his shuttle space shuttle.  Perhaps the only space service that interests the planet‚Äôs population is global positioning.  There is a question: <a href="http://expert.ru/russian_reporter/2013/43/cheloveku-nechego-delat-v-kosmose/">what is a man to do in space</a> ? <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  As it turned out, rocket science enthusiasts were not translated yet.  Blame everything as usual money.  There were those who wanted to spend their considerable savings on the childhood dream of flying into space. <br><br>  In an incredibly short time, private projects offered their options for almost all types of space services.  The sphere of entertainment seems to be the most tasty morsel: from riding tourists into the stratosphere, to <a href="http://www.mars-one.com/">settling on Mars</a> (the main coverage of costs is assumed by selling a live broadcast of the event).  Also at gunpoint services for remote sensing of the Earth and various types of communication.  The ongoing miniaturization of electronics already allows you to create a spacecraft literally on the table.  And since the cost of launching into space is proportional to weight, the desire to have your own satellite has ceased to seem unrealizable. <br><br>  And of course the living legend of modern cosmonautics, the general director of SpaceIx (SpaceX) Ilon Mask (Elon Musk), said that he had founded the company with the main goal to help humanity become <a href="https://www.spacex.com/news/2013/03/31/reusability-key-making-human-life-multi-planetary">multi-planetary</a> .  True, there is another topic:

    <blockquote>  Humanity is the ‚Äú <a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk">biological loader</a> ‚Äù for digital life forms. </blockquote><br>  What do we (humanity) expect to see in the near future. <br><br><h5>  Domestic private space </h5><br>  Represented by the companies <a href="http://www.sputnix.ru/ru/">Sputnix</a> (Satellite Innovation Space Systems LLC) and <a href="http://dauriaspace.com/News">Dauria Aerospace</a> .  Both companies produce microsatellites for Roscosmos and other interested parties.  Sputnix proposes to output small satellites into orbit using universal transport-trigger mechanisms, integrating them into domestic rocket carriers, and provides ground infrastructure for controlling and receiving data from them.  In the Dauria order book, there are two geostationary telecommunications satellites for India and two Earth remote sensing devices for Roscosmos, which will be commissioned in 2015. On July 8, 2014, the company launched the third unit using the Soyuz-2.1b launch vehicle: experimental platform DX-1.  Earlier in June, the Dnepr rocket successfully put two Perseus-M microsatellites into orbit.  These devices are based on the company's own micro-satellite platform and carry instruments for monitoring ships on board. <br><br>  At the stage of stratospheric testing, the satellite-star of the community <a href="http://www.your-sector-of-space.org/">‚ÄúYour sector of space‚Äù</a> : <br><blockquote>  Astronautics is like-minded companies and interesting work, not a team of loafers and the lack of interesting projects;  it is science and creativity, not a blind copying of the heritage of fathers and grandfathers, this is our shining tomorrow, and not fading away yesterday. </blockquote><br>  Most recently, the company <a href="http://www.spacelin.ru/">"Lin Industrial"</a> lit up by attracting funds from virtual tank builders.  It is difficult to say whether they will succeed in flying something in the gland, their plans are too ambitious. <br><br><h5>  Non-domestic space </h5><br>  <a href="http://www.xcor.com/lynx/">Xcor Aerospace's</a> Lynx is a two-seater suborbital spacecraft capable of taking off and landing on a conventional runway.  In addition to the entertainment of commercial passengers, it is planned to conduct scientific experiments.  XCOR has already signed a contract with the South-West Research Institute for the flights of its scientists and experiments in the suborbital space.  The company plans to sell tickets for $ 95,000. <br><br>  <a href="http://www.virgingalactic.com/">Virgin Galactic's</a> six-seater SpaceShipTwo, like Lynx, is designed to send tourists and explorers on a suborbital space flight.  And, like XCOR, Virgin also contracted with the Southwest Research Institute.  SpaceShipTwo will rise to a height of about 15 kilometers on a WhiteKnightTwo carrier plane.  Then, using its own rocket engine, SpaceShipTwo will reach a height of 100 kilometers above the Earth‚Äôs surface.  Landing is made in an airplane.  Virgin Galactic has already sold over 500 tickets for $ 200,000 for space aboard SpaceShipTwo.  On October 31, 2014, <a href="http://www.space.com/27629-virgin-galactic-spaceshiptwo-crash-full-coverage.html">SpaceShipTwo crashed during a test flight</a> , one pilot was killed.  Despite some customer churn, Virgin Galactic <a href="http://www.space.com/27624-virgin-galactic-spaceshiptwo-crash-space-tourism.html">does not intend to close the project</a> . <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/f84/9e8/575/f849e8575f14a89e478e1a2cd35aea23.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Exos Aerospace, created in May 2014 from Armadillo Aerospace, is developing a <a href="http://armadilloaerospace.com/n.x/Armadillo/Home">spacecraft</a> for suborbital flights of vertical launch.  The device will accommodate two passengers.  Space tour operator Space Adventures reserves space on the ship for $ 110,000. A man from Arizona recently won a free flight in a competition organized by Space Adventures and Seattle's Space Needle, although the date of his flight has not yet been established. <br><br>  <a href="http://www.bigelowaerospace.com/">Bigelow Aerospace</a> designs and builds large, expandable modules that should be the main link in private space stations being created in orbit.  The company has already conducted in 2006 and in 2007 two tests of prototypes in orbit.  The six-seat BA 330 module provides about 330 cubic meters of usable volume.  Bigelow provides for connecting at least two 330s together.  The company has signed contracts with Boeing and SpaceX for the delivery of passengers to huge space hotels.  Potential customers include space agencies, government departments, and research teams. <br><br>  Microsoft co-founder Paul Allen recently teamed up with aerospace pioneer engineer Bert Rutan to create an enterprise called <a href="http://stratolaunchsystems.com/">Stratolaunch Systems</a> .  The company plans to launch rockets into space from a carrier aircraft, which will become the largest aircraft in history, with a wingspan of 117 meters.  Initially, the Stratolaunch will send cargo and satellites into space, but in the future hopes to launch astronauts as well.  The first test flight is scheduled for 2015, commercial launches are possible from 2016. <br><br>  <a href="http://www.aerospace-technology.com/projects/liberty-launch-vehicle/">Liberty Launch Vehicle</a> , which produced solid rocket boosters for the space shuttle, teamed up with Lockheed Martin and European Astrium, and is developing its own system for launching astronauts into low near-earth orbit.  The upgraded 91-meter Liberty rocket will deliver a seven-passenger capsule to orbit.  Test flights of the system will begin in 2014, the launch of the first astronaut is expected at the end of 2015.  If successful, commercial flights are possible from 2016. <br><br>  <a href="http://www.blueorigin.com/about/">Blue Origin</a> , created by Amazon.com founder Jeff Bezos, hopes to win a NASA contract to deliver astronauts to the International Space Station.  The created spacecraft is designed to carry seven passengers or a combination of cargo and crew.  The company is developing a reusable first stage of the launch vehicle in order to reduce the launch price as much as possible.  Representatives of the company claim that commercial flights of the spacecraft will begin by 2018.  Blue Origin is also developing a suborbital spacecraft called the New Shepard, which will be equipped with a reusable propulsion module. <br><br>  Dream Chaser of the Sierra Nevada company ( <a href="http://www.sncspace.com/ss_space_exploration.php">Sierra Nevada</a> ) is a small space plane designed to transport seven astronauts to low earth orbit.  The participant of the last round (Commercial Crew Transportation Capability) competition organized by NASA, on the right to <a href="http://news.yahoo.com/private-space-taxis-astronauts-move-closer-first-test-101653809.html">deliver American astronauts</a> to the ISS.  The device will be displayed in space using the Atlas-5 launch vehicle, and will land on its own as an aircraft.  Representatives of the company say that the space plane should be ready by 2016.  The first manned flight will take place in 2017. <br><br>  The second competitor - the aerospace giant Boeing (Boeing) - is developing a reusable (up to 10 flights) spacecraft for delivering cargoes and up to seven astronauts to the ISS called <a href="http://www.boeing.com/assets/pdf/defense-space/space/ccts/docs/CCDev2%2520Boeing%2520CST-100%2520Overview.pdf">CST-100</a> .  The device uses proven technologies from Apollo and NASA space shuttle.  It is expected that the CST-100 will perform the role of a lifeboat on the ISS in emergency situations.  Commissioning of the CST-100 is planned for 2016. <br><br>  Cygnus - automatic cargo space ship supply.  Developed by Orbital Sciences Corporation as part of <a href="http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/station/structure/launch/orbital.html">the Commercial Orbital Transportation program</a> .  Designed to deliver cargo to the International Space Station after the completion of the Space Shuttle program.  The launch is carried out using the Orbital proprietary launch vehicle Antares (Antares), formerly called Taurus II.  NASA has entered into a contract with Orbital Science for a total of $ 1.9 billion for 8 Signus missions to the ISS until 2016. <br><br>  California-based SpaceX is developing a reusable spacecraft, the <a href="https://www.spacex.com/dragon">Dragon V2,</a> to transport cargo and crew to low-Earth orbit and beyond.  The third competitor is NASA.  The manned version will carry up to seven astronauts to the ISS or to deep space, for example, to Mars.  The company has already launched several unmanned Dragons to the ISS.  The flights were a demonstration of SpaceX readiness using their own Falcon 9 launch vehicle to fulfill a contract with NASA for 12 cargo deliveries to the station.  Falcon 9 will also be re-usable in the future with a vertical fit on the retractable supports. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/361/e99/da0/361e99da04d8caa42a3786286923d4ab.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  <a href="http://www.mars-one.com/">Mars One</a> is a private organization whose mission is to establish a colony on Mars.  The project itself is not an aerospace company and does not produce equipment.  All equipment will be developed mainly by SpaceX.  The uniqueness of the project is in principle the impossibility of the return of colonists to Earth and financing through TV broadcasts in real time.  The colony is expected to be replenished every two years by six people starting in 2025. Rumors say that the founder of Mars One, the Dutch entrepreneur Bas Lansdorp, adds to the success of the event, is going to move to Mars himself. <br><br>  The falling banner of the discoverers of space was picked up in time.  Started a new space race!  A little competition never hurts.  The demand for flights into space, albeit for entertainment, apparently still remains. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/368339/">https://habr.com/ru/post/368339/</a></p>
