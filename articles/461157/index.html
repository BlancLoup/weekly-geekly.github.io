We will discuss what is happening and how the community reacts to it. <br><br> <a href="https://habr.com/ru/company/itglobalcom/blog/461157/"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/q6/y4/ue/q6y4ueykk_9iccpsb9azyujkezw.jpeg"></a> <a name="habracut"></a><br>  <font color="#A9A9A9"><i>Photos - <a href="https://unsplash.com/photos/AEB9kqWqOFM">Maurits Bausenhart</a> - Unsplash</i></font> <br><br><h2>  Bug Reporter is a thing of the past </h2><br>  During its June conference, Apple announced that they would stop supporting Bug Reporter.  This is a tool for sending error messages in applications.  Now developers will have to send all bug reports through Feedback Assistant, and bugreporter.apple.com already redirects visitors to <a href="https://feedbackassistant.apple.com/welcome">feedbackassistant.apple.com</a> .

      The application is available on the web and on iOS 12.4 beta, iOS 13 beta and macOS Catalina beta systems.  On a Mac, the Feedback Assistant is located in the <i>/ System / Library / CoreServices / Applications</i> directory.  You can also use the <i>applefeedback: //</i> URL scheme. <br><br><h2>  New functionality </h2><br>  According to Apple, with Feedback Assistant, developers will be able to send bug reports faster.  The following service features will contribute to this: <br><br><ul><li>  <b>Automatic collection of diagnostics</b> .  Now you do not need to attach a sysdiagnose file to each error report.  The Feedback Assistant does this automatically if an error report is sent from the corresponding application.  At the same time (only with the permission of the developer), the tool will conduct local diagnostics of the problem area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe OS in order to collect additional information.  Although what kind of sites are in question, Apple did not explain. </li><li>  <b>Cross-platform reports</b> .  You can send a report about an error that occurred on a third-party device.  For example, with Feedback Assistant on iOS, you can report a bug on Apple TV, HomePod, or Apple Watch.  The system will download all the necessary diagnostic information. </li><li>  <b>There are <a href="https://developer.apple.com/bug-reporting/status/">new statuses</a></b> .  They better reflect the status of the completed bug reports.  An example would be ‚ÄúPotential Fix Identified‚Äù - it means that the error will be fixed in a subsequent update of the operating system.  The status ‚ÄúInvestigation Complete - Works as Designed‚Äù means that the bug is actually a feature. </li></ul><br><h2>  What about the old bug reports </h2><br>  Reports from Bug Reporter will be available in the Feedback Assistant.  IDs of previous calls, files attached to them and technical support correspondence migrated to Apple. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/q0/w1/iv/q0w1iv4asb8izixdepu6tvargce.jpeg"><br>  <font color="#A9A9A9"><i>Photos - <a href="https://unsplash.com/photos/ssMYmNDdPtI">The Nigmatic</a> - Unsplash</i></font> <br><br>  But a number of bug reports were nevertheless removed - this was done to comply with the requirements of the GDPR.  According to his <a href="https://gdpr-info.eu/art-5-gdpr/">fifth article</a> , a company cannot store personal data for longer than what the processing purpose requires.  Therefore, Apple got rid of reports whose discussions were closed more than five years ago.  Also, ‚Äúbug reports‚Äù went that were not updated for at least 60 days. <br><br><h2>  What the community thinks </h2><br>  In general, the community has welcomed new changes positively.  Developers say the native application really makes sending bug reports easier.  Plus, there are more subcategories for classifying bugs.  Experts expect the new APIs and other Apple solutions to upgrade faster.  But the transition from one instrument to another did not go as smoothly as desired.  One of the developers <a href="https://mjtsai.com/blog/2019/06/12/feedback-assistant-replaces-bug-reporter/">in his blog noted</a> that all his old reports had a single date - this made the search more difficult.  And someone‚Äôs report identifiers <a href="https://twitter.com/steipete/status/1136708236051005440">have changed</a> . <br><br>  At the same time, the Feedback Assistant is still unstable.  Some users <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/iOSBeta/comments/bztl4x/bug_attaching_an_image_to_the_feedback_assistant/">cannot</a> send a bug report.  When you try to download a screenshot, the application crashes.  Although this problem can be circumvented - <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/iOSBeta/comments/bztl4x/bug_attaching_an_image_to_the_feedback_assistant/eqwwnhg/">you need to</a> download the report without a photo, and then edit it.  It is hoped that Apple engineers will eliminate all the shortcomings in the near future. <br><br><h2>  About other changes </h2><br>  In early June, Apple also <a href="https://developer.apple.com/news/%3Fid%3D06032019j">announced</a> changes to the guidelines for application developers.  The largest of them can be called a ban on the use of "third-party analytical services or advertising" in applications for children.  Its purpose is to comply with the requirements of American and European lawmakers, namely the <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/Children%25E2%2580%2599s_Online_Privacy_Protection_Act">Internet Privacy Protection Act</a> and GDPR. <br><br>  Some companies have already expressed their negative opinions regarding the new requirements.  For example, representatives of the PBS channel <a href="https://www.vox.com/recode/2019/6/11/186569">noted</a> that now it will be difficult for them to evaluate the performance of applications and, as a result, improve their functionality. <br><br>  It is also worth highlighting a new ban on VPN services.  Now companies developing anonymization tools on the network are forbidden to process, sell and transfer personal data of users to third parties.  This decision is likely due to a <a href="https://www.top10vpn.com/free-vpn-app-investigation/">recent Top10VPN study</a> .  According to the organization, half of the 30 most popular VPN applications are owned by Chinese companies.  This fact has <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/e5567d8a-ee65-11e8-89c8-d36339d835c0">raised concerns</a> in the American community. <br><br>  Moreover, Apple intends to exclude from the App Store all applications that collect any user data from third-party sources without permission.  We will be able to see the first results of the new company policy in the near future.  Developers must bring all applications in the store in accordance with the new requirements by September 3, 2019. <br><br><hr><br>  We at <a href="https://itglobal.com/">ITGLOBAL.COM</a> offer private and public cloud services.
