  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Preview Parallels Plesk 11: step into the "cloud"</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Hello.  At the recent Parallels Summit 2012, the 11th version of the Parallels Plesk Panel hosting control panel was presented.  I managed to look at the product preview with my own eyes, what I want to tell about in this post.  In short - a number of panel functions have been created or improved under the influence of users.  Even today's "chips", such as the new interface and the underlined friendliness to the "cloud" use of the product, were made not just "to be", but with an eye to the needs of professional users and on what exactly the hosts will earn in the near future. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/ae1/ed8/254/ae1ed8254a0461024aca7ddc45b40f77.jpg"><br><br>  Tonight Parallels has posted a preview of the 11th version.  For specialists inside the post there is a link to the Windows and Linux distributions of the new panel.  All who cares, I invite under the cat.

    <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  About Parallels Plesk Panel knows, probably, every reader of the blog "Hosting" on Habr√©.  Plesk often becomes an ‚Äúentry ticket‚Äù to the professional hosting market, as it initially offers three critical functions within one product - the control panel itself, billing, and the site builder.  Due to its ‚Äúboxiness‚Äù, Parallels Plesk is easy to deploy and configure, based on which you can immediately start offering a number of basic services ‚Äî dedicated servers, VPS and (if not as flexible as sometimes needed) shared hosting.  Who cares, you can read a great review of Parallels Plesk and its main competitor from the point of view of a hoster in three parts - <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/hosting/120821/">one</a> , <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/hosting/120923/">two</a> , <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/hosting/120961/">three</a> . <br><br>  But, as often happens, the shortcomings of ‚ÄúSplash‚Äù are extensions of its merits.  The main difficulty is that the services provided on the Parallels Plesk Panel are scaled only by increasing the number of servers (virtual or physical, not so important) and installing Pleska new licenses on these servers.  This development model is not suitable for everyone.  The main thing, as explained separately at the summit, is inconvenient for Parallels itself.  After all, the company earns on deductions from hosters.  It is in her interest to make the partner sell more from month to month.  Will sell more to customers - will order more from a vendor.  The amount depends on the amount of leasing payments from each partner. <br><br>  Approximately such considerations guided the developers, making the 11th version of "Splashes".  They did not turn the panel on with dozens of new features - ideologically, the new Parallels Plesk remained the starter kit for newbies, and a business tool for small providers and web studios, who prefer to manage client sites themselves.  The Pleska team collected feedback from partners, tried to rethink existing features and implement them in terms of ease of management. <br><br><h2>  Interface </h2><br><br>  From time to time ‚ÄúSplash‚Äù is blamed on the interface, and there is still no unity on this issue.  Some users prefer the ‚Äúold‚Äù version (version 9.x and later).  In version 11, the ideas developed in the top ten were further developed.  How much more convenient everything has become yet to be verified.  But the new interface looks very nice.  I would say the influence of Parallels Desktop for Mac is felt - the most famous and popular product of the company. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/bf7/f3f/e93/bf7f3fe93a2bebf5c00a6734ba1049be.jpg"><br><br>  Client part: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/213/158/e08/213158e08c6704f95a88c2a76b25d9a5.jpg"><br><br><h2>  "Cloud" features </h2><br><br>  To the question ‚ÄúWhy should the panels go to the‚Äú clouds ‚Äù?‚Äù I was answered with figures from the Parallels <a href="http://www.parallels.com/smbreport/">study</a> .  According to the company's forecasts, by 2014 the hosted infrastructure will occupy about 27% of the cloud market with a volume of $ 64 billion. That is, to grab its part of the cake, the hoster must work with the panel that can be married with the cloud infrastructure.  So that the cloud money did not pass by, the panel was endowed with the following abilities: <br><br><ul><li>  Cloning and quick launch of virtual machines and / or containers with Plesks installed in them.  Instances will not need to be re-created manually.  Licenses for Plesk are automatically registered to new instances - this service must be activated by the provider.  Both Parallels Server Bare Metal and virtual machines of the main vendors are supported. </li><li>  "Clearance" of prices under cloud / VPS.  The company ruble encourages partners to provide virtual private server services and cloud infrastructure.  When using any vendor hypervisors on the panel version of Plesk Unlimited Domains and Plesk 100 Domains, special conditions apply.  This is an obvious answer cPanel VPS Optimized, the services on which had a lower cost and, accordingly, gave the hoster more room for price maneuver. </li><li>  Power User interface mode by default.  Optimized for VPS / cloud-use.  Added option Simple View, which allows you to customize the interface, excluding from it those blocks that you do not use. </li></ul><br><br><h2>  Web servers </h2><br><br><ul><li>  Blew Apache support.  Apache modules can be added and excluded by ticking the appropriate checkbox.  This allows you to better manage the consumption of RAM on each server and thereby increase the density of VPS per node.  There is a "foolproof": critical Apache modules can not be stopped. </li><li>  Nginx  The most popular web server of the .ru domain zone is located a few clicks away and is automatically installed on Plesk 11.  Comrades <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/users/alecksey/" class="user_link">alecksey</a> and <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/users/freem4n/" class="user_link">freem4n</a> , you heard :) </li></ul><br><br><h2>  post office </h2><br><br><ul><li>  Improved Linux mail system based on Postfix.  Holds 100.000+ mailboxes (tested). </li><li>  The problems of a single mail handler (for example, antivirus) will not affect the overall availability of the mail. </li><li>  Mail goes through client IP (dedicated or shared), so spammers among clients are calculated at a time. </li></ul><br><br><h2>  Parallels Plesk for Windows </h2><br><br><ul><li>  PHP 5.3 support. </li><li>  Improved support for Microsoft Web Matrix. </li><li>  Ability to completely remove Parallels Plesk without dancing with a tambourine.  As many know, before uninstalling Plesk for Windows was a whole problem. </li></ul><br><br>  This post appeared some time after the official announcement of the new panel exactly because it was Parallels who <a href="http://www.parallels.com/download/plesk/11">posted</a> two versions of the Plesk 11 preview for that night - for Linux and for Windows.  In general, according to observations, in the course of communication with clients at the summit, the ‚ÄúSplash‚Äù team was greatly inspired: hosters see changes from version to version, praise much, express wishes - it is clear that they do not care.  Thanks to Habr's readers, perhaps the dream of ibKpoxa is <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/users/ibkpoxa/" class="user_link">realized</a> , and the ‚ÄúHappiness‚Äù button will appear in Plesk :) </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/139084/">https://habr.com/ru/post/139084/</a></p>
