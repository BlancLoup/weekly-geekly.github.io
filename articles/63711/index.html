  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Newly Labels</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  As I wrote in my FriendFeed, the guys at Google program their services faster than I write about them in my <a href="http://gappsbook.ru/">book</a> :) <br><br>  (Disclaimer: yes, I know that Habr also <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/google/63389/">managed to write</a> about this). <br><br>  The story is this.  Probably, many of the users of the Gmail postal service noticed that literally the other day, the familiar labels for ordering letters have changed quite a bit.  There are several innovations: firstly, by default, only a few of the most used tags are now displayed.  All others are hidden behind the “More ...” pop-up menu.  I am glad that the set of displayed and hidden labels can be changed: to do this, simply click on the link, then drag the desired labels from the pop-up window to the main screen. <a name="habracut"></a>  The shortcut bar itself disappeared and the list of tags came close to the standard mail section: Inbox, All Mail, etc.  In general, the line between these sections and tags has practically disappeared - even in the settings, where a separate tab “Labels” has now appeared, the system sections are called “System shortcuts”, and now they can also be hidden, saving space on the screen and not being distracted by the number of unread messages in Spam folder, for example.

      Gmail's drag'n'drop support is now everywhere and if you need to mark a message with a shortcut, simply drag it to the desired one.  The reverse works as well - when dragging a shortcut to the email area, flagged messages will be marked with it. <br><br>  The orientation of the Gmail mail service to ordinary users who are accustomed to the standard folders of the mail client is obvious - now the labels are almost indistinguishable from them.  It's great that at the same time they retained their distinctive feature - a letter can simultaneously have several labels.  Caring for new users is also manifested in the appearance of four pre-configured labels “Personal”, “Travel”, “Receipts”, “Work” (Personal, Travel, Receipts, Work) for newbies just starting their work with online mail - according to Google engineers , many of them simply did not know about the possibility of creating their own sections. <br><br>  Well, now I’ll definitely have to rewrite this section of the first chapter of the book, just dedicated to labels.  All this is history: <br>  <i>Instead of the usual folders in which you could put messages, Google engineers decided to use shortcuts.</i>  <i>The main difference of this approach is the ability to “attach” several tags to one message.</i>  <i>What is convenient?</i>  <i>Any message thus acquires as if several dimensions, now they can be selected and viewed according to different criteria.</i>  <i>Below you will see for yourself that the new approach is very convenient and effective ...</i> <i><br><br></i>  <i>... The item “Move to” allows you to take a message from the “Inbox” section and assign a specific label to it, while the message itself from the “Inbox” will disappear.</i>  <i>But ... we still have no labels!</i>  <i>Let's create one.</i>  <i>Reading a letter with new tasks from the boss?</i>  <i>Let's assign a Boss label to this post!</i>  <i>(Originals can practice their wits by giving the label their favorite management nicknames) See how simple it is: select the “Move to - Create” menu item.</i>  <i>In the window that appears, enter the name of the label.</i> <i><br><br></i>  <i>Click "OK".</i>  <i>See: the message disappeared from the "Inbox" section and is now available from the "All Mail" items and the "Boss" label.</i> <i><br><br></i>  <i>However, the full power of labels appears when we have several of them.</i>  <i>Let's create the set we need by going to “Settings - Shortcuts”: this section is responsible for creating, renaming and deleting tags.</i>  <i>Do not be afraid, deleting shortcuts, delete the messages themselves - unlike the standard folders, the labels just disappear from the messages without affecting them.</i>  <i>In addition to the “Boss” we create the labels “Family” and “Best”.</i>  <i>A letter from a brother in which he congratulates you on his birthday can be attributed simultaneously to two categories: “Family” and “Best”, right?</i>  <i>Let's assign several shortcuts to the letter: open the letter, press the “Labels” button and tick the ones that we want to attach to the message.</i>  <i>And the letter from the boss, where he informs you about the promotion, can also be attributed to the “Best” of the messages you received from the boss.</i>  <i>Do you understand the idea?</i>  <i>Then selecting the label “Best” you will receive a personal top of messages from both relatives and from management.</i> <i><br><br></i>  <i>How can labels be applied?</i>  <i>Well, firstly, to build a peculiar message hierarchy: you can create a “Mailing List” label that will be given to all those numerous anecdotes, weather forecasts and recipes of dishes that you receive by subscription, as well as get labels for each specific category: “Recipes” , "Anecdotes", "Weather".</i>  <i>Want-see mailing in bulk, if you want - choose a specific section.</i>  <i>Another example: some like to create a separate label for each addressee.</i>  <i>However, in addition, you can create another dimension label: “@Important!”, Which allows you to view all important messages “regardless of faces”.</i>  <i>The prefix in the form of "dog", "@" - a small trick, thanks to which the label will always be at the top of the list.</i> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/63711/">https://habr.com/ru/post/63711/</a></p>
