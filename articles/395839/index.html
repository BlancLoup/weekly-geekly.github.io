Some of the games that were popular on SNES, Sega, PlayStation, remain popular until now.  New versions of some hits are appearing on the latest gaming consoles.  For example, forever alive Mortal Combat.  Now they are going to revive Crash Bandicoot. <br><br>  Sometimes you want to play not in the novelties, but in the old games - those that we played many years ago.  This can be done - in the markets and in the network there are old used consoles, accessories, games.  But there is a more affordable option - emulators of game consoles.  Thanks to emulators, you can not waste old consoles, cartridges, discs with games.  Programs of this kind are many, they are available for various platforms.  Today we will look at the best, time-tested and many players versions of emulators of game consoles for Android OS. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  The game console emulator is a software shell that emulates the operation of the hardware of the device itself.  Developing an emulator is not so easy - it requires both programming experience and knowledge of accurate information about the principles of operation of the emulated device itself.  Most emulators can be divided into two groups, including ‚Äúsimple‚Äù and ‚Äúcomposite‚Äù programs.  Emulators provide even more functionality than old consoles (for example, saving in games for Dandy and Sega).

      With simple it is easy - you need to install the program, download the image of the game, and everything - you can enjoy the process of passing.  Settings in such programs at least.  "Compound" require additional components - these are BIOS prefixes (usually a .bin file) and various dll plugins.  For the vast majority of emulators of consoles for Android, plug-ins are not needed.  But the BIOS is needed.  These files are protected by the rights of the manufacturer, so that the developers of emulators can not embed them - otherwise such an emulator will not get into the Google software catalog.  You need to search for the BIOS on the network - there are many sites where these files are shared. <br><br>  Need and images of games.  Their emulator developers also do not have the right to build in their software.  Images, or ROM, are available on the Internet.  For Sega or PlayStation, the number of ROM reaches many hundreds.  Now on the Internet you can find images of even very rare games that were previously difficult to obtain in the store. <br><br><h3>  Oldest Systems </h3><br><h4>  ColecoVision </h4><br>  <b><a href="http://downloads.tomsguide.com/ColEm-Deluxe,0301-59313.html%3F_ga%3D1.139885043.159864117.1467361545">ColEm Deluxe</a></b> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/0b4/d25/930/0b4d25930f43112407ba2af45c75437d.jpg" width="780"><br><br>  This game console is not known to everyone.

Cheats, wireless controllers are supported. <br><br>  There is an interesting function of returning the character to the past.  If during the passage of the game you are "killed", then you can turn on rewind, and go back a certain time ago.  You can also avoid the fatal consequences of death by saving the game at important points in the gameplay in order to boot up in case of a problem, but this takes time.  And here - one click on the button, and the deceased hero returns. <br><br>  There is an emulation of light guns - you can use your finger instead of shots.

As an attempt to conquer the market during the sixth generation of gaming systems, the Dreamcast was designed to compete with the PlayStation and Nintendo 64. <br><br>  Reicast is the only emulator of this game console for Android.  It is not perfect, but it can run most games.  Its system requirements are not too high, the lower threshold is a dual-core Cortex-A9 with a frequency of 1 GHz. <br><br>  An emulator appeared in 2013, developers are actively working on the project now.  Thanks to this, the emulator supports the majority of games released for Sega Dreamcast.  When you run some games, graphic artifacts appear on the screen.  Judging by the reviews, the emulator is productive, there are no problems with ‚Äúbrakes‚Äù. <br><br><h3>  Sony play station </h3><br>  <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details%3Fid%3Dcom.epsxe.ePSXe">ePSXe</a> <br><br><iframe width="420" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/SklOL287FAY%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700002,15700023,15700186,15700191,15700248,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhiRJ8tMzf9M_FjVFQMQOmTkyt6d_g" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  ePSXe is one of the oldest PlayStation PC emulators.

High compatibility with games (99% of games supported), excellent performance.  It is possible to change the control buttons, setting the output video, audio.  External joystick and keyboard connected via Bluetooth or USB are supported, such as WiiMote, Sixaxis, Xbox 360, Moga, Ipega. <br><br>  There is compatibility with OpenGL plugins, which allows to improve the graphics and game performance.  Cheat codes are maintained.  ePSXe natively supports ARM and Intel Atom X86.

There is support for OpenGL plugins, which allows you to customize the output of video for different games. <br><br>  FPse is more complicated than ePSXe, there are more settings in this emulator.  If you just need to play, choose ePSXe.  If you want to set up your mobile device as efficiently as possible, I recommend FPse.  There is even multiplayer support for some games, including Tekken3. <br><br>  As in the previous case, there is support for Xbox 360, PS3, PS4 gamepads and other game controllers. <br><br>  Detailed information on how to work with this emulator can be found here <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist%3Flist%3DPLOYgJXtdk3G9PMkJYnm2ybONIi5-i_Iu5">via this link</a> .

Its price is $ 5.99.  This is higher than the cost of most emulators, but there are few analogues in the market.  There is also a free version, but an advertisement is shown to the user in it.  The project has appeared recently.  The application has been developed for several years, and now the emulator works fine on smartphones, tablets and even TV-sticks.  True, the device configuration must be modern, old phones or tablets will not be able to work with the emulator. <br><br>  The emulator sometimes does not work correctly.  Compatibility - not with all games.
