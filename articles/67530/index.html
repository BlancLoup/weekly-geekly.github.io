The topics of healthy eating, healthy sleep, and several related topics were also mentioned.  The last publication at the moment told about such discipline as bodybuilding.  For this thanks to the author of the <a title="Vaccine for IT" href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/arbeit/67498/">publication</a> <a href="https://megamozg.ru/users/sortafreel/" class="user_link">sortafreel</a> , in addition, the material may be useful to many of us.  But (and here they will start kicking me with plush slippers, as it usually happens), people don‚Äôt need sports at all, they need development, spiritual and physical development.  So why not sport, and what can I offer to an interested reader? <br><br><h2>  Why not sport? </h2>

      The word "sport" means competition: in speed, endurance, lifted weight, thrust, jump length.  And let many kick me well for these words, but there is no other sport.  Yes, of course, many people do something for their own pleasure.  Someone runs before bedtime, someone plays table tennis, perhaps badminton, and someone is inspired by the forms of his own body, which continue to improve with each workout.  But, in this case, a particular discipline does not bring the results that it could, but an adherent of a particular sport drives itself into a framework that does not allow it to develop.  Sport == restriction, because the development, if it occurs, is carried out only in one of many areas. <br><br>  Where a broader concept - "healthy lifestyle".  But no one can say exactly how this is?  Healthy nutrition, sports, walking, movement - all these words certainly characterize the concept, but do not define it.  Want specifics?  I offer you a real discipline that has its own history, modern discipline, powerful and comprehensive.  I'm talking about the natural method. <br><br><h2>  What is it? </h2><br><br>  The natural (natural) method is a comprehensive discipline created for the complex development of a person, the observance of which cultivates tremendous spiritual and physical qualities.  The system used to train the military was born by a French officer, developed and understood by modern practitioners.  Interesting? <br><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h2>  The appearance of methode naturelle. </h2><br><br>  The natural method came into being thanks to the work of <a title="Wikipedia about Georg Gebert in English" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georges_H%25C3%25A9bert">Georges H√©bert</a> , a French officer who gave birth to a new discipline, the main motto of which was the words: ‚ÄúTo be strong to be useful.‚Äù  The idea of ‚Äã‚Äãthe need to create a new discipline that combines sports skills of various directions with the education of a person of altruistic views and courage, even more strengthened in his heart when he managed in 1902 to conduct a dangerous rescue operation of the residents of the city of St.  Pierre (Martinique) from the devastating volcanic eruption. <br><br>  Hebert was surprised by the incredible physical skills of the indigenous people of Africa, observing which, he was convinced that the real development of a person is possible only in a natural environment and only by natural methods. <br><br>  This is how Georg Gebert expressed his impressions of the observation of the aborigines: <br><br><blockquote>  "Their bodies were splendid, flexible, nimble, skilful, but not creepy." </blockquote><br><br><blockquote>  ‚ÄúTheir bodies were gorgeous, flexible, dexterous, capable, strong, resilient, and yet they had no other mentor than nature, in accordance with which they lived.‚Äù </blockquote><br><br>  (We do not pay attention to the free translation, I wanted to convey the mood) <br><br>  The natural method was widely used to train the French military, and it is not surprising, since this discipline gives a person strength, courage, dexterity, makes him healthy and capable of quick, decisive and successful actions.  The natural development of the body, mind and spirit leads to the formation of man in his original, natural, quality, able to feel the world, understand it and interact with it. <br><br>  The concept of the natural method is closely connected with Hebertism (Hebert athleticism), as well as with the modern urban direction - parkour. <br><br><h2>  What does the practice of the natural method include? </h2><br><br>  Complex development: <br><br>  - Running, walking, crawling, walking, bent, walking on four legs <br>  - Jumping, supporting jumps, overcoming natural and artificial obstacles <br>  - Somersaults, self-insurance <br>  - Balancing <br>  - Swimming, diving <br>  - Natural climbing <br>  - Raising stones, logs, exercises with natural weights, throws, twisting <br>  - Hand-to-hand fight, fight <br>  - Survival <br>  - self-discipline <br><br><iframe width="420" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/QmMKgtoDGcU%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=25657,15700019,15700186,15700191,15700253,15700256,15700259&amp;usg=ALkJrhgsbfZ4yjClm6ymQm4DP_z5V8ZgIg" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/SKGF-ErsJiI%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=25657,15700019,15700186,15700191,15700253,15700256,15700259&amp;usg=ALkJrhgv_zcH53QHd5DGk7KZCwoLbAGXbw" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/hUMCv7f4NF0&amp;xid=25657,15700019,15700186,15700191,15700253,15700256,15700259&amp;usg=ALkJrhiganjH1wJ8p3_L9hGF9VTBbJUWqw" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  Currently, many tracers (people involved in parkour) are also practicing the natural method.  This allows you to extend your experience of moving in the most incredible conditions. <br><br><h2>  How to start, and what constitutes a natural method today. </h2><br><br>  First you need to find all possible materials (and there are not so many of them on the net) about the discipline, study them, understand whether you need it, and, if you decide to, start thinking and reading practical exercises.  It is important to take a meaningful approach to any action that you do.  A very good step forward will be the study of anatomical atlas and sports medicine (at least in general terms).  All this will help in further studies and add awareness.  It is very important to strive for development, never stopping, not giving in, trying to approach the practice with a positive attitude.  You need to start taking a contrast shower, temper.  Forcing yourself to live, breathe, be alone with the world, tear your ass from the chair more often. <br><br>  The real opportunity to quickly join the number of people practicing the natural method is to ask for help from the ‚Äúsenior‚Äù comrades.  And it‚Äôs better if these are real people and not balabols from parkour forums. <br><br>  For people from the west, Comrade <a title="Biography of the author of the discipline MovNat" href="http://movnat.com/about/erwan-le-corre">Erwan Le Corr</a> can be the inspiration, who has refined the knowledge of the natural method in his own MovNat system, clearly identifying new issues of perception of the discipline.  The site is recommended for thorough study. <br><br>  In Russia, I can only recall a few people who are seriously engaged in the natural method, and move it to the masses.  The most active and well-known figure in the parkour scene and a follower of the natural method is Mikhail Golikov.  Let it be a small advertisement, but the guys (Alexey Chigretsky, Artem Moskovtsev, Mikhail Golikov, Mikhail Serezhenkin, I apologize if you forgot someone) from parkourcreation (look in search engines, I don‚Äôt give a link so as not to accidentally arrange habraeffect) , both paid and with free entrance, they are also engaged in organizing trips and the natural method, which is also trained.  I recommend to everyone. <br><br>  But still.  It is better to practice discipline alone with yourself; companies for such trainings are not very suitable.  It is necessary to find a more or less clean forest, you can also in the city, a place where you can be sure that you will not collect glass or syringes with your feet if you run barefoot.  Exercise preferably in a minimum of clothes (just wear shorts), barefoot, but not supercooling.  Hardening helps to remain unattainable for frost in the fall and even in winter.  Everything should be approached gradually, intelligently, and development should occur smoothly and naturally.  You should not jump into the ice hole on the second day of training, learn to feel your body, to be in harmony with it. <br><br>  That's all I wanted to say. <br><br>  <strong>Update:</strong> I know that using VKontakte now equates to treason, and TVs are no longer in the homes of progressive citizens, but let me post here a link to <a href="http://vkontakte.ru/club8587449">the MN creation community</a> ( <strong>Beware, contact!</strong> ). <br><br>  <a href="https://megamozg.ru/users/mercury13/" class="user_link">Mercury13</a> suggested that reading Georges H√©bert is necessary as Georges Hebert.  It seems that this is the case if H√©bert is French.  To the best of my ignorance of French, I will trust the assumption of <a href="https://megamozg.ru/users/mercury13/" class="user_link">Mercury13</a> . <br><br>  Oh yes!  I wish everyone to be healthy and happy. <br></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/67530/">https://habr.com/ru/post/67530/</a></p>
