In addition, it is a kind of insider - the Pure Water GNU philosophy, attached to the Microsoft product.

      Like many others, I was faced with a lack of systematic and allowing to get an understanding of the subject of materials designed for people who previously had no relation to programming.  To put it another way, it became clear that - There is no such resource or library in Ukrnet with an online consultant of pros who would give an opportunity to take and understand the basics of programming.  You say a minute, but what about Microsoft Certification Centers.  There is also a powerful and systemic Cyber ‚Äã‚ÄãBionic Systematics.  There is a ‚ÄúSTEP‚Äù academy, forgive, Lord, who has become the talk of the town.  But still educational.  Yet‚Ä¶ <br>  Of course, all this is.  Fee, but okay - "God is with them."  Just to be available.  If only for the benefit of the people ... <br>  This is not exactly about this.  Here is an article about the start.  That situation when a person wants to learn and is looking for information.  Looking for.  Looking for.  Wants.  It wants to.  And, nevertheless, he finds it (It‚Äôs still talking about our students :) and, of course, making mistakes (It‚Äôs still talking about our students :). <br>  It is on their (error) base and the base of a sound sense of humor, we built this material. <br>  We hope you enjoy it. <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  When attending specialized programming courses, for example, Starting C #, you can simply listen to the trainer and complete the Tasks attached to the Video lessons on C #.  You can also watch C # video clips available on other .NET programming resources and offering a quick start based on using the tools of this Microsoft platform and offering CLR knowledge through understanding C # as a programming language available for learning zero.  Despite the stated duration of training courses in 32, 76 or 112 hours.  Believe me, you will have to accept the fact that you cannot learn how to program by spending just a week or two on it.  But, during this period of time, you can fully assimilate the basics of the model and organize the workflow, in essence, facilitating your work, creating conditions that maximally optimize the process of learning to program in C #, as well as identifying bottlenecks and how to solve them. <habracut><br><br>  It is on these ‚Äúdifficulties‚Äù that we will try to focus attention in this material, while at the same time trying to give solutions.  Most of the ‚ÄúC # learning problems‚Äù are connected with restlessness, inattention and, more importantly, unwillingness to practice solutions with abstract-spatial thinking, thus not allowing, in the learning process, to name problems and difficulties - problems and solve them.  We hope that this material will help you in overcoming the very "beginner steps" that any novice developer is facing who wants to learn C #. <br><br>  Let's get started <br><br>  1) Study C #.  First <b>tasks</b> <br><br>  We have not for nothing highlighted the word task.  Practicing such an approach as replacing negative attitudes with positive solutions, you will deal a crushing blow to two of the strongest enemies of the C # programmer - procrastination and haste.  The first-priority task of any programmer resembles the task of ‚Äúyamabus‚Äù, itinerant Buddhist monks.  First of all, if you want to learn how to write in C #, like in any other object-oriented language, you will have to gain Awareness.  You should clearly realize that you are being explained why you need this knowledge, what ideas do you have when getting this knowledge and, most importantly, you should clearly understand that your programming trainer does everything for what he does.  Programmers often tend to overestimate their experience.  The craving for simplification of the constructions created happens to give reverse results - a person becomes accustomed to the fact that his decision is always ‚Äúsimple‚Äù, which means that the efforts applied to the solution are low-cost in time.  This is how procrastination occurs - postponing decisions to the eternal tomorrow and ‚Äúreaction 2‚Äù, so called because unconscious novices in programming act according to two models: either ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know anything and therefore I will never understand it!‚Äù And ‚ÄúOh!  So I read it!  It's like from those video courses on C # - I know all this! ‚Äù.  Fear and hyperactivity are bad helpers.  And it is they.  Therefore, let us remember the conclusion: never take your time, always know why and why you study programming here and now, complete the curriculum, do the tasks only correctly and on time, and only then move on. <br><br>  2) Work with code examples in C #.  The issue of attention and priorities <br><br>  At the beginner level, using opportunities such as full-time C # tutorials, C # video tutorials and using literature, most novices in programming turn pluses into minuses.  Support organized by the trainer, access to video materials on C #, with the included problem books and access to examples on the Internet, make learners of basic C # think that programming is something like a ‚ÄúLEGO designer‚Äù, where the code simply indicates which modules lie and that collecting them solves problems.  But this is absolutely not true!  The job of the programmer is to write the code.  A programmer's life is Understanding the code.  All workouts are done in the name of Understanding the role of certain elements, syntax and concepts of C #, as well as the environment in which the programmer deploys C # solutions.  The beginning of learning programming is a waste of a huge amount of time for a trainer to ask questions and talk about examples of C # code in order to carefully and calmly understand how to work with what the code does. <br><br>  3) Work with the action.  Practical analysis of C # solutions <br><br>  Working with code examples, conscious and consistent study of C # logic, MS Visual Studio toolkit, correct determination of priorities, based both on the analysis of acquired knowledge in C #, and on the opinion of a trainer who knows much more, insure you from the ‚Äúmanager‚Äôs approach‚Äù who prefers copy-paste writing.  Code to write.  This action is peculiar to programmers.  And if you have already decided to learn how to program in C #, get used to Enter solutions.  Line by line, sorting out solutions with a coach, learning logic, understanding why it is written this way and not otherwise.  Such an approach will lead you to the fact that sooner or later you suddenly notice that you no longer only see, why you wrote this way and not otherwise, but you can write differently, more simply and more conveniently.  ‚ÄúFind and change‚Äù is the whole essence of modern programming, in C # or any other modern language.  When you write a program, you always look for data, then change it, introducing an increasing number of interconnections, which in turn change the data so that it turns out the very necessary data that was determined by the task. <br><br>  4) Use task books and a debugger to understand the features of C #.  Write your own code <br><br>  Understanding examples, knowledge of syntax, ability to understand system logic and process logic, familiarity with key definitions of the C # abstract-spatial model, concepts of C # class, C # and C # object functions, as well as the ability to create projects in MS Visual Studio, give you the right to try your strength  Remember, attentiveness and restraint are relevant here.  Developing your own variants of tasks from the textbook and practical tasks that complemented the video lessons on C #, writing your versions without reference to the source code bases - you need any practice that trains you not only as an implementer, but also as an ‚Äúidea generator‚Äù.  Do not forget about using the debugger, which forces the C # programmer to go through constructions created by him, line by line, again and again, until the code is optimized and operational.  Pride for the work done - this is the desired result in the training of IT specialists in Ukraine, especially if we are talking about training a programmer who has chosen the way of studying C #.  Pride, easily convertible into any chosen motivation.  After all, everybody really wants a truly good specialist! <br><br>  There remains only one rule for proper training of a C # developer, this comprehension of the essence of the following subsection of our article. <br><br>  5) Cotton one palm or rule of 10,000 questions.  The need for a comprehensive and systematic approach to learning C # programming and learning the .NET platform <br><br>  If you have learned how to write code, then this probably means that you are no longer new to C #.  Now you have gained autonomy and know both the principles of personal organization of the workflow, and the ‚Äúbottlenecks‚Äù and work methods that allow you to pass them with ease and grace of an experienced C # programmer.  What does this mean?  Have you become a C # developer?  Not.  You just took the first step.  You need a sobering clap with one hand, or speaking without parables and associative series with Buddhism, simply a slap issued to yourself with a smile.  Now you can move on to what is called C # In-Depth or answer to the trainer who has been keeping the noob in black all this time.  Your turn has come, that's what it means.  10,000. That's 10,000 questions!  No less!  10,000 questions will be heard from you by the trainer in the online consultation, in the process of full-time study of in-depth study of C #, watching video lessons and discussing them.  Conscious, unhurried, restrained and logical to rabies.  Here and now, as we taught you.  After all, you are not just a novice C # programmer, but a person who achieves his goals, knows how to think in abstract-spatial categories and knows the importance of integrated teaching C # programming and learning the .NET platform.  And yes!  Here's something else.  I hope, now you are not going to delude yourself now that you will learn in-depth development in C # in a couple of weeks. </habracut></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/203190/">https://habr.com/ru/post/203190/</a></p>
