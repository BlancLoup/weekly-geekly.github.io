  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Security of data stored in Google services</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  At each presentation on Google Apps, I am asked a question about the security of data stored on Google servers.  I could not immediately articulate for myself the answer to this question.  But reflecting on this, I finally had a more or less clear vision of this problem: <br>  <strong>The danger that the information will be used</strong> , if it lies with someone always has.  If the secret is known by more than one person, this is no longer a secret.  Based on this, it is necessary to choose the most reliable repository of information, understanding that the threat of getting it into third-party hands is still there.  I repeat: the question is in the probability of such an outcome. <br>  <strong>In our wonderful democratic country</strong> (RF), I personally did not order SMS-mailing about the upcoming elections, and nevertheless I get the message ‚ÄúCome to the elections‚Äù.  This seemingly harmless smska means much more than it seems at first glance;  namely, all mobile operators "merge" information about their subscribers at the first call of the state.  Unlike Google, which <a href="http://www.securitylab.ru/news/262841.php">refused to provide the US government with information about the most frequent search queries</a> .  Can you imagine the situation in our country that Yandex or Mail.ru refuse to provide information to the government?  I admit this option, but I believe very weakly.  This is what concerned the interaction with the state. <br>  <strong>Now walk through the Savelovsky market</strong> .  The traffic police databases, again cellular operators, tax, medical (for example, oncologic dispensaries, in order to follow which old man got sick, it means you can start driving up and offering bogus options with apartments to seize property) and many others.  These, in my opinion, insanely and infinitely important things, have long been publicly available in our country. <br><br>  <strong>I made the following conclusions for myself:</strong> <br><ol><li>  I am aware that Google may transfer information to third parties.  But if this information is not given to the US government, then even if it is handed over to the FBI, in the hands of Russian intruders or our gallant law enforcement agencies, it will not be soon.  And I am not afraid of FBI - I am not an international criminal. </li><li>  I am also aware of the possibility of information theft.  But this is a danger that we have been exposed to for a long time - e-mail services.  An email can be intercepted at many stages of the transfer.  And if earlier I sent the document by e-mail, and now I post it in Google Docs - then from my point of view, in terms of security, these actions are the same.  I am guided by the simple principle for myself - that which I am ready to send by e-mail, I trust Google Docs and Calendars.  All valuable information, such as documents prepared for a patent application, I will not send by e-mail, and I will not post them in Google Docs. </li></ol><br><br>  <strong>UPDATE</strong> : <br>  1. As a result of the discussion in the comments, it became clear that I had not very clearly formulated my idea that it was my personal opinion as a user.  Therefore, the first paragraph of this text I would replace with: <br>  ‚ÄúI often asked myself the question of data security when I started using Google Apps.  I thought a lot about this and came to the following explanation for myself. ‚Äù <br>  2. <a href="http://geektimes.ru/users/bobuk/" class="user_link">bobuk</a> questioned my claims, expressed in the article, regarding how states can access data from Internet services. <br>  3. In no case do I have any complaints about Yandex and Mail.ru services.  I cited them as an example only because it seemed to me that the Russian services could get access to them easier than to the American Internet services.  <a href="http://geektimes.ru/users/bobuk/" class="user_link">bobuk</a> showed the convention of state borders in this case. <br>  4. My vision of the details of the situation changes depending on the received new facts, but the main conclusion for a long time remains the same - <strong>do not put information online that you are not ready to send by e-mail</strong> .
