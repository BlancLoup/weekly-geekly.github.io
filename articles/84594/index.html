  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Circling startups</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  A start-up is a sweet word for any developer, which, it seems, has no analogues in other environments.  Knowledge multiplied by the lottery.  It‚Äôs difficult, it‚Äôs almost unpredictable, sometimes a seemingly promising project, which has a radiating potential, flies to tarry a maximum of six months after launch, and a completely delusional idea suddenly gains incredible popularity and becomes an object of investment and other tasty gingerbread for the developer. <br><br>  Any developer at least once in his life tried to create something similar.  First, the idea illuminates, which is followed by pencil drawing sketched hastily on paper.  Then, a painstaking search of similar products on the market is carried out, and along the way there is a discussion of the idea in the kitchen with his wife, and God forbid, someone will hear, immediately take the idea and realize it, and get a million. <br><br>  The paradox is that 99% of the products produced, which I call handicrafts, are somehow implemented by someone anyway, but this never stops the startup, because he always knows what can be improved and where to put the highlight;  I am always sure that <i>its</i> implementation will just shoot, <i>his</i> project will be able to pull down all those blankets that are located on other <i>similar</i> sites.

      The lion's share of crafts that have been observed lately is based on the principle ‚ÄúI will do it like this, and add <b>this</b> .‚Äù  Any functional trifle, which according to the subjective opinion of the developer, is either absolutely necessary on the website, or spoils the whole picture and only scares the potential user, as this. <br><br>  And at this very same time, there is still such an amusing nuance, as the evolution of the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãa parabola, while the functionality is rapidly increasing at first, and then flies down as quickly as possible in order to facilitate the service. <br><br>  And then the following happens: <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  <b>First there was the word</b> <br><br>  On the Internet, a product appears, for example, a service that allows you to save your links.  For example.  The author, let's call him Vasily, immediately shows off his brainchild and waits for suggestions from Google, or, at worst, from Microsoft. <br><br>  <b>Our mind gave us steel hands-hooks</b> <br><br>  A week later, someone Petya, looking at the news about start-ups, sees Vasin‚Äôs implementation and decides that everything seems to be good, but it would do well to make grouping by section for links.  Petya immediately gets to work and after a week gives his <i>start-up</i> to the audience, under the working title ‚ÄúLink Directory‚Äù <br><br>  <b>A rabid dog seven miles is not a hook</b> <br><br>  ‚ÄúSomething is not right here!‚Äù - comparing two similar projects, Kolya decides, and, without any doubt, rushes into the jet, which results in the birth of a third project, in which, among other things, - actually, links and categories, - there is an opportunity share these links with each other. <br><br>  <b>Strike while the iron is hot</b> <br><br>  ‚ÄúBut the topic is fashionable, you see, how everyone quickly ran to do it, but I‚Äôll show everyone now!‚Äù Vitya waves his fist furiously, and after 5 days he furiously scribbles a press release on his <i>start-up</i> , which is <i>better than the</i> rest because in addition to links, categories and the ability to make these links public, avatars have been added to user profiles, a friends link feed has been added, and to the heap, and this is the main feature, RSS feeds.  This is not a shame to call a work of <i>high technology</i> , and it‚Äôs time to get ready for an IPO. <br><br>  <b>On the catcher and the beast runs</b> <br><br>  In the next six months, the service is copied from project to project, overgrown with more and more saturated baubles and ryushechkami, with each Fenichka and almost every ryushechka according to the opinion of each of the subsequent authors and will get all the audience from predecessors. <br><br><ul><li>  The ability to add a screenshot to the page is added. </li><li>  Strengthened the social network where you can discuss the latest trends in the world of links </li><li>  APIs Google and Yandex are connected </li><li>  A weekly podcast about link building is being developed and released (with underlining to do or not, blue or purple, etc.) </li><li>  An expert column opens. </li><li>  Its own API is released. </li></ul><br><br>  <b>How does the heart calm down</b> <br><br>  Following is the most interesting.  After a year, it suddenly turns out that all of the above services are of no interest to anyone.  Multiple publications and analytical reports <i>suddenly</i> find out that the user does not need communities, he is not interested in the possibilities of Google Maps, he is completely on the side of the API, and it simply irritates podcasts.  He is interested only in <s>mice, their value ...</s> links and nothing more. <br><br>  And then the backward wave, when there are regular crafts and publications like "New Startup!  We made the interface as easy as possible, we removed the unnecessary functionality, which was the mistake of our predecessors, and therefore meet <i>our startup</i> , where there are only links, screenshots and groups of friends! ‚Äù <br><br>  Next up is a new startup.  Without friends. <br>  Next new.  No categories <br>  Next new.  No groups of friends. <br>  And then completely new, allowing you to add only one link per day, and is motivated by the fact that "in this way we select the best, this is a new word in startups." <br><br>  And everything returns to normal.  The circle is closed. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/84594/">https://habr.com/ru/post/84594/</a></p>
