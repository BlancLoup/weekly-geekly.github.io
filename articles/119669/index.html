  <section class="page js-page"><h1>About the advance payment system and the minus on the personal account</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  On one very pleasant day, a letter arrived to me that I owed one mobile operator (three letters with eggs (c) bash.org.ru) almost a thousand rubles.  And this, oddly enough, upset me. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  As it turned out, it all started 3 months before this letter.  In February 2011, I came to the capital of our country "to learn."  Because  were almost a week, so as not to break away from the benefits of civilization, we decided to buy a modem and, accordingly, a SIM card for it.  In the nearest shop we were sold a modem already with a connected limit.  The price of ~ 1000 rubles for the modem and the Internet month, us, who came from the province and are accustomed to high prices for the Internet, quite satisfied.  Having used this device for almost a week, we safely finished studying and passed the certification exams and went home.  I removed the modem in a box and threw it into the table and forgot about it. <br>  This could all end, but ... <br><br>  In the first days of May of this year, I received a letter in the mail, happily informing you that according to the number 916 * you have a debt in the amount of 988 rubles.  At first, I tried to understand what the number was (when I bought the modem, they didn‚Äôt even tell me what it was from him).  But since there were no other options, I began to sin on the modem.  When I came to the local office, I was surprised to learn that they had no access to the Moscow base of subscribers and could not help me. <br>  I had to go a long way: <br>  I called the support service at number 0890 where my dear young lady, not listening to my arguments, told me that due to the peculiarities of charging subscription fee from MTS, if at the beginning of the month the subscriber has a positive balance in the account (I had 2 rubles), then the subscription fee is charged fee in full and I become a debtor. <br>  Because  I was still in the operator's office, I asked the staff for a contract for the provision of communication services.  After reading the paragraph about the advance payment system I had, I asked the girl to explain how the ‚Äúminus‚Äù in the account relates to this system.  But, despite my quiet calm voice and polite treatment, the girl, having found no other explanation except for the ‚Äúsubscription fee deduction feature‚Äù, hung up the phone. <br>  I had to ask for the application form and put my complaints in writing.  In the claim, I referred to the very same clause of the agreement on the ‚Äúadvance settlement system‚Äù according to which the subscriber determines the amount of money that he agrees to allocate for the payment of operator services. <br>  After 3-4 days they called me from the company and said: Yes, an error occurred.  Debt is written off to me, and my legal 2 rubles is returned to the account.  And they insistently asked to write a statement about blocking the number. <br><br>  Findings: <br>  1. If you have a specified operator in your account (for others you need to read the contract) a negative balance, and you have an ‚Äúadvance payment system‚Äù, then boldly demand that the debt be removed from your account. <br>  2. Even such large companies are trying to get money from their subscribers.

      Ps I didn‚Äôt want to write about this case at all, but today I was pleased with another problem with this operator.  What kind of problem you can read <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/telecom/101481/">here</a> .  And since I ran into her today, I can assure you that she is still solved with a squeak.  I, by the way, already at the third stage.  The next is either blocking the number or filing an application with the court.  Need to think )) <br><br>  update <br>  At the request of <a href="http://geektimes.ru/users/milfgard/" class="user_link">Milfgard, the</a> text of the statement (I do not post the copy from the photocopy, it's horror handwriting): <br>  At the number indicated in the header, a letter was received about the debt in the amount of 989 rubles.  At this issue advance payment method.  In accordance with the agreement (rules) on the provision of services, namely, clause 12.2, I consider it inadmissible to write off funds to a ‚Äúminus‚Äù, i.e.  by transferring me to a credit method of settlement.  Please block the specified number, returning illegally debited funds to it. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/119669/">https://habr.com/ru/post/119669/</a></p>
