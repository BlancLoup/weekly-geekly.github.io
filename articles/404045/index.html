Continuing the <a href="https://geektimes.ru/post/286854/">theme</a> started by <a href="https://geektimes.ru/users/lozga/" class="user_link">lozga</a> , I want to share my own experience of using Xiaomi Mijia M365 electric scooter. <br><br>  This scooter was chosen for commuting to and from work.  Missing showers and bicycle parking at the new place of work prompted to change the bike for Chinese electric wheels.

      Looking ahead, I will say that this crown of a famous Chinese brand left a good impression. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  The idea to order directly from Aliexpress was discarded, though not on the first attempt.  Scooters - a relatively new direction Xiaomi, so the guarantee is not superfluous.  It was bought from resellers in St. Petersburg for 26 thousand rubles ($ 455 at the exchange rate for May 2017).  That is much cheaper than competitors E-TWOW S2 or Pat Cruzer. <br><br>  Wonders began from the first moment of opening the box.  The Chinese made a very beautiful and thoughtful design of the scooter, and at the same time did not think at all about its transportation, or rather the box.  The feeling is that the shoebox is stronger.  A metal scooter weighing 12 kilograms is surrounded by one layer of ordinary packaging cardboard.  The folding steering column rests against the top of the box and is the first to suffer damage.  Before buying, I had the opportunity to open several boxes, and all the scooters in them were knocked with paint on the counter in the place of the "fold".  Apart from multiple damage to the box itself. <br><br>  Scooter before first use requires simple assembly.  It is necessary to fasten the steering wheel with four screws and an allen key attached.  True, according to the old Chinese tradition, the key resource was not even enough for this.  The screws because of the applied protective paint are twisted rather tightly, and after the third screw the hexagon turned into a nice circle.  I completed the assembly with my own set of tools. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/404/161/399/4041613999444dd8b86592bd3d7c5d84.JPG"><br><br>  Included with the scooter are: charger, hose for the pump, instruction (in Chinese).  Translated instructions can be downloaded <a href="https://yadi.sk/i/wRdsK-KS3JPC9T">here</a> .  The plug from the charger, by the way, is also in Chinese format.  For our mains need an adapter.  And even better - the replacement of the power cord. <br><br>  Of course, I could not get the electric scooter out of the box and did not disassemble it.  I have this since childhood;  does not seem to be treated. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/23d/685/329/23d6853297894a619ec9d241fccd75eb.JPG"><br><br>  The lower protective cover is held on 17 screws.  Another surprise is connected with it - it is plastic.  That is, what should protect the battery compartment from damage, itself requires protection.  The network already offers a <a href="https://ecodrift.ru/shop/prodecklight-zashhita-deki-samokata-xiaomi-mijia-scooter-kopiya/">metal</a> replacement for the standard cover.  In the presence of direct hands and tools, you can make a duralumin equivalent, using a plastic lid as a template.  On the forums they write that so far there are no known cases of a broken bottom.  In my opinion, the key word here - known.  I on the very first trip because of the lack of experience, hit this lid strongly on the sidewalk.  I have become more careful, but, I'm afraid, the lid may not bear the second strike.  So the plans - its replacement. <br><br>  Under the lid there is a controller board and a battery pack made up of 30 LG 18650 Li-ion cells with a capacity of 2600 mAh.  The batteries are connected according to the 10S3P scheme, forming a 36 volt battery, 7800 mAh. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/314/ea7/aef/314ea7aef40d4e49a8e4a9702bc392b1.JPG"><br><br>  Both the controller and the unit are additionally protected from dust and spray with plastic lining.  The controller itself is screwed to the metal case through the thermal paste for improved cooling. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/4da/5c2/cda/4da5c2cdac4d47f8b6eee5e0ac07304e.jpg"><br><br>  On the steering wheel, the charge indication LEDs and the power button are placed. <br><br>  Four LEDs indicate charge level.  When all lights up, the maximum charge.  A decrease in charge below 85% causes the upper LED to flash.  When it goes out, the charge remains less than 70%.  And so on, each subsequent blinks first, then goes out.  Very convenient, with one glance you can estimate, "how much is left for you."  If there is one blinking LED, the battery needs charging.  When the battery is completely discharged, the scooter turns off and only coasting is available.  Resistance to the movement of the engine does not, therefore, in extreme cases, you can push yourself to the destination. <br><br>  The declared ECO mode is activated by ‚Äúdouble clicking‚Äù on the power button, while the lower LED lights up in green.  Acceleration becomes smoother, the maximum speed is limited to 18 km / h.  The mode was conceived for teaching novices and measuring characteristics for advertising leaflets.  For the majority of owners not only do not use this mode, but even are dissatisfied with the existing limit of 25 km / h.  IVF is also disabled by double pressing. <br><br>  A call on the steering wheel is a necessary thing, but it needs some work.  It happens that "out of the box" he does not call, or calls too quietly and shortly.  The problem is easily solved by bending the metal tab in the right direction. <br><br>  The 1W front LED headlamp illuminates the way from 5 to 8 meters in front and makes the ride more comfortable in the dark.  Reflective strips are located on the sides, making the scooter more visible in the headlights.  Also for safety, the rear brake light comes on and flashes when braking, informing you of a speed reduction. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/aa0/6ad/0d2/aa06ad0d27944754b849a7cfa61b964f.JPG"><br><br>  By the way, about the brakes.  Rather, about the brake system.  When you press the brake lever, the scooter starts regenerative engine braking, recharging the batteries.  Pressing the handle all the way additionally activates the rear disc brake (indispensable when driving with the scooter off).  Parallel braking is controlled by an electronic anti-lock system E-ABS, which protects the wheels from slipping.  All together makes the stopping distance very short and effective, from maximum speed to zero - 4 meters.  After the bike I had to learn to brake again, constantly stopped too early. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/eb3/0ac/eca/eb30aceca8d2464183f9f3ecd2a1f3d6.png"><br><br>  There are two smartphone apps that connect to the scooter via Bluetooth - <br>  MiHome and Ninebot.  The first, MiHome, is a native Chinese from Xiaomi.  It was not possible to establish it, they write on the forums that the problem is being solved by changing the location to China.  Second, Ninebot fell immediately and without problems.  It allows you to change the settings, update the firmware, shows the current speed and the remaining charge, keeps statistics of the distance traveled.  The most useful feature, which for some reason is turned off by default, is cruise control.  It is very convenient, the scooter itself maintains the set speed, it is not necessary to constantly press on the throttle. <br><br>  The protective function Zero-Start is associated with the throttle stick.  To move off, you need to give the scooter the initial speed, and only then click on it.  Otherwise, the engine will not work.  This is done to protect against accidental pressing.  The only pity is that the function is not disabled. <br><br>  The first trip left an unforgettable impression.  This feeling of flight, when a slight pressure on the throttle leads to dynamic acceleration and forward movement.  Low noise and good handling.  The model is not yet common, so the attention of others is increased.  Starting from my first trip until today, several times a day, people interested in the electric scooter come to me.  And not only fit at traffic lights, but also catching up while driving.  Cyclists, of course.  The set of questions is standard - how much is it, how much battery is enough, there are even courageous comrades, asking for a ride right away.  The age varies from students to pensioners, and this only confirms the relevance of the scooter, which pleases. <br><br>  The wheels are 8.5 inches (21.6 cm) pneumatic, there are no other additional shock absorbers.  And although the forums enthusiastically write about the softness of the course, everything is subjective.  When traveling, there is every pebble, every bull that has fallen under the wheel.  Riding on paving slabs and on unevenly laid pavement slabs (I almost never met exactly laid ones) turns into a vibroattraction.  Either endure or slow down to a snail.  And even the patency, at the wheels of this diameter it is none, from the word at all.  Any obstacle on the road higher or deeper than 3 cm causes dismount and lift a scooter.  About the sidewalk curbs, I'm not talking. <br><br>  Vibration from traveling on uneven roads requires periodic checking of screw fasteners.  The strength of the shaking can be judged by indirect signs - after a week of trips, I unscrewed and lost the cap on the nipple camera.  It's good that the size coincides with the bike, can be purchased at the respective stores. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/169/647/aff/169647affa6c4d4a9c60d50315734f4f.JPG"><br><br>  For carrying the scooter quickly and conveniently folds.  The process itself is shown in stages in the photo above, everything is simple and does not require explanation.  What is even more convenient is the non-folding handles.  All together gives a rigid structure and, as a result, the absence of backlash. <br><br>  The level of dust and moisture protection is stated at IP54.  Those.  diving with him is not recommended, but getting into the rain can only get wet by the ‚Äúdriver‚Äù.  However, comparing with a bicycle, riding in rain and dirt pollutes the scooter much more.  It is a scooter, the wings cope with their purpose, and nothing gets on their backs on their feet. <br><br>  Riding a bike in the rain generally requires pre-applying moisture-resistant lubricant to the chain - and wiping the frame with a damp cloth at the end.  A scooter, such an impression, collects all the available dirt along the way.  Then either wash it in the bathroom under the shower, or wait for the sticking problems to fall off ... <br><br>  Therefore, if on a bike only heavy rain stopped from the trip, then the scooter makes you wonder whether to refuse to go even after the last light rain. <br>  Although, maybe, I'm such a perfectionist to the purity. <br><br>  The manufacturer claims a maximum mileage of 30 km.  I was in perfect conditions (lack of mountains and wind, the weight of the average Chinese) managed to drive only 24 km.  Actual conditions will make adjustments to the distance from the outlet to the outlet.  For example, a strong head wind of 4-5 m / s will reduce this value by about a third.  In winter, at a temperature of -10 or less, the capacity drops by about half. <br><br>  It is worth noting that even 24 km is in most cases sufficient.  Especially if it is taken for trips to work, where it is possible to recharge.  In order not to constantly carry a charge with you, you can purchase a second set of charger. <br><br>  On Aliexpress you can buy almost all the necessary parts for repair, there are specialized shops.  They sell engines, battery controllers, fenders, camera kits with tires and more.  By the way, about the cameras, they will certainly be needed.  In the network periodically there are reports of cases of damage to the rear camera.  This problem has bypassed me.  At the manufacturer‚Äôs <a href="http://bbs.xiaomi.cn/t-13439612">forum they</a> write that the reason for that is insufficient pressure in the cells, which causes premature wear and subsequent damage. <br><br>  There is also a table with the recommended tire pressure depending on the weight: <br><table><tbody><tr><th>  Load kg </th><th>  Front wheel, psi </th><th>  Rear wheel, psi </th></tr><tr><td>  50-70 </td><td>  35-40 </td><td>  40-50 </td></tr><tr><td>  70-90 </td><td>  40-45 </td><td>  45-55 </td></tr><tr><td>  90-100 </td><td>  45-50 </td><td>  50-60 </td></tr><tr><td>  &gt; 100 </td><td>  50-55 </td><td>  60-65 </td></tr></tbody></table><br>  To convert PSI to atmosphere, you need to divide by 14.7. <br><br>  The Xiaomi scooter is officially nowhere, except China, not yet sold.  However, in major cities we have already actively offered this model, there is a choice where to get it.  By the summer is expected to release an international version.  I hope the characteristics will only improve, and minor bugs will be eliminated.  Indeed, in general, Xiaomi has turned out very decent model for a low price. <br><br>  <strong>Advantages:</strong> <br><br><ul><li>  Low price (against competitors) </li><li>  Stylish appearance </li><li>  Regeneration during braking </li><li>  Cruise control </li><li>  Disc brake </li></ul><br>  <strong>Disadvantages:</strong> <br><br><ul><li>  Low-power 250W motor </li><li>  Plastic bottom </li><li>  Trip distance </li></ul></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/404045/">https://habr.com/ru/post/404045/</a></p>
