  <section class="page js-page"><h1>GetPage.name - another unnecessary service?</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Good time of day. <br><br><h5>  Introduction </h5><br>  I want to present my latest project to the public, or rather, GetPage.name web service. <br><br>  I am not a programmer, although I have been doing websites and services in PHP for more than 10 years.  When there is an urgent need for some specific function, then immediately go to google.  If the results are zero, then I do it for myself and upload to the network for general use. 
      <br>
        <script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>
        <ins class="adsbygoogle"
          style="display:block; text-align:center;"
          data-ad-layout="in-article"
          data-ad-format="fluid"
          data-ad-client="ca-pub-6974184241884155"
          data-ad-slot="8945601208"></ins>

      This time, we needed a feature to pick names for FaceBook Pages.  The built-in function in Facebook itself was more than satisfactory, until I wanted to speed up the process and make a group name check.  I did not find the service and, following the "ancient" tradition, I began to write code. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h5>  Traffic and search </h5><br>  In general, if you deviate from the topic, then among internet marketers there is now a very big trend on FB Pages.  They even experiment: they register FB Page and a domain with the same name at the same time, upload the same content, launch it into the network and see who is faster indexed by Google.  Results: 7 out of 10 wins FB Pages.  Probably because initially Facebook has high PR and ‚Äúgives a lot of juice‚Äù for its pages. <br><br>  Also this year was an interesting moment.  At one of the dot com sites was statistics on the number of search queries.  So, there it was indicated that Google 48%, FaceBook 52%.  This means that people began to use more search through Facebook.  Is it true or not, I do not know, but listened. <br><br><h5>  One site - one function </h5><br>  Exactly what I love.  This is how GetPage.name appeared.  It performs one function - check if the name is free to register with the Facebook system.  You can check in two ways: either type keywords one at a time, or use Bulk Search (mass search), where you can check up to 50 names at a time. <br><br>  It is because of the mass check and the site was made.  It is very convenient.  Suppose I had a list of key words that have all the necessary facts of success.  I started checking for the presence of domains on this list, it was easy, since there are sites that allow you to check many domains at once.  When it came to checking the names on FaceBook, the process stopped me. <br><br><h5>  Interface </h5><br>  The interface was chosen in the style of Metro, I really liked this approach to the design and just applied it to the web site. <br><br>  At the top there is a search field, in the middle of the tooltip, on the right there is a button for Donations (I forgot how to correctly say in Russian), contacts are below.  Everything is simple and clear. <br><br>  By the way, I‚Äôll add that I always wanted to buy an SSL certificate and install it, see how it works and what the process is.  That's it in this project and tried.  Now every user can be sure that no one but himself will see the list of keywords. <br><br><h5>  Is it necessary? </h5><br>  The service performs only 1 function and it will be needed mainly for internet marketers, and this was actually the bias during creation. <br><br>  In order to somehow contain the traffic, a restriction was made - you can check up to 50 names at a time.  This was done for a simple reason - I want to leave the service free. <br><br><h5>  In conclusion... </h5><br>  I will listen to all the criticism, advice, and I will accept as a gift any information that somehow enriches with knowledge.  Thank you for your time. <br><br>  I wish you all brilliant ideas and successful projects! <br><br>  Link to the website: <a href="https://getpage.name/">https://getpage.name</a> <br><br>  PS: I apologize in advance for my Russian, because  I have been living in England for a long time and started to forget the language a little. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/133670/">https://habr.com/ru/post/133670/</a></p>
