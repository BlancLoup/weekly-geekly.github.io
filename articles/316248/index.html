Hackathon was also supported by one of the departments of the Kiev National University and Imagination Technologies, the developer of the PowerVR graphics processor inside the Apple iPhone.  The result of the hackathon exceeded expectations (more on this below), and now plans are being developed to repeat it in other places, in particular in Tomsk or Novosibirsk. <br><br> <a href="https://vk.com/wall-79153528_2464"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/090/4f9/7ad/0904f97ad20b1efc968d11d4cfc71503.jpg"></a> <br><br>  A hackathon at KPI by <a href="http://www.silicon-russia.com/2016/01/04/mipsfpga-how-to-start/">MIPSfpga</a> was experimental in the sense that usually participants either simply program (for example, SaaS solutions) in hackathons, or make devices from ready-made fixed circuits and program them (Arduino, STM32 Discovery).  Here, the participants wrote the program and developed the scheme, the interface unit at the Register Transfer Level (RTL), and then embedded this unit into the synthesized system with the <a href="https://imagination-technologies-cloudfront-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/documentation/MD00942-2B-microAptivUP-SUM-01.02.pdf">MIPS microAptiv UP</a> processor core and the AHB-Lite bus, and implemented this system in FPGA.

But how does such a project start? <br><br>  In the past 25 years, chip design has most often been written in the Verilog hardware description language ([previously] in Europe and among the military - VHDL), after which a special program (logic synthesis) turns the design into a graph of wires and logical primitives, another program (static timing analysis) informs the designer whether it fits into the speed budget, and the third program (place-and-route) lays out this design on the chip site. <br><br>  When the design goes through all the stages: coding on the chain, debugging, verification, synthesis, static timing analysis, floorplanning, place-n-route, parasitics extraction, etc.  - it turns out a file called GDSII, which is sent to the factory, and the factory bakes chips.  The most famous factories of this type are owned by Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company or TSMC. </blockquote> <a href="http://www.silicon-russia.com/public_materials/2016_11_04_one_day_mipsfpga_connected_mcu_materials_public_for_the_website/04_present_nanometer_asic_seminar/dna.rus.2016.MIPS.pdf"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/f5d/016/3b9/f5d0163b9bd4712f15d0a5b8339703b3.png"></a> <br>  From the post on Habrahabr <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/post/250511/">How to start developing iron using FPGA - step by step instructions</a> : <br><br><blockquote>  In its simplest form, an FPGA consists of a matrix of homogeneous cells, each function of which can be changed using multiplexers connected to the bits of the configuration memory.

The protocol variant used by the sensor is fairly simple;  Its description in the documentation from the site of the manufacturer Digilent takes only two paragraphs of text: <br><br><blockquote>  <a href="http://digilentinc.com/Data/Products/PMOD-ALS/PmodALS_RM.pdf">PDF</a> <br><br> <a href="http://digilentinc.com/Data/Products/PMOD-ALS/PmodALS_RM.pdf"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/bbd/b18/d02/bbdb18d02ec30e047de548453b5d8dbd.png"><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/76e/a6a/fbc/76ea6afbcd4b84b877b25b5c948df9fe.png"></a> </blockquote><br>  Note that the Sensor Protocol (SPI) is serial, and the processor bus protocol (AHB-Lite) is parallel.  Compare: <br><br>  Using the SPI protocol, data is transmitted and received, bit by bit.  This saves the number of signals, which is important for protocols transferring data between chips: <br><br> <a href="https://reference.digilentinc.com/pmod:communication_protocols:spi"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/a89/5c0/960/a895c09607336a94541d278f76865d8f.png"></a> <br><br>  <a href="http://mazsola.iit.uni-miskolc.hu/~drdani/docs_arm/IHI0033A_AMBA3_AHB_Lite.pdf">Using the AHB-Lite</a> protocol, data bits are transmitted in parallel.  In addition, the data in this protocol is associated with the address, and the address bits are also transmitted in parallel.  Here are the diagrams for some of the read and write transaction signals on the AHB-Lite bus: <br><br>  Reading: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/28b/e48/4fe/28be484feb28c02c624d896b38469bbd.png"><br><br>  Record: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/035/30e/ac0/03530eac0461092ebe545ffe0b3e5a63.png"><br><br>  To integrate the sensor into the system, you need to design three components: <br><br><ol><li>  A hardware module that receives data using the SPI protocol and stores it in some register of the current value.  The code on the verification for this module is <a href="">in the file</a> , as well as below. <br><br></li><li>  The code on the chain for transferring data from this register over the AHB-Lite bus to the processor core for data processing by software, so to speak glue code.  It can be found in <a href="https://github.com/MIPSfpga/mipsfpga-plus">the directory files</a> , if you search the string <i>`ifdef MFP_DEMO_LIGHT_SENSOR.</i>  . <br><br></li><li>  Software running on a processor core that receives data from the light sensor and somehow uses it, for example, displays the light value on a 7-segment display on the FPGA board.  This is a small C program that is compiled using the standard GCC toolchain and linked with initialization code written in assembly language - see <a href="https://github.com/MIPSfpga/mipsfpga-plus/tree/master/programs/01_light_sensor">here</a> . </li></ol><br>  The code on the chain for the hardware module that receives data using the SPI protocol and stores it in the current value register: <br><br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/2c2/8f1/0c3/2c28f10c359d606717478d421176fc02.png"></a> <br><br>  Here is the scheme for this code during logical synthesis using Altera Quartus II version 16.0 (after analysis, but before mapping and optimization): <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/7cd/4e7/c72/7cd4e7c7244e814363e0603a72a8b783.png"><br><br><h2>  Conclusions and future plans </h2><br>  The MIPSfpga hackathon turned out to be an even more interesting event for all participating than expected: <br><br><ol><li>  Hackathon was not very easy - not all came to the finish line, but less than half of the teams </li><li>  Hackathon was not very difficult - two teams came confidently, another one or two - with some stretch </li><li>  In the process of the hackathon, the participants made a bunch of mistakes for both beginners and more advanced developers, in particular: <br><br><ol><li>  Newbie Trivial Error: Misinterpreting I / Os </li><li>  Misunderstanding of the mechanism of Verilog operation: Shift by clock cycle due to misunderstanding of the concept of delta cycles and waiting for an immediate change of the external signal inside the <i>always-</i> combinational block in response to assignment to the signal on which the external signal depends on continuous assignment </li><li>  Misunderstanding of the Register Transfer Level Methodology (RTL): use of control signals in <i>‚Äúalways @ (posedge control_signal) ...‚Äù</i> instead of <i>‚Äúalways @ (posedge clock) ... if (control_signal) ...‚Äù</i> </li><li>  Wrong timing constraints </li><li>  Found even an error in the code of the MIPSfpga package! </li></ol></li></ol><br>  Therefore, there is an idea to repeat such a Hackathon in other countries.  For repetition in Russia: in Moscow there are 16 Altera / Terasic DE0-CV boards that can be used for such events.  In Kazakhstan and Ukraine, you can also come up with something.  If you have ideas, please report in the comments. <br><br> <a href="https://www.facebook.com/belka.space.kpi/photos/a.1382284962070242.1073741828.1381472605484811/1422510381381033/%3Ftype%3D1%26theater"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/ee1/2f1/5eb/ee12f15eb076d86342758b38514b916c.jpg"></a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/316248/">https://habr.com/ru/post/316248/</a></p>
