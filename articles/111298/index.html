I would like to promote the development of the company ( <a href="http://exadel.com/">Exade</a> l) in which I work, because  I am also involved in this project. <br>  So, Tiggr is a tool for prototyping and creating user interface layouts. <br>  I'll start by listing the main features of the application: <br><ul><li>  A decent set of controls.  It is worth noting that in Tiggr recently, in addition to the desktop interface elements, UI controls for mobile phones have appeared. </li><li>  Tiggr is an online application, so access to your project can be obtained from any workstation without installing additional software - just a browser. </li><li>  Customizability - all controls have additional settings that allow you to control the view, position, etc.  component. </li><li>  A set of containers for the formation of the layout. </li><li>  Convenient (in my opinion) approach to working with pictures. </li><li>  Collaboration support: several users can simultaneously work on one project, layout. </li><li>  From static screens you can get a dynamic, clickable prototype. </li><li>  Manage users and access to the project. </li></ul><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  I'll tell you about the main points in more detail. <br><h2>  Controls </h2><br>  Pallet web, desktop controls looks like this: <br>  <a href="">gotiggr.com/resources/img/features/web-controls-draganddrop.png</a> <br>  Mobile control pallets, which is activated if you select Screen Properties&gt; Screen type&gt; Mobile on the property panel. <br>  <a href="">gotiggr.com/resources/img/features/mobile-controls-palette.png</a> <br>  Remarkably, some of the controls are dynamic.  I will explain with examples: different tabs on the Tab Panel can contain different content, while in the layout mode you can switch between tabs;  the calendar opens and closes;  combobox opens. <br>  As for the properties, for example, buttons, they are quite enough for basic manipulations.  I would like to focus on such properties as Fit and Round Corners.  The first property is used to stretch the controls along the edges of the container, the second rounds the corners of the element. <br>  <a href="http://gotiggr.com/views/assets/asset-1720">gotiggr.com/views/assets/asset-1720</a> <br><h2>  Layout </h2><br>  For the organization of the layout, the location of the UI elements on the page, the Tiggr developers offer a good set of containers.  For containers reserved for a separate pallet.  Pallet includes: <br><ol><li>  Panel - the panel dialog box. </li><li>  Vertical, Horizontal, Flow box - a container that has elements inside it vertically, horizontally and in order limited to the right edge of the container. </li><li>  Grid Panel - allows you to build a table grid. </li><li>  Tab Panel - a panel with several tabs. </li></ol><br>  In addition to horizontal, vertical and ‚Äústreaming‚Äù positioning, absolute positioning is also provided, since  as the element was ‚Äúthrown‚Äù, so it will be located irrespective of the container and other elements. <br><h2>  Collaboration support </h2><br>  So how can Tiggr business analytics?  The key feature of the Tiger is a collaboration.  In real time, several people can view and edit the same layout.  In order to add users to the project you just need to send them an invitation. <br>  Quite often it happens that the members of the team working on the project are geographically located in different places.  Tiggr allows you to combine them in one place, not only for discussion, but also for co-editing.  From my own experience I will say that it is easier to move, say, a control to a certain place than to tell 2 minutes that it should be there and there.  In addition to the work of the team itself, Tiggr can serve as a presentation "platform" in the communication team-customer.  Having arranged a presentation, you can negotiate on the fly, edit the layout and do not arrange an additional session to clarify that we are on the same page after the previous rally.  To improve communication, Tiggr has a built-in chat, although I used Skype to communicate and clarify requirements, since  voice is always faster.  Of course, you shouldn‚Äôt narrow down the list of people for whom Tiggr could become an application that makes life easier for business analysts - everyone who communicates with a remote team, a customer, etc.  will appreciate the benefits of Tiggr, I just wanted to draw the attention of colleagues to this application :). <br><h2>  How to improve UX at the design stage? </h2><br>  Another advantage of Tiggr is the ability to liven up a static layout.  On such elements as the button, link and image, you can ‚Äúhang‚Äù the transition to other project screens, so you get a working model of the application.  In order to generate a prototype, you need to select Open in the Web Preview menu.  After that, the HTML prototype will open in a new browser tab.  Above - a drop-down menu in which a list of all pages and with which you can navigate through the pages. <br><br><h2>  A spoon of tar </h2><br>  Cons from <a href="http://analyst.by/">analyst.by</a> : <br><ol><li>  The application is not yet completely stable;  when using a number of defects. </li><li>  A very modest palette of components, which includes only the most basic controls. </li><li>  The lack of some basic features for editing and positioning components, which significantly reduces the speed of work with the application compared to the more powerful and recognized tools for this purpose. </li></ol><br><br>  Website: <a href="http://gotiggr.com/">gotiggr.com</a> <br>  Additional infa is on the blog: <a href="http://blog.gotiggr.com/">blog.gotiggr.com</a> <br>  Demo video: <a href="">gotiggr.com/public/login.seam?cid=60579#tiggr_videos</a>
