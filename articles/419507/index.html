All the capabilities of the ‚ÄúX‚Äù platform are implemented in the new Designer X. The only difference is that the Picaso Designer X printer is a printer with 1 extruder, for printing with one material. <br><br>  Let's look at the new product in more detail: <br><br>  First of all, the appearance of the printer has changed.  The style of the case, with all its curves and advantages, was borrowed from Picaso Designer X PRO.  The case itself is made of composite aluminum, and that <b>IMPORTANT is</b> no longer a carrier as in the previous model.  In the case there are 2 removable panels for installing 2 coils with plastic. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/63c/fab/cbd/63cfabcbd82fe8342a2b0fae261d68b4.png" alt="image"><br><br>  All this suggests that this is the first printer from PICASO 3D which implies UPGRADE to the older model X PRO.  This fact brings Designer X to a whole new level among 3D printers with 1st extruder.  The manufacturer provides an opportunity to try all the latest technologies in the base model and, if necessary, upgrade the class of your printer by paying extra for UPGRADE.  When you need to print two materials.  The cost of UPGRADE has not yet been named, but to have such an opportunity is at least an excellent protection for end-user investments, especially at the start of any business where a 3D printer is required. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/436/3e5/94f/4363e594f6e39708a3019a1deb122a19.png" alt="image"><br><br>  All the mechanics are kept on a separate steel frame, which allows to achieve the ideal vibration resistance and rigidity of the whole structure. <br><br>  Overall dimensions of the new Designer X (without packaging) <b>49 x 43 x 39 cm</b> . <br><br>  Compact size allows you to place it anywhere. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/a35/d3e/efc/a35d3eefc089074d24f42e36e56d8d8d.png" alt="image"><br><br>  The front door opens up, as well as in the previous model, the manufacturer added a gasket for high-quality sound insulation and heat insulation. <br><br>  The working chamber is completely closed on all sides.  What is very important when printing with high-temperature plastics. <br><br>  <b>Let's take a closer look at the basic technical aspects of the new 3 D PICASO Designer X printer:</b> <br><br>  <b>Kinematic diagram of the 3D printer PICASO Designer X</b> <br><br>  The kinematics of a new 3D printer, like all PICASO 3D machines, is the company's own development.  The mechanics are based on double cylindrical shafts with a diameter of 10 and 8 mm. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/8de/b91/040/8deb91040c7e906f09cfa4c02532c3b2.png" alt="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/f9f/b6e/14c/f9fb6e14cd0640e2c3f16126eb81eb9b.png" alt="image"><br><br>  Z axis - 12 mm double cylindrical shafts are installed.  The movement of the desktop along the Z axis is carried out through ballscrews.  The drive along the axes X and Y - works by means of stepping motors and timing belts.  Everything is quite familiar. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/e1c/f3a/b78/e1cf3ab7807aedd146d0ff609bfbc56e.png" alt="image"><br><br>  <b>PICASO Designer X 3D Printer Extruder</b> <br><br>  This is a completely new extruder, nothing to do with the extruder from the previous model - NO.  By and large, the Picaso Designer X extruder uses proven technical solutions from PICASO Designer X PRO.  The extruder is designed to operate in a wide temperature range.  No Teflon inserts.  They do not withstand work with engineering plastics.  The plastic feed mechanism has also changed (the plastic feed angle to the extruder is not as sharp as it was on the previous PICASO DESIGNER).  This allows you to seamlessly use fragile materials, such as WOOD.  A special plastic feed guide, taken from the Designer X PRO printhead, allows you to work with flexible materials. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/0aa/057/be4/0aa057be4f7069474252dfc85d0792ff.png" alt="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/c79/63d/79c/c7963d79cad4bb13bdf14cce91d55f79.png" alt="image"><br><br>  The maximum extruder temperature is 410 ¬∞ C.  This is please the steepest indicator among all personal 3D-printers working on FDM technology.  The ability to work at these temperatures allows you to use Picaso Designer X for printing engineering plastics with high strength and refractory characteristics.  Previously, printing such materials was available only on industrial 3D-printers worth from $ 20,000. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/233/9db/a4e/2339dba4eecca193423e33d3fe4c4bd8.png" alt="image"><br><br>  <b>Control electronics for PICASO Designer X 3D printer</b> <br><br>  The 3D printer PICASO Designer X has received a completely new control board that is the company's own design by PICASO3D.  Nothing to do with amateur Arduino boards - NO.  The new board is based on the ARM CORTEX M4 processor.  Power reserve allows - to process complex 3D printing algorithms, without glitches and inhibitions.  This is especially true for long-term 3D printing.  Also, do not forget that the power of the CPU allows you to constantly expand the auxiliary functions of a 3D printer to automate the work.  We draw your attention to the fact that the manufacturer PICASO 3D constantly updates the software of all printers of the ‚ÄúX‚Äù line complementing the list of consumables profiles, improvements and upgrades to the auxiliary systems of the 3D printer. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/da9/735/0a6/da97350a61398bb1d62a650176b3d772.png" alt="image"><br><br>  <b>PICASO Designer X 3D Printer Work Platform</b> <br><br>  The desktop is an aluminum platform with removable glass on the magnets.  Maximum heating temperature up to 140 ¬∞ C.  That is enough to maintain adhesion and temperature balance inside the working chamber for almost all plastics sold on the market. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/9e4/8ef/da4/9e48efda427e1eb8a6c9d37b7655a3d7.png" alt="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/45e/9f1/e14/45e9f1e14194b7705fc18cf4e971b8b0.png" alt="image"><br><br>  The wide range of operating temperatures of the extruder (up to 410 ¬∞ C) and the printing platform (up to 140 ¬∞ C) allows you to not limit yourself in the choice of printing material.  Making the 3D printer PICASO DESIGNER X - a universal machine for working with all plastics. <br><br>  <b>PICASO Designer X 3D Printer Management Screen</b> <br><br>  The screen of the printer has also changed completely, and with it many new and useful systems have been added.  The menu is completely in Russian.  It would be strange not to see the Russian language from the Russian manufacturer, and thanks to the animated icons on the screen, even a novice will understand it. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/6a4/c1d/6bc/6a4c1d6bcc4c19c427649514bab4a50d.png" alt="image"><br><br>  <b>PICASO Designer X 3D Printer Automation Systems</b> <br><br>  In the new 3D-printer PICASO Designer X - all the automation systems that are used in PICASO 3D printers working on the platform "X" have appeared. <br><br>  Namely: <br><br>  <b>Auto-calibration of the working platform</b> - after buying a printer, you don‚Äôt need to worry about whether you calibrated the 3D printer correctly.  After switching to the network, follow the instructions on the screen, the printer will set everything up. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/424/95b/2da/42495b2da77d7a15952fa5745ed8b052.png" alt="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/3ec/833/3e3/3ec8333e3da4f2a6198660130e4105be.png" alt="image"><br><br>  <b>The system of profiles for different types of plastic</b> - it is no longer necessary to prepare a print job for a specific type of material each time; when installing plastic, the system will check with you what material is used and automatically change all the necessary parameters. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/805/c63/e4c/805c63e4c6a33f8a3526e786472d1e69.png" alt="image"><br><br>  <b>The control of the material</b> will avoid marriage.  There will no longer be such cases when you ran out of plastic and the printer printed idle.  The system will notify you in advance, thus you will be always ready for this and will not lose much time.  But plastic breakage is not a very frequent event.  But clogging can happen more often, for example because of the unstable diameter of the thread.  The plastic feed control system will immediately notice changes in the feed and will launch an automatic cleaning algorithm.  If this does not help, the printer will pause printing and wait for operator intervention. <br><br>  But that's not all.  The new control system can track any problems with plastic.  Including unstable diameter and entanglement in the coil.  Without control systems, such problems led to faulty printing and downtime.  What could take a lot of time.  Now the printer, if a problem is detected, will pause, and after the cause is removed, you can continue to work. <br><br>  <b>For example:</b> <br><br>  If you deliberately break off the plastic - Designer X will immediately come up with an error and the backlight will turn yellow, the corresponding inscription will appear on the screen. <br><br>  And if you keep the plastic forcibly, the printer will pause, the backlight will turn yellow, the screen will read ‚Äúnozzle cleaning‚Äù, then the automatic cleaning process will follow, the backlight will turn white again and 3D printing will continue. <br><br>  <b>Part position control system.</b>  Now in the new Designer X, if overpressure affects the desktop, then the part has become unstuck and presses on the table.  The printer pauses and asks to check the part.  Control is carried out by special sensors. <br><br>  <b>The control system of the first layer</b> works in the same way as in Designer X PRO, depending on the material used, the printer itself calculates the required height of the first layer between the nozzle and the table for better adhesion.  After all, this moment by and large affects the success of the entire 3D printing. <br><br>  <b>An Ethernet network interface</b> makes it possible to combine all your printers into one productive FDM farm.  It will be possible to allocate a queue of jobs to available equipment and remotely monitor the status of all devices. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/cfe/79f/46c/cfe79f46c23f780b5373be79bcc5bde4.png" alt="image"><br><br>  <b>PICASO Designer X 3D Printer Software</b> <br><br>  3D printer Designer X has switched to a completely new software, familiar to us from Designer X PRO - this is POLYGON X. <br><br>  The program is completely Russified.  Designed exclusively for 3D printers PICASO 3D.  Due to this, users get such advantages as an intuitive interface, G-code creation algorithms optimized for PICASO 3D printers, unification for the entire line of printers running on platform X (the ability to centrally manage multiple PICASO printers from one computer and from one program). <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/8ae/1e2/519/8ae1e2519153d7da697e077f4cd9d440.png" alt="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/8a0/cca/a94/8a0ccaa94020ffca35ca4285f38d668b.png" alt="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/302/542/ce9/302542ce97f7664de2e3e0e63e327a00.png" alt="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/315/c3f/678/315c3f678a4a345979b084ee5bcf3c9e.png" alt="image"><br><br>  <b>Examples of printing on a PICASO Designer X 3D printer:</b> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/cf4/791/c07/cf4791c072cf8f47d0e1c9753fd7fa64.png" alt="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/25c/6f2/946/25c6f29461036990d37c76ef2a2fbb30.png" alt="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/5d2/8e8/a22/5d28e8a22cdb476de1e1c9e6341a1cb2.png" alt="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/361/fd1/640/361fd1640d54ccdb52ae12e64ba0c495.png" alt="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/c83/eea/6c0/c83eea6c006846ac6144b735e27327af.png" alt="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/48e/796/556/48e796556ef86cab0f8e78e68b3eafe9.png" alt="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/492/423/a32/492423a32d8058030d661b09eb821c29.png" alt="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/5aa/f0c/70c/5aaf0c70cb76ecbf2e8c71b49fdfd046.png" alt="image"><br><br>  <b>Findings:</b> <br><br>  The new Picaso Designer X surpasses its predecessor in everything, and this is not surprising, because PICASO 3D, strive to ensure that each printer is better than the previous one.  If we talk about the scope of this 3D-printer, then there are a lot of them: <br><br><ol><li>  Thanks to the friendly software in Russian language - the printer is suitable for education </li><li>  Due to 3D printing automation systems - PICASO Designer X is suitable for the novice user. </li><li>  The presence of a high-temperature extruder capable of working with plastics at a temperature of 410 ¬∞ C and makes this 3D printer indispensable in the production of functional products. </li><li>  Upgrade ability to the older model X PRO.
