      The next step in the implementation of our project is to find the best sales channels for Made in Russia products in the challenging environment of stagnant purchasing power. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h4>  Domestic network sales channels </h4><br>  In practice, the choice of promotion of DO-RA line devices was limited by a number of factors peculiar to our investment opportunities, combined with network retail features and above all: the price of network entry, the possibility of consulting support in selling goods to the consumer, the size of the audience coverage and network commission fees, return periods money for the goods sold, advertising budget. <br><br>  In the Russian Internet space, the main e-commerce market players operating non-stop were chosen: OZON, GADGET, CSN Retail and others, where the first mini batches of our goods were sent for review. <br><br>  Then, representatives of the DO-RA product distributor started dialogue on product promotion in networks of cellular retailers, and in particular, negotiations with the Svyaznoy company and its network of offline stores, in aggregate consisting of more than 5,700 salons (monobrand + franchise).  Svyaznoy agreed to take the first hundred DO-RA products for a sample for its C-Store.ru network. <br><br>  Also, negotiations were held on the promotion and sale of DO-RA products in networks owned by other large companies, such as: Megaphone - 5350 salons (monobrand + franchise + 50% of Euroset salons), Beeline - 5000 salons (monobrand + franchise) and Tele- 2, which at the end of 2018, in aggregate, there were about 15.000 stores of communication.  Negotiations began with specialized electronics stores: M-Video, Eldorado and others. <br><br>  It is important to know that in addition to the arrangements for the sale of devices with the retailer, there are a number of features for the "entry" into their network, which should be considered.  For example, the commission of retail chains, which can vary in the range: from 15% to 30% of the value of goods in retail, that is, on the virtual shelf of a store.  By the way, virtual world networks work on the upper border of the commission: Google Play and the Apple Store, taking a fixed 30% from each purchase of users in their online markets.  At the same time, the initial contributions of owners of goods on Google Play - $ 29 for registering an account, a contribution to the Apple Store $ 99 per year. <br>  However, there are champions of commission - some Russian retailers who ask for up to 40-50% of retail, which is the edge of the profitability of sales of any product.  We immediately refused such offers. <br><br>  In addition, we must not forget about the refund period for the goods sold, which, as standard, in Russian retail, is from 3 to 6 months.  At the same time, for some retailers, a systematic delay in the return of money can reach from 1 to 2 months in addition to the refund period specified in the supply agreement. <br><br>  Foreign retailers declare a shorter return period for the goods sold.  In particular, AliExpress promises 1 month for a refund for the goods sold, which also includes 14 days for possible claims or the return of defective goods. <br>  Actually, all of the above factors determine the final retail price of a real product on the virtual shelves of Internet retail. <br><br>  In many cities, including Moscow, there are souvenir retail chains that work with tourists from around the world.  This is an interesting area of ‚Äã‚Äãtrade and it was worth exploring. <br>  I decided to stop by myself in a souvenir shop in Moscow on Plyushchikha, since I passed by to work in the morning, watching buses deliver Japanese customers.  However, it quickly turned out - not a format, they do not sell any, even unpretentious electronics at this point (indeed, why should the Japanese;).  The explanation from the staff was this: - Mainly Japanese retirees from the deep provinces of Japan, who have little interest in wearable electronics and gadgets, are brought here. <br><br><h4>  Worldwide network retail </h4><br>  Among the global e-commerce channels, we identified several networks where DO-RA gadgets could be sold.  They were the three largest: Amazon, AliExpress, eBay, and also: Taobao and Tmall - working mainly for China and Rakuten - mainly for Japan.  Southeast Asia's largest online marketplace, Lazada, is the Asian Amazon, selling products mainly in the high-end segment: in Malaysia, Indonesia, Singapore, Thailand, Vietnam and the Philippines, we left for a snack. <br><br>  Amazon.com is the world's largest online retailer and one of the oldest Internet sites on Earth, headquartered in Seattle, launched in 1995.  Half of the world, and in particular: Canada, the United States, Great Britain, Germany, Brazil, Japan, India, Italy, Spain, China buy everything here - from pens to tire covers. <br><br>  To become a seller in Amazon you need: <br><br><ol><li>  Before opening an account, create a special account.  It‚Äôs worth knowing that Amazon has a cash limit for online transactions. </li><li>  Having created a personal account on the site, determine the format of who you are: Individual or Professional Seller.  The format depends on the size of the trade, branding and other features. </li><li>  You must register and your brand.  Trademark registration allows you to specify a unique key that is useful for displaying goods without using standard tools (EAN, UPC). </li><li>  For registration of the trademark will have to pay $ 275 in one category or $ 550 in two or more categories. </li><li>  You can register your trademark yourself, for this you need to fill out a special form - ‚ÄúAdministrative tribute‚Äù in English on the USPTO website, so that the application can be considered.  The cost of the operation is $ 300. </li><li>  If you have difficulties with registering a trademark in Amazon, you can hire an English-speaking assistant, which will cost an extra $ 300, or go for a more expensive option from $ 1,000 - hire an attorney for prompt registration with Amazon. </li><li>  When you register, Amazon will offer you to secure the main attribute.  This is a special number assigned to a trademark.  Can choose: <br><ul><li>  vendor code; </li><li>  numbers of style, catalog, model. </li></ul></li><li>  The main attribute of the product is automatically taken into account as original, it cannot be changed in the future, so immediately select the successful identification codes for your product. </li></ol><br>  AliExpress.com - no online store in the world is growing as fast as AliExpress.  Owns this resource Chinese corporation Alibaba Group.  It also owns the largest online platform for entrepreneurs Alibaba.com. <br><br>  The main advantage of the online store AliExpress - the seller will not be able to get your money for the goods until the goods reach you: the site has a customer protection system that guarantees a refund. <br><br>  By the way, at the end of 2015, the award ceremony for the winners and medalists of the Skolkovo Foundation and the Alibaba Group Company‚Äôs AliExpress Challenge was held in Skolkovo.  Our company "Intersoft Eurasia" won the first place in the nomination "The finished product for the promotion on the world market."  However, then there was not enough investment to launch the product into industrial production.  Let's try to use this prize now to promote the product.  Now the DO-RA gadget can be purchased from the Russian distributor online or in the above-mentioned communication shops. <br><br>  To become a seller in AliExpress you need: <br><br><ol><li>  For foreign entrepreneurs, organizing their own store on AliExpress should consider the availability of the address and phone number in China. </li><li>  To register an account, go to the website <a href="http://seller.aliexpress.com/">seller.aliexpress.com</a> .  The site works in several languages. </li><li>  Registration confirmation is given 24 hours.  After the specified time, the link will be invalid. </li><li>  Upon registration, the activation code will be sent to your phone number.  At the input code is given exactly 60 seconds, hurry, otherwise the registration will have to start all over again. </li><li>  In addition to the account on the trading platform, you must create an account in the Alipay payment system. </li><li> After confirming the registration, proceed to the next step - setting a password, specifying the last and first name, mobile phone number, address, business model: <br><br>  In the last column - the Internet experience, you must specify one of four trading platforms: <br><ul><li>  Taobao; </li><li>  eBay; </li><li>  Alibaba (China‚Äôs domestic trading platform); </li><li>  Alibaba (international marketplace). </li></ul></li><li>  The final step in creating a merchant account on AliExpress is to provide a photo of the entry stamp and visa. </li><li>  If you have completed the above registration procedure successfully, you will automatically be assigned the status of a novice seller.  At this stage you will have the opportunity to place a range of up to 50 products.  Over time, if the status of the seller will grow, the limit of the goods sold will also increase.  Verified sellers can place up to 300 positions, Gold sellers up to 5,000. </li></ol><br>  eBay.com is one of the largest trading platforms on the Internet, and it appeared in the USA, all in the same gold for 1995 online trading.  This is not just a retailer, but a place in the history of virtual trading.  Users appreciate this online store because there they can not only buy, but also sell: new or used things, antiques, electronics, and at the same time choose a direct purchase or auction. <br><br>  To become a seller in eBay you need: <br><br><ol><li>  Come up with a simple, memorable for the client login.  According to it in the future, customers will easily recognize you and your product. </li><li>  Confirm a permanently working mailbox - e-mail. </li><li>  Create your PIN via mobile phone, for ease of recovery, in case of loss. </li><li>  It is also necessary to have your PayPal account, and it is recommended to confirm the already registered PayPal account, which will save losses on the exchange rate difference between the ruble and the dollar. </li><li>  Passport is enough to verify your identity on eBay.  Enter the information in the appropriate fields and attach the scan of the first page.  The check will take a maximum of 5 days, after which the account will be considered confirmed. </li><li>  Do not forget to accept the refund program.  Without this, trading on eBay is impossible, because the site guarantees people a refund if the product was defective or did not reach them.  To do this, go back to the "Personal Information" section of the site where you created the PIN, and just below you will see the "Payment method of compensation" column.  Click Add, select PayPal as your payment method, log in to PayPal and accept the license agreement. </li><li>  Congratulations, you are now registered as a seller and can proceed to exhibiting your first product on eBay. </li></ol><br>  To be continued‚Ä¶ <br>  May 13, 2019 </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/451552/">https://habr.com/ru/post/451552/</a></p>
