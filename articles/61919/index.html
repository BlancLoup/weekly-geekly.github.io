Now it is Drupal, Joomla, Wordpress, phpBB and SMF.  Test results will be published openly. <br><br>  I invite you to take part in testing.  In exchange, participants will receive free annual hosting on VDS. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h6>  Test objectives </h6><br>  The main goal: to determine what attendance can provide given hardware configurations.  Or, in the reverse wording, how many server resources are needed to ensure a given attendance.  Additional goal: to find common application-specific bottlenecks in order to make general recommendations for tuning and optimization.

    <h6>  Testing method </h6><br>  To get a meaningful result, and not a spherical horse in a vacuum, testing should be carried out in the most realistic conditions.  This requires existing sites - with a complex structure, with content, with additional modules connected, etc.  Ideally, you need several sites of varying complexity and severity. <br><br>  A copy is made from the tested site, which is hosted on test servers of different capacities (Xen virtual machines).  This does not affect the work of the original site, it continues to work as before. <br><br>  Testing is performed by simultaneous access from several machines using the siege program, which is looped through a compiled list of requests.  The list of requests for siege is formed either from the log files of the web server of the original site, or by log obtained by recursive crawling the site using wget.  It would be great if the scripts with authorization and POST requests were implemented in testing. <br><br>  During the test, the amount of memory used, the number of processes, processor and memory consumption by processes, disk I / O are also measured. <br><br>  Test results are analyzed, new settings are made and testing continues until stable results are achieved. <br><br>  On our part, we provide the necessary hardware resources for testing, installation of the operating system, assistance in deploying test sites, setting up testing tools and assistance during the testing itself, assistance in analyzing test results, assistance in tuning the operating system and software. <br><br><h6>  Wishes to participants </h6><br>  It is imperative to have a good knowledge of the programming language and database with which the application under test is implemented, and a sufficient understanding of the application device.  Testing may require considerable time consuming from the participants, so please take a sober assessment of the possibility of your participation. <br><br><h6>  Wishes to the sites of participants </h6><br>  Sites should not violate Russian and international laws, it should not be search engine spam, pyramid schemes and other "gray" projects.  It is desirable that these were socially useful sites, but there may well be commercial sites. <br><br><h6>  Data confidentiality </h6><br>  We treat test sites as we do servers for regular paid clients.  We are a telecom operator and we guarantee confidentiality of information on standard terms, which are regulated by the Law on Communications.  If necessary, a confidentiality agreement may be in the form of a contract on paper. <br><br><h6>  Free VDS for testing participants </h6><br>  Quota for free VDS for testing participants: 30 servers for a period of 1 year.  Server features: Xen virtual machine, 480 MHz CPU, 256 Mb RAM, 8 Gb HDD.  It will be possible to provide a server and more power, but this needs to be discussed separately.  The number of participants in testing is not limited to only thirty, and if you do not need a free VDS, you can also take part in testing. <br><br><h6>  Timing </h6><br>  Testing will begin approximately June 20th.  The maximum testing period is a month, the minimum is how it will turn out.  Up to 120 VDS of various capacities will be provided for testing - from 160 MHz CPU / 64 Mb RAM / 2 Gb HDD to 2560 MHz CPU / 2048 Mb RAM / 64 Gb HDD. <br><br><h6>  Participate </h6><br>  Applications for participation in testing are accepted through the form on the website: <a href="">www.truevds.ru/contacts.form.</a> In the application, you will need to write "Testing $ appname", where $ appname is the name of the application under test, and give links to your websites on it working.  Questions and suggestions are best discussed here. <br><br>  PS If you yourself will not participate in testing, but you have friends who might be interested, please give them a link to this post. <br><br>  UPD.  Testing is not limited to these 5 applications, you can offer other options.  The main thing that it was a popular open-source product. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/61919/">https://habr.com/ru/post/61919/</a></p>
