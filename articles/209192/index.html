Disk access time, read / write speed as well as stable operation of the master server disk system is the key to quick and comfortable work for us as clients. <br><br>  I did not forget about the network and the processor, as well as shared the general impression of the server.

      Providers were chosen randomly, tested those who could quickly (within 30 minutes) get a virtual server for tests. <br>  At the end of the review, I made a summary table with short results and my subjective assessment. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Let's start: <br><br><h4>  infobox.ru </h4><br>  Microsoft Hyper-V Virtualization Technology, Intel Xeon E5645 2.4GHz Processor <br><br>  Tariff VPS 2048 - 1200r. \ Month <br><br>  DC in St. Petersburg, with a test from Moscow, ping 10ms., Without limit traffic.

Everything is pretty fast and stable. <br><br>  Positive points: <br>  ‚Ä¢ Good ping in Russia <br>  ‚Ä¢ Unlimited traffic at speeds up to 100 Mbps. <br>  ‚Ä¢ The best access time to the disk (the Access time parameter), as a result, is a fairly ‚Äúquick‚Äù server operation. <br><br>  Disadvantages: <br>  ‚Ä¢ 2 virtual cores each at 1200MHz <br><br>  Overall rating: 5- <br><br><h4>  1Gb.ru </h4><br><br>  Hyper-V Virtualization Technology, Intel Xeon E5-2660, 2.2 GHz Processor <br>  DC in Moscow, traffic is not limited.

In this case, billing issued a price list 2861r. \ Month.  As it turned out (seen from the correspondence with a company representative in the comments), the server being tested costs 1151 p. \ Month. <br><br>  During the test, there was a negative impression of the server, opening any window takes at least 3-4 seconds, and launching applications also takes a long time.  After checking the task manager found that only 800MB of RAM was allocated to the server. <br><br>  Having carefully studied the site I found a note that the allocation of RAM for the server is dynamic, which in my opinion is the reason for such a slow visual system operation. <br><br>  Disk system test: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/ca7/b4d/827/ca7b4d827186aaf7da701d87e050ca6a.jpg"><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/65c/13c/13c/65c13c13ceddf7b0db79be3902fb1cc5.jpg"><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/f97/cb0/33e/f97cb033ecbb80983e01b7af93fcc3f1.jpg"><br><br>  The recording test showed a decent write speed, however, the access time to the disk in 38ms leaves much to be desired. <br><br>  Positive points: <br>  ‚Ä¢ DC in Moscow, good ping in Moscow <br><br>  Disadvantages: <br>  ‚Ä¢ <s>Very expensive, even with the use of ssd drives.</s>  The most inconvenient control panel.  A lot of information that is submitted in an unstructured form.  (subjective opinion of the author). <br>  ‚Ä¢ Total slow system performance (most likely due to dynamic allocation of RAM) <br>  ‚Ä¢ In correspondence (in comments) with a representative of the company, some rudeness was allowed on his part. <br><br>  Overall rating: 3- <br><br><h4>  Vmco.ru </h4><br><br>  VMware vSphere virtualization technology.
