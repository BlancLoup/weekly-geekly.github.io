      Well.  Programmers have another reason to be proud of themselves.  Thanks to them, all not indifferent people now have a tool for safe and anonymous communication in case they need to defend their rights and freedoms.  In view of the <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/186460/">justified suspicions</a> and <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/186490/">recent trends</a> , the means of ensuring the privacy of personal data will undoubtedly become more popular.  The whole <a href="http://backendless.com/our-team/">international team of the company ‚ÄúBackendless‚Äù is</a> happy to assist this process. <br><br>  We present to your attention a brief interview with a developer with whom we are personally acquainted.  In the spotlight is Durga Dash - the founder of EtherGloo and its mobile app ‚Äú <a href="http://www.swarmlocal.com/">SwarmLocal</a> ‚Äù. <br><br>  (Whoever missed the example with similar functionality used on the basis of our platform, can see and download the code <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/backendless/blog/181984/">here</a> .) <br><br>  <b>Thank you for taking the time Durga.</b>  <b>So where are you?</b> <br><br>  Irving, TX <br><br>  <b>Great to be neighbors.</b>  <b>Please tell about yourself.</b>  <b>What did you do before?</b> <br><br>  I received a master‚Äôs degree from Ohio State University in Electrical Engineering.  I also had a full-time job at a software company, where I was in charge of managing the network infrastructure of their data center. <br><br>  <b>Tell us about your application that runs on the Backendless platform.</b> <br><br>  The impetus for creating a SwarmLocal ( <i>lit. ‚Äúlocal swarm (or crowd)‚Äù</i> ) was the protests of ‚ÄúOccupy Wall Street‚Äù in 2011 and then the events of the Arab Spring.  The goal was to create a service that could accumulate the power of an anonymous team in local proximity, providing it (the team) with a real-time communication tool.  Being inspired by the behavior of bees in the swarm, hence the name (‚Äúlocal or local swarm‚Äù).  In connection with this, swarms in SwarmLocal are mobile and anonymous users. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/6b6/cac/d77/6b6cacd770a3a11a2ca0c2b084aaf920.png">  The application is free and available in the <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/swarmlocal/id478347712">AppStore</a> and <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details%3Fid%3Dcom.ethergloo.swarmlocal%26feature%3Dsearch_result">Google Play</a> . <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/GMTtPGfBQ3A%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700022,15700186,15700191,15700253,15700259&amp;usg=ALkJrhiKfvF-PXhLZBIMo1r59_3p92omAw" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Muse inspiration:</b> <div class="spoiler_text">  The inspiration for creating SwarmLocal was the behavior of the "swarming" bees. <br><br>  This is how English <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swarm_behaviour">Wikipedia</a> defines swarm behavior. <br><br>  <i>‚ÄúSwarming (another meaning is‚Äú crowding ‚Äù,‚Äú lumping together / pack ‚Äù) is a collective behavior expressed by animals of similar size that come together, may be treading on one place or moving or migrating in some direction.‚Äù</i> <br><br>  Nature has always demonstrated that collective behavior or teamwork can often accelerate the movement towards success.  It is not surprising that we have a large excess of sayings that reflect this well-known fact. <br></div></div><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/d48/cc1/09c/d48cc109c4e4789198cd6ad3fcfd5b84.jpg"><br><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Together we will stand.</b>  <b class="spoiler_title">Separated, we will fall.</b>  <b class="spoiler_title">Power in the set.</b> <div class="spoiler_text">  We believe that providing the opportunity to form groups of people in a local neighborhood opens the door to a myriad of opportunities for teamwork. <br><br>  The possibilities of the application are endless.  From frivolous flash mobs to the more serious business of the revolution.  Thinking through a wide range of options, we decided to disguise the entire service in anonymity.  The person is anonymous, but together as a team, they strive for a common goal.  Also, the key feature of the ‚Äúswarm‚Äù behavior is mobility, that is, SwarmLocal allows this team to be mobile. <br><br>  SwarmLocal is our modest attempt to imitate the behavior of the ‚Äúswarm‚Äù found in nature.  Our idea is that this ability in the future be present on all types of devices and not only on smartphones.  In addition, the tool should bring people closer to the execution of specific goals and allow them to go into their personal nests as soon as the current task is completed. <br></div></div><br>  <i>Application areas: flash mob, sudden protest, discount on large quantities in the store next door, mass event, underground radio, revolution.</i> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/f07/dab/f33/f07dabf330a83da621758f282be13c15.jpg"><br><br>  The ability to form a permanent or mobile pack gives one person the power of many.  This is the only application that will allow you to become a hot spot! <br><br>  <i>Video review of the application:</i> <br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/KHD8S-gUhck&amp;xid=17259,15700022,15700186,15700191,15700253,15700259&amp;usg=ALkJrhjE6fLebQKZoQnV8uwhuaN5G_KdJw" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  <b>Cool idea.</b>  <b>How long do you develop applications?</b>  <b>Is this your first application?</b> <br><br>  I have been developing applications for about 5 years.  My first apps were Windows Mobile.  Contraction Timer and BugPhone. <br><br>  <b>What was the most difficult in the development process?</b> <br><br>  One of the biggest challenges in the development was the need to provide audio and video broadcast from mobile devices in real time and solve the issue with the backend that could provide this functionality and scale.  There are not so many solutions for this issue on the market at the moment. <br><br>  <b>Please take us through the process of making decisions and backend options for your application.</b> <br><br>  Regarding the ability to support broadcasting of audio and video in real time, there are not so many services on the market.  Especially those that integrate the native code of various end-user devices. <br><br>  <b>How did you find our solution?</b> <br><br>  I was at a meeting of mobile developers in Dallas and one of the speakers was Mark Piller.  (CEO, Backendless).  He presented the concept and solution of backend-as-service.  At that time, I was looking for a solution that would remove the hard questions about the server side and allowed me to focus on front-end.  Thus, Backendless turned out to be the perfect choice for my requirements. <br><br>  <b>How is the platform's functionality used in your application?</b> <br><br>  At the moment we are using API media services for broadcasting audio and video from iOS devices. <br><br>  <b>What do you like most about backend as a Backendless service?</b> <br><br>  ‚Ä¢ Simple and elegant admin panel; <br>  ‚Ä¢ Well documented APIs and examples; <br>  ‚Ä¢ I had to cross with the support department and even request additional features that were added pretty quickly; <br>  ‚Ä¢ In the end, the platform is very easy to use.  And I like to use tools that really simplify the execution of complex things behind the scenes. <br><br>  <b>What features do you expect Backendless to cover for you in the future?</b> <br><br>  In my opinion, the API of media services should be made available for other platforms, not just iOS.  I would also like to see the ability to manage live streams and add / insert custom content from the admin console. <br><br>  <b>What are your future plans for SwarmLocal?</b> <br><br>  ‚Ä¢ Provide live broadcast on all mobile platforms. <br>  ‚Ä¢ Provide users with the ability to encrypt their messages. <br>  ‚Ä¢ Port to other platforms except iOS and Android. <br><br>  <b>How do you spend your leisure time?</b>  <b>Have a favorite hobby?</b> <br><br>  I have a three-year-old daughter who is just an incredible time absorber.  In addition to working on SwarmLocal, a new passion has appeared - boxing. <br><br>  <b>Wow, impressive!</b>  <b>Do you have recommendations for those who develop their first applications?</b> <br><br>  I have a blog that can help other indie developers on their way to create the first application.  You can <a href="http://www.swarmlocal.com/resources-for-the-indie-developer/">read here</a> . <br><br>  <b>Be sure to read.</b>  <b>Our best wishes, Durga.</b>  <b>Thank you for sharing your thoughts with us.</b> <br><br>  (PS If your application is running on our platform, please drop a line of text to community@backendless.com. We will be happy to tell the whole world about you :)) <br><br>  <b>Code:</b> <br>  The phrase Bruce Willis ‚ÄúPublic opinion is the opinion of those who are not asked.‚Äù Can be added to the constitution of the majority of post-Soviet countries with the last line.  Moreover, in the fairy-tale lands of Fedorovich, Lukomora, Beliberda Mukhoedov and Vladimir, where the chance of free political competition was never given, and the laws are applied very selectively, ordinary citizens in protecting their rights except for themselves and their friends do not count on anyone.  Ernesto, having no means of communication and only 82 people in the team (relying on something - complete madness), was able to change the fate of the whole country.  I wonder what we are capable of, owning all the knowledge of the world and technologies of the 21st century?  We hope that you will have thoughts on how to localize or make a similar service for your area.  And yes, we remind you that when creating an application, it is not necessary to <s>reinvent lisapet</s> writing your backend, you can use <a href="http://backendless.com/">ready-made</a> . <br><br>  Viva Zapata! <br><br>  PS Most likely, most of the readers (as well as the author of these lines) spent their childhood in the USSR.  In this connection, a survey on the percentage of homo soveticus in the blood will be relevant.  The virus is expressed in the behavior of "us * boot, and we grow stronger.".  It is diagnosed by the impossibility of detachment of the lower massif from the chair for the sake of any action related to public interests and civil rights.  After choosing the answer, it is recommended to look in the mirror and only then vote.  Yes, this situation in which we ourselves do not know for sure what we will do, but we can try.  So. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/186586/">https://habr.com/ru/post/186586/</a></p>
