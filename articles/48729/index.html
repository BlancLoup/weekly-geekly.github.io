I decided to lower the bar a little and put up 2 points for supporting the DB.  Then you need to recalculate the results :). <br>  So: <br>  NClass - 16 points (nothing has changed). <br>  MS Visio Professional 2007 - 61 points (slightly lost). <br>  Altova UModel 2008 - 57 points. <br><br>  The combined result for <s>all the</s> tools for Windows OS (there will be a series of habrotopic for Linux) as well as price tags and URLs for the available versions will be in the final topic.

      I also recall the parameters by which I make a comparison: <br>  1. UML support.  (Score from 0 to 10) <br>  2. Verifying UML diagrams.  (Score from 0 to 10) <br>  3. Generation of source codes by UML diagram.  (Score from 0 to 10) <br>  4. Reverse engineering of source codes.  (Score from 0 to 10) <br>  5. Supporting development processes (I don‚Äôt understand much, but I need to develop myself).  (Score from 0 to 10) <br>  6. Designing the database.  (Score from 0 to 10) <br>  7. Supported databases, by default.  (For each database by 0 to 5 points) <br>  8. Validate the database. (Score from 0 to 10) <br>  9. Reverse engineering database. (Score from 0 to 10) <br>  10. Ease of use (so I liked it.) (Rated from 0 to 10). <br><br><h4>  And what do you have such an interesting dangle? </h4><br><h6>  Magic draw </h6><br>  Version 16 for 2008.  I loaded for quite some time. <br>  Well, the fairly good list of charts is impressive. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/420/2c2/807/4202c2807ac00347bae5c00e7978dc55.png"><br>  Let's take a closer look ... <br>  The interface could and improve.  In my opinion, rather small icons.  But the whole interface is pretty nice. <br><br>  The diagrams worked out pretty well too.  There is a healthy such dynamism, in the sense that by creating one class you can dance from it without going every time to the panel for creating elements. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/d45/773/cde/d45773cde002ecd00a79d0339cafa938.png"><br><br>  But the diagram suffers from a lack of information.  I would like, for example, if I created a connection, then a member of the class / element / etc was automatically substituted. <br><br>  But move on to the dry statistics. <br>  1. UML - fully supported.  (ten). <br>  2. There is a check for correctness, but some kind of suspicious, it did not work out for me to form a clumsy model ... (9). <br>  3. According to the stated data, he owns such languages ‚Äã‚Äãas Java, C ++, CORBA IDL, DDL, EJB, CIL, C #.  Looked only for C #, I was completely satisfied with the generated code (10). <br>  4. Can reverse, even have to understand Java ByteCody and CIL Disasm (all the above languages ‚Äã‚Äãare also supported).  Able to communicate with NetBeans, JBuilder, Eclipse, Sun One Studio, IntelliJ IDEA (10). <br>  5. There are business processes, but not all, but one (7). <br>  6. Able to work with the database, but the default Oracle (9). <br>  7. As far as I could figure out - only Oracle (2). <br>  8. Is able to check (9). <br>  9. Reverse DB - manages (9). <br>  10. But the badness is bad, if the interface is still normal, then the help is something.  ‚ÄúYou need to know this?  Then stomp on the site and download mana! ‚Äù, This approach strains me, because you can also make a normal help, and not to go to the Internet for more or less necessary information (8). <br><br>  Total: 83 points, <s>spat</s> . <br><br><h4>  Fearing counter-intelligence, avoiding secular life, under the English pseudonym ... </h4><br><h6>  Sparx Enterprise Architect </h6><br><br>  Some habroles in habrunnage are also known as Enterprise Architect, EA (not to be confused with games) <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/335/89a/e3c/33589ae3cb26ffd621aa47af77f0a06c.png"><br><br>  Pretty nice on the appearance, moreover, when you first start offers to read spralochku.  I put version 7.1. <br>  The choice offered to them is not wide, but not small.  I would say what you need. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/33d/9f6/69e/33d9f669efc1e7c968e81102102c5e93.png"><br><br>  The charts are pretty pleasing in appearance. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/0c8/d16/d74/0c8d16d740cd4c570939818cabc8cfa0.png"><br><br>  Able to check the words for correctness, about checking the correctness of the diagrams silently silent.  But he can draw user interfaces.  I am also very annoying, when you create a new element, the editing window for its properties crashes.  Once 2 years ago it was precisely because of this that he refused, although I liked it. <br>  Able to work with languages ‚Äã‚Äãsuch as C, C ++, C #, ActionScript, Delphi, Java, PHP, Python, Visual Basic, VB.Net.  It is also intended for the work of the team (repositories, common databases etc). <br>  I formed the opinion that this product is designed for medium-sized businesses, rather unassuming, but there is a necessary minimum, and moreover, it is very well made.  Ehh ... it remains to wait for minor improvements. <br><br>  1. UML is supported in full size (10). <br>  2. I did not find checks for correctness, maybe I was mistaken, I will be glad if they point it out to me, but so far (2) (2 because there is an opportunity to ‚Äúdance‚Äù from some element, but there is no specific check). <br>  3. Generates codes quite successfully (10). <br>  4. And reverse successfully (10). <br>  5. Processes are (10). <br>  6. DB can design (10). <br>  7. It maintains a fairly solid database list, namely: DB2, Informix, Ingres, InterBase, MS Access, MySQL, Oracle, Postgre SQL, SQL Server 2000, SQL Server 2005, SQLServer7, Sybase, Sybase ACE.  Solid in the gap went (26). <br>  8. Can check the database for correctness, but I would be careful (9). <br>  9. Reverse DB can (10). <br>  10. Quite comfortable, although I prefer a <s>less rigorous</s> more rigorous design.  This is what really hurt me - after adding an element to the diagram, the window for editing the properties of an object appears.  And I was asked?  Or maybe I don't want to ?!  (If anyone knows, tell me how to turn it off, I will be very grateful :)).  It is for this window that he gets ‚Äúone cap‚Äù (8). <br><br>  Total - 99 points.  In my opinion honestly deserved. <br><br><h4>  This fantastic lego </h4><br><h6>  Visual paradigm </h6><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/f21/ce8/f91/f21ce8f913e84fe1ac14f541a6c4dd35.png"><br>  VP Suite 3.4. <br>  The choice offered by this product is quite wide. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/a65/9b4/51e/a659b451ebacf1a2a05c6d83e7481388.png"><br>  I used it for about 6-7 months, so I had quite pleasant feelings about it, although I also had negative feelings.  But about this in a row. <br>  I was pleased that the product is very well developed and meets the standards. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/a41/2da/256/a412da256cbd94476d6a1cdffd53a5fe.png"><br>  Moreover, on the manufacturer's website, you can find a bunch of examples, which is also very important.  It is also a convenient interface and a good help, but you have to download help from the Internet, which is a minus. <br>  By itself, a constructor represents, many, many elements assembled into one shell.  You can install certain components, which will affect the license accordingly. <br>  Provides very good integration with development tools such as Visual Studio, Eclipse, Borland JBuilder, NetBeans / Sun ONE, IntelliJ IDEA, Oracle JDeveloper, BEA WebLogic Workshop.  Pretty good list, isn't it? <br>  What pleased me in this version is that they got rid of the bug with the copy / paste element.  They turned out a good product. <br>  It is also an important factor, something that supports code generation and can reverse, though the language lists differ slightly.  Able to generate code for: Java, C ++, CORBA IDL, PHP, XML Schema, Ada, Python, C #, VB .NET, Object Definition Language (ODL), Flash ActionScript, Delphi, Perl, Objective-C, and Ruby. <br>  Can reverse: Java, C ++, CORBA IDL, PHP, XML Schema, Ada, Python, C #, Java class, .NET dll and exe, JDBC. <br>  Maybe someone will correct me, but at least this data is given on the developer‚Äôs website. <br>  The part responsible for working with the database is also very well developed, and the list of supported databases is impressive.  Moreover, you can deliver your providers and work with the "left" database.  In the standard installation I received: MySQL, MS SQL Server, Oracle, HSQL, Sybase ASE, Sybase SQL Anywhere, PostgreSQL, CloudScape / Derby, DB2, Ingres, OpenEdge, Informix, Firebird, FrontBase, Cache, SQLite.  Yes, the team are great, for the time of use the list has grown. <br>  I think it is worthwhile to cite the figures, for I can continue to praise this product for a long time, despite the fact that I am not working with it now. <br>  Results: <br>  1. UML support - 10. <br>  2. Can check for correctness - 10. <br>  3. Source codes for UML are also generated quite successfully (tested for C #) - 10. <br>  4. Reverse Engineering Successful - 10. <br>  5. Business processes - a separate ‚Äúpackage‚Äù, but they are - 10. <br>  6. DB designs - 10. <br>  7. The list of supported databases is given above - 32. <br>  8. Verification of correctness is - 10. <br>  9. Can reverse the database (tested on PostgreSQL) - 10. <br>  10. Very convenient in terms of usability, perhaps again "peresyuda" on it - 10. <br>  Total: 122 points (at the II stage undoubted leader). <br><br>  To be continued.  The next habrotopic is the ‚Äúbattle‚Äù of the heavyweights. <br><br>  UPD.  The comments began to skip the comments that I did not consider Rational.  If refer to the <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/development/46648/">previous topic</a> .  Then you will be able to see a list there, of what will be considered necessarily, namely: <br>  1. NClass <br>  2. MS Visio Professional 2007. <br>  3. Altova UModel 2008. <br>  4. Magic Draw. <br>  5. Sparx Enterprise Architect. <br>  6. Visual Paradigm. <br>  7. Sybase Power Designer <br>  8. Rational (family). <br><br>  UPD2.
