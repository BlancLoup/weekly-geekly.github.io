  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Six questions for FrontFest speakers</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"> <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/company/2gis/blog/340986/"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/lw/yu/gu/lwyugu-mnkz1mqlprn15r4u3jcs.jpeg"></a> <br><br>  A couple of years ago at CodeFest we came up with an expert zone.  Well, they came up with it - they probably peeped at a foreign conference, but they already forgot about which one.  So, the expert zone is the place where the speaker goes after his report and at least one more slot (report time + questions) communicates with the participants.  Why did we do that?  To increase the time of communication of participants with the speaker.  No wonder that it is easier to ask questions on the sidelines than from the audience. <br><br>  At <a href="https://2017.frontfest.ru/%3Futm_source%3Dhabr%26utm_medium%3Dnews%26utm_campaign%3Dinterview_1">FrontFest,</a> we went further and decided to ‚Äúwarm up‚Äù the speakers in advance - we came up with six questions about technology, the future of the web, work and hobbies.  Meet, ask your questions in the comments, come to chat in person at FrontFest! <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h2>  1. What technology has surprised you lately? </h2><br>  <b>Victor <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/users/gritzko/" class="user_link">gritzko</a> Grischenko</b> <br>  ADS-B protocol.  If you looked at the aircraft <a href="https://www.flightradar24.com/">Flightradar</a> , then perhaps you have a question, where the data come from.  The data comes from airplanes using the ADS-B protocol.  There, the message size is 120 BIT, and all data, globally unique id-names and a rather large CRC are placed in it.  After that, of course, it is difficult to look at sites where five megabytes of JavaScript draw a couple of buttons.

      <b>Igor <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/users/iamo0/" class="user_link">iamo0</a> Alekseenko</b> <br>  Prolog.  I stumbled upon it as part of a raid on other languages ‚Äã‚Äãthat I occasionally spend.  I really like to learn from the experience of programmers in other languages, it broadens the mind and helps to solve problems more effectively. <br><br>  Prolog struck me that it uses an approach that is completely opposite to the one we are used to in programming.  Usually, to solve a problem, the programmer must describe how to solve this problem in detail, so that the computer gives the final answer, but it is difficult, we can miss a lot, it is difficult for the human brain to control such large data streams.  That is why there are testing, complex IDE and other tools that help the programmer to better understand what is happening in his own program. <br><br>  The prologue is completely different.  This is a declarative programming language.  In it, the programmer operates with facts and assertions.  Simply put, describes the source data and the relationship between them, and then the language itself finds the solution to some problem.  For example, in the prologue, you can describe the concept of "Parallel lines" and referring to this concept to solve different problems: you can find out whether one line is parallel to another, and you can learn how to get a line parallel to a given one.  These are two completely different tasks, but Prolog himself finds solutions on them, relying on the initial data, the programmer can only ask the right question. <br><br>  <b>Vladimir Dashukevich</b> <br>  Quantum computer!  I have always liked the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãquantum uncertainty and the fact that this uncertainty can be used to perform certain calculations.  I think an experimenter lives in each of us who wants to learn more and more new technologies and new programming languages.  And so, relatively recently, I learned that you can try your programs on a real quantum computer from IBM, and also about a special programming language for it.  And now this technology takes 50% of my free time. <br><br>  <b>Sergey <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/users/popovsergey/" class="user_link">popovsergey</a> Popov</b> <br>  CSS Grid Layout.  Surprised everyone.  It changes the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãwhat the grid and how they are built.  Open the road to new interfaces.  But even if we ignore this, I am very surprised at how quickly this specification, in its new format, was assembled and implemented in browsers.  This is probably the benchmark for how the specification should evolve. <br><br>  <b>Anton Nemtsev</b> <br>  CSS property contain.  The ability to manage CSS rendering is a rarity. <br><br>  <b>Aleksey <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/users/iadramelk/" class="user_link">iadramelk</a> Ivanov</b> <br>  It is hard to say.  Everything has either not recently appeared, or so far only in specifications. Of the interesting things in recent months, I can remember the Chrome Observers: MutationObserver, PerformanceObserver, IntersectionObserver, that's all.  Simple at first glance, the idea, but it is very much lacking. <br><br><h2>  2. What is the future of the web? </h2><br>  <b>Vladislav <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/users/5angel/" class="user_link">5angel Kozulya</a></b> <br>  There will be no web.  The web and the desktop will merge in ecstasy. <br><br>  <b>Vladimir Dashukevich</b> <br>  The future is in new data transfer protocols, as the current state of affairs is very bad.  Today, we, as web developers, need to provide quick access to the necessary data, the integrity and relevance of the data, as well as their encryption and authentication.  And over time, web applications will become even more difficult and require even more.  Therefore, we need to think about changing and / or improving modern protocols. <br><br>  <b>Victor Grishchenko</b> <br>  Perhaps the future of the web is not behind the web?  Forecasts, especially about the web - a thankless task.  Sooner or later, all of us will be replaced by robots. <br><br>  <b>Aleksey Ivanov</b> <br>  The most interesting thing I am waiting for and what I hope for is Houdini.  It will finally make the low-level CSS APIs available.  This means polyfiles for CSS, their properties for CSS, control of drawing and redrawing and much more. <br><br>  <b>Ilya <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/users/ilfa/" class="user_link">ilfa</a> Taratukhin</b> <br>  For applications that adapt to the platform on the fly and work correctly when communication is lost.  Now just a lot of tools for this appear, I hope a new standard will be born on this.  In general, we already have Service Workers and GraphQL, as a good start. <br><br>  <b>Anton Eprev</b> <br>  The web in fact does not change - we still type hypertext and use the URL.  Therefore, the future of the web in its present. <br><br><h2>  3. Who needs to be monitored on the web now to be in trend? </h2><br>  <b>Aleksey Ivanov</b> <br>  The main source of trends and links over the past couple of years has been a working one for me, but it‚Äôs difficult to subscribe to people from :) From the not entirely obvious Twitter subscriptions, I would recommend the creator of the webpack <a href="https://twitter.com/wSokra">@wSokra</a> and the creator of cycle.js <a href="https://twitter.com/andrestaltz">@andrestaltz</a> . <br><br>  <b>Ilya Taratukhin</b> <br>  I was lucky and my former and current colleagues are doing it for me, I just have to follow the links from the chat and watch retweets.  He himself subscribes to Sitnik, <a href="http://spb-frontend.ru/">SPB Frontend</a> , Brian Eich and everything seems to be.  As an entertainment (and to cry from impotence) you can subscribe to Kozul. <br><br>  <b>Vladislav Kozulya</b> <br>  Kozul, of course.  What a strange question? <br><br>  <b>Vladimir Dashukevich</b> <br>  Definitely, browser developers and browser engines (Lin Clark), their official accounts (like <a href="https://twitter.com/v8js">V8</a> , <a href="https://twitter.com/ChakraCore">ChakraCore</a> ), official accounts of large firms (IBM, Miscrosoft, Google), popularizers of web technologies (Grigory Petrov, Troy Hunt, bobuk, Val Head) and etc. <br><br>  <b>Anton Nemtsev</b> <br><br><ul><li>  <a href="https://github.com/tc39">github.com/tc39</a> , in particular <a href="https://github.com/tc39/ecma262">github.com/tc39/ecma262</a> </li><li>  <a href="https://github.com/w3c">github.com/w3c</a> , in particular <a href="https://github.com/w3c/csswg-drafts">github.com/w3c/csswg-drafts</a> </li><li>  <a href="https://www.smashingmagazine.com/">www.smashingmagazine.com</a> </li><li>  <a href="https://alistapart.com/">alistapart.com</a> </li><li>  <a href="http://lea.verou.me/">lea.verou.me</a> </li><li>  <a href="https://ireaderinokun.com/">ireaderinokun.com</a> </li><li>  <a href="https://css-tricks.com/">css-tricks.com</a> </li><li>  <a href="https://ponyfoo.com/">ponyfoo.com</a> </li></ul><br>  ... <br>  or rather just subscribe to the weekly newsletters on HTML, CSS and JS.  There are many of them. <br><br><h2>  4. What hinders / helps you keep the deadlines for completing tasks? </h2><br>  <b>Victor Grishchenko</b> <br>  Coffee is both.  On the one hand, it allows you to mobilize.  On the other hand, under caffeine, you start something wrong and invent something and do extra work.  Drink coffee - do stupid things faster, with more energy! <br><br>  <b>Igor Alekseenko</b> <br>  Interfere with the desire to try something new.  Curiosity.  Instead of doing it reliably, tested and boring, there is a desire to try something new, to solve the problem in some other way.  On the other hand, it helps to some extent.  But most of all helps the proximity of the deadline :) <br><br>  <b>Vladimir <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/users/tadatuta/" class="user_link">tadatuta</a> Grinenko</b> <br>  Hardest of all prevents the ability to open multiple tabs in the browser and editor.  Still prevent telegrams, Skype, jabber and mail.  However, the mail just hangs in a separate tab in the browser.  And the darkness outside the window and the fact that winter is near helps. <br><br>  <b>Anton Nemtsev</b> <br>  Their accurate statement and tracking of performance of tasks by means of thought cards and a calendar helps.  Distractions, changes in the task scope, problems with estimating the time it takes to perform certain types of tasks interfere. <br><br>  <b>Aleksey Ivanov</b> <br>  Guilt! <br><br><h2>  5. If not programming, then what and why? </h2><br>  <b>Vladislav Kozulya</b> <br>  Recruiting  I love to connect hearts. <br><br>  <b>Anton Eprev</b> <br>  The photo.  I love pictures that I want to return to. <br><br>  <b>Anton Nemtsev</b> <br>  Stripper in a gay club.  And why not?  Or maybe a little horse.  I like animals! <br><br>  <b>Victor Grishchenko</b> <br>  I have different hobbies - cooking, making leather notebooks and all sorts of <br>  such things.  But to turn it into work is difficult - the economy does not converge.  To converge, you need to sell cheap mass Chinese products, but at the same time, to take, as for the elite and exclusive.  That is, you need a brand, marketing and brainwashing to the public.  In the world of notebooks, this is Moleskine implemented, for example. <br><br>  Similar to the kitchen.  I can not imagine where you can eat a good solyanka - this soup is too expensive for catering.  A small savings on ingredients and / or process immediately improves financial performance so that you can look for a good hodgepodge only in Michelin restaurants.  However, these principles also apply to the world of technology. <br><br>  <b>Igor Alekseenko</b> <br>  I have already chosen - teaching. <br><br>  I still program, but this is not my main profession, now it is a skill that helps me solve problems.  In general, I believe that programming, sooner or later, from the main profession will turn into an auxiliary skill.  Now programmers are people who know how to solve someone else's problem with their tools and, in fact, receive money for knowing magic spells that others do not know.  It seems that one day this will change. <br><br>  <b>Vladimir Grinenko</b> <br>  In fact, many aspects of our life are programming in one form or another. <br>  After all, programming is when you take a big incomprehensible task, bite off a small piece of it that puts it in your head, and you figure out what steps you need to go through in order to get closer to a common goal. <br><br>  For example, I want to become a good person.  What this means is not clear.  But you can estimate that one of the components will be, say, a good education.  How to get a good education is also unclear.  But just need to learn to read.  And with this task, everything is already simple: <br><br> <code>studyAlphabet() <br> .then(getSomeBooks) <br> .then(books =&gt; Promise.all(books.map(readBook))); <br></code> <br><br><h2>  6. Which report from FrontFest will you go to and why? </h2><br>  <b>Ilya Taratukhin</b> <br>  I would go to <a href="https://2017.frontfest.ru/lecture/6/%3Futm_source%3Dhabr%26utm_medium%3Dnews%26utm_campaign%3Dinterview_1">Vladimir Grinenko</a> , he always has interesting reports, and here a hot topic is planned.  <a href="https://2017.frontfest.ru/lecture/12/%3Futm_source%3Dhabr%26utm_medium%3Dnews%26utm_campaign%3Dinterview_1">Tim Chaptykov has</a> extensive experience with graphics, there is something to learn.  It is curious that <a href="https://2017.frontfest.ru/lecture/9/%3Futm_source%3Dhabr%26utm_medium%3Dnews%26utm_campaign%3Dinterview_1">Vladimir Dashukevich</a> will tell, for us the complexity of algorithms and optimization of data storage on the client is now a very relevant topic. <br><br>  <b>Vladimir Dashukevich</b> <br>  <a href="https://2017.frontfest.ru/lecture/21/%3Futm_source%3Dhabr%26utm_medium%3Dnews%26utm_campaign%3Dinterview_1">I'll shut up your javascript</a> .  The functional approach to writing programs is very appealing to me (it is as beautiful as math) and the experience of other people in this field is extremely interesting to me.  How they organize the code, how they build the architecture of the application in a functional style, how they overcome certain difficulties. <br><br>  <b>Igor Alekseenko</b> <br>  I can not name one, so I will list a few: <br><br><ul><li>  Leoni Watson's <a href="https://2017.frontfest.ru/lecture/1/%3Futm_source%3Dhabr%26utm_medium%3Dnews%26utm_campaign%3Dinterview_1">accessibility talk</a> is one of the fundamental things on the web that receives very little attention. </li><li>  It is interesting to know what <a href="https://2017.frontfest.ru/lecture/22/%3Futm_source%3Dhabr%26utm_medium%3Dnews%26utm_campaign%3Dinterview_1">kind of RON format</a> , about which Viktor Grishchenko will talk about, it seems that I have problems in solving which this format can help. </li><li>  It would be very curious to go to a <a href="https://2017.frontfest.ru/lecture/15/%3Futm_source%3Dhabr%26utm_medium%3Dnews%26utm_campaign%3Dinterview_1">Code &amp; Art</a> performance, because it is always interesting to look at unusual ways of using programming. </li><li>  For the same reason, I would like to hear the report of Lisa Gardner <a href="https://2017.frontfest.ru/lecture/24/%3Futm_source%3Dhabr%26utm_medium%3Dnews%26utm_campaign%3Dinterview_1">JavaScript on Things</a> . </li><li>  And at the end, I will note the report of Vladimir Dashukevich about <a href="https://2017.frontfest.ru/lecture/9/%3Futm_source%3Dhabr%26utm_medium%3Dnews%26utm_campaign%3Dinterview_1">algorithms and data structures</a> , because this topic is still far away and incomprehensible for many web developers, but it is in vain. </li></ul><br>  <b>Sergey Popov</b> <br>  <a href="https://2017.frontfest.ru/lecture/5/%3Futm_source%3Dhabr%26utm_medium%3Dnews%26utm_campaign%3Dinterview_1">How does the chief editor</a> , because I often use it.  <a href="https://2017.frontfest.ru/lecture/11/%3Futm_source%3Dhabr%26utm_medium%3Dnews%26utm_campaign%3Dinterview_1">Codestyle and violence</a> , because the name has. <br><br>  <b>Anton Nemtsev</b> <br>  Hard to say.  The conference had a great program.  I would definitely like to hear: <br><br>  ‚Äú <a href="https://2017.frontfest.ru/lecture/13/%3Futm_source%3Dhabr%26utm_medium%3Dnews%26utm_campaign%3Dinterview_1">React and data: Effective ways of storing and changing state</a> ‚Äù - recently I have been working with a reactor and this is a topic of current importance for me; <br><br>  ‚Äú <a href="https://2017.frontfest.ru/lecture/10/%3Futm_source%3Dhabr%26utm_medium%3Dnews%26utm_campaign%3Dinterview_1">Progressive Image Rendering</a> ‚Äù - because pictures are a significant part of the content and it is always better to serve it in the best possible way; <br><br>  And of course ‚Äú <a href="https://2017.frontfest.ru/lecture/32/%3Futm_source%3Dhabr%26utm_medium%3Dnews%26utm_campaign%3Dinterview_1">Trends and frontends</a> ‚Äù because there is always something that you are unaware of and in vain, and because of Victor Grischenko.  Victor is a very powerful argument, you know. <br><br>  <b>Victor Grishchenko</b> <br>  This is always a difficult question.  I will listen to everything related to the SPA. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/59/e7/ea/59e7eaeeef1f7643923315.jpeg"><br>  Warmed up?
