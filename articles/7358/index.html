In this habratopic I decided to tell you everything about her. <br>  Read, sir !!!  I hope it will be interesting ... <br><img src="http://2007.rif.ru/img/partners/webmoney-logo.gif" hspace="10" vspace="10"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  But if you expect that now I‚Äôll take and tell you everything about WebMoney, don‚Äôt hope.  Because the ‚ÄúWebMoney payment system‚Äù is such a thing that seems to exist, but at the same time it seems to be like that as well.  Going to the site webmoney.ru and trying to read the user agreement, we will scratch the back of the head, as we stumble on eight agreements at once.  As we begin to understand, we will understand the chain and soon realize that we need to examine several more agreements, then a few more, then the number of agreements will increase to dozens ... And we will understand that isolating from all this clutter what is actually WebMoney system is quite problematic . <br><br>  Everything is divided into functions, sites, services for which different legal entities are responsible.  There is a transport environment in which electronic currencies circulate.  There are currencies themselves, but each of them is completely unlike the others, and a separate legal entity is responsible for each currency, whether it is affiliated or third-party ‚Äî you will not understand.  And then there are the so-called ‚Äúservices‚Äù that are so embedded in the environment that without them its operation is problematic.  I knowingly used the word "environment". <br><br>  Payment system WebMoney does not exist at all, gentlemen.  There is a certain business environment within which electronic currencies issued by participants of this medium can circulate.  But it must be understood that the flies are separate, and the cutlets are separate.  Both electronic currencies and the means by which they are converted are different, and to some extent independent components and it is better to analyze them separately.

      <br>
      If you do not give yourself the trouble to understand this simple fact, you can get into a piquant position.  I sometimes come across very serious legal articles where the authors are seriously trying to analyze what legal status an electronic currency has under the name ‚Äútitle signs‚Äù mentioned in the agreement of the WebMoney Transfer payment system.  They do not even suspect that this agreement is not about electronic money, but about the transport system in which this electronic money is circulated.  In other words, about those "trucks" that carry "electronic money" between users.  And ‚ÄúTitle units‚Äù are not ‚Äúelectronic money‚Äù themselves, but units of measurement of their quantity. <br><br>  You can try to analyze how well these trucks are armored, how well their guards are trained, how they follow traffic rules.  But it‚Äôs foolish to analyze the legal status of ‚Äúpieces‚Äù, or ‚Äúthousands of pieces‚Äù, in which the contents of these trucks are measured. <br><br>  However, the analysis of the transport system is also a necessary thing, and someday I will definitely take care of it, but now I will start with the contents of these very "trucks". <br><br>  So, the "basic" to date electronic units that apply to the "transport" system "WebMoney Transfer" - "dollar" WMZ.  Well, here we also add the ‚Äúeuro‚Äù WME, since this is the same - only the denomination is different. <br><br>  In order to give these units a legal status that would depend little on the local legislations of different countries where these units apply, WebMoney has resorted to, let's say, a very unconventional solution. <br><br>  And in order to understand its essence - let's transfer ... to Japan. <br><br>  Japan is an amazing country.  There are many things that Europeans or Americans cannot understand, but the Russian people understand quickly and immediately.  For example, how the Japanese solve their problems with gambling. <br><br>  The Japanese, as you know, people are very gambling.  If gambling were allowed in Japan, the whole country would have been lost long ago.  Therefore, the Japanese government understands that if it does not ban gambling, citizens will not understand it.  And at the same time, the government is well aware of the other thing - if it prohibits gambling, the citizens will not understand it either, and they will still play.  Therefore, the task is as follows: it is necessary to prohibit gambling, but at the same time give the opportunity to those citizens who are ripe enough to ‚Äúconscious‚Äù gambling, to realize their desire without breaking the law. <br><br>  Therefore, gambling in Japan is absolutely prohibited.  But the law, forbidding gambling, cannot forbid "to play at all."  No one can forbid you to play a non-gambling game and, as a prize, get, let's say, a teddy bear.  At the same time, of course, there can be no law that would establish the maximum value of teddy bears. <br><br>  Do you already understand where I'm going? <br><br>  As soon as you win a teddy bear, a man who exclaims in Japanese will surely appear next to you: ‚ÄúWell, wow!  I just really need just such a teddy bear!  I need it so badly that I am ready to pay you a million yen in cash for it from this place! ‚Äù <br><br>  So, when I read the user agreement for the sale of goods and services using ‚Äúgift WMZ certificates‚Äù, for some reason, I see ‚Äúteddy bears‚Äù all the time. <br><br>  So, setting the problem.  WMZ and WME are ‚Äúcurrency‚Äù units.  They are, in fact, intended for international exchange in the framework of Webmoney Transfer.  And all would be nothing, but bad luck, the governments of some countries look askance at the desire of their citizens to pay in ‚Äúforeign‚Äù currencies.  And in some countries they look so slanted that they even prohibit nominating order securities in ‚Äúforeign‚Äù monetary units. <br><br>  But at the same time, pay attention, no government can prohibit any store to ‚Äúencourage‚Äù its regular customers by issuing ‚Äúgift certificates‚Äù for them, which will enable them to buy goods at this store on any special conditions.  It was allowed even in Soviet times. <br><br>  And since such ‚Äúcertificates‚Äù are intended to receive goods exclusively in this store, and therefore are neither money nor order securities, then no one can ban the store, in order to protect against inflation, to nominate these gift certificates in foreign conventional units. <br><br>  And of course, if several stores agree among themselves on the issue of uniform, common to all "gift certificates" that no one can prohibit them from doing so.  If, at the same time, the stores decide not to bother themselves on the issue and entrust it to some third-party company - nothing illegal in this will happen.  And if, in order not to argue among themselves, according to which legislation to issue this whole thing and reduce the risks of dependence on the laws of their countries, the shops will take the wise decision to entrust the whole company to a company from Panama and judge and dispose according to Panamanian law - no one has the right to to ban. <br><br>  Well, let alone such trifles as to issue certificates in a non-cash form and entrust the Webmoney Transfer system with their turnover - I am not talking about that.  They have a right! <br><br>  If you imagine, everything that I just talked about, implemented in practice, this is what WMZ and WME will be. <br><br>  The scheme is legally unshakable, unsinkable and little dependent on the ‚Äúlocal‚Äù laws of the participating countries.  But at the same time it has several "misunderstandings". <br><br>  And neponyatki - such. <br><br>  If you bought a gift certificate, you should understand that ‚Äúyou can spend it only in stores that are part of the‚Äú community ‚Äùthat issued these certificates.  I quote - ‚ÄúThe Buyer acknowledges that he acquired the WMZ Certificate in order to receive the goods and services of the Suppliers registered in the <a href="http://www.wmgate.ru/">www.wmgate.ru</a> service.  The certificate can not be returned, can be used exclusively for the exchange of goods and services provided in the service wmgate.ru. ‚Äú <br><br>  If you do not understand the gentlemen, what is at stake, I will explain.  Nobody is obliged to accept this ‚Äúgift certificate‚Äù from you except the stores from the ‚ÄúMegastock‚Äù service.  Nobody is obliged to change you back for money.  This clause makes WMZ-WME's legal status unbreakable, it reduces all the treatment of these units to a private agreement between the seller and the buyer, which is little subject to local regulatory laws - as agreed, the way it is. <br><br>  But it also severely limits the turnover of WMZ-WME, giving rise to the chain of the very "misunderstandings" that I have already mentioned above.  Agree, it is not quite clear how an e-currency, burdened with such ‚Äúnot obliged‚Äù, suddenly has such huge momentum. <br><br>  And you just think about teddy bears, and you will immediately understand everything. <br><br>  Of course, only shops with WMgate (it‚Äôs also Megastock) are obliged to accept WMZ-WME from you.  The rest are not required.  But for some reason, it turns out that if you want to buy something, as there is certainly a shop that needs plush misch so much ... oh, sorry WMZ-WME, that he is ready to immediately take it from you in exchange for the goods, face value.  Yes, yes, I know it is not registered with WMgate.  But who can forbid him to take WMZ-WME from you in private?  The law can not - this is your personal small party.  Webmoney Transfer does not object either, I quote ‚ÄúThe buyer has the right to transfer the Certificate to a third party to receive goods or services from the list on the website <a href="http://www.wmgate.ru/">www.wmgate.ru</a> .  The Seller does not limit the transfer of the certificate to third parties in whole or in part. ‚Äù  So everything is completely legal. <br><br>  But then again, neponyatka.  Well, the seller took your WMZ-WME from you.  What will he do with them next?  After all, according to the user agreement, he can‚Äôt go anywhere except for Megastock.  But for some reason, it turns out that if he wants to get rid of them, someone appears next to him and says happily: ‚ÄúWell, I need ivy so much ... oh sorry, I need WMZ, that I am ready to take them from you any quantity. " <br><br>  Yes, I almost forgot.  And what do you do if you suddenly think about wasting your WMZ-WME in Megastock?  Nobody is obliged to change them to you for money.  Well, yes, I do not have to.  But somehow it always turns out that it costs you to jabber your e-currency, as a person approaches you, who really needs a plus ... oh, sorry, you need WMZ and you quickly find a common language with it. <br><br>  That's all! <br><br>  An extremely simple and unshakable scheme, which is based on not some complicated legal reasoning, but a popular brand and ... trust.  The question is this: no one guarantees legally that WMZ-WME on your wallet can be exchanged for real dollars and euros, only their purchasing power in specific online stores is guaranteed.  But at the same time, the WebMoney system demonstrates the presence and actual operation of certain mechanisms that support a steady demand for the purchase of this currency. <br><br>  If you believe in the reliability of these mechanisms (and the majority of the participants in the system believe, judging by the speed), then you are the cards.  Do not believe - for God's sake, you have alternatives in the form of other Webman currencies, the redemption of which is very much guaranteed in legal terms, but which at the same time are not as popular as WMZ. <br><br>  We will talk about them another time. <br><br>  Andrey Shipilov <br>  <a href="http://moneynews.ru/article.asp%3Fview%3D8081">Original source</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/7358/">https://habr.com/ru/post/7358/</a></p>
