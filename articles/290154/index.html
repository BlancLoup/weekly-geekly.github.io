Such skills are acquired through trial and error.  One of the authors of <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/the-most-valuable-skills-you-could-have-2015-4">Business Insider</a> created a <a href="http://www.quora.com/What-is-the-most-valuable-skill-a-person-can-have-for-their-entire-life%3Fshare%3D1">thread</a> on Quora.com, in which he asked users to write the most useful acquired skills. <a name="habracut"></a><br><br><ul><li><h4>  Articulation of thoughts and feelings. </h4><br>  It is extremely important for a person to learn to express in words his thoughts.  This skill allows you to share your thoughts and get their assessment from the side. <br></li><li><h4>  Steal from the greats. </h4><br>  Want to be successful?  Learn to steal from the greats.  Or simulate.  As Pablo Picasso said: ‚ÄúGood artists copy, great artists steal ...‚Äù </li><li><h4>  Self discipline. </h4><br>  With self-discipline and perseverance, you can acquire any skill.  The only thing that stops us from doing anything is ourselves.  The inner voice bothers us.  Possession of self-discipline will help suppress it and live by its own rules. </li><li><h4>  Knowledge of your own ignorance. </h4><br>  The only difference between a person who achieves success and a person who does not reach is that one of them did not know what questions to ask. </li><li><h4>  Charisma. </h4><br>  You can be completely impassable stupid and stupid and still be successful.  Many people sincerely want to help a charismatic person.  Charismatic people have a strange ability to instill confidence. </li><li><h4>  The ability to accept things as they are. </h4><br>  Agree, life does not always add up as it may be you want it.  Accept that everything in the world cannot behave as you would like. </li><li><h4>  Other thinking. </h4><br>  Do something better than anyone in the world, even if what you do best occupies a very small niche.  Unique skills are most valuable.  It is impossible not to remember the slogan of Apple - ‚ÄúThink different‚Äù. </li><li><h4>  Empathy. </h4><br>  Everyone has his own cockroaches in his head.  The ability to accept this will pave the way to friendship, mutual understanding and many other fundamental foundations of long-term relationships. </li><li><h4>  Perception of an obstacle as an opportunity. </h4><br>  Obstacles are inevitable.  The weak do not take out, the strong cope, and the great turn them into opportunities.  The most important thing in interference is not they themselves, but how we perceive them and react to them. </li><li><h4>  Quick read. </h4><br>  Learn to read quickly.  It is one of the most simple and accessible tools that can directly create other skills. </li><li><h4>  Mastering the art of conflict. </h4><br>  Mastering this skill will make your mind free.  Unwanted stress will not bother you anymore, and a positive attitude towards the antagonist will save your nerves. </li><li><h4>  Do not take everything to heart. </h4><br>  Leave a heart for loved ones, and use your head to communicate with everyone else.  Emotions cause bias in judgments and make it difficult to see the true picture of what is happening. </li><li><h4>  Sense of humor. </h4><br>  People who know how to make other people laugh like everybody and can cope with any situation by simply turning the conflict into a joke without hurt anyone's feelings. </li></ul></div>
