In the track on the development on the Windows platform you will learn about new products that facilitate the creation of modern responsive applications for a very different range of devices.  Windows does not cease to improve and amaze, becoming even more personalized, facilitating the daily tasks of users.  This allows developers to create new generation solutions and distribute applications using the Windows Store.  We will talk about how to create universal applications and use unique Windows services. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br><cut><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/a94/907/68d/a9490768d1945a61f9ef19af013a24d2.png" width="150" align="left"><br>  The track opens with <b>Dave Crawford</b> , Senior Program Manager, Microsoft, USA.  Dave helps partners develop high-end applications.  For more than 8 years of working with XAML, he designed and created many popular modern Windows applications, including Facebook, Spotify, PayPal, Instagram, etc. Dave has a particular interest in designing user interfaces and collaborates with many leading international companies in this field. .

As Microsoft's corporate vice president at Microsoft, Nick Parker is responsible for international sales, marketing and licensing of pre-installed Windows operating systems on mobile and embedded devices, personal computers and servers manufactured by OEMs and system builders. <br><br><br><hr><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/314/a14/7be/314a147be79ef8cc0b7920cd77963e92.png" width="150" align="left"><br>  <b>Evgeny Shklyar</b> , technology evangelist, Microsoft, Russia, will make a presentation <b>Virtual Reality for Windows 10: Big and Small Secrets</b> .  Virtual reality is a great topic, while there is something to tell about it.  But over time, fresh approaches become obsolete, players demand a new level of realism, and it becomes impossible to keep track of all the diversity.  In this report, you will hear the most current information on how to make friends with VR under Windows 10. <br><br><br><br><hr><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/28f/e6a/62a/28fe6a62ae47bc2d9992b5584c8f816a.png" width="150" align="right"><br>  <b>Mikhail Samarin</b> Business Director, Futurice Ltd, Finland, will make a presentation on <b>Image Processing, Video and Sound Processing in UWP</b> .  For developers of applications using image and sound processing, the Universal Windows Platform offers a very interesting set of libraries and software interfaces with hardware acceleration.  The report will cover and illustrate with examples the following topics: image and video processing with Imaging SDK 3.0, working with low-latency sound and sound effects using Audio Graph, creating music applications integrated with MIDI keyboards.  The report will focus on the adaptability of UWP to both desktop and mobile applications, as well as Continuum devices. <br><br><br><hr><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/6dc/ba1/334/6dcba1334e7dc1e95b1778acdb53ad80.png" width="150" align="left"><br>  <b>Viktor Kiselev</b> Business Development Manager Partners, Microsoft, Russia, will make a presentation <b>Windows Application Store - improvements and new opportunities for developers</b> .  The Windows Store is the main channel for distributing your apps.  Knowing how to use it is key to the development process.  Come to the report to hear all the details about what's new in the Windows Store. <br><br><br><hr><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/0f3/7c6/fc3/0f37c6fc317605af9b68efbda885ff72.png" width="150" align="right"><br>  <b>Dmitry Andreev</b> Technological evangelist, Microsoft, Russia, will make a presentation on <b>how DirectX 12 works</b> .  With the release of DirectX 12 programmers who develop games and applications with intensive graphics, the opportunity to achieve an unprecedented level of performance, and the artists got new approaches to improve the expressive possibilities of the game.  For example, the HLSL 5.1 shaders model allows addressing a huge amount of textures in a pixel shader, limited only by the amount of video memory of the video adapter.  Mechanisms such as bundling make it possible to efficiently use already loaded resources, changing only the parameters of the execution of shaders, which allows you to draw thousands of typical objects in different forms.  Come to the report, and you will learn how to work with the DirectX 12 API and create universal Windows Store applications using this technology. <br><br>  In addition to this, Dmitry will hold a master class on the topic <b>of Computer Vision Technology on the Windows platform</b> .  Understanding the environment with the help of automated systems is one of the most interesting scientific problems.  There have been quite a few discoveries in this area lately that promise many practical applications of these technologies in a variety of scenarios.  During the master class, students will be told about the breakthroughs achieved by computer science in this area, and using practical examples will demonstrate how to create applications using these technologies. <br><br>  You will learn how to: <br><br><ul><li>  Connect the OpenCV-3.0 library to your universal Windows 10 UWP application. </li><li>  How to create universal (UWP) applications of augmented reality on markers. </li><li>  How robots can build a 3D model of the surrounding space using the image from a single camera and navigate it. </li><li>  How to identify anomalies in the video stream, for example, to determine the cyclist in the group of pedestrians. </li><li>  You will learn about the amazing possibilities of modern neural networks for identification, localization of objects in the image, and semantic segmentation. </li><li>  What technologies Windows 10 can be used to recognize faces and identify a person from the video stream. </li><li>  For example, ProjectOxford will show how to determine the age and mood of a person. </li></ul><br><br>  In addition, as part of the master class, many technological techniques and examples of using the Visual Studio toolkit for configuring and building open source libraries in the field of computer vision will be demonstrated. <br><br><br><hr><br><br><h3>  DevCon 2016 </h3><br>  <a href="http://www.msdevcon.ru/">DevCon</a> is the largest Microsoft conference for developers in Russia.
