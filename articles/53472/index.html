  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Trends of social networks</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Today, March 3, the i-Community2009 conference was held. <br>  The day before I interviewed Alexander DOLGIN, manager Imkhonet. <br><br>  <b>What trends seem to you the most relevant for social networks?</b> <br>  There are two main trends: <br>  1.Monetisation of social networks <br>  2. Exit to a different, more advanced level of interpersonal communication in the network.  Simply put, providing users with the opportunity to communicate with whom it is interesting, and what is interesting about. <br>  The first trend is still slipping, the second, on the contrary, is gaining momentum thanks to the introduction of recommender systems on the sites.  One of the most promising sub-trends of this kind is smart dating (dating from a long-range sight). <br>  <b>Are you talking about dating sites or about social networks in general?</b> <br>  I speak as a whole.  On all social services, where there are acquaintances, to do this, by and large, is inconvenient.  The information that users provide about themselves is scanty and often unreliable.  Therefore, upon closer inspection, there are many disappointments.  In addition to personal data, photography plays a big role - but behind the presented appearance there may be something completely different from what you expect.  A person‚Äôs inner baggage is unpacked for a long time.  Solving this problem, Imhonet launched the service " <a href="http://imhonet.ru/users/dating/">Smart Dating</a> ". <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  <b>Does he select people by interests?</b> <br>  Selection by interest is an important component, but not the only and not exclusive - other resources are also selected according to this principle.  For example, "Vkontakte".  In addition, some hobbies are not enough.  Imhonet's novation is that in addition to social interest and interests, he also selects according to tastes.  As my friend Dmitry Itskovich, the head of O.G.I. accurately put it: ‚ÄúI want her to love Tyutcheva ...‚Äù <br>  <b>What is the mechanics of selection?</b> <br>  Selection is carried out using three filters.  The first is socio-demographic.  The second is by interest.  (An important nuance - the service takes into account the degree of interest in one or another hobby: medium, strong, passionate ...) The third filter is a collaborative one.  It unites people by taste.  After all, one thing is just to love tennis (or golf), they can get involved in a variety of people, I would like to find out who has something to talk about on the site or before / after the court. <br>  All three filters can be customized to your liking by receiving different samples of people who meet the specified criteria. <br>  <b>But any filters are kicking ...</b> <br>  Automatic filtering is the primary target-targeting system, a kind of ‚Äúspeed shooting‚Äù.  It does not cancel the communication ‚Äúin the old manner‚Äù.  First, in accordance with your criteria, you set up filters and automatically (literally with one or two clicks) get a selection of like-minded people according to tastes and interests.  You see how much you coincide in your preferences, you see the cultural baggage of these people: the perception of certain books, films, music ... Ie  automatic filtering allows you to quickly get a refined sample.  Further, if something in a person ‚Äúhooked‚Äù you, you can see its blog posts, reviews, comments ... But the fact that the initial sample of several dozen (or even hundreds) people who meet the criteria you set is issued quickly and simply - this very serious step in interpersonal communications.  This is a new global trend. <br>  <b>But such a selection is possible only within the framework of collaborative systems, and is not available to other resources ...</b> <br>  Available through partnerships to which we invite everyone and which are technologically fully prepared by us.  Imkhonet provides its recommendatory functionality (including for ‚ÄúSmart Dating‚Äù) to other sites. <br>  Collaborative filtering technology is ideal for advanced dating and communication: the word collaborative itself means ‚Äúcollaboration.‚Äù  In collaborative systems, forecasts are issued based on judgments of people with similar tastes and preferences.  A mandatory element of the technology is the selection of like-minded people and the formation of clubs according to preferences.  In the ‚ÄúSmart Dating‚Äù this intermediate product is given independent significance (for the first time in the practice of collaborative services).  Thus, the next step has been taken in the development of social services. </div>
