    <h4>  Segment it </h4><br>  We have already written about the importance and basic strategic <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/unisender/blog/130829/">techniques of</a> <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/unisender/blog/131225/">segmentation of</a> your mailing list.  Skillfully segmented base can bring a big return on your email campaigns, since  you increase your chances of avoiding a situation where a user receives an unwanted email.  Consider the case of welcome-email. <br><br>  In order not to harm your database when sending the first letter in the distribution chain, create several such letters and set up the distribution so that the client receives a certain letter depending on where your client came from. <br><br><h4>  Where can the client come from? </h4><br>  Consider the possible options: <br><ol><li>  Subscription on the site. </li><li>  The specific marketing campaign you are pursuing. </li><li>  Buying a base </li><li>  A PPL campaign or a pay-per-lead campaign is a campaign that others are running for you. </li><li>  Other sources. </li></ol><br>  This is far from a complete list and by ‚Äúother sources‚Äù we mean the whole variety of subtle and cunning marketing moves ‚Äî which marketers will not do to build a base for distribution and increase the coverage of an advertising campaign.  Consider each of these cases separately and decide to whom it is better to send some kind of welcome email or ‚Äúday x‚Äù to avoid mistakes and get the desired result. <br><br><h4>  The client came through a subscription on the site </h4><br>  One of the most honest ways to assemble a database is that a person is interested in receiving a newsletter, and this interest is confirmed by filling out the form on your website.  Your welcome-email contains information that the client has registered on the site (with the site indicated) and a link to the registration confirmation (it‚Äôs good to add ‚Äúif you cannot follow the link, copy it to the browser window).  It also adds mandatory lines about the possibility to unsubscribe, as well as a notice that "if you have not registered on the site, do not click the link and ignore this letter."  Thus, a person gets confidence that he came to the right place.  You can strengthen it by saying that you are following a policy on personal data (link), which implies non-proliferation of spam and that you do not transfer data to third parties (if this is true, although in reality you may wish to sell your database one day, then Do not promise what you can not do).  As a rule, such a letter should not include any calls to action, except for the need to confirm the registration in order not to overload the letter: this lead is already in many ways loyal to you and you can do it in x + 1 letter, which, as a rule, is sent via a week or two.  However, you can include the line ‚Äútell us more about you about us‚Äù - unless, of course, you plan to personalize the further mailing in more detail and, accordingly, segment your base more fractionally. <br><br>  In a good way, it would be good if the entire database consisted only of such clients, and your letters each time would meet the needs of the audience and sell the product - more is not necessary.  But it is in an ideal world.  In our imperfect world, only a small number of clients can be collected for the base in this way, so we have to use others. <br><br><h4>  The specific marketing campaign you are pursuing </h4><br>  Within one site you can have several windows where a visitor can leave your data.  In addition to the main window, ‚Äúsign up to receive up-to-date information about us / our products‚Äù - a sufficiently passive way to collect a customer base, you can use more aggressive methods: <br><ul><li>  register to get something for free \ receive from us (of course, relevant to your specifics and interesting for customers); </li><li>  Download for free our new selection of ..., leave a request for notification of the receipt of a new product; </li><li>  do not leave our site so soon, first get for free [something interesting] through registration. </li></ul><br>  There may be several on one site.  This can be a special section that is available on all or just one page, or a pop-up window.  Note here: what was the person subscribing to?  And then your first letter, as in other, and all subsequent ones, must justify the registration.  As a rule, your data is left to get something one-time, but in the registration form you immediately put a window with the tick "I want to receive news from the site \ about products".  True, this tick attentive customer can remove, but it certainly does not happen in 100% of cases, and as a result you get your client.  It has long been said - the term ‚Äúfree download through registration‚Äù is no longer completely free, because  you "pay off" your data. <br><br><h4>  PPL campaign or campaign for the collected lead </h4><br>  This is a campaign that others are conducting for you.  You pay for the collected lead, and they can be collected as the techniques described above, and some other.  In any case, you should be aware of what prompted registration of customers and take into account all the aspects set out in the previous paragraph, when drafting your first letter and subsequent ones. <br><br><h4>  Buying a base </h4><br>  This is the most risky, but, nevertheless, constantly applied way of expanding the client base.  It is necessary to clearly bear in mind that this base does not expect anything from you, moreover, this base will be the least loyal to you, therefore you will need to think carefully about the first letter very carefully. <br><br>  Within our goal with you now is to write the correct first letter in order not to lose a client, we need to take into account exactly where this base comes from.  Of course, buying it you were looking for your potential audience.  It is advisable to immediately say something that will help a person identify you, for example, ‚ÄúYou received this letter, because  you are interested in [and here you need to remember where the base came from] and we decided that this information might be of interest to you. ‚ÄùAnd this time, not with small letters and somewhere‚Äú on the margins ‚Äùof the text.  And then - carefully think over the content.  After that - analyze the return on the newsletter especially carefully. <br><br><h4>  Other sources </h4><br>  Internet marketing is rich in ideas and techniques, so it‚Äôs impossible to talk about everyone in one article, if only because new ones appear every day.  Perhaps you have already invented some new tactics for collecting customer base and want to try it out.  Whatever it is, always remember: your first letter can help you strengthen your base and become a guarantee of a high percentage of ‚Äúread‚Äù or ‚Äúopen‚Äù letters, and can cause customer dissatisfaction and expose all your email marketing threats.  Be careful when writing the first letter to your client segment.  Comments welcome your experience in a similar situation, good moves and mistakes that occurred in your practice. <br><br>  <b>PS</b> More interesting posts and useful links are on our <a href="https://www.facebook.com/UniSenderRussia">facebook page</a> every day, as well as on our blog <a href="http://www.unisender.com/ru/blog/">on the UniSender website</a> .  <a href="https://www.facebook.com/UniSenderRussia"><b>Like?</b></a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/143206/">https://habr.com/ru/post/143206/</a></p>
