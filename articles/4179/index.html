  <section class="page js-page"><h1>bLaugh: Internet comics</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  In June 2006, the <a href="http://blaugh.com/">bLaugh</a> project opened on the Internet, which publishes daily updated comics and humorous stories about Internet technologies.  The authors of the project are artist <a href="http://bradfitzpatrick.com/">Brad Fitzpatrick</a> and journalist <a href="http://chris.pirillo.com/">Chris Pirillo</a> ;  the first draws satirical comics, and the second writes texts.  Chris Pirillo is also known as the organizer of the popular <a href="http://www.gnomedex.com/">Gnomedex</a> conference. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  The objects of their ridicule are famous bloggers and blogger sites.  For example, the authors recently had a good <a href="http://blaugh.com/2006/07/14/digg-digging-diggs-digg/">laugh</a> at the <a href="http://www.digg.com/">Digg</a> site, which literally fixated on itself.  First, thousands of voluntary editors, readers brought to the first page the news about their site, and then - brought to the first page the news that Digg publishes news about itself on the first page.  This second-degree obsession <a href="http://diggdork.com/">turned out to be a</a> great topic for a caricature and an idea for the <a href="http://diggdork.com/">DiggDork.com</a> domain (why do we need domain ideas - more on that later). <br><br>  Other objects of ridicule are large corporations that are trying to take their place in the blogosphere.  The theme of <a href="http://blaugh.com/2006/07/17/microsofts-latest-acquisition/">today's comics</a> was <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/">Microsoft</a> , which announced at a press conference about combining RSS and Atom into a single, new format (domain SyndicationWars.com).  By the way, this is quite a believable joke. <br><br>  It must be said that bLaugh is a unique website of its kind.  Humorous reviews of events in the blogosphere, and even with comics - this has not happened yet.  Chris Pirillo kindly agreed to tell Habrahabru how such an idea occurred to him: ‚ÄúI opened the site a few months ago,‚Äù he says.  ‚ÄúI immediately became convinced of Brad‚Äôs artistic talent as soon as I saw his caricature of Robert Scoble.‚Äù  After that, I offered him the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãwriting libel on the blogosphere.  Initially, I imagined a simple marketing model, but over time we had to find a single sponsor.  <a href="http://www.godaddy.com/">GoDaddy</a> agreed to become one without any hesitation a little less than a month ago.  This company is always looking for new creative ways to increase the popularity of its brand. ‚Äù

      The GoDaddy domain registrar bought all the banners, and also launched an affiliate program together with a humorous website, according to which every GoDaddy client can receive a 10% discount if during the registration of a new domain the name ‚ÄúbLaugh‚Äù is mentioned. <br><br>  <b>Does GoDaddy really like your comics?</b> <br><br>  I think yes, of course.  From their side, it was a matter of faith, because they had never conducted such campaigns before.  To measure effectiveness, they introduced an affiliate program.  And I, in turn, contribute to this process, because every day I publish a link to new, still unregistered domains. <br><br>  <b>How do you work with Brad?</b>  <b>First, he draws a picture, and then you write the text?</b>  <b>How is this process organized?</b> <br><br>  Here the process is rather free.  We have a list of jokes, mostly from my experience.  Sometimes there is a fresh hot topic that you can suck - and we work on it together.  Brad takes the topic, draws a comic, sends it to me, and I write the text.  This is a joint work. <br><br>  <b>Do you know that Sergey Brin is Russian?</b>  <b>Maybe you have some ideas about Russian comics?</b> <br><br>  Oh yes, of course, Sergey is in our field of vision.  We want to create something so ridiculous that <a href="http://www.google.com/">Google has</a> no choice but to buy us for $ 27 million. In fact, our technology of creating comics cannot be copied or repeated in any way. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/4179/">https://habr.com/ru/post/4179/</a></p>
