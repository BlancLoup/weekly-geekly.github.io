Finally, at the Mobile World Congress, traditionally held in Barcelona, ‚Äã‚Äãthe HTC One line was introduced to the public, with the announcement of which the company moved away from the traditional endowment of models with their own names.  Each unit received a short letter designation and clear positioning. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/78c/2f2/721/78c2f2721bbc6209371f90a6d68e7324.jpg" alt="HTC One"></div><br><br>  At the same time, the presence of a set of common features is typical for all models: the latest version of the Android operating system, Ice Cream Sandwich, is preinstalled, the camera has been drastically improved and has received ImageSense technology, and the Sense proprietary interface, so popular among smartphone users, has been updated to the fourth version.

    <a name="habracut"></a><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/dcd/138/893/dcd13889343e95c8ed244fab49749547.jpg"></div><br><br>  This time, the HTC One S came under scrutiny. This may not be the flagship of the current lineup, but One S will not disappoint users with its characteristics.  In addition, it was in its production that a number of technological innovations were involved, which makes this device truly unique. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/97c/cfe/d54/97ccfed549c413cd116d9aa7ff56a97b.jpg"></div><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/745/d38/c1d/745d38c1d476733a5394c698159ee491.jpg"></div><br><br>  So, with each case produced for the HTC One S, plasma electrolytic oxidation is performed.  It consists in passing a high voltage electric current through the metal, which makes it possible to obtain a much more durable material.  As a basis for the One S case, a unibody aluminum billet is taken, which is subjected to a current treatment with a voltage of 10,000 volts!  In addition to giving unsurpassed strength, five times superior to traditional aluminum, the bodies that have undergone this procedure are painted in a unique and rich shade of black. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/7d2/6bc/d45/7d26bcd45e3f3711b8cac0b7ee72550b.jpg"></div><br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/97e/9f9/93f/97e9f993f8fb928b9efdb33ace5beeb9.jpg"></div><br><br>  Thus, you can not worry about the state of the body of the HTC One S in normal operating conditions.  Of course, do not prick them with nuts or hammer nails, no smartphone can withstand such treatment.  But if you accidentally put the device in one pocket with the keys - do not worry, nothing terrible will happen. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/351/991/cd4/351991cd48e6bc734c6f84952aee4a5d.jpg"></div><br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/02a/5c3/975/02a5c39753c802ae8d463315a1ebc3e1.jpg"></div><br><br>  Possessing a 4.3-inch (11 cm) display, the device was able to maintain dimensions that were acceptable to most users.  In addition to the record strength of the main material, the novelty also boasts a very thin body, the thickness of which is only 7.8 mm.  The width of the device: 65 mm, and the length is 131 mm with a total weight of 119 g. Thus, it will not be difficult to put it in a shirt pocket, not to mention the inner pocket of a jacket or preferred wearing in trousers. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/c6f/498/a52/c6f498a5296c89604b50510dd89f9d81.jpg"></div><br><br>  The screen resolution of the HTC One S is 960x540 pixels (qHD), and it is made using Super AMOLED technology, which allows you to enjoy the natural black color, as well as see the rich and high-quality picture under any lighting conditions.  If the back wall of the device is made of aluminum and is resistant to mechanical stress, then its facade can boast a certain strength, because the protective glass of the display is made using Gorilla Glass technology and is not afraid of scratches.  Capacitive display with multi-touch is distinguished by responsiveness and good readability in the sun, and automatic brightness control, as a rule, correctly selects the desired value and does not force you to turn to the settings, peering at menu items. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/4d3/573/b4f/4d3573b4f82a418cf82996b52d1c26f0.jpg"></div><br><br>  Filling the device to match the appearance - a 1.5-GHz dual-core processor based on the Qualcomm Snapdragon S4 SoC (Krait core) works in tandem with the Adreno 225 graphics accelerator. The combination of these components, as well as a whole GB of RAM, does not question high performance smartphone, which is easily confirmed by numerous runs in synthetic tests, as well as real-life experience. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/c9b/3ba/ce6/c9b3bace619eb667f60093eb1f3d22c7.jpg"></div><br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/521/c2a/ea0/521c2aea0ee23fb7e334c5b0c8085fcd.jpg"></div><br><br>  The internal memory in the device is 16 GB, while the user has about 12 GB for installing applications and storing data.  If this volume seems small, cloud technologies will come to the rescue: 25 GB in Dropbox for two years, provided to each buyer of new smartphones of the company.  After this time, your files are not deleted, it will only be impossible to load new content over the expired quota. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/af4/3f7/ebb/af43f7ebbf1ecf524c21efff21fead69.jpg"></div><br><br>  To simplify the process of integrating a cloud service into everyday life, it is enough to activate the automatic upload of the taken photos to the selected folder of your Dropbox.  Upon returning home or to work it is very pleasant to find the photos taken already on the computer. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/9c2/b8a/686/9c2b8a686b4f709ded6079413e15a6e5.jpg"></div><br><br>  Of course, one can not tell about the camera.  Taking into account the wishes of numerous users of the products of the NTS, in the process of developing the One line, this component was given the closest attention. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/0bc/2e3/96a/0bc2e396aee3e61a8cab07b61c57fe50.jpg"></div><br><br>  Let's start, as expected, with the technical characteristics.  The resolution of the CMOS-sensor is 8 megapixels, which allows you to take pictures of 3264x2448 pixels with a traditional aspect ratio of 4: 3.  However, the displays of modern display devices are becoming more and more widespread, and the cameras of smartphones are also not lagging behind.  Taking into account the fact that the screen of the device itself is also widescreen, it is exactly such proportions that are activated by default.  The final image has a resolution of 3264x1840 pixels and looks great on modern TVs and monitors. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/52d/315/b99/52d315b99133ca52eabc2e81912b60f6.jpg"></div><br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/b2e/b07/6e6/b2eb076e62f36db7fc9e7f1bf3658232.jpg"></div><br><br>  The optical system of the HTC One S camera has a f / 2.0 aperture ratio that allows you to capture 40% more light in a wide-angle 28 mm lens than the matrices with aperture ratio f / 2.4 that are traditionally used in mobile phones.  In addition, in order to improve the image characteristics, a matrix backlight illumination technology (BSI) has been applied, which makes it possible to avoid additional noise in low light conditions. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/282/9f4/bad/2829f4badcc611acf768942faea97ae5.jpg"></div><br><br>  For shooting contrasting scenes with difficult conditions, as well as objects in backlight (for example, against the sun), the HDR (High Dynamic Range) mode is useful, probably familiar to digital photo lovers. <br><br>  All the advantages of the NTS camera are combined in ImageSense technology, the heart of which is the special image-processing processor HTC ImageChip.  Due to the highest speed of focusing, you can get a ready-made picture in just 0.7 seconds, and even less is needed to launch the camera. <br><br>  Continuous shooting also does not disappoint fans of shooting dynamic scenes - by holding the camera button, you can save an unlimited number of frames.  At the end of the series, the taken pictures will appear in a convenient preview window, right in which the best photo is selected, while all the others are deleted without clogging up the memory of the smartphone with the same type of images. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/42d/1f6/8bc/42d1f68bc047d8561c854ed0890dc653.gif"><br><br>  However, no one bothers to save all the pictures taken, and to activate the serial shooting you don‚Äôt need to go into the settings, just tick the appropriate box, and the phone is ready to take several frames per second immediately after starting the camera, so you can always count on it. <br><br>  The remaining regimes are also worthy of attention, but their presence is more likely to be expected and is something for granted.  Separately, it is worth noting the function of recognition of faces and smiles, which perfectly manifests itself in the group portrait mode.  Not forgotten, and customizable separate on-screen LED flash, automatically turned off depending on the selected shooting mode. <br><br>  Of course, the new HTC One S is able to shoot panoramic photos, and the algorithm for creating them is perhaps the most convenient one presented to date.  It is enough to select the corresponding item in the mode selection menu, as all that remains is to smoothly move the smartphone along the imaginary axis of the panorama.  Having discovered the next frame in the lens's field of view, the HTC One S signals this with a green frame in the viewfinder and activates the shutter itself.  The number of photos involved in the combination of the panoramic image is not limited, it all depends on the available angle of view. <br><br>  Subsequent processing is done quite quickly and quite correctly.  So, if you do not particularly move the smartphone in different planes, you will not see the joints and other annoying trifles, as a rule, spoiling the impression of beautiful panoramas. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/318/984/8e7/3189848e7638595586f24db8d1b3f641.jpg"></div><br><br>  Basically, the phone is still removed automatically, without bothering to learn the settings, and this is completely justified.  In this aspect, the ease of use and speed of the camera comes to the fore.  The unprecedentedly short time required for launching and framing, we have already affected.  And if you put the camera icon in the lower dock, it is easy to launch it directly from the lock screen, saving a couple more precious moments.  Sometimes this will allow you to take a unique picture. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/e94/be9/b97/e94be9b97015a32842c5ccce51412b27.jpg"></div><br><br>  Not to be unsubstantiated, we made a fairly voluminous comparison of the HTC One S camera with another well-known Android-smartphone, the module in which also clearly did not disappoint.  This is the Samsung Galaxy Note, the camera of which has a resolution of 8 megapixels and a fairly successful sensor that allows the use of a product from a Korean company as a replacement for a digital soap box. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/a91/c0e/a70/a91c0ea70eacf43450cc7c94dd434455.jpg"></div><br><br>  Based on the scenarios of typical use of cameras in smartphones, we carefully avoided changing numerous settings, and the pictures were taken exclusively in automatic mode without any preprocessing, including brightness, contrast, saturation, white balance and other indicators.  In our opinion, it is extremely important that the user be able to immediately get a suitable for further use frame, without losing any guess as to the required level of saturation or exposure compensation.  Such subtleties are justified application in serious photographic equipment, but quite different tasks are put before it. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/c8c/a2d/589/c8ca2d589476bf29b6e1af4756e7621d.jpg"></div><br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/63c/7b9/9e6/63c7b99e66af62d3b7ba748d3fcb5545.jpg"></div><br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/931/57c/000/93157c0009d8f54a6ff5b102cde5b6d8.jpg"></div><br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/512/7b7/694/5127b769457f854844dfabfdca5635e7.jpg"></div><br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/4fd/673/7fe/4fd6737feff208cf251953198635b4ce.jpg"></div><br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/608/ee3/ef9/608ee3ef9552dfca399367d47a55c496.jpg"></div><br><br>  Thus, in various lighting conditions, indoors and in the open air, several shots were taken successively (from three to five), from which the best were subsequently selected and outright unsuccessful were eliminated (with white-balance misses, incorrect focusing, etc. .). <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/76b/bc9/fae/76bbc9fae1bbf62ebdbe0671ed4b7394.jpg"></div><br><br>  We suggest you to familiarize yourself with the examples of images.

mode manifests itself in all its glory, and when shooting objects in difficult lighting conditions, it can help out a lot by highlighting the necessary details and moderating the sunlight, which the spring weather finally began to delight us. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/56b/3a2/285/56b3a2285ec17930d83658bd24a77867.jpg"><br><br>  Show your creative abilities without leaving the camera application.  15 excellent custom effects will give your pictures a unique charm, while maintaining their original resolution, which rarely can boast of popular online services for modifying images.  For effects such as "depth of field" or "vignette", the desired area is flexibly adjusted, and the lower slider is responsible for changing the scale. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/4f1/e02/4f4/4f1e024f4bc8224d2e50590265047e13.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/fee/26a/82b/fee26a82b8217f3fa846ad8b1298b8ee.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/78f/dcf/fc1/78fdcffc134d6d13716b82b4700ed335.jpg"><br><br>  In this case, all the necessary details are guaranteed to get into the frame, and the photo will acquire a unique appearance that you cannot but share with your friends. <br><br>  Not to mention the possibility of recording video.  Shooting is done in MPEG4 format, and the resolution of the videos varies up to FullHD (1920x1080).  Such records can be easily shown to friends, as well as form a home archive of cute incidents and interesting impressions based on them.  Lovers of accurate data are informed that the h264 codec is used to record video, and the sound is recorded in stereo.  In turn, the audio format is AAC, and the bitrate is 1536 kilobits per second.  Yes, more recently, not all cameras could boast of such indicators. <br><br>  Videos with Internet access are also synchronized using the Dropbox service, so do not worry that you may run out of storage space, in the cloud it will be enough. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/1de/564/a3f/1de564a3f8130a604accc42b1b358bf0.jpg"><br><br>  A separate item in the mode selection menu is a slow motion video, which can be very useful if you need to capture something particularly dynamic.  Resolution when choosing this type of record is somewhat reduced, but 768x432 pixels is enough to get an idea of ‚Äã‚Äãthe subject of the survey. <br><br>  In the end, you can not think about what better reflect what is happening around you.  Buttons for recording photos and videos are displayed on the screen at the same time, and there is no need to switch between them in any way, unlike the one practiced in other smartphones.  On the contrary, if you start shooting video on the HTC One S, then no one makes it impossible to take pictures in full resolution, just press the shutter key, the video recording is not interrupted. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/788/edc/09a/788edc09a9deeda22f59f9002d964b9d.png"></div><br><br>  Like continuous shooting, this function brings to mind an arsenal of advanced SLR cameras, and this comparison is definitely in favor of an ultramodern, but still smart phone that can replace a lot of specialized devices. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/81f/75d/3ef/81f75d3ef0c5de07406c15e4aac270e5.png"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/6a5/924/b55/6a5924b55bb705782a75fef9ad4f1981.png"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/dd2/a5e/be4/dd2a5ebe4cf41883df04978293e269a4.png"><br><br>  Working on Android 4.0 Ice Cream Sandwich OS, the HTC One S provides a unique opportunity for users who are used to the comfortable look of the Sense shell.  Like in other models of the One line, it uses the proprietary interface Sense 4.0, bringing a qualitatively new user experience to the owners of new smartphones NTS. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/58e/584/85f/58e58485fdcb8c8946cfb2d71f33f30c.png"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/ca8/701/b91/ca8701b91c56554f1b01c3c77e263fca.png"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/f33/ebb/dfb/f33ebbdfba72ad140de531ecb6aafc40.png"><br><br>  There is a support for innovations inherent in the fourth version of the OS from Google, and the familiar interface, subjected to high-quality processing and optimization.  In the settings you can find options such as unlocking the device on the face of the owner (face-unlock), as well as the activation of hardware acceleration for all applications.  Of particular interest is the section on options for developers. <img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/bf2/1a2/5f8/bf21a25f819a6fca7a75d313bf2cf240.png"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/28e/35f/a2b/28e35fa2bd43b90ed41027b754e488ca.png"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/30c/77d/98a/30c77d98a386c42c4db8ffb0e606096f.png"><br><br>  Previously, similar elements could be found only in third-party firmware (for example, CyanogenMod).  The novelty from the NTS, as they say, out of the box offers a clear indication of CPU usage and system information, tracking of touches and displaying other data so necessary for developers for the correct and correct operation of their applications. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/5f5/1c6/7f7/5f51c67f7718d77b24163b3be15e6376.png"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/560/9c0/742/5609c0742405b87a150afe26aeac17fe.png"><br><br>  Let not everyone devote themselves to the development and improvement of software, but many happen to music, and here One S will find something to surprise.  Radically redesigned music player.  Now the music stored in the device‚Äôs memory is just one of the available sources of content, and the pre-installed SoundHound and TuneIn Radio applications will allow you to open new horizons and find interesting performers you may not even have suspected.  Shortcuts related to listening to music programs are easily added to the main screen of the player, and a full-screen player control widget allows you to perform all the basic operations directly from one of your desktops. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/cc4/210/5d7/cc42105d714e5869ee656b49557cad96.png"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/8fb/188/98e/8fb18898eeb1f2aee904220364af83bf.png"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/7d1/2a5/ae7/7d12a5ae731cd8f3789c4366b95a008e.png"><br><br>  We should not forget that the smartphone supports proprietary technology Beats Audio, and in the settings of the equalizer, you can adjust the sound for a specific model of Beats headphones, including urBeats headsets and Beats Solo overhead headphones, as well as some other models.  But even with other accessories you will be pleasantly surprised by the sound quality.  Having achieved the desired sound with the help of numerous equalizer presets, you will only have to enjoy high-quality sound, which also has a good volume margin. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/81c/bdc/533/81cbdc533bacd234a91d0fa32c02ad2d.png"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/974/068/d16/974068d16946d4bceae613c01d4023cc.png"><br><br>  Even playing through the speaker does not disappoint, the apparatus is vociferous and will surely let you know about an incoming call or a new notification with your favorite tune. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/5d9/db0/5ca/5d9db05caf848d2944e7e143e7d996ac.png"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/21f/77a/c52/21f77ac52c799efc630dc1b8d1349b79.png"><br><br>  The loudspeaker is located on the back wall, in the lower part of the case, but do not be afraid to drown it by placing the smartphone, for example, on the table.  This becomes possible due to the verified shape of the body, in profile resembling a light and very thin arc.  However, the protective coating of the display will not allow to worry about the safety of the device, even if you put it screen down. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/a51/903/678/a51903678136b2addf4c17a06fa22ea3.png"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/4cb/99b/e61/4cb99be61ef6ae89042502fa41d25c1d.png"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/61a/991/efc/61a991efcf28c0af284d18db263017d9.png"><br><br>  Returning to the interface, it should be noted its extremely high responsiveness and speed.  Scrolling through the desktops, opening the list of applications, launching your programs and switching between them - these operations have never been lightning fast! <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/838/a3e/bdd/838a3ebdd54ab2968dcf1be8a0f76242.png"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/1b2/ac5/63a/1b2ac563a9740d72873c8549e122789b.png"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/9e9/199/c1e/9e9199c1e38f95c647a48ec11d80630b.png"><br><br>  You can customize the appearance of the device to your liking, choosing from a variety of widgets, shortcuts, application icons and services, placing them on your desktops in the desired order. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/4bb/a9d/b4f/4bba9db4fed5233e33ae808f82db0c5a.png"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/efe/33d/d69/efe33dd69339f2cbfa7599f032f8a518.png"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/2db/fa3/a45/2dbfa3a4518f0e0b5c616c7a829329a7.png"><br><br>  The latter can be up to seven pieces, but if you don‚Äôt need that much, it‚Äôs easy to use the usual scaling gesture to go to the panel control screen, delete the extra ones, or, on the contrary, add the missing ones. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/5da/a77/e64/5daa77e64ea64d99a5258c93f71111a2.png"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/945/d3a/5dd/945d3a5dd40a58d4691cecd355ba5e58.png"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/f9e/566/0ac/f9e5660ac548c36d32594e512a3ade28.png"><br><br>  By default, shortcuts are created for new applications, but if you want to fully control the process of filling the desktops, this option can be turned off. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/1ca/c09/b8f/1cac09b8f939b23236700ea92259f802.png"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/d5e/a5d/ee6/d5ea5dee61ef29774bb3afbf06f1d1f5.png"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/3f0/476/ad0/3f0476ad0a44e8e3d03a1a9f6699f568.png"><br><br>  Folders are now created by simply dragging one icon onto another, and the thumbnails of the programs placed in them are visually displayed on desktops.  It is also not forbidden to create a folder and place it in the dock to quickly open the desired directory directly from the lock screen. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/376/514/8d2/3765148d26bed7d85d012f255e0b17f2.png"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/4a3/616/de6/4a3616de62df24b72c82e035894e50b0.png"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/ce9/f01/83a/ce9f0183aefc523de4c902623d6817a5.png"><br><br>  Due to the fact that Android 4.0 ICS is preinstalled on the device, the button for switching applications along with the familiar ‚ÄúHome‚Äù and ‚ÄúBack‚Äù is presented in the bottom row.  The functions of the ‚ÄúMenu‚Äù button are taken over by its on-screen counterpart, which is part of the Action Bar element in ICS-optimized applications. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/6b5/138/baf/6b5138baf70e273cdcbb32f00f40a48d.png"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/a94/94f/cc9/a9494fcc908c24c94332dca8f499848a.png"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/3e1/a6a/47f/3e1a6a47fa779007b64d0c7dd116fc8d.png"><br><br>  The standard for the Android system, the monitor of cellular traffic is complemented by visual counters of data transmitted over Wi-Fi, as well as calls made from this phone.  If tracking mobile data with a limited Internet connection will prevent unnecessary spending, but other indicators, at a minimum, will save time on finding and installing an additional third-party utility designed to perform the same functions. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/b63/c58/532/b63c5853274e5073b588bc580d0b459e.png"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/a51/903/678/a51903678136b2addf4c17a06fa22ea3.png"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/4cb/99b/e61/4cb99be61ef6ae89042502fa41d25c1d.png"><br><br>  Task Manager has also been reworked compared to the standard version for Ice Cream Sandwich, it has become clearer, and applications can be closed with a simple gesture of scrolling upwards.  However, the presence of a gigabyte of RAM HTC One S is unlikely to force you to free up resources in manual mode. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/cd9/4cd/94b/cd94cd94b45b9a35e3b4a45cbf720562.png"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/af2/644/0b6/af26440b6f50a5608e91936f5d4aae9d.png"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/3ce/6fb/43f/3ce6fb43f711fc28eecb4721fafd3161.png"><br><br>  For information, you can bring screenshots of popular benchmarks, including NenaMark, SmartBench 2012, Vellamo, Electopia, AnTuTu and the famous Quadrant.  As you can see, the results are quite impressive, in some cases the stuffing of the One S allowed to set records in its category. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/950/503/cef/950503cefd1f67d486baf78275d124a7.png"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/ae3/b64/00b/ae3b6400ba8ecbd21595664badd1d742.png"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/466/028/ff5/466028ff588b629070c499c2306d9eda.png"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/950/d7d/154/950d7d154ab9cdccae5d933ff9065b51.png"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/a96/e38/5c0/a96e385c0fed96051ca4cb1664ca6633.png"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/17d/586/9d8/17d5869d8794c6d211e94ef9461f83a0.png"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/e00/1ba/7ba/e001ba7ba737f4d9c835cb5d4a4af9c1.png"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/776/af8/57b/776af857be7bc55a81405aa959ed8ed0.png"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/99e/c21/6dc/99ec216dcd15f49b9edff2749d52409b.png"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/57c/4ca/b93/57c4cab93d4243712f370b7b8c3bab37.png"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/9ea/de9/eb0/9eade9eb0d8ee3e96dc510ca257ed890.png"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/e60/08e/8b9/e6008e8b930d244c71b0af0dac531b97.png"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/2a8/c84/dcd/2a8c84dcdc75b0f783d4ffb44c9dd138.png"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/3c0/c63/8a3/3c0c638a377ebda899b7682b5607ac69.png"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/5c5/5f8/c2f/5c55f8c2f54db2d5bf323dc80ab5025e.png"><br><br>  Such powerful components involuntarily make you think about the battery life of a smartphone - one of the most important indicators for a mobile essential device.  The results of testing have shown that with active use of the device during the day, the socket will not be required until late in the evening. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/b90/fd1/e86/b90fd1e863942e92a995eee98e877507.jpg"><br><br>  However, by that time you will probably need rest too.  In a more benign mode with active cellular connection, automatic adjustment of screen brightness and standard usage profile, including calls, Internet access, updating social network tapes, using the camera and listening to music, HTC One S easily keeps the battery for 24 hours, which is good.  Yes, and the device is charged quickly enough, it takes less than an hour and a half when using a network adapter, so that it is ready to work again. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/ec5/98d/af9/ec598daf94b3ab6106836efeb9e81f5a.jpg"><br><br>  In order to display more relevant data to your location, HTC One S uses not only information from the cellular network, but also, with your permission, GPS / GLONASS coordinates.  The Bluetooth version of the device is 4.0, which means that with appropriate support on the receiving side, you can share files at extremely high speeds, similar to a point-to-point Wi-Fi connection. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/318/cfb/c84/318cfbc841920a525f7c089b1faa001a.jpg"><br><br>  HSPA + / HSUPA support will not let you get bored in the third generation networks, and enjoying the joys of the mobile Internet is quite simple - you just need to change the standard SIM card for a new microSIM format at your operator‚Äôs office for free. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/708/c5f/a07/708c5fa0788ca8dbf23823dd743241f1.jpg"><br><br>  If you take a closer look at the device, it will be easy to notice a lot of minor improvements that bring much-needed comfort to the device.  This is an updated keyboard with easily replenished vocabulary, predicting the words you have entered and supporting ‚Äústrokes‚Äù, and an improved algorithm for adding elements to desktops ... However, all these little things are better to try on the HTC One line-of-business devices presented in the company and retail. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/143771/">https://habr.com/ru/post/143771/</a></p>
