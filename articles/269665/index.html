By the way, rule number 9 - if you're stuck, make a list of what can't happen - suitable for writers working in any genre. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><ol><li>  Admire the character for his efforts more than for his success. </li><li>  Give preference to what is interesting to you as a spectator, and not to what a writer is fun to do.  These two parameters can be very different. </li><li>  Striving for the expression of a keynote is great, but until you finish the story, you cannot understand what it really is.  Now rewrite it again. </li><li>  Once upon a time ... They lived every day ... And once ... Because of this ... Because of that ... Until finally ... </li><li>  Simplify.  Concentrate.  Combine characters.  Do not be distracted by minor plots.  You may feel that you are missing something important, but you will be more free. </li><li>  What does your character do well that he likes?  Give it the exact opposite.  Challenge.  And how will he handle it? </li><li>  Come up with an end before the middle.  In reality, the endings are harder to come up with, so make sure that your work is done in advance. </li><li>  After finishing the story, set it aside, even if it is imperfect.  In an ideal world, everything would be different.  Next time you do better. </li><li>  If you get stuck, make a list of what can NOT happen.  Often after this you find the right material. </li><li>  Disassemble the stories you like.  What you like about them is a part of you - you need to recognize it before you can use it. </li><li>  You can fix the idea only after you make it on paper.  If she stays in your head, you cannot share it. </li><li>  Drop the first thing that comes to mind.  And then the second, third, fourth and fifth.  All obvious things.  Surprise yourself. </li><li>  Equip your character with an opinion.  Passive and flexible characters may like you, but not your audience. </li><li>  Why do you need to tell exactly this story?  Which of your beliefs feeds her?  Is her heart? </li><li>  How would you feel if you were in the place of your character?  Honesty adds credibility to unbelievable situations. </li><li>  What is at stake?  Why do we have to worry about the character?  What happens if they do not succeed?  Reduce their chances. </li><li>  Work in vain does not disappear.  If this does not work now, put the idea aside - it will definitely come in handy in another place. </li><li>  Know yourself and feel the difference between achieving the best result and worrying about trivia. </li><li>  Accidents, characters in trouble, play well.  Accidents, helping them out, look like a hoax. </li><li>  Exercise: Take the parts of the movie that you didn‚Äôt like.  How would you redistribute them so that you like it? </li><li>  You need to identify yourself with the situation and the character.  What would make you personally act like that? </li><li>  Is this the essence of your story?  How to effectively tell her?  Be defined, and make a start from it. </li></ol></div>
