The investigation team of the Prosecutor General‚Äôs Office was not at all satisfied with the arrest of the defendants already in existence and is now planning to question a number of other people connected with the banking business. <br><br>  Among those who are interested in the investigation into the ‚ÄúKozlov case‚Äù are the heroes of another scandalous criminal epic - about the embezzlement and laundering of tens of millions of dollars that had disappeared from the Central Bank of Turkmenistan.

    <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  Investigators leading the case of the murder of the first deputy chairman of the Central Bank of the Russian Federation intend to interrogate Isoltan Niyazov, Chairman of the Board of Directors of Moscow Industrial Expert Bank (Indebank), Yevgeny Obzhirov, Chairman of the Board of the same bank.  True, A. Niyazov and S. Burshtein have been on the wanted list for a long time in the ‚ÄúTurkmen‚Äù case, and now the prosecutor‚Äôs office has instructed the police to maximize their search. <br><br>  As far as we know, E. Obzirov in the framework of the "Turkmen" or some other case has not been put forward the charges, but the operatives cannot find him now.  What is the reason for such activity in the investigation of the ‚ÄúKozlov case‚Äù, so far we can only assume, the newspaper notes.  Among other things, this can be explained by the result of studying the personal records and papers of A. Kozlov seized from his home and office after the murder.  Perhaps, the investigation concluded that Aleksey Frenkel, the main suspect in organizing the murder to date, was not the only customer to eliminate the deputy chairman of the Central Bank or even acted as an intermediary, or perhaps the prosecutor‚Äôs office found another mark on the matter. <br><br>  As a law enforcement source told the newspaper, last week, the Prosecutor General‚Äôs Office, in connection with the ‚ÄúKozlov case‚Äù, all divisions of the Ministry of Internal Affairs received an oral order to raise all old criminal cases (primarily suspended or suspended) concerning capital banks and bankers.  The first such case, which attracted the attention of detectives, is connected precisely with the theft of "Turkmen Millions". <br><br>  It began in September 2002, when it was discovered that several employees of the Central Bank of Turkmenistan, who had access to the international electronic banking payment system SWIFT, were withdrawing large sums from the reserve account of the Central Bank of Turkmenistan at Deutsche Bank, having stolen a total of about $ 40 million (by the way, just yesterday, according to Vremya Novostey, the former deputy chairman of the Central Bank of Turkmenistan, Annadurdy Khodzhiev, one of the defendants in the case of embezzling these funds, was detained in Sofia.  When the scam came to light, it turned out that this money was transferred to the accounts of dummy firms in different countries, and about $ 20 million went to Moscow. <br><br>  The authorities of Turkmenistan appealed to the Russian special services for help, who found out that the stolen millions were cashed through Indexbank and the Russian Depositary Bank (RDB) (both banks were soon deprived of a license).  Within the framework of this criminal case, the head of the RDB, Dmitry Leus, was sentenced to 4 years in prison in 2004, while the leaders of Indexbank, A. Niyazov and S. Burstein, disappeared from the investigation and were put on a wanted list.  E.Obzhirov was also interrogated then, but he remained a witness in the case. <br><br>  Thus, the investigative group of the Prosecutor General‚Äôs Office, studying the lists of banks deprived of licenses at different times by order of A. Kozlov, came to the conclusion that the persons involved in these cases might be involved in the murder of a banker.  According to the Vremya Novostey source, the investigation has already established that A. Kozlov back in 1998 made up a blacklist of about 1.5 thousand banks that were cashing money.  The list includes Indexbank. <br><br>  A. Kozlov then temporarily left the Central Bank, but the banks for his materials were deprived of licenses.  The bankers, according to the investigation, then resorted to another tactic: they began to create small banks for a period of 2-3 months specifically for cash withdrawal and after a series of operations declared themselves bankrupt.  After A. Kozlov returned to work at the Central Bank in 2002, he found out that the same financiers are behind these scams.  And the latter, in the opinion of the Vremya Novostey source in the Ministry of the Interior, could eventually decide that the deputy chairman of the Central Bank is easier to ‚Äúremove‚Äù than to invent something new again. <br><br>  A source in the Prosecutor General‚Äôs Office, in turn, also said that the investigation had already precisely established the identity of the organizers of the murder of A. Kozlov.  They, according to the source, is a group of ‚Äúoffended‚Äù bankers at various times.  ‚ÄúThese people are absolutely confident in their impunity,‚Äù said the source.  - And the accused Aleksey Frenkel is obviously just a pawn in this game.  He was just the first to come into the field of view of law enforcement structures that had shown intense activity.  And the mediator Liana Askerova, after her confession, gave up her words. ‚Äù <br><br>  Source: <a href="http://dengin.ru/kozlov/V-dele-ob-ubiistve-A-Kozlova-mozhet-byt-zameshan-ewe-odin-bank/">Dengin.ru</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/3514/">https://habr.com/ru/post/3514/</a></p>
