And you can not argue with that. <br>  The legendary ex-CEO of General Electric, Jack Welch, who knows everything about business, and his wife, former editor-in-chief of the Harvard Business Review, who knows how to write about business, more than 200 pages of useful information, as well as some don't get an MBA in two years. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Without much water and reasoning, but despite this, in an accessible form, the authors tell us about the subtleties of the ‚Äúgame‚Äù in business: about finance and marketing, about globalization and crises, about the mission and values ‚Äã‚Äãof the company.  They know where you can make a mistake or get confused - they themselves were young and inexperienced, now they are ready to tell us everything they learned during their careers. <br><br>  A separate part of the book is devoted to the main pillar of any company - the team.  How to be a good leader?  How to build trust in the team?  Whom to praise, who to support, and who urgently dismiss?  What are the real responsibilities of HR service?  How to manage different types of employees, including those who are smarter than you in some area?  Jack and Suzy answer all these questions specifically, in detail and clearly. <br><br>  Well, the last part is just a gift for beginning managers and specialists.  ‚ÄúAbout you‚Äù is a part dedicated to self-identification and development of your career.  How to determine the area in which you are really interested in developing?  How to accelerate your career growth?  How to get out of the professional impasse in which you somehow found yourself? <br>  This part inspires the reader to move forward, and this is wonderful.

      Summarizing, I can say that the book is read easily and quickly and will be useful to all who care about their professional path.  A student graduating from a university will find in it a description of the basics of business and a story about what he needs to do in order to reach heights.  A newly appointed manager will reveal the secrets of managing a team, as well as warnings about situations that he may fall into.  An experienced manager will be able to apply to his company the entire amount of knowledge of the legendary top manager of a huge corporation, and will certainly find useful information. <br><br>  Read, absorb, use in practice and good luck in your business and career. <br><br>  <i>‚ÄúNothing is over until it is over‚Äù</i> <br>  Book: Instead of MBA <br>  Authors: Jack Welch, Suzy Welch <br>  Publisher: <a href="http://www.mann-ivanov-ferber.ru/books/vmesto-mba/">Mann, Ivanov and Ferber</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/299808/">https://habr.com/ru/post/299808/</a></p>
