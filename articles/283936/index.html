And, although even now one can meet a skeptic who insists that working at home leads not only to a deterioration in professional relationships, but also to a decrease in labor productivity, most American employers are becoming more and more lenient for this alternative work environment.

      Regardless of whether you work at your home once a month or every day, there are several key rules that you can <a href="http://blog.mbaconsult.ru/blog/personal/10-urokov-o-tom-kak-povysit-produktivnost-kotorye-ya-usvoil-rabotaya-po-90-chasov-v-nedelyu-tselyy-mesjac/">do to work as efficiently as possible</a> .  Yes, work from home has a lot of advantages, but you have to work hard to use most of them.  Apply these rules to practice in work at home. <br><br><h2>  <font color="#0071c5">1. Set a specific work area</font> </h2><br>  This zone will be your ‚Äúhome office‚Äù.  Working while lying in bed is unlikely to be a good idea because of the constant desire to rest or sleep.  Do not help the work and standing in front of you TV in the living room, causing a constant desire to watch it.  Create a space specifically designed for work that does not occupy the entire room, but is free from various distracting items and not used for other purposes than your work.  Thus, the very stay in the "home office" will tune in to the workplace and help you focus on your business. <br><br><h2>  <font color="#0071c5">2. Work clothes</font> </h2><br>  Many would like to work, not paying attention to their clothes - for example, in their pajamas.  However, there is a certain psychological meaning to dressing in working style, even being at home.  Naturally, you should not constantly wear a jacket and tie, but it‚Äôs worth spending a little time to bring yourself into a relatively professional look.  This will help you to go mentally to work mode, avoiding the temptation of the "pajama" mode.  In addition, this style of clothing is useful if you suddenly have to use Skype or any other connection that uses video.  Speaking of communications ... <br><br><h2>  <font color="#0071c5">3. Use different communication methods.</font> </h2><br>  Working at home, learn to use the maximum amount of communication with other people: telephone, e-mail, text and voice messages, video chats and various instant messengers.  Perhaps some of these methods will seem preferable to others, however, in order to work as effectively as possible in your ‚Äúhome office‚Äù, you need to master almost all types of communication.  Because there are situations when, for example, communication by phone is impossible, and the most convenient option would be an email.  In another case, a video call will help to better understand the interlocutor than any instant messages.  Apply each of these methods in the appropriate situation and be ready for business communication in any form. <br><br><h2>  <font color="#0071c5">4. Set a strict daily routine.</font> </h2><br>  Treat your work mode as responsibly as possible.  Set the <a href="http://blog.mbaconsult.ru/blog/personal/dzen-rannikh-probuzhdeniy-10-sposobov-zakrepleniya-utrennego-rituala/">beginning of the working day</a> and the time of its end, after which try to strictly follow this schedule.  This will not just help you realize that you work a certain number of hours, but also help you optimize your time.  So, starting to work at 8 am, you know for sure that, let's say, you will work until 5 pm and not be distracted by other things.  If you do not follow this rule, personal and work life can be confused, making it difficult to follow your plans and becoming dangerous for emotional balance. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/6dc/162/47a/6dc16247a839450985bd6080f852dff4.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><h2>  <font color="#0071c5">5. Daily make a list of tasks</font> </h2><br>  Creating a list of tasks that need to be done during the day, you can be not only focused, but also feel the productivity of their efforts.  In general, the daily list of work tasks does not interfere with the office worker, however, when working from home, it is especially important.  Try to prioritize the implementation of each goal, with a specific indication of those cases that must be completed by the end of the day.  In the evening, after completing the work, compare the planned with the completed one.  This will help you evaluate your performance and set new tasks for the next business day. <br><br><h2>  <font color="#0071c5">6. Do not forget about breaks.</font> </h2><br>  Another rule for working at home, no less important than the business style in clothes, are breaks.  They should not be held in the "home office", but, for example, somewhere in the kitchen or in front of the TV.  Such a rest, clearly separating the time and place for work and rest, allows you to relax a bit, clear your mind and continue to work with new forces.  And this is much better than the constant mixing of work and personal life, caused by the complete absence of interruptions or their spontaneity. <br><br><h2>  <font color="#0071c5">7. Avoid constant contact with close people.</font> </h2><br>  This rule requires a very careful approach.  Of course, you should not completely ignore your relatives and friends when they need you.  However, each of them should be explained that, even while at home, you still work.  So, you should be treated as if you are in the office.  Constant distraction on conversations with close people will distract you from the work process. <br><br><h2>  <font color="#0071c5">8. Do not neglect personal communication.</font> </h2><br>  Despite the fact that you work at home, you should not give up the opportunity to personally meet with colleagues or partners.  Meeting in a cafe and visiting the office once or twice a week will improve interaction with people and improve your mental health.  Telephone conversations and even video conferencing will not be able to have such an effect, so do not allow yourself to go exclusively to remote communication. <br><br><h2>  <font color="#0071c5">9. Create habits</font> </h2><br>  Small subroutines that we perform daily can annoy or bore you, but they help to facilitate your work.  <a href="http://blog.mbaconsult.ru/blog/personal/intervyu-s-chalzom-dakhiggom-kak-sila-privychki-mozhet-pomoch-dostich-svoikh-novogodnikh-tseley/">By creating special working habits</a> , you can quickly focus on the work.  For example, the tradition to read e-mail at breakfast every morning and then making plans for the day, following the habit, will automatically give you a working mood.  The same applies to breaks for rest or eating. <br><br><h2>  <font color="#0071c5">10. Encourage yourself for good work.</font> </h2><br>  Good performance deserves a reward.  Feel free to pamper yourself with an extra cup of coffee or a long break, especially if you have done everything on time or even ahead of time.  Such incentives encourage you to continue your work.  In this case, it is the home environment that will give you maximum opportunities for a real holiday compared to a regular office, allowing you to spend extra time in your personal interests after performing an important task. <br><br>  By trying to adhere to all of these recommendations, you will be able to take full advantage of working from home without sacrificing performance and your satisfaction with the work process itself and its results.  If you are just starting to engage in such activities, keep in mind that for each person the rules will work differently.  And it will take you some time to figure out which ones are better for you and which ones are less so.  However, sooner or later, the pursuit of goals will help you create your almost perfect system for work. <br><br>  PS In order to effectively cope with work at home, you need to set yourself goals and priorities.  Pay attention to - <a href="http://blog.mbaconsult.ru/blog/personal/intervyu-s-devidom-allenom/">an interview with David Allen</a> .  In it, he will tell you how easy it is to achieve your goals in the new year. <br><br>  Translated by Vyacheslav Davidenko, founder of <a href="http://www.mbaconsult.ru/">MBA Consult</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/283936/">https://habr.com/ru/post/283936/</a></p>
