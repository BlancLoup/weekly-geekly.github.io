  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Education is a choice</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"><h4>  Introduction </h4><br>  The article ‚Äú <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/149358/">Standard education is a hoax!</a>  ¬ªProvoked heated discussions: about the need for education in general, about the opinion of the author of the article, about the presence of sufficient experience of the author.  After reading the article and comments to it, I realized that I have a rather structured and demonstrative opinion about the problem I want to share. <br><br>  My article will be more general than just reprimand or ascension of the education system, I will touch on the need for education in general, the choice of each life path. <a name="habracut"></a><br><br><h4>  My own experience </h4><br>  I was born in 1989, 5 years before the author of the original article, and, of course, quite young.  I live in the city of Petrozavodsk, graduated from the lyceum (mathematical class), managed to learn in 3 universities (one Moscow, two - Petrozavodsk) and not one of them graduated.  I studied management of organizations, applied mathematics and a teacher of mathematics and computer science at school.  All training was free.

      <br>
      A year and a half ago, I independently decided to leave the academy and do what I want.  Mom was certainly against it.  Now I'm doing music and web development. <br><br>  Proceeding from this, I can tell my thoughts about school and university studies, the work of a teacher, independent life without a diploma. <br><br><h4>  Independent choice </h4><br>  After a comprehensive censure of the education system in the article ‚Äú <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/149358/">Standard education is a hoax!</a>  ¬ªThe author suggests, I quote: <br><br>  <i>‚ÄúTo learn everything that is necessary only for oneself, to go against the flow and not being guided by the opinions of others.</i>  <i>Develop yourself constantly and help others in this, do not be afraid to do what is not expected of you, change your life for the better yourself if you want to be the master of your destiny. ‚Äù</i> <br><br>  This is a great thought of a thinking person.  Indeed, it is wonderful when everyone can make their choice and make it.  But in Russia and Ukraine only 9 classes of school are required.  After studying in 9 classes, everyone is free to manage further education.  There are no legal obstacles for this.  The age of a person has already passed the mark of 14 years, he is free to work with some restrictions, if he does not want to continue his education in any institution.  Already at this stage, with additional knowledge, you can independently earn and build an independent life. <br><br>  In practice, of course, freedom is limited.  The parent's eye is closely watching the future child, and, of course, wishes him well.  That is why parents want the child to continue education while providing parents.  But the majority decides to continue education, even if they are led by their parents.  Often, because it is more convenient and easier, or, realizing how education can help them. <br><br>  After the age of 18, the parents no longer have any rights to manage the child‚Äôs actions, and here decisions about continuing or completing education lie entirely on the student‚Äôs shoulders if he is ready for these decisions. <br><br>  Why is the choice often made in favor of schools, colleges, colleges, universities?  Because of the oppression of the parents?  According to your own desire?  According to the majority?  Because of all this and not only.  Because people are different. <br><br><h4>  What people need or stars from the sky </h4><br>  What is success?  Maybe become a new Steve Jobs?  Or make a billion?  Or climb the career ladder?  Or become an excellent specialist?  Or have a reliable family and a few children?  Or help 100 stray dogs and cats? <br><br>  For each success is different.  Someone will feel the need for continuous self-improvement, someone - in the family happiness, someone - to contribute to a world without wars.  And each has its own way.  A successful person does not need to achieve the highest post, to have the loudest name.  Success can be in the small - in relation to his family, work, home, world. <br><br>  Not everyone wants to learn a lot and do a lot.  It is very important.  Many will arrange a sofa and a TV, if the money for food and housing will be enough.  And this problem is much more acute than the choice between education and self-education.  Because it is associated with the problem of professionalism. <br><br><h4>  Professionalism today </h4><br>  Mixing success and career growth, fame leads to terrible consequences.  Society praises directors and managers, not specialists.  It seems that the company is built only on managers, and not on each employee.  The biggest problem in all areas of work is the lack of specialists.  Professionals in their field. <br><br>  In 25 years, almost all the people around are divided into 3 unequal parts.  People with a diploma who think that a diploma is the only thing required of them;  people without a diploma who are sure that they can do everything, and those who think primarily about their knowledge and skills, and not about the diploma.  Third few, but they are needed most for any job. <br><br>  A specialist in his field is a gold nugget, this man has done serious work in order to achieve professionalism.  And he needs both education and self-education.  Vocational education gives impetus to self-education, sets benchmarks for a short period of time.  Self-education often does not give an opportunity to understand what fundamental knowledge is necessary. <br><br>  And there are few professional school teachers.  This is the first meeting of a schoolboy with non-professionalism: not the best personnel work at school, because there are simply no others, or the working conditions do not suit them.  The best teachers are those who consider it their duty to fruitfully engage in this very matter. <br><br>  The working conditions of the teacher and the teacher are a litmus test of the attitude of the authorities towards the country, the population. <br><br><h4>  Education for the state </h4><br>  Is universal education necessary for the state?  The answer is not easy.  It all depends on government goals. <br><br>  If the sole purpose of power is to maintain its position, then education is an evil for power.  An uneducated person is blind, suggestible, trusting.  Controlling uneducated mass is a simple task. <br><br>  If the state needs the production of complex products, competitiveness and the right to vote on the world stage, then education is the key to success, the key to development. <br><br><h4>  Again about the author </h4><br>  Did the education benefit me personally?  Yes.  I am glad that I studied in all these institutions. <br><br>  School and mother instilled in me a desire to learn, showed what you can do in adult life. <br><br>  Studying in Moscow added me independence. <br><br>  Applied mathematics taught me to think structured, to be able to abstract, which is why I believe that mathematics in school should be mandatory. <br><br>  Studying at the teacher training center showed me how hard and interesting the teacher‚Äôs work is. <br><br><h4>  Eventually </h4><br>  But in the end, everything depends on each individual person; his way is formed by will power, aspirations and desires, his assiduity and outlook. <br><br>  For some, the path of ‚Äú11 classes - higher education institution - postgraduate study‚Äù is the best possible way; for someone, ‚Äú9 classes and free swimming‚Äù is an ideal option.  That is why on Habr√©, among thinking people, there are so many who graduated from high school and are happy about it and those who have not graduated from high school and also this time. <br><br>  Just to understand who you are and what you need, you must learn to make choices and know what to choose from.  And compulsory education should contribute to the formation of these skills, the acquisition of this knowledge. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/149393/">https://habr.com/ru/post/149393/</a></p>
