  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Success tracing</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"><h4>  Lyrics </h4><br>  In economics, there is the concept of cost tracing, if there is one office in which the accounting and marketing department works for the entire company, then you need to include the cost of their content in the cost of each product the company sells, depending on the number of copies of the A and B goods sold, on the price each type of product traces the cost of maintaining the office - this allows you to correctly calculate the costs and prices of goods.  This principle can be turned inside out and used in other areas - as I show below. <br><br><h4>  Use case </h4><br>  Situation number 1. <br>  There are 2 teachers in the school, one educated 10 programmers in olympiads, three of them work abroad for wages above 80 thousand bucks a year, the rest are not less than 10 a year, the second conscientiously wiped 20 pairs of trousers.  Both receive the same salary of about 4 bucks a year.  Something is not right here, somehow not fair. <a name="habracut"></a><br>  Situation number 2 <br>  There are 2 doctors, one really helps people, worries about them - he leads a healthy lifestyle, the second does not even care about his health, not to mention someone else, and is just serving a duty.  They have the same salary. <br><br><h4>  Theory </h4><br>  You can trace the success of students in the salaries of their teachers, doctors - people who helped them to become what they are.  I brought up some unemployed - die from hunger, all the patients scatter from you - in a similar way. <br>  Scheme - we pay a very low income tax - those who are registered as a state of emergency (20% or more, according to the general scheme), different VAT (PDV in Ukraine), which go to unknown places.  At the same time, social connections are not monitored in any way, successful teachers, teachers, doctors are not supported in any way - the only option for them to earn normal money is private practice, tutoring, and so on.  We know little about people who literally ‚Äúput brains in‚Äù for example Zuckerberg, Green and Gates, to whom these people owe their way of thinking at least in part (I do not say that a good teacher is the only reason for the success of these people).  Imagine that 10 people who were helped by the lessons of a single teacher pay taxes not to the state for abstract expenditure items in the budget - and to those teachers whom they deem necessary, they will be chosen by 3 people whom they consider to be obliged, and 10 percent of their income will go to their support This particular month, if a person does not change anything, it will be the same people as in the previous month who would go as taxes - just to the treasury - and so directly to specific people.  The therapist should receive a salary not for hours spent at work - but for the fact that the specific people assigned to him do not get sick.  These 2 articles would be enough for 20% of a citizen's income.  Thus, a teacher who educated 10 olympiadists will receive (80 * 3 + 10 * 7) * 0.1 / 3 = what happens about 10 pieces a year, which is not bad for a teacher-teacher in the CIS, 100% have not seen such teacher salaries for a long time - Moreover, such a remuneration scheme will encourage the very best in their fields to teach and share experiences, these people will be interested in making their lectures interesting and memorable - this will create competition between teachers of different subjects.  You must agree: not every lecture at the university was like a show - but there are teachers with whom monuments should be given during life, and not just a normal salary.  Specifically, in my university, in graduate school, kisorytya is almost the most hopeless, with some exceptions.  In order for such a scheme to work successfully, it is also necessary to simplify the ‚Äúentry into the educational market‚Äù so that ‚Äúprofessional‚Äù teachers and teachers feel competition from practicing experts and have an incentive to master new technologies.  Otherwise, the development of education is impossible.  For this, in turn, a certain freedom of the teacher and the institution of higher education from various programs and the Ministry of Education is necessary.  To do this, you can apply the same principle of tracing success - the university where the teacher currently works receives a small part of the funds traced to the teacher - thus the universities will be interested in attracting the best teachers, and the teacher with a salary of more than 800 bucks a month - this is already a more mobile person, which can, if necessary, move to another city for example. <br>  Ideally, this scheme should be similar to a neural network in which active neurons send impulses along synapses, and neurons on the other side of the most intensive connections are activated - and send impulses further, that is, teachers of a young talented graduate student, and a doctor who helps an elderly, distinguished professor not to fall into insanity.  With the current scheme of the education system, the latter simply will not have money for treatment if necessary.

    <h4>  Problems </h4><br>  There is an obvious problem in this scheme - people working abroad will pay taxes there, this is one thing, it could be smoothed out if we had a culture of support for our teachers ... And this ‚Äúhyperately‚Äù should motivate the state to somehow keep brains do tax breaks for technology companies. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/108695/">https://habr.com/ru/post/108695/</a></p>
