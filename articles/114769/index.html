By evening, he had already been asked to return, but in principle, I can already tell you something.  Samsung made a cool modern gadget that has it all: a trendy dual-core processor, and a hefty screen made using Super AMOLED Plus technology and all possible data transfer standards, including Wi-Fi IEEE 802.11n, Bluetooth 3.0 and NFC.  And all this joy weighs 116 grams of funny, and the battery is quite decent, given the type of display.  But for some reason it does not cling to me - that's all.  Maybe I did not have time to make friends with him for an incomplete day of rapid testing, maybe something else, but I got the impression that I had already seen all this somewhere.  And I'm not even hinting at the iPhone 4, which the Galaxy S II looks like quite a bit, and in general no specific product, I rather mean that Samsung has turned out a sort of collective image of a high-quality communicator.  But behind the desire to make the right smart developers on all sides, in my opinion, they missed something important that I personally would have made to go to the store and buy it. <a name="habracut"></a><br><br><h4>  Appearance </h4><br>  This is perhaps the biggest smartphone I have in my hands.  But at the same time and the easiest.  Cognitive dissonance, and that's it!  You expect to take a weighty bar in your hand, in which modern technologies stick out of all the cracks, but in fact you get the impression that they want to deceive you: in childhood they sometimes played with each other, carefully folding the candy wrapper back :)

The ultrathin case adds 8 8,4 mm to the fire.  So for the first few hours I tried very hard not to drop it, but in the end I got used to it. <br><br><h4>  Display </h4><br>  Super AMOLED Plus is more like marketing than any real improvement.  Seriously!  Did not notice any fundamental differences from the usual Super AMOLED.  Everything is as bright, contrasting, and with viewing angles everything is fine.  Well, with power consumption, of course, about which a little lower. <br><br><h4>  Filling </h4><br>  On the performance of the dual-core gigahertz Samsung Orion in combination with 1 GB of RAM, it is still difficult to say something definite.  The firmware is still oh, which is not final, and at times unimaginable jambs and brakes come out.  I think that the result obtained in the Quadrant Standart - 2239 points - is not yet taken too seriously.  However, this is already very close to the NVIDIA Tegra 2, installed in the LG Optimus 2x. <br><br><h4>  Soft </h4><br>  Android version 2.3 is installed on this Galaxy with TouchWiz 4.0 enhancer.  (Shortly after they hit the market, they promise to upgrade to 2.4).  Externally, the differences have not yet been found, except for one of the desktops on which were four shortcuts: Game Hub, Music Hub, Readers Hub and Social Hub.  Only music and social were launched from them, but in principle everything is clear: the first three are, in fact, specialized content stores, and the last are taped from social networks.  Vkontaktikov and other classmates yet, and whether it is - it is not clear. <br><br><h4>  Working hours </h4><br>  Here everything rests on the screen.  AMOLED, as you know, doesn‚Äôt have a lot of pipes, so the gadget was able to work for me ten hours in <i>active</i> testing mode.  And this is despite the fact that when they gave it to me, it was charged at 90 percent. Normally, I think. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/e60/7d4/c18/e607d4c1879212d2ff3feacf88c2b65f.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  If something else is done to optimize the work of the two cores, then there will be beauty in general. <br><br><h4>  Summary </h4><br>  While there are rumors on the Web that the Galaxy S II will cost 33,000 rubles.  Expensive, of course, but in principle it is worth it - the one who buys this device, I think, will not regret it.  Another thing is that I personally would hardly have bought it, and the most interesting thing is that I can not clearly explain why!  I understand with my mind that the device is cool from all sides, but for some reason it does not‚Ä¶ <br><br><h4>  In life </h4><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/zlsZo2qb40E%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700023,15700186,15700190,15700253,15700256,15700259&amp;usg=ALkJrhg6zMxwzYhqQl_RU1HVbfPwXj6dfg" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br>  <i>For those who are interested in the dynamics to see how the gadget is in the hand, we made a short video review.</i> <br><br><h4>  TTX </h4><br>  <b>OS:</b> Google Android 2.3 (plan to upgrade to 2.4) <br>  <b>Processor:</b> Samsung Orion, 1 GHz <br>  <b>Screen:</b> Super AMOLED Plus, 4.3 ", 16 million colors, 800x480, capacitive <br>  <b>RAM:</b> 1 GB <br>  <b>Built-in memory:</b> 16 GB + microSDHC <br>  <b>Communications:</b> 3G, Wi-Fi b / g / n, Bluetooth 3.0, NFC, USB <br>  <b>Connectors:</b> micro USB, 3.5mm <br>  <b>Camera:</b> 8 megapixels.  + 2 megapixels. <br>  <b>Navigation:</b> GPS, A-GPS <br>  <b>Battery:</b> 1500 mAh <br>  <b>Dimensions:</b> 125.3 x 66.1 x 8.49 mm <br>  <b>Weight:</b> 116 g </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/114769/">https://habr.com/ru/post/114769/</a></p>
