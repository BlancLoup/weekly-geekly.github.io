I read your articles for quite a long time and learned a lot from them, thank you for that. <br><br>  As you know, just recently the world lost a great man - Steve Jobs.  Yes, it was hard to believe in it ... He made the world better and how much more he could have done for us.  I want to share with you my thoughts and tell you how Steve Jobs changed my life - about the principles he adhered to and thanks to whom he achieved such success. <br><br>  Following these principles, your life will acquire a new meaning.  Such a life will charge you with energy, and every day you will begin to make the world a better place, as Steve Jobs did: ‚ÄúWe are here to contribute to this world.  Otherwise, why are we here? ‚Äù <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  <b>1. Do not waste time</b>

      <br>
      Think about what you spend every minute of every day? <br><br>  On watching TV, lying on the couch?  Sit in the office 8 hours a day, taking your time doing work that you don‚Äôt like? <br><br>  After all, we have so little time.  Let's calculate: in Russia, an average person lives 70 years - this is 3640 weeks.  If we subtract the time we spend on sleep (‚Öì of our life), as well as the first few years of childhood, which we don‚Äôt really remember, it remains less than 2000 weeks.  And what can we say about 70 years, few people live so much in our time. <br><br>  Steve Jobs gives us some good advice on his personal example: <br>  ‚ÄúFor the last 33 years, I looked in the mirror every morning and asked myself: If today is the last day in my life, will I do what I have planned for today?‚Äù [A <i>speech to Stanford graduates, 2005</i> ] <br><br>  "Remember that I will die soon is a great tool that helped me make all the most important decisions in my life."  [ <i>Speech to Stanford Alumni, 2005</i> ] <br><br>  And how is your day going?  Start appreciating time and you will leave a mark on the universe. <br><br>  <b>2. Find a purpose and exalt it.</b> <br><br>  ‚ÄúOnly having a goal brings life meaning and satisfaction.  This contributes not only to improved health and longevity, but also gives you a bit of optimism in difficult times. ‚Äù <br><br>  Do you have a purpose in life, with the thought of which you happily wake up in the morning? <br><br>  Many people will answer - "Of course, I want more money!".  But think about it, do you really want it?  For what? <br><br>  As Steve Jobs said: "I do not want to be the richest man in the cemetery." <br><br>  And here many may answer: ‚ÄúMoney is needed to improve the quality of life of my family.  Make them happier. ‚Äù <br><br>  There is already some meaning here.  We all want to be happy and, giving happiness to loved ones, we become even happier.  But then we can make other people happier, even those we don‚Äôt know. <br><br>  For example, you work as a sales assistant in a grocery store.  The goal should not be to sell the goods to the buyer, which is more expensive, and get from this a large premium.  Work for the buyer, help him find what he wants, advise him the best product possible, smile and give a positive.  People will be grateful to you, and you yourself will become even happier.  You will love your job. <br><br>  And so in almost any business - do it with a good purpose, help people, improve the world, and life will find meaning. <br><br>  ‚ÄúWe eat food that other people grow.  We wear clothes that other people sewed.  We speak languages ‚Äã‚Äãthat were invented by other people.  I think the time has come for us to become useful to humanity. ‚Äù <br><br>  To serve people is the highest goal of life. <br><br>  <b>3. Follow your heart and believe in yourself.</b> <br><br>  ‚ÄúThere is only one way to do a great job - to love it.  If you do not come to this, wait.  Don't rush into action. ‚Äù <br><br>  Be sure to listen to your heart and your conscience, they will never deceive you and offer the best option.  If an event occurs that affects us, emotions are instantly born, and only then the mind turns on.  And this is no accident: listen to these emotions - they give us very valuable information. <br><br>  If at the thought of doing something, you have a fire inside that makes your eyes shine, and you feel an uplift, then you should deal with it.  Mind can tell you the opposite - ‚Äúwhy do I need this ?!  little is paid for this work, ‚Äùor, even worse,‚Äú it is impossible, I will fail, ‚Äùbut do not listen to it.  Take the first step, if you feel an even greater rise, do not stop. <br><br>  ‚ÄúDo what you love.  Look for an activity that will give you a sense of sense, purposefulness and satisfaction with life.  Having a goal and striving for its realization brings orderliness to life, ‚Äùadvises Steve Jobs. <br><br>  ‚ÄúYour time is limited, do not waste it, living a different life.  Don't get hooked on creeds that exist on other people's thinking.  Do not let the looks of others muffle your own inner voice.  And it is very important to have the courage to follow your heart and intuition.  They, anyway, already know what you really want to do.  All the rest is secondary. ‚Äù <br><br>  Believe in yourself, nothing is impossible for you.  Probably, there is such a law: if a very interesting idea has arisen in my head that no one has yet implemented, almost everyone around will look at you as a madman and say to you: "This is impossible, give up this venture."  Close your ears and get down to business.  Your only counselor is your heart.  Believe him, and you will surely succeed. <br><br>  <b>4. Do not be afraid to make mistakes</b> <br><br>  Mistakes are an important part of our life journey.  Without making mistakes, you cannot move forward, as if one mistake is one step of a child learning to walk.  And with each such step you acquire the necessary skills and abilities, form your personality, temper it.  Learn to walk, otherwise your goal will remain somewhere far away. <br><br>  Steve Jobs really knew the benefits of our mistakes: ‚ÄúI am one of the few people who know what it is to lose a quarter of a billion dollars in a year.  It forms personality very well. ‚Äù <br><br>  ‚ÄúThere is no such thing as a successful person who has never stumbled and did not make mistakes - there are only successful people who made mistakes, but then changed their lives and their plans based on these very mistakes made before (henceforth ).  They consider mistakes as a lesson from which they derive valuable experience.  To prevent mistakes is to do nothing. ‚Äù <br><br>  <b>5. Think creative, be creative.</b> <br><br>  As Hugh MacLeod said: ‚ÄúEveryone was born a creative person.  In kindergarten, everyone was given a box of pencils. ‚Äù  Why do many people forget about such an important and necessary quality?  If you forgot about him too, it's time to revive him in yourself.  Develop creative thinking, as a creative and unique solution to the problem makes life more interesting. <br><br>  ‚ÄúCreativity is simply the creation of connections between things.  When creative people are asked how they did something, they feel a little guilty, because they didn‚Äôt really do anything, they just noticed.  This becomes clear to them over time.  They were able to link different pieces of their experience and synthesize something new.  This is because they have experienced and seen more than others, or because they reflect more on this. ‚Äù <br><br>  <b>6. Stay humble</b> <br><br>  Do not try to stand out from the crowd, do not seek fame - only in this way can you preserve yourself and the integrity of your personality.  Do not waste your energy on meaningless. <br><br>  ‚ÄúLooking back, I can say that my dismissal from Apple was the best event in my life.  I got rid of the burden of a successful person and regained the ease and doubts of a novice.  It freed me and marked the beginning of my most creative period. ‚Äù[A <i>speech to Stanford graduates, 2005</i> ] <br><br>  ‚ÄúStay hungry, stay foolish.‚Äù [ <i>Speech to Stanford graduates, 2005</i> ] <br><br>  <b>7. Live the present</b> <br><br>  Do not look back, especially to adversity and disappointment.  Do not rush to meet the future.  Live in a state of "here and now" (state of flow) and at the same time go to your goal, then you will certainly know what it means to be a successful and happy person. <br><br>  ‚ÄúLive the life that you choose and where you yourself are the master of your destiny,‚Äù Steve Jobs, the man who changed the world. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/131255/">https://habr.com/ru/post/131255/</a></p>
