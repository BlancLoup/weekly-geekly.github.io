  <section class="page js-page"><h1>SOS-1. Cellular security alarm</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"> Inspired by the article <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/147164/">‚ÄúRemote RESET computer using a mobile phone‚Äù</a> <br><br>  Around 2004, a task appeared - to make a security device transmitting information on penetration to an object to a cell phone. <br>  It was interesting to make the device so that the ‚ÄúCellular Security Alarm‚Äù did not spend money on its work. <br>  In those days, the most popular and affordable phones were brand ‚ÄúSiemens‚Äù. <br>  One of the big problems that has surfaced in the development of such devices, both of this SOS model and the next, more perfect, is that quite a long time passes from the moment the idea arises to its realization.  As a result, the model used disappears from the shelves and getting it to repeat becomes a problem.  Therefore, piece products are obtained.  In our time, the release of phones by this manufacturer has stopped completely. <br><br>  The main in the development of any device is the study of the idea in my head.  The product must first earn in the brain, and only then materialize in the stone.  On how well everything is thought out in advance and depends on further work. <br>  The main idea of ‚Äã‚Äãcreating the SOS-1 was the free operation of the device, so the whole algorithm of work was aimed at the implementation of this idea. <br>  The eight-leg PIC12F629 was used as a manager.

      Photo of the upgraded keyboard. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/071/481/228/0714812280d0aad54a88317e7d913a4d.jpg" alt="image"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  <b>Purpose</b> <br>  Cellular security alarm (hereinafter referred to as SOS) is designed to send a message on the alarm system‚Äôs alarm to the host‚Äôs phone, to listen to the sound situation in the protected room, as well as to activate any load: siren, lamp, tape recorder, etc. <br><br>  The transmission of information about the alarm triggering, switching on the load and testing the system‚Äôs performance are performed without the host picking up the handset, i.e., free of charge both for the COC phone and the host phone. <br>  Listening to the premises is carried out with the telephone ‚Äúpicking up‚Äù the SOS phone - for him this call will be incoming, that is, free. <br>  Payment for listening is made by the owner - for him it is an outgoing call and the cost is proportional to the listening time. <br><br>  <b>Specifications.</b> <br>  Connectable phone ... Siemens A50; <br>  Power supply: network ... 220V; <br>  battery cell phone Siemens A50 ... 2.2 ... 3.6V; <br>  The battery life when the mains voltage is lost ... up to 4 days; <br>  Voltage from the security alarm sensor ... 12V; <br>  Switching device load power ... up to 200 W; <br>  Operating temperature range ... + 5 ... +40 degrees C. <br><br>  <b>Principle of operation.</b> <br>  After arming the SOS on the security mode, the system constantly checks the status of the alarm sensor and waits for the owner to ring. <br><br>  When an alarm sensor is triggered, the SOS leaves the security mode and dials the phone number dialed on the SOS last. <br>  It is necessary that the dialing phone has caller ID.  If in 25 seconds dialing did not work, the SOS will redial the number. <br>  If the cellular network malfunctions or as a result of disconnecting the host‚Äôs phone, the SOS will not be able to reach you, so in order to save battery power, it increases the intervals between dialing: after 5 minutes to 1 minute, after 15 minutes to 5 minutes, after an hour to 30 minutes. <br>  If the connection is restored in the interval between dialing and the host at that moment called to check the functionality, the SOS will ‚Äúreset‚Äù the call and begin dialing attempts first. <br><br>  After dialing (the owner received a signal that the alarm was triggered - the phone number), the COS waits for a confirmation call for a minute. <br>  If he does not arrive, SOS will continue to try to call.  The host makes a confirmation call after the COC finishes the connection. <br><br>  If the confirming call of the host lasts up to 5 seconds (one beep), this confirms that the host is aware of the alarm.  After this call, the SOS will exit the security mode and re-arm (security alarm sensor polling) automatically after 10 minutes or 3 hours (at the request of the customer). <br>  If the call is longer than 5 seconds (more than one beep), the SOS will also pick up the receiver to listen to the sound situation. <br>  In order for the SOS to hold the handset up, it is necessary to press any number key at least once every 10 seconds.  10 seconds after the last pressing of the SOS key, "hang up" the handset. <br>  If while listening to the sound situation, a burglar alarm sensor triggered, the SOS ‚Äúhangs up‚Äù the phone and calls the owner back as if the alarm was triggered. <br><br>  If the host wishes to check the communication channel and the SOS operability, he makes a short call (one beep) to the SOS phone number. <br>  In response to this request SOS calls back to the owner.  Attempt to reach up to 5 minutes. <br><br>  If it is necessary to turn on the load on the protected object, the owner makes a short call to the COC.  In response, the COC calls back to the host, as in the performance test.  To enable the load, the host must call back again within 30 seconds after the COS disconnects the call. <br>  In this case, if the last call of the host lasts less than 5 seconds, the SOS will turn on the load for 1 minute 40 seconds.  If the call lasts more than 5 seconds, then the tube will also be lifted to listen to the sound situation. <br>  It is also possible to switch on the load when an alarm is triggered, if the owner makes a second call within 30 seconds after his confirmation call. <br><br>  <b>Installation</b> <br>  Installation of SOS is made in a place protected from quick access.  It is necessary that in this place there was a steady reception of a signal. <br>  The SOS phone dials the host and includes a filter to this number (menu-audio-filtering call-group, for example, office), and the owner‚Äôs number must be in this group (phone-group book, for example, office).  Now calls to SOS will pass only from the owner. <br>  When the battery is disconnected, information about the filter and the last dialer is not saved, so it is necessary after the installation of the battery to repeat the dialer process and install the filter! <br>  Ring tone can be selected as recurring (menu ‚Äî audio ring melodies ‚Äî group calls ‚Äî group, for example, office ‚Äî 16). <br>  The volume of the ring signal is set to the minimum so as not to give out the location of the SOS when making calls. <br>  The device is turned on by connecting the SOS to the phone with a connecting cable and to the ‚ÄúSiren‚Äù output of the alarm system. <br>  The cell phone charger is in the SOS package, so it is necessary to turn on the device in the 220V network, regardless of whether the load is switched on or not. <br>  It is advisable not to beat off the call signals of the SOS, since the dialing analysis is performed by the presence of a long beep, and this takes about 5 ... 10 seconds. <br><br>  The disadvantages inherent in this model SOS - one owner, the modernization of the phone, the lack of SMS to control the device ... were taken into account when developing the next model.  But more about that another time. <br><br>  <b>Documentation.</b> <br>  <a href="https://docs.google.com/open%3Fid%3D0B38yPPb71lGRVDI2SjktZlJseEU">Description.</a> <br>  <a href="https://docs.google.com/open%3Fid%3D0B38yPPb71lGRblJYM2Z2eEFrWVU">Electrical circuit and connection.</a> <br>  <a href="https://docs.google.com/open%3Fid%3D0B38yPPb71lGRT016dFJfWXZBVTA">Printed circuit board.</a> <br>  <a href="https://docs.google.com/open%3Fid%3D0B38yPPb71lGRb1dYbzVnZHVoeGc">Waveforms.</a> <br>  <a href="https://docs.google.com/open%3Fid%3D0B38yPPb71lGRZm1oRmlHMmdBams">Description of the phone connector.</a> <br>  <a href="https://docs.google.com/open%3Fid%3D0B38yPPb71lGRblRMZGh4d2ZKalU">Keyboard layout and its refinement.</a> <br>  <a href="https://docs.google.com/open%3Fid%3D0B38yPPb71lGRa2c2UjNENTVINm8">The block diagram of the device.</a> <br>  <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1C7AyRzLS5FsgC1RBF9omFlCFb4EnGzVmmxarAwWzNtc/edit">Program of work.</a> <br><br>  <b>Addition to the article.</b> <br>  The comments asked an interesting <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/147173/">question from nooze July 5, 2012 at 12:52</a> <br>  <i>... tell first of all about how you ‚Äúhave come to this‚Äù :) Why was the phone chosen, what functions did it manage to use and why is it good and that is bad.</i>  <i>What happened is not.</i> <i><br></i>  <i>In general, rather the history of development and not a description of the already finished device.</i> <br><br>  I answer. <br>  How come this ... <br>  Needed was an informant who reports the alarm at the facility.  Then the soul of the owner of the object becomes much calmer. <br>  In those years, the connection of the object to the private security service (other structures simply did not exist) was very expensive, and in the absence of a wired telephone it was not made at all.  It is now available all types of services and money, in a competitive environment, they have become more accessible. <br>  In practice, of course, there are also many different subtleties, for example: what to do in the event of an alarm? <br>  Here everyone decides in his own way - call the neighbors, call the police / police, visit the object, if not far away. <br>  Telephone calls then cost a little expensive and the task was to reduce these losses to a minimum, by transmitting information only to calls without lifting the handset. <br>  Just in those years, due to the high cost, various bridges between cellular and wire communications began to appear. <br><br>  About the choice between a modem and a telephone. <br>  <i>Modem.</i> <br>  - The cost is higher than on the phone and you need to buy it somewhere. <br>  - Requires purchase of battery and power supply. <br>  - Requires a computer to configure.  I didn‚Äôt have a portable computer then (and even now), but I don‚Äôt want to take it to a stationary to clarify the circumstances or settings. <br>  - It is believed that the modem is more reliable.  But the practice of many years of work has shown that the phone has coped very well with the work.  Yes, and reading many forums have shown that modems are not quite perfect. <br>  <i>Phone:</i> <br>  - The temperature conditions in the room allow you to use the phone. <br>  - Possesses the screen and you can make all the settings on the spot and very quickly. <br>  - It is worth little money and it was already available. <br>  - It is necessary only once every six months to make a call from the SOS phone so that the operator does not disconnect the telephone number, which has not paid him for a long time. <br><br>  The disadvantages were written above, they were corrected in the next model of SOS. <br><br>  The result is a device that has successfully worked for many years. <br>  The algorithm of work turned out to be successful and in the next device remained almost the same, but added work with SMS for those who want to spend money on them. <br>  The following model was also implemented: <br>  - several hosts; <br>  - two outputs for load management; <br>  - work with sensors without using external alarm; <br>  - LED indication of the device operation mode; <br>  - failure of the built-in battery and the use of a more powerful external with an automatic charger. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/147173/">https://habr.com/ru/post/147173/</a></p>
