Behind the first half of January, and thus the New Year holidays, and CES 2017. This year, many device manufacturers have participated in the famous exhibition, and Xiaomi, which for obvious reasons deserves our special attention, was no exception.  But it all happened so fast (why, Vegas is Las Vegas!), And you probably missed something.  Therefore, we decided to put all the new items together and find out what really deserves attention and what can be missed. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/d26/4ac/ebb/d264acebba470da5faf110031a5b1d2a.jpg"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Although Xiaomi was founded in 2010, however, until this year, it had not yet held its press conferences at CES.  This time, the Chinese giant decided to take part in the event, and, as is typical of him, on a grand scale, presenting several new products at once. <br><br>  Naturally, we also did not forget about CES, and even <a href="http://www.gearbest.com/promotion-ces-promo-special-1128.html%3Futm_source%3Dgeektimes%26utm_medium%3Dyulia%26utm_campaign%3Dg17">dedicated a special sale</a> to it, you can buy dozens of products at tasty prices - from quadcopters and virtual reality helmets to laptops, routers and headphones.  The exhibition is over, and the sale continues!

    <h2>  Another reason to buy Xiaomi Mi Mix </h2><br>  Let's start with not the most significant, but still interesting for many buyers - the long-awaited Xiaomi Mi Mix in white color debuted at CES 2017.  His black counterpart, which, by the way, can be <a href="http://www.gearbest.com/cell-phones/pp_502620.html%3Futm_source%3Dgeektimes%26utm_medium%3Dyulia%26utm_campaign%3Dg17">bought now</a> , was introduced last fall and immediately <a href="https://geektimes.ru/company/gearbest/blog/282114/">attracted attention</a> - still, not all manufacturers (for example, Sharp) are now trying to experiment with frameless devices.  White Mi Mix has completely inherited the features of the black model - the ceramic case, the huge screen almost the entire front panel, and looks no less stylish. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/e06/1a2/98c/e061a298c9a12e86823a272728a08a0b.jpg"><br><br>  The screen size of the Mi Mix is ‚Äã‚Äã6.4 inches, while the top and side frames, despite all the assurances of marketers, it still has, albeit very thin.  Anyway, the screen occupies more than 90% of the front panel: as a result, the proximity sensor was replaced with ultrasonic technology, and the speaker with a special piezoelectric speaker system.  Tiny by modern standards, the front camera (5 megapixels, by the way) is located under the screen, and the fingerprint scanner is on the back panel.  The rear camera is 16 megapixel, has a dual LED flash and phase autofocus. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/565/285/c56/565285c566f8323655ad3736c9c5bd6d.jpg"><br><br>  The Mi Mix display has a resolution of 2040 x 1080 pixels, a Qualcomm Snapdragon 821 is used as a processor in the smartphone, versions with 4 GB and 6 GB of RAM and 128 GB or 256 GB of internal flash memory are available to choose from.  The device boasts a 4400 mAh battery and support for Quick Charge 3.0. <br><br>  In general, the smartphone is interesting in every sense.  Sales of Mi Mix in white should begin in the first half of 2017. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/106/e8d/12d/106e8d12d16af2dae6fbe473947f5102.jpg"><br><br><h2>  Mi Router HD - now you don't need a NAS? </h2><br>  Xiaomi decided not to leave without an update and Mi WiFi Router 2 - in fact, it is its improved version that is Mi Router HD.  A four-antenna MIMO router with a black anodized aluminum case and a built-in 1 TB or 8 TB hard drive looks like a real beast. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/810/254/07a/81025407ad9dd95f2eec3a743c72553c.jpg"><br><br>  Yes, and inside is not "angel."  Powerful antennas with high signal range and maximum transmission speeds up to 2600 Mbps.  The router allows you to set up automatic backup from connected devices (not only a computer, but also a phone), has support for cloud services, Sonos audio systems and even Time Machine - a nice bonus for owners of Mac computers.  The device works with the help of the Qualcomm IPQ8064 processor. <br><br>  The new router from Xiaomi will be available in the first quarter of this year at a price ranging from $ 200 to $ 500.  If you don‚Äôt want to wait that long, you can look in the direction of <a href="http://www.gearbest.com/wireless-routers/pp_497233.html%3Futm_source%3Dgeektimes%26utm_medium%3Dyulia%26utm_campaign%3Dg17">Mi Wifi Router 3</a> - also four powerful antennas, but without the built-in storage (if you already played enough with the NAS). <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/0fa/a19/5ec/0faa195ec5d050098d6b66cf1221b257.jpg"></div><br><h2>  Yi 4K +: if the action, then only 60 FPS </h2><br>  Once again, the rumors were true - the Yi 4K + camera still saw the light at the last exhibition of electronic devices.  Xiaomi, of course, has already spoiled us with high-resolution shooting in Yi 4K, but the model with the ‚Äúplus‚Äù has an advantage over its predecessor, and serious one - shooting 4K at 60 frames per second.  The Chinese manufacturer was one of the first to introduce a device of this type with this functionality. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/ee8/c26/d85/ee8c26d857da5ccc5a0fda46039f9292.jpg"><br><br>  At the same time, it is still an action camera, and now it will easily give a light to GoPro itself.  The Yi 4K + has a 2.19-inch display, the newest Ambarella H2 processor (four cores, 1.2 GHz, built on 14nm process technology), the maximum bitrate is up to 120 Mbps, while the GoPro Hero 5 boasts a bitrate of 60 Mbps and the old Ambarella A9SE processor. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/4f3/622/d61/4f3622d6119b8dca53c44bb06abe5d54.jpg"><br>  The sensor used here is the Sony IMX377 sensor, which is familiar to many.  The battery capacity is 1400 mAh, support for microSD memory cards up to 128 GB.  The novelty is charged using the USB-C connector, it can also be adapted to connect a microphone. <br><br>  In the network, by the way, videos have already appeared with examples of shooting in 4K and 60 FPS, made on a new 4K + camera.  The device has a built-in 3D electronic image stabilization, which makes the picture even smoother.  The very feeling when it seems that this live can be worse than on the monitor screen. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/a1D6xizxLXg" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  When will it be available, you ask?  Representatives of Yi have kept silent about this, but you can <a href="http://www.gearbest.com/action-cameras/pp_606452.html%3Futm_source%3Dgeektimes%26utm_medium%3Dyulia%26utm_campaign%3Dg17">subscribe to updates</a> and find out about it one of the first.  Expected price - around $ 500.  If you are looking for something cheaper, <a href="http://www.gearbest.com/action-cameras/pp_360138.html%3Futm_source%3Dgeektimes%26utm_medium%3Dyulia%26utm_campaign%3Dg17">pay attention to the Y2</a> : it also shoots at 4K (albeit at 30 FPS), has a wide viewing angle of 155 degrees, a 2.19-inch LCD display and a 1400 mAh battery. <br><br><h2>  Mi Note 2 played with new colors </h2><br>  Yes, not only Mi Mix touched color changes from the Xiaomi design team.  The manufacturer decided to expand the color palette and for its flagship Mi Note 2, offering it in green, purple and pink (sorry) color. <br><br>  The green version strongly reminded the Green Emerald of the Samsung Galaxy S6 Edge. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/cbe/5ca/c42/cbe5cac42d955cf31f5068b2d34a129e.jpg"></div><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/529/9b1/f74/5299b1f74beeb9dab754f156637c2beb.jpg"></div><br>  And here is the pink peeping (photos were taken ‚Äúon the knee‚Äù from the stand, so we apologize for the quality in advance). <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/587/c29/025/587c290254bed4ce1304df70ff864fd9.jpg"><br><br>  The specifications of the smartphone have remained unchanged - no, not even the cores and the RAM have been added.  However, more is not necessary - on board the Mi Note 2 is the same quad Snapdragon 821 with a frequency of 2.35 GHz, 4 GB or 6 GB of RAM to choose from and 64 GB / 128 GB of internal memory UFS 2.0.  All of this is packaged in a case and a 5.7-inch curved OLED display with a resolution of 1920 x 1080 pixels, protected by Corning Gorilla Glass. <br><br>  The rear camera of the smartphone is 22.56 megapixels, the Sony IMX 318 Exmor R is used as a sensor. The device is also equipped with electronic image stabilization, phase autofocus and LED flash.  The 8 megapixel front camera also has auto focus. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/25b/ae9/fdf/25bae9fdfe7e7c001e6ff3aa6c9905aa.jpg"><br><br>  The device is running Android 6.0 with MIUI 8 shell, has a USB Type-C connector, a 4070 mAh battery and an ultrasonic fingerprint scanner.  When Mi Note 2 in new colors will be on sale is still unknown: Hugo Barra subtly hinted that smartphones can only be destined for the Chinese market (however, who has ever stopped it).  If suddenly new colors are not impressed, there is always a win-win black classic - and stylish, and <a href="http://www.gearbest.com/cell-phones/pp_502841.html%3Futm_source%3Dgeektimes%26utm_medium%3Dyulia%26utm_campaign%3Dg17">already in stock</a> . <br><br>  Since we started talking about Xiaomi smartphones, here we have very attractive promotions on Redmi 4 4G.  For $ 145.99, <a href="http://www.gearbest.com/cell-phones/pp_607219.html%3Futm_source%3Dgeektimes%26utm_medium%3Dyulia%26utm_campaign%3Dg17">you can buy a</a> smartphone with 3 GB of RAM, 32 GB of internal memory, a Full HD display and a fingerprint scanner (the main thing is to remember to use the <b>XIAMIG</b> coupon).  The coupon <b>REMI4</b> gives a good discount on the version with 2 GB of RAM <a href="http://www.gearbest.com/cell-phones/pp_602062.html%3Futm_source%3Dgeektimes%26utm_medium%3Dyulia%26utm_campaign%3Dg17">in white</a> .  And if you enter the <b>M3SGB</b> when ordering <a href="http://www.gearbest.com/cell-phones/pp_397207.html%3Futm_source%3Dgeektimes%26utm_medium%3Dyulia%26utm_campaign%3Dg17">Meizu M3S 4G</a> , you can snatch it for $ 129.99. <br><br><h2>  Mi TV 4 - what was it all about? </h2><br>  Xiaomi, it seems, is very fascinated by the ‚Äúframelessness‚Äù - the company introduced a new representative of its line of smart TVs - Mi TV 4. The thickness of the new product is incredibly small - only 4.9 mm, and the frames around the screen are so thin that it seems that they don‚Äôt exist at all. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/64e/f04/6ed/64ef046edbc1ecd3a5fac5d4404c4eaa.jpg"><br><br>  What is the secret?  No, nothing supernatural - just resourceful Chinese took and put all the main TV hardware into a separate soundbar.  And what, the last many people buy separately, why not combine business with pleasure?  Moreover, the approach was already run-in on Mi TV 3, and customers liked it. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/23c/117/4c2/23c1174c2bd7b2551ccdd574834a820b.jpg"></div><br>  Unfortunately, the lower part of the TV turned out to be slightly thicker than 4.9 mm, otherwise it would be inconvenient to mount it to the wall.  To the soundbar, which provides high-quality sound using ten built-in speakers, the Mi TV 4 connects using the Mi Port connector: the soundbar itself has three HDMI ports, 2 USB ports, Ethernet, audio system connectors (Xiaomi offers for an additional $ 500), RJ45 and , of course, a connector for the antenna. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/4fd/43c/31f/4fd43c31f880879ee7332931733f7069.jpg"><br><br>  The TV is running Android, but it has special software Xiaomi Patch Wall.  It works on the principle of machine learning - it analyzes which channels and series the user watches, and she herself draws up a list of recommended programs.  You no longer have to scroll through a few dozen channels from cable in search of something interesting. <br><br>  The manufacturer plans to sell the TV in several versions - with a screen diagonal of 49 inches, 55 inches and 65 inches.  The older version in the Chinese market will cost $ 1,500, as the younger ones will not cost.  Xiaomi noted that the novelty is intended only for the domestic market.  A similar soundbar Mi TV Bar, by the way, you can <a href="http://www.gearbest.com/tv-box-mini-pc/pp_597313.html%3Futm_source%3Dgeektimes%26utm_medium%3Dyulia%26utm_campaign%3Dg17">buy now</a> . <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/f6a/995/b08/f6a995b0859bea08c2120f1fb222491c.jpg"><br><br><h2>  The first pancake is not lumpy </h2><br>  Frankly, for the first time is very good.  Xiaomi once again reminded of itself to the world community and competitors and showed that there is not just gunpowder in the old dog stoves, but it is very, very much.  Now we are looking forward to see how the company will surprise us at the upcoming MWC in Barcelona. <br><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Bonus for those who read to the end</b> <div class="spoiler_text">  <a href="http://www.gearbest.com/promotion-lenovo-moto-z-special-1134.html%3Futm_source%3Dgeektimes%26utm_medium%3Dyulia%26utm_campaign%3Dg17">Discounts for Lenovo Moto Z, Moto Z Play and more.</a> <br><br>  <a href="http://www.gearbest.com/promotion-ultimate-tablets-special-996.html%3Futm_source%3Dgeektimes%26utm_medium%3Dyulia%26utm_campaign%3Dg17">Sale tablet with cool discounts</a> <br><br>  <a href="http://www.gearbest.com/promotion-jumper-sales-special-1135.html%3Futm_source%3Dgeektimes%26utm_medium%3Dyulia%26utm_campaign%3Dg17">EZpad 6 for only $ 154.99</a> </div></div></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/400627/">https://habr.com/ru/post/400627/</a></p>
