  <section class="page js-page"><h1>How have career ladders and elevators changed in the IT industry over the past week?</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Drawing attention to how quickly changes can occur in the career of IT specialists, the self-critical observer will ask himself a question: maybe I missed something?  In one week alone, departments, divisions and even entire companies may cease to exist.  In one week, a specialist can get an offer that will allow him to step over two steps of a career ladder, and an unknown student can earn the respect of world industry leaders and gain access to a career elevator by winning a prestigious competition. <br><br>  Some people constantly walk (even at night) on the career ladders of a house called the IT industry - you just have to listen.  And you can get together on the staircase and more closely track the trajectories of movement of these subjects, to study the nature of movement.  And then it turns out that each of these trajectories has its own point of reference and coordinate system, which we often want to correlate with the general scale of measurements. <br><br><h4>  Attention, attention: Nokia is shrinking </h4><br>  The management of <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nokia">Nokia has</a> decided to focus in making personnel decisions on the universal measure - money.  By 2018, the company intends to reduce costs by 900 million euros.  In the near future, management <a href="http://www.rbc.ru/business/21/05/2016/573f95b59a7947a8311ab7f1%3Ffrom%3Dnewsfeed">plans</a> to lay off more than 1,000 employees in Finland.  Nokia announced the impending reduction of 1,032 people.  If the company fired 1024 employees, it would allow to kill two birds with one stone: <a name="habracut"></a>  save the work of several employees and make this event significant, at the subconscious level, causing in the IT community a calmer reaction to the care of 2 ^ 10 employees. <br><blockquote>  But instead, Nokia tried not to widely publicize this story, reporting the news only in Finnish. </blockquote>  Moreover, these layoffs are part of Nokia‚Äôs global staff reduction of over 15,000 people due to the merger with Alcatel-Lucent.

      <br>
      The news of the reduction failed to go unnoticed amid recent <a href="http://www.vedomosti.ru/newsline/technology/news/2016/05/18/641487-nokia-sovmestno-hmd">news</a> that Microsoft is selling Foxconn‚Äôs Nokia mobile phone division for $ 350 million. <br><br><h4>  Fight for numbers </h4><br>  If, purely hypothetically, the dismissed specialists had applied to the recruitment agency Skillaz, they would be helped to find a new job, and the agency would be considerably enriched.  True, their new employers would be in Russia: a Russian recruiting agency.  But another option is also possible - Skillaz could ‚Äúfreeze‚Äù, unable to cope with the influx of applicants. <br><br>  But since neither threatens this online service, they decided to increase their sales and hired Yosif Panasyuk, the former director of webinar development for webinar services. <br><br>  At Skillaz as sales director, he will be building up the base of paying customers in Russia.  ‚ÄúSkillaz attracted me with the strongest product team, market development potential, and, most importantly, a real opportunity to change the traditional recruitment with the help of new approaches.  We see that already over $ 200 million a year is spent on recruiting online, and we are ready to fight for these figures, ‚ÄùPanasyuk <a href="http://firrma.ru/data/news/7838/">told</a> Firrma. <br><br><h4>  I'll go to the developers - let them teach me </h4><br>  If all the same long-suffering Nokia employees get depressed and go ‚Äúlooking for themselves‚Äù to India, then they will also be able to get training in the accelerator on design and development of applications for iOS.  <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple">Apple Inc.</a> itself <a href="http://www.apple.com/pr/library/2016/05/18Apple-Announces-New-iOS-App-Design-and-Development-Accelerator-in-Bengaluru.html">announced the</a> opening of the first accelerator center in Bangalore, India.  The company is going to support local startups and members of the community of iOS-developers. <br><br>  Apple will "inspire and instruct developers in best practices, help them develop their skills and transform the design, quality and performance of their applications on the iOS platform." <br><br>  Apple calls Bangalore "home of the local startup industry."  In this accelerator, Apple employees will conduct weekly briefings, as well as evaluate applications from local developers.  Also, the center will advise on the use of the Swift programming language. <br><br>  ‚ÄúIndia is the birthplace of one of the most resonant and entrepreneurial communities for iOS development in the world.  By opening this new establishment in Bangalore, we give developers access to tools that will help create innovative applications for customers around the world, ‚Äùsaid Apple CEO Tim Cook. <br><br>  True, thirsty for knowledge will have to wait, since Apple intends to open the accelerator only in 2017. <br><br><h4>  On the spot - in a career </h4><br>  However, in the IT industry there are those who could wait for the beginning, but are not ready to wait for the end of training - they are able to loudly declare themselves right now. <br><br>  The St. Petersburg State University team from St. Petersburg <a href="https://icpc.baylor.edu/scoreboard/">became the</a> winner of the ACM ICPC 2016 international student programming contest, the final of which was held in Phuket. <br><br>  Gold medals were given to teams that took the first four places.  In addition to St. Petersburg State University and Shanghai University, participants from Harvard (3rd place) and the Russian MIPT (4th place) received the highest awards. <br><br>  The general list of the first 12 places for which medals are awarded includes five Russian teams.  Ural Federal University was placed immediately after ITMO and took 8th place (both teams received silver medals), Nizhny Novgorod State University received 10th place and a bronze medal. <br><br>  In the final, participants were asked to solve 11 problems in 5 hours with the help of a single computer.  ‚ÄúTasks of the championship consist of a legend (a description of a fictional situation), examples of tests and formal restrictions.  To find a solution, the team needs to ‚Äútranslate‚Äù the problem into the language of mathematics;  then participants develop a solution algorithm and write code, ‚Äùthey say at ITMO. <br><br>  Prize-winners received invitations for internships in the research offices of IBM (sponsored the competition) and other international IT companies. <br><br><h4>  Divination on a binary heap </h4><br>  What future awaits these outstanding athletes-programmers, the thoughtful reader of "Habra" easily predicts.  But what about other students - mere mortals?  Looking at the rapid development of the IT industry, you can even put the question squarely: will today's students be needed tomorrow for the positions of various IT specialists? <br><br>  On May 20, Alyona Vladimirskaya gave a lecture at the University of Innopolis, the founder of the recruiting agencies "Talanting" and PRUFFI.  Her companies are engaged in the examination of the labor market of the IT industry, maintaining a database of the best specialists and young talents, provide consulting services and search for stars for large companies. <br><br>  Mrs. Vladimirskaya is confident that technology will radically change the labor market in the coming years.  The Rusbase edition <a href="http://rusbase.com/opinion/alyona-vladimirskaya-rasskazala-kak-izmenitsya-rynok-truda-v-skorom-budushem/">shared the</a> main points of her lecture: <br><blockquote>  1. Robotics.  Automation and abolition of many service specialties. <br><br>  2. Agro.  The whole world is invested in modern food.  In this sector we can become leaders. <br><br>  3. Internet of things.  We need lawyers who control the relationship between man and mechanisms. <br><br>  4. 3D printing.  There is a growing demand for people serving sophisticated hardware and software. <br><br>  5. Medicine.  Gadgets will replace the profession of therapist. <br><br>  6. Energy.  Requires engineers and innovation managers. <br><br>  7. Urbanist.  We need designers and builders of cities of the new type. <br><br>  8. Marketing.  Only specialists who understand Digital and Data Science will remain. <br><br>  9. Education.  We need producers of online education - to pack courses. <br><br>  10. Journalism.  In the coming years, drones will force out field reporters, and expert journalism will develop. <br><br>  11. Entertainment.  We need people who come up with personal services in the tourism and restaurant business. <br><br>  12. Consulting.  The personal consultation segment will grow. <br><br>  13. Games.  There are not enough eSports managers, scriptwriters, programmers and developers of new types of entertainment for virtual reality. <br><br>  14. Finance.  Employees of back offices are being reduced, but specialists are required at the junction of IT and banking, mathematics and psychology. </blockquote></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/301392/">https://habr.com/ru/post/301392/</a></p>
