Information on the network is extremely small, and below we will tell why.  But a holy place is never empty - where there are few facts, conjectures and rumors arise, such is the nature of man.  No exception, and HyperX Fury 3D, about which they began to invent utter wildness.  So we hasten to fill the information vacuum and test new drives. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/f5/sg/za/f5sgza-q_qvmjabh0anex6zkecc.jpeg"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h1>  Genealogy </h1><br>  About 5 years ago HyperX Fury drives appeared on the shelves.  Many people liked them due to their ‚Äútasty‚Äù prices and decent performance, these drives became popular among gamers.  By the way, even today, the speed of HyperX Fury is enough for everyday work.  Alas, the production of these drives had to be curtailed, because they used the controllers of the company SandForce, which went hand in hand.  But the demand for fast and inexpensive drives for gamers has not gone away, so the HyperX Fury family tree has not withered and continued to grow. <br><br>  We recently <a href="https://habr.com/ru/company/kingston_technology/blog/428600/">talked</a> about the HyperX Fury RGB drive.  Also SATA in the 2.5-inch form factor, but its features are LED color backlighting.  The novelty is not for the mass consumer, but for connoisseurs of modding with backlit components.  It is understandable, the average user who collects a gaming PC in a deaf body, the delights of illumination are uninteresting, and the conservative part of the audience itself RGB abbreviation is already causing resentment :).

      As a result, HyperX Fury 3D appeared - light and fast gaming drives without any wrappers.  Everything is strict and to the point. <br><br><h1>  HyperX Fury 3D </h1><br>  Do not try to find English-language reviews - this is so far not a massive product: HyperX Fury 3D is now sold only in Russia and Ukraine.  And not at every corner, but only through some partners.  All these limitations are related to the fact that we want to first evaluate the reaction of buyers to the properties and capabilities of the new product, before offering it worldwide.  This is especially pleasant, because it is not often the world's major manufacturers choose our region for the debut of new devices. <br><br>  Since HyperX Fury 3D is now available for sale only from a small number of companies, little is known about these drives to the general public.  And rumors spread - they say, it's all refurbished devices.  More like a malicious stuffing, but because someone from unprepared readers can believe it. <br><br>  Let's see what HyperX Fury 3D really is.  Or rather, the 240-gigabyte model with a factory index KC-S44240-6F. <br><br><h1>  Appearance </h1><br>  Accessibility is one of the main concepts underlying the HyperX Fury family.  Therefore, the drive is supplied in a compact blister, which can be opened only by cutting. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/lk/ct/q1/lkctq1dqlmlehhuclm_dxzhul5q.jpeg"><br><br>  The package is ascetic, except for the drive itself, in the blister there is an adhesive frame made of soft foam material and a proprietary sticker. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/u5/lh/3b/u5lh3be8f3cojswgzadl_bszwaa.jpeg"><br><br>  The design of the drive itself is almost the same as the ‚Äúprogenitor‚Äù, HyperX Fury. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/th/l6/ur/thl6urn_decgq5qtd36kutorfpm.jpeg"><br><br>  By the way, pay attention to one of the ‚Äúdegrees of protection‚Äù: above the designation of the storage capacity of a drive, a piece of a gray strip is poured differently if you slightly turn the device under the light. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/cm/3b/xe/cm3bxeha_aet-5rwccqtw1wh97a.png"><br><br>  From the back of the eye there is nothing to catch on, a smooth aluminum bottom: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/co/re/yg/coreyggqgof3meydf6c0todtyek.jpeg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/ai/ow/zz/aiowzzyonewxv0axmpdgset8eoi.jpeg"><br><br>  The dimensions of the drive are 100.3 x 70 x 6.7 mm (measured with a caliper, since there is no data on the ruler on the official website yet). <br><br><h1>  Insides </h1><br>  Now let's see what HyperX Fury 3D has inside - let's open the device. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/ur/kv/8s/urkv8svqgyhd3hmbqtl9iwnbtys.jpeg"><br><br>  The fee takes only half the case.  This is a consequence of the miniaturization of memory chips - in the 240-gigabyte HyperX Fury 3D, four Micron 3D TLC 8UA2D NW912 chips are used, two on one side and two on the other. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/kn/mb/rj/knmbrjxnr8xwtbpvkf_49krg5iu.jpeg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/p0/dr/o8/p0dro8ybktpia8sqfsu0ysyeuqa.jpeg"><br><br>  As a controller in HyperX Fury 3D is used Kingston CS4341AA.  Surely Kingston himself began to produce controllers?  Not really.  Under this label is SATA3 TFBGA144 SM2258XT from the company SMI.  This universal controller uses the NANDXtend proprietary error correction algorithm (ECC). <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/ec/db/fu/ecdbfun9zhzpll9le6hukygr0ku.jpeg"><br><br><h1>  Testing </h1><br>  Now let's see what different utilities for testing drives will show us.  The disk is connected to the motherboard, not yet initialized and not formatted.  First, run CrystalDiskInfo 8.x: <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/0m/5k/q_/0m5kq_f00rqebz8lrsntrrkfwgk.png" width="500"></div><br>  Immediately after formatting, run CrystalDiskMark 6.x: <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/0e/md/ic/0emdic_9j9ztatvp6acvmdtulw8.png" width="500"></div><br><br>  I was curious to compare with my personal HyperX Fury, also 240 GB, which I have been working on my system drive since October 2015.  Now its characteristics are as follows: <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/rp/ac/1v/rpac1vzhdqr6fwpzlsrvty2p5ae.png" width="500"></div><br><br>  But back to our newcomer.  What will the TxBENCH benchmark show us? <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/wq/ez/6p/wqez6pmxkai1puey5xm23qjitpy.png"><br><br>  Anvil's Storage Utilities: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/g0/xw/b4/g0xwb4d-6lx8vj2_agvfipfp68q.png"><br><br>  And finally, the results of the benchmark PC MARK 8, which emulates bandwidth for different applications: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/fd/yf/nv/fdyfnvwt6sz5ctbnuxor08_j_a8.png"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/uw/tf/eg/uwtfeg5itb1vmjp9islj8i9y7ko.png"><br><br>  By modern standards, my computer is not too drawn to gaming, as you can see from the specification, except for a video card, which is still quite good.  But even this configuration allows you to comfortably play modern shooters, yes, with only 8 GB of RAM, including Battlefield 1 and Battlefield 5. True, I prefer Battlefield 4, which works without any problems on the ‚Äúultra‚Äù graphics settings.  I throw over the installed game (about 65 GB) on HyperX Fury 3D: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/q5/2t/bu/q52tbuuyvtajrzz3yaxjrp3belq.png"><br>  <i>Transfer the game to HyperX Fury 3D.</i> <br><br>  At this speed, 95% of the game was copied.  I launch the shortcut, it took about 35 seconds before the main menu appeared.  Slightly less, 32 seconds, went from the beginning of the connection to one of the servers and before entering the game. <br><br>  I transfer the game back to my system disk, there is a difference in the recording speed of the old Fury and the new Fury 3D: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/jo/9v/qz/jo9vqzzgvisgo4dkvczp98wp97o.png"><br>  <i>Transfer the game back with HyperX Fury 3D.</i> <i><br><br></i> <h1>  Finally </h1><br>  HyperX Fury 3D is a new low-cost SSD-drive that will be interesting for widespread use in home computers as a system disk, as well as for assembling gaming machines of the primary and secondary levels: even mine, not the freshest and most powerful computer comfortably pulls modern 3D games.  Yes, not at the maximum settings, but the ‚Äúbottleneck‚Äù is not the SSD performance, but the video card's capabilities.  During games, there are no brakes due to the ‚Äúthoughtfulness‚Äù of the drive, and after all, this model is already 5 years old.  And HyperX Fury 3D surpasses my ‚Äúold man‚Äù in all metrics, in fact, it is only held back by SATA 3 throughput. <br><br>  Of course, if we are talking about professional e-sports or dynamic modern shooters with maximum settings on a 4K monitor, then these are completely different computer configurations, other bus capacities and interfaces.  For these machines are other drives.  And HyperX Fury 3D is a real ‚Äúpopular‚Äù SSD for everyday work and games.  Indeed, despite the technical progress and the release of more and more high-speed drives, the most demanded are still 2.5-inch models with a capacity of 120 and 240 GB. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/1k/l9/7q/1kl97qa1iwtadbynigdgznoku7w.png"><br><br>  HyperX Fury 3D SSDs are exhibited in Citylink stores at recommended retail prices: <br><blockquote>  <a href="http://hyperx.gg/HabrFury3D">HyperX Fury 3D 120 GB</a> - 1890 rubles. <br>  <a href="http://hyperx.gg/HabrFury3D">HyperX Fury 3D 240 GB</a> - 2990 rubles. </blockquote><br>  For more information about <a href="https://bit.ly/2mdGrDZ">HyperX</a> and <a href="https://www.kingston.com/">Kingston</a> products, please visit the company websites. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/441682/">https://habr.com/ru/post/441682/</a></p>
