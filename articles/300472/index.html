Their revenue for 2015 increased by almost 50% - up to 28.2 billion rubles. <br><br>  Also in 2015, the number of jobs in the Skolkovo IT companies increased by almost a half.  In 2014, the number of jobs did not exceed 8563, and in 2015 it increased to 12 thousand.  In 2015, the companies filed 237 applications for the registration of intellectual property, and in 2014 - 227. <br><br>  Igor Bogachev disclosed the financial results of some residents.

      For example, <a href="http://sk.ru/net/1120554">Diasoft Systems</a> , a subsidiary of an IT solutions provider for Diasoft banks, in 2014 was able to earn 381 million rubles with a net profit of 15.2 million rubles. <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  Revenue <a href="http://rfdyn.ru/">"Rock Flow Dynamics"</a> (Rock Flow Dynamics), creating software for modeling the development of oil and gas fields, amounted to 257.7 million (80% more than a year earlier) with a net profit of 139.4 million rubles. <br><br>  The creator of the technology for protecting digital video content, <a href="https://pladform.ru/about/eua">‚ÄúPlatform‚Äù,</a> ended 2014 with revenues of 468.8 million rubles (1000% more than in 2013) with a net profit of 48.7 million rubles. <br><br>  ‚ÄúWe used to observe a boom in e-commerce and online projects, but it is gradually fading.  Today, investments in technological teams are most successful.  A vivid example of such an investment is the <a href="https://megamozg.ru/post/25707/">NGINX</a> team, ‚Äù <a href="http://www.cnews.ru/articles/itklaster_skolkovo_aziya__klyuchevoe">said</a> Bogachev to CNews. <br><br>  In 2015, the IT cluster added three new areas to work: <br><blockquote>  The first was the robotics and artificial intelligence, we see great prospects and a good scientific foundation in Russia for creating robotic teams and technologies.  The second significant direction is mobile technologies and wearable devices.  That is, everything that underlies the Internet of things. <br><br>  And finally, the third area is computer graphics and gamification.  Imagine that in 10 years people who have grown up on online games and social networks will come into business.  We consider gamification as a serious trend associated with a change in the interface of software products, so that technology from games comes into ordinary life. <br></blockquote>  At the end of 2015, 450 residents of the cluster managed to attract 2.2 billion rubles of investment - this is half the amount than a year earlier.  The head of the IT cluster explained this by changes in the economic situation in the country, <a href="http://www.cnews.ru/news/top/2016-04-27_top_itrezidentov_skolkovo_chempiony_po_vyruchke">writes</a> CNews. <br><br>  Despite changes in the economic situation, the number of IT cluster residents who sell products abroad has increased almost one and a half times over the year.  If in 2014 there were 62 of them, then in 2015, 91 companies were engaged in foreign economic activity. <br><blockquote>  Even before the beginning of geopolitical turbulence, we began to actively develop the theme of the Asian region, and in the spring of 2014, with eight of our companies, we went to Hong Kong and China.  And Hong Kong seems to us the most correct reference point for this.  On the one hand, there are experts who know the market and speak Chinese, in fact, Hong Kong - this is China.  But on the other hand, there is Anglo-Saxon legislation in the field of intellectual property protection, which is certainly very important for technology teams. <br><br>  And most importantly: they created unique government conditions related to financial support, with organizations similar to Skolkovo, which help locate offices in the technopark, receive grants and benefits.  Starting from Hong Kong, Skolkovo has built quite a lot of interesting relationships with various Chinese partners, including venture funds. <br></blockquote></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/300472/">https://habr.com/ru/post/300472/</a></p>
