I will try now to make a few posts, which will focus on the most significant ideas. <br><br>  The first thing I always come across is a rather vague understanding, even among specialists, of the role of emotions in a person and how emotions control behavior. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  The everyday approach looks like this: <br><ul><li>  when a certain situation gives us emotions or sensations, we commit acts under the influence of the emotions that have arisen; </li><li>  if a certain act promises the emergence of positive emotions, we commit this act, and the emotion is a stimulus; </li><li>  emotions are the source of our activity and ‚Äúforce‚Äù us to act; </li><li>  Emotions implement instincts - the nature of the program of behavior, aimed at the implementation of a certain "expedient" behavior. </li></ul><br>  In all of the above, there is not a word of truth! <br><br>  The main source of errors is described by a principle that was formulated a couple of thousand years ago: ‚Äúafter that, it does not mean due to that‚Äù.  The action takes place after the emotions or their expectations, but this does not mean that due to them.

      Surprisingly, the further narrative will resemble a ‚Äújourney in three pines‚Äù, but how many people still wander in these pines! <br><br>  Imagine that information from our senses forms a sensory layer.  Initially, there are unconditioned reflexes from birth, they trigger on a certain state of the sensory layer and cause the action associated with it.  Here I hope it is clear. <br><br>  Now imagine that there are unconditioned reflexes that do not cause any action, but lead to the appearance of emotions or sensations.  What would be more convenient to imagine imagine a light bulb, some are painted in warm colors, while others are cold.  Some correspond to positive emotions, and others to negative ones.  Imagine that we are connected, immobilized, but perceive what is happening.  Light bulbs will blink merrily, reflecting our emotional state.  Emotions determine our attitude to what is happening, they state that what is happening is ‚Äúgood‚Äù or ‚Äúbad.‚Äù <br><br>  Moreover, this ‚Äúgood‚Äù, ‚Äúbad‚Äù is sewn up from birth in the system of unconditioned reflexes.  I will not complicate the story now and describe how the evaluation of complex phenomena takes place, how upbringing affects the value system, take my word for it, that I know the answer, but now I would like to convey the basic idea using simple examples. <br><br>  The lights flash and what's next?  Well, untie us.  Will we move, of course, because we have unconditional reflexes.  As a result of our movements, the situation is changing, its assessment is changing with emotions, and the glow of light bulbs is changing.  And now memory comes on the scene.  Stop, we will immediately make a reservation, now the conversation is not about what we can remember and imagine the events of the past, but about the fact that there is memory as a tool consisting of neurons. <br>  Every time when there is a change in the emotional state, the memory remembers the situation in which we are, from what elements it develops, what actions we perform and to which change of emotions it corresponds.  That is, the role of light bulbs, that is, emotions, does not push us into action, but rather evaluate what has already been accomplished and allow us to form a memory. <br><br>  Then everything is simple.  When we encounter something familiar to all the memory elements that have learned what is happening, they begin to ‚Äúpush‚Äù us on the actions that they remember, if these memories corresponded to a positive change in emotions and ‚Äúslow down‚Äù from actions that corresponded to a negative change in emotions. <br><br>  The stronger the emotion and fresh memory, the stronger the contribution of the memory.  If the memories are contradictory, we will summarize and see what will win. <br><br>  The act that we ultimately accomplish, we will accomplish under the action of memory, accomplish subconsciously.  We are aware of the emotion that will be at this moment and the perfect act itself.  And many still think that this emotion has caused this action. <br><br>  For particularly picky readers who say that this explains not all, I will note that our fantasies elicit the same emotional assessment as real events.  And we create memories based on them, and these memories of the ‚Äúvirtual‚Äù experience immediately begin to shape our behavior. <br><br>  Actually, according to this principle, Pavlov‚Äôs dog for a series of thirty experiments forms a conditioned reflex, a wake-saliva.  And a child, once falling from a ladder, begins to be afraid of heights.  The principle is the same, the difference in the strength of emotional reinforcement. <br><br>  Often we do not realize what our behavior is caused by, where are the reasons, and where are the consequences, where are the unconditioned reflexes, and where is the work of memory.  We will understand a simple example.  Suppose you touch your hand with a red-hot electric stove.  You hurt you pull back your hand.  That's all. <br><br>  And now the points: <br><br><ul><li>  Impulses from peripheral pain receptors cause an unconditioned reflex - withdrawal of the hand. </li><li>  These same pulses cause another reflex - the sensation of pain. </li><li>  We see a red plate, this image is recognized by us.  We experience a severe deterioration in our emotional state caused by sharp pain.  A memory is formed about the red plate and touching it with a strong negative ‚Äúcolor‚Äù. </li><li>  Reflex otdergivaniya hands leads to the fact that the sharp pain passes and even if there is a weaker pain from the burn, this corresponds to a strong positive change in the emotional state.  A memory is formed that links the red plate, the hand that touches it, and the fact that the withdrawal was strongly positively ‚Äúcolored‚Äù (‚Äúpositively‚Äù should not be confused with ‚Äúpleasantly‚Äù, the transition from the state is very bad to less bad). </li></ul><br>  Total: <br><ul><li>  we no longer touch the red plate; </li><li>  accidentally touching something like a red plate, we withdraw our hand, even if there is nothing hot or dangerous. </li></ul><br><br>  Maybe short and indistinct, but did not want to become boring. <br><br>  In the next article I will describe a model on neurons that implements all of the above. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/105205/">https://habr.com/ru/post/105205/</a></p>
