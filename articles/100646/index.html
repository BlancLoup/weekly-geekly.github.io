(Part 1: Online Shopping)</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  The online store is a showcase, the facade of the building, staff, lighting ... I think I was mistaken and describe a regular store.  No, the online store is not much different from its real counterpart.  The main page is a facade, a signboard, and a store decoration.  Search - these are sales assistants ... and so on ... Opening a successful online business is no easier than in reality, although spending money is much less. <br>  Online store, very tempting business, in this article I will discuss the problems associated only with usability in most online stores.  The easiest way to learn from the mistakes of others, let's do it and do it! <a name="habracut"></a><br><br><img title="image" alt="image" src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/f68/832/9d0/f688329d0ef9e45dc7268fb9187d23e5.png" width="812" height="376"><br><br>  What are the problems in% of the name of the store% (the first one from the Yandex Market).  I see a lot of them, a lot.  Let's take it in order: <br>  <font color="#ff0000">minus the</font> name of the store and the phone in the upper left corner - so that no one noticed.  <em>It makes sense to hide the name only to the unfair seller.</em> <br>  <font color="#ff0000">minus</font> Why there is no contact store on the main?  <em>A potential buyer visiting this site at a glance and you will not tell in which country and city it is located.</em>  <em>Only +7 (495) Tells us about Moscow.</em>  <em>I personally did not immediately see this phone.</em> <br>  <font color="#ff0000">minus</font> Basket, why is she?  <em>I just went in, they show me that in my basket there are 0 goods for 0 amount ... why then should I show it?</em>  <em>Apparently to stimulate shopping.</em> <em><br></em> <img title="image" alt="image" src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/e7c/faf/e97/e7cfafe97307efcbd8e883dc579869c6.png" width="489" height="377">
