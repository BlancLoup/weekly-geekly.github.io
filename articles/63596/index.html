I decided to publish its results for the company I work for now. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a>  1. <i>Do you use source code version control system?</i> <br>  Not.  This company is the second in which I work as a php programmer.  For some incomprehensible reason, neither the system nor the previous one used such systems, which is very sad.  How much less would be a problem.  By the way, Joel himself advises the programmer to start using CVS himself and try to add other developers to this. <br><br>  2. <i>Can you build the product in one step?</i> <br>  No I can not.  Although for some projects there are scripts for automatically deploying a web application on a production server.  But this is only for a few new projects. 
      <br>

      <br>
      3. <i>Do you perform daily compilation?</i> <br>  Well no.  Unfortunately, I don‚Äôt know how the Java programmers team works. <br><br>  4. <i>Do you maintain a database of errors in the program?</i> <br>  Not. <br><br>  5. <i>Do you fix bugs before writing a new code?</i> <br>  Not.  Often errors are detected already at the stage of ‚Äúindustrial operation‚Äù.  And most often, the correction of errors is entrusted to completely different people who had no relation to the project before.  Very sad situation. <br><br>  6. <i>Do you have a current work schedule?</i> <br>  Haha  Yes, there is some kind of nonsense that is crammed into a calendar in an exendzh server, but it isn‚Äôt exactly that to be relevant.  And there is no detail of the schedule, which "requires" Joel. <br><br>  7. <i>Do you have specifications?</i> <br>  I would say no.  It happens that some papers are written.  If you're lucky, there will be screens to do.  If less, then the text with a bunch of ambiguous texts.  Often I will just take a look at this, and then put it on the edge of the table, because they are all pretty useless. <br><br>  8. <i>Did you create a calm environment for the work of programmers?</i> <br>  This item upsets me the most, probably.  No, no and NO.  Next to the programmers are managers, phones are always ringing, someone is walking, talking.  Half of the programmers have disgusting chairs, after an hour of sitting on which the ass becomes square.  In general, I would say that the conditions are disgusting. <br><br>  9. <i>Do you try to use the best existing tools for work?</i> <br>  Let‚Äôs say yes.  That is, I must say that we have different programmers.  And different applications are written in different languages ‚Äã‚Äã(C #, Java, PHP, Perl) and use different databases (Oracle, MySQL, PostgreSQL).  True, I do not know who and what is guided by the choice of languages, tools and technologies. <br><br>  10. <i>Do you involve testers?</i> <br>  Not.  Also a terrible moment.  Programmers are testing everything themselves.  Then another manager can potestit. <br><br>  11. <i>Do you offer job seekers to write code during the interview?</i> <br>  Well, when I was interviewed, the second part was the execution of test tasks.  The tasks were very simple, they could hardly assess me somehow.  Everything that could be said about them, that yes, I at least read the book ‚ÄúPHP in 24 hours‚Äù.  Spolsky himself advises checking out a little more.  But we shall. <br><br>  12. <i>Do you test ‚Äúusability‚Äù on random people?</i> <br>  No, if the general liked it, then so be it. <br><br>  Total three points.  What about this Joel writes: ‚ÄúIdeally, you should score 12 points.  11 points is a tolerable amount, and 10 or less indicate serious problems.  In fact, most software organizations work with only two or three points, and they need major improvements because companies like Microsoft keep 12 points all the time. ‚Äù <br>  And how are you? <br><br>  <i>Apd</i>  If interested, then Joel Spolsky maintains a blog <a href="http://joelonsoftware.com/">‚ÄúJoel on Software‚Äù</a> , based on which books are published. <br>  <i>Apd # 2</i> <a href="http://joelonsoftware.com/articles/fog0000000043.html">Original of "Joel's test" with explanations</a> . </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/63596/">https://habr.com/ru/post/63596/</a></p>
