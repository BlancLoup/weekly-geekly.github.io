I use it for a week, and I would like to touch on some aspects of this device.  Perhaps this will help people decide whether this smartphone is suitable for them or not.  In part, I will compare it with the HTC Touch, since I used it for a year and a half and got used to it as my own. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/2fa/0b4/55f/2fa0b455ffd992e56571af4d0151fba3.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><h4>  General characteristics of the smartphone: </h4><br>  <b>Processor:</b> Qualcomm MSM7225 528 MHz. <br>  <b>OS:</b> Windows Mobile 6.1 Professional. <br>  <b>Memory:</b> 512 Mb ROM, 256 Mb RAM. <br>  <b>Dimensions and weight:</b> 102x53.5x14.5 mm, 103 g. <br>  <b>Display:</b> 2.8 ", QVGA (320x240). <br>  GSM 850/900/1800/1900 MHz, EDGE / GPRS, UMTS / HSDPA 2100. <br>  <b>GPS:</b> gpsOne chip, A-GPS. <br>  <b>Interfaces:</b> Wi-Fi b / g, Bluetooth 2.0 + EDR, ExtUSB (USB 2.0), microSDHC slot. <br>  <b>Camera:</b> 3 Mp. <br>  <b>Battery:</b> Li-Ion with a capacity of 1100 mA ¬∑ h.

      I will not write about what is already known, for this you can read reviews on neighboring resources.  For example, the <a href="http://www.mobile-review.com/pda/review/htc-touch-cruise2.shtml">first impressions of the Mobile-Review</a> and a <a href="http://mobile.mail.ru/reviews/htc/HTC_Touch_Cruise_2-rev.html">review on mail.ru.</a>  I will go towards user feelings.  I will iron and scold the new Iolite, the massacre will be merciless.  ))) I will try to illustrate the material with relevant photos. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  So‚Ä¶ <br><br><h4>  <b>‚ÄúIolite, how is it flying?‚Äù Part one is mechanics, materials and design.</b> </h4><br>  Great design!  I am very picky in this regard and I love it when things look beautiful.  Gray metallic edging on the top edge adds its own flavor.  Beautifully made oblong speaker talk above the screen, unlike my former HTC Touch.  The control panel and navigation under the screen is also beautiful and pleasant to the touch, thanks to its smooth, metallic coating.  And, of course, not to mention the famous cruise wheels of navigation.  It was one of the factors that led me to choose HTC Iolite, not HTC Jade (3G).  Since I started talking about the controls, I would like to mention two additional hard buttons (Navigation and Footprint), on which you can hang useful functions.  Agree, this is a nice bonus to the phone, considering that HTC is trying to deprive us of the button control all the time. <br><br> <a href="http://img4.imageshack.us/my.php%3Fimage%3Dimg8873z.jpg"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/5e9/818/b4a/5e9818b4acf8e7181c1eef19cc7acec5.jpg"></a> <a href="http://img7.imageshack.us/my.php%3Fimage%3Dimg8842q.jpg"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/8dd/f9d/18b/8ddf9d18b23040a371daf1e919aed974.jpg"></a> <br><br>  But not everything is as wonderful as we would like.  The developers, with some kind of foolishness, put a ‚Äúsoft reset‚Äù piping under the back cover of the device.  Accordingly, if your ayolitic is stuck, then in any case you will have to remove the cover, either for a soft-reset or for pulling out the battery.  It's probably worth mentioning here that, unlike the HTC Touch, the cover is not conveniently removed.  Not the way it is in most phones - push your thumb in a certain place on the back cover and push up or squeeze the clip like on a Nokia.  It needs to be podkovyrivat nail on the bottom and then the same nail podkovyrnut from different sides, so that it opens to the end.  Not the most pleasant procedure, I throw a stone in the direction of the developers, who obviously drank the wrong thing on the day of the development of this part.  On the HTC Touch there was a hole on the bottom, which had to be pressed with a stylus and the device immediately went to reboot.  Why did not save this concept I can not understand. <br><br>  Fortunately, there are two additional, mechanical buttons that slightly compensate for this disadvantage.  I solved the reboot problem with the help of the <a href="http://ae.inc.ru/aebplusr.php">AE Button Plus</a> program, which helped me to put a ‚Äúsoft reset‚Äù on a long press on the Navigation button.  And everything fell into place. <br><br>  Cover back cover quality and pleasant to the touch.  Slides a little in hand, as plastic, in my opinion a little rubberized.  Although, I would add more rubber, so as not to strive to meet with asphalt.  There is also a thin speaker, which by the way, quite small and rather weak.  It looks beautiful, but little sense.  HTC was greedy in this regard.  In my opinion, the Touch was louder, although there the speaker grid looks several times larger.  But damn, this is still a device designed for a richer audience, really could not be done conscientiously ?!  If you put it in the process of playing music back cover on the table, the sound becomes deaf and flat.  In this case, by itself, the volume of the sound is almost halved.  It is unpleasant that such an important moment was not taken into account and the speaker was not taken out a little closer to one of the side ends.  For the sake of justice, it is worth noting that the sound in the headphones is good and the volume is sufficient for comfortable listening to music, podcasts and audiobooks. <br> <a href="http://img9.imageshack.us/my.php%3Fimage%3Dimg8855j.jpg"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/a3d/279/1c2/a3d2791c2c25c60212088556f9db3acb.jpg"></a> <br><br>  The stylus is like a stylus, but unlike HTC Diamond and HTC Pro, it has a magnet on it.  In addition, if you cut the nails quite shortly, it will be difficult to roll it out.  HTC for some reason abandoned the ladder on the head of the stylus, thanks to which it was convenient to cling it even with the edge of a finger, not a fingernail.  In addition, the edge for the hook, for some reason not clear to mankind, was made parallel to the stylus, rather than perpendicular, such as on the HTC Touch.  A silly trifle, which nevertheless complicates the use of the apparatus a little.  Dull, minor flaws, upset the most, because this could have been avoided.  That would have cost nothing. <br> <a href="http://img22.imageshack.us/my.php%3Fimage%3Dimg8858a.jpg"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/2c9/ca6/9fb/2c9ca69fb09d510e05b02a5bef28366a.jpg"></a> <br><br>  For the sake of justice, it is worth noting that despite the fact that the slot for micro sd card is under the back cover, it is very convenient to use, unlike previous models of HTC and Nokia.  The device itself lies comfortably in your hand, the screen size is optimal for one-handed operation.  Finger reaches all corners of the screen.  Compact, convenient model, with the merits and demerits.  In addition, thanks to my design, I want to call the device with the word ‚Äúsexy‚Äù.  In my opinion in design, he wins from his progenitor -HTC Touch Cruise. <br> <a href="http://img7.imageshack.us/my.php%3Fimage%3Dimg8844c.jpg"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/79c/874/254/79c874254d2129cb45dc08a2707b70dc.jpg"></a> <a href="http://img4.imageshack.us/my.php%3Fimage%3Dimg8870o.jpg"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/e7d/89a/8fd/e7d89a8fd424cd05c148d585e91e0589.jpg"></a> <br><br>  That's all for now.  I will try to consider other advantages and disadvantages of the device in the course of my review, if you will certainly like it and generally need someone.  :) <br><br>  Photos to compare the dimensions.
