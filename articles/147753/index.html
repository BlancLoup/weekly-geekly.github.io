And many thanks to everyone who helped in organizing and conducting. <br><br>  I do not know how to correctly translate the word meetup into Russian.  Do not call mitap.  This is not another conference, this is another.  At large conferences, such as HighLoad, RIT, etc., specialists from large companies talk about tasks, problems and solutions that are often beyond the capacity horizon of smaller companies.  This is very interesting and informative, but for the most part it is of little use from a practical point of view.  The meetup format is completely different, and more like a round table.  His goal is to share experiences with colleagues from other companies, customers and partners.  To exchange "cones" and "rakes" to learn not only from their own, but also from others' mistakes.  In Silicon Valley, such events usually take place either in the offices of the organizing companies, or in some neutral cafes.  In Moscow, we tried to gather people after working in Digital October.  And it worked out well.

    <a name="habracut"></a>  The CTO presentation of our company (LifeStreet) by Serge Yoffe instead of the planned 45 minutes took almost two hours.  This was partly due to numerous questions on the case and not so much from some overly impatient participants.  But the main thing - it was very bright and interesting.  Serge is a great seller (sales), and knows how to interest listeners.  Well, the architecture of our solutions in itself, of course, is not trivial.  Questions poured in and after the presentation, and in the intervals, and even when it was all over. <br><br>  Then I told about the approach to Big Data in our company.  Since I had to conduct the meetup myself, and I was well aware of the time constraints, I had to crumple up my presentation in order to catch the rest.  It was rather abstract, as I tried to tell about the general principles of rational work with big data, which we learned.  We use rare RDBMS Vertica, but this is not very important.  There were probably not many database specialists in the room, and there were almost no questions. <br><br>  Igor <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/users/ik62/" class="user_link">ik62</a> talked about our experience with Cassandra (see <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/lifestreet/blog/146115/">Cassandra through the eyes of Operations</a> ), and on the questions that followed, it was possible to judge that Cassandra was quite popular. <br><br>  Maxim spoke about the problems and lessons of application scalability in Java. <br><br>  And finally, another Maxim <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/users/malexejev/" class="user_link">malexejev</a> made an abbreviated version of the report on distributed caches, which is very interesting, but in a good way it takes 3-4 hours for a calm discussion (see the <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/events/735/">‚Äúround table‚Äù</a> on this topic). <br><br>  <i>(We are going to lay out slides of all reports somewhere)</i> <br><br>  It all started at seven in the evening, after work.  Maxim's report ended at half past nine, but the participants did not want to disperse.  At midnight everyone was kicked out.  In order not to die of hunger, there were sandwiches, pies, of course, coffee, cola, beer.  Beer even remained when I left. <br><br>  This meetup was conceived as the first of many.  <a href="http://www.meetup.com/bigmoscow/">Meetup group</a> open join.  And let's organize such events more or less regularly.  The first pancake was not a lump, as it seems to me, and it is necessary to create a tradition.  By the way, there were proposals for the venue, to transfer it to universities, for example, as a special seminar.  Not sure if this is the right idea, but having ideas is better than not having them. <br><br>  See you at the next meetup! <br><br>  PS I posted this report so far only in the corporate hub.  It may make sense to place it somewhere else, but I'm not very sure where it will be appropriate.  If you have any suggestions - write in the comments.  Thank. <br></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/147753/">https://habr.com/ru/post/147753/</a></p>
