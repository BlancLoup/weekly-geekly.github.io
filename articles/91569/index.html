      Stumbled upon this topic <br>  <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/google/75684/">http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/google/75684/</a> <br><br>  However, I didn‚Äôt want to cry, but just to tell about the situation and point out the impudent policy of the company and Google‚Äôs support workers, who asked them not to write again. <br><br>  Situation. <br><br>  Not really, a small store on the MMORPG services (selling items for the game, etc.) apparently the business is not entirely unambiguous. <br><br>  On the one hand, game developers do not want to see such services and try to put pressure on the problem of copyright and the sale of intellectual property.  On the other hand, in fact, nothing is violated, since property is not sold anywhere and remains in the game, and each unit of such a business violates the maximum rules of a separate game, which is not punishable by law. <br><br>  As a result, advertising of this type of services is not prohibited by any PPC network including Google. <br>  Enter "Buy WOW Gold" for example in any search engine. <br><br>  And so having finished the store, I decided to launch a small test company Google Adwords.  Waiting for consideration of the company had to wait a long time, during this time it turned out to run the same advertisements in Yahoo and Bing. <br>  However, when two weeks passed and the ad unit was all ‚ÄúPending review‚Äù I decided to write in support and clarify. <br>  And as it turned out, my account was suspended, without any explanation. <br>  I decided that it was still a mistake, why suddenly such drastic actions?  And wrote again. <br><br>  The answer was the following: <br><br>  Thank you for your patience.  I have reconsulted the specialist team about <br>  our team's decision is <br>  correct and final.  Your ads will no longer run on Google.  This policy will <br>  apply to all accounts you have created.  As noted in our Terms and <br>  Conditions, Google reserves to terminate advertisements for any <br>  reason.  To view our Terms and Conditions, please visit <br>  <a href="https://adwords.google.com/select/tsandcsfinder">adwords.google.com/select/tsandcsfinder</a> . <br><br>  Our support team is unable to provide any further information.  <b>Please do</b> <b><br></b>  <b>not contact us again.</b>  For questions about other Google products, please <br>  visit <a href="http://www.google.com/support">www.google.com/support</a> .  We appreciate your cooperation. <br><br>  Also there was doubt was about <br><br>  <i>This policy will apply to all accounts you have created.</i> <br><br>  Really before there was another account, after my credit card did not work.  But no abuse and TP.  In general, to clarify this is not possible in any case, based on the answer. <br><br>  AdWords account is closed forever, without explaining the reason and asking you not to write about this anymore. <br><br>  I have never seen anything like it in my life, even a person who has committed a serious crime has the right to know why he was convicted and the right to correction. <br>  But not with Google? </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/91569/">https://habr.com/ru/post/91569/</a></p>
