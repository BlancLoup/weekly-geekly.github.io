How are you?  I am not familiar with you, but at times I just need to speak out.  Usually, when I do it for a beer in the company of relatives and colleagues (often the same people), I need to raise my voice for a variety of reasons.  So please stay with me now. <br><br>  My good friend asked me a couple of questions a few months ago, and now I think about them all the time.  I think about everything that I have learned in the last 10 years.  Have you learned a lot?  Perhaps you have learned to overcome fear, manage segway (I hope that this is not the case), cook smoked duck breast, blood sausage, or learn to play Jimi Hendrix's ‚Äú <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/Little_Wing">Little Wing</a> ‚Äù (if yes - respect you, and teach me, please).  But the most important thing is that you learned a bunch of different things, right?  Too much to keep everything in my head.

      <br>
      And here is another important question: how did you learn this? <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Maybe you watched educational videos, VERY-VERY practiced a lot, communicated with people a lot, survived the moment of insight, made big mistakes, read piles of books and tried many other methods that somehow should contribute to everything you could learn. will be remembered and no vacuum cleaner can suck it out of your head. <br><br>  Did you learn anything from online courses with ‚Äúreal‚Äù grades?  Or at corporate seminars with teachers and textbooks?  I will raise my hand and say that I have not done that.  This also applies to most of my friends. <br><br>  This leads us to the title of my article.  On Jerry Maguire, in the eponymous <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%2594%25D0%25B6%25D0%25B5%25D1%2580%25D1%2580%25D0%25B8_%25D0%259C%25D0%25B0%25D0%25B3%25D1%2583%25D0%25B0%25D0%25B9%25D0%25B5%25D1%2580">film</a> , he finds an epiphany late at night, and he writes down his main goals, which reunite him with who he is, what he does and why.  Of course, he is fired after he said ... But he not only finds himself, but continues his truly samurai way!  The fact that this happens in <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%259F%25D0%25BE%25D1%2581%25D0%25BB%25D0%25B5%25D0%25B4%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B9_%25D1%2581%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BC%25D1%2583%25D1%2580%25D0%25B0%25D0%25B9_%2528%25D1%2584%25D0%25B8%25D0%25BB%25D1%258C%25D0%25BC,_2003%2529">another</a> movie is not so important. <br><br>  What I lead to ... The learning industry cannot cope with its tasks.  We spend time discussing about tools for automated development of training courses, SCORM, learning management systems, the Kirkpatrick scale, and many other side things that prevent us from noticing the main thing: most of the training offered to us is complete crap.  Try asking your colleagues what they think about training at the seminars they attended.  As it is not sad, but their answers will not surprise you. <br><br><h4>  We must try harder. </h4><br>  If online courses and seminars are not for us what we love, thanks to which we learn and grow, then why do we offer them to our clients as a solution to their problems?  Do we know how to talk about growth and training without the certainty that by the end of a conversation the grains we have dropped will sprout? <br><br>  Now we understand that certain topics work best in online courses when there is a need to gain knowledge and something is at stake.  Well, I understood that.  And even better when they are consistent and not overwhelmed with stupid, multi-choice tests.  But let's be honest - This is following the standards.  Not learning.  Not solid training, which will ensure the preservation of knowledge in the long term. <br>  We must improve online learning for our own sake and for the responsibility that has been placed on us. <br><br>  Think about it this way: each new learning experience physically changes your brain, new neural connections and pathways are created, while pathways that are no longer in use die.  It is in our power to make fundamental changes in the human vision of the surrounding world, perception of oneself and even in the genes passed on to future generations ‚Äî all this can be achieved through experience that we can create for it. <br><br><h4>  And we recommend a seminar. </h4><br>  <i>Or an online training course.</i> <i><br><br></i>  <i>Or a package consisting of an online course and seminars.</i> <br><br>  Seriously?  Sorry, but there are better options. <br><br>  So, I do not call for all of us to stop doing what we did before, and to sign up for massage courses together, I‚Äôm just trying to say the following: in training and development in all sectors of the economy, we should ask ourselves how create environments and jobs where people can learn how to be good.  Ethical.  Cheerful.  Compassionate.  Brave  Not just to know the values ‚Äã‚Äãof the organization, but also to know what our values ‚Äã‚Äãare based on, which gives us satisfaction and fills us with pride.  Right? <br><br>  Once I read the following words in the <a href="http://theroadtocharacter.com/">book</a> ‚ÄúThe Road to Character‚Äù (The Road To Character): <br><br><blockquote>  "The heart cannot be trained through intellectual work in the classroom with mechanical note taking ... Good, wise hearts are created throughout life thanks to the diligent efforts of a deep knowledge of the essence and healing of scars ... you cannot teach it, send it by mail or describe it in tweet." </blockquote><br>  ... But you can create an organization or culture that cultivates good people.  And those people who represent the most honorable occupation associated with the training of other people should take an active part in creating such a culture. <br><br>  So, I will do my best to have meaningful discussions about training again and again in the hope that one day the solution will go without online courses, seminars and everything that is gamified or has a devastating effect on the industry.  And a new system of education will appear sooner or later, because one day a person working in a position, in the title of which there is the word ‚Äútraining,‚Äù dares to swim against the current, building this system from the inside, rather than creating it from the outside. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/294240/">https://habr.com/ru/post/294240/</a></p>
