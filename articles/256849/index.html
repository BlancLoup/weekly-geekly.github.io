Migration Chronicles</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  <i>SAFEDATA data centers will not prevent abnormal situations.</i>  <i>They are designed to function in virtually any environment.</i> <br><br>  Data processing centers are the main activity of SAFEDATA, the operator of its own distributed network of data centers and IT outsourcing service provider.  The SAFEDATA group, which today includes the Data Storage Center, the Virtualization Technology Center, the CDN operator NGENIX and the operator of the traffic exchange platform MSK-IX, owns a network of data centers built in accordance with the requirements of international standards TIA-942 (TIER III).  Our company is the only player in the market that combines businesses in three main segments - data center, traffic exchange and content delivery. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/047/6d4/931/0476d493160d4d1c93317f6f8a2851b6.png"></div><br>  <i>Network data centers SAFEDATA.</i>  <i>Network infrastructure and power supply are reserved on the N + 1 principle.</i>  <i>SAFEDATA data centers have connections to the MMTS-9 and MMTS-10, as well as to the MSK-IX traffic exchange points.</i> <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  The data center "Moscow-I" has two independent power inputs.  Uninterruptible power supply is provided by four Emerson Network Power UPSs of 800 kVA each, four FG Wilson diesel generator sets of 1250 kVA with battery life without refueling for up to eight hours.  Power distribution systems are based on Schneider Electric equipment.  The precision air conditioning system is designed to separate cold and hot air currents and uses Hiref cabinet air conditioners and Geoclima chillers.  This equipment is reserved under the N + 1 scheme.  The data center has been operating without interruption for more than seven years.

      The Moscow-II data center is also powered by two independent power inputs.  It uses eight diesel-rotary uninterruptible power supplies Hitec Power Protection for 1680 kVA.  UPS battery life is at least 20 hours.  For increased reliability, they are reserved according to the N + 1 scheme.  Data center power distribution systems are built on Schneider Electric equipment.  Hiref precision air conditioners, Guntner external condensing units, and a cold and hot air separation system ensure that the climatic conditions required for IT equipment are maintained.  The entire air conditioning system is reserved under the scheme N + 1. <br><br>  In both data centers, a fire extinguishing system based on the gas mixture Freon 227, a mobile smoke removal system, is used.  Protected premises and territory, organizational procedures for controlling access to the data center, the delimitation of physical access on the basis of proximity-cards, the video surveillance system inside and outside the data center ensure physical security and access delimitation. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/b63/36f/f56/b6336ff5674b49d78ed8f3813406cfae.png"></div><br>  <i>Data centers "Moscow-I" and "Moscow-II".</i> <br><br>  " <a href="http://www.computerra.ru/98626/safedata-moskva-2/">Moscow-II</a> " ranks second in the ranking of the largest data centers by the number of commissioned in 2013-2014.  stand-ups compiled by CNews Analytics.  SAFEDATA provides services for the placement, maintenance and rental of IT resources (rent racks, hosting, rental of dedicated and virtual servers, data storage services), <a href="http://safedata.ru/services/clouds/">cloud services IaaS and SaaS</a> , as well as services of communication channels and Internet access, protection from DDoS- attacks. <br><br>  The requirements of reliability and security of data center SAFEDATA pays special attention.  The company's data centers belong to the category of data storage and processing centers with a secure network infrastructure and are designed to serve customers with high demands on the reliability of equipment, bandwidth and data protection.  In April 2015, the company received a certificate of the Information Security Management System - ISO / IEC 27001: 2013, which confirms full compliance with the requirements of the ISO / IEC 27001: 2013 standard for the information security management system regarding the process of hosting client server equipment in SAFEDATA data centers. <br><br>  In mid-January, Rostelecom, a telecoms operator, bought a controlling stake in <a href="http://safedata.ru/">SAFEDATA</a> .  Together with the SAFEDATA group, the operator plans further development of a network of storage and distribution of federal content, including a geographically distributed <a href="http://safedata.ru/datacenters/">data center</a> network, which integrates communication channels, traffic exchange points, content delivery systems, as well as network attack protection systems and traffic monitoring systems.  The experience of the companies belonging to the SAFEDATA group in combination with the federal coverage of Rostelecom will enable them to occupy a leading position in the field of IT infrastructure outsourcing, expand the range of cloud services for content providers and corporate clients. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/2e1/56e/7dc/2e156e7dce804bfda355dbdaef0a08bb.png"></div><br>  <i>SAFEDATA services on the basis of their own data centers cover a wide range of services demanded by clients - from equipment placement and providing physical and information security, backup and disaster recovery to IaaS and migration of services to the cloud.</i> <br><br>  SAFEDATA clients include large Russian and international companies and banks, system integrators and other companies using information technology in their operations. <br><br><h2>  <font color="#0094d2">Is it time to move?</font> </h2><br>  The issue of migration of IT infrastructure in a commercial data center today is of interest to many companies.  The benefits and advantages of such a step most clearly demonstrate real examples of such a "move."  Summarizing them, there are several reasons that encourage customers to this step. <br><br><ol><li>  Lack of reliability of its own data center that does not meet the requirements of the business.  For example, frequent power cuts. </li><li>  The impossibility of expanding the infrastructure due to the limitations on space and / or available capacity. </li><li>  The impossibility of reserving Internet channels due to the connection of additional operators.  For example, business centers often limit the choice of provider to tenants. </li><li>  Risks of the existing solution: lack of disaster recovery and insufficient physical security of the equipment, complex non-compliance with the requirements of TIER III, including power supply, cooling, fire extinguishing system, access control and maintenance in 24 * 7 mode. </li><li>  High capital costs and long periods of building your own data center. </li></ol><br>  And this is not a complete list.  The migration itself is usually preceded by a thorough analysis of the market by the customer, and the transfer process to the cloud infrastructure may involve large-scale work requiring the preparation of new infrastructure: comprehensive testing, creating backup copies, providing the possibility of horizontal scaling and integration of the infrastructure into the SAFEDATA services system.  But even in this case, the move can be made without stopping the client's services. <br><br>  For example, a large IT company that provides customers with a large number of online services has thus got rid of the problems of frequent power cuts, the impossibility of expanding the infrastructure, and dependence on telecom operators present in the business center.  After moving its IT infrastructure to the SAFEDATA data center, the customer received guaranteed power supply via two independent power inputs, which ensures uninterrupted operation of IT systems.  In addition, it became possible to reserve Internet channels and expand the IT infrastructure by renting additional space to house equipment. <br><br>  A large retailer as a result of migration to the data center SAFEDATA ensured the absence of a single point of failure at all levels of service, many times reduced scaling time (changes in the resource pool) - it decreased to one day.  There was a possibility of flexible intensive development of the IT infrastructure and launching additional services, fine tuning the size of the infrastructure to the amount of resources consumed.  In addition, the risks have decreased, since the SAFEDATA data center meets the requirements of TIER III and is built in accordance with the international standard TIA-942. <br><br>  A commercial bank chose the option of renting a SAFEDATA data center, considering the cost of work and services compared to the organization of its own site.  This option met a variety of bank requirements, including detailing the cost of installation, connecting and renting each rack, as well as reserving space for racks, ensuring uninterrupted (24x7) equipment, providing redundant uninterrupted power supply, controlling access to bank equipment, video surveillance, security and fire alarm system, the presence of a fire extinguishing system, round-the-clock staff duty, and even a separate cable channel system (a separate cable channel to the power supply cables,  a separate channel for information cables, with optical and copper separated by a partition or laid in different channels).  Migration was carried out with minimal downtime and without stopping critical business processes.  At the appointed time, the equipment was dismantled, transported to the data center, installed in racks, connected to the local network and SAN. <br><br><h2>  <font color="#0094d2">What does this give?</font> </h2><br>  As a result of this migration, customers receive new benefits and growth drivers.  Moving to the <abbr title="Commercial Data Center">KCND</abbr> , as a rule, provides for reducing costs or more efficient cost control, getting access to IT resources in a short time and freeing up own resources, improving business efficiency and focusing on core activities, quickly entering new markets, reducing project implementation time and getting access to IT management expertise in the absence of own staff. <br><br>  SAFEDATA data center guarantees guaranteed security and uninterrupted work of data centers, presence of leading telecom operators at the sites, systems maintenance and service, service and efficiency (personal account manager, ServiceDesk), quick start of customer projects, comfortable financial burden and cost optimization, also monitoring and maintenance of all life support systems of data centers in 24x7x365 mode.  All data centers are staffed by SAFEDATA specialists who are always ready to carry out maintenance, configuration and configuration work on the customer‚Äôs systems.  More than 19 telecom operators and own fiber-optic lines provide the ability to connect any telecom operator. <br><br>  The data center uses professional fencing structures, modern access control and video surveillance systems.  Compliance with the requirements of FZ-152 and PCI DSS is provided.  If necessary, disaster-proof solutions can be created in distributed data centers.  ‚ÄúMy Account‚Äù provides customers with tools for managing and monitoring cloud services.  This makes it possible to receive IT resources ‚Äúon demand‚Äù at the right time and in the necessary volumes.  Russian companies and organizations are beginning to not only theoretically understand the advantages of commercial data centers, but also to extract them in practice.  The increasing number of success stories of the cloud IT consumption model contributes to a further increase in the number of customers interested in such services. <br><br>  We will be grateful if you write in the comments what you would be interested to learn about our company. <br>  Thank you for your attention, we will be happy to answer your questions. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/256849/">https://habr.com/ru/post/256849/</a></p>
