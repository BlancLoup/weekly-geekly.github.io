I want to tell you how PR is our advertising agency Red Keds.  More precisely, here are described several tasks to the PR managers of the company, who come and go. <br><br>  First you need to say a few words about our company.  We exist for 6 years with a tail.  We are mainly engaged in inventing ideas, copywriting and design.  Well, we also implement our own ideas in advertising on television, in the press, on the Internet.  Even such agencies as ours are called "communication".  That is, we are responsible for communicating the brand with consumers.  This is our specificity, from which the tasks for PR arise. <br><br>  Many may say that PR is wrong, dishonest and ugly.  And someone will say it's dirty.  And I agree and bring this picture as proof:

For example, it infuriates me when there is nothing behind informational reasons.  ‚ÄúThe director of our wonderful company went to a business lunch where he met with an accountant and they ate well.‚Äù This was just an example of bad PR. <br><br>  A good PR for a design studio or agency like us is when we tell the professional public what we have done.  How we did it, why, what ideas came to our mind and why we did it.  What results we got.  This is a good PR. <br><br>  We have long been in our company arguing about what is worth PR and what is not worth it.  During my work I had my own opinion that I needed to tell about all the projects.  You tell me what bad work is like?  And bad work also needs to be shown.  It has goals: <br>  - you show the market that you are alive and in full swing, <br>  - you get a slap in the face and this knocks you off snobbery and arrogance, <br>  - you get feedback that helps you get better. <br><br>  All these actions boil down to several goals: finding new customers, finding new employees, finding new partnerships, and a little refreshing vanity. <br><br>  We have a relatively small channel base where we send our news.  These are associations, news sites, design portals, etc. <br>  AIA <br>  AIR <br>  RMA <br>  composition.ru <br>  design collector <br>  illustrators.ru <br>  Lenta.ru <br>  social media club <br>  advertology <br>  adindex <br>  e-xecuitive <br>  Wordshop <br>  Idea <br>  Free-lance <br>  Cms - magazine <br>  Stock <br>  ADCR <br>  ACAR <br>  Popsop <br>  Interfax <br>  Apostol media <br>  cossa.ru <br><br>  Next, I present a list of tasks for PR managers and goals to be achieved.  This list we have in the form of a document that allows you to adhere to a given strategy in public relations, as well as to monitor the work of a PR man and evaluate the results. <br><br>  <b>MANIFESTO</b> <br>  Many believe that in advertising there is no place for humanism and honesty.  But few people understand that besides the goals of selling goods, advertising is multifaceted in terms of creation and ideology.  Copywriters, designers, artists, musicians, actors, photographers try to embody in advertising not only the correct selling images, but to bring creativity and art into it and invest their own talent in advertising.  Thanks to the creativity of these people, the advertising ideology does not end with the demonstration of goods and services, the urge to action and engagement in interactive communication.  The ideology of advertising can carry the social mission of transmitting human emotions, conveying a lifestyle, conveying to people the values ‚Äã‚Äãthat the advertiser shares with his audience.  As an advertising agency, we are obliged not only to help create advertising, but also to send advertisers to the necessary social direction.  To make clear the responsibility for the social order of human life. <br>  In addition to the business model of the creative agency, Red Keds seeks to create its own creative projects and support other people's interesting ideas. <br><br>  <b>MISSION</b> <br>  Serving the humanistic ideals of mankind and creative creation <br><br>  <b>GOALS</b> <br>  ‚Ä¢ Achievement of the reputation of the agency as a creative agency, ideas developers <br>  ‚Ä¢ Strengthening business reputation <br>  ‚Ä¢ Attracting potential customers <br>  ‚Ä¢ Increase in initial hits <br>  ‚Ä¢ Improved agency awareness rating <br><br>  <b>TASKS</b> <br>  ‚Ä¢ Creation and publication of informational motives <br>  ‚Ä¢ Organization of events <br>  ‚Ä¢ Increase traffic to redkeds.com with useful and interesting content. <br>  ‚Ä¢ Increase in initial publications and agency references in blogs and social networks (relevant content) <br>  ‚Ä¢ Participation in advertising festivals, competitions, ratings <br>  ‚Ä¢ Speeches at seminars, conferences, festivals <br>  ‚Ä¢ Conducting educational activities <br><br>  <b>POSITIONING</b> <br>  ‚Ä¢ Red Keds is a creative agency that is engaged in inventing, developing and implementing advertising campaigns of various formats. <br>  ‚Ä¢ Red Keds - a team of professionals, with an informal attitude, a special atmosphere, with a good sense of humor (ha ha ha there and all that) <br>  ‚Ä¢ Red Keds - is the experience in advertising and digital, which they gladly share <br><br>  Red Keds adheres to the concept of "transparency and openness."
