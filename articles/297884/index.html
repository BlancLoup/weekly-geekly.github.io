  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Cloud technologies, personnel management and forecasting - the main trends of 2016</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/b02/68d/dfe/b0268ddfe05f4e35b068704e4ea1fe79.jpg" alt="image" align="left">  A period of unpredictability is the best time for the IT industry.  It often happens that the most innovative technologies develop from the most unexpected and unattractive undertakings.  Contenders for the role of revolutionary companies appear so often that they are going to the queue.  However, few manage to change the existing order of things.  And when this happens, we are again convinced that the market situation can change very quickly, and, as a rule, without special warnings.  This is exactly what makes the IT sector such an exciting field of activity and helps many of us get up early in the morning and go to work. <br><br>  On the one hand, an attempt to predict the future may seem a futile venture.  On the other hand, to resist the desire to keep your nose in the wind and understand where this wind is blowing is simply impossible.  The speed with which innovations occur convinces us again and again that organizations that fail to follow the latest news in their field of activity put themselves at serious risk.  Being at the forefront of technology development means following them and anticipating trends, while being able, at the same time, to benefit from the use of the latest tools and technologies offered by the market. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Despite the inability to make detailed forecasts, we, nevertheless, can say with confidence that in 2016 companies will continue to use the full potential of information technology for growth and development. <br><br><h3>  Pedal to the floor: acceleration due to cloud computing </h3><br>  Today, the victory of cloud technologies is obvious, but just some two years ago, the application of such solutions should have been discussed at an early stage of the deal, and the desire to transfer some aspects of doing business to the cloud would be met with alarm or even resistance.  Now the use of cloud technologies is becoming a typical solution.  And if 2015 can be called the year of universal recognition of cloud technologies, then 2016 will be the year of their continuous growth.  This means that we can expect an acceleration of the distribution of the ‚ÄúX as a service‚Äù model.  Today, when the need for such a transition is obvious, no one wants to look back.

      Another point is the constant changes in the legislation on the storage and transfer of personal information, including concerns about the recent <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Safe_Harbor_Privacy_Principles">decision of the European Court</a> to annul reservations about the transfer of personal information outside the European Union.  Tightening requirements in this area may soon lead to the fact that organizations will no longer cope with their satisfaction and will not be able to properly update their IT infrastructure.  In this regard, the transition to the cloud can be a safe alternative for international companies - delegating responsibility for meeting the requirements of a regulator to a third party can be a reasonable way out of this situation. <br><br><h3>  Cloud management - a new challenge for business </h3><br>  For business, widespread acceptance of cloud technology means the emergence of new business challenges.  Now organizations will not have to think about how to implement this or that cloud infrastructure, but how to learn how to effectively manage it.  They will have to determine where the ‚Äúcloud begins‚Äù and where it ends. <br><br>  In 2016, concerns about the quality of management of the information environment will be heard more and more often, to the point that they will become the main topic at the meetings.  A wide choice of suppliers, a variety of options and ease of access for all types of business will make it difficult to assess how efficiently the company's IT department makes decisions and whether it manages to keep information in order.  Given the huge number of new applications and services, organizations risk appearing on the ‚ÄúWild West of cloud solutions‚Äù, and their IT departments will have to do a difficult job of monitoring the expanded infrastructure. <br><br><h3>  Looking into the crystal ball: businessmen will be able to win, able to predict the future </h3><br>  Data analysis helps companies discover and highlight valuable information from a data set, but current business intelligence tools can only evaluate past or present actions.  Companies will strive to implement tools that allow them to ‚Äúlook into the future‚Äù, model test scenarios, and evaluate the implications of using them on real data, from forecasting sales to estimating the cost of hiring new employees. <br><br>  It is companies that focus on predicting the future will succeed in the next few years.  They will no longer rely on fast-growing information and will plan activities based on a flexible and easily changeable strategy that will help them achieve their goals in the next 5, 10 or 20 years. <br><br><h3>  Harmony within the company will determine everything. </h3><br>  For a company, the ability to quickly and correctly respond to a situation is key.  Modern business culture does not tolerate delays, so a good reaction rate to changes is the main requirement for companies.  And, of course, the more information it has, the more detailed and effective planning can be. <br><br>  Despite the understanding of these issues, most companies today operate in a state of internal disunity, without having a complete picture of how related internal units are connected.  However, as long as the information comes from disparate sources, it is not possible to get a holistic understanding of how the organization works.  Knowing how departments work together affects them and how it affects the company's performance is key.  Therefore, throughout the year we will see that companies are paying increased attention to the integration of business processes. <br><br><h3>  Business factor: the importance of effective work with the staff will grow </h3><br>  The working staff is one of the main sources of the company's expenses.  He is her most important asset.  In this regard, the ability of human resources specialists to interact with colleagues from other departments to solve problems of personnel optimization or shortages of qualifications will have a direct impact on the result of the company‚Äôs work and its potential income. <br><br>  Now personnel departments are only cost-centers, without which it is impossible.  They perform the functions of hiring employees and act for them as a guarantor of compliance with acceptable working conditions.  This year we will see how HR professionals are reorganizing their systems and processes in order to become a strategically significant part of the business, especially in terms of HR planning.  According to their special function within the company, these specialists will work closely with the management of the company and the board of directors in order to closely monitor the state of the organization.  Having real-time access to the data of the entire organization and using such tools as hiring, retraining and temporary recruitment, they can instantly influence any aspect of the company‚Äôs activities. <br><br>  <i>Translation prepared specifically for the corporate blog PayOnline.</i>  <i>If you are looking for the best payment solution for your site, <a href="http://payonline.ru/%3Futm_source%3Dmegamozg%26utm_medium%3Dreferral%26utm_campaign%3Dwebpayments-main">please contact</a> our experts to help you with this.</i> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/297884/">https://habr.com/ru/post/297884/</a></p>
