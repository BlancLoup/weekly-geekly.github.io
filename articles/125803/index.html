    <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  I learned about the campaign from Facebook and Twitter about 3 weeks ago, read where they would be cleaned, but none of the places touched me, firstly far, secondly I wasn‚Äôt there.  To go or not to go the question was not, the weekend of August 6th was free, I have no children, especially the family, and the matter is necessary.  I wrote a letter to Marina Asadcheva, who oversaw the cleaning in Moscow and the region.  She suggested not to be afraid and ‚Äúcreate‚Äù her own cleaning in her area. <br><br>  The idea of ‚Äã‚Äãcourse delivered some discomfort, but I did not see any risk.  Filled out an application, provided the necessary data, wrote to friends-acquaintances and waited. <br><br>  A week before the cleaning, they began to receive calls about participation and questions.  A flurry of calls and letters fell on Friday, letters came even at 2 am.  I will quote one of them: <br>  <i>Hello!</i>  <i>Can I take part in the campaign "bloggers against garbage"?</i>  <i>My friend and I would like to participate, but we don‚Äôt know whether it is possible without prior agreement.</i>  <i>I warn you that if you do not answer me, we will still come;)</i> <br><br>  Well, how can you refuse to such a letter :) <br><br>  Total enrolled about 30 people.  On Friday, the curators of all cleanings gathered for props <br><br><img src="http://gtoday.ru/images/antimusor/punkt.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Where, the aforementioned, Marina Asadcheva gave out T-shirts, mittens, bags of several kinds, a first-aid kit (thank God, we didn‚Äôt need it, water, signs (an example in the title photo), etc. <br><br>  Now about the cleaning itself. <br>  The people pulled up at 11 o'clock in the morning, at 11:20 we began to clean up the slope under the observation deck and the forest park.  Garbage there - corks from champagne, bottles from water, beer, covers from drinks, sea cigarette butts, paper and so on.  In the forest park, we even managed to find a full-size fire extinguisher.  o_O <br><br>  The people looked at us in different ways, someone thought that we were from ‚ÄúOurs‚Äù or another organization, someone said - ‚ÄúOh, Sobyanin is trying,‚Äù and some were throwing new traffic jams on the newly cleaned territory. <br><br>  In total, we were 17 people, age from 17 years to ¬± 30.  I did not know any of these people before that, quite by chance, after cleaning, it turned out that one of the Yandex employees who came (I‚Äôm a Mail.Ru employee in the past) and we had something to discuss) <br><br><img src="http://gtoday.ru/images/antimusor/people.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Together we gathered not so much - only about 25 bags of garbage.  25!  And how many more there ... We cleaned a little more than 3 hours.  One of the girls was generally from France, which surprised me.  She barely spoke Russian, but she was actively involved in cleaning OUR trash. <br><br>  For good it is necessary to parachute in the amount of 50-100 people, and just fine everything is removed.  1 day, in the sun, nature, there is where to drive then to football.  And I thought, there is a Habr, perhaps people who do not give a damn there can be found in the amount of 50 people. <br><br>  What I did not like <br>  The idea itself is really awesome, but the abundance of brands that have ‚Äústuck‚Äù to it is a bit scary.  Almost everyone agreed with this.  I will not do advertising to anyone here, and maybe I'm wrong, but there is an opinion. <br><br>  Thanks for attention. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/125803/">https://habr.com/ru/post/125803/</a></p>
