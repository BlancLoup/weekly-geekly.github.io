Probably, every experienced developer living in a provincial town has thoughts of moving to another city, where the IT sphere is most developed.  It was the same with me ... I had a choice between St. Petersburg and Moscow, after the first trip to St. Petersburg the first option was dropped by itself - the city just didn‚Äôt like it.  But in terms of the choice of the city - everything is individual, who likes what more.  I chose the capital for a possible move during the year.

        </script>
      <br>
      After I decided on the city, I began to search for interesting offers.  By experience, I will say that it is worth looking first of all on HH, as well as on My Circle, you should not forget about pruffi.  From the experience of communicating with companies in the process, I realized that I could not do without face-to-face interviews, although some go on Skype interviews followed by in-person interviews. <br><br>  I allocated 3 full days for face-to-face interviews - this is more than enough.  In one day, there are actually 3 interviews, but no more than that, because  usually the interview takes about 1.5-2 hours. <br><br>  As a result, for one company I did a test task (1-2 days), with about 2-3 I had a Skype interview.  Agreeing on a Skype interview is very important, from my point of view, on it you can immediately understand whether we are suitable for each other and save a lot of time. <br><br>  After about a week or two, I had about 8 invitations for face-to-face interviews that suited me and the offers were very interesting. <br><br><h4>  About preparation </h4><br>  In the process of Skype interviews, you can roughly analyze the gaps in knowledge and compensate them before the face-to-face interview, while there is time. <br>  First of all, I recommend refreshing the design and OOP patterns in my memory - it is useless to go for interviews without deep knowledge of this topic.  By preparation I recommend two books: <br><ul><li>  Object-oriented design techniques.  Design patterns, E. Gamma, R. Helm, R. Johnson, J. Vlissides.  (in life - a gang of four) </li><li>  PHP  Objects, Patterns, and Programming Techniques, Matt Zandstra </li></ul>  I sorted out about 15-20 patterns, but in reality they ask about the main ones.  Here are the ones that I was precisely asked about: <br><ol><li>  Generators: Singleton, Factory method, Abstract Factory, Builder </li><li>  Structural: Composite, Decorator, Facade, Adapter </li><li>  Behavioral: Strategy </li></ol>  and you need to be able to compare, to understand how they differ from each other, to imagine how to implement.  Implementation code to keep in mind there is no need. <br><br>  Depending on the vacancy you are applying for, they ask questions about * nix teams, how to do certain things (they asked about 2 interviews).  In some companies, the leading PHP programmers play the role of both the administrator and the application architect and the database and front-end designer, one company had exactly this :) <br><br>  The main questions that are asked can be found in Habr√©: <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/php/67963/">here</a> and <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/php/21681/">here</a> - be sure to look, if there are gaps - be sure to disassemble. <br>  Practically at each interview there are questions about comparison and type conversion in PHP, for example, you need to understand and explain what will happen as a result of such comparisons: <br><ol><li>  '1top' == 1 </li><li>  '0tw0111' == a (where "a" is an indefinite constant) </li></ol>  etc‚Ä¶ <br>  Also, almost always there are questions on the knowledge of new versions of PHP, what's new in them, etc.  Very often there is a task with cloning objects, like in PHP 4 and PHP 5. <br><br>  I note that there were no logic tasks anywhere, but it seems to me that such companies still exist :) <br><br>  As for the DB.  If you are applying for a project with MySQL, then you are sure to be asked about the types of tables and their differences, as well as what indexes are, how they are arranged and which ones are.  You will be asked to write a SQL query, where, almost certainly, there will be JOIN, HAVING, GROUP BY. <br><br>  Now most of the serious vacancies found item HighLoad.  Here you will almost certainly be asked about the methods you will use to optimize the project under high loads.  Once they asked about the accelerators their features and how they work. <br><br>  The criteria by which I ‚Äúevaluated‚Äù the sentences: <br><ul><li>  The professionalism of the team. </li><li>  Interest in the future project, which will need to work. </li><li>  Soc.  buns, for example, the presence of LCA. </li><li>  Interest in the frame of the employer. </li><li>  Workplace. </li></ul>  As a result of the interviews, as it turned out, I went through all the vacancies where I went.  It only remained to choose the most suitable option, which I did without hesitation :) <br><br><h4>  Features of Moscow </h4><br>  At the request, a little about Moscow and its features. <br>  Prices: <ol><li>  Prices for food are like everywhere else and even cheaper if you buy in cheap supermarkets such as Auchan and Pyaterochka </li><li>  With clothes, things are the same as with food :) everything is available in the same Mega </li></ol>  Apartments: <ol><li>  You can always look at offers on the site cian.ru, realtors work mainly with him.  But it‚Äôs not a fact that you can get through to these phones yourself. </li><li>  Finding an apartment you are interested in will most likely take you no more than a week. </li><li>  With animals denied in 90% of cases </li><li>  In Moscow, when renting it is necessary to pay: for 1 month to the owner + for 1 month as a deposit (or for the last month), this amount is later given upon eviction + for 1 month to the realtor.  Those.  in the end, when renting, you need to immediately give a triple price.  As they say in the comments, the price of the work of a realtor really bring down to 50%. </li><li>  I recommend the northwest for renting an apartment.  There are many nice green areas. </li><li>  Prices: good odnushka 27-30.  In dvushkah and above - not savvy, I can not say anything exact. </li></ol>  PS If you have questions, I will be happy to answer them.  Perhaps not all the moments in detail illuminated. <br><br>  <b>UPD.:</b> Added some more questions that I remembered + told about the features of rent and prices in Moscow. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/126250/">https://habr.com/ru/post/126250/</a></p>
