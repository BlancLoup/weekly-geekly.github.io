For those who do not vkurse, or forgot, some information. <br><br><blockquote>  <b>Scene</b> is a web series created by Jun Group Entertainment in 2004-2006.  The first of its kind movie action which takes place on the screen of his heroes' computers, where we see how they communicate in the chat. <br><br>  Heroes of the Scene are members of the fictional release group CPX, which distributes novelty films before their official release.  The plot of the story begins with the fact that one of the founders of the group under the pressure of circumstances sells a copy of the film to Asian DVD pirates. <br></blockquote><br>  Recently, I came across this series on rutreker, thinking that he was transferred with subtitles or voice as many other shows.  But everything turned out to be much more interesting: the user under the <b>ID ID-Daemon with</b> incredible efforts for six months, managed to draw the first series almost manually.  At the moment, 12 out of 20 episodes of the first of two seasons are completely Russified.

      <b>The Russian version of the show is provided with a complete replacement of the animation and synchronization of dialogs in chat rooms, the text of letters, and some key parts of the Windows XP interface.</b>  Speech was also fully voiced. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/6f5/e5b/f8b/6f5e5bf8b7cb0e3b647d14bd5c211c58.png"><br><br>  Under the cut there are links to distributions, Review, Soundtrack, as well as the full user <b>ID-Daemon</b> story associated with this series, with which he accompanies his releases, in an attempt to popularize this is not a standard show for ordinary people and get the right to publish the series in the <b>TV Series</b> section.  At the moment, the show is located in the branch <b>Rutracker.org ¬ªMiscellaneous¬ª Miscellaneous ¬ªVideo</b> <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/dcd/a8e/de5/dcda8ede52ab34fb166179340117127e.png"><br><h5>  How I learned about the show </h5><br><br>  In the fall of 2010, I was going to translate an article about Shane Pitman, the leader of the release group of Razor1911, one of the most famous groups that played the games that released Quake before the official release.  This is a rather long and interesting article about how he was on the scene, how he was arrested, and how his life was formed after that. <br>  In this regard, I read various articles on Wikipedia, about the cutting scene, about groups, about the FBI operations that were conducted against them in different years, including stumbled upon an article about the operation ‚ÄúSite Down‚Äù: <br>  <a href="http://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%259E%25D0%25BF%25D0%25B5%25D1%25...%25D1%258F_Site_Down">ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D0%9E%D0%BF%D0%B5%D1%...%D1%8F_Site_Down</a> <br>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Site_Down">en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Site_Down</a> <br>  In the Russian version there is no such thing, but in the English version there is a strange similarity between the real events of 2005 and the series ‚Äúscene‚Äù.  That's how I found out about him.  I downloaded it, started watching and was simply mesmerized by it. <br><br><h5>  Unusual format </h5><br>  In Russia, only a few could see the ‚Äúscene‚Äù, who not only by some miracle learned about the series, but also knew English and slang well enough to sort out an incredibly twisted detective story. <br><br>  The atmosphere makes an indelible impression.  I watched what was happening on the computer screen, listened to the sound of keys, the music that the character was listening to.  I saw what we used to do today every day, and no longer notice how it looks.  I seemed to be in the place of the heroes of the film.  Sometimes instinctively I wanted to move a window with a mouse or close it.  Especially unusual feeling, when I myself while watching someone wrote in ICQ or had something to watch on the Internet.  My virtual life was intermingled with the events of the film, and from this the events became even more mysterious.  For a week, I slowly looked at all 20 episodes. <br><br>  I immediately thought that it would be nice to translate it so that those who do not know English could also watch, the series was clearly worth it.  But how to do that?  The fact is that in this first-of-its-kind movie, the action takes place on the screen of his heroes' computers, where we see how they communicate in a chat.  Subtitles would only confuse the viewer, the screen is already overloaded with text, sometimes changing simultaneously in different windows.  The off-screen translation would not be suitable either, even if it was multi-voiced, it would be difficult to understand which line is pronounced by someone.  It seems the only option was to redraw the English letters into Russians, that is, in fact, completely redoing the video.  But I did not know how to do it. <br><br><h5>  Long 1.5 years of searching </h5><br>  About a week later I talked about a ‚Äúscene‚Äù to a friend, and it turned out that there is a person who can try to draw letters, as he had already done this before, sometimes inserting text into a video, Russifying individual inscriptions or words to a song.  The volume of work was certainly incomparable, but we decided to try. <br>  At the cost of incredible efforts, in the course of half a year we managed to draw a series almost manually and it was uploaded to the root-tracker.  The distribution was immediately closed due to non-standard technical parameters. <br><br>  After negotiations with the moderators, the series was still allowed to be distributed, but not in the TV section, but in the ‚ÄúMiscellaneous‚Äù section, which I hadn‚Äôt even heard of before.  I don‚Äôt know how anyone, but if I want to watch a movie, I‚Äôm looking in the ‚Äúmovies‚Äù section, the series in the ‚ÄúTV series‚Äù section, and music in the ‚Äúmusic‚Äù section.  I thought that hardly anyone would notice in the ‚Äúdifferent‚Äù series.  But since it is still difficult to evaluate the whole picture from series 1, I decided that later, when more episodes were ready, I could ask to return the distribution to the series. <br><br>  We started making 2 episodes.  As time went on, it soon became clear that in this way we would translate the entire series in 10 years ... For six months, only a few units downloaded it, it still remained in complete obscurity.  It seemed that everything is lost, we will never finish the translation, and even if we finish it, no one will see it anyway. <br><br>  So it has been almost 10 months.  In the spring of 2012, again, by chance, I met a few more people who remembered this series, and they also wanted to help in the translation.  Maybe we were lucky, maybe it was a regularity, but suddenly several excellent ideas arose, a special program was written that partially automated the process of drawing letters, and as a result, the 2nd series was completed in just a week! <br><br><h5>  Review (Zoe Blade) </h5><br>  Remember the 1995 film Hackers?  I am one of those people who have watched it a dozen times and yet I don‚Äôt like it.  I think the reason is that I don‚Äôt particularly like metaphors, especially in such literal content as film.  Although most viewers may not mind the mathematical symbols flying around someone's head, like the presentation of how they idealize computer code, I would prefer to see how a character, say, exploited a vulnerability in the SSH version that is set to server (as the Wachowski brothers did in 2003 in The Matrix - Reboot).  No matter how you try to make hacking look glamorous, the fact remains that hackers spend most of their time staring at text lines on a flat screen. <br><br>  Good or bad, but the ‚Äúscene‚Äù is the first film that is not just made about Internet pirates, it actually looks like it was made for people from the computer community.  Almost all dialogues have the form of text on a computer screen, namely in IRC channels and instant messaging clients, with the exception of rare phone calls and face-to-face conversations.  The live video itself is shown in a window that takes up less than a quarter of the screen.  In fact, you do not so much watch the show, as you read it. <br><br>  Despite how boring it may sound, The Scene is an interesting idea that is surprisingly well implemented.  Yes, he has a budget, in comparison with which the ‚ÄúClerks‚Äù look epic, but this only gives a sharpness of realism, comparable to the ‚ÄúWitch of Blair‚Äù or Cloverfield.  However, unlike the Blair Witch, the script is written skillfully enough to be drawn into a story full of intrigue, forcing you to launch a torrent client and download each new episode.  The lack of budget is made up by drawing the characters, the plot, and the novelty of both the format and the use of the Creative Commons license. <br><br>  The story itself is quite attractive.  It is about a group of people who have never met in real life, but nevertheless, are in constant contact in order to release illegal copies of Hollywood films on the Internet.  Such dubious characters obviously have plenty of opportunity for conflict, and the creator of the show, Mitchell Reichgut, of course uses this fact.  They are self-confident, full of lies and paranoia, and at the same time true friends.  And of course there are reasons for paranoia - some of them may turn out to be completely not the ones for whom they claim to be. <br><br>  Scene proves (at least to those who like it, including me) that a good script is much more important than a big budget.  And most importantly, it gives hope to anyone who would like to create, or simply find an exciting show, licensed through Creative Commons.  It must be admitted, as long as no TV channel of course makes competition wary, but this is definitely a step in the right direction. <br>  This is how Internet TV should be: try new ideas.  I think it is safe to say that this idea was a success.  I would recommend the ‚Äúscene‚Äù to people who know how to download it, this has a definite meaning.  It was specially made for this new distribution channel, not only as a means of distribution, but also in content.  If you have ever watched a movie or a series that was downloaded from the Internet, this movie is ‚Äúmust watch‚Äù for you. <br><br><h5>  Articles and discussions on foreign forums and websites </h5><br>  <a href="http://www.heise.de/tp/r4/artikel/19/19785/1.html">Detailed article in the large German online edition of Heise</a> <br>  <a href="http://slashdot.org/article.pl%3Fsid%3D05/03/17/1322246">General discussion of the series, which began at the beginning of its release.</a> <br><br>  Discussing the connection with the actual arrest of the FBI on the scene, which began in the summer of 2005 <br>  <a href="http://www.slyck.com/forums/viewtopic.php%3Ff%3D31%26t%3D12404">www.slyck.com/forums/viewtopic.php?f=31&amp;t=12404</a> <br>  <a href="http://www.vcdq.com/forum/topic64311.html">www.vcdq.com/forum/topic64311.html</a> <br><br><h5>  Links </h5><br>  <a href="http://welcometothescene.com/">Official site</a> and <a href="http://thescene.gulli.com/">mirror</a> in Germany. <br><br>  <b>OST:</b> <br>  <a href="">Maylynne-catch me</a> <br><br>  <b>The Scene on Rutracker</b> <br>  600p <a href="http://rutracker.org/forum/viewtopic.php%3Ft%3D3600572">rutracker.org/forum/viewtopic.php?t=3600572</a> <br>  720p <a href="http://rutracker.org/forum/viewtopic.php%3Ft%3D4064846">rutracker.org/forum/viewtopic.php?t=4064846</a> <br><br>  <b>The Scene Vkontakte</b> <br>  <a href="http://vk.com/the.scene">vk.com/the.scene</a> <br><br>  <b>PS:</b> I also contacted <b>ID-Daemon</b> with a desire to invite him into our community so that he could write good and fascinating articles, since he is so passionate about this topic. <br><br>  UPD: <b>ID Daemon is</b> voiced by a humorous series about Photoshop <br>  <a href="http://rutracker.org/forum/viewtopic.php%3Ft%3D4111039">Horseradish Photoshop / You Suck at Photoshop</a> <br>  <b>Horseradish Photoshoppers Vkontakte</b> <br>  vk.com/yousuckatphotoshop <br><br>  Have a great weekend watching The Scene. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/150239/">https://habr.com/ru/post/150239/</a></p>
