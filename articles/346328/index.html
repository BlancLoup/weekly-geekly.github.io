  <section class="page js-page"><h1>ITMO University Digest: the most interesting materials in our blog over the past year</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  In today's digest, we recall the popular materials of 2017, published in our blog on Habr√©: our own developments and projects of the University, useful materials for those entering ITMO, essays and stories about programming, tips for those who want to learn how to develop at home, a big cycle about working fast reading techniques and advice to those who read (and write) scientific articles - about all this in our compilation below. <br><br> <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/company/spbifmo/blog/346328/"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/dh/m5/-4/dhm5-47ichu1lzt2idyxvclhp6q.jpeg"></a> <a name="habracut"></a>  <i><font color="#A9A9A9">Photo <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/150684305%40N05/31303121384/">m1try</a> CC BY</font></i> <br><br><h2>  Projects and development of ITMO University </h2><br><ul><li>  <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/company/spbifmo/blog/340668/">Big data and machine learning: new opportunities for medicine</a> .  The market for medical technology using Big Data is growing in both the West and Russia.  In this material, we talk about what kind of developments of this kind are being conducted at ITMO University: from specific projects (modeling the operation of Ambulance cars in St. Petersburg) to educational programs such as computational biomedicine and chemoinformatics. </li></ul><br><ul><li>  <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/company/spbifmo/blog/325346/">ITMO University will begin developing unbreakable storage systems</a> .  Scientists at ITMO University have long been involved in quantum technology and have experience developing quantum communication systems.  As part of the new initiative, a team of specialists is working on the technology of an unbreakable and effectively managed data center - this project has no world analogues. </li></ul><br><ul><li>  <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/company/spbifmo/blog/319688/">Second Generation Cloud Computing: The CLAVIRE System</a> .  Scientists at ITMO University have long been involved in quantum technology and have experience developing quantum communication systems.  As part of the new initiative, a team of specialists is working on the technology of an unbreakable and effectively managed data center - this project has no world analogues. </li></ul><br><ul><li>  <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/company/spbifmo/blog/326644/">Scientists from ITMO University have proposed a new system for the transmission of energy over a distance</a> .  The ITMO University developed a prototype of a device for wireless energy transmission, which was based on dielectric resonator disks.  The efficiency of the technology reaches 90%, while it is consistent even if the relative position of the source and receiver changes.  The development not only competes with foreign counterparts, but also surpasses them in a number of parameters. </li></ul><br><ul><li>  <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/company/spbifmo/blog/333962/">‚ÄúKnow yourself‚Äù: social media mining-projects at ITMO University</a> .  We talk about which projects of students and employees of ITMO University use information from social networks: for more accurate profiling of potential buyers, predicting user behavior and even for analyzing emotions, allowing them to recognize and prevent the emergence of hotbeds of tension in crowded places. </li></ul><br><h2>  Useful reading </h2><br><ul><li>  <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/company/spbifmo/blog/331270/">Speed ‚Äã‚Äãreading: does it work or not?</a>  <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/company/spbifmo/blog/331270/">Part 1</a> .  This is the first material from our speed reading cycle.  In it we tell why speed reading is not reading, we explain the outstanding successes of scholars and argue about why you should not rely on this technique if you need to prepare for a difficult exam in an emergency mode. </li></ul><br><ul><li>  <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/company/spbifmo/blog/331662/">Speed ‚Äã‚Äãreading: does it work or not?</a>  <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/company/spbifmo/blog/331662/">Part 2: parsing techniques</a> .  We consider one of the most popular techniques used in teaching speed reading.  Reading ‚Äúdiagonally‚Äù, reading without stopping, suppressing sub-vocalization, RSVP ‚Äî which of these methods actually work and which ones are useless or even physiologically impossible?  About this in the second part of the cycle. </li></ul><br><ul><li>  <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/company/spbifmo/blog/331750/">Speed ‚Äã‚Äãreading: does it work or not?</a>  <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/company/spbifmo/blog/331750/">Part 3: simple tips</a> .  What should those who do not want to waste time learning speed reading methods do?  We talk about alternative techniques to improve the efficiency of reading, as well as the "slow reading."  And about situations where speed reading is really not enough. </li></ul><br><ul><li>  <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/company/spbifmo/blog/336672/">How to read scientific articles: advice from scientists</a> .  Reading the article does not mean understanding it.  Especially when it comes to scientific publication.  In this material we give practical advice on how to select and read scientific articles, analyze what such an article consists of and how to make the time spent on it pass as efficiently as possible.  And also we give the advice of scientists and editors of scientific journals - in general, those who regularly come across this type of publications. </li></ul><br><ul><li>  <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/company/spbifmo/blog/343320/">‚ÄúWithout further ado‚Äù: ‚Äã‚Äãthe shortest scientific articles</a> .  ‚ÄúA lot of time is spent on reading scientific articles‚Äù - even for this rule there is an exception.  We talk about the paradoxes of science: articles with a minimum number of words (and even without a single word at all).  About why they exist and what they give the scientific community - in this material. </li></ul><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/64f/2c0/583/64f2c0583fd14d29b357ebd5208d0fe1.jpg">  <i><font color="#A9A9A9">Photo by <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hackny/5605595796/in/photolist-9xm9ko-buRLHu-dQaoNa-fHtmH5-gufZmk-pmMYwo-cdyrGQ-aFQnH4-dfkMU3-nkBodU-bHLu96-aFQnpM-UH76cV-Qwj6Yh-dV9B2q-aFQodt-aFQpwt-ftm36m-8RcFUD-32ADwg-6WxtW8-aFQqBP-aFQnCV-fHtms1-9EoNcZ-Udjr3J-fHbGFZ-fHtjHA-fHtiTQ-fHbJFK-9EmEdB-fHtgAj-dgkczC-9EnUkx-ebpqu9-jZsM42-fQamwH-aFQnwF-aFQqhr-9Ep5Qo-aFQo5P-9FQnDZ-gufnRW-fHtktm-2sf6x8-8U5veB-fHti45-9xmb1N-9EoZgp-buzNK5">hackNY.org</a> CC BY</font></i>

Why do programmers need to constantly learn new things?  How do developers spend their free time: which languages ‚Äã‚Äãare used in their work, and which ones are used for their own projects?  When programming is used not as a goal, but as a learning tool?  All this in our material. </li></ul><br><ul><li>  <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/company/spbifmo/blog/324484/">A programmer without a diploma: what can and what can not give "home schooling" in IT</a> .
