  <section class="page js-page"><h1>About the supervision of employees - as it was with us</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Do you know what your employees do at work? <br><br>  Working as the head of the IT department in the company, I was engaged in absolutely all issues related to IT, about IT and even a little more.  I think you are all familiar when people call to IT support and complain that the cooler is not working.  Yes, yes, the one that cools the water.  When asked why they can call IT and not AXO, they cannot clearly answer, they just mumble something like ‚Äúwires, eletrichestvo‚Äù.  However, these problems worried me a little, even though sometimes they got it, they neighing inside the department, okay, there were a lot of tasks: budgets, servers, telephony, services and user assistance.  I would like to talk about them, about users.  Surely, everyone came across a resume of people who wrote something like ‚Äúexcellent MS Office skills‚Äù or something along the same lines, while at the workplace they call IT support to insert a table into a Word document ... Ok , it happens, we will help, we will teach ... And days go by, then the new service is readjusted, then people can be helped.  And seeing this level of users, they have to make any restrictions, the so-called ‚Äúfoolproof‚Äù - deny rights, prohibit deleting files on the ball, prohibit some sites. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/510/7fe/575/5107fe575bb74f4eb94a0d6664dd986a.jpg"><br>  <em>just a picture to attract attention.</em>  <em>In general, all the pictures in this article just to attract attention and are taken from the Internet.</em> <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Here it is necessary to make a digression and say that I myself do not like restrictions and very loyal to the Internet people.  I will not restrict access to anything in the workplace, hoping for the consciousness of workers.  And there is a historical explanation for this - I worked a lot in foreign companies and in companies with a high level of employee awareness.  And yes, in addition to consciousness, computer literacy was also present.  Here, knowing what computer skills one half of employees had, I was forced to create black lists on the firewall (ME), simply in order to save some users from viruses and temptations. 
      <br>
        <script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>
        <ins class="adsbygoogle"
          style="display:block; text-align:center;"
          data-ad-layout="in-article"
          data-ad-format="fluid"
          data-ad-client="ca-pub-6974184241884155"
          data-ad-slot="8945601208"></ins>
        <script>
          (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
        </script>
      <br>
      From time to time, I checked the logs of ME, checked how access, filtering works.  And, once, I began to check how filtering works not only on my actions, but also decided to look at the actions of other users.  Here, apparently, it is necessary to make another lyrical digression and tell you about the ‚ÄúPareto rule‚Äù 20/80.  In a nutshell, "20% of effort gives 80% of the result, and the remaining 80% of effort - only 20% of the result."  Details in Google, and if you roughly apply this rule to the company's employees, it turns out that only 20% of the employees work in the company. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/43a/3dd/293/43a3dd293f6049099ded99cf3cb44423.jpg"><br><br>  So, checking the logs, I began to look at requests to search engines.  Yes, the rule worked.  20% were actually search queries related to the solution of work issues.  The rest is fun and something hotter.  Yes, people are right at work watching porn.  Yes, people watch movies during working hours, choose their own clothes, shoes, learn lessons for children, repair cars, etc.  I especially remember one cupcake from a remote branch, which ... And here I‚Äôll put an end.  So that you feel the moment.  Every three hours (!) Formulated such requests in Yandex, that ... As in that joke, ‚Äúto hell with feathers, I want to see it !!!‚Äù.  And yes, I really would like to see what happened in that office.  Look at the work environment and work atmosphere, so to speak.  Alas, for obvious reasons, I can not bring these requests here, but at that time I was very funny to read these perversions.  If it were not sad, at the same time. <br><br>  Yes, and your employees also do about the same.  If you have a small company, it is possible that not yet.  But if you have grown to a certain size, there are a lot of people, you are seated in different cabinets - believe that 100% of the working time for people does not go to work.  After such a light analysis, we began to study the question of how we can control the work of employees, the use of corporate communication channels and equipment for personal purposes.  And I must say that a large number of solutions are already on the market.  Such as: Time Doctor, Staff Cop, Stakhanovets and a number of similar products. <br><br>  We tested some of the solutions, but were limited in terms of budget and deployment time.  The decision that we chose turned out to be weakly working on old computer configurations, so some of the employees remained outside the control zone.  The program simply wildest on Windows XP.  Yes, we chose a solution only for Windows OS (due to budget constraints), but now some of these programs work in almost any OS.  There would be more time and a larger budget, most likely a different solution would be able to work in all our workplaces and under all the OSs we use. <br><br>  The question of monitoring employees went to the security service.  My task was to introduce such a system.  Yes, we worked a little for bureaucrats, made up papers, where we warned employees that they were being followed automatically.  Of course, many people were indignant (and they are just included in those 80%, by the way), but at the same time, labor productivity really grew.  People began to think about what they do at work, during working hours, using the company's technical means and communication channels, they began to roam less about online shopping, watch movies less and hang out on contact.  And they began to really devote more time to work.  This was confirmed by the DOE, in the logs of which requests to search engines for work moments began to make up the majority, except for requests for that cake from a remote office.  He consistently received requests every three hours, over which we were angry at the whole department. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/6d8/aa0/20f/6d8aa020ffd04eceb5bd9b1098b91304.png"><br><br>  As a conclusion, I can only say the following: <br><br>  The staff are lazy.  You can not even put Staff Cop, Time Doctor, Yaware.TimeTracker, Stakhanovets and the like.  It is enough to include in the employment contract a clause stating that such information is collected and to remind employees about it from time to time.  You can put it - but then faith in people can falter.  Do not forget that the collection of information is possible only after the person under the painting was warned, and, again, it is not necessary to install this software.  Leaving the signature - the person will already be more careful about their duties. <br><br>  Yes, here I tried to describe the situation in the office, that is, when you have a separate room and people work in it, there is some kind of infrastructure.  If you do not have an office and / or freelance workers, then I think you will not keep track of them while the work is being done.  But if the work ceases to be performed, or any delays begin to appear, then your desire to see what your employees are doing is quite understandable.  In this case, the network already has materials on this topic, <a href="http://www.ixbt.com/blogs/review-pc/dorogu-frilanseram---analiz-sovremennyh-prilozheniy-po-organizacii-vremenem.html">for example</a> .  I cite the link only in order to reduce the load on the servers of the corporation of goodness in search of information, do not count as advertising, please. <br><br>  I also wanted to add a few ‚Äúuser stories‚Äù, but this is perhaps the topic of a separate article about how users ‚Äútouch nothing‚Äù and ‚Äúit itself‚Äù. <br><br>  <strong>PS:</strong> can be judged strictly - this is my first publication here. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/398599/">https://habr.com/ru/post/398599/</a></p>
