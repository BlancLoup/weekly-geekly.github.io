      GNome's conservative users will be delighted by the new green theme, the new Gnome, and the updated frontend for NetworkManager, which can now be prevented from performing system updates on mobile connections. <br><br>  KDE users will be happy to see the new KDE 4.3.  The new openSUSE KDEshnikov will be pleased with the integration of Firefox into KDE, which includes the design theme, file dialog and notifications, as well as the integration of OpenOffice.org with KDE4. <br><br>  The LiveCD has also undergone changes: Gimp and many other programs are now enabled by default on the disk with the gnome and from where, as well as additional localizations, among which are Russian.  Also, according to numerous requests, the pptp package and the corresponding NetworkManager plugin are now included on the LiveCD. <br><br>  In addition, since this release, all LiveCDs are hybrid, which means that they can not only be cut into a CD, but also written to a USB flash drive with the command <br><br> <code>dd if=openSUSE-LiveCD.iso of=/dev/sdf bs=4M</code> <br>  where <b>/ dev / sdf</b> is your flash drive. <br><br>  Administrators will be pleased with the changes in zypper, which now has different strategies for updating the system, the default strategy is to download all the packages and then install them. <br><br>  Also, for administrators, it is worth reminding that sshd now does not start by default after installation, you must enable its launch yourself in YaST&gt; System&gt; System Services (Runlevel) <br>  Samba now uses tdbsam as the default for passdb instead of smbpasswd, which was used in previous releases.  Detailed instructions on converting the database and transition to the new format can be found in the Release Notes. <br><br>  The MySQL socket is moved to / var / run / mysql. <br><br>  Dialogs for configuring keyboard and mouse have been removed from SaX2, use the capabilities of your DE to customize them, or edit the hal settings <br><br>  The package management system has also been optimized, rpm has been updated to version 4.7 and now all localization packages and kernel-sources have a noarch architecture, which has saved space on DVDs and in repositories. <br><br>  Those users who will install 11.2 from DVD will certainly notice that they have a kernel-desktop kernel installed instead of the usual -default.  This core is specially optimized for increased responsiveness for use on the desktop.  In this kernel, the optimization by size is turned on, FULL_PREEMTION is on and HZ = 1000 is set.  For users who installed openSUSE from the LiveCD -desktop, the kernel is available in the repositories. <br><br>  One of the highlights of the distribution - YaST has also undergone changes.  Firstly, YaST has found its mascot, the Jasti trumpet, secondly the Qt version of YaST is now completely written in Qt4 and fits perfectly into the KDE4 environment, and thirdly, the distribution comes with experimental support for the web interface for YaST <br><br>  The YaST module for disk partitioning has been significantly improved, now during installation you can configure disk encryption, as well as select experimental file systems, such as btrfs. <br><br>  <a href="http://software.opensuse.org/112/ru">Choose the most convenient way and download</a> <br>  Be sure to read the <a href="http://download.opensuse.org/distribution/11.2/repo/oss/docu/RELEASE-NOTES.en.html">Release Notes</a> before upgrading and installing. <br>  <b>And don't forget - Have a lot of fun!</b> <br>  <b>UPD:</b> use aria2c for the fastest downloads, download.opensuse.org is optimized for this utility or for any other rocker that supports metalinks </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/74925/">https://habr.com/ru/post/74925/</a></p>
