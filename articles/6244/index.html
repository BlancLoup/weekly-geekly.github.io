Katerina was drunk and in her eyes the overturned sky froze.  She always said: ‚ÄúIf I have to go to bed with the Body, I will drink a bucket of vodka.  Only they are obviously not throwing up vodka ... ‚Äù  And this moment has come.  A bucket of vodka in Katka, of course, did not get, but she got a decent amount of money.  She even found the strength to stretch her lips in a kind of smile. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  The body, tightening the pants and panties with its plump priests, occasionally trembled.  And in the brain floating in vodka by Katykin there appeared an impression that flocks of giant fleas migrating in search of a more comfortable shelter run across the Body.  She shuddered in disgust.  Meanwhile, loose whitish body with signs of male cellulite was approaching the fragile maiden flesh like a hungry maggot on a corpse during the half-life.  With her eyes on the bottom of the Body's down belly, Katyukha could not hold back the half-sleeps-half-tone, which was mistakenly interpreted as an impulse of passion, and she immediately received a grateful slobbering kiss on her ear. <br><br>  The body was touching Katerina's chest, and occasionally tried to stick her hand under the elastic ass.  For some reason, Katyukha remembered how she had long since gone to sea with her mother and spent the night in the village where she was put to bed during the pre-war times a spring bed with a wadded mattress.  It was this mattress that reminded her of the Body.  It was as if stuffed with cotton, which from old age fell into lumps and bulged out in different places.  And it smelled from the Body as well as from that mattress - mold and something sour.

      After some time, the Body has moved - now it was lying between Katkina's legs.  With a blunt perseverance, something was beating about the thighs, trying to find the entrance to the vagina.  Five minutes later, Katerina could not stand it, and rolling her eyes in disgust, she felt with her hand a flabby process and gave it direction. <br><br>  The head on the body smiled with its mouth, showing rare crooked teeth.  The mouth opened, stuck out his tongue and tried to stick it to Katka in his mouth, smelling badly digested soft-boiled eggs.  From disgust the girl covered with a sweltering wave and she shivered finely.  The Katkins convulsions were immediately recognized as the most powerful orgasm, and the Body, accepting this as a guide to action, grunted sluggishly, got rid of excess semen, and sounded farmerly. <br><br>  Having rolled heavily from Katka The body went limp.  She turned her head, opened her eyes and tried to focus her gaze on the hands that had just touched her breasts.  The hand was a shovel, with short, thick fingers, and deep pores.  Of these pores, hair of a dirty gray color stuck out in places.  Burrs hovered around the unevenly bitten nails in shavolded heaps.  The nails themselves had oblong grooves and fatty crumbs of an old fungus. <br><br>  And here Katka finally vomited. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/olpictures/1bd/666/7f8/1bd6667f85d38d210b1f7568a4b1ac50.jpg" width="309" height="482" hspace="10" vspace="10"></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/6244/">https://habr.com/ru/post/6244/</a></p>
