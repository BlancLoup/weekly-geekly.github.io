  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Ruby on Rails Developer Competency Matrix</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  How can a beginner Rails developer understand which way to dig in order to become an experienced programmer as quickly as possible?  It is clear that you need to work, work and work again.  But besides this, the horizon is important, which will make it clear which way to go along the road to the title of professional. <br><br>  Two months ago, we launched offline &amp; online courses in <b>Ruby on Rails</b> in Kharkov for beginners in <a href="http://rubybursa.com/%3Futm_source%3Dhabr">RubyBursa</a> .  Of the features - half of the classes were in the classroom, half in the format of a webinar.  We put tough conditions for doing homework and for the first failure the participants received a yellow card, for the second - red and dropped out of the courses.  Such ‚Äúdraconian methods‚Äù allowed 35 out of 40 participants to reach the end with 100% fulfillment of all household tasks. <br><br>  Some students in the process of learning were interested in: "and then what?".  Our teacher Oksana specially prepared a trial version of the Ruby developer competency matrix in the form of an answer to this question.  We do not pretend to be academic and understand the possible controversy of the proposed scheme.

If the code is not needed - I'll comment it out - it will suddenly come in handy.  sometimes thinking about refactoring ... </td><td>  I try to keep the logic in the model, scrub my code.  methods are not large, the code is clear when read by other programmers </td><td>  the code is clean.  I use different patterns (I know when and what is better), well, not a code, but a pretty sight :) </td></tr><tr><td colspan="3">  <b>Planning, estimating</b> </td></tr><tr><td>  spend planning their tasks and estimeyty.  preliminary estimeyty often do not converge with the actual execution time </td><td>  I can plan and evaluate a system of average complexity.  in reality, everything sleditsya according to plan (with a slight error) </td><td>  I can plan and evaluate a complex project (for myself and the team), distribute tasks.  everything fits according to plan (with a slight margin of error) </td></tr><tr><td colspan="3">  <b>RoR news</b> </td></tr><tr><td>  I read some posts ... in Russian ... if someone throws a link ... </td><td>  Periodically punches for reading / viewing news in the world of RoR <br></td><td>  I listen to podcasts / read the latest news, in general, that neither is aware of </td></tr></tbody></table><br>  Summing up: <br><table border="1" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="2"><tbody><tr><td>  up to 25 </td><td>  weak ... very weak ... but how many interesting things ahead! <br></td></tr><tr><td>  25-52 </td><td>  you already know something and you can.

The best way would be to ask your employers to give you tasks that in practice will allow you to pull up the right direction.  If this is not yet possible, practice your home project.  Theoretical study of blogs and books will give a smaller result.  Successes! <br><br>  PS Now we are recruiting for a two-month online Ruby on Rails <a href="http://rubybursa.com/%3Futm_source%3Dhabr">RubyBursa course</a> , which will begin in mid-May.  Courses are designed for beginners Ruby developers, as well as "IT polyglot" </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/220037/">https://habr.com/ru/post/220037/</a></p>
