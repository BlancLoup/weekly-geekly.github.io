  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Analytical miracle (about our brain on Megamind)</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"> Analytics is generally of two types: one is mandatory and very necessary, when small changes are made to an already existing project or concept and then, based on numerical measurable indicators and ratios, quite transparent conclusions are made, why is option B itself preferable to option A, since more relevant to the current business objectives.  Well, this is the most primitive, known and used by all.  But there is also analytics in a vacuum, when data is collected to create a new project from scratch or to choose from several options for new major functions, visible chips, or categories of users into an existing project.  Here on this today and dwell. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/megamozg/post_images/3f2/98c/4e8/3f298c4e825c1d2797395be4e3fbe8ae.jpg" alt="image"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Did you pay attention, as the new-fashioned trend words, which we have not yet fully comprehended inside, immediately acquire an aura of invincibility, super-usefulness, uniqueness.  Agree, such magic words as BigData, guidelines, analytics - produce on the psyche the same life-giving effect that just a couple of years ago, usability type spells were made on our fragile minds or there ‚Äúdesign thinking‚Äù.  Today, with a real example, I am trying to show how in reality people use the thesis about the importance of an analytical approach and the usefulness of all the conclusions made after spending huge amounts of money on preliminary research. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/megamozg/post_images/e2a/d84/31d/e2ad8431d3d82c0a0c72b34c6ef1f35b.jpg" alt="image">

      In my youth, I was fascinated by the decision-making technique with the help of a piece of paper divided in half, on the one hand of which all the advantages are written out, and on the other - all the disadvantages.  It seemed to a miracle for anxious reason affected by spermatoxemia that the counting of the arguments FOR and AGAINST from my own head so cleverly helps me decide on the choice of a future university, profession, girl, evening pastime, etc.  It seemed like magic until I realized how it all really works. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/megamozg/post_images/145/f7c/ce1/145f7cce1423e092c6d4f143c03ddfea.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  After all, in fact, every time I diligently teased myself to myself, summing up several minuses into one where I ‚Äúwanted‚Äù to make a decision FOR, diligently silencing some negative points, finding them too insignificant.  Very often, I wrote the same plus in different synonyms in six different points, adding weight to the right solution.  And I did it absolutely sincerely, with a pure heart, without even a second feeling a trick at the moment of making a decision.  When the years passed, when I realized how many minuses I missed due to the usual ignorance or subconscious muhlezh - my hair stood on end.  It turns out that instead of analyzing the process and getting rid of uncertainty, I simply manipulated myself as primitively as possible, pretending to be engaged in a purely clever psychological technique. <br><br>  With shaking hands, I rushed to the Internet - the source of knowledge.  And for sure, this <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%25A0%25D0%25B0%25D1%2586%25D0%25B8%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BB%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B7%25D0%25B0%25D1%2586%25D0%25B8%25D1%258F_(%25D0%25BF%25D1%2581%25D0%25B8%25D1%2585%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BB%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B3%25D0%25B8%25D1%258F)">Wikipedia entry</a> has reduced my future old age of commercials by 15: <br><br>  <i>Rationalization (lat. Rationalis - reasonable, lat. Ratio - mind) is a psychological defense mechanism in which only that part of the perceived information is used in thinking, and only those conclusions are made that make your own behavior appear to be well-controlled and not contrary to objective circumstances.</i>  <i>In other words, the selection (search) of a rational explanation for behavior or decisions that have other, unconscious reasons.</i> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/megamozg/post_images/11f/c59/515/11fc59515a79436f865b5824b5998037.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Everything is just like that.  The decision has always been made by me.  And the analyst involved as a super-useful tool has always remained only to calm some Internal Critic, hired purely for the sake of appearance, in order to hide the absolute venality of my entire Jury of Consciousness.  And so, to calm one formal character inside the head, the arguments and arguments were completely formally selected, and some of the most important (even critical) information was silenced, plus some (most important, as usual) data could not be obtained.  To analyze the event with incomplete data is possible only on the basis of probability, the way it is done in poker.  And nothing else. <br><br>  A question to the audience when was the last time you saw an analytical calculation with a harmonious engineering calculation of the probabilities of dozens of the most anticipated events, how is the analysis of the ‚Äúhand‚Äù in poker on a short table with a small blind?  Never agree.  Then call the police. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/megamozg/post_images/c69/3d9/7a6/c693d97a6bef2e8c406091c41c58615e.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  So, years have passed, and it turned out that many adult and respectable people around me always always behave in this way, pushing incomplete data to the previously made decision to go all-in. <br><br>  So, getting to the input, for example, 15 analytical theses, only ten of them are aware of the meaning, only six of which can be adapted to their own long-existing hypothesis, invented five years ago under a beer with friends - and the final decision of the company is made for five years, bingo!  Legally, that‚Äôs all true: the victory of the six most suitable arguments embedded in the hypothesis FOR, and only 4 AGAINST, is evident, as if visually showing everyone how smart and perspicacious the type analyst is. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/megamozg/post_images/819/737/4f1/8197374f13bc78a7624bc7884de28904.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Once again, real data obtained by analytics can be interpreted, bent and placed in any postures convenient for a person who is looking for excuses for his own long-standing idea.  Examples from life will not take long to find: <br><br>  Has a man got a handy report with Avito and Instagram indicators for the last quarter?  - Great, and immediately the conclusion is instantly made: it means that people need new catalogs of ads, and more beautiful photos.  We merge projects into one, and conquer the world with the new project ‚ÄúInstaVito‚Äù, where ads for the sale of cars and apartments are written on top of photos.  Cool?  Will you make me material? <br><br>  Another typical idea that comes to me every month is people who suddenly read yesterday an interview with Kalinov or Zuckerberg.  The next morning, after such an intense reading, they always have memories like 3 years ago, in the toilet they were very passionately whispering to intern Asa that they needed a special social network for travelers for a long time, which would help them, together with reverent Asya, to get away from the hated ghoul boss from work and establish A new travel start-up, part-time "Facebook killer" to eat black caviar with a shovel.  All you need is just to design a thing in flat where people will post their travel reports.  Well, is it brilliant?  And what, here are the statistics of requests in Yandex, here are the publicly available data on profit (someone else's), here is the success of the team (someone else's talents), which means I will have the same amount of money and experts in subordination - since all others already have it.  Believe me, at this analytical level millions of people think today, and your minus of this article will not affect this situation in the country and in the world. <br><br>  So, you and I figured out that all this is not brilliant insights, these are just games of your mind, glitches of the subconscious, always trying to justify all associative nonsense even inside yourself.  And almost any existing analyst at the stage of the absence of a real product that has stuffed a hundred cones works exactly the same way - it shows the existing achievements of others, rather than evaluating the multiple probabilities and potential of yourself, no matter how sad it sounds. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/megamozg/post_images/47a/4c1/3b3/47a4c13b3675df07ed4d0bbc0cd2eb8b.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Have you paid several thousand dollars for the list of the most popular Russian cities for foreigners to visit middle-aged and middle-income?  The question is - for what?  What will you do now with this list: Moscow, Peter, Kazan?  Correctly, with optimism, create on the basis of this data the English-language website of the fascinating gastronomic tour Balalayka &amp; Matrioshka.com, which you conceived in grade 9 in a geography lesson, singing the song Lube: ‚ÄúBath, vodka, accordion and salmon‚Äù.  This very solution was originally in your head, which is why you actually ordered this analyst for your own self-affirmation. <br><br>  And the opposite will also be true: if you don‚Äôt have a ready-made application for phones and smart watches saving children from under the wheels of cars, then you will never be interested in statistics and analytics on the number of children killed in traffic accidents by year, region, gender, level of wealth of their family, etc.  But all of it is freely available, but nobody cares about this, in general, absolutely.  As if startups about saving lives are simply banned by the legislation of the Russian Federation (in fact, there is no business, of course).  And even if they bring you these data on the table, circle them with markers, show a video - not a single nerve will tremble inside us.  Just because a supermaterial-mega-flat-application with interactive maps of the ‚ÄúD√©ospassikate‚Äù dangerous turns is not traced in your mind.  No, you do not need this simply because nothing of the kind has yet been visited by your creative mind a year earlier, and this means that you have no reason to justify yourself with the ‚ÄúAnalytica‚Äù spell, since your mind is completely calm and relaxed. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/megamozg/post_images/c24/44b/e80/c2444be8005b4554e30e05d93c390fe4.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  These are the pies. <br><br><h4>  References </h4><br>  <a href="http://gladwell.com/blink/">gladwell.com/blink</a> <br>  <a href="http://www.pcytherapy.ru/psy_61">www.pcytherapy.ru/psy_61</a> <br>  <a href="http://www.openspace.ru/article/899">www.openspace.ru/article/899</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/294902/">https://habr.com/ru/post/294902/</a></p>
