  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Crowdfunding campaign OpenMandriva on IndieGoGo</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  <i>One of the contributors OpenMandriva asked me to place on Habr√© a translation of the description of their <a href="https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/free-easy-and-secure-advanced-software-for-all">crowdfunding campaign</a> .</i>  <i>I readily agreed, because</i>  <i>I really respect the opensource community (I use Ruby on Rails in my work, open source is our everything).</i> <br><br>  The nonprofit association OpenMandriva comes from the old Mandrake-Mandriva community and is a completely independent organization that develops and maintains its own Linux distribution.  We have been developing the OS for 2 years.  All project participants are volunteers who believe in the free software world and devote their time to the development, design, and infrastructure of a project whose goal is software free of any spyware.  Our association is legally registered in France, but community members live around the world, representing more than 30 countries from all continents. <br><br>  <b>We believe that the operating system should be free for the user, be adaptable to his needs, technically advanced, but at the same time easy and convenient.</b>  <b>We already have experience in developing and supporting the OS, which you can fix and try right now.</b>  <b>Download OpenMandriva Lx 2014.1 here: <a href="http://openmandriva.org/">http://openmandriva.org/</a> .</b> <b><br></b> <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  If the OS already exists, why are we campaigning?  Our next release is scheduled for May 2015 and we need your help to further support and develop this high-quality product. <br>  The fact that the last 2 releases were downloaded tens of thousands of times, and the reviews are good, inspired us to develop the project.  See for yourself! <br><blockquote>  ‚ÄúThe operating system (OpenMandriva Lx 2014.1) is stable, the interface is friendly.  For the most part I liked the distribution.  In OpenMandriva, there is a sense of completeness and friendliness that is difficult to qualify, but which are definitely there.  The installation of the system, the Control Center and the pleasant (already traditional) desktop environment, everything is designed so that even the beginner can be comfortable.  A special impression was made by the `systemd` user environment.  &lt;...&gt; OpenMandriva did an excellent job polishing the details of the systemd that is responsible for the user environment.  &lt;..&gt; Of those that I saw, OpenMandriva 2014.1 is one of the most worthy of the crown "beginner friendly".  This distribution is easy to install, use, has an excellent control center and should be suitable for both beginners and advanced users.  I was pleased and impressed with OpenMandriva 2014.1, I recommend trying it out. <br>  <a href="http://distrowatch.com/weekly.php%3Fissue%3D20141110"><i>Jesse Smith, Distrowatch</i></a> </blockquote><br><blockquote>  OpenMandriva Lx 2014.0 looks solid and complete.  A quality level at a level that can be achieved only when experienced developers and other community members are seriously involved in the project.  Most hardware devices are supported and configured by default.  Definitely a very good start for the next releases.  Congratulations to the OpenMandriva team on this release! <br>  <i>Ga√´l Duval, founder of Mandrake.</i> </blockquote><br><blockquote>  (OpenMandriva Lx 2014.0 Beta) A breath of fresh air with KDE soul. <br>  <i>Silviu Stahie, Softpedia.</i> </blockquote>

    <h2>  What do we need and what do you get? </h2><br>  All the work needed to release the next release is done by volunteers, an international team of community members.  We need the money to support the infrastructure (mainly server hosting), occasional purchases of the necessary hardware (for example, ARM boards) and demonstration of the results of work at major open source exhibitions (for example, FOSDEM, LinuxTag).  Presence at exhibitions is also important for the exchange of information and the study of innovations, for their subsequent implementation in our OS.  The total amount required for all these needs for 2015 is $ 27, 500 USD. <br>  We set a campaign goal of $ 15, 000 USD and we hope that with your help we will be able to collect $ 27, 500 USD! <br>  We believe that thousands of our users and those who have just become them, or those who simply believe and support high-quality open source products will make achieving the goal possible. <br>  If we do not reach the full amount, the money will be spent on the same goals, but they will be enough for a smaller amount, a shorter period. <br><br>  <b>What are you getting?</b> <br>  Intuitive and easy to use, and at the same time an advanced user-oriented system.  We listen to the community, conduct regular user surveys and develop the product as closely as possible to the wishes.  The system is free and open.  We welcome new members who want to learn new things in open source, together with professionals and in a friendly atmosphere.  Our task is to maintain and develop free software, to keep the availability of an advanced and easy-to-use product for everyone. <br>  We do everything to be at the forefront of new products in the world of OpenSource, and to provide our users with the freshest and most interesting.  An example of this can be seen in our release: we switched to the default LLVM / clang compiler by default ( <a href="http://www.phoronix.com/scan.php%3Fpage%3Dnews_item%26px%3DMTgzMzI">http://www.phoronix.com/scan.php?page=news_item&amp;px=MTgzMzI</a> ).  Enjoy fresh interesting solutions with us! <br><br>  <b>Risks</b> <br>  What are the risks?  The only possible risk is if the work on the system is not completed.  It is almost at the zero level, as the community grows, new participants appear, and this process has been going on for 2 years.  The project does not have high risks, the only need is to raise funds to support the infrastructure. <br><br>  <b>How else can you help</b> <br>  If you cannot donate, but would like to help, you can still do it! <br><ul><li>  spread information about our company wherever possible - on your blog, twitter, tell your friends, share the link wherever possible - it will help! </li><li>  use the indiegogo sharing tools! </li><li>  join our project!  Developers, translators, designers, specialists in infrastructure or public relations, advanced or just students - we are growing and we will be glad to see new team members!  Just write a few words about you at join@openmandriva.org! </li></ul></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/247511/">https://habr.com/ru/post/247511/</a></p>
