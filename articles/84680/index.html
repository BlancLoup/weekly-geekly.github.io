  <section class="page js-page"><h1>The glass is half full: the destruction of negative myths about your own business</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  So much for the last 2 months on Habr√© were articles on the myths and breakup of their own business.  After reading yesterday <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/startup/84614/">fresh</a> , it seemed to me that such arguments can easily discourage any thoughts about startups and going to free swimming for most readers.  This is wrong, I can say it absolutely for sure - it has been tested on itself. <br><br>  We started our business a year ago - website development.  Before that, we all three founders (I am a manager, professional and programmer) worked in a well-known studio in our region.  For the year we have completed everything we planned.  Our studio has become known in the region, we constantly have new customers and we support old ones.  We have a friendly small team of 7 full-time employees and we are working with approximately 10 freelancers at the moment.  And now about the myths. <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  1. Emotional freedom.  Plus the first one.  We can define our styles of website development, communication with customers, directions in graphics and software.  We are free to choose for ourselves where to go, all our moves forward are ours and only ours.  Nobody dictates the rules to us, we can arrange a day off on the studio‚Äôs birthday, on a holiday we can arrange a corporate trip to the cinema.  We ourselves set the tone for the team - a goal for friendly relations, for a team cohesive with an idea.  We design the office the way we like it and give our employees the freedom to design their jobs - as they like - the designer has a plush dog on the table, a figure of the Egyptian god on the table, and I have a poster with a cat behind my back.  We are going to studio - go to the camp site and go to visit each other - we are always together.  This is our freedom.

      2. Work at an inopportune time.  I can partially agree with this.  The first half a year for me it really was like that.  There were no projects, we started from scratch, phoned customers, looked for orders for freelancing.  I was so often on free-lance.ru, I looked at new projects, answered them, polished my portfolio, that now I was just sick of this site, of its appearance, etc. - but this is more emotional) I worked with 7 morning (at this time I started to watch projects, waking up, immediately check your mail and projects) to 24 or 1 of the new day.  I led up to 25 projects at once and was still looking for new ones.  I remember once I came home from the cinema with my husband, I was out at 3 o'clock, I immediately opened the laptop at one o'clock and started watching a tape of projects on freelancing - and I caught myself thinking - that's enough, it's time to stop.  A month later, we took a manager, then a programmer, and then another, a full-time designer.  Half a year has passed.  Now I perform the administrative duties and duties of the art director.  The husband, who worked as a programmer in the studio, coded his own studio projects and management crm.  We work from 9 to 18, then we are engaged in hobbies or household chores.  I open mail or projects at home only if I have absolutely nothing to do.  Everyone is happy. <br><br>  3. Financial freedom.  As they said in the comments, you get strictly taken away from your boss, you earn yours how much you earn, even if it is 1 ruble - but it's yours.  We had no particular problems with the payment of salaries.  Of course, the priority is always employees, only then we ourselves.  There was a time when we earned less than most of our employees.  But no one got into loans, did not borrow from friends and did not live from hand to mouth.  We earned a normal average salary in our city.  If you understand that this is a business, not a toy, then everything will be fine.  I will quote one more remarkable statement from the Habr - if you start behaving like children, you will receive a salary with sweets.  (I‚Äôm not responsible for accuracy).  Thoughts that employees get more than you are negative thoughts.  The more business earns in general - the higher the salaries of employees - the more motivated and happy they are.  Besides, you still work for yourself, for yourself. <br><br>  4. Self-realization.  The best thing is that it‚Äôs all at once.  If you competently organize your business, then the issues of tax and accounting features will concern you 2-3 times a month in the worst case.  I have 1C on my computer, I bill once a day - several at once, it does not bother me.  We go to the accountant to whom we pay 2000 (at a distance) once a month, we meet with the tax every two months.  No straining. <br><br>  But - the programmer studies new software features, masters the new and sets the tone in programming, the SEO manages his own business, and I moved from the category of managers to the category of art director.  I like to do design more than delve into programming.  I do what I like. <br>  Of course, this was not always the case, but literally half a year.  Six months, while we worked together.  Now the delegation of authority gives freedom for self-realization. <br><br>  5. My business is my rules <br>  This is absolutely true, I partially wrote in paragraph 1.  we ourselves hire employees, form a friendly team - in which everyone is comfortable working with each other.  We have no negativity, envy, aggression and intentional sick leave with vacations.  We have ideas that I share everything, the staff is motivated, formalized, full social package - and a normal salary is average for our region.  All work well and smoothly, if necessary - take work home. <br><br>  Instead of a conclusion. <br>  Our example is far from perfect, but it is adequate and fairly objective.  We are not a sect of optimists - and when the situation is unstable, we openly talk about it.  I'm just saying that you can look at things from a different angle - the devil is not so bad as he is painted.  Do not be afraid of the myths of people who have just started, and are already crying.  It‚Äôs like in a relationship, always wondering - how can you quarrel in a candy-bouquet period? This is the time when you only recognize a person, a storm of emotions, try something new - a period of joy and happiness.  Not everything is smooth, of course, but it is smoothed out.  Then everything is replaced by stability and confidence.  So here too - difficult periods pass and are experienced easily - if viewed positively.  And then begins a stable operation. <br><br>  Start your business - it is not easy, but it is possible. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/84680/">https://habr.com/ru/post/84680/</a></p>
