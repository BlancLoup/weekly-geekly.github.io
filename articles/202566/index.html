They came to buy faloimitators - came, saw, ordered. <br>  - Let it be.  We begin to fill themselves, the people and tighten up. </blockquote>

    <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  Few customers know why he really needs such things on the site: some of them follow intuition, some follow suit, and for some it's just another Wishlist.  Any social functionality is exactly the rating.  In one or another of his views: <br><br><ul><li>  Likes </li><li>  Add to favorites </li><li>  Comments (not only can the number of comments be equal to estimates, they also serve as feedback) </li><li>  The "share" function (unlike "likes" carries more rating points) </li></ul><br><br><blockquote>  Rating (eng. Rating) - a numeric or ordinal indicator that reflects the importance or significance of a particular object or phenomenon. </blockquote><br><br>  Ratings are an important component of the socialization of the Internet.  Just think: we choose hosting based on ratings, making purchases in online stores (especially foreign ones) - we look at the reviews before reading the entries in blogs or social networks - pay attention to the number of ‚Äúlikes‚Äù, and there are also these types of ratings that contribute in the life of the user on the site of rivalry, for example, the same <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/users/">rating of habra people</a> .  We use them every day, without even noticing how firmly they entered our lives. <br><br><h5>  And what about the development of rating systems? </h5><br>  As a rule, a certain amount (or hours) is spent once on the development of rating systems for the site owner: the system is developed, implemented, and, in fact, works.  It is rare when changes or additions are made to a working rating system, unless we are talking about really large projects. <br><br><blockquote>  Works - do not touch. </blockquote><br><br>  The network is full of ready-made plug-ins, libraries, and simple developments for rating systems, but the customer always needs something ‚Äúoriginal‚Äù, and speaking of code copyright, one way or another you‚Äôll have to write with your own pens. <br><br>  And what if on a site besides the usual rating of one or another entity, certain achievements or statuses are needed?  In this case, in addition to an additional check for revision, a check for design and creativity will roll out, and the developer will have: facepalm :, because everything will have to be sawed.  Or, you will have to develop a flexible system from scratch, and you should also write an admin for the whole thing!  Naturally, everything should work quickly and be considered correctly, which means testing, optimization and refactoring will be added to the above points. <br><br>  In this regard, we came up with the idea: why not bring all these calculations to the cloud?  At the same time build a fairly flexible system, organize an API and implement it on projects.  Some of the readers at this point will think: "who would doubt another startup."  My answer is yes, this is a ‚Äúregular‚Äù startup. <br><br>  The name of the startup - <b>Rangg</b> - was formed from the phrase <b>Rank Aggregation</b> .  Now the service is in development and ‚Äútouch‚Äù it, unfortunately, habrazhiteli not work.  We will definitely roll out the beta within a month, and the first to know about this will be Habr. <br><br>  As you have already guessed, the essence of the project is to build a cloud service rating and achievements, which could be implemented with minimal effort on the project, enable developers and site owners to build their rating systems with achievements, ranks and statuses.  We have compiled a short list of functionality that will be available at the launch of the project (can be changed): <br><br><ul><li>  Essence rating (more than obvious) </li><li>  The assignment of "status" depending on the rating </li><li>  Uploading your own images of statuses and achievements (besides the standard ones that we will provide) </li><li>  JS notifications (for example, receiving some achievement) </li><li>  Statistics and activity log </li></ul><br><br>  At the moment, the RESTful API is being developed (not without the help of habr posts) and the service of providing access, configuration and statistics.  The technologies we use on our project are quite popular: PHP + MySQL - service, NodeJS + MongoDB - API.  The next article will tell about the project architecture and the integration of these fairly well-established bundles. <br><br>  In conclusion, I would like to sincerely thank the administration for providing a blog; for your part, this is a huge step in support of startups. <br><br>  Turning to the hacker readers, I want to ask for constructive criticism of the project idea. <br><br>  <b>PS</b> If you made a mistake with the hubs - tell me exactly which article would fit better, correct it (I would like to add to ‚ÄúAnalysis and design of systems - lacked karma). </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/202566/">https://habr.com/ru/post/202566/</a></p>
