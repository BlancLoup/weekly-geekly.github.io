In the third quarter of 2015, 37.6% of its revenue was secured by cooperation with T2 RTK Holding ( <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tele2">Tele2</a> brand).  <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%2592%25D1%258B%25D0%25BC%25D0%25BF%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BB-%25D0%259A%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BC%25D0%25BC%25D1%2583%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B8%25D0%25BA%25D0%25B0%25D1%2586%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B8">Vimpelcom</a> accounted for 19% of revenue, <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%259C%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B1%25D0%25B8%25D0%25BB%25D1%258C%25D0%25BD%25D1%258B%25D0%25B5_%25D0%25A2%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BB%25D0%25B5%25D0%25A1%25D0%25B8%25D1%2581%25D1%2582%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BC%25D1%258B">MTS</a> - 17.7%, <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%259C%25D0%25B5%25D0%25B3%25D0%25B0%25D0%25A4%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BD">and Megafon</a> - 13.1%. <br><br>  A year ago, in the third quarter of 2014, most of the revenue of the Russian Towers (almost 32%) also fell on contracts with Tele2, a representative of the Russian Towers said.  At the same time, in 2014‚Äì2015, the share of Tele2 in the revenues of the infrastructure company only grew.  This growth is also due to the launch of Tele2 in Moscow. <br><br>  In 2014, the revenue of the ‚ÄúRussian Towers‚Äù ‚Äã‚Äãamounted to 561 million rubles, the forecast for 2015 is 1 billion rubles. <a name="habracut"></a>  The average quarterly revenue of the ‚ÄúRussian Towers‚Äù ‚Äã‚Äãin 2015 amounted to about 250 million rubles.  The operator Tele2 pays "Russian Towers" for the rental of towers about 94 million rubles.  According to the company representative, the revenue of the ‚ÄúRussian Towers‚Äù ‚Äã‚Äãas a whole in Q3 2015 increased by 68% compared with the previous year.

      According to the company, the Russian Towers operate a little more than 1,500 antenna mast structures throughout Russia.  At the beginning of the third quarter of 2015 there were 88% more than a year earlier.  Base stations of several operators can be located at each facility, so it‚Äôs not practical to count how many towers each operator rented, the representative of Russian Towers notes. <br><br>  Tele2 basically uses its own infrastructure, but is always ready to consider offers that make it possible to save money at the expense of the quality of communication, said Tele2 spokesman Konstantin Prokshin.  According to him, in Moscow Tele2 rents 500 objects from Russian Towers (another 700 from Vertical).  Renting facilities from infrastructure companies in Moscow is not only a matter of economic gain, but also of speeding up construction, according to Prokshin. <br><br>  Tele2 has quickly built a network in Moscow with cooperation with infrastructure operators, said Alexander Chub, president of the Russian Towers group of companies.  Russian operators are now independently building only those facilities for the construction of which infrastructure operators are not being taken due to economic inexpediency, he notes. <br><br>  Tele2 officially goes to the capital on October 22.  October 17, "Megamind" <a href="http://megamozg.ru/post/20348">wrote</a> that the operator scored billions in debts to run in Moscow. <br><br>  MTS leases antenna mast structures from both infrastructure companies and other mobile operators, says its representative Dmitry Solodovnikov.  According to him, she uses the objects of the ‚ÄúRussian Towers‚Äù ‚Äã‚Äãin Moscow and the Moscow Region, in St. Petersburg and some other regions.  The savings for each object are different, but in most cases the construction of its own tower is more appropriate, he notes. <br><br>  In Moscow, the lease of 1,000 high-altitude antenna-mast structures, built specifically for delivery, will cost about 600 million rubles a year, said Michael Alekseev, managing partner of <a href="http://www.acm-consulting.com/">AC &amp; M-Consulting</a> .  ‚ÄúRussian towers‚Äù ‚Äã‚Äãcan be called the largest operator of such facilities in Russia, but it is difficult to estimate their share - this market is very fragmented, he notes. <br><br>  According to Alekseev, the Russian rental market of high-rise buildings for cellular communications could become one of the largest in the world.  This could happen, for example, if approximately 7,000 towers of VimpelCom were sold - market participants have been discussing a possible deal for more than two years, he <a href="http://www.vedomosti.ru/technology/articles/2015/10/19/613275-russkie-bashni-zarabativayut-tele2">told</a> Vedomosti. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/295474/">https://habr.com/ru/post/295474/</a></p>
