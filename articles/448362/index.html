In order for our employees to live longer, we try to organize their work and leisure as interesting as possible.  For example, we send in travel. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/-w/rd/ce/-wrdceaiqm8luthj55i0d0fibhi.jpeg" alt="image"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Many large and not-so-organized companies organize visiting corporate parties.  Such events are designed to rally the team, arrange for employees to ‚Äúunload‚Äù, and usually it happens.  However, corporate travel can have much more goals: reboot, inspiration, exchange of experience, motivation of employees, development of the HR brand.  In order to achieve these goals, it is not enough to buy a ticket to the Turkish coast for the sales department.  We will tell you why WebCanape sends specialists abroad and how to do it with maximum benefit for the company. <br><br><h2>  Corporate travel - the beginning </h2><br>  For the first time, WebCanape employees all traveled abroad in 2014.  We opened an office in Germany and went by 2 cars to Munich to monitor and adjust the processes.  On that trip, we realized that the road unites, allows us to look at colleagues in a new way.  Interesting ideas may come along the way, which you can immediately discuss with your colleagues and make an important decision for the company.  Upon returning from Germany, we, of course, forgot about all this and began to work further.  True, more productive.  But especially nobody analyzed the reasons for the increase in efficiency.

      <br>
      March 2018.  The three long months of winter did not end at all, it seemed that the heat would never come, and the queues of tasks would not run out.  In such situations, creative artists are the first to suffer - designers began to give out one failed landing page after another.  Layouts were rejected, time for design grew, and efficiency dropped.  One of the founders of WebCanape offered to send the entire design department for inspiration so that the guys could get acquainted with the culture of other countries and accumulate ideas for work.  This is how the first canapetour, the WebCanape Design Tour 2018, happened. <br><blockquote>  I thought that it was necessary to send designers to Amsterdam to expand their ideas about culture and art, to ‚Äúbleed‚Äù the visual cortex of the brain.  In Smolensk, they will never see such material, but they work for people who are abroad. <br><br>  Andrey Kotov <br>  Director of Information Security WebCanape <br></blockquote>  The design team was strengthened by two people from technical support and an internal development department; in total, 2 crews with a total of 7 people turned out.  We decided to go by car, because from Smolensk it is very convenient to travel that way - only 700 km to Poland and 500 km to Lithuania.  The route was planned by yourself. <br><br><h2>  Trip plan: world masterpieces and plein airs </h2><br>  The route passed through 5 countries: Belarus, Poland, the Czech Republic, the Netherlands and Germany.  The center of the tour was Amsterdam, and on the way the group drove to Warsaw, Wroclaw and Prague.  Returned through Berlin. <br><br>  Mandatory program: <br><br><ul><li>  City Tours </li><li>  St. Vitus Cathedral and Karlstejn Castle </li><li>  Van Gogh Museum and Rijksmuseum </li><li>  Apple Museum in Prague </li><li>  Plein Air on the North Sea </li></ul><br>  New furnishings, new palette, world masterpieces of fine art and architecture, a completely different design environment - our designers had enough impressions for a long time.  The experience gained during the trip helped them to go beyond the usual perception and create in a completely new plane. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/7w/8h/53/7w8h53s_ppyq_gqc2t4taiwwyzu.png"><br><br>  However, improving the quality of work is not the only result of the WebCanape Design Tour 2018. We spend an enormous amount of time in the office, but even sitting with a person at neighboring tables, we may not know anything about his life, interests and habits.  The trip allowed colleagues to see each other in unusual surroundings.  Many became friends, some began to treat each other cooler.  The head of the design department Dima turned out to be a leader not only at work, but on a journey.  He organized a group and planned to move around the city.  Every day, designer Masha carefully prepared breakfast for everyone, for which she is still called Mom in the department.  Designer Misha talked about his Jewish roots and led his colleagues on iconic Jewish sights. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/fx/ln/pd/fxlnpdd5bkwwt7je1wycfrrggyk.jpeg"><br><blockquote>  A small group on a long journey is a separate community, which is partly closed within itself.  And here the characters appear especially vividly. <br>  Angelica Trofimova <br>  WebCanape Director </blockquote><h2>  What came of it </h2><br>  The ten-day voyage ended, everyone returned to work.  And the queue of tasks, accumulated for months, disappeared in two weeks.  New colors appeared on the banners, the layouts began to look more joyful.  Who knows what influenced more - the opportunity to get to know colleagues from unexpected sides and make friends, a change of atmosphere and new impressions, rest or inspiration, which originated from people, culture, new experience.  However, changes in work and attitudes towards work were immediately visible. <br><br>  After the first successful tour, we decided to make such trips a tradition.  And in the fall of 2018, our developers and testers went to their first WebCanape Techno Tour 2018.  They visited the Baltic countries and Finland, and after the tour they collected all the ideas that they had on the road, in a unified system of employee development - a wheel of professional competencies. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/qb/ew/cj/qbewcjicatkwbudigwyecyttw0e.jpeg"><br><blockquote>  Designers and programmers from trips returned a single team, with a bunch of new ideas.  Colleagues began to relate to each other on a more emotional level. <br><br>  Angelica Trofimova <br>  WebCanape Director </blockquote><h2>  Corporate tour from the inside: budget and organization </h2><br>  Organizing a company tour is easy, but there are three questions that should be answered at the very beginning: <br><br><ul><li>  Who is driving? </li><li>  Who pays? </li><li>  Who is responsible for what? </li></ul><br>  Usually these are people who have achieved success for the company, and the management has something to encourage them with a trip.  These employees tend to develop and have experience that they can share with colleagues.  If you bring these people together and send them to where they will spend most of their time side by side, they usually manage to achieve synergies and, as a result of the tour, create some value for the company. <br><br>  We send the most active, those for whom WebCanape is not only a place of work, but a company of like-minded people.  Typically, the backbone of the team collects the head of the department that goes on tour.  Approves candidates management of the company.  So far we have not rejected any of the proposed candidates. <br><br>  It is important that these people can tell about their impressions, ideas that arose during the trip, the results of the whole event.  This creates a favorable image of the company in the eyes of those who see it as a future place of work. <br><br><h2>  Who pays? </h2><br>  At each departure of employees abroad WebCanape lays 300 000 rubles.  From the budget of 250,000 rubles to employees compensate for accommodation and transportation.  Personal expenses, entertainment, as well as hotels and moving above the specified limit are paid by themselves.  About 50,000 rubles are usually spent on marketing activities around the tour - community management in social networks, targeted advertising, partner activities, designer work, magnets, T-shirts, badges, flags, and other paraphernalia. <br><br>  Additionally, each of the participants expects to spend about 30-40 thousand on food, personal expenses and entertainment within and beyond the program. <br><br>  It is worth noting that not all employees agree to go on such tours.  Often the cause may be personal circumstances - a small child, difficulties with obtaining visas.  But sometimes they refuse for financial reasons.  Since personal expenses fall on the shoulders of a tour participant, not everyone can allocate money from the family budget for traveling with colleagues. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/an/-v/pr/an-vpranbspagd75gutbadstoku.png"><br><br><h2>  Who is responsible for what? </h2><br>  A couple of months before the tour, the team will agree on the dates of the trip.  We usually choose a period when the absence of the majority of specialists in one direction will not greatly affect the work of the company.  The most successful time for this is the May holidays. <br><br>  The team thinks over the route and activities along the way, and then presents the program to the management.  The tour plan consists not only of the list of attractions.  Be sure to add activity related to professional activities: the exchange of experience with foreign colleagues, brainstorming, specialized museums and exhibitions.  After approval of the route and the program the company provides funding. <br><br>  We start communities in social networks, where travelers will keep reporting from the tour, organize contests for subscribers and tell interesting facts about the points of the route.  This is important because it helps build a company's reputation among applicants.  In IT there are always difficulties with recruitment, therefore the development of the HR brand is one of the tasks that WebCanape sets for employees by sending them on corporate tours. <br><br>  Upon return, everyone gathers thoughts into one presentation and holds a reporting meeting.  Here the rested and refreshed participants of the ‚Äúcanapetura‚Äù talk about, saw, learned, did on the trip, share plans, make suggestions on the development of the company. <br><blockquote>  We travel a lot.  One, two, three trips ... At some point you realize that you are returning a different person.  Proper travel greatly enrich and charge people.  Constant change of the picture outside the window, everything is always new.  New people, new countries, new ideas.  All this helps you to think creatively, to look wider at life and the work that you do.  And it is necessary to develop not only the most, but the entire team.  So the idea was to send our employees to the educational WebCanape. <br><br>  Vasily Churanov <a href="https://habr.com/ru/users/vasyay/" class="user_link">vasyay</a> <br>  The founder of the digital-agency WebCanape </blockquote>  Only a couple of weeks remained until the next ‚Äúcanapetura‚Äù.  This time we send our internet marketers to Italy.  From April 26 to May 5, they will travel around Lombardy, Tuscany and Lazio and keep a journal of the trip on VKontakte. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/v-/tk/e0/v-tke0tvzg8y1dbywdlmtds0tmy.jpeg"><br><br>  Evgeny Churanov and WebCanape team </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/448362/">https://habr.com/ru/post/448362/</a></p>
