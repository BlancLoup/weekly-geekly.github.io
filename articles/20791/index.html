  <section class="page js-page"><h1>How I did a startup in Russia - Part 1 [Where are the legs]</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Thanks to the guys who raised my karma and made it possible to write all this. <br>  As I said, I'm not a programmer, not a system administrator or a designer.  Yes, I have some knowledge that allows me to communicate with all these specialists, but they are completely inadequate for their tasks. <br>  So: I have my own business that is not related to WEB, I have been using a computer since 1988, I understand why register_global is bad, but to make a layout using a 1995 textbook or having studied a site like ‚ÄúHelp me start a web-masculine‚Äù (c) kost is generally trouble  In addition, I am lazy, which in certain cases makes it hard to work with my head and I have spare cash for a strange hobby - WEB and everything connected with it. <br>  But all this means nothing, or rather did not mean. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  In 2005, I launched a project based on a standard CMS, I was smart enough to figure out how everything works there, to tweak the CMS myself a little [you don‚Äôt need to giggle if you knew what time it took for me to learn about PHP from this very CMS :)], but the result was [in principle, it still exists] 32,000 registered active users and 150,000 hits per day, with 200-480 users online, the search engines hated this CMS with fierce hatred, a server who just did not reach [especially why the Turks :)] and there was no bare ass and other honey for m  s and others of that ilk.  Periodically there were offers of the type: let's give a small share for us and let us have money from all this.  They did not understand that I was not interested in principle.  I was preparing to make a start!  :) Long intro?  I agree, but without it you will not understand - WHY? <br><br>  All this time, starting in 2000, I slowly studied and analyzed what this WEB is [although I was online long before] and how it works.  Immediately make a reservation, the goal was - and it was terrible: to fuck in the end money, but to make it beautiful and ‚Äúnoble.  I do not believe people who say: Look, we are doing a project and we are doing it just like that.  Perhaps this does not apply to part of blogs and sites such as personal pages.  PROJECTS no one ever does just like that, always a cockroach sits inside and whispers: give me a coin :) <br><br>  There is such a cockroach in me too, this animal was silently silent, and then stirred.  It's time to say, stop sitting and analyze - come on a coin.  And this is where the WEB ends and the business begins.  I have already said that, by its nature, I am capitalist and naturally I began to first build a non-WEB project [especially since I cannot build it, i.e.  turn into code, website, etc.], and a business that is expressed in a WEB project.

      A small digression [hard]: there are a lot of sites where people write: I have an idea, I made a presentation, I will explain to you how and what should work - we are waiting for an investor ... and posting all this stuff on the network :).  There are people who write smart articles about the fact that this is bad, but this is not on the Internet, but this and that should be done.  The first losers - the second bore.  Both of these categories will always be asking or nudging, they will always have beautifully designed presentations and written articles with clever words.  Do not ask yourself - if you're so smart, then why so poor? <br>  Remove the cursor from the minus of karma, I warned that it would be tough. <br>  There are, yes there are people with ideas, and good and thoughtful.  Not everything is so bad :) Often, or rather almost always, they do not have available funds.  Do you think there will be money and everything will go?  Not.  If there is a lot of money, then most likely something will turn out, but it will be crutches. <br><br>  There is only one option - to do your project and not wait for someone to do it for you.  If you think that your idea is worth something and you are sure of it, take a risk and start at least something like this - then sell or take a share.  It's all very simple, no one except you will understand your idea to the end, no matter how much you say and present.  Moreover, your idea, when you begin to implement it, in the larger case will begin to turn into a completely different project, better and more interesting [more expensive].  But if you are not ready for risk, then your idea is worth nothing and you understand it in your heart.  Perhaps you are lazy, but not the laziness that I have :) <br><br>  In general, if you have read this far, then about ‚Äúfrom where the legs‚Äù to pour water I finish. <br><br>  ... started to cost a business.  Weighed potency: <br><br>  DISCOVERY: <br>  Availability <br>  1. the idea itself <br>  2. money <br>  3. minimal experience <br>  4. people whom I can turn to invest [but not the initial stage] <br>  5. people whom I can connect to promotion [but not the idea itself] <br>  6. project time <br>  7. any business experience <br>  8. desire and 100% confidence <br>  9. the ability to sometimes go ahead and plow as much as necessary [yes, despite laziness] <br>  9. not a fool [not sure ...] <br><br>  absence of: <br>  1. TK in text form <br>  2. programmer <br>  3. system analyst <br>  4. designer <br>  5. iron <br>  6. hosting <br>  7. office [for project] <br>  8. cook <br><br>  The term of the release of the beta [with a cut-down factor] in a period of 5 months <br>  Your opinion - can I start? <br>  [a little more water, to understand the situation] - To calculate everything, in principle, it is not possible and I understood and did not hide the possibility of failure or its sluggish commercialization in negotiations with future project participants.  I like the comparison with well drilling.  Anyone needs money to drill it, but there may be no oil there, especially if you drill somewhere in the area ... [look for yourself in google - where there is no oil and it wasn‚Äôt at all!  :)] Not only that, I explained from the very beginning that I wouldn‚Äôt open the whole idea of ‚Äã‚Äãthe project until a certain moment, but I‚Äôll show and tell where the first trickle of oil comes from :) This stream, several thousand dollars and assurances that I will cover all the costs of creating the project was enough for successful negotiations. <br>  As a result, I crossed out the first three points from the ‚Äúabsence‚Äù list and decided not to go to Mexico with friends, but to roll up my sleeves to start DOING THE STARTUP!  Business began, joyfully and interrupting each other, deliberated for several days, the idea flowed with a large fountain and overgrown with small fountains :) I started to lead smarmy and preparing negotiations with items 5 and 6 [Hello Sanya :)] from the first list. <br>  I forgot to say absolutely - the idea was not how to rob or even how to draw a coin from users - exactly the opposite.  And do not read everything written with a frown - smile, Mexico [this country] will not go away from you. <br>  This is all for now.  All project participants visit this resource :) Most likely this startup poem will consist of ... well, probably just from the number of items in the "absence" list <br>  It is a pity that there is no blog "I am great", because  great to be simple, but smart is not necessary. <br>  PS did not set a link to the project, so that there would be no comments - like: left PR.  But the project itself is online and even visited in a reduced form. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/20791/">https://habr.com/ru/post/20791/</a></p>
