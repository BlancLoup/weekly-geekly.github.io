  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Online store. Beginning of work</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Hello, habragraod! <br>  I wrote a long time about a small article about osCommerce, I was even asked to post my build.  If someone still needs it, I have left, I can put a thread somewhere.  But, after eating with USC, we decided to write our own system.  With CakePHP.  This was well <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/webdev/44338/">told by</a> comrade <a href="https://habr.com/ru/users/neudor/" class="user_link">neudor</a> , with whom we developed this business for a couple.  At the moment, he has somewhat moved away from working with the store, so I grab his baton from him to lead a series of articles on software development for the online store, as well as directly organizing the work itself, delivery service, registration, taxes.  In general, a complete FAQ "from and to" - what awaits a budding entrepreneur, if he decides to open a fully legal business in Russia, with the calculation of costs in terms of money and time.  So, today I will talk about the side of the issue, not related to the technical implementation ... <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br><h1>  Legal clearance </h1>  <i>Who is already familiar with the subtleties of communication with our tax authorities - they can skip this section, because</i>  <i>there will be no new information for you here</i> <br><br>  I chose to register PI, as there are fewer problems with accounting, and indeed hemorrhage.  For registration of IP you need: <br>  - passport <br>  - received TIN <br>  - application for registration of physical persons as an IP <br>  - insurance and pension certificate <br>  - 4 photos 3x4; <br>  - 400r state  duty <br>  All this is done in tax. 
      <br>
        <script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>
        <ins class="adsbygoogle"
          style="display:block; text-align:center;"
          data-ad-layout="in-article"
          data-ad-format="fluid"
          data-ad-client="ca-pub-6974184241884155"

      <br>
      In the application, it is desirable to specify the maximum list of what you will do.  Yes, it can be corrected at any time, but because of this, once again go to the tax office ... These lines ... After submitting the application for registration, within 14 days you need to submit an application for transfer to the simplified taxation system.  Otherwise, put the usual - and there will have to pay more. <br>  So, there are two simplified taxation systems: a tax on income and a tax on ‚Äúincome minus expenses‚Äù. <br>  1) Tax on income.  The funds credited to the account, the registered purchases by the cash register, etc.  From this amount will be charged 6%. <br>  2) Tax on income expenses.  The difference between the received and spent money is taken, and 15% is charged from this difference. <br>  Simply consider that it is more profitable.  If the occupation is resale, then naturally, the second option will be more profitable.  If pure income, such as freelancing, then the first. <br><br>  A few days later, the tax will issue a certificate of the OGRN IP (Primary State Registration Number of the individual entrepreneur) and an extract from the Unified State Register (United State Register of Entrepreneurs).  With all the documents you need to go to the local statistics bodies and get registered there.  A few days later they will issue a "letter" with the state codes of OKPO, OKATO, etc. <br><br>  Now you need to register with the pension fund at the place of residence.  There will be given a calculation of how much to pay to the pension fund before the end of the year.  I recommend to pay immediately for the whole year ahead, because  at the beginning of the year, they can calculate at a single rate, and in December, a receipt with a recalculated increased amount can arrive by mail.  It was necessary now to run in December in connection with this a little. <br><br>  Next, I recommend to make a seal.  Type of mechanism and print - to your taste.  In Chelyabinsk, it costs 400 rubles and takes 3 days. <br>  Simply, without printing, it will not be possible to open a bank account on the IP  Yes, and with the seal somehow respectable, or something. <br><br>  Now the cash register.  Honestly, damn it, the feeling creeps in that this is some kind of rip-off.  15 500r worth any cash register, regardless of its size, regardless of the office in which it is sold.  Just one fixed price throughout the city.  Plus the mandatory conclusion of a contract for servicing the cash register during the year.  Another 2000r. <br><br>  It seems that preparations are finished, now let's talk about the frequency of going somewhere so that everything is legal and that no one thinks that you are hiding. <br><br>  Receipts for payment to the pension fund should be brought to the next year after the paid period from January 1 to March 20, and on their basis they will issue a certificate in the form D-11 (I don‚Äôt remember exactly the form number, but this one), which can then be presented where requested. <br><br>  Tax returns must be filed quarterly, in the first 20 days after the end of the reporting period.  With a non-zero income no documents are needed - no checks, receipts and other things.  But still, they need to be kept in a separate folder, always at the ready, in case of a possible check. <br><br>  Yes, wherever the documents are carried, you will always need copies of the passport and the documents themselves.  You can even verify them with the very inscription ‚Äúthe copy is correct,‚Äù with a list and seal. <br><br>  Phew  Finally, we have settled all the formalities and are ready to conquer the world.  And since there is no money yet, and those that are - from my own pocket, I will share some more considerations. <br><br><h1>  Income and expenses.  Problems and solutions </h1> We'll have to accept that any business in the first 2 months will be unprofitable.  There are no fairy tales here.  You can draw a clear analogy with the classic and the very first "UFO: Enemy Unknown".  The first two months are pretty hard, government funding is not enough, and research on new technologies is proceeding at an accelerated pace.  And even when it is already possible to build Laser Cannons for sale, there is simply no money for it.  Then you can breathe more or less, and already in half a year, when there are 20-30 millions on the account, everything already seems rather simple.  So, starting to engage in any business, you need to lay these two expensive months in the budget.  What can be done?  Minimize and rationalize all costs.  Before you start an advertising campaign, you need to (trite?) Explore the market.  Yandex provides this opportunity easily.  In Wordstat, the request ‚Äúfood delivery‚Äù in the Chelyabinsk region is not very popular.  There is a plus and a minus.  The good news is that there are no competitors and the cost per click is small.  And the bad thing is that the number of interested people is very small.  Therefore, in our case, the choice fell on special placement (just don‚Äôt need to click everything there now =).  It is not worth the exorbitant amount, only $ 0.8- $ 0.9, the conversion is about 20-30%.  By the way, the adjacent request "pizza delivery" is much more popular. <br>  A little go to the side, then to return to the pizza.  Initially, we had a very extensive catalog, about 5,000 products, which I needed to follow at the beginning, alone.  Plus, we do not have our own warehouse, the purchase of goods occurs after receiving the order.  In this case, I left the goods with a printed invoice, with a cash voucher.  And since we still have not very large volumes, the supplier did not give his daily updated price list.  And, unfortunately, the situation when an order came was not uncommon, I confirmed it, came to the supplier, and some items were not in stock.  I had to call the client several times and explain the situation, to renegotiate, moreover, it was necessary to make changes to the account, to interrupt the check ... A vicious circle.  To start working on the full, it was necessary to have an accurate price for each day, and in order to get it, you already had to have large volumes of purchases.  It took a lot of time and nerves.  This fact, plus the fact of the popularity of requests for pizzas, of which there are not many varieties, was made a cardinal decision to trim the main catalog to the ‚ÄúPizza and related products‚Äù type, i.e.  there will be pizza, beer, chips, other snacks, teas, juices. <br>  From this long story, you can make a simple conclusion: grasp what you can really handle.  Having taken an assortment close to the Moscow Utkonos, we simply could not cope with it.  No wonder that a lot of people work in Utkonos.  But then, with the development, it will be possible to aim a blow at expanding the range, opening several warehouses at different points in Chelyabinsk, etc. <br><br>  Another thing that needs to be done by a developing company is to prove itself from the best from the very beginning, in the very first weeks of work.  The first client should feel that he is dealing with a serious company.  To do this, you need to think over the whole scheme of work thoroughly, to provide pleasant trifles, and not to miss the obvious ones. <br><br>  The obvious little things that we have defined for themselves.  At the initial stage we take the minimum volumes. <br>  Business cards: 500pcs - 400r, 3 working days <br>  Packages with symbols: 100pcs PNVD - 1500r, 5 working days.  Here we decided to make packages not T-shirts, but low-grade polyethylene with a handle.  This is so that there will be some reuseability and advertising on the streets.  The usual good package with which you can go to the university or carry documents to work.  There are already a few happy owners walking around the city =). <br>  Next in line for implementation are the designation of the courier and the vehicle.  At the initial stage - maybe just a baseball cap with a patch, in the future a full-fledged uniform.  For the car - vinyl stickers.  Cheap and angry. <br><br>  Then start-up and out-of-the-box business need to decide where to get the first loyal customers.  That is one thing when someone has come to your site, and the other is an active user who packs 3-4 times a week.  What is the difference between them?  What step should a person take to go from the first group to the second?  I believe that he must "believe in service."  Well, that is to get experience of direct interaction with the store without much risk to yourself.  We came up with this.  A person can go to the store, order products from the ‚Äútest store‚Äù section, and at the same time he will not pay for delivery.  That is, he risks a maximum of 50 rubles and does not overpay for anything.  This is a psychological moment when you do not seem to pay anything in advance, but you still order something.  That is, you agree to give money to the store.  It‚Äôs scary to give many at once (more than 1000, so as not to pay for delivery).  Suddenly, they will bring something or something else, but you‚Äôll sort of have to pay, anyway, or swear at the store.  Buying a little (rubles per 100) and paying a comparable amount for delivery is also silly.  You can go to the nearest kiosk.  Well, our system, I think, solves both of these problems.  For example, yesterday we ordered two bottles of beer.  The person easily agreed to purchase, especially not expecting anything.  I tested the service so to speak.  We passed everything and stayed in the minus from this order, but we got another loyal customer who knows that you can buy something here and it will really bring in 2-3 hours.  And soon the New Year.  We did not earn money - we earned a reputation.  A certain loss in money equivalent can be attributed to the first two months of the enterprise. <br><br>  Go ahead.  During the very first presentation of his enterprise to anyone, <b>absolutely the</b> entire functional part should be ready, the scheme of work has been worked out.  You need to be prepared for the ‚Äúhabra effect‚Äù, when a small advertisement can immediately attract a very large number of customers.  So that did not work out like with us - when we were stupidly unable to fulfill all the orders because of technical deficiencies. <br><br>  And finally, a small remark about the store engine.  After the neudor article, most, if not all, wishes were taken into account; many bugs were found and corrected.  Made a small adjustment - now the client must register to make an order.  This was done to increase the percentage of reuse of the store.  For the same purpose, a letter about the order made now comes not only to the e-mail of the store operators, but also to the e-mail of the client.  That is, the person in the box remains a "reminder" that he once successfully used the service.  From time to time he will glance over it and maybe come back.  Well, at least the probability of this increases. <br><br><h1>  Results </h1>  As you can see, at the very beginning it is not necessary to embrace everything at once.  You need to start small and gain experience, because with 99% probability at the very beginning something will appear that you did not take into account, and you will have to quickly figure it out. <br>  There are two ways to sell your product - to form a need and to satisfy an existing need.  Formation is Apple (I hope the idea is clear).  And satisfaction is something worth staying at.  We study what is already in demand (hello wordstat) and look for ways to satisfy it. <br>  Well, plus do not forget about the little things.  Provide pleasant, and do not miss the obvious. <br><br>  All this is not really as difficult as it seems. <br><br>  PS Habrayuzer!  A big request to you: if you decide to test the functionality of the store, and decide to place an order, enter the ‚ÄúHabr‚Äù in the address so that you can easily filter these orders. <br><br>  PPS At the moment we have no agreement with any Chelyabinsk pizzeria.  If someone here is directly related to any of them, I will be glad to receive a message in PM, we would very much like to cooperate! <br><br>  PPPS did not have enough karma to post these things on a thematic blog. <br>  UPD: now enough </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/48033/">https://habr.com/ru/post/48033/</a></p>
