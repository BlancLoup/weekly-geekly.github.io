In the process of ejecting, I accidentally soldered the simplest power supply for some unclear needs. <br>  Fans of gutting junk, welcome to the sequel. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  So, in the original heap of garbage, the eye caught on such things: <br>  Domestic outbreak SEF-2, completely charred from the inside (photo from Yandex) <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/f18/b24/eb2/f18b24eb29938f0b56a9d128fea5076a.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Chinese adapter for auto 12V-USB, with a broken case, and torn parts. <br>  At the heart of the adapter DC-DC converter PJ34063. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/c62/8c9/f1f/c628c9f1fca1a5ed9660bdaf28913c9c.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  and some other BP, since the USSR, unfortunately did not take a picture.  Assembled on a nameless transformer, a diode bridge, and one good old electrolyte, about the size of a bucket.

      The cunning plan matured exactly as much as this construction was going to, because I did not see the final goal, and as they say at home it‚Äôs just so boring to sit at home. <br><br>  As a result: the filling of the flash went into the trash, to consider absolutely all the charred elements is of no interest, and there is little that survived, we take the body from the flash. <br>  The attachment shoe turned out to be removable, and there, like a poured in completely accidentally, this button got up: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/e39/df2/5c0/e39df25c0c32d35aa7805fcbb88656d0.jpg" alt="image"><br>  where it came from me - the same mystery as for you.  Apparently also from somewhere long tore. <br><br>  Next to the button, there was enough space for a diode bridge: where it was installed, I needed a screw M3 and a nut + hole in the case.  The diode bridge is the good old one, proven in the USSR for decades - KC402A. <br>  A transformer was pushed nearby, as its fasteners are just a pair of metal antennae under the bend, put it on a piece of textolite, and already textolite put it in the case. <br><br>  It looks like this now: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/0d1/2ec/e3a/0d12ece3ae0373037686653e25458745.jpg" alt="image"><br>  In the photo, the power wire is already soldered, the button, the LED in the button through the 1.3 kOhm resistor is soldered to the diode bridge. <br><br>  The next victim was an adapter for cars in the cigarette lighter 12V-USB.  He was missing half the case, the USB connector was brutally broken and crushed and turned out one capacitor.  As a donor of tanks, there was an old burned-out power unit from Thermaltake.  I just had a USB connector in stock. <br>  Capacity and connector soldered, began to think where to stick.  It turned out that the test button on the flash is perfect in the size of the usb connector, so we plug it in its place. <br>  I had to really close the case under the control LED. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/3b5/d50/0e5/3b5d500e5db7faa1b661aafcd40d99e3.jpg" alt="image"><br>  Well, put it on the glue <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/903/323/de4/903323de4ea9f7dd469195d7ef2bb554.jpg" alt="image"><br>  It remains to supply power from the diode bridge to the board and ready.  I assembled the case, I looked, I thought that for such a big shit, just 5V power supply in the USB hole - somehow it will not look.  It's easier to take a ready-made Chinese power unit, straight with a connector, 10 times smaller and at a price of 50p. <br><br>  While I was sad, I remembered that rarely, but regularly I need a small alternating voltage, and it‚Äôs just that the non-stabilized 17V permanent from the diode bridge doesn‚Äôt hurt to ‚Äújust in case‚Äù for experiments.  Under this case there was a block with terminals, 6 holes were immediately drilled and assembled. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/835/43c/e28/83543ce28bb17bae6976f7e07472d809.jpg" alt="image"><br>  He led the wires, closed the case, until the case became completely closed, and took advantage of the magical blue tape!  and just rolled up the case. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/23d/6f6/758/23d6f6758fae252e6e53645e5284817b.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  As a result, we have: 5V in the USB connector, and 17V variable + 17V constant.  (Or not 17, something I forgot, the fall on the diodes in this 0.7V bridge seems, besides, there is a 100Hz pulsation. The old one has become, forgive me.) <br><br>  So, the first test inclusion in the network - bingo!  Smoke poured down.  Well, I have never collected anything the first time.  I opened the patient, it turned out that she from the tanks (25V 1500mKf), which I extracted from the power supply unit from the computer, burned down and opened up.  Replaced by another: peace and quiet.  The restart was successful. <br><br>  Tests: the first thing to go was the USB connector.  First, the tester - 5B.  Then the usb preheater for the mug - 30 minutes of work - the insides of my unit are cold.  Next went the ancient Qtek S200 for a portion of the charge - everything is OK.  Last, but still with shaking hands, the iPhone was stuck.  The current in the circuit on all tests did not exceed 500mA. <br><br>  On this perhaps and finish. <br>  It remains only under a transparent window to put a reminder about where the connector is and you can completely close it and put it back into the drawer again. <br>  The only thing that worries me is that there is now both alternating voltage and ready stabilized 5V, limited in current, in case you need to power some mikruha. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/113269/">https://habr.com/ru/post/113269/</a></p>
