For example, the company Bosch, which is known for its devices for construction and repair, used to produce its own line of phones. <br><br>  It turns out that Energizer also makes smartphones, it specializes not only in batteries.  True, this is a very specific device.  At the Mobile World Congress was presented a very thick phone, which was called Energizer PowerMax P18K Pop.  The most important difference from other devices is the battery with a capacity of 18,000 mAh. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  If you look at the issue more thoroughly, it turns out that the phone was not created by the company itself, the brand simply issued a license to use its name Avenir Telecom.  This is a French technology company that has been producing smartphones since the beginning of 2016.

      About the phone <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20190214005055/en/">it became known</a> from a press release published a couple of weeks ago, and only then it became available for review by journalists. <br><br>  It is worth noting that this is not the first phone from Energizer.  Last year, a similar device was shown at WMC.  Which was named <a href="https://www.techradar.com/news/energizers-power-max-p16k-pro-the-phone-with-a-battery-that-could-last-a-working-week">Power Max P16K Pro</a> .  Judging by the name, it is already clear that the smartphone had a 16,000 mAh capacity battery.  The stated price tag on it is $ 738, but, unfortunately, it never entered the market - for some reason the project was closed. <br><br>  The developers have already revealed the characteristics of the smartphone.  There is nothing outstanding.  6.2-inch display with a resolution of 2220 √ó 1080, MediaTek Helio P70 chipset, 6 GB of RAM and 128 GB of main memory.  There are five cameras in total.  Three behind and two - on the front panel.  By the way, retractable cameras are a rather unusual design. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/c8a/60c/dfe/c8a60cdfe50d54b0dc42c4b1ecc5500a.jpg"><br><br>  The module for selfie includes a camera with 16 MP and 2 MP.  As for the three rear cameras, here we have 12MP + 5MP + 2MP. <br><br>  Despite the thickness, the phone has almost no frame, which is very fashionable. <br><br>  According to the company, such a powerful battery gives 90 hours of talk time, 100 hours of listening to music and 2 days of watching videos - all on one battery charge.  If the device is put and not touched, then it will last for about 50 days.  In addition, this giant battery can be used to recharge other devices via USB cable. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/cff/72a/189/cff72a1899da978380d319af97e7a75d.jpg"><br><br>  The thickness of the device is 18 mm, which is two (or even three) times larger than that of the usual smartphone.  But there are no complaints about the size - after all, the device was clearly conceived not as a designer device, which surprises everyone with its non-standard. <br><br>  By the way, the phone has no headphone input, apparently, the developers expect that everyone will use Bluetooth devices or USB adapters.  As far as you can understand, all because the company took the standard device (thin) and just added a huge battery. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/a40/2d0/b6f/a402d0b6f79090250563ab6359d54ec8.jpg"><br><br>  All phone control buttons are concentrated in the upper part. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/59a/d8b/cee/59ad8bceeba3b466c96544b8b06060b5.jpg"><br><br>  As far as we know, the phone should go on sale in June 2019.  As for the price, it is still unclear how much the device will cost.  But if it is $ 700 or so, then it is unlikely to become very popular - for such money, you can buy a regular phone plus an arbitrarily capacious trust bank. <br><br>  The phone can be useful to those of us who are often on the road, employees of organizations whose units work in places cut off from civilization, where you can not recharge every day.  As for the average hand of the user, there are doubts that such a gadget will interest the average person.  True, things can change if the cost is not very high. <br><br>  Journalists of some publications suggest that the phone may not be available for sale this time either.  And it was developed only to provide advertising to the main brand - Energizer.  On the other hand, the company introduced not only this phone, but also the second one, which is an exact copy of the first one, but without a massive battery.  The second one will not exactly raise the HYIP wave, so this time there is a chance that the phones will hit the shelves of electronics stores.  Where the devices will be sold is also unknown. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/442146/">https://habr.com/ru/post/442146/</a></p>
