  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Coursera for musicians: a brief overview of the courses</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  On the training system Coursera on Habr√© wrote repeatedly.  And even brought the announcements of some courses.  I decided to select those of them that may be interesting and useful to people working with sound: musicians, composers, sound engineers, both experienced and just thinking to take the first steps.  Courses offered will help: <br><ul><li>  familiarize yourself with the physical basics of sound and acoustics; </li><li>  get a basic or expand the understanding of the theory of music, psychoacoustics, etc .; </li><li>  get acquainted with digital sound processing, software tools and processing mechanisms; </li><li>  learn how to write your simplest sound processing software; </li><li>  Finally, learn to play the guitar, jazz improvisation, rehearsal management and other interesting things. </li></ul><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  For those not aware, <a href="https://www.coursera.org/">Coursera</a> is one of the sites with a bunch of diverse distance courses from large (and not so) foreign universities.  Each course starts at a certain time, weekly there are new video lectures and homework assignments.  If you are not filonite and do your homework successfully, at the end of the course you will receive an electronic certificate of completion (which, however, we can find little use for).  Most courses are in English, but there are some other languages. <br><br>  All courses described here can be divided into 3 groups: technical (1, 2, 7), art and humanities (3-6), for programmers (7, 8).  The list is sorted by start date of training. <br><ol><li>  <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/185794/">Basics of audio and sound engineering.</a>  <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/185794/">Part 1: Musical Sound and Electronics</a> </li><li>  <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/185794/">Introduction to the production of music</a> </li><li>  <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/185794/">Jazz improvisation</a> </li><li>  <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/185794/">Introductory guitar course</a> </li><li>  <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/185794/">Songwriting</a> </li><li>  <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/185794/">Basics of rehearsing teams</a> </li><li>  <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/185794/">Review of music technology</a> </li><li>  <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/185794/">Introduction to programming for musicians and digital performers</a> </li></ol><br><br><a name="audiomusicengpart1"></a><h4>  Basics of audio and sound engineering.

      The 6-week course covers the theoretical foundations of sound and acoustics, as well as signals and electronics in their relationship to music.  The course program covers selected topics of wave theory, electricians, and radio electronics.  Judging by the program, the creators' favorite instrument is the electric guitar.  And the final project is a guitar amplifier that you can do with your own hands. <br><br>  <b>Approximate loading:</b> 4-5 hours a week. <br>  <b>Base University:</b> University of Rochester <br><br>  <a href="https://www.coursera.org/course/audiomusicengpart1">Go to the course page.</a> <br><br><a name="musicproduction"></a><h4>  Introduction to the production of music </h4><br>  I really didn‚Äôt want to use the word ‚Äúproduction‚Äù, but it describes the process more succinctly than ‚Äúproduction‚Äù.  Or just more ‚Äúfashionable‚Äù.  This course will tell about the sequence of actions when creating a sound recording from direct recording to editing and mixing, as well as the necessary hardware and software tools used in the process.  Lecturers will talk about recording equipment, various types of treatments and effects, a separate lesson will be devoted to synthesizers. <br><br>  <b>Classes start</b> on July 19th. <br>  <b>Course duration:</b> 6 weeks <br>  <b>Approximate loading:</b> 6-8 hours a week. <br>  <b>Basic University:</b> Berklee College of Music <br><br>  <a href="https://www.coursera.org/course/musicproduction">Go to the course page.</a> <br><br><a name="improvisation"></a><h4>  Jazz improvisation </h4><br>  The creator of this course will try to teach you what, it would seem, can only be given from above.  You will learn about the musical and mental skills that an improviser combines while playing.  The lecturer will talk about the creation of logical musical phrases, the choice of musical steps in different harmonic situations, aspects of the use of music theory in the game, and even a little bit about how to put soul and emotion into performance.  The course is designed for those who know how to play any musical instrument at least at the intermediate level.  You will also need at least a simple microphone to record your homework. <br><br>  <b>Classes start</b> on July 19th. <br>  <b>Course duration:</b> 5 weeks <br>  <b>Approximate loading:</b> 6-8 hours a week. <br>  <b>Basic University:</b> Berklee College of Music <br><br>  <a href="https://www.coursera.org/course/improvisation">Go to the course page.</a> <br><br><a name="guitar"></a><h4>  Introductory guitar course </h4><br>  Unlike the previous one, this course is designed for beginners.  You will learn how to choose your first acoustic or electric guitar, how to tune it, learn the simplest techniques and techniques of the game, as well as the basics of music theory.  In addition, get information on the effects and sound amplification for electric and acoustic guitars.  To record homework you need a simple microphone. <br><br>  <b>Classes start</b> on July 19th. <br>  <b>Course duration:</b> 6 weeks <br>  <b>Approximate loading:</b> 6-8 hours a week. <br>  <b>Basic University:</b> Berklee College of Music <br><br>  <a href="https://www.coursera.org/course/guitar">Go to the course page.</a> <br><br><a name="songwriting"></a><h4>  Songwriting </h4><br>  Perhaps the most distant from the subject of Habra course of all listed here.  Well, quite humanitarian.  But I was so intrigued that I signed up.  The creator of the course promises to tell you how to create and rhyme lyrics for songs more effectively, how to go from idea to completed song, how to achieve unity of words and music and bring the author's idea and emotions to the listener.  According to the creators, music education is not necessary, but you still need a microphone, because  again you have to write down your sketches and creations. <br><br>  <b>Classes start</b> on July 19th. <br>  <b>Course duration:</b> 6 weeks <br>  <b>Approximate loading:</b> 6-8 hours a week. <br>  <b>Basic University:</b> Berklee College of Music <br><br>  <a href="https://www.coursera.org/course/songwriting">Go to the course page.</a> <br><br><a name="musicensembles"></a><h4>  Basics of rehearsing teams </h4><br>  The course is useful for those who lead musical groups from small groups to choirs and orchestras.  Perhaps there are such on Habr√©.  The course covers the skills necessary for effective leadership, including the organization of the rehearsal process, the basics of conducting, musical expression, hearing training, interaction with performers, etc. <br><br>  <b>Beginning of studies:</b> August. <br>  <b>Course duration:</b> 8 weeks <br>  <b>Approximate loading:</b> 4-6 hours a week. <br>  <b>Base University:</b> The University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill <br><br>  <a href="https://www.coursera.org/course/music-ensembles">Go to the course page.</a> <br><br><a name="musictech"></a><h4>  Review of music technology </h4><br>  Unlike the previous 5, this course is for tru music programmers and creators of electronic music.  Dedicated mainly to digital audio technologies: workstations (DAW), interfaces, synthesis, recording and processing.  And even a little bit will have to be done in Python in a special software environment, designed to work with one of the digital workstations. <br><br>  <b>Beginning of studies:</b> August 26 <br>  <b>Course duration:</b> 6 weeks <br>  <b>Approximate loading:</b> 5-7 hours a week. <br>  <b>Base University:</b> Georgia Institute of Technology <br><br>  <a href="https://www.coursera.org/course/musictech">Go to the course page.</a> <br><br><a name="chuck101"></a><h4>  Introduction to programming for musicians and digital performers </h4><br>  Another course for music programmers and creators of electronic music.  Dedicated to the multimedia programming language ChucK, more about which you can read in the article <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/120145/">ChucK - we program the sound</a> .  During training, you will learn about the syntax, capabilities and various modules of the language.  Special guests of the lectures will be the creators of the language. <br><br>  <b>Beginning of studies:</b> October. <br>  <b>Course duration:</b> 8 weeks <br>  <b>Approximate loading:</b> 2-4 hours a week. <br>  <b>Undergraduate:</b> California Institute of the Arts <br><br>  <a href="https://www.coursera.org/course/chuck101">Go to the course page.</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/185794/">https://habr.com/ru/post/185794/</a></p>
