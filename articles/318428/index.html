Some jamb often happens on them: then there will be more people than planned, the light will be turned off, the most dramatic - alcohol will not be brought up on time.  Or on the contrary, sound will get drunk and lock up in their room.  Therefore, animators carry with them "emergency" suitcases - things where games are very compactly packed, which can help out in any company in any situation.  Plus, they know a lot of entertainments, which you can play just like that, without everything. <br><br>  I collected something similar, but where, where more compact, when I was going to Greenland.  Well and, actually, now I will show how we use board games component by component, without actually playing. <br><br>  In the end there is a minimum set of pictures with games in order to save to the phone for you.  Therefore, the post is a shade of preparation for the new year.

      So, the first basis for good compression - many things require the same set of random number generators and timers.  So, you can do, for example, with one d20 cube and one hourglass.  Or even phone, if you want to achieve lossy compression. <a name="habracut"></a><br><br><h2>  Normal set </h2><br>  In Moscow, Sergey Melimuk, our chief corporate officer (a guy from the TV who led Crocodile on MUZ-TV for several years) uses such a huge suitcase: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/408/cbe/5f8/408cbe5f868a4476919b169ac4fd698e.jpeg"><br><br>  Here is what you can put on one side: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/bc6/a73/f62/bc6a73f62ead4900b6ff853b5c22401f.jpeg"><br><br>  Here, as you can see, 1-2 large boxes of games for up to 10 people are selected.  On the other hand, it fits the fact that for companies it is more, for example, like this: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/4a6/d44/fe2/4a6d44fe2a34409da9ccc0dc3e853c3e.jpeg"><br><br>  That is, side A is for the main business, side B is for a situation when something went wrong.  Side A can be filled with other things - the form of the animator climbs there, prizes, all sorts of small things for tournaments.  For example, on departure on the big tournament on the Crocodile.  Here I must say that the task of compression for him and the Moscow team is not worth it.  The task is not to continue props, not to forget anything important and not to break something along the way.  Therefore, a suitcase with rigid walls was chosen that can be shaken and beaten.  He is very hard to slam (which the participants in expensive events regularly try to do) is too bright and noticeable.  Gathers in advance, contains the pre-cached side of B. Actually, this is where the most interesting things are. <br><br><h2>  Side B - emergency dialing </h2><br>  Begin compression.  The first rule of the animator - "To hell with the rules."  It is performed both figuratively and literally.  Opened the box - hid the rules in the cover.  Then I fastened the lid to the bottom from the bottom to make one detail - otherwise, by the end of the game store, the lid would simply not be found. <br><br>  Accordingly, for the suitcase, we get rid of all the rules and all the boxes. <br><br>  Next field.  Paradoxical thing - the box often has the size of three factors: <br><br><ul><li>  Under the playing field </li><li>  And big enough that people do not think that they are buying something small for 1000-1500 rubles. </li><li>  Plus, people are used to the fact that gifts have a certain large size. </li></ul><br>  As a result of a regular evolution, all small boxes became extinct.  Or adapted - they grew the playing field, in the size of which the box is made. <br><br>  <b>By minimal shifts in game mechanics, almost any sociable game with a field can be transformed into a game without a field.</b>  Yes, people love to move chips and look at the beautiful piece on the table, but, by and large, it is not needed.  Since igromechanically the field most often acts as a complex counter, we can: <br><br><ol><li>  Just counting points on a piece of paper (but this is not cool) - or blackboard </li><li>  Use twenty-sided cubes as counters, setting them with the right edge (there are even special spindown models where randomness is reduced, but the numbers follow in a spiral, therefore it is very convenient to count the cube). </li><li>  Or, if the game allows - to accumulate some items from players - for example, give them quiz cards with questions that they answered correctly.  At the end of the game, these cards are simply considered. </li></ol><br>  Therefore, the field, too, immediately fuck.  And everything else associated with them.  Actually, the essence of the game remains.  Here is what happens, for example: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/aa4/0ea/485/aa40ea4854a24e988e77e87aa6e90c90.jpeg"><br><br>  To play Activi only with cards - but how can you do something.  The field is needed only for the mechanics of ‚Äúwhat will happen if my chip treads on someone else's chip‚Äù, visual observation of the progress and generation of random numbers.  The last (which task to pull) replaces another generator - D6, that is, our cube. <br><br><h2>  Extreme Compression Kit </h2><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/4ac/dae/a4e/4acdaea4e1da46ce87c30e0869522cbe.jpeg"><br><br>  That's what I was going on the road somehow. <br><br>  <b>Two white decks on the top are pieces of the game ‚ÄúJust a minute‚Äù.</b>  There you have to walk across the field and perform strange tasks, or answer quiz questions.  The most interesting part is the duel.  These are mini-games like armwrestling, hide and seek and other things for 30-50 seconds for two. <br><br>  The first deck - duel minute.  They can be pulled like forfeits in the right situation.  The second deck - Quiz Minutochki: on each card for two questions - one with the answer choices, the second free.  The correct answer is given in bold to them - one player reads out, the rest answer: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/574/9ea/f4a/5749eaf4ab8549a786f86ceb791cf026.jpeg"><br><br>  Everything, already one game is ready - you can just cut into a quiz even in a minibus.  Actually, we did this once, while we were driving to the ‚ÄúNeuromonikon‚Äù from Moscow to the Tula Region.  You can even pre-select the most stubborn questions - ‚ÄúWhat mountain was the highest before the discovery of Everest?  ‚ÄúEverest!‚Äù <br><br>  <b>Further cards with a yellow edging are the base cards of the game ‚ÄúBet‚Äù.</b>  There are green cloth, a bunch of components, washable plates, chips - in general, a quiz, more similar in wealth to the whole casino.  Actually, that is why it is very popular in the USA - it got very cultural code there.  On each card there are questions, where is the answer - a specific number ( <abbr title="18 pieces, 10 on the front paws and 8 on the back">How many fingers does a cat have?;</abbr> <abbr title="According to the Ministry of Internal Affairs - 3.5 minutes">What is the average interval between thefts in Russia (in minutes) for 2012?</abbr> ). <br><br>  In the original, you need to record the answer on a small washable tablet, then bet on other answers - and then compare who got closer.  On the road, just write on paper and compare who got better - minus half the bet mechanics.  If you want to have fun - here's a whole <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/company/mosigra/blog/228533/">post with questions</a> from this thing. <br><br>  <b>Then a deck of "Ruff"</b> .  These are tasks that in the original must be done or drunk.  Yes, you can just play Ruff without alcohol (this is very, very cruel), but we do it a little differently.  In sets of animators, this piece is needed as complex tear-off forfeits, and it is embedded as a fine into other mechanics.  Quiz - answered the question, went on, did not answer - do the task from this deck.  And the tasks from simple ones like ‚Äúturn around its axis 10 times in 2 minutes‚Äù to ‚ÄúSend SMS‚Äú I have two strips, what should I do? ‚ÄùTo the number that other players call‚Äù.  One of the brightest entertainments of the New Year corporate parties is to play "Do not rock the boat" (a game with a bunch of penguins, which should be put on the very unstable deck of the ship) on the tasks of the Ruff.  Dropped the penguins - do it.  He is well combined with wooden towers on the same principle. <br><br>  <b>Then my love is a boom deck</b> .  ‚ÄúBoom‚Äù, he is ‚ÄúPapers‚Äù, he is ‚ÄúHat‚Äù, he is also ‚ÄúCap‚Äù - this is the coolest game for a company where people know how to think.  It is for this reason that he follows other word games on the hit list.  More precisely - because it can not be played at the podshofof.  Even slightly.  And this factor is a watershed in the social games.  In the game, it is necessary to explain 40 characters with words, then in the second round of the same - only with gestures (this is simply because the list was already remembered in the first round), and then in general with one word.  In addition to the deck, nothing is needed - the cards are here as a means of hiding information.  You can play without it - so I <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/company/mosigra/blog/207906/">wrote</a> last year, how - and there is also a completely playable list of scientists to play at home on holidays. <br><br>  <b>Next - white cards</b> .  This is our standard prototyping tool.  Be sure to still have a pencil to them, a small one, or a pen.  I always have a pair in my travel bag to fill in forms at the border, so they are not included in the set.  Cards are needed to quickly make the game in place.  As developers, we are able to do it - to assemble a suitable mechanic for a company.  You can just write on them, it is often more important to have 100 pieces of paper with the same shirt. <br><br>  <b>The last one is a box of danetks in a compact edition</b> (you cannot buy them in this form, but there are a lot of regular sets).  If I want to take a company, but not play myself, I just give them a box in my hands and leave.  Hours for two - naglushnyak.  They also play well in the car, even with the driver.  The next day, players usually begin to read not the super-singing stories from this set, but to bring their dankets is very cool. <br><br>  What is not included - <b>Evolution</b> , I take it when a small company is planned.  There are only two decks like here in size.  Very cool thing for the road because of replayability, and is suitable for children.  Only difficult to explain. <br><br>  <b>Next chips and dice</b> .  Chips - they are the same in all games.  We cut half of them together with the field.  The rest serve as counters, and a strong variety is not needed.  But I usually take a few so-called "counters" - simple identical chips - with me.  Painted wooden cubes would fit more, but these things are transparent, that is, they allow you to see what is under them.  Therefore, I drive them. <br><br>  <b>Timer</b> - everything is simple, one hourglass is from the Middle Kingdom.  I have a whole compartment in my kit for development, it's not a problem to get it.  You, most likely, will not have them - or there will be too long, large and terrible pharmacies.  Looking for a 30-second.  Instead, the timer on the phone does an excellent job, although the timer on the phone is the last thing I would like to see in a board game, for example, on a swinging sun deck.  Very knocks out of the atmosphere. <br><br>  From the set, due to the timer, one of the best social pieces falls out, which fits simply always - ‚ÄúAnswer me in 5 seconds‚Äù.  But there is a complex timer with a spiral descent of balls and a cool gurgling sound: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/38f/437/6cc/38f4376ccfde4b77bda290758f658899.jpeg"><br><br>  In theory, instead you can count on your fingers, but I didn‚Äôt take it to Greenland - the fig is too long. <br><br>  Total - this is the set for the company.  A boom for situations where there are a lot of people unrealistic, Ruff - forfeits or big companies, ‚ÄúJust a minute‚Äù and ‚ÄúBet‚Äù - just play quizzes with different difficulty. <br><br>  If there is still a place, I take these things: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/db1/03c/ca3/db103cca3e7f46518489f3187fc8dfc1.jpeg"><br><br>  Here the sets of ‚ÄúRoad games‚Äù, ‚ÄúHome games‚Äù and ‚ÄúHome games‚Äù are cards with the rules of different games from Tsarist Russia through the USSR to the present day.  Everything an animator needs to occupy any company.  Since I already remember half of these games, the sets are taken only for situations when someone will help me to give a card to him.  Although the children once rescued, when at someone else's event, due to a bus break, I had to entertain 35 children for 60 minutes.  It was terrible. <br><br>  Above, the yellow garbage is the cards from ‚ÄúLies, Travels, Beard‚Äù on the ‚ÄúFriday‚Äù show.  There's a fact about the trip and the answer, so it is or not.  Very, infection, large - there is a beard on the back side to take a selfie with her.  Inside the city you can carry, then - no. <br><br>  The red box - ‚ÄúComparit USSR‚Äù, a game about comparing prices for old Soviet goods.  A sort of sorting bubble: it is necessary to lay out cards in a row, trying to get to where this product is at a price.  I did not believe it - you can open two adjacent cards and see the prices.  They opened it in vain - pull fant from the Ruff ... There is the same Comparity about the year of the films and all sorts of things under a different name, but with the same mechanics about the size-age of animals.  I like the USSR version, because it tunes in a certain way - a lot of stories are connected with each item, and on the way this is the very thing. <br><br>  Road "Crocodile" do not take, it replaces the deck "Boom" with a vengeance.  But judging by the demand this year, the thing was very successful.  Even on the road, you can catch "7 by 9", the Hive (he even has a bag for compaction), very cool, but complex "Agents" and "Heads" for children.  Well, and then - the usual compact edition, we have a selection <a href="http://www.mosigra.ru/allgames/voyage/">here</a> . <br><br>  Looked into Sergey Melimuk's suitcase, he is carrying Udarnik, Erundopel, Friday along with his caps on the next corporate party (these are Inglorious bastards, I make them from empty cards), the same ‚ÄúFalse-beard-travel‚Äù, mafia cards , large danetki, a deck of an imaginarium without a field, a crocodile road, Tik-so-boom without a box (only bombs and cards), a deck and a ‚ÄúAnswer in 5 seconds‚Äù timer. <br><br>  If you decide to buy - keep in mind that it is worth 15 thousand rubles to gather up such components, so I would dwell on Boom, Ruff and one of the quizzes.  If you take Minute just for the road - the Ruff is not needed, there are some tasks there, but not such tear-off ones. <br><br><h2>  So that you do not leave the post empty-handed, I will teach you five simple games </h2><br>  Here are 5 of 33 Travel Game cards.  We are interested here in those who will go to the country, at home and so on: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/833/ef5/98c/833ef598c48840009198d72c370b8b1b.png"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/8a6/af1/478/8a6af14783e2440093a45759df45f513.png"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/88a/da3/abf/88ada3abfc0b41148befd5fdda3a3506.png"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/3d9/b8e/9c7/3d9b8e9c7a1d42c8a4283e72f32b25de.png"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/858/a70/4ba/858a704ba8024c479e5f9da1e7c0a46c.png"><br><br>  You should also pick up these pictures on the phone, they will be useful for playing in the car, for example: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/8de/49a/80f/8de49a80f8b34f9bb5a7aa55b272a002.png"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/0b6/9f5/300/0b69f5300ae54078a3e6f69fb189069d.png"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/a2d/ae6/c35/a2dae6c357474ba088f37c3fd644fa57.png"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/485/b6a/bf0/485b6abf035c43c28effeeafd6270cde.png"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/609/dc8/b5f/609dc8b5fd7942c2a089e0063e940e79.png"><br>  <i>Yes, he was the old troll</i> <br><br>  Like this.  So again: you can take the most delicious things from different games and cross the mechanics.  For example, doing tasks with fines for not answering questions or destroying a wooden tower, using cards of different games in others (for example, a Boom deck for playing with pieces of paper on the forehead), and so on.  Most of the party games use similar mechanics, so the component base is the same. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/318428/">https://habr.com/ru/post/318428/</a></p>
