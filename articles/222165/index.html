  <section class="page js-page"><h1>The standoff of Apple and Google in the gaming application sector</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Tablets and smartphones have long conquered the whole world, the market has grown to incredible volumes.  His lion's share belongs to mobile games, they generate most of the profits. <br><br>  The alignment of forces in the global market is the same: the Google operating system retains leadership in the number of devices, but the Apple platform brings more revenue.  This is explained by the fact that smartphones and tablets with the Android operating system are on average much cheaper than Apple devices, that is, their owners are less solvent.  This statement is true even for developed countries, including the United States.  But in some countries, Android devices are so popular that they overtake iOS and profit, for example, in the Asian region. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/7a9/c4b/d18/7a9c4bd18901bdce3b39d4ff422954e4.jpg" alt="image"><br>  Consider the situation in different countries in more detail: <br><br>  - In the US, Google owns more than 50% of the market in the smartphone sector, and iOS accounts for 44%.  Nevertheless, three-quarters of all profits come from the iPhone.  But this does not mean that users like Android apps less - by the number of downloads, Google Play is ahead of the App Store.  The lion's share of profits on both platforms is given by microtransactions in f2p games: 86% on iOS and 94% on Android.  Developers still prefer the "apple" operating system, as evidenced by the release of several game hits only on this platform.  But, as analysts say, the situation is gradually changing, Android is catching up with iOS.

      - The role of Canada in the gaming market is quite curious: developers often use its market for testing and running in applications before placing them in US stores.  The markets of both countries are quite similar in all parameters except volume, so the risk when launching a new game in Canada is much lower. <br><br>  - The Mexican mobile sector is experiencing rapid growth, this country is now on the 23rd place in the world in terms of market volume. <br><br>  - China is very unusual in that its market volume is an impressive $ 1.8 billion, but Google is not officially represented in this country.  But this does not mean that all profits belong to Apple, for example, 73% of all mobile devices have the Android operating system.  This paradox is explained by the legislation of the country: the applications for this platform are presented not in Google Play, but in numerous local stores.  In addition, piracy is widespread in China, which deters many Western publishers. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  - Japan in terms of market volume strongly takes the second place after the USA.  Users pay a lot of attention to their smartphones and tablets and are much more willing to pay for games and in-app purchases.  For example, the average income per user is kept at $ 6.34, while in the United States this figure is more than two and a half times lower.  In addition, in Japan one of the lowest prices for acquiring a user is $ 1.86 (according to Distimo). <br><br>  - In South Korea, the balance of power is completely on the side of Google: Android brings more than 80% of the profits.  In many ways, this advantage is due to the local company Samsung, which produces the most popular devices on this platform.  In addition, the Korean market is one of the fastest growing in the world. <br><br>  - The largest market sector in Europe belongs to the UK.  IOS reigns here, and the Android platform accounts for less than a quarter of all profits.  The high welfare of the population explains quite large spending gamers in applications.  The British are known worldwide for their love of football, so the games on this subject are most in demand here and bring a huge amount of money to the developers. <br><br>  What to expect in the future?  How to change the balance of power?  Which regions should developers target?  These questions concern many, but it is almost impossible to make an accurate forecast.  Revenues from mobile games in one country or another largely depend on the economic situation.  Vigorous developing countries can be a tasty morsel for developers, as entering such markets is among the first to help break the big score.  Now many experts are betting on Brazil, Russia and China.  As for the platforms, in developing countries almost always the leaders of Android.  But this does not mean that Apple is losing its position - in many developed regions, the share of profits from iOS games continues to grow. <br><br>  With the support of <a href="https://cpiera.com/">www.cpiera.com</a> (exchange of buying and selling iOS and Android installations, working on the CPI-model) <br><br>  Source: venturebeat.com <br><br>  <a href="http://venturebeat.com/2014/04/25/apple-vs-google-a-world-view-on-the-mobile-gaming-war/">venturebeat.com/2014/04/25/apple-vs-google-a-world-view-on-the-mobile-gaming-war</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/222165/">https://habr.com/ru/post/222165/</a></p>
