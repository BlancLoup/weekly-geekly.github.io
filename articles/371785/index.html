The chief designer was Yuri Yakovlevich Bazilevsky, and his deputy - Bashir Iskandarovich Ramaev.  The Strela computer belonged to the class of large machines with a highly developed and logically complete structure.  This provided greater performance in solving complex and cumbersome tasks.  In addition, "Strela" was also the firstborn among the machines produced by the industry mass.  Previous models were made in single copies. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/1c3/6fc/76e/1c36fc76eecc4a1ea78ee21dc3b131c7.jpg"><br><br><a name="habracut"></a>  In the early 50s.  B.I.  Rameev began the development of a draft design of a digital electronic computer.  After consideration by the technical council of SKB-245, the project of the scientist was approved.  It is noteworthy that this happened on the first day when the future chief designer of the machine, Yu.Ya.  Bazilevsky, appointed head of the department of digital machines SKB-245.

Doctor of Technical Sciences.  Winner of the Stalin Prize. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/d6d/cda/4ff/d6dcda4ff85e42a3bdbcb770e0ac28d0.jpg"><br><br>  <b>Yuri Yakovlevich Bazilevsky</b> (1912 - 1983) - Soviet scientist, chief designer of the Strela computer and the automated computer system for the Dal-111 air defense system.  He was a hero of Socialist Labor, winner of the Stalin Prize. <br><br>  The development team of the Strela computer consisted of specialists: chief designer Yu.Ya.  Basilewski, Deputy.  chief designer B.AND.  Rameeva, constructors G.M.  Prokudaeva, A.M.  Litvinova, D.A.  Zhuchkova, A.V.  Shileyko, the main performers of A.P.  Tsygankina, N.B.  Trubnikova, B.F.  Melnikova, GD  Monakhov, I.F.  Lygina, L.A.  Larionova, A.M.  Larionova, E.T.  Semenova and others. <br><br><h4>  Structure of SKB-24 </h4><br>  In the late 40s - early 50s.  SKB-245 was created on the basis of the Moscow Plant of Calculating Machines (SAM).  This abbreviation was interpreted as a special design office for the development and production of computer equipment and military control systems.  The organization had 6 departments, which were denoted by numbers (due to complete secrecy). <br><br>  In the 1st department they ensured the secrecy of the developments and verified all the structures.  Every day, employees of other departments were given suitcases with papers and stitched, numbered, sealed notebooks, which at the end of the working day were surrendered.  In the 2nd division, work was carried out on analog computing facilities.  The development of the Strela computer was performed by the 3rd department, under the guidance of Yu. Ya.  Bazilevsky.  The 4th department was mathematical, was under the guidance of I.A.  Gluzberg (and later - DA Zhuchkov).  He was involved in the development of standard programs for Strela and performed evaluations of operations.  Material support lay on the 5th division.  And the 6th ‚Äî developed a differential analyzer, led by A.A.  The poor.  Over time, other departments were organized. <br><br><h4>  Development of "Arrow" </h4><br>  Work on the creation of "Arrows" was carried out with incredible enthusiasm.  The interest of the staff was fueled by a kind of rivalry with the ITMVT of the USSR Academy of Sciences, where BESM was developed at the same time. <br><br>  Mikhail Avksentyevich Lesechko - director of the plant CAM and the head of SKB-245, gave all his inimitable talent of the organizer to work.  For a few nights, equipment was installed to cool large rooms in which assembled Strela devices were installed for debugging. <br><br>  In the 6th department, directly involved in the development of "Arrows", there were several laboratories.  B.I.  Rameev headed the laboratory responsible for the arithmetic unit and the block of RAM, as well as the multiplication-division device.  B. Zaitsev developed the addition / subtraction unit.  There was also a GM laboratory.  Prokudaeva, who developed external storage devices on electronic tubes.  External devices involved the laboratory Trubnikov. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/802/d9a/f92/802d9af92b0947bc8051197debe97e92.jpg"><br><br>  <i>In the photo the main creators of the machine "Strela": B.I.</i>  <i>Rameev, V.V.</i>  <i>Aleksandrov, Yu.Ya.</i>  <i>Bazilevsky, D.A.</i>  <i>Zhuchkov, A.P.</i>  <i>Tsygankin, stand Yu.F.</i>  <i>Shcherbakov, N.B.</i>  <i>Trubnikov, G.M.</i>  <i>Prokudayev, B.F.</i>  <i>Melnikov, G.Ya.</i>  <i>Markov and I.F.</i>  <i>Lygin.</i> <br><br>  It is also worth noting that the development of "Arrows" took place in record time.  The project started at the beginning of the fiftieth year.  At the end of 1951, the documentation was transferred to the CAM plant and already in 1952 the first copy of the machine was ready for debugging.  The employees of SKB-245 developed not only logic, but designed, counted all the elements. <br><br>  In 1953, a working computer "Strela" was presented to the Stalin Prize Commission.  She managed to bypass BESM Lebedev due to greater readiness for industrial production.  In addition, the development of "Arrows" required less money.  Therefore, the prize was given to SKB-245. <br><br><h4>  Architecture and working principles </h4><br>  About 6,000 electron tubes and several tens of thousands of semiconductor rectifiers (diodes) were used in Strela. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/d91/f15/dcd/d91f15dcd5b44c178b4dc434eb0454a3.jpg"><br><br>  <i>In progress</i> <br><br>  Machine "Strela" was assembled on three main racks, arranged in the shape of the letter "P".  It was divided into an arithmetic unit rack (right), an external drive rack and some auxiliary devices (left), and a random access memory and control rack (middle).  Manual control, data entry and output devices were located in the center.  He allowed the operator to start and stop the machine, monitor the progress of the program commands, and also enter into the operational memory and derive individual numbers (data and commands) from it while the machine was stopped. <br><br>  The device for the preparation of punched cards consisted of a keyboard device and an input punch.  This allowed the operator using the keys to fill in the necessary information on the punched cards.  After that, the prepared deck was removed from the input punch and placed in the input device (reading) of the machine.  Next, the data were entered into the random access memory (capacity up to 2048 words).  The results of solving the problem were transmitted in the form of electrical signals to the output perforator and were represented there as a system of holes on punched cards. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/595/dc9/b75/595dc9b759c44b19987779639c518d35.jpg"><br><br>  <i>Magnetic tape from the computer "Strela", width 125 mm <a href="https://polymus.ru/ru/museum/fonds/stock/lenta-magnitnaya-ot-evm-strela-116613/">Polytechnical Museum</a></i> <br><br>  The performance of the machine reached 2000 triaddress operations per second.  The arithmetic unit performed arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication) and a number of additional operations (subtraction of the modules of numbers, shift of the number, selection of part of the number, etc.). <br><br>  The external storage unit had two blocks with a magnetic tape 125 mm wide and up to 100 m long. The numbers were arranged on a magnetic tape in groups of zones.  That is, there could be 253 zones of different sizes on each tape, with up to 100,000 numbers placed on each tape.  In total, the external drive could hold up to 200,000 numbers. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/489/e53/dcf/489e53dcf70a416dbc8e87fc5aec477c.jpg"><br><br>  <i>The principle of interaction of computer nodes (Journal "Knowledge is power" ‚Ññ7, 1956)</i> <br><br>  A special feature of Strela was the flexibility of the command system.  It was possible to create libraries of applied programs of various thematic areas of up to 100 million teams.  This was done thanks to the presence of several types of group arithmetic and logical operations, conditional transitions, replaceable standard programs, a system of control tests and organizing programs.  "Arrow" was a model of original solutions in the element base.  In this computer the matrix execution of the multiplication unit on diodes was first realized.  Also for the first time, operational memory was used on 43 specialized storage cathode-ray tubes.  In addition, in the last modification, a 4096-word drive appeared on a magnetic drum with a rotational speed of 6000 rpm. <br><br>  <b>Characteristics of the computer "Strela"</b> <br><br>  Speed: up to 2000 triaddress / sec; <br>  Main tact: 500 ¬µs; <br>  Team Addresses: 12-bit; <br>  Floating point operations (35 is the mantissa, 6 is the order; 1 character); <br>  Power consumption: 150 kW (75 kW - processor); <br>  ROM: on semiconductor diodes with a capacity of 15 standard subroutines of 16 commands and 256 operands; <br>  RAM: 20 Œºs; <br>  Occupied area: 300 m <sup>2</sup> (of which 150 m <sup>2</sup> is a processor); <br>  Average time of useful work: 15-18 hours per day; <br>  External storage: 2 tape drives with a capacity of 1.5 million words; <br>  Element base: 6200 lamps and 60,000 semiconductor diodes; <br>  Software: library of subroutines, some of which are sewn into permanent memory. <br><br>  On the computer "Strela" practiced the first domestic methods and programming methods, including in the operator form. <br><br><h4>  Memory and information structure </h4><br>  The Strela computer memory had a volume of 2,048 cells of 43 bits, numbered from left to right from 0 to 42. As a result, the high-level digit is number 0, and the younger one is 43. Access to the memory cells was carried out using 2-bit addresses.  When the high order bit of the address was zero, the corresponding cell was accessed.  The unit value of this digit was used when working with external devices and for accessing the permanent memory. <br><br>  Each memory cell housed a number or command code.  In the "zero" cells contained a zero value, respectively, the entry in this cell was ignored. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/2bd/bc0/1ec/2bdbc01ec3b2499db0ed18bbae2bacd7.png"><br><br>  <i>Sketch "Arrows"</i> <br><br>  To simplify the recording of information stored in memory and addresses, used octal number system. <br><br>  The machine processed floating-point numbers in binary and decimal number systems.  When writing in machine format, the binary number with a floating point consisted of the mantissa sign (bit 0), the absolute value of the mantissa (bits 1-35), the order sign (bit 36), and the absolute value of the order (bits 37-42). <br><br>  The decimal number with a floating point also consisted of the sign of the mantissa (bit 0), the absolute value of the mantissa (bits 1-36), the sign of the order (bit 37), and the absolute value of the order (bits 38-42).  Each decimal digit of the mantissa was recorded in binary coded decimal code, 4 bits per digit.  But the order remained in binary form and in absolute value could not exceed 19. <br><br>  The size of the mantissa was always less than 1 and only its fractional part was stored in the memory.  The whole was considered equal to zero. <br><br>  The external memory consisted of two reels of magnetic tape, each of which was divided into zones, where from 1 to 2048 numbers could be written.  The zone of the first magnetic tape had octal numbers from 4001 to 4777, and the second tape had from 5001 to 5777. Information was recorded and recorded using special commands. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/298/b9a/31d/298b9a31d79f4b1f9a6b118a5a902004.jpg"><br><br>  <i>Computer "Strela"</i> <br><br><h4>  Command system </h4><br>  Commands were selected from memory and executed sequentially.  The natural order of execution could be changed using the transition command. <br><br>  Strela was a three-address computing machine (each command code was assigned three addresses of operands).  Command code structure: <br>  - first address (bits 0-11); <br>  - the second address (bits 12-23); <br>  - the third address (bits 24-35); <br>  - check mark (rank 36); <br>  - opcode (bits 37-42). <br><br>  A control sign of 0 was ignored. When it was 1, when the corresponding toggle switch was turned on at the control panel, the machine stopped after each execution of the command containing it. <br><br>  The octal number system was used when writing commands.  The team was written in a similar form: <br><br>  <i>0065 0231 1101 0 01</i> <br><br>  Checking any conditions in the car occurred on a special feature, usually denoted by the letter <i>w</i> .  This feature was formed during the execution of certain commands (addition, comparison, etc.), and then used in the conditional jump command.  If the sign was not formed by the command, then after execution it was reset.  Therefore, the conditional branch command should have been executed immediately after the formation of the analyzed trait. <br><br><h4>  Command set </h4><br>  In the table below, <i>a</i> denotes a cell, which is determined by the address in digits <i>0-11</i> of the command code, <i>b</i> is a cell, which is determined by the address in digits <i>12-23</i> of the command code, <i>c</i> is defined by the address in digits <i>24-35</i> of the command code. <br><br>  Table with commands <br><table><tbody><tr><td>  <b>Operation code</b> </td><td>  <b>Team Name</b> </td><td>  <b>The installation condition sign w</b> </td><td>  <b>Machine actions for this command</b> </td></tr><tr><td>  01 </td><td>  Addition </td><td>  c &lt;0 </td><td>  Algebraic addition of numbers <i>a</i> and <i>b</i> occurs, the sum is normalized and placed in cell <i>c</i> </td></tr><tr><td>  03 </td><td>  Subtraction </td><td>  c &lt;0 </td><td>  From <i>a is</i> taken away <i>b</i> </td></tr><tr><td>  05 </td><td>  Multiplication </td><td>  | c |  &gt; = 1 </td><td>  Numbers <i>a</i> and <i>b</i> multiply </td></tr><tr><td>  04 </td><td>  Subtraction modules </td><td>  c &lt;0 </td><td>  From the absolute value of <i>a, the</i> absolute value of <i>b is</i> subtracted. </td></tr><tr><td>  06 </td><td>  Order addition </td><td>  P ¬©&gt; = 1 </td><td>  Cell number <i>c is</i> written with the mantissa <i>a</i> and an order equal to the sum of the orders of the numbers <i>a</i> and <i>b</i> </td></tr><tr><td>  07 </td><td>  Order subtraction </td><td>  P ¬©&gt; = 1 </td><td>  Cell number is written in <i>c</i> with the mantissa of the number <i>a</i> and an order equal to the difference of orders of numbers <i>a</i> and <i>b</i> </td></tr><tr><td>  ten </td><td>  Transfer number with the assignment of the sign of another number </td><td>  P ¬©&gt; = 1 </td><td>  1 In cell <i>c is</i> written a number that has an absolute value of <i>a</i> and the sign of the number <i>b</i> </td></tr><tr><td>  12 </td><td>  Addition of numbers without rounding </td><td>  c = 0 </td><td>  The numbers <i>a</i> and <i>b are</i> algebraically added. </td></tr><tr><td>  eleven </td><td>  Part selection </td><td>  c = 0 </td><td>  Operation ‚ÄúLogical AND‚Äù is performed between cells <i>a</i> and <i>b</i> </td></tr><tr><td>  13 </td><td>  Formation </td><td>  c = 0 </td><td>  Operation ‚ÄúLogical OR‚Äù is performed between cells <i>a</i> and <i>b</i> </td></tr><tr><td>  sixteen </td><td>  Comparison </td><td>  c!

The Strela computer was installed in seven key organizations of the Soviet Union.  Namely: the Department of Applied Mathematics of the Steklov Mathematical Institute (OPM MIAN USSR), Computing Center No. 1 of the Ministry of Defense of the USSR (EC No. 1 of the USSR Ministry of Defense - military unit 01168), Research Institute Almaz (Research Institute Almaz), The Computing Center of the USSR Academy of Sciences (EC of the USSR), the Computing Research Center of the Moscow State University named after MV Lomonosov (NIVTs MSU), the Arzamas-16 Nuclear Center and the Chelyabinsk-70 Nuclear Center.  Machines used for nuclear space calculations and the solution of certain military tasks of national importance. <br><br>  The first copy of the computer "Strela" was installed in the OPM Steklov Mathematical Institute of the USSR (1953) - the basic Soviet institute for conducting nuclear-space calculations.  In the mid-50s, Mstislav V. Keldysh, a Soviet scientist in the field of applied mathematics and mechanics, who heads the institute, together with the programming department, was engaged in calculating the trajectories of artificial earth satellites.  The programs were supposed to provide round-the-clock processing of measurements of the trajectories of the satellite.  They were also used in the calculations of the flight of Yuri Alekseevich Gagarin.  Also on the computer "Strela" were carried out aerodynamic calculations of the Soviet passenger jet Tu-104. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/9fc/9e6/4b5/9fc9e64b507b4e63b2ca0008940aff6d.jpg"><br><br>  <i>At the computer control panel Strela</i> <br><br>  One of the most important places for the installation of the Strely computer was the computer center No. 1 of the USSR Ministry of Defense, since the tasks of state importance were solved there.  In 1950  the orbits of the first artificial earth satellites and interplanetary space stations were calculated by car.  The programmers and mathematicians solved various information retrieval tasks for the main departments and divisions of the USSR Ministry of Defense (Main Artillery Directorate, General Staff, Main Intelligence Directorate, Logistics Directorate, Land Force Directorate, etc.). <br><br>  The seventh copy of the computer "Strela entered the Nuclear Center" Chelyabinsk-70 "- the second center of the USSR for the development of nuclear weapons.  A strong team of theoretical physicists, computer specialists and scientists in the field of mathematical modeling worked in the center. <br><br>  The creators of the computer "Strela" in 1954 received state awards of I, II and III degrees.  Yu.Y.  Bazilevsky was awarded the title Hero of Socialist Labor. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/371785/">https://habr.com/ru/post/371785/</a></p>
