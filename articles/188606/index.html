      Since the publication of the <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/rusonyx/blog/186888/">previous post</a> two weeks have passed.  During this time, so much has happened that I can not believe it.  It can not be that all this is happening to us right now! <br><br>  In short, the distribution of the mega-servers of SKB Kontur was successfully completed (and we even have a photo!), Our communities on <a href="http://vk.com/orangeman.russia">VKontakte</a> and <a href="http://www.facebook.com/Orangeman.Russia">Facebook</a> started working at full capacity, the team distribution of equipment from Enthusiasts ended with a capital letter, the <a href="http://orangeman.rusonyx.ru/">website of the initiative</a> appeared, about our ideas wrote a variety of media, and today, with the support of the company Lol from Khabarovsk, we are launching the next distribution of servers! <br><br>  Interesting?  Read on :) <br><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br><h4>  From many to many. </h4><br> <a href="http://orangeman.rusonyx.ru/"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/08d/960/847/08d960847bd08c415b883c5a027956d6.png" alt="image"></a> <br>  The first distribution of servers was a single action in the format <b>from one to many</b> , when Rusonix gave servers to other people and organizations.  Naturally, we simply would not have the resources to do it constantly on our own behalf.  And the moment of turning Orange Guy into Orangeman was very frightening and difficult for us. <br><br>  It was clear that we definitely need to go into the format <b>from many to many</b> , when completely different people and companies distribute equipment to other people.  If this is not done, the initiative will die.  It is too early to draw conclusions, but there is a feeling that with your help we succeeded!  :) <br><br>  First we were joined by SKB Kontur from Yekaterinburg with servers of incredible size and power.  Then among the many people who wrote to us, there were four brave ones.  These people, the real Orangemen, decided to give their own old equipment.  And today we will have a new distribution from the company Lol from Khabarovsk. <br><br>  We move on and hope that other companies and enthusiasts will join us to continue the distribution.  As they say, keep the ball rolling.  We can not stop. <br><br>  Share Orangeman ideas with friends and acquaintances!  Direct contacts with people responsible for iron in various companies will be very useful to us! <br><br><h4>  Results distribution servers SKB Kontur. </h4><br> <a href="http://kontur.ru/"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/e20/2ff/219/e202ff21915ac7de5ed1f6edc74f7468.png" alt="image"></a> <br><br>  <a href="http://kontur.ru/">SKB Kontur has</a> been a federal software developer since 1988.  The company employs more than 2,000 professionals who are able to find practical solutions to the most complex tasks. <br><br>  The company's head office is located in Yekaterinburg, and the servers that the guys from Kontur decided to distribute were located in the Moscow data center. <br><br>  We accepted applications for receiving servers on the following pages in the communities: <a href="http://vk.com/wall-55800696_5">post in VK</a> , <a href="http://www.facebook.com/photo.php%3Ffbid%3D502851369785491%26set%3Da.502850706452224.1073741827.502840016453293%26type%3D1">post in FB</a> . <br><br>  As a result of the selection of applications, new owners of glands were identified: <br><br>  <b>1. RCTU them.</b>  <b>Mendeleev</b> <br>  Blade chassis: HP BladeSystem c7000 Enclosure (16 x ProLiant BL460 Server with Xeon E5345 QuadlCore) <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/112/989/570/112989570de62f1cc20bd00bd807cc64.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Many people ask: ‚ÄúWhat are the criteria for deciding on the transfer of equipment?‚Äù The answer is simple: the recipient is chosen by the one who gives.  To whom, if not the master of iron, is it better to know why it can be used? <br><br>  And here is the opinion of SKB Kontur specialists: <br><br>  Pavel Zimarev, head of server support: ‚Äú <i>The choice of winners was due to several factors:‚Äú Firstly, the project should be socially useful. Therefore, the application of the Mendeleev Russian Chemical Engineering University was chosen. Secondly, SKB Kontur has been helping universities for a long time, for example sponsoring programming championships. Transferring a blade server is another way to show that research work in universities is an important and useful thing. And of course, the server must do work that is adequate to its power, and complex</i>  <i>mathematical calculations are just what you need</i> . ‚Äù <br><br>  The Russian University of Chemical Technology needed an increase in computing power.  At the university, experiments are being conducted on the modeling of chemical processes and the preparation of aerogels. <br><br>  <b>2. Cadastral Chamber of the Moscow Region</b> <br>  HP rx8640 server, 16core HP Bundle Montecito 1.6GHz / 18MB (Itanium), 128GB RAM <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/e0a/cf7/952/e0acf79527e38160672e380a423ee76c.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  As for the server on Itanium processors, then it was easier to choose.  ‚Äú <i>This is a special server in terms of architecture and dimensions.</i>  <i>The new owner must understand how to handle it.</i>  <i>It is impossible not to encourage the desire of the Cadastral Chamber of the Moscow Region to have a backup server</i> . ‚Äù <br><br><h4>  Team distribution of equipment from enthusiasts </h4><br>  We have received many letters from people who want to give away their old iron.  Unfortunately, not all of them were able to send information and photos to our distribution team.  Of the dozens of letters left, four brave ones. <br><br>  Last Thursday, with the help of these enthusiasts, we conducted a team distribution of servers and computers.  Guys, thank you so much for taking this step!  This is a good example for all of us. <br><br>  <b>1. Vladimir Chernyuk from Kiev, Ukraine.</b>  Gave a computer. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/7dc/68b/637/7dc68b6377b685492a584340f61abdb6.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  <b>2.

We will be doing a big team distribution of equipment in mid-August and waiting for information about old computers and servers that you are ready to transfer to the right things.  <a href="">orangeman@rusonyx.ru</a> .  Thank! <br><br><h4>  NEW DISTRIBUTION </h4><br>  Our colleagues, great guys from Lol, decided to join the Orangeman initiative.
