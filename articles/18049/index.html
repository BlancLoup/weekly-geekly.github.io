  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Distribution of investments for your start-ups at BarCamp Baltics 2008</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"> <a href="http://barcamp.lv/">BarCamp Baltics 2008</a> is one of the <a href="http://barcamp.org/">barcamps</a> , non-conferencing, dedicated to various web-dance themes.  Inspired by the October <a href="http://blogcamp.com.ua/">2007 BlogCamp CIS and Baltics 2007</a> in Kiev, the Baltic BarCamp will be held in Riga on February 7-10, 2008. <br><br>  Innovation Incubator is one of the BarCamp Baltics features that gives you a chance to find investments for your startup. <br><br>  Money for projects with a budget of up to 1,500 euros and a period of up to one month will be available free of charge.  The <a href="http://ejc.nl/">European Journalism Center</a> from the Netherlands agreed to fund such projects.  Incidentally, they already held a <a href="http://www.bloggersconference.eu/doku.php">European (un) bloggers conference</a> in Amsterdam this fall.  Perhaps other organizations will join the EJC.

      If you are interested in more serious investments, the Innovation Incubator can act as a platform where you can start working with potential investors.  And only it will depend on you to what results the negotiations will lead.  So, the Latvian social network <a href="http://draugiem.lv/">draugiem.lv</a> showed interest in such investments.  It is also possible the emergence of new investors. <br><br>  You can submit your projects for participation in the incubator <a href="http://network.barcamp.lv/forum/topic/listForCategory%3FcategoryId%3D1555716%253ACategory%253A160">in the appropriate section of the social network of the Baltic BarCamp</a> .  In the same place, a pretty girl named Di @ logija will answer your questions (and not here in the comments!) <br><br>  Also, in order to get to BarCamp, you need to <a href="http://barcamp.lv/register/">register</a> .  Entrance to the event will be free, and parts of the participants will pay the fare. <br><br>  Under the cut - the official text of the Incubator. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  The Innovation Incubator at BarCamp Baltics will support the following 2 clusters in proposed projects: <br><br>  Financing and support for the Innovation Incubator at BarCamp Baltics will be organized in two classes: <br><br>  Class 1: Small-format (with a budget of 0-1500 euros) ideas aimed at creating new or developing existing projects of New Media.  Projects that fit the criteria for this group should be completed within a month after the Incubator and presented / collected on a special page on the BarCamp Baltics website - barcamp.lv.  Neither BarCamp Baltics (as an organization) nor sponsors take part in these projects, i.e.  applicants retain ownership of the project in full.  That is, they will be offered financing in the form of a grant, and not in the form of a loan or venture capital. <br><br>  Winners in this direction will be notified on the last day of BarCamp and will present their projects from the stage. <br><br>  Class 2: Large-scale (with a budget of more than 1,500 euros, without an upper limit) initiatives aimed at creating the next generation of start-ups (start-up) of New Media.  These projects, in general, will receive sufficient funding to start their own business (participation in this group is open to both commercial and non-commercial applicants). <br><br>  BarCamp Baltics (as an organization) will act as an intermediary between sponsors and participants presenting their ideas.  For the contestants will be organized trainings and assistance in the development and improvement of their ideas.  Funding can be in the form of seed capital, loans, and grants (the latter for non-commercial projects). <br><br>  The mechanism of distribution / selection of winners will be as follows: BarCamp Baltics, after consulting with a specially created expert jury, will select approximately 10-15 large-format projects that seem promising and viable.  Projects will be announced on the last day of BarCamp.  Selected applicants will need to provide a more detailed business plan for further evaluation. <br><br>  2-3 months after BarCamp, these participants will have to arrive in Riga for weekly training and further discussions with donors / sponsors (who may be venture capital investors; organizations giving loans for media development; traditional non-profit organizations sponsoring such projects, etc.).  BarCamp Baltics will select the best trainers / curators, most of whom have already successfully implemented Internet and media initiatives.  Curators will share stories of their own success and mistakes (such projects as Skype, Facebook, etc.) <br><br>  At the end of the week of training / mentoring, BarCamp Baltics will name the projects that will receive funding.  Negotiations on specific commercial details will take place in private between the applicant and the sponsor;  BarCamp Baltics does not participate in this part of the procedure.  Thus, if all 15 projects are of interest to sponsors, all of them will be able to get funding;  if donors don‚Äôt want to sponsor a single project, no one will receive funding. <br><br>  Scenarios / Examples: <br><br>  1. Description: Website X is a new citizen journalism website that publishes stories, photos, and videos made by ordinary citizens.  They can create a social network where their community can create user profiles, chat, share news, etc.  This means that they will need to hire a web developer for a period of 2 weeks and pay for the creation of a social network customized for users;  preliminary costs - 800 euros. <br><br>  Action Required: Cluster 1 Fits <br><br>  Comments: If the jury considers that site X is very interesting and useful for the general development of New Media in their country and that the social network will significantly increase efficiency, funding will be guaranteed. <br><br>  2. Description: Mr. X (individual) wants to translate a series of instructions on how to become the best blogger, podcasting specialist or New Media, etc., from English to your native language.  Mr. X can guarantee that the copyright will not be infringed (ie, Mr. X has either already asked for permission to translate, or instructions have been issued for free distribution).  According to his estimate, the total amount required for the transfer is 300 euros. <br><br>  Action Required: Cluster 1 Fits <br><br>  Comments: If such instructions do not exist or those chosen by Mr. X seem to be extremely important for the region (ie, there are no alternatives), funding will be guaranteed. <br><br>  3. Description: Mr. X and Mrs Y plan to set up a business that makes it easier to track your online transactions (i.e., something like an online accounting service).  They already have an idea how to make a business profitable, and when (they consider that it will take 6 months).  At this stage of the project, they would like to receive financing in order to hire 3 developers and a sales manager for this term;  they need funds to pay wages for the first 6 months.  They think that they need 2,500 euros for such expenses. <br><br>  Action Required: Cluster 2 Fits <br><br>  Comments: If one (or several) sponsors working with BarCamp Baltics find this idea interesting, then they will negotiate and discuss specific commercial details t√™te-√†-t√™te with Mr. X and Mrs Y during the week of training. <br><br>  4. Description: Mr X and Mrs Y and Mrs Z want to build a new blog service that would be used by bloggers in their country.  They all like to use Technorati, and it seems to them that such a system should exist in their language version.  They do not yet have a completely clear business model, but it seems to them that such a service would be extremely popular among their country's bloggers.  According to their estimates, they need financing in the amount of 5,000 euros (payment for servers, development, and wages to them). <br><br>  Action Required: Cluster 2 Fits <br><br>  Comments: If one (or several) sponsors working with BarCamp Baltics find this idea interesting, then they will negotiate and discuss specific commercial details one-on-one with Mr. X and Mrs Y and Mrs Z during the week of training.  This particular idea / idea may be more interesting to non-commercial sponsors, such as foundations that care for universal moral effect, rather than commercial sustainability (such sponsors will also be presented at the conference). <br><br>  5. Description: Mr X and Ms Y would like to organize a series of trainings explaining how New Media and blogging could be useful for NGO workers in their region / country.  To implement this idea, you need about 3,000 euros, which includes transportation costs, rent, promotions in the amount of 10 trainings.  trainings are not included in the "costs". <br><br>  Action Required: Cluster 2 Fits <br><br>  Comments: And although in this case it is not necessary to form an organization to conduct 10 trainings, it is still possible to receive funding from a non-profit organization or even commercial sponsors cooperating with BarCamp Baltics.  Thus, Mr X and Ms Y will have to apply for participation in the cluster that is most suitable (Cluster 1, if the required amount of funding is less than 1,500 euros; Cluster 2, if more is needed).  BarCamp Baltics (as an organization) will make every effort to help find a suitable sponsor. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/18049/">https://habr.com/ru/post/18049/</a></p>
