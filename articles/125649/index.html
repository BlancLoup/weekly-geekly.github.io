  <section class="page js-page"><h1>E-Humanities: projects and initiatives</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Most publications on the problems of informatization and computerization of scientific research are devoted to the natural and technical sciences.  The problems of informatization of the humanities are given much less attention: they almost do not deal with quantitative data, and therefore the possibility of using computer technology in the research process, compared with natural science, looks very, very limited.  However, if we analyze the issue in more detail, it turns out that the informatization of humanitarian research is a very interesting and promising matter.  The introduction of computer technology will help bring conceptual bridges between the humanities and technical sciences, and give many traditional questions a new understanding.  In the English-speaking world, the term eHumanities has come into use, denoting a set of initiatives and projects in the field of informatization of the sciences of culture and society. <br>  The study of the problems of informatization of the sciences of culture and society in the modern world is carried out very, very actively.  In this post I would like to provide an overview of the most interesting web projects in this area.  When selecting resources for a review, I was guided primarily by the criteria of interdisciplinarity and multiplicity.  First of all, I tried to consider projects focused on a wide range of topics and of potential interest to scientists of various specializations.  The main subject of study in the humanities is the text;  Many of the specialized resources are text collections with various additional functions.  Text archives and libraries were left out of consideration;  I tried to select resources that are collections of data that can be checked, corrected and used in the work of other scientists. <br>  Naturally, this review is by no means exhaustive.  I would be grateful for comments and additions. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  <b><a href="http://www.clarin.eu/">CLARIN</a></b>

      CLARIN (Common Language Resources and Technology Infrastructure) is a large-scale project funded by the European Union with the goal of building a collection of interconnected data in all languages ‚Äã‚Äãof the world, equipped with semantic search tools.  Work on the project is not finished yet;  Many features are only available in test mode.  Of the functions available, firstly, the virtual linguistic atlas of the world is of particular interest, and secondly, the summary catalog of linguistic resources with the ability to search by languages, countries, continents, etc. The catalog includes not only textual, but also multimedia resources. . <br>  Catalogs are still in the process of being filled, but with their help you can already find very interesting materials: for example, audio recordings of speech of speakers of rare African languages.  It is assumed that registered project participants will also upload their own materials to the site and add new entries to the catalog. <br><br>  <b><a href="http://textgrid.de/">TextGrid</a></b> <br><br>  German project, whose goal is informatization and automation of working with text.  Initially, this service was aimed at philologists, and its goal was to create opportunities for editing, annotating, analyzing and publishing special texts.  Today, the target audience of the project has significantly expanded: historians, musicologists, art historians and specialists in other humanities are invited to cooperate.  As a goal of this project, the creation of a collection of both text and multimedia materials, organized as a grid system, is now being considered.  Large German universities and libraries have already joined the project. <br>  The final launch of the project is planned in 2012. <br><br>  <b><a href="http://textvre.cerch.kcl.ac.uk/">TextVRE</a></b> <br><br>  The British project, the creators of which are largely guided by TextGrid.  Is under development.  Currently, the site is more informational;  The full functional version of the project will be downloaded later.  The goal of the project is to present materials from a number of UK archives in the form of a system of related data and to provide researchers with the possibility of semantic search for documents. <br><br>  <b><a href="http://www.rechercheisidore.fr/">Isidore</a></b> <br><br>  The French project, which is a huge database with advanced search capabilities (by country, by language, by category, topics, etc.).  Many materials are available for free download in pdf format.  The site contains a rich collection of materials on history, sociology, philosophy, linguistics, literary studies, political sciences, etc. Libraries, universities, research groups have the opportunity to add their own materials to catalogs and upload to the site. <br><br>  <b><a href="http://www.projectbamboo.org/">Project BAMBOO</a></b> <br><br>  A large international project, the developers of which rely on interdisciplinarity, on the joint work of humanities with specialists in the field of computer technology.  The project has a dual purpose.  First, it is supposed to create virtual research communities (i.e., scientific social networks with advanced features).  Secondly, the project participants are planning to provide software for automating humanitarian studies.  There are some very interesting developments: for example, the Woodchipper textual analysis tool. <br>  While the project functions only in the test version;  full featured version will be launched in 2012. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/125649/">https://habr.com/ru/post/125649/</a></p>
