Nevertheless, I want to talk about those features that have not yet been voiced and tell why the new "Nexus" turned out the way it is. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/7d2/110/692/7d21106923abb5425c739fb9cc891403.jpg"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h3>  Design </h3><br>  The appearance of the device is, first of all, the way buyers and users will remember it, after all, they need to communicate with the device every day, which means that the design should be not only pleasant, but also convenient. <br>  We tried to preserve the continuity in the forms and outlines, to make it look like the previous ‚ÄúGoogle Phone‚Äù, but not to copy completely and rethink those moments that seemed controversial. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/b9e/3d7/de1/b9e3d7de19be054eec3d7631dcde811c.jpg" alt="image">

      Since the time of the Galaxy Nexus, technology has managed to step forward, the new smartphone is equipped with much more modern hardware, screen and wireless technologies, and nothing emphasizes high-tech stuffing as well as the noble and high-quality materials of the case.  Corning Gorilla Glass 2, the most high-quality plastic, resistant to friction, shock and scratches, textured back panel, neat and strict appearance.  In other words, the Nexus 4 has all the qualities to be called the flagship Google device for 2012-2013 - and the stuffing and materials at the height. <br><br><h3>  Camera </h3><br>  The device is equipped with a new camera, which implements the entire set of technologies relevant for 2012: shooting speed, image stabilization, video shooting in 1080p format and high-quality optics. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/959/a62/640/959a62640508f0c53037f9f3667bfbe3.jpg"><br><br>  Sensor resolution is 8 MP (more than enough for a smartphone), the sensor itself is based on BSI technology, and its power consumption is approximately halved when compared with last year.  The camera software has also been updated, now it is able to shoot spherical panoramas with automatic gluing, and the Auto Upload function (Instant upload) allows you to save frames not only in the smartphone‚Äôs memory (what else can happen to it), but also in the Google + social network. <br><br><h3>  Iron </h3><br>  Speaking of stuffing.  Unfortunately, (or fortunately) the performance characteristics became known to the community long before the official announcement, so the list of characteristics will not surprise anyone.  But to explain why this or that ‚Äúiron‚Äù is chosen is please. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/148/d81/00e/148d8100e6046512e38239dfb3290802.jpg"><br><br>  SoC Qualcomm Snapdragon S4 is selected as one of the most powerful systems at the moment, 4 cores built on the Krait architecture in conjunction with the most powerful Adreno 320 give the smartphone a large supply of computing power, and therefore updates will be released for it longer, since the stuffing will be enough relevant after a year and a half.  Well, two gigabytes of RAM is a nice bonus, there is not much RAM.  ;) <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/986/a07/0ac/986a070ac4d03d71197cd0036914d339.jpg"><br><br>  You will not surprise anyone with wireless technologies, but nevertheless it would be wrong to refuse wireless charging and some innovations in its part.  The charger and the power transmission module are made according to the Qi standard (chi is readable), which is used by a number of other giants of the mobile industry.  Actually the Nexus Charger looks like this.  Just put the phone on this thing and after a couple of hours it will be fully charged. <br><br><img src="http://www.habrastorage.com/images/5hzh.png" alt="image"><br><br>  The new screen is made using ZeroGap Touch technology - there is no layer of air between the protective glass Corning Gorilla Glass 2 and the matrix itself, the image literally touches your fingers - without parallax and unnecessary reflections in the bright sun. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/237/7d5/1b3/2377d51b3322d4f257c5894e3b3c31e5.jpg"><br><br>  Resolution - 1280x768, diagonal - 4.7 inches, matrix - True HD IPS with excellent indicators of viewing angles, color reproduction and power consumption.  Currently it is one of the best screens on the smartphone market. <br><br><h3>  Memory </h3><br>  And now about the amount of memory.  The device was developed with an eye to the main markets of Google - the United States and Europe, which have long been dominated by excellent coverage of mobile networks, high-quality mobile Internet and cloud services.  For this reason, the device has 16 GB of memory installed (the 8 GB version will not be delivered to Russia) and there is no slot for expanding memory cards.  For the second indirectly, you can say thanks to the monolithic case with a non-removable battery. <br><br><h3>  Software </h3><br>  On the features of the software is better to read a separate <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/156623/">topic</a> on Android 4.2, since everything is already described in detail. <br><br><h3>  When to expect? </h3><br>  In Russia and the CIS countries, the smartphone will go on sale in late November / early December.  And we promise that the price will not disappoint you. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/157039/">https://habr.com/ru/post/157039/</a></p>
