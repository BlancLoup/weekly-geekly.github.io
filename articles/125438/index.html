  <section class="page js-page"><h1>5 habits of successful people</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  <i><a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/gtd/125167/">My first translation</a> was warmly welcomed by hacksmiths, so I continue to translate the articles I liked.</i> <br><br>  Successful people and winners fascinate me.  I always wonder what makes them stand out from other people.  Therefore, reading books about successful people, I try to highlight the "winning" habits that they have.  Here are five of them that I noticed. <a name="habracut"></a><br><br><h4>  They know where they are going. </h4><br>  You feel confused when you do not know the direction in which to move forward.  People who have achieved great success always know what awaits them at the end.  They know what they want and force themselves to achieve it, <br>  When you have a goal, you have something that you can focus on.  If you have no goal, you will wander and feel confused.  The ultimate goal always helps to move in the right direction.

    <h4>  Need to find the cause </h4><br>  The ultimate goal is only part of the story.  Winners have a reason to achieve their goals.  They know what motivates them to achieve their goals. <br>  The path to the goal is full of obstacles.  Many people quit halfway because they have no reason.  But those who have good reasons for achieving their goals have great chances to pass all the tests. <br>  The chance of giving up if you have no reason is much higher.  If you want to lose weight by 9 kilograms, but you do not see the reasons for this, you will find it too difficult to achieve this goal.  If you want to lose 9 kilograms to look better at your wedding, the probability of achieving this goal will be much higher. <br>  When there is a reason, the chances of achieving will always be higher. <br><br><h4>  Need to find a support group </h4><br>  On the way to the goal it is very easy to surrender if you are alone.  Form a support group for yourself or find a mastermind - this will help you to go further.  To form a support group, find like-minded people with similar desires and goals.  This should be a group of two to six people.  Choose people carefully, preferably positive and with similar goals. <br>  If you do not know where to look, try thematic forums related to what you do (fitness, personal development, etc.). <br><br><h4>  They know exactly how they spend their time. </h4><br>  If you don‚Äôt know how you spend your time, you‚Äôll probably waste most of that time.  You can spend your money and earn it again, but if you spend time, you will not get it back. <br>  You should be aware of how you spend your time.  If you want to achieve your goal, but you spend 70 percent of your time watching TV or hanging out with friends, you will most likely fail. <br>  Get a temporary log.  There are many web-based and mobile applications that can help you keep track of what you were doing at the computer and how much time you spent on each of the sites. <br>  Use the log to get a clear picture of how you spend your time and make the appropriate adjustments.  If you seriously decided to change your life and achieve your goal, spend more time on more necessary activities than ‚Äútimers‚Äù. <br><br><h4>  Try fast, fail fast, try again and never give up </h4><br>  It is very difficult to reach the goal from the first time.  Therefore, the winners try quickly, fail quickly, keep trying, and never give up.  There are many things that you do not know how to do, and trial and error is one way to learn this. <br>  You can learn faster by trying and failing several times in as little time as possible.  You learn at a slow pace when you are too slow to act.  When you act faster, you learn faster and understand which things work and which ones are useless. <br>  You can make the necessary adjustments in the course, to do everything right and get closer to your goal.  If you are slow in action, you jeopardize the whole process of achieving the goal and hinder your progress. <br>  You may experience many disappointments during your learning process.  Anyway, don't give up.  Keep trying new ideas.  Keep doing what works, and do not waste time on uselessness. <br>  Find a coach or mentor.  Regardless of whether you want to lose weight or start a business, a mentor will help you achieve your goal faster.  Since they have already reached their goal, they are aware of the challenges you will face and whether this idea will work or not.  Borrow their experience and you will reach your goal faster. <br><br>  If you decide to change your life, I challenge you right now.  Start planning and setting goals.  Make this year the best year of your life.  Do you accept the challenge? </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/125438/">https://habr.com/ru/post/125438/</a></p>
