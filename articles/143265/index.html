In general, in the distant past, there was a kind of supercivilization, the level of development of which on the basis of the Internet, technology and biology allowed to unite people into a single information network without requiring any additional interfaces.  A certain reconfiguration of the biological structure of the brain, and eventually included in the DNA and inherited, Like the current Wi-Fi, but the receiver and transmitter are built on synapses and axons.  Each owner of such an improvement has the possibility of continuous communication with the network repeaters, using their information and other capabilities. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  The purpose of the network is the same as now - garbage.  Those.  the satisfaction of all the needs of the population, but in contrast to the current, purely informational satisfaction, what is now called electronic commerce has gradually developed, but in an expanded sense.  Those.  not only ordered through the network, (brought - use), but also, for example, the correction of an existing state.  Well, sort of called a repairman.  Or a setup man.  The means of execution and delivery is of course also at the same technically developed level worthy of super-civilization. <br>  It is clear that with such a network structure, money in any form cannot be a means of payment.  Different planets, different star systems, different political devices and scales of values.  In addition, the brain does not store webmoney, it has a different purpose.  The payment was somewhat modified and moved from money to what the individual can provide for the development and maintenance of the network as a whole.  Networks need - energy to maintain performance, information and, quite remarkable, new users of the network.  Those.  giving the system something from this list, I can use it. <br>  What does a telekinetic do when moving a ping-pong ball from place to place?  He strenuously searches for certain sensations, then connects them with desire and by spending these sensations, oversees the realization.  Nothing like? <br>  And telepathy?  We evoke a sense of connection (each has his own personal - of course - login password), create the image of the subscriber (avatar, so to speak), press a button in the brain causing a certain sensation and voila.  Messenger to our services.  Of course there are many pitfalls.  Remember how the Buddha spoke - the right effort, the right thoughts, the right goal.  How to create an avatar, how to enter a login / password - all this is necessary to learn.  Here we need the right actions. <br>  Let's go further.  Some people have these abilities more, others less, but everyone has them.  This is the basics.  Those who have more - can further develop them, by transferring to other people.  To teach others in one word.  Nothing like? <br>  Of course, there are failures.  For example, I want to find a certain thing.  I'm starting to google.  And Google gives out anything, except for the desired position of the lost thing.  Well, there is no this information in it.  Not indexed yet, but he cannot admit it.  Not programmed.  So all sorts of psychics suffer, which have proved themselves well in other cases.  How to make a thing well-found?  Even before the loss, put it on the search engine, wait for indexing, and then lose.  And find.  Psychics will understand. <br>  Even further.  Congenital abilities, let's call them for simplicity - karma, do not allow everyone to get to the source, but only those who manage to find the interface, enable the mechanism of communication with the network.  With information and students it is understandable, but how to transfer the network energy?  What do I personally have that may need this network?  Actually, it is very simple - I can transfer only the ability to realize desires to the network.  The energy of this ability.  Where can I get it, because I cannot realize my wishes, am I a simple homo?  I can not - can the network.  What is this energy?  Attention - the magic!  What do we do when we consciously refuse to fulfill any whim in favor of something more valuable?  Where does the energy of our solution disappear?  After all, it is so easy to solve, and what are the consequences?  Here it is - the right actions, the right intentions ... Great people sometimes give birth to the world! <br>  It turns out that it is necessary to save the refusals of the realization of desires and at the time of the network order itself - to pay with the previous own torments.  Speaking primitively, I took a vow - not to eat sweet for two months - I fulfilled it - now I can exchange the energy of ‚Äústability‚Äù accumulated during this time from the network, having received something desired.  Pleasure gives the network, and you have to pay with pain.  And it works ... <br>  Well, and more.  Understandably, after the dying of the physical media, the network puts its image in the archive.  Do not lose in vain his energy.  But one cannot take it away - either the basic principle of private property is violated (I personally do not really believe in such humaneness), or, most likely, energy is too much attached to a person and cannot be used by someone else.  Losing a potential payer is wasteful. <br>  Of course, he exists there in a somewhat reduced form in the costs and acquisitions, but there is.  Waiting for activation.  The same network activates it when the most suitable place to pay is for it (doesn‚Äôt it resemble anything?) And continues to develop its ability to pay and earn - that is,  save energy for payment.  Type - heaven and hell. <br>  What is the meaning of our life?  Well, it‚Äôs clear what to do - actively press the keys, call different sites, be a member of different forums, download torrents, collect ratings ... Being online in one word. <br>  A beautiful word is samsara. <br>  In general, the ancient civilization was devoured, disintegrated, the payment system partially collapsed, but the network built on this principle exists while the communication gene is alive.  The network still collects users, delivers goods, indexes information. <br>  Of course, there are limitations - the availability of routers, the width of the channel, the number of DHCP subscribers - everything is as usual.  The phase of the moon, for example, determines the visibility of the router.  Or proxy.  Place and time of birth - the current IP address.  Dynamic.  A static address is acquired by subscribers who have the status of a router / proxy and are on continuous communication with the sky ... sorry, network.  Re-registration in the network - yes ... <br>  In general - it is clear.  Then everything will go in a well-developed technical style. <br>  How to use?  Search for clavus, mouse.  Press on different buttons, make a log, so as not to miss what the system responded to for a specific action.  There are no textbooks anymore.  We are hackers.  Everything. <br>  By the way, it is clear why some children with unusual abilities have recently become more frequent.  They understand the Internet in their own way. <br>  Well, and materialism?  Yes, nothing to do with it.  In general, all this has nothing to do with it.  Thanks to John Keats for the idea, and the rest is, by the way. </div>
