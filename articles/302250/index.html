    <h1>  SPB .NET Community </h1><br>  So, on June 2, the SPB .NET Community meeting will take place in the conference room of the Park Inn by Pulisson Pulkovskaya hotel, we will have speakers of the DotNext conference: <b>Sasha Goldstein</b> and <b>Sergey Schegrikovich</b> .  A week ago, I <a href="https://plus.google.com/%2BMikhailShcherbakov0/posts/XZRV5HV3FuY">published a</a> survey with a selection of topics from those offered by Sasha.  Most voted in favor <b>of .NET Garbage Collection Performance Tips</b> , let it be an example of democracy in action.  All those who are interested in issues of the internal structure of the GC, look for bottlenecks in working with managed memory, ways to minimize memory traffic and other subtle points are waiting for Sasha Goldstein to speak.  In the meantime, I recommend watching his report, which is recognized as the best in the past DotNext. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/ROC7dojVM7M%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=25657,15700023,15700043,15700186,15700191,15700248,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhitrd5kTptuFzRHrqVWxAZkLzzBgA" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  And <b>Sergey Shchegrikovich</b> will open the meeting <b>with the</b> report <b>"CoreCLR: Brave new world"</b> .  The report will share its experience of studying and working with CoreCLR, will consider in detail the process of debugging for CoreCLR, SOS and Finalizer.  Sergey arrives at the conference from Minsk and agreed to come to us with new material.  So our meetings have already acquired an international character. <br><br>  <b>Participation in the mitap is free, the number of places is limited.</b>  <b><a href="https://spbdotnet.timepad.ru/event/336766/">Sign up!</a></b> <br><br><h1>  DotNext </h1><br>  The next morning, the most hardcore .NET conference in Russia, <a href="http://dotnext.ru/spb/">DotNext,</a> will begin in this hall.  More than 20 reports, 3 streams, hundreds of hours of work of the organizers, the program committee and the main speakers!  The quintessence of experience, knowledge and effort.  I am writing about this since I saw the internal kitchen and took part in the preparation of this event.  I am pleased with what happened, for example, with a really strong program. <br><br>  Among the speakers of the DotNext conference there are guys who made their first reports at our meetings.  One of the goals from the first meetings was to get onto the stage and help everyone prepare to make presentations.  Many really cool developers do not talk about their experiences and projects simply because it is not clear where to start.  And in this situation, in my opinion, everyone loses.  The community does not share the unique experience about which not to read in the books, and the guys do not see new horizons of development.  Communication and discussion of their ideas often gives impetus in the most unexpected direction.  And public speaking is a separate sort of drug, still legal.  After the performance, you are showered with such a wave of endorphins that you can not stop. <br><br><h1>  Win win game </h1><br>  Starting from DotNext's past, the SPB .NET Community speakers are selected into the program and make excellent presentations.  This time it is Igor Labutin, Roman Nevolin, Vladimir Koshelev. <br><br>  <b>Igor Labutin</b> will speak on the topic <b>‚ÄúDiagnose WCF‚Äù</b> , this is a continuation of his report from the 10th meeting of the SPB .NET Community.  This time, Igor will talk about the methods of finding and diagnosing problems in WCF applications, from obvious to very hardcore ones.  If your life is a bloody enterprise and WCF is a working tool for you, and not ‚Äúoh, throw it away and rewrite everything to REST / WebAPI / HipstoServices‚Äù, then this report is for you.  And watch the video ‚ÄúWCF: Convenient or problem?‚Äù, There are also many useful things. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/_6MQ_TfrjBA%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=25657,15700023,15700043,15700186,15700191,15700248,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhgl0uVZEJkGCyPmrlDI88LPByOIUw" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  <b>Roman Nevolin</b> will speak on the topic <b>‚ÄúAnd again about machine learning on the .NET platform‚Äù</b> .  This is a continuation of the report about the potential and capabilities of machine learning on the .NET platform.  This time with an emphasis on bright demos, demonstrating the capabilities of .NET and Machine Learning.  And, of course, how to be without performance and benchmarks.  The first version of the report of the novel: <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/rmkbb2MutOo%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=25657,15700023,15700043,15700186,15700191,15700248,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhi78Tjw3gLtEDekVRByixwzMkIPSA" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  <b>Vladimir Koshelev "Not all static analyzers are equally useful</b> . <b>"</b>  The first part of the report will discuss popular tools that look for violations of Guidelines, copy-paste errors and typos in the source code.  The second part is about more complex errors, such as the occurrence of a NullReferenceException or resource leaks, and how to detect them.  Both purely static analysis, for example, Coverity Prevent, and static-dynamic, such as IntelliTest (Pex), can help detect such errors.  The conversation will focus on the similarities and differences of these analyzes and why they do not interchange, but complement each other, as well as about their use in production.  On our mitap, Vladimir read a review report on static analysis methods of .NET applications.  After which we held a round table with experts from ISP RAS, JetBrains, Positive Technologies on the practice of using static analyzers and problems in their development.  Unfortunately, the video of the round table has not been preserved (another reason to attend meetings in person)), and the video of Vladimir‚Äôs report is available. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/6qu1k6xF3TI%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=25657,15700023,15700043,15700186,15700191,15700248,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhiJkpPNNXdR848eVa6-6NnaKTX3Mw" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  The program DotNext will be a lot of experienced speakers, who also spoke at our meetings, this is <b>Dmitry Nesteruk, Sergey Shkredov, Andrey Akinshin, Dmitry Ivanov</b> .  The entire program can be viewed <a href="http://dotnext.ru/spb/">on the DotNext website</a> . <br><br>  We are always looking for interesting reports and new speakers.
