  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Funnely: Facebook advertising automation for online stores</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Most recently, a new startup has emerged to automate the creation of advertising campaigns for Facebook social networks stores - Funnely.  At first glance, it may seem that the time for this is chosen poorly, since in the same Facebook on February 17 of this year there were improvements that expand the capabilities of its advertising tools.  Is it so? <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  Facebook's advertising tools were <a href="https://www.facebook.com/business/news/product-ads">really</a> improved: the ability to show several products in one ad was added, an automatic search appeared for users who are more suitable for certain products, the use of site statistics for targeting products, dynamic retargeting, automatic removal of a product removed from sales from an ad, and so on . <br><br>  But, as the creators of Funnely say, creating and setting up advertising campaigns on Facebook is a huge job that takes a lot of time.  In addition, they need to be constantly updated, monitor the budget, maintain the relevance of the content, and most importantly, set goals and analyze the results correctly. 
      <br>
        <script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>
        <ins class="adsbygoogle"
          style="display:block; text-align:center;"
          data-ad-layout="in-article"
          data-ad-format="fluid"
          data-ad-client="ca-pub-6974184241884155"
          data-ad-slot="8945601208"></ins>
        <script>
          (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
        </script>
      <br>
      For such work, the company will need a specially trained specialist, and maybe not one.  They will have to not only do the work mentioned above, but also periodically develop new advertising tools that Facebook creates. <br><br>  However, in this case <a href="http://www.nanigans.com/software/">Nanigans</a> , one of the leading companies in the field of social advertising automation, comes to the rescue.  The budgets of its advertising companies have repeatedly exceeded $ 500 million per year.  This is a very big player in the market for such services.  They really take on most of Facebook, budgeting and performance analysis, and achieve excellent results using their own innovative technologies. <br><br>  But a logical thought follows from this: not all companies can afford their services.  And not even because they are poor.  After all, it may simply be small firms that have a very modest turn.  And if they are small companies that don‚Äôt have not only that kind of money, but even there are no advertising specialists? <br><br>  And here Funnely <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2015/02/22/funnely-launch/">comes into</a> play.  So, Funnely helps small online stores that do not have the time, desire or qualifications to create and maintain Facebook advertising campaigns on their own. <br>  The startup was founded by people from Argentina, but the rest of the team is in Silicon Valley.  The project received $ 237,000 from a business incubator of 500 Startups, MITS Fund, NXTP Labs and business angels. <br><br>  One of the conditions for working with Funnely - the online store should be raised on the Shopify platform.  Funnely provides Shopify, Google Analytics and Facebook sync.  Thus, data on purchases and visitors of the store are analyzed with the help of Shopify, then advertising campaigns are generated on the basis of Facebook, goals are set in Google Analytics, indicators are monitored and results are analyzed. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/megamozg/post_images/27d/b70/ea0/27db70ea09543684c8e843dfb9ba637c.png" alt="image"><br><br>  So, working with the wine shop Invino, Funnely first divided users into categories.  Suppose you choose the category "lovers of red wine."  From the analysis of sales data obtained from the Shopify platform, the most popular products from the selected category were determined.  Facebook searched for users who have similar interests, who were also shown to advertise exactly red wine.  As a result, Invino, having invested $ 600 in a weekly advertising campaign, made a profit of $ 9,700, which is 16 times higher than the initial investment. <br><br>  Despite the fact that the beta version of Funnely came out about a week ago, the project has already earned $ 150,000 and increased the rate of return on investment (ROI) 17 times. <br><br>  Apparently, Funnely project will take a worthy place in its segment, successfully fitting in between Facebook and Nanigans. <br><br>  In the future, Funnely plans to expand and work not only with Facebook, but also with other social networks. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/286152/">https://habr.com/ru/post/286152/</a></p>
