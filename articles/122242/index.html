      We recently announced a <a href="http://www.napartner.ru/deals">report</a> on the first major successes of Napartner.  In its framework, we will talk about investments in startups that occurred through our fault;) <br><br>  So, the investment received: <a name="habracut"></a><br><ul><li>  <b>Vukraine</b> - real estate portal; </li><li>  <b>FlaShop</b> - SaaS service for online stores; </li><li>  <b>Follow my strategy</b> - service for traders; </li><li>  <b>Hosting Press</b> - a weblog about hosting; </li></ul>  Below is an interview with investors and project founders: their thoughts, advice and answers to the perennial question ‚Äúhow to find an investor‚Äù. <br><br><h2>  1. Project Vukraine / transaction amount: $ 500,000 </h2><br>  Internet resource ‚ÄúVukraine‚Äù is a single space for the exchange of information between the seller and the buyer, the lessor and the tenant of any real estate located in any of the settlements of Ukraine. <br><br>  From the <a href="http://www.napartner.ru/blogs/post/361">interview</a> : <br><br>  " <strong>Tell us about your deal. Why did the start-up project <a href="http://vukraine.com.ua/">VUkraine get</a> your attention?</strong> <br><img align="left" src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/1a38e345/d9a5d685/d243550e/40e7d30b.jpg"><br>  <em>- We are looking for fresh, original ideas that can benefit not only the owner, but also the community.</em>  <em>There are no analogues of ‚ÄúVUkraine‚Äù at the moment in the UAnet, in terms of functionality, social orientation and usability, although this is a rather highly competitive area of ‚Äã‚Äãweb resources on real estate.</em> <em><br><br></em>  <em>We clearly understand that the future is in Internet projects, we also understand that the future is not just the Internet sites offering goods to the buyer, but socially-oriented resources.</em>  <em>In addition, the market is interesting for which this project works.</em>  <em>The real estate market in our country is going through hard times due to the economic crisis, which simply collapsed it, but now we can note positive moments in this segment.</em>  <em>The undoubted argument in favor of this startup was the technical component of the portal, according to this indicator, VUkraine overtakes its closest pursuers by at least a year.</em>  <em>We count on the fact that our project will greatly benefit the Ukrainian real estate market and will help its growth.</em> <em><br><br></em>  <em>We are not going to make a real estate portal similar to the existing ones.</em>  <em>This will be the flagship portal, which will set new standards on the UAnet and help the Ukrainian Internet market take a step forward.</em>  " <br><br><h2>  2. FlaShop / transaction amount: $ 60,000 </h2><br>  From the <a href="http://www.napartner.ru/blogs/post/360">interview</a> : <br><br>  " <strong>Is this the first deal or are there other startups in your investment portfolio?</strong> <br><br>  <em>- Currently we have selected 3 projects on your resource.</em> <em><br><br></em>  <em>FlaShop - SaaS service for online stores.</em>  <em>There are no analogues in the network yet.</em>  <em>From June 15, the newly formed team in the new office will start working on the project.</em>  <em>As a result of the meeting in Moscow, in ‚ÄúCoffee House‚Äù with the author of one of the projects published by you, this idea was born unexpectedly for the parties.</em> <em><br><br></em>  <em>By the way, the project with which the author appeared on the pages of your site was cut down by us for 40 minutes.</em>  <em>The planned amount of investment - 60 000 dollars.</em>  <em>We expect that in six months and within this amount the project will pass the break-even point.</em>  <em>With this project, we are so confident of success that we are ready now to conduct preliminary negotiations with venture capital investors on the further development of a startup.</em>  " <br><br><h2>  3. Follow my strategy / transaction amount: $ 20,000 </h2><br>  Follow my strategy is a service for amateur traders and professionals.  Is at the stage of writing TK.  The author of the project - a high-level professional in the field of stock trading at the same time acts as a co-investor of the project.  Details of the transaction were not disclosed. <br><br><h2>  4. Hosting press / transaction amount: $ 25,000 </h2><br>  The idea of ‚Äã‚Äãcreating the project <a href="http://www.napartner.ru/deals/1">"hosting - press</a> " belongs to - <a href="http://www.napartner.ru/profile/3480/1">Alexey</a> . <br><br>  From the interview: <br><br>  " <strong>How long did it take you to search for an investor? How long did the negotiations last?</strong> <br><img align="left" src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/0a7d3bc3/e6a19ba6/1412ad1d/abd1e569.png"><br>  <em>Search investors did not take much time.</em>  <em>I registered on one, but very popular site napartner.ru, got a DOP account in order to stand out from the crowd of ordinary onlookers, and after two days I saw a good response, and as a result - an investment in the project!</em> <em><br><br></em>  <em>I studied many startup projects that were written by both experienced managers and novice startups.</em>  <em>In most of them I observed one, but very serious mistake.</em>  <em>The authors are trying to immediately show the investor the entire project, painting it down to the smallest details.</em>  <em>The result is a lot of unnecessary and useless information.</em>  <em>And this is not right.</em> <em><br><br></em>  <em>The main thing in a startup is a concept, that is an idea.</em>  <em>And it is on the idea that we get the investment.</em>  <em>The question of what color the wallpaper will be in the office is unlikely to interest the investor.</em>  <em>My advice is to write a business plan for a startup on one or two A4 pages.</em>  <em>The idea will be clear and easily accessible, and if it is of interest to the investor, then with closer contact you can provide him with additional information.</em>  " <br><br>  ***** <br><br>  We are glad that our work helps people and brings real results.  We will move in the same direction :) <br><br>  PS Anyone who wants to attract funding in their startup project, we invite you to do it right <a href="http://www.napartner.ru/registration">now</a> . <br><habracut></habracut></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/122242/">https://habr.com/ru/post/122242/</a></p>
