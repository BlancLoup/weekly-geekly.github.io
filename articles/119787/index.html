With its help, you can not only search for programs that were lost in a new, slightly inconvenient menu, but also use it as a command line.  In addition, with its help, you can quickly launch applications with administrator rights: just write the application name (or command) and press Ctrl-Shift-Enter.  In this case, you can not write the name completely - the application that is at the top of the list will be launched. <br>  In addition, you can quickly run as an administrator of the program, located in the taskbar (it does not matter whether they are fixed or not) or in the start menu.  To do this, press the Ctrl-Shift key when clicking on the program.  With desktop shortcuts, this trick no longer passes :-(

    <h3>  Electricity usage report </h3><br>  Undoubtedly a useful thing for laptop owners.  With this report you can find out which program or device consumes the battery the most.  To receive this report, you need to run the following command on the command line with administrator rights: <br> <code>powercfg -energy</code> <br>  In about a minute the analysis will end and they will tell you where this report can be viewed.  Alternatively, you can determine the location of the report: <br> <code>powercfg -energy -output C:\Temp\report.html</code> <br> <br><h3>  Search the Internet from the start menu </h3><br>  In addition to using the search bar, you can find programs, inspect the file system and execute commands, you can use it to search for information on the Internet.  Alas, by default it is hidden.  To show this menu item, you need to open the group policy editor (run gpedit.msc), go into the user configuration, administrative templates, start menu and taskbar.  At the top, we see the option "Add the link" Search in the Internet "in the" Start "menu.  Double-click on it, select ‚Äúturn on‚Äù and click ‚ÄúOK‚Äù.  After that, you can try to write something for an example in the search bar of the ‚Äústart‚Äù menu and see the ‚ÄúSearch in the Internet‚Äù item directly above it.  Who does not want to lose time moving the cursor to this button can press the up arrow and Enter. <br>  By the way, there are many more interesting settings in group policies, but most of them will interest only system administrators. <br>  However, those who work on versions of Windows 7 to Professional gpedit.msc Professional may not be.  Nevertheless, it is quite possible to add a search item.  It is necessary to change (or add with the DWORD type) one registry key: <br> <code>HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Policies\Microsoft\Windows\Explorer\AddSearchInternetLinkInStartMenu</code> <br>  To add an item, you need to set the value to 1, to delete - 0. Even faster, all this can be done with the help of ready-made reg-files: <a href="">add</a> , <a href="">delete</a> .  However, if you change this registry key, this menu item will appear only after the restart of Explorer. <br><br><h3>  Taskbar navigation </h3><br>  In addition to the well-known Alt-Tab and the new three-dimensional Win-Tab, there is another way to switch between running applications.  You can click Win-T and use the keyboard arrows to navigate the taskbar.  If you have Aero Peek enabled (thumbnails of windows on the taskbar), they will also be shown and you can navigate through them using the arrows.  Using the Win-B key combination, you can navigate through the tray in the same way. <br>  Even faster, you can switch between applications on the taskbar, using the key combination Win- #, where the pound is a number on the main keyboard (Win-1, Win-2, etc.). If the application has not been launched, but is attached to the taskbar , it will start. <br><br><h3>  Hiding the Windows Live Messenger icon </h3><br>  Those who use it are probably annoyed by the inability to remove it from the taskbar.  Nevertheless, this problem is solved quite simply: you need to right-click on the icon in the taskbar, then right-click on the item ‚ÄúWindows Live Messenger‚Äù, select ‚ÄúProperties‚Äù there.  Next, on the appropriate tab, set the compatibility mode with Windows Vista and restart the program.  All the more she does not disturb us - when you close the window minimizes to tray.  This method will help with other programs that in Windows 7 for some reason remain on the taskbar, although they should not. <br><br><h3>  Minimizing windows </h3><br>  Surely someone hears about the Aero Shake feature for the first time.  In fact, it is quite useful - it allows you to minimize all windows except the active one.  To do this, just take the active window for the title and shake it :-).  Fans of hotkeys and maximized windows are encouraged to click the Win-Home combination. <br>  In addition, you can hide all windows altogether (and maximize them back) with the extreme right button on the taskbar or the Win-D key combination, or minimize them with the Win-M key combination. <br><br><h3>  Quickly open and close a copy of the application </h3><br>  If you open the program once and want to open another copy of it, you do not need to go through the shortcuts or the menu.  Just click on the program icon on the taskbar with the Shift key pressed. <br>  There is another, simpler way: you need to click the middle mouse button (wheel). <br>  Another way is to use hotkeys: the Shift-Win- # combination (where the grid is a number on the main keyboard) launches another copy of the program from the taskbar. <br>  In addition, if you need to quickly close an inactive window, you can not reach for a cross on the miniature window on the taskbar or maximize this window.  It is enough to click the middle mouse button (wheel) on the same window thumbnail. <br><br><h3>  Copying files from the command line to multiple threads </h3><br>  Starting from Windows Vista, the <a href="http://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robocopy">robocopy</a> utility <a href="http://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robocopy">will be</a> supplied with the operating <a href="http://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robocopy">system</a> .  Besides the fact that it offers quite a rich functionality, it also has a useful key / MT [: n].  It allows you to copy files into multiple streams (by default, 8, maximum 128).  I think you can not talk about speeding up the copy process with this key. <br><br><h3>  Fast window management </h3><br>  Using the Win key and arrows on the keyboard, you can control the size of the window.  If you press the left and right arrows, the window will unfold to half the screen.  Pressing the up arrow expands the window to full screen, and by pressing the down arrow, you can reduce or minimize it. <br>  Also, if you press Shift-Win and the left or right arrow, the window can be transferred to another monitor. <br><br>  <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Keyboard-shortcuts">List of hotkeys in Windows 7</a> ( <a href="http://www.oszone.net/10429/Windows_7_hot_keys">translation</a> ) </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/119787/">https://habr.com/ru/post/119787/</a></p>
