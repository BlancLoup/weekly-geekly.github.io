      This exam exists in two versions: General (general) and Subject (subject).  The most commonly used test is the GRE General, which allows to evaluate the analytical skills and the general level of knowledge of the candidate.  Its structure is represented by three main sections: verbal, written and mathematical.  Each of them assesses specific skills and knowledge that the student must demonstrate in the course of performing various tasks. <br><br>  <a href="http://www.ets.org/gre/subject/about%3FWT.ac%3Dgrehome_gresubject_130807">GRE Subject</a> is different from the general exam.  His main task is to evaluate the candidate‚Äôs knowledge of a particular subject that is specialized for his chosen specialty.  This test is conducted in such disciplines as biochemistry, biology (molecular and cellular), physics, mathematics, computer science, psychology, chemistry and English literature.  The structure of the exam is represented by a set of specialized questions, the number of which depends on the subject being passed. <br><br>  As a rule, this exam is used by foreign universities and business schools.  Test results are required for enrolling an applicant for postgraduate programs: Master Degree, Postgraduate, MBA and EMBA.  GRE General is most often required for admission to courses related to management, business, finance, management and economics.  Subject exam is needed to study in narrow specialties. <br><br>  <b>Test content</b> <br><br>  The GRE exam has only three sections: Analytical Writing, Verbal Reasoning, and Quantitative Reasoning.  Each section will test a specific area of ‚Äã‚Äãknowledge, but all of them are aimed at assessing the candidate‚Äôs analytical skills.  For example, in the verbal section there are 40 questions, answering which you need to demonstrate not only the ability to understand the printed text, but also your argumentation skills. <br><br>  The math section also contains 40 assignments.  However, all her tasks are focused, first of all, on checking the candidate's ability to analyze numerical data and put into practice basic mathematical models.  The analytical writing section contains only two assignments, but they will require deep knowledge of grammar, spelling, style, and good argumentation skills. <br><br>  GRE is highly complex and requires advance preparation.  To successfully pass the test, the candidate must be fluent in English, know the grammar, have a large vocabulary and know mathematics.  But most importantly, you need to be able to analyze information, draw your own conclusions and find solutions using the available data. <br><br>  <b>Test rating system</b> <br><br>  After passing all three sections of the exam, you will receive a final score.  Each correct answer in the parts of Verbal Reasoning and Quantitative Reasoning will be scored 1 point.  For these sections you can score from 130 to 170 points.  Analytical Writing is rated separately on a scale from 0 to 6 points in increments of 0.5 points.  If there is no answer, you will get 0 points (No Score (NS)). <br><br>  GRE Subject Test is rated slightly different.  The rating scale is fixed from 200 to 990 points in increments of 10 points.  Also in such disciplines as Biochemistry, Biology, Cellular and Molecular Biology, Psychology, an additional point is indicated.  It is calculated on a scale from 20 to 99 points in steps of one point. <br><br>  Only by understanding what the <a href="http://www.mbaconsult.ru/ru/GRE/">GRE test is</a> , you can build an effective training plan, taking into account your strengths and weaknesses.  In turn, a good learning strategy will ensure the successful passing of the test and will give a chance to enter the selected program. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/a02/a95/a20/a02a95a2042446ae9ee5da365096e5c0.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  <b>Secrets of effective training</b> <br><br>  To successfully pass the GRE exam, you need to undergo a good preparation.
