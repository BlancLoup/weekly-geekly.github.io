      ‚ÄúWe will stick to this platform [Mandriva],‚Äù said the official, who did not want to give his name. <br><br>  He said that the organization reserves the right to choose any platform that would be better suited to Nigerian students, and in the future this could be Microsoft software. <br><br>  Last week, Mandriva had information that TSC was planning to pay for its software configuration services, but then sharply decided to replace the operating system with Windows XP.  TSC placed an order with a local Microsoft vendor on Windows XP and an MS Office package.  Such a turn raised the question of the reasons that made TSC first send public money to buy computers with Mandriva, and then increase the costs for buying and installing Windows. <br><br>  The question of which operating system will take advantage is very important, since TSC is the largest supplier of Intel Classmate PCs in West Africa and is expected to reach 100,000 computers over time.  The situation also sheds light on the fight against Linux, which Microsoft is deploying in developing countries whose governments are interested in software with the lowest licensing costs. <br><br>  Microsoft says that Nigeria still requires Windows.  Microsoft's regional manager in Nigeria, Chinenye Mba-Uzokvu (Chinenye Mba-Uzoukwu), told the IDG News Service on Thursday that, according to TSC, there is a ‚Äúpreference for the tested platform,‚Äù meaning Windows, but refrained from further comment. <br><br>  Currently, Intel has tested and certified three operating systems for the Classmate PC: Mandriva Linux, Metasys Linux, and Microsoft Windows XP Pro. <br><br>  Mba-Uzokvu wrote that an agreement is being negotiated with TSC, according to which Microsoft will provide 400 thousand dollars for marketing activities related to Classmate PC computers, if Windows is installed on them. <br><br>  The official statement says: ‚ÄúMicrosoft is able to provide a comprehensive solution for the education system, including software, training and technical support for 17,000 Classmate PCs in 200 schools in Nigeria.‚Äù <br><br>  Following <a href="http://www.habrahabr.ru/blog/lenta/29185.html">public statements</a> made by Mandriva‚Äôs executives, who did not rule out that such a marketing agreement was illegal, Microsoft last week reported that it did not violate international law and comply with the laws of the countries in which it operates. <br><br>  It's not clear how much TSC was going to pay for each license on Windows XP.  Attempts to contact the leaders of the TSC company, which is a division of the consulting company Altecq.ict, failed. <br><br>  At the same time, the details of the deal between Mandriva and TSC appeared.  According to local partner Mandriva, a modified version of the operating system, including technical support, is available for $ 10 per copy. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/31300/">https://habr.com/ru/post/31300/</a></p>
