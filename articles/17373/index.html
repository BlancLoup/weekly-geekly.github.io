Number <br>  System crashes: 2 <br>  The bad news.  The European Parliament, after several years of lobbying by large corporations, has voted in favor of software patents, and the governments of EU countries must adopt the appropriate amendments to national legislation in two years.  cancellation of this decision at the last moment seems unlikely;  however, many still entertain themselves with the hope that the directive will not apply to ‚Äúclean‚Äù programs.  The rest migrate to Africa.  All existing patents filed with the European Patent Office have been confirmed <br>  according to new laws. <br><br>  <strong>February 3, 2007</strong> <br>  Number of Linux distributions: 556;  number of text editors: 39 (no one wants to use Emacs while doing this) <br>  Microsoft has released a new version of its operating system, previously bore the codename Vista.  However, everyone foresaw such a "surprise", so there is nothing special about that. <br>  Today, Apple introduced Mac OS X 10.5 "Leopard", the first release that fully runs on Pentium processors.  There are no big improvements in any OS, but it's funny to watch how people ignore Microsoft, preferring Apple solutions.

      <strong>October 31, 2007</strong> <br>  Number of Linux distributions: 692;  number of web browsers: 32 (all but one are based on Mozilla) <br>  Three weeks ago, Dr. David Okokh, a Nigerian entrepreneur and multimillionaire, died in a plane crash.  His relatives sent an e-mail with a request to help bring his fortune out of the country, offering 10% to anyone who would help.  unfortunately, no one believed them, and the money was stolen by unscrupulous bank employees.  The moral of this story is approximately the same as in the story about a boy who constantly shouted "VOLKIII!". <br><br>  <strong>March 6, 2008</strong> <br>  Number of Linux distributions: 720;  full installation size of OpenOffice.org: 3 GB. <br>  George Bush obtained permission to rewrite the US Constitution to allow the presidents to be at the helm of more than 2 terms.  Previously, it was considered impossible, but the annual advertising campaign in each newspaper, on radio stations, television channels, Internet sites and camps <br>  Girl Scouts finally did their job.  No one knows where the money comes from for an advertising campaign, the sponsor is unknown.  However, the opportunity to serve a third term and to be elected to him are different things ... <br><br>  <strong>August 14, 2008</strong> <br>  Number of Linux distributions: 751;  number of Tetris clones: 40. <br>  Despite losing litigation with Novell and IBM in 2006, SCO recently returned to the Linux market.  The main feature of the SCO distribution this time is full compatibility with Microsoft products.  The distribution looks and works like Longhorn, easily connects to Windows Server 2007, and even falls from time to time to a blue screen <br>  of death.  It seems that any company that produces so much fuss around someone who potentially uses its proprietary code should be more careful - especially with Microsoft. <br><br>  <strong>January 20, 2009</strong> <br>  Number of Linux distributions: 802;  The current version of Beagle is 0.0.99.99.29. <br>  Well, after his failure last year, Bush returned to the US presidency.  His unusually high rating is not at all surprising - the victory of the USA in the war with Iran helped him earn considerable political capital.  More interesting is the post of vice president: who would <br>  I would have thought Bill Gates was interested in politics for other news ‚Äî a popular Google service, and Gmail was finally out of beta testing. <br><br>  <strong>September 29, 2009</strong> <br>  Number of Linux distributions: 888;  number of KDE options: 20293 (more than half of them repeat each other). <br>  It seems that the end of the world is approaching: I am holding in my hand a box with ‚ÄúDuke Nukem Forever‚Äù bought at a nearby computer store.  The only bad thing is that it will not run on my video card, I had to order a new GeForce X from NVIDIA.  Curiously, my new video card will contain more memory than all the other devices in my computer. <br><br>  <strong>February 27, 2010</strong> <br>  Number of Linux distributions: 920;  average processor speed: 800 MHz. <br>  Vice President Gates still behaves quietly: he does not go to many government dinners and only occasionally meets with the press.  In general, it can rarely be seen outside the walls of his bedroom.  This proves the popular opinion that it is on his conscience that the law, which <br>  allows you to shoot software pirates on the spot.  Even the phrase "software pirate" is too scary to take it for capital punishment. <br><br>  <strong>May 19, 2010</strong> <br>  Number of Linux distributions: 985;  OSI approved licenses: 401. <br>  We all saw, but it did not become less shocking: IBM sold its server division to Lenovo.  These smart Chinese were able to double IBM PC sales five years ago, and it seems they intend to do the same in the server market.  Carly Fiorina, CEO of IBM, said: "We want to focus on software and support ‚Äî we believe in Linux."  Indeed, noble thoughts. <br><br>  <strong>April 18, 2011</strong> <br>  Number of Linux distributions: 1192;  Number of Linux viruses: 101209 (9 out of 10 work through Wine). <br>  Following sharp arguments in a public list, Richard Stallman left the Free Software Foundation!  After announcing his retirement, the first thing he did was to say everything he thought about the GPL;  in fact, the GPL is not free enough, and everyone should urgently switch to the BSD license.  Everyone thought it was pretty funny, until Stallman showed a hidden link on the FSF website, <br>  appeared a few months ago and contains a literal reprint of the BSD license under the heading "GPL v4".  People who licensed their programs under "GPL v2 or later" are rioting.  It is doubtful whether Stallman will survive another month? <br><br>  <strong>August 10, 2011</strong> <br>  Number of Linux distributions: 1251;  mailbox volume GMail: 2 TB. <br>  The long 18 months of ATI's agony are finally over - NVIDIA bought a Canadian company for a meager amount of $ 556 million. ATI has failed since 2008, when the first real games for mobile phones appeared, and this week the last hope disappeared: ID Software <br>  (now part of Microsoft, of course) has released Doom 5 for MS Smartphone, which supports only NVIDIA graphics cards.  This is probably a good move for the industry as a whole: NVIDIA continues its graphic innovations. <br><br>  <strong>February 20, 2012</strong> <br>  Number of Linux distributions: 1490; <br>  the number of pages in the Gnome HID: 1012 User Interface Design Guide. <br>  Linux robots have been trying to find out if <em>androids</em> really dream about e-sheep.  the answer is no.  $ 500 billion spent for good reason. <br><br>  <strong>March 1, 2012</strong> <br>  Number of Linux distributions: 1494; <br>  Sendmail known critical vulnerabilities: 420. <br>  Latest news: US prisons are overcrowded - the guards closed the doors on the bolts and refuse to accept new prisoners.  It all started after the Supreme Court decided <br>  imprison for 1 year for each illegally downloaded audio or film, which led to a significant reduction in the number of free cameras.  In the last year, the situation has improved slightly, because  RIAA agreed to transfer half of the received fines for the maintenance of prisons.  But now this is not enough. <br><br>  <strong>October 11, 2012</strong> <br>  Number of Linux distributions: 1540;  Percentage of programmers working in Indochina: 85%. <br>  Another mystery is revealed: SCO was bought by Microsoft, forming a branch called MicroSCOft.  This explains how SCO was able to achieve near-full compatibility with Windows in its recent releases, as well as where did the money come from for litigation against Linux.  Many have long joked about Microsoft entering the Linux market - I wonder what they will say now that this has happened? <br><br>  <strong>June 2, 2013</strong> <br>  Number of Linux distributions: 1680;  Number of IRC networks: 2 (both owned by AOL). <br>  Emacs 2.0 came out, which came as a surprise to many.  Many years ago, the number ‚Äú1‚Äù was dropped from the version number of Emacs (for example, Emacs 21 was actually 1.21), on the grounds that it never changed.  Now the main figure is returned.  What caused such changes? Hot keys in the Vim style by default.  Now we can confidently say that the text editors' war is over ... <br><br>  <strong>September 13, 2013</strong> <br>  Number of Linux distributions: 1776;  the ratio of spam to legitimate messages: 16 to 1. <br>  Today is Friday the 13th, and therefore the most superstitious were surprised to learn that Debian 3.2 was finally released.  The port for AMD64 is not yet ready, but the new installer finally uses the view <br>  X. This is such a significant step that no one noticed that the default distribution is still <br>  uses kernel 2.4.  But even this faded into the background when we heard that Microsoft <br>  sued Red Hat, citing multiple patent infringements.  Most likely it can <br>  will be able to increase MicroSCOft sales, but apparently these events are not related ... <br><br>  <strong>October 25, 2014</strong> <br>  Number of Linux distributions: 1641;  average time between warnings (announcements): 12 seconds. <br>  Apple was forced to add Linux support to the iPod after adding all the existing features.  The device is still very attractive, but the battery needs a truck with a lift. <br><br>  <strong>December 19, 2014</strong> <br>  Number of Linux distributions: 1492;  Number of Internet search engines: 2 (Microscoogle and Astalavista). <br>  Intel made two important announcements this week.  First, the production of the Itanium processor line is discontinued.  According to general opinion, this is due to the fact that the processor appeared with a decade late.  But at least Intel has the ability to sell Xeon 6 chips at reduced prices to those who need Itanium.  The other news is, of course, the release of the Xeon 6 itself - it supports the EM128T, including the 128-bit mode for x86, a new SSE5 instruction set has been added to the processor, as well as even more general-purpose registers. <br>  AMD responded by stating that 128-bit for the desktop computer is not needed, but made a report on its secret project ‚ÄúSamhill‚Äù to add EM128T support to its chips. <br><br>  <strong>June 30, 2015</strong> <br>  Number of Linux distributions: 1076;  The number of currencies in the world: 3 (yuan, euro dollars, oil barrels). <br>  This is the beginning of the end. This morning came the news that Red Hat lost the court with Microsoft and will have to pay Microsoft several billion Eurodollars.  It later turned out that Red Hat did not have enough money, and she thought it would be better to team up with Novell than to admit <br>  bankrupt yourself.  The new company will be named No Hat - I hope they will be better together ... <br><br>  <strong>November 1, 2015</strong> <br>  Number of Linux distributions: 404;  number of software patents: 402395 (three quarters belong to American companies). <br>  AMD introduced AMD128, calling for the transition to 128-bit processors on desktop computers.  No one was surprised. <br><br>  <strong>January 15, 2016</strong> <br>  Number of Linux distributions: 38;  Number of Certified MicroSCOft Engineers: 45293000. <br>  Since Red Hat lost to Microsoft, the number of Linux distributions has decreased from more than 1,000 to 38, with 29 developers already receiving notification from Microsoft lawyers about patent infringement. <br><br>  <strong>April 9, 2017</strong> <br>  Number of Linux distributions: 2;  average laptop battery life: 20 minutes. <br>  As I already wrote, there are only two Linux distributions left on the market: No Hat (a product of Red Hat / Novell) and MicroSCOft.  Linux itself has been changed so much that these distributions are incompatible with each other, neither at the program level, nor even at the source code level.  MicroSCOft allows any user to create, edit and delete any files, install programs and <br>  run viruses.  However, the distribution kit is distributed free of charge on every DVD with Windows: Windows itself occupies 20 GB, and on the remaining 20 GB there is the MicroSCOft distribution kit, which ensures the operation of all types of packages out of the box. <br><br>  <strong>November 5, 2017</strong> <br>  No one believes that No Hat will be able to fight, because all computers are sold with a reinstalled MicroSCOft. <br><br>  <strong>August 20, 2018</strong> <br>  Number of Linux distributions: 1;  number of mobile phones: 6492102000. <br>  After signing profitable OEM contracts, MicroSCOft gained 90% of the distribution market, but could not get the remaining 10% owned by No Hat (until today).  then Microsoft sued Linus torvalds, and since he is not able to withstand such a monster, <br>  decided to admit prematurely guilty in all respects.  Since Linus cannot pay huge fines, Microsoft offered him a deal: all charges will be dropped if he <br>  work on MS as a Windows developer.  What Torvalds chose is unknown. <br><br>  <strong>July 4, 2019</strong> <br>  Number of Linux distributions: 1;  Microsoft Redmond campus size: 196 square miles. <br>  Approximately 30 years later than planned, GNU / Hurd 1.0 (codename Linus, in memory of Linus Torvalds) was released.  now the future of free software depends <br>  Sit from him ... <br><br>  I do not know about you, but I like to reread these predictions. <br>  Linux Format # 71 p.56 </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/17373/">https://habr.com/ru/post/17373/</a></p>
