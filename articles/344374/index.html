  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Case SMS working on customer loyalty</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  SMS notifications work not only in the areas of shopping, leisure and entertainment, but also in such an important area as healthcare.  We describe how SMS allowed Heliks Laboratory Service to increase customer loyalty and reduce the number of missed methods. <br><br><h3>  <b>Tasks</b> </h3><br>  Due to the presence of failures in the delivery of SMS messages, the question of channel duplication arose.  It was necessary to find a provider who could ensure uninterrupted information service for timely reminding clients about the appointment to the doctor, sending PIN codes for authorization, notification of the readiness of test results. <br><br>  According to the statistics of "Helix", before the introduction of SMS-informing, 9% of patients who signed up through the contact center or online services to see a doctor did not reach the doctor.

      After analyzing the feedback, it was revealed that patients forget about the visits, since there are no reminder systems, the rest of the consumers in most cases have more important things to do during the visit.  As a result, doctors lost their working hours, and the company lost the profits from missed appointments. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h3>  <b>Decision</b> </h3><br>  At the beginning of cooperation, Infobip acted as a backup SMS provider, but, having shown the best level of delivery, became the main one. <br><br>  The next step was the integration of a multi-channel solution: Helix included Viber in the list of channels of communication with customers. <br><br>  The problem with patients who did not reach the doctor, "Helix" began to solve even before working with Infobip, selecting SMS as a channel to send reminders about the appointment to the doctor.  Later, testing different scenarios of a multi-channel solution, the Helix team came to the conclusion that two reception reminders work most effectively. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/mr/x3/q8/mrx3q86-k3ctk6ju9_u2-uya1se.jpeg" alt="image"><br><br><h3>  <b>results</b> </h3><br>  Laboratory Helix uses a multi-channel solution based on the Viber scenario + backup SMS.  The cost of delivering a Viber message is two times lower than sending an SMS.  Therefore, Viber is selected as the main communication channel.  If a message is not delivered to Viber (for example, there is no Internet connection or the client does not use Viber), it is automatically sent via the backup SMS channel.  In this undelivered message Viber is not paid. <br><br>  With the introduction of OMNI, Helix reduced the cost of SMS notification by 20%.  There are plans to further reduce costs through mobile push-notifications.  The final mailing script will look like this: Push + backup Viber channel + backup SMS.  For the implementation of this plan, Helix has all the possibilities, including the client‚Äôs own mobile application, which has already been installed by more than 200 thousand people. <br><br>  In the mailings of "Helix" an important place is occupied by reminders about the appointment to the doctor.  So why is it more advantageous to send two admission reminders? <br>  Helix clients receive the first SMS reminder 24 hours prior to reception, and another one - 3 hours.  This decision reduced the number of missed receptions from 9% to 4% - an excellent result.  With the setting of the information system, other indicators were achieved: <br><br><ul><li>  the number of calls to the contact center has decreased; </li><li>  the number of outgoing calls to customers decreased; </li><li>  increased customer loyalty, and hence the number of repeat visits; </li><li>  increased the number of downloads of the mobile application; </li><li>  conversion from pre-orders to real orders has increased. </li></ul></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/344374/">https://habr.com/ru/post/344374/</a></p>
