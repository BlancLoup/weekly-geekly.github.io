  <section class="page js-page"><h1>winmobile devices - like</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/38d/d10/cef/38dd10cef8c2b34145741b61fa9af667.jpg"><br>  new, aha ... present, aha ... advanced in technical terms, aha ... in my hands were devices 5 on the winmobile, my opinion was formed long ago.  there was 1 (I-mate K-JAM) with a keyboard (an analogue, more precisely, the originator shown above).  And even then I was visited by the thought that <strong>everything microsoft touches</strong> , and who he urges to work on ( <a href="http://pudovkin.com/2007/09/winmobile-zhalobyi-priturka/">Hindus, what did winmobile</a> or Japanese-Chinese, what devices do under it - HTC) <strong>suffers usability, stability, but</strong> , like showcase, <strong>replete with functionality and quality of the imaginary market freely competing solutions</strong> (meaning other platforms).  so. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  <strong>We look ...</strong> there is an iron clave (the necessary functionality in any communicator and PDA, because Wirth. Klava does not cope, and there is nothing to do by hand in the winmobile. In the palm trees a little bit to my friend).  and, in appearance, not bad.  What can she do?  walk on the arrows.  take out button, Fn indicators and capslocks.  The key ( <strong>.</strong> ) - tzitska.  see functional (and two ( <strong>.</strong> ) ( <strong>.</strong> ) more functional, since two tsytsky).  Caps \ Shift key. <br><br>  <strong>What do we need a keyboard for?</strong>  enter characters, simplify navigation (to increase speed, performance) on OS and applications, display service information (in this instance), use keyboard shortcuts (which cannot be done on virtual keys or graphite). <br><br>  <strong>What we have?</strong> <br><ul><li>  The block of arrows is merged with a common row of keys, which makes it difficult to work blindly, there is no tactile feedback.  This is a minus of ALL existing devices with a vertical slider. </li><li>  the Take out button and the OK button are located next to each other, which automatically causes errors when you click - instead of ok you press EXIT and spend time closing the main menu and vice versa, when you have to go run the program you close (minimize) the OK button. </li><li>  Indicators Fn and capslok take inadmissibly a lot of space.  If there is a need for them (in K-Zhama they were not and did not suffer much. The enthusiasts invented the backup signaling devices (software), which informed about the current layout (!!), the status of the casplok and the keypad. The buttons are inadmissibly a lot of space and positioned them so that they eat up a whole block below them, which could be used for the keyboard, where, what never was, the Ctrl key could finally fit, but more on that below. </li><li>  the key-point allows you to switch the layout (in conjunction with OK. about the pleasure of pressing this key, we will still hear "enthusiastic" cries), enter the numbers.  God be with her.  but where is the most necessary in Windows key STRL?  it allows you to use the clipboard, close the program (which is impossible to do with a cross).  if you want to switch between tasks (al + tab) ... where is it ?!  again, enthusiasts do rewriting and third-party programs (which already loosen the unstable axis), which make it possible ... but why in the 3rd generation of devices there isn‚Äôt all this concern for the user? !!!  The possibility of using STRL is in Wirth.  keyboard.  There you can copy and close the program and for me it is important. </li></ul><br>  I conclude from what I have described that I don‚Äôt need it;  he clones everything already done before him ... blindly, thoughtlessly ... after all this, you don‚Äôt want to go into details about the processor, the screen (which is VGA) and similar cloned and similar characteristics that are thrown from device to device (and in fact this particular device converted from X800).  but there is a 0.3 front camera.

      Yes, in the bath with such developments.  and in the bath the whole NTS ... and GLOFISH (brand) and everyone who tries to make hardkey keys ... in the bath and microsoftware, which makes it difficult for the user to perform elementary functions that are primarily needed in a mobile device, where "on the knee" you need to look at the small screen enter information, process, systematize (that is, look into folders, blocks) and answer / send ... <br><br>  claims not to a specific sample, but to the whole winmobile-kitchen, whether it is okay.  Everyone who takes up production on this platform seems to be tied hand and foot by the interface (there are exceptions in the form of Elf and Samsung with the same idea) or licensing / copywriting restrictions.  But devices from Asus, HTC, Gigabite associates do not offer anything new from generation (not even a device) to generation. <br><br>  more and more often I affirm the thought that all Win * is not for me.  Immediately I recall the kind palm tree (where the correct grain of the user‚Äôs actions, the interaction with the axis, which simply didn‚Äôt include any special keys), psion and, yes, symbian, were laid in the axis.  I can trust S60 more, and I‚Äôm better at working (though not without sin too) a UIQ with an interesting 1 \ 1 keyboard (Sony Ericsson M600, S1i) than a disgruntled, inattentive, canned, if you will, mindless office (s), who I'm deeply uninteresting ... well, and I, too, actually, because I vote with my wallet. <br><br>  and I wish you all.  and above all, to approach competently and thoughtfully to their needs and proposals to their satisfaction <br><br>  - <br>  crosspost <a href="http://pudovkin.com/2007/10/winmobile-apparatyi-kaka/">to yourself</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/14871/">https://habr.com/ru/post/14871/</a></p>
