  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Prototyping in Axure RP PRO 7</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  I have been doing prototyping ever since Axure became known in Russia.  Since 2008.  And the design is much longer.  Although it is possible to call that work design a great stretch.  Rather, the writing of technical specifications, and the design for the simplest sites, in functionality is inferior even to modern promo. <br><br>  I had to learn everything myself, reading books, experimenting on my own projects, training on others.  Changed and complicated technology, and with them, and tools.  And the only program that I could not find an alternative to is Axure.  She allowed all the way to quickly prototyping anything and clearly demonstrate the result to the client and the other participants in the process. <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  If the work of a designer can be compared with the work of an architect working with drawings, then the work of a prototyping specialist is more like a 3D artist who makes a virtual three-dimensional layout of a building according to these drawings.  According to this layout, you can walk around and see how the building will actually look like before it is built.  With the drawings it will not work.  If we continue to draw analogies, the drawing of the building is the functional specification of the project.  And all the accompanying documentation is already a complete technical task.  And the more complex the project, the more complex these three components become and the less they can live without each other.  However, I seem to be distracted.

      Over the years working with the program, having made a couple of hundreds of prototypes, I got so used to its interface and gained so many patterns and patterns that now I can‚Äôt be completely distracted by the application side of implementing one or another prototype, giving all my efforts to design, not prototyping.  And when I meet people who ask how to make the ‚Äúslides scroll through‚Äù or ‚Äúthe menu unfold‚Äù, I get annoyed, forgetting that I once did not know how to do it all.  ‚ÄúIn the prototype there should be no dynamic elements, this will complicate its transfer to the designer,‚Äù I say.  But then, having cooled down, I understand that sometimes they still need to be used, and I once didn‚Äôt know how to do it myself. <br><br>  And then I created an Axure group in contact, in which I answer everyone who wishes to any questions, even stupid from my point of view.  Moreover, not only on prototyping, but also on the general principles of design and work with clients.  If you wish, you can easily find it or have been in it for a long time. <br><br>  After that, I started recording small screencasts: <br>  - <a href="http://youtu.be/NMKLkqktLAM">Rapid prototyping in Axure</a> <br>  - <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3D7Xwty7a6rEY">How to paste the navigation menu to the top of the page when scrolling</a> <br>  - <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3DHfzJXCbqLo0">Global Variables</a> <br>  - <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3DM6-m1FY5wRo">Active item in the navigation menu</a> <br>  - <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3DbE9GJPf7fcg">Work with anchors</a> <br>  - <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3DHG0E5N5Cn6Q">Emerging questions and answers</a> <br>  - <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3DM-RfX8QAvK8">All about drop down menus</a> <br><br>  And most importantly, I do all this for free.  But I see that the demand for such information in certain circles is very high, so the situation may change over time. <br><br>  On top of that, I am organizing a webinar on behalf of the Protorate, my design office.  Again, if you wish, you can easily find this information too. <br><br>  Rather, I do not PR, but I say: "There is a bag of information, which was not there when I started."  Come and choose what you need.  Love foreign primary sources - I will tell you in which sections of the Axure forum to appear.  Need articles in Russian?  Ask questions where I can answer them - and thanks to you, the requested information will be available to the entire community. <br><br>  On this, perhaps, it is worth rounding.  It makes no sense to write about the advantages of Axure 7 version before 6, it would take too much space and episodes.  I will only mention that my work speed has increased by 40% with the release of the seven.  Also, I did not write this text for those who have no idea what Axure is and interactive prototypes.  I'll write it later in another hub. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/204810/">https://habr.com/ru/post/204810/</a></p>
