I want to tell you about a new resource for coin collectors, the <a href="http://www.ucoin.ru/">Ucoin.ru</a> project <br><br>  Any collector who is seriously interested in collecting coins, sooner or later, has several problems - streamlining an ever-increasing collection, figuring out "what else is there to collect?"

      We have tried using our resource to solve these problems as much as possible for a beginner and a continuing coin collector.  Also, it will be interesting and easy for a person to visit Ucoin.ru site to see how the coins of this or that historical period, their descriptions and comments of other users looked. <br><br>  It can be said that the UCOIN site is for those who <br><br>  * Collects or does not collect coins yet <br>  * You have a lot of different coins and you do not know how best to organize them. <br>  * You cannot identify a coin <br>  * You are trying to find out what you need to collect <br>  * You are interested in information about coins. <br>  * You want to have access to your collection from anywhere in the world. <br>  * You are interested in how coins look <br>  * You want to see the coins of other collectors and want to show your collection <br>  * You do not know how to start collecting coins <br><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  <strong>The main idea of ‚Äã‚Äãthe project</strong> is to create an electronic version of its collection in accordance with our constantly updated catalog of countries and historical periods.  You add coin to coin to your collection on the site, indicating the country, denomination, add images of their obverse and reverse, and getting a general picture, find out where there are still gaps in your collection.  A secondary opportunity is that by visiting our website you can select the country and historical period you want to see, which coins were minted then, their denominations, various characteristics like weight, material, diameter, edge, etc., look at the images in the coin catalog and user collections. <br><br><h2>  Main features of the project </h2><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/7f1/198/8ee/7f11988eea7ef43695f30bf8e6a01c53.jpg" alt="image"><br>  <strong>The coin catalog</strong> is the main section of the site.  You can select any country in the menu of the coin catalog and get to the page of the gallery of coins associated with this country.  With the help of filters you can choose the denominations you need, year and period.  You can also filter the coin gallery by tags that site collectors have tied them to. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/8f6/22c/93d/8f622c93d0300b30ff2c92cf45509abc.jpg" alt="image"><br>  If you click on the name of the period in the menu of the coin catalog, then you will see a table showing all the coins of the regular coinage of this historical period.  You can select coins minted for sets or variations of regular coinage using filters.  You can also go to the table of commemorative coins minted during this period. <br>  It is with the help of this table, just filled in the My collection section that you can see what you have left to add to the collection. <br><br>  The main feature of the Coin Catalog is that its content is maintained by the site administrator, which eliminates confusion, such as the appearance of two identical countries, but with a different spelling.  Now the content of the catalog is adjusted using polls on the main page of the site, where users choose which country will be added next.  Also, users can contact the administrator through the feedback form.  In the future, it is planned that users themselves will replenish directories of countries, periods, currencies and denominations, with the help of the administrator and his moderation capabilities. <br><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/c1f/743/c69/c1f743c69835e8a27f2955a03c7d7d84.jpg" alt="image" align="left"><br>  <strong>My collection</strong> is a section for your personal coin collection.  After registration, you can add the first coin to the collection.  Each coin in the collection can indicate its condition, images of the obverse and reverse, the color of the cell in the table, and the author's comment.  After adding at least one coin to the collection, this period will appear in your user directory.  Any coin in the collection can be hidden, not available for viewing by other users or guests of the site. <br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><h2>  Additional features </h2><br>  * Above each table of the historical period, you can see the monetary system used at this time; <br><br>  * If the country has a traditional date number system, a link to the date calculator appears, which can be used to decipher the date when identifying a coin; <br><br>  * If you wish, you can use the interface in English, available on the link <a href="http://www.ucoin.net/">Ucoin.net</a> .  In the future, other language versions of the project are planned; <br><br>  * News and project updates can be seen in the news section and via RSS. <br><br><h2>  Future plans and project development </h2><br>  * Continued increase in available countries and periods; <br><br>  * The project has been active for the last six months.  Today, the number of registered users on the site has exceeded one hundred people, of whom one-fifth are active (constantly replenishing their coin collection); <br><br>  * Adding user interaction with each other (commenting on copies of coins, highlighting duplicate coins and coins intended for exchange and sale). <br><br><h2>  Competitors </h2><br>  In this specific area there are several sites of similar orientation and similar functionality, but it is our project that distinguishes them from being user-oriented and its collection, the ability to streamline the collection according to historically correct reference books, a more convenient interface, active support and development of the project. <br><br>  We invite everyone to visit our project.  We will be very grateful for the feedback and comments. <br></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/69239/">https://habr.com/ru/post/69239/</a></p>
