  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Livebase.ru - a year later</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Moscow without Muscovites is almost a reality.  At least, without the "indigenous" - I have long been accustomed to the fact that most of my friends - by default, visitors, and the person who was born and raised in the capital - it's just some kind of exotic.  And what is needed first of all for those who have taken a deep breath?  That's right, housing.  But not on the pillars of the same ads to break, in fact.  Yes, and buy newspapers - somehow nekomilfo. <br><br> <a href="http://livebase.ru/"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/838/bb0/377/838bb0377cc8d899bf376e7063e3bdc4.jpg" width="700" height="390" alt="62.44 KB"></a> <br><br>  The <a href="http://livebase.ru/">Livebase.ru</a> project, an online rental housing base announced late last year, is undergoing a renaissance.  Some time ago, the creators of this project asked me to talk about how he was doing all this time, what news and what he could offer to users.  The topic came up pretty well, since I myself am planning a relocation in the near future, and I have a purely practical interest in such resources.

    <a name="habracut"></a>  The first impression of the site is a pleasant one - a comfortable and laconic design, without fashionable, how-to-webdvanol glossy trinkets.  The service works elementary: select the region of interest on the map or enter the search in the search bar, in the menu you set the required filters - and see the number of objects at the addresses you need.  On the right is a tag cloud, taking a look at the complex that can provide a general idea of ‚Äã‚Äãthe popularity or demand for particular areas.  For example, VIKHINO catches the eye - it must be assumed that it implies, among other things, Zamkad Novokosino and Kozhukhovo.  Similar story with Shchelkovskaya, Altufevo, etc.  By the way, do not go, children, in Vykhino - in the mornings you will get the hell out of there. <br><br>  Under the map - a list of recently added objects.  On click, they open in a new tab, which is convenient.  On the advertisement page there is a complete set of relevant information: a photo - if there are similar objects, even a code for inserting it into a blog (I wonder - why? Boast?), And the opportunity to complain about incorrectness. <br><br><h4>  Apartment base </h4><br>  Perhaps the most important thing in such projects is the base of apartments.  Livebase currently has approximately 26,000 apartments in the database.  The database is up-to-date - ads must be updated every 6 days, otherwise they are removed.  Now mostly ads from agencies, but the functionality allows you to add ads yourself. <br><br><blockquote>  By the way, compared to the same newspapers, online ad bases have a specific advantage: infa in newspapers no longer differs in honesty and relevance from ads on poles - these are purely advertisements designed to separate a person to a call to a specific agency, where they will already professionally hang noodles on their ears.  And you can‚Äôt cope with it in any way - except to break the newspaper in a rage, call the telephone number indicated, and say everything you think about them - but, in general, they are trying to achieve this.  Working back link mechanisms are one of the advantages of online. </blockquote><br><br><h4>  check in </h4><br>  Made quite convenient, email confirmation is not required, but confirmation of the phone number is necessary, which is logical, given the specifics of the topic.  Disadvantages - pressing Enter when the phone number is filled out is not perceived, you have to wield the mouse.  When I first tried to register, he told me that my email on <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/users/yandex/" class="user_link">yandex.</a> Ru already turned out to be registered, but I was too lazy to remember the password, so I quietly re-registered the same box, but in the <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/users/yandex/" class="user_link">yandex</a> .com domain :) Unfortunately due The ended telephone numbers that could be requested to register, to arrange my favorite check for the possibility of creating an acca from mail @ mailforspam.com or @ odnorazovoe.ru, failed :) <br><br><h4>  Black list </h4><br>  The most controversial section of the site is the <a href="http://livebase.ru/black_agents">board of shame for the punished agents</a> , supplemented by their former employers.  Actually, this section is only interesting for employers - how a realtor has a relationship with an agency to a person who has gathered to rent a house does not talk about anything.  This section is full of batthurst and clarification of relationships, but about how conscientiously certain agents do their job, how they communicate with customers, etc.  for some reason there is no word.  I suspect because their bosses didn‚Äôt care :) Perhaps the situation would be corrected by customer reviews - every registered user can add it, but so far, again, only agents hang out there. <br><br><h4>  Monetization </h4><br>  Everyone is usually interested in what this or that project is going to earn.  On this account, I have first-hand information: there is no advertising on Livebase and it is not planned, paid services ‚Äúsend SMS, I‚Äôm not a sucker, and we will pick you a real hut‚Äù too.  He earns a project on the <a href="http://livebase.ru/plans">sale of paid accounts</a> for agencies, and packages of documents - all kinds of contracts, receipts and other things - for agents. <br><br><h4>  Articles and blogs </h4><br>  There are only a few articles - how to rent / rent an apartment, how to rent a room - but they are informative enough - for example, did you know that the landlord, evicting a tenant before the expiration of the contract, is <a href="http://livebase.ru/lodger">obliged to find him a new home</a> ? <br><br>  There are blogs, where without them.  There, too, there are a number of interesting texts, but I could not master all this abundance of beeches, so I will limit myself to stating the similarity in the design of announcements of posts with the lookatme - not the worst, in principle, an example to follow: <br><br> <a href="http://livebase.ru/posts"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/911/705/4f3/9117054f3ccfb4b3abcefe7fe3d61371.jpg" width="700" height="370" alt="63.34 KB"></a> <br><br><h4>  How would the conclusion </h4><br>  It is practically impossible to live in Moscow and not to face the rental market - whoever does not rent, he rents out.  And the housing problem is still not included in the list of things that can make us better. <br><br>  The Moscow rental market in its configuration is a dinosaur from the 90s: it is practically not regulated by law, 99% in the shadows and lives according to some rules, according to which the customer is not always not always right, and certainly not the king, and the cash cow who needs to be raised to the maximum, imposing a minimum of services for the maximum of money.  The reasons for this can be analyzed for a long time - not least in the case of the lack of responsibility of realtors for the results of their work.  But one thing is clear for sure: the need of intermediaries in the matter of renting housing is greatly exaggerated, and the Internet is the main hope of changing the situation. <br><br>  The future is behind sites like livebase.ru, providing direct interaction between tenants and landlords.  Realtors will remain a niche in which professional mediation is really necessary - this is buying and selling, renting abroad and renting commercial real estate. <br><br><h4>  Instead of epilogue </h4><br>  As a confirmation of the thesis about the prospects of renting without intermediaries in Runet, I suggest the following experiment: if you are looking for or renting a house, write about it in the comments - it is quite possible that you are lucky and you save a lot of time and nerves :) I, for example, I am pleased to consider the options for one-room apartments on the green line - write in a personal or by mail egorkotkin@gmail.com. <br><br>  <b>UPD</b> Habraeffekt, the site opens through time.  Press F5. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/100584/">https://habr.com/ru/post/100584/</a></p>
