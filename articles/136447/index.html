However, please note that you will miss all the fun after the conference will not participate in informal communication with the stars.

      Let's take a look at all the speakers who will take the stage on February 10 and see what theme each of them will speak on. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  <b>I.</b>  After morning coffee and greetings from all the participants, <i>Gregg Pollak will</i> leave Envy Labs on the podium with the report "Deciphering Rails 3".  Many people know Gregg primarily as the author of the <a href="http://ruby5.envylabs.com/">Ruby5</a> podcast, the <a href="http://railslab.newrelic.com/scaling-rails">Scaling Rails</a> screencast series and the <a href="http://railsforzombies.org/">Rails for Zombies</a> course.  In other words, if you're into Ruby and once watched videos on rails or listen to podcasts, then you are most likely to have heard Gregg's voice. <br><br>  In his report, Gregg will first of all talk about new and sometimes unobvious things in Rails 3, which, in his opinion, can significantly reduce the amount of code and improve the code in applications.  You can be sure that his report will be at the same high level as his screencasts and courses. <br><br>  <b>Ii</b> .  After Gregg, the microphone and clicker will be transferred to our guest from Brazil - <i>Fabio Akita</i> , with the report "Understanding the Rails web model and scalability options". <br><br>  Surely those who correctly perceive English-speaking tweets know Fabio ( <a href="https://twitter.com/">@AkitaOnRails</a> ) on his blog <a href="http://www.akitaonrails.com/">akitaonrails.com</a> , he is known to others by the popular <a href="https://github.com/akitaonrails/vimfiles">build of configs</a> for Vim.  But, of course, Fabio earned his fame as the leader on the tracks in South America and the Ruby on Rails evangelist.  Up to 30 times a year (!) There is an opportunity to see Fabio on a variety of stages around the world, performing in front of a diverse audience - from beginners to high-level professionals. <br><br>  Fabio will share his experience of participating in a number of projects and will talk about the different ways in which applications can be scaled, including through <a href="http://pusher.com/">Pusher.com</a> . <br><br>  <b>Iii</b> .  The third will be the first national speaker - <i>Ivan Evtukhovich</i> from <a href="http://evilmartians.com/">Evil Martians</a> , with a report on how one of the most <a href="http://groupon.ru/">heavily</a> loaded projects of the recent Runet - <a href="http://groupon.ru/">Groupon.ru</a> - was <a href="http://groupon.ru/">developed</a> . <br><br>  In many ways, this is a unique report, as the guys will talk about building a project for the first time.  Ivan, the project team, will describe in detail how he managed to grow the application from tens of thousands to ten million users, how to maintain a high development rate, while constantly developing new features, deploying the application several times a day and, in parallel, maintain the highest quality code. <br><br>  In addition, they will be touched on the topics of rolling out and configuration (Chef), analyzed examples of work with loads, which were first discussed at the <a href="http://brainwashing.pro/rails">Brainwashing</a> company course.  Including Ivan touches and open-source libraries, which were created during the work on Grupon and are still actively used. <br><br>  <b>Iv</b> .  Naturally, we could not but invite to the conference <i>Blake Mizerani</i> , the author of <a href="http://www.sinatrarb.com/">Sinatra</a> and the employee of <a href="http://www.heroku.com/">Heroku</a> , who will tell about the history of his last project - the second most popular Ruby framework (and for someone, perhaps, the first and only).  Blake resisted for a long time and did not want to talk about Sinatra, but after much persuasion and promises to treat him to tasty <s>water from the Moscow River</s> with vodka and a snack, he nevertheless agreed. <br><br>  The author of Sinatra and the main person in the project will talk about how the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãthe framework appeared, about its influence on modern web development and how Sinatra is growing and developing, as well as how he managed to establish excellent relations with US educational institutions. <br><br>  <b>V.</b>  Under the excellent, fifth, number will be one of the most incendiary speakers - <i>Scott Schacon</i> , IT Director (CIO) <a href="http://github.com/">GitHub</a> . <br><br>  We don‚Äôt have any sense to tell what GitHub is - Scott will do it in detail from two perspectives: first, he will focus on how the product idea came about, how it was developed and grew, what difficulties the development team faced as the Rails application grew;  secondly, Scott promised to share with us the history of the company's development as a business, where the initial 5 people grew to 50, and how they manage to effectively manage not a start-up but a confidently developing medium-sized company and remain as effective as if they were five. <br><br>  <b>Vi</b> .  The first speaker from Europe (straight from Amsterdam) - <i>Josh Calderimis</i> , the author of the popular service <a href="http://travis-ci.org/">Travis CI</a> and his main evangelist, will tell about his creation in all its details and details. <br><br>  Josh is in the top 30 Core Ruby on Rails developers and manages a number of gems, so even listening to Travis is interesting to anyone who writes in ruby.  But Josh will not stop at this: using the example of a large product with a great team, he shares his experience, which everyone can apply in their own project.  Josh promised us to focus on how five different applications emerged from the Travis CI as the complexity and functionality grew, how they were gradually separated from each other and how the team manages their development. <br><br>  Sharing code between applications and the capabilities of engines are constantly discussed by ruby ‚Äã‚Äãdevelopers, so listening to Josh's talk on the example of a large and successful application promises to be doubly exciting. <br><br>  <b>VII</b> .  Under the happy seventh number, the second Russian speaker, <i>Timofey Klimenko</i> from the <a href="http://myhotspot.ru/">Hot Spot,</a> will speak. <br><br>  The topic of Timofey's report is JRuby and everything connected with it: the history of the interpreter, why it should be used in development, and how JRuby is used in his company.  In addition, the capabilities of the JVM platform and its distinguishing features from other programming languages ‚Äã‚Äãwill be affected. <br><br>  <b>Viii</b> .  Finally, the last (but not least), will be another European - <i>Jonathan Leighton</i> from the UK.  Jonathan is a young freelancer, but in his 22 years he enters the Rails Core Team and will report on the topic: "Attributes Unwrapped: Lessons under the surface of Active Record." <br><br>  Invite a member of the Core Team was our goal.  John Leighton is one of the last rubists who received this title.  He will talk about the experience he gained while refactoring Active Record and will focus on how this knowledge can be used by all rubists in their own projects.  Jonathan promised not to miss his ideas on changing the Active Record API, which have every chance to appear in Rails 4. Naturally, as the only member of the Rails development team, Jonathan will have to answer all the questions from the audience :) <br><br>  This is what the program of the coming toaster looks like, before which there are only <a href="http://toster.ru/index.html">20 days</a> left.  All those who wish to take part in the conference, we can only say one thing: do not pull and <a href="http://toster.ru/register.html">buy a ticket now</a> , we are not in China, and Digital October, unfortunately, is not rubber, which means the number of seats is limited!  If you want to take part in the conference and be sure that you have enough space - you should take care of the ticket for yourself and a friend right now. <br><br>  See you at the toaster! <br><br>  <b>PS</b> Follow the blog updates - we will tell you more about each of the speakers and the topic of his report, as you have the opportunity to ask your questions to the speakers right now - write them in the comments, and we will ask them to all speakers, publishing their answers in future posts. <br><br>  All changes and events are published in our twitter: <a href="https://twitter.com/">@toster_ru</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/136447/">https://habr.com/ru/post/136447/</a></p>
