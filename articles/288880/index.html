Puzomerka at the end. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  There is a regional IT press, even if we exclude projects aimed at a mass audience.  Although not every million-plus city can boast of having at least a blogger regularly covering industry events, and there‚Äôs nothing to say about publications with a coherent content model and an established audience. <br><br>  Let's see those projects that work for exactly on the local professional get-together.  I use my base and knowledge, maybe I forgot someone, I will be glad if you add.  Moving from east to west. <br><br>  From Primorye to Krasnoyarsk everything is completely sad.  Found nothing.

      <b>Krasnoyarsk</b> - <a href="http://losin.ru/">http://losin.ru/</a> - Ivan Losin's personal blog.  It has long and regularly covers news on the local web development market, almost daily updates.  Occasionally affects the news of the local telecom. <br>  <b>Barnaul</b> - <a href="http://22ru.ru/">http://22ru.ru</a> / - project of Ivan Dzhenzheny.  New site building in Altai, sometimes a little bit about profile events. <br>  <b>Novosibirsk</b> - <a href="http://www.bonin.ru/">www.bonin.ru</a> - project of Anton Spiridonov.  Almost daily updates about web projects, often about events, sometimes rumors, scandals, intrigues and investigations of the Novosibirsk web. <br>  <b>Ekaterinburg</b> - <a href="http://it-eburg.com/">http://it-eburg.com</a> - this is my project.  I will not talk about myself especially - but we are writing not only about new sites, but also about startups, integration and telecom, and only for professional parties. <br>  <b>Izhevsk</b> - <a href="http://izh-it.ru/">http://izh-it.ru/</a> - a wonderful project by Natalia Bryzgalova, which builds a lively and active community of Izhevsk web developers.  True, Natalya practically does not go beyond the problems of creating websites. <br>  <b>Perm</b> - <a href="http://itibus.ru/">http://itibus.ru/</a> - a rather young project by Olga Suslova, and maybe the youngest among those represented.  In addition to Perm IT news, often publishes materials from other sites.  Where to grow, in my opinion. <br>  <b>Samara</b> - <a href="http://samara-tech.ru/">http://samara-tech.ru</a> - project of the Samara web studio Vivatik.  Vacuuming everything that somehow relates to IT in Samara - from new guests to new cable TV rates.  It turns out a little vinaigrette similar to cnews, but with a Samara accent. <br>  <b>Rostov-on-Don</b> - <a href="http://www.technodrive.ru/">http://www.technodrive.ru</a> - this is probably one of the oldest regional IT portals.  Variations on the topic of regional Cnews - here and new gadgets, and about the local department "K", etc. <br>  <b>Taganrog</b> - <a href="http://thinkit.ru/">http://thinkit.ru/</a> - the project of the oCube studio is one of the most visited regional IT portals.  In addition to computer news, it contains price lists of local computer stores, information about providers, a directory of sites, etc. - what these portals do not usually do in larger cities, but they don‚Äôt forget about local IT pros. <br>  <b>Voronezh</b> - <a href="http://voronezh.in/">http://voronezh.in/</a> - a great project, also mostly lives on web development news.  There are interviews with local experts (occasionally), reference services. <br>  <b>Kaliningrad</b> - <a href="http://itkaliningrad.ru/">http://itkaliningrad.ru/</a> - it‚Äôs also about the local IT market, but there is almost no Kaliningrad news and almost finished with its own content.  Long doubted whether to include it in the list. <br><br>  It is very sad that there are not even the most unpretentious projects in Tomsk, Omsk, Chelyabinsk, Kazan, Nizhny Novgorod, Volgograd and Krasnodar, well, or they are difficult to find.  Kazan, with its ambitions, is generally unforgivable, and Novosibirsk, sorry, one bonin.ru is clearly not enough - there the IT market is much richer. <br><br>  The list seems to be quite large, but the situation is sad.  I often communicate with PR managers of federal companies who need targets in the regions - they agree with me - it's empty on the ground.  This is bad - the press serves as a fastening link in the local community, it helps to build connections, talk about new products that are important here and now, build concrete partnerships, learn about what they have done on a nearby street.  This is sometimes more difficult than finding out about what's new in Silicon Valley.  Yes, it is now very easy to share information through social networks, but this is from time to time.  And the industry press creates a service with all the parameters of this service itself - that is, regularly and, if possible, qualitatively informs participants about what is happening.  I think this is a necessary element in the creation of the very ‚Äúnutrient broth‚Äù from which new projects grow.  We understand that the more professional communication, the more exhaust, and this is good for everyone.  IT companies themselves are often too lazy even to put news on their own site, not only to inform their colleagues in the workshop.  This is my separate headache. <br><br>  In addition, the IT publication performs another important role - translates from Russian to understandable.  News found and processed by a specialized website then diverge from other publications creating the necessary PR effect among the masses, popularizing the industry, products and technologies, etc.  This is all checked and more than once. <br><br>  Why the IT press is not self-generating?  There are several reasons for this. <br><br>  <u>There is no one to create</u> - an IT professional will be engaged in such a project only for the love of art - in the core profession he will always earn more.  Journalists in the IT business have little understanding, and often also fear it because of the specific terminology that serves as the entry threshold.  Even in Yekaterinburg, with its fairly developed media market, journalists understand the IT business ... well, 5 maybe.  In other cities, pen workers who distinguish CMS from CRM are generally impossible to detect. <br>  <u>There is nothing to live for</u> - an IT portal in a single city, and even aimed at a narrow layer of IT managers, is extremely hard to monetize.  Nobody is interested in advertising on it - the audience is too small, and we don‚Äôt have the tools to sponsor such projects.  IT companies do not know how to pay, and bloggers or journalists who could create a local Techcranch do not know how to search, take and dispose of money. <br><br>  For me, the absolute truth is that the local IT press is needed.  Otherwise I would not do it myself.  I was lucky, I found my niche and I see growth directions, although I understand that no such project will have $ 200 thousand per month, like Arrington two years after the creation of the Techcranch. <br><br>  It was food for thought.  Now it remains to decide whether IT press is really needed, if how much is needed, and if it is strong how to create it. <br><br><h4>  Puzomerka </h4><br>  Miniring by the number of subscribers in Google.Reader <br><br>  <b>For comparison:</b> <br>  Roem.ru -1651 <br>  webplanet.ru - 251 <br>  Cmsmagazine.ru - 125 <br>  startuppoint.ru - 125 <br><br><ul><li>  bonin.ru - 176 </li><li>  it-eburg.com - 113 (197 more on rss LJ) </li><li>  losin.ru - 95 </li><li>  thinkit.ru - 68 </li><li>  samara-tech.ru - 34 </li><li>  izh-it.ru - 27 </li><li>  voronezh.in - 18 </li><li>  22ru.ru - 17 </li><li>  itibus.ru -1 </li></ul><br>  PS Add projects from comments: <br>  <b>Khabarovsk</b> - <a href="http://dvblog.ru/">http://dvblog.ru/</a> - Far Eastern Habrahabrik <br>  <b>Kemerovo</b> - <a href="http://42web.ru/">http://42web.ru/</a> - Ilya Gorbarov‚Äôs project.
