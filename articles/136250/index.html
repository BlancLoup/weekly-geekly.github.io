  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Inspiration - your internal motor!</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Ladies and Gentlemen! <br><br>  The last few days I have resumed interest in reading Habr, there are many wonderful, wonderful articles, but there are also those who in a sense ‚Äúload‚Äù - for example, how to make myself do something, how to motivate myself correctly.  It's all great and great, I suggest to look at life from another facet of many existing - from a position of inspiration!  Despite the great difficulties at work, I now have a great mood, and suddenly deciding to write this impromptu, I want to share with you bright thoughts :) <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Life is beautiful!  To truly understand and feel this thought, you just need to imagine yourself without this life.  Does not work?  That's it!  Often we get used in everyday life so much that we take life as a boring reality.  And life is a miracle!  After all, happiness is not in achieving the goal, but on the way to it.  We live, we exist at all, this fact itself fills with joy every moment.  Try to turn on pleasant music, sit comfortably and relax, listen to your breathing - yes, you breathe, this is a miracle!  We so often do not appreciate this, but in vain - look at how a small child is rejoicing, who sees this huge world for the first time.  He is amused by millions of different sounds, colors, sensations, he explores this world bit by bit and enjoys this process.  Just because he does not have a perception filter yet, there is no hard shell that grows around our personality as armor and more and more separates us from understanding that in reality the world is a great mystery, that it is full of wonders and the limits of knowledge are endless. .  Not the world becomes duller or more complex with age, but our perception of it. <br><br>  We can spend our lives on anything, and although we depend on many factors, potentially - we are free!  Everyone is free and independent precisely because he can realize this and become what he wants.  Freedom is perhaps the most valuable gift given to us by the Universe.  Besides, we are people.  Think about it!  We are Humans, not a piece of stone, not a tree, or even a pet, but real thinking and aware creatures!  Is this not a great luck, a gift or whatever it is for us?  Yes, life is difficult, but just as much as we ourselves allow it to deal with us.  It is important to understand that when we always take responsibility, we have the very opportunity to be free - because there is no one to blame!  If something positive happens in life, for example, our work brought a profit (not necessarily material!) Or we did something that made us smile and feel good - we rejoice.  And what if we were deceived / robbed or did badly?  And here there is a fork for thinking, capable of working wonders!  You might think that we are not guilty, the person who is trying to do evil and blame him is to blame.  But this will not make us any better or happier, even if we punish our abuser, even if he admits his guilt and corrects - he will get this experience, but not us!  Even when we are treated unfairly, it is important to take responsibility for ourselves, for example, to ask yourself the question - what am I doing wrong?  Why was it even possible to deceive me or to treat me badly?  And then we will see that the reason is within us!  They were able to do this to me, so I didn‚Äôt have enough experience, so I need to work through this situation so that the next time the result was in my favor!  You can never be the best, but you can always become better than yourself.  Equate yourself not to the people around you, but to yourself, in order to constantly grow above yourself, make yourself spiritually richer, smarter, more qualitative, fill your existence with meaning!  Learn from everything, because experience and the ability to apply it distinguishes great people from those who do not achieve anything.

      Live for your pleasure.  This does not mean that you need to feed only your Wishlist and ignore the opinions of others.  Pleasure is a stretchable thing.  You can stop enjoying sex, and you can enjoy the taste of juicy fruits.  Starting from absolute zero, a state where we do not exist, you can feel the taste and interest of life.  You can come up with a lot of options, for example, imagine that you never existed, and suddenly you appeared in this world for ten minutes and began to feel the reality.  In just ten minutes you will again cease to exist, as if you never existed.  What do you think, how much is a minute of life?  Yes, it is priceless!  All you have is not worth ten minutes of your existence!  You will enjoy colors, sounds, the very breath will give you an incomparable pleasure, smells and tastes will turn your head, and the sensation of the roughness of objects will cause complete delight!  And a five-minute jog will no longer cause thoughts like ‚Äúdifficult, be quicker to finish,‚Äù but there will be something like ‚ÄúWahau, I'm alive !!!  Running is so cool!  Load, gravity, sensations and smells are indescribable! ‚ÄùLife is given in order to enjoy it.  Not only pleasant moments, you can enjoy anything.  He ran, fell, scratched his knee.  It hurts!  It hurts, I feel pain, but in general I feel it, so I'm alive, it's so great!  I was told something unpleasant?  This is no reason to be offended, this is a reason to make yourself better!  I have feelings, I can think, it really does not have a price.  You can literally enjoy everything, because everything is our invaluable life experience that is available only to us - we do not feel ourselves instead of others, which means that we are unique and unique.  And no matter what others do, what we do is important.  In old age, we will regret not what we have done and what we have not done in this one and only life. <br><br>  You can talk about it endlessly, you understand the meaning.  Certainly someone will think - everything is wrong, you fly in the clouds and so on.  But the world has many facets, a lot, and our personal attitude depends on what angle to look at, what point of view to choose.  We live and our life energy can be spent on anything, and no matter how you call it - pessimism, optimism, realism or something else, the forces will be spent equally, and the result will be very different.  We can constantly complain about life, and we can admire the very fact of our existence.  We can do nothing, but we can accumulate our experience and flourish.  Even if something annoys us, starting from the position of our non-existence, we can easily make this feeling pleasant - ‚ÄúI overcome difficulties, it means I exist, and this is already priceless!‚Äù.  Although life seems to be long, looking back at the years you have lived, you flew like an instant, and how, how did we allow ourselves to sometimes grumble at this precious time? <br><br>  Let the positive be your constant companion and the elevated spirit accompany at any time!  As one wise man said, you are a citizen of the world, a part of human history, be proud of it! </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/136250/">https://habr.com/ru/post/136250/</a></p>
