But judging by the information from Western countries, everything is not so tough, and private firms, representatives of rights holders, are engaged in this, simply suing you, without any breaking down of doors, handcuffs, snipers around the perimeter of the block, etc. And you, most likely It will be a lot of time to physically destroy the computer with all the information, without waiting until the court decides to check its contents. <br><br>  In addition, you can have an album in mp3 quite legally on your computer - because you officially bought a CD, everyone understands that no one will listen to the CD in our time.  You can even download an album from torrents, because you have a CD, but you do not know how to transfer it to MP3.  What exactly is impossible is to <u>distribute</u> , no matter how received, the album. <br><br>  Therefore, it does not matter what you have there on the encrypted partition, if the anti-piracy detects distribution from your IP, then you already have problems, and no one will understand that your disk is filled with supposedly random data.  Maybe the court will not prove anything, but you will be provided with such hemorrhoids that you yourself agree to agree amicably and pay some amount that suits both parties.  But the police, handcuffs, witnesses and others will be if you want to be attracted for using unlicensed software (and as far as I understand, they will have to prove what you are getting from this commercial advantage), which in the case of Ubuntu is not as relevant as pumping out a fresh series of your favorite series . <br><a name="habracut"></a>

      As you understand, the torrent tracker gives to all others connected to them the IP addresses of all the other participants, as soon as you start downloading it, everyone will know about it, such are the peer-2-peer principles.  So, in order not to get to the radars of right holders, you need to block access to them and from them.  For this, in particular, there are different, constantly updated lists of their IP addresses. <br><br>  In Ubunt, you can put a wonderful firewall (or how to call it?), Specifically for this sharpened: <a href="http://moblock-deb.sourceforge.net/">MoBlock</a> .  It daily updates the list of IP addresses that somehow may be associated with rights holders, and through iptables blocks outgoing and incoming traffic with these addresses. <br><br>  We add the source to <code>/etc/apt/sources.list</code> (hereinafter all the examples for Ubuntu 9.10): <br><pre> <code class="hljs nginx"><span class="hljs-attribute"><span class="hljs-attribute">deb</span></span> http://ppa.launchpad.net/jre-phoenix/ppa/ubuntu karmic main</code> </pre> <br><br>  Put the source key: <br><pre> <code class="hljs objectivec">gpg --keyserver keyserver.ubuntu.com --recv <span class="hljs-number"><span class="hljs-number">9</span></span>C0042C8 gpg --<span class="hljs-keyword"><span class="hljs-keyword">export</span></span> --armor <span class="hljs-number"><span class="hljs-number">9</span></span>C0042C8 | sudo apt-key add -</code> </pre> <br><br>  Updating: <br> <code>sudo apt-get update</code> <br> <br>  And set: <br> <code>sudo aptitude install moblock blockcontrol mobloquer</code> <br> <br>  When installing, a setup dialog will appear: <br><ul><li>  In the list of used sources I will not advise anything, put daws depending on your paranoia.  By default, it can and is quite normally configured, but I highly recommend to see for yourself what exactly you need and what not.  Links to the description of each list are given there.  Later, of course, it will be possible to change the settings, but it is better to understand right away. </li><li>  In the white list of ports that will be open anyway, you can add ports 22 (ssh, if you use it), and 5190 (if you use ICQ. MoBlock by default blocks the AOL network, including the ICQ server) </li><li>  If your local network has a non-standard address list, then write it in the white list </li></ul><br>  After installation, you can start the Internet-&gt; Mobloquer (for monitoring and settings) and your torrent client.  Having meditated on the blocked log, you will understand that the list of everything that people are pumping and distributing has long been stored in the archives of dozens of organizations, the question is only time, we are not interested in anyone yet, but who knows when it will start? </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/92055/">https://habr.com/ru/post/92055/</a></p>
