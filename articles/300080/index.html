      I call this phenomenon Wrath Rage.  This happens when millions of people are offended by something that has spread at incredible speed through television or the Internet.  It may be something significant, but often this is what was captured on someone's iPhone, uploaded to YouTube, published on Facebook pages, told to friends ... <br><br>  It is spreading at an incredible speed, and millions of people are angry with something that they cannot control.  You have become a victim of anger.  I know what I mean. <br><br>  What causes such a phenomenon?  Why is it so provocative and attractive?  The main reason is the instant access we have to all kinds of knowledge and information available to us.  Most of this is beneficial and useful.  But only a part. <br><br>  Search engines use the network in the same way that supermarkets use their tricks for rash purchases. <br><br>  Every day you come to your computer with the intention to influence something.  It captures your attention, you click the mouse, and are already involved in the process.  You run straight in the style of Alice in Wonderland and you fall into a rabbit hole that you never intended to fall into.  And Andy Warhol was right.  Each of us can have our 15 minutes of fame. <br><br>  Stories that cause anger and resentment can be quite seductive, especially if they are attached to the video.  We can observe injustice many times, and this allows us to enjoy our indignation. <br><br>  We have to do something about it!  We tell others about it, send information to our friends via e-mail, send it to Facebook so that everyone can see. <br><br>  At the same time, we feel good, but we have taken steps to put this injustice on public display and enjoy a brief moment of satisfaction.  Passion for anger becomes so convincing that at the click of a finger we become <b>Rosa Parks</b> and someone from <b>Gandhi</b> .  Great, right?  Well, not quite‚Ä¶ <br><br>  However, there are some potentially harmful aspects of using the Internet and television.  Anger and the associated physical and emotional effects are a source of stress for your body and mind.  Here are some facts that illustrate this: <br><ul><li>  Each year, approximately 70% of visits to the primary care doctor in the United States are associated with complaints of rage and anger. </li><li>  Anger doesn't really affect anything.  We feel good, it seems to us that we have achieved something.  But actually it is not. </li><li>  Too much anger can affect our <a href="http://testutor.ru/blog/nauka-o-tom-kak-razvit-duxovnuyu-stojkost-v-rabote-i-v-zhizni/">physical, emotional, and spiritual life</a> .  Physical damage is obvious, as is emotional.  Too much information about injustices leads very spiritual people to doubts about the meaning of life.  How often have you heard from a person something like: ‚ÄúHow can God let this happen?‚Äù The consequences of this impact are very difficult to neutralize on your own. </li><li>  Passion for rage is like a passion for junk food.  We use it, it fills us, but with what?  What kind of nourishment does our mind and spirit get from it?  Although we certainly use it sometimes, we must be careful. </li><li>  Passion for fury of the poet Robert Burns called <b>"the inhumanity of man in relation to man</b> . <b>"</b>  Our children are cyber-dependent.  A lot of rage - on the road, which was not 50-60 years ago, and many of us, being an eyewitness, accept the role of a passer-by.  We are used to get some information for work by clicking on the button.  Many of us live like Walter Mitty, fantasize and identify with people they are not.  Passion for rage can keep us away from real life. </li><li>  Passion for anger also contributes to a lack of personal responsibility, personal participation and the realization of personal capabilities.  And these three things, by the way, are characteristic of a healthy and independent person. </li></ul><br>  What was written above does not mean at all that we should not be justifiably outraged by the injustice in the world.  I'm trying to say that we all need to be careful, in view of the effect that anger has on us and on those we care about.  If you are parents of younger children, think about how your passion for anger can affect them. <br><br><h4>  <font color="#0071c5">If you really care about making the world different, ask yourself <b>what are you really doing to change something</b> .</font>  <font color="#0071c5">You need to know what to do with feelings when you are rightly outraged.</font> </h4><br><blockquote>  Everyone can get angry - it's easy.  But it‚Äôs difficult to be angry with the right person, with the right strength, at the right time, for the right reason and in the right way ... </blockquote><br>  - Aristotle <br><br>  PS We recommend another useful article on the work on yourself - <a href="http://testutor.ru/blog/pyat-sekretov-vospitaniya-sily-voli-ot-agenta-fbr/">Five secrets of willpower education from an FBI agent</a> . <br><br>  The author of the translation is Vyacheslav Davidenko, the founder of the <a href="http://testutor.com/">TESTutor</a> company. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/300080/">https://habr.com/ru/post/300080/</a></p>
