      All would be nothing, let them be, as they say.  If not for the two big and related BUT: <br><br><ol><li>  cases are highly overvalued; </li><li>  cases prevent to understand the topic. </li></ol><br>  Why is that.  Let's get a look. <br><br>  <b>Too good to be true</b> <br><br>  For the most part, case studies are positive, embellished examples.  Companies want to show themselves on the good side, so they cannot give an objective assessment for themselves - but was the decision really successful?  Often, the desired is given for the real, is stretched and beautiful packaging. <br><br>  It is more interesting for me - that this or that company has failed, but this is rarely seen and not under this word. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  <b>Case works once</b> <br><br>  Almost always the case is not applicable for use in any form.  There are several reasons for this: <br><br><ul><li>  the result may not be as good as it is served (see above); </li><li>  the assessment methodology was incorrect (for example, all resources spent were not taken into account); </li><li>  in the long run, it turned out that the decision had more drawbacks than advantages (the company suffered losses, lost market share, etc.); </li><li>  the market has changed (case is outdated); </li><li>  only works in this company (of this scale, for this market, for this organizational structure, etc.) </li><li>  only works for the person / team who implemented it (as a rule). </li></ul><br>  And even if all this did not happen, then ... <br><br>  <b>Case is an example of how NOT to do</b> <br><br>  The vast majority of businesses are unprofitable, and startups fail.  If you are trying to use someone else's case, then you increase your chances of being in this cohort.  This is a simple and clear thought. <br><br>  Moreinis once in <a href="https://www.facebook.com/amoreynis/posts/10153873214096511%3Fpnref%3Dstory">one post</a> wrote about this. <br><br>  <b>False understanding of understanding the topic</b> <br><br>  When someone frantically studies cases (which is typical for marketers, but also happens to managers) they get the feeling that they have become better aware of this topic. <br><br>  In fact, trying ready meals you cannot learn to cook.  The process of obtaining a case is more important than its presentation.  And the process kitchen cannot be told or understood in a case (too many nuances). <br><br>  Distraction from the essence of the problem with cases causes great harm, prevents to fully work out the topic himself, to pass through himself and his experience.  Gives the temptation to smack, hurry, take on faith what he heard and relay further as the truth. <br><br>  I see this constantly in the form of a mass of incompetent people with a superficial look at their field of activity.  And no matter what it is about: development, management, advertising or design. <br><br>  <b>No good at all?</b> <br><br>  Of course, there are some benefits from cases.  You can learn about new tools, terminology, in what direction people dug, to get acquainted with the work of competitors, etc.  But any good, specialized article is much more useful. <br><br>  <b>And what is the alternative?</b> <br><br>  Well work out the topic: to study the theory, get the practice itself, make a lot of mistakes, work out your decision and apply the correct methodology for assessing the result.  Then, perhaps, cases will lose their attractiveness, often will seem just ridiculous. <br><br>  <b>So now, do not read them?</b> <br><br>  Read, listen and watch, but treat them with the foregoing. <br><br>  All good projects! </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/320108/">https://habr.com/ru/post/320108/</a></p>
