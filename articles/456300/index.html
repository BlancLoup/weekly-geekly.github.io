  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Finding zina</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"> - Quiet!  Quiet!  - shouted the chairman, running along the narrow, broken, but asphalted main street of the village of Makarov.  - Yes, so you can calm down!  Mikhalych arrived! <br><br>  But the crowd continued to gallop.  Mass meetings rarely happened in the village, and people frankly missed them.  Even the Day of the Village, which had previously been held on such a scale, had long gone.  Although, is it possible to call an event ‚Äúin a big way‚Äù in a village with one thousand inhabitants? <br><br>  Suddenly, on the road near the crowd, K-700 braked sharply, once famous, the yellow Kirovets, with human-sized wheels.  So abruptly that he swung uncertainly on the mighty front springs, pecking his nose.  The cabin door opened, and a short old man appeared in it, wearing a gray jacket, comfortable sweatpants with three stripes on the sides, wool overlays and wool and old and greasy cap.  Bathing cheeks covered with gray bristles, bushy eyebrows hang down over the eyes, but the eyes of slightly narrowed eyes are firm and confident.

      - Found Zina something?  - shouted bass voice from the crowd. <br><br>  - Yeah.  - turned and shouted grandfather, already going down the stairs.  - Right now I will tell everything, let me catch my breath, Kolyunya drove under fifty. <br><br>  - So I am ... - the same Kolyunya, a tractor driver, leaned out of the cab on the opposite side.  - The people have already gathered, and they will move to the city, expect trouble then ... <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  Mikhalych already stood on the pavement and lit a cigarette.  My hands shook a little, but the long-term habit made itself felt - it happened with the first match, despite the wind.  The crowd approached a little, forming a semicircle, in the center of which was Mikhalych and K-700.  Kolyunya wanted to drive off, but the children were already hanging on the wheels, and there was nothing left but to muffle the engine. <br><br>  - Well, tell me, do not Tom!  - the chairman put her hand on Mikhalych's shoulder and shook her gently.  - Where is Zina?  When will she be back? <br><br>  Mikhalych took a deep breath, took a couple more puffs, threw a long cigarette butt on the ground and rubbed it carefully with his foot.  By his appearance it was already clear whether Zina would return. <br><br>  - Will not come back.  - Mikhalych said shortly and was silent. <br><br>  The crowd was unusually quiet.  The eyes, which were previously directed to Mikhalych, turned to the ground, a tractor, an old general store, a row of stalls, to the back of the head in front.  Nobody wanted to believe. <br><br>  - Wait, Mikhalych ... - the chairman took a step back and looked intently at her grandfather.  ‚ÄúTell me how it was ...‚Äù <br><br>  - Yes, Mikhalych, come on, tell me, do not tomi!  - shouted from the crowd.  ‚ÄúWhat is she doing there in the city?‚Äù  In medicine, or what? <br><br>  - In medicine, yeah.  - Mihalych nodded and reached for the next cigarette.  - I'll tell you now. <br><br>  So I came to the city.  Where to look - the devil knows, but he thought a little - where else could the rural doctor go if not to the hospital?  After all, not a manager?  (Mikhalych said it was the ‚Äúmanager‚Äù, and not the usual ‚Äúmanager‚Äù to us). <br><br>  Well, I think we should go to the clinics.  He started with the district - after all, Zina from the area?  I came, so I walk, I look - I can not find.  They have it there, the poster is hanging, sort of like our doctors - they are not there either.  While the nurse was standing, he was considering, a young nurse came up - this young, beautiful, full, so war paint.  He says - what are you, grandfather, looking at here?  A poster for ten years, hanging, as for the arrival of the governor, then hanged, so only dust and wipe for the New Year. <br><br>  And what, I ask, honey, you haven‚Äôt our doctor here?  Zina's name is.  He says - no, not long ago, I would know - I am sitting on the schedule.  So he left, empty-handed. <br><br>  Then he went to the city hospital.  I thought I would also stand at the poster, maybe someone would help. <br><br>  - Horseradish wait for the city somehow.  - came the voice of Kolyuni from above.  - You will die - they will not fit, even to deceive pockets. <br><br>  - You say it right.  - nodded Mikhalych.  - There is no poster there - the TV is hanging, with the schedule, it means.  And, unfortunately, I left my glasses at home - I‚Äôm just putting them on for the newspaper.  Here I stood, peered until a grandmother of some sort came up.  Girlfriend, I say, help me - I do not see a damn, read me the names of the doctors, then.  Well, she read - there is no Zina there. <br><br>  And what, I ask, is all the doctors here?  No, he says, only those that are accepted today.  She gave advice - go to the information window, they know everything there.  Only this, immediately tune in, they say - will be rude.  Well, I say, Nashto scold me afraid?  And went. <br><br>  I stood in line for half an hour - there were three of us there, but the nurse jumped off somewhere in the window, a goat.  When I returned, I asked if there was any, dear, do you have Zina the doctor here?  She went to yell, about some kind of persdan ... personal ... <br><br>  - Personal Information?  - prompted the chairman. <br><br>  - Yeah, that's it!  - Mihalich was delighted.  - I will not say, he says, even if you burst!  I was about to give up, but I decided to lie - my dear, I say, Zina is my daughter, only I lost her phone, I came to visit, I said she works in the hospital, I run for two days, I can‚Äôt find it.  And this goat in any. <br><br>  I went outside, sat on the bench, lit a cigarette.  Here comes a little peasant, in black uniform, with a patch - like a guard, or something.  And bravo so hooked in my ear something - to smoke, they say, it is impossible here, grandfather, now you will pay a fine.  I could not stand it, I jumped up, I yelled at him - what, they say, you, old fellow, dug in to the old man?  Do, perhaps, nothing more?  Go, work with mine, bend your back to the country, which then will not remember your name, then you will teach me! <br><br>  He already reddened, he began to choke - the devil will understand him, either with fear, or right now, to clear his face.  I grabbed my jacket, and as I did it, I jumped.  I almost pulled the sleeve, Herod.  And this grabbed, does not let go, shakes the sleeve.  Well, right now, said, grandfather, the end will come to you.  Prepare retirement, pay off a fine, or sushi crackers - you go street revenge.  Well, I think Mihalych disappeared. <br><br>  - So I would give him a melon, and that‚Äôs the end of it!  - shouted someone from the crowd.  - If the guard at the hospital is working, so is the dry rash, which means utter! <br><br>  - Well, I thought so!  - continued Mikhalych.  - Why am I, in vain, something served in intelligence?  Though contused, I don‚Äôt get rid of such a fat guy?  Yes, I translated those in the forty-third herd across the front, chained like camels! <br><br>  Well, only I, therefore, adapt myself in his ear, then pick him up, shout from behind - stop!  The guard turned around, let me go - scared, it means.  I look - that goat runs out of the information window.  See, conscience seized.  And to the same place, to lie, as I had just now ‚Äî go, says, Seryozh, further patrol, this is my grandfather, from the village, stupid is he, do not be angry. <br><br>  And this stump is not appeasing - no, he says, the law is the same for everyone, they have come here, you establish your own rules.  Zamete grandfather, how to drink to give.  And I don't care that he is your relative. <br><br>  Well, of course, do not care - says the girl.  You do not care at all, like everyone else - at you.  Senseless you, he says, a piece of something there (honestly, did not hear).  There is a hospital here, doctors, people walk, what for are you even needed here, henchman?  You make your way from morning to evening, you don‚Äôt allow moms to push carriages inside - they aren‚Äôt supposed to, they get wet in the rain.  You yourself are not getting wet, you are hiding inside so that your body cannot be wetted with fat. <br><br>  In general, the girl went.  The guard was already shaking all over, he began to walk to her, to raise his hands - here, I see, the old habit worked.  He did not have time to figure out how he moved his ear, and managed to pick it up before the body splashed down to something ‚Äî well, they took the tongues silently.  I sat on a bench, put a cap on my face ‚Äî it seemed to be sleeping. <br><br>  And the little girl is standing, smiling, not frightened - well done.  Well, you give, I say.  You're lying, and do not blush.  And not afraid - come on, how wake up, run complain?  No, he says, will not run.  He is only bold with old men, but with nurses, until he is sent.  Nothing, do not worry, grandfather, everything will be fine. <br><br>  Smiles, so she sat down next to her, and whispers slowly.  What whispers - I can not understand.  Asked to speak louder - repeated.  No, she says, we have no Zina, checked on the computer.  Go, says grandfather, to the district, maybe there.  Well, I tell her, I was, daughter, in the district, Zina is not there. <br><br>  The little girl became thoughtful, took out the phone, let's poke around there.  I thought I would call where I could be, maybe in Durka, so that they would take me away - but no, she has some kind of card in her phone.  She asked who Zina was by specialization - I say, the village doctor, she treated the whole village, she even cured us from all illnesses, and she pounded her teeth.  She still thought, and says - well, since neither in the district nor in the city there, then, therefore, in the paid. <br><br>  Now I, he says, will teach you.  You're there, grandfather, do not even think about asking for Zina.  They don‚Äôt like the elderly at all - you don‚Äôt have the money, if you come to a paid hospital, then some kind of nonsense.  Say that you want to undergo treatment.  Do you have money? <br><br>  Two thousand, I say, gathered up the whole village, on a trip somewhere.  The little girl squashed, became thoughtful.  Suddenly she jumped up and said - sit down, I am now, and ran to the hospital again.  I lit up again - Che, come, no second guard here?  And this one sits, snuffles, even began to snore, drooling flowed.  I wiped with my hat, so that no one noticed - they would think that it was bad, they will call doctors. <br><br>  Girly was not with a quarter of an hour.  Soon this little-tempered one should wake up - it would be necessary to reel the fishing rods, but, thank God, I ran out, with some kind of piece of paper.  She came up, sat in her jacket pocket and quietly stuck it, says - this, grandfather, is a special direction.  If you give them a paid one, you say that from the clinic, they will read and understand.  It seems like we were treating you here, but did not understand what you are sick with, and we send you to a paid one, and we will pay for the treatment.  They are the main thing - to pay someone.  Just don‚Äôt bluff too much - say that you need an inspection first, and you need treatment only by agreement.  Let first write what was appointed, and, they say, you will think and decide.  Got it? <br><br>  I understand, I say.  Wow, what a good caught.  And it smiles again - oh, it's a pity, I‚Äôm old, such beauty disappears ... Well, thanked, hugged goodbye, yes went.  She stopped - how many, she says, this one will sit?  Another fifteen minutes, and wake up.  Baska's a little buzz, and so - nothing.  Come on, will not complain?  The little girl smiled - do not be afraid, grandfather, will be ashamed, because the old man, forgive me, gave something in your ear.  Silence will be like a fish on the ice. <br><br>  I came, it means, to a paid clinic - it was across the road.  It seems that they settled closer - so that, who was tortured in the queue to sit, he ran to them.  I went - how I got into space!  The walls are white, already glistening, everywhere there are sofas, palm trees are growing, the current that vodka is not poured.  He went to the girl, she looks somehow suspicious - go and think, the door was wrong. <br><br>  And I did, sat down, cross my legs, took a piece of paper out of my pocket, and slap it on the table.  I took it with disgust, with two fingers, with my own eyes I ran - and foolishness disappeared like a hand! <br><br>  Hello, says Foma Kuzmich!  At first I was confused - what it is that she calls me Thomas, for I am Nikifor.  It was only there that the nurse did not know my name when she filled out the paper.  Well, I think, now the passport will ask, and the last intelligence operation of the old Mikhalych will fail! <br><br>  No, I did not ask.  She told me to wait a minute, took the phone, rang somewhere, and soon a little peasant rode up - such a fat one, but polished, in a suit, which means that with a tie, the shoes glitter.  Let's go, says Foma Kuzmich. <br><br>  Well, I got up, let's go.  They came to the office, and there - no couches for you, no scales, no closet with pills.  Oak table stands, leather chairs, carpets on the floor.  I looked at my galoshes, it became so embarrassing.  He took off slowly, and left at the entrance.  The guy sat down at the table, I sat down opposite. <br><br>  Well, he says, what did you report with?  And I look around, I just can not understand - he is a doctor or who?  I think - I ask in the forehead.  What, I say, you specialty, dear? <br><br>  He did not blink - I said, the manager.  I frowned my brows - what, I say, are you talking to me then?  I need a doctor.  Come on, take me to the doctor.  You are a manager, I am a tractor driver, about what sores do we talk to you? <br><br>  And he laughs, it‚Äôs already filled up - you see, I said some utter utter nonsense.  You said, grandfather, have you been in a paid hospital for a long time?  No, I answer, for the first time priper.  Well, the manager says, then listen.  We have different procedures right now - first we need to talk with the manager, and only then with the doctors.  And most likely, with doctors and not have to.  I myself, he says, will talk to them, pick you the right specialist - on the head there, or on the stomach, or nerves - we have all sorts of things. <br><br>  Then it dawned on me: see, the manager - instead of the therapist.  Well, in the district it used to be like this.  What would not hurt - go to the therapist, he will redirect.  Like, where are you from, old shit, you may know, you need a neurologist, or a proctologist, if you have a pain below your back, when you sit in the saddle. <br><br>  I ask directly - what are you, the therapist?  Laughs again - grandfather, he says, you ask a lot of questions, spies, or what?  I'm a fool zakosil - they say, where am I, just old I have not been in hospitals for a long time, I don‚Äôt know how everything is arranged here.  To the doctor would be me. <br><br>  He must have started to get mad, he seemed to be tired of laughing.  Come on, says, tell me what hurts you.  And I‚Äôm giving you a treatment plan, procedures, tests, examinations.  And doctors will do what I write. <br><br>  I am not appealing - how do you, I say, will you write a treatment plan for me if you are not a doctor?  Nesto in your managerial vocational school teach what pills what to treat?  He has already begun to twitch - he says everything is taught there.  The manager is like a wagon.  Wherever he went, he would stand up like a cat everywhere.  It is necessary - the treatment plan will be.  It is necessary - the plan of the project is laid out.  Pripret - functional requirements will write.  There will be such a booze - and an approximate estimate for the construction of the cosmodrome will be. <br><br>  Now, he says, everywhere like that.  The manager removes the task, then transfers to the specialists.  And they perform.  Well, they can, and of course, of course, if absolutely nonsense is written, the manager will correct.  This is said to be a flexible approach.  Like worms, or what? <br><br>  So come on, grandfather, do not hesitate my brain more - tell me what you are ill.  I thought, and decided - I'll start small, I want to figure out what they have here.  I cough, I speak.  The manager wrote something down, looking at me again.  I am silent.  Anything that says?  All - I answer. <br><br>  He sighed a little, thought a little, got up and walked to the door - not the one through which you entered, but on the other side.  He stopped at the door of something, he says - feel like at home, Thomas Kuzmich, if you want to drink - there is water in the breakfast room.  And he went out. <br><br>  And I follow him, mouse, mouse.  Looked out - walking down the corridor, not looking back.  After two doors he stopped, and entered the one on the right.  I ran up, I looked - it is written "Ordinatorskaya."  And next to it is a sofa, and a jar of water, inserted into the top of the krantik ‚Äî well, just like our street sinks.  Only it is necessary not to bottom, but to press in front, so that water flows. <br><br>  I sat down and listened ‚Äî they were neighing like horses in a staffroom room.  Senya, they say you are a jerk.  What does "cough" mean?  Well, dry cough, ali wet?  In the morning, or before bedtime, or at night wakes?  With blood, or snot just fly out?  Senya murmurs something, they say cough is cough, and they are even stronger neigh - they say, if the grandfather is old, then go and cough up the last, and then you braid us with brains.  Senya seems to have asked what to assign, someone responds to him - go, you assign tomography, you are a brilliant seller with us, just to grab the commission.  Especially, if the clinic wears. <br><br>  Well, I think it is necessary to return to the starting position - I ran into the office, closed the door, sat down and sat.  Senya comes - his cheeks fluttered, his eyes running, he sat down in a chair, caught his breath.  He says - a couple of questions came from the specialists to clarify the diagnosis I made.  Cough dry or wet?  And everyone, I say, is wet in the morning, dry in the evening.  Senya asked about the blood - no, I say, he has never been like this. <br><br>  Senya wrote something down, paused Maloho, and gives out: well, everything, Thomas Kuzmich, I figured out a treatment plan.  You need a tomography, a complete blood count, an ultrasound scan of the heart, kidney, and bladder, an x-ray of the teeth, a biopsy, and vitamin tablets, he says, I'll write it out right away.  I have already dropped my jaw - good, my own, but it would have turned out inconveniently. <br><br>  I say, my dear, are you holding me for someone?  Though I am old, I know how to cough.  Vaughn, pills from him for twenty rubles sold.  This is where Senya suffered ... <br><br>  Here, he says, everyone thinks that they know better how to treat sores.  They start with coughing, but intelligent specialists are not asked, and are treated to the point that they cannot take a step.  It is not necessary, he says, to save on health.  Listen to sensible specialists, and if they say that you need an MRI and vitamins, don‚Äôt blather, say, but pay and do. <br><br>  I am not appealing - you say, Senya, excuse me, but at least let me talk to the doctors!  You are in the sores or in the tooth foot!  Even I know more!  Do you want me to say, I will show you where to press the carotid artery so that you can sleep for half an hour?  Senya, you see, struck a little, or decided not to get involved ‚Äî well, he says, I will ask again.  And you, grandfather, clarify something about your cough. <br><br>  I thought for a moment what would have been such a thing, and then it came to me - it must be said so that if Zina is there, she would understand.  I thought, I thought, and I say, Senya, tell them that I am coughing, as if I swallowed shishabarka.  What, asks?  Shishabarka, I speak and nod.  Doctors, they say, will understand.  He shook his fat little shoulders, and again went to the staffroom room, and I followed him. <br><br>  Sat, sat - do not neigh at this time.  I didn‚Äôt hear anything, I even missed Seni‚Äôs return - I had to quickly grab a glass, and as if pouring water.  He stood over me, and asked - listen, grandfather, and you're not from Makarov, by chance?  I nod, they say yes. <br><br>  Come on, says.  Here one of the experts wants to talk to you.  Well, I already knew which.  Zina, of course. <br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">He brought me to a normal, medical office, I saw Zina, so I started to smile, that I almost broke my mouth. But he did not show it - he came in, sat down, I was silent. And Senya sat down next to him. Zina looks at me, smiles softly, then barks at Senya - why are you sitting down? Get out from here! He began to argue, they say he is my manager, and without him you can‚Äôt talk to me, so she quickly rounded him up - a medical secret, he says, no one has yet canceled. Senya was not found, which is to argue with something, and dumped. </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Well, embraced, as expected. Only sad she, some kind. Sat down, talk. She left, she said, because she was tired. There is little flesh in the village - after all, there is no hospital there, it almost worked on a voluntary basis, and for almost forty years. Do not marry - for whom, in the village, then? Alkashnya is one, and who does not drink - everyone is busy.</font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Long, she said, she thought. I wanted to consult with the people, but did not dare - I knew that they would persuade, and she would succumb. That's why she left at night, on a ride, the phone immediately changed, so they did not start calling. </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">I started a tear - Zina, I say, and how are we without you? What should we do? In the city, or what, ride? So here you see how everything is - in the clinic you will not wait, you will die, while they will. And in the paid one - the manager, you pay the salary for the year in order to cure the boil. And you, Zina, drink calendula, and in two days everything will pass. Who in the city knows about calendula?</font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Here and Zina burst into tears. She got up, shut the door to the key - see that Senya did not break in. Understand you me, said Mikhalych. Well, I can not anymore! I understand everything, you are all well in the village, you like it there, you are there, you have roots there, and who is mine? No one. As she arrived, once, by stupidity, still by distribution, I thought - the village, the air, the people are good. Well, let's say, people are good, and they treat me, as in my own, and the air is alive.</font></font> And everything? <br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">After all, I have friends, from the institute of medicine - they are all in the city, half a day in the clinic, so as not to lose touch, and write a dissertation there, and half a day - in a paid one, where they hurt a lot more. All with apartments, with cars, go to the sea regularly. And those in the north, so for two hundred thousand have long been a month. I already choked - the whole village does not receive so much from us. </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">I want, he says, to live normally, in a human way. Finally, as they say. I stopped arguing with her - I began to understand, sort of. I say - what do you get here? Zina smiled, waved her hand, laughs - do not be afraid, Mikhalych, where ours did not disappear.</font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Me here, he says, was appointed chief diagnostician. This, therefore, means that I am able to determine sores faster and better than anyone. Well, of course - in the village, all by eye had to do, even a cold, even a fracture, even a twist of intestines. So it was tricked out, as analyzes are not necessary - especially as there is no opportunity to take them. </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">First worried - here, come, I saw what all? Tomography, ultrasound, specialties nemeryannom - and I'm just a doctor. When applying for a job, even the specialty could not be called a specialty - she was called a therapist, as in a diploma. And how the patients went - I immediately diagnose, even according to the description that Senya brings.</font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Then I could not resist - asked what Senya. He says that this is all complete nonsense, recently invented. The director of their kuda had gone to Moscow, had listened there, and decided that the appointment with the doctor right away was the last century. They say that the doctor is like a child. A man with a cough will come to him, the doctor will prescribe pills and send with God. The patient will only absorb the reception, even the pills will not buy - they say, it is expensive from us. Here are sales and almost none - the director said, ‚Äúwe just sell our time‚Äù. And it is necessary, sort of, to sell more.</font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">And he came up with a manager. That sensible person will not sell only what he needs - he will surely put together the accompanying goods, as he said. He called us, which means programmers, marketers, they set up some kind of program, and wanted to make us drive in all appointments, for all the years, in order to understand to whom what can be delivered. </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">We, of course, became enraged, threatened that we would leave - it cost, we hired students from honey, they almost pounded everything for bread. These marketers have ridiculed, and they made up the signs to us - Zina got out, showed. There, then, wrote a sore, and listed what you can add to it.</font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">And then there are some scarecrow cards, even the doctors were forced to learn them. Like, if you cough, then you need to tell all the diseases in which the entot cough happens. And cancer will come up, and the heart, they say, according to recent studies, can cause coughing. And the main thing - to sell all tomography, as the latest and best achievement of world medicine. In general, Zina said, the thing is really useful, it can find sores, but it hurts dear. And the director of the machine must return the money, so he tries.</font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">But it did not go with the doctors. Well, they can not prescribe tomography, if a person has a cut on his finger, festering or a strawberry rash on his face. That separated the patients from the doctors, put the managers. Senya is the best. Previously, they say, he worked with programmers, he knows this business - after all, there is the same trouble. A good programmer, they say, as a doctor, he knows the treatment faster than the person tells him what happened. That heals, cheaply, and the office has almost no benefit.</font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">On the other hand, says Zina, it's even easier. Many doctors have become stupid before our eyes, and new ones from the institute are happy, like children. You don't need to think anymore, just do it. The manager has appointed a dropper to put - be kind, do not ask questions, smile and stick a needle. Some doctors in general have forgotten how to make a diagnosis, and at least understand something in treatment. Soon they will become like nurses - from the very beginning they have worked like that.</font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Well, many have gone specialization. If before the doctor was there, the surgeon, so he was a surgeon. And he could cut, and the bones could be set, and appendicitis could be determined, and the hernia could be cured without a scalpel. And now - they almost write him a piece of paper, where and what should be cut, how to sew it up later, and what should be rinsed inside, or which instrument should be inserted. Well, like the workers in the shop began, that work on the pipeline - the brain does not use at all. So, that is rotten, the brain is turned off quickly, when it is not that the history of the disease - even the patient can not see. Only plot, in which you manager nose stumbled. </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">I again for my own - they say, if it‚Äôs so bad, let's go to us again! Well, we come up with something with money. I will talk to the chairman, maybe he'll get you more pay, or there, I don‚Äôt know how they will add up to the village doctor. No, not at all.</font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Zina says that she will dig a little more, and wants to open her hospital. Will start with one cabinet, she will take. He says that you are not the only one, Mikhalych, who does not like the local order. Many patients complain that they can not reach the doctors, but they give money, as for repairing the engine. Easier to lie down and die. </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">She found, she said, among like-minded doctors - those that are older, they still remember the Hippocratic Oath, and some unforgettable feeling there - well, when a patient, learning that you only need to drink a pill, so sincerely smiles, as probably only in childhood smiled when he found a gift under the tree. This, says Zina, cannot be replaced with any money.</font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Then I got in again - Zina, they say, we are so smiling at you in the village, you get tired of being surprised! Does not give in. I let out a tear again - I can't, that's all. I want to earn money, and help people, for now kill it. </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Then I realized - Zina, I say, or maybe we will go for treatment to you then? Well, when you open your office. Or maybe you are to us? Once a week there, or how?</font></font> BUT? <br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Looks like she didn‚Äôt think about it - her eyes immediately dried out, smiled, nodded. Similarly, says, Mikhalych! What I did not think! Only this ... I‚Äôm going to treat for money, and you are in the village ... </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Oh, I say, do not be afraid! Well you are now urban, you have neither your potatoes, nor meat, nor Zelenushkas, there is no place to take even a home brew! So we will provide you, Zinul - you know us, we have the freshest, without chemicals, from the garden! No money, so at least feed you, to satiety! Also for sale will remain. </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">No, he says, here I am - I am a doctor, not a trafficker. But thinking is good. Especially if we provide transport, we bring it from the city, a day will heal, and leave with the gifts. I swore to organize everything.</font></font> On that and decided. <br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">We sat a little more, recalled the old, drank tea. Well, he says, you, Mikhalych, have invented about shishabarka. I immediately realized that there was someone from Makarov, and for sure - to me. Where would the money for a paid hospital come from? </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">- Well, then you know. - finished the story Mikhalych. He took another cigarette, lit it, and stared at the clouds floating above the village with a sense of accomplishment. </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">- Well, you, Mikhalych, shishabarka ... - said the chairman with a smile. - Will you go to my deputies? We would have to repair the bridge, agree, go, go to the city, then? </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">- God forbid. - the picture crossed Mikhailovich. - Enough with me. Last time I saved my homeland.</font></font><br><br>  - Well done!<font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Well done, Mikhalych! </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Wow! </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">- there were shouts from the crowd. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">- With me shkalik! </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">I am the first to Zina! </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">But Mikhalych did not listen. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Slowly he made his way past Kirovets, and walked home.</font></font></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/456300/">https://habr.com/ru/post/456300/</a></p>
