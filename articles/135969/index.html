      This is a must read! <br><br>  I myself am one of those arrogant people who love to miss the intro! <br><br>  From the first, second and subsequent views it may seem that this entry contains a set of simple truths.  Unfortunately, it took my brains more than three years to absorb these unpretentious little fad and, discussing this topic with others, I involuntarily noted that some succeeded even less here.  Let's start. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Looking through any resource dedicated to emigration, whether it‚Äôs someone‚Äôs opus or an official source, please don‚Äôt forget that the information may be inaccurate for an astronomically large number of reasons: <br><br>  1. The most banal and obvious is prescription.  Your friend with Toronto can boast about how coolly and quickly he found work in his specialty, while completely forgetting to clarify that this was some 10 years ago.  For some reason, it is very easy for a person to imagine what a world was without an iPad and iPhone, but it will be completely impossible for him to imagine the situation on the employment market even a few years ago, although the latter is changing even more rapidly.  Here, in the IT sector, the following Darwin trends are observed.  Specialists come more and more, jobs because of the recession is becoming less and less.  Employers can choose and pick and choose.  And first of all they choose (descending) acquaintances, specialists with experience with a certain technology (twice the bold type), specialists with local education (master, bachelor, etc.), local talkers with excellent English, certified specialists, Hindus, Chinese, YOU.  Some statistics for the first, second quarters of 2011. Some companies receive 200 resumes for Junior .Net Developer positions. <br><br>  2. The next reason is geography.  I had to live in Vancouver (medium-sized job market) and Victoria (small), Toronto (decent).  Markets differ dramatically.  For example, the proportions of the technologies on which they write, as well as the methods of job search and passing interviews, differ.  For example, in Vancouver, companies like to secretly discriminate against English (2008-2012).  In Toronto, employers are language easier and more businesslike.  In Vancouver, a certain etiquette is adopted, according to which employers simply consider it impolite to deny you employment, so you can expect for quite a long time the very notice of their decision.  Another example of the local feature (all three cities) is that you need to be able to praise yourself.  In the most direct sense.  They expect from you the most exciting stories, how you personally saved the project, and, at the same time, examples of how you know how to work in a team.  Leave the other burning details for later. <br><br>  3. We have too much dust in our eyes.  If you thoroughly approach the issue of emigration, you probably spent a lot of time on the forums.  Have you ever thought that the attitude of success towards failure is suspiciously disproportionate to them?  For the most part, we all love to brag about our achievements and successes; therefore, forums, blogs and newspaper articles are full of stories about the Canadian dream that has come true.  Gloss.  If a friend uploads photos of his own house and several brand new cars, with a 90% chance your friend is in debt like silks.  Think about it, and how much does he have a bet on the house, cars?  Is there anything for the kids to do with not the cheapest higher education here?  And back, we absolutely do not like to wash dirty linen in public.  I doubt that you will find a lot of stories from those who didn't quite make it, which means such people are interrupted by low-paying hard work, fighting to make ends meet. <br><br>  4. There is still your fault.  If you estimate your chances by comparing yourself with another emigrant who is successful here and suppose that items a and b from our list are similar, you can still be incredibly miscalculated.  First, do you have any additional responsibility.  Family, for example.  Family will significantly affect your strategy (long-term plans), tactics (short-term) and lifestyle.  If you are completely lonely and not burdensome by responsibility, you can live practically anywhere, for example, rent a room in the basement (room in a basement), in an apartment that is rented (apartment), somewhere, in a new building (condo), if you're lucky.  You can go to study, on credit or with your own money, if finances allow.  Oh yes, your starting positions, which include age, your savings, work experience, experience of previous business trips abroad, knowledge of foreign languages, cultural and political beliefs - all this will play a role.  If you all had a tip-top at home, this does not mean that it will roll in Canada.  Try to be as objective as possible.  Are you successful now because you are truly a first-class specialist, or did your employer simply have no other choice?  This especially applies to ‚Äúpromising young professionals.‚Äù More often than not, we still have not enough experience to notice such a rake. <br><br>  5. I really didn‚Äôt want to include this item, but without it the list will be ‚Äúhalf empty.‚Äù Throughout the cycle, I will make maximum efforts not to slip into discussing where it is better to live or the reasons why people leave.  But unfortunately, our ideology and views very much affect our perception.  There is, hmm, intellectual color blindness.  I met people who were ready for anything, just to go abroad.  Their distinguishing feature is to idealize local life.  This category also includes students who receive education abroad at the expense of their father and mother.  I also came across people who, on the contrary, cursed Canada.  They are heard the least on the Internet, because very few people want to be known as a loser like this in public.  Please be vigilant when reading colorblind.  If you are one of those who like to judge life abroad by Hollywood movies and TV shows - God help you! <br><br>  PS Since the article is not mine, the answers to the questions will be slightly delayed, I apologize. <br><br>  PPS I did not find an IT blog abroad; </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/135969/">https://habr.com/ru/post/135969/</a></p>
