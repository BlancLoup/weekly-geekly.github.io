  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Epic fail of RSL</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  This post is a small report on a visit to the Russian State Library.  Lenin with all the truth, as it is. <br>  So, on arrival in Moscow, the idea crept in to me that it was worth visiting the RSL. <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  I walked ready for anything and in a positive mood. <br>  I was clearly explained that before visiting the library I have to make a library card.  In the space provided for this, I met an electronic queue, which pleased me.  It turned out that the library card was electronic, with a photograph.  The photo is taken on site by a webcam, issued for 5 years and costs only 100 rubles.  I made it without any problems for an international passport (Russian of course), I was pleased that in this regard, the woman approached the situation adequately.  You can visit the library right away, but for some reason I returned a few days later. <br><br>  When I appeared at the RSL the next time, then, as the holder of a library card, I went to the main entrance.  At the entrance there was a metal detector, which, of course, squeaked on my macbook, but what alerted me: the security guard did not even bother to check, but simply said to pass.  Haha, he knew what a bloody hell awaits me inside. <br>  At the entrance is a wardrobe, but since I was in a light sweatshirt, I decided to go through like this.  But I was detained by the grandmother at the entrance (with another metal detector!) <br>  - What is it you have hanging there? <br>  - Backpack, I have a laptop in it. <br>  - No no, all the sports stuff in the wardrobe. <br>  - Well, it is inconvenient to carry everything. <br>  - Nothing, nothing, we and the girls carry the laptops separately. <br>  Okay, to hell with you, grandma, went to the wardrobe.  I took out the macbook, charging into my pocket - standing in line.  My turn is coming, already another grandma: <br>  - Hey you come here. <br>  - Where? <br>  - Here, inside - you will hang up the backpack. <br>  The question is, why do you even work?

      Well, okay, things passed - let me go.  Before me is a large staircase and a hall with a catalog.  I see electronic terminals, trying to get the information I need on ‚ÄúDigital signal processing‚Äù, but the only thing that the terminal gives me is ‚ÄúRussian History of the late 17th century‚Äù, and I cannot change the query. <br>  I ask the women who are sitting there, working with the terminal. <br>  - Uh, terminals don't work. <br>  -I have a personal computer, can I access the directory information through it? <br>  (minute pause) <br>  -We don't know what you're talking about.  Below there is an electronic catalog - go there. <br><br>  Okay, I went to the basement, to the electronic catalog. <br>  It looks decent, computers stand.  Most of the LCD, although somewhere in the CRT ... <br>  Sit down, look - installed Windows XP, IE6, MS Word (???) and, of course, Kaspersky Anti-Virus. <br>  Everything is terribly slow (it takes 3 minutes to wait for IE to start, and a minute after each click), there is no Internet connection. <br>  I was surprised by the fact of using IE6 as a browser, especially after <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Aurora">Operation Aurora</a> .  And also the use of proprietary software is not clear, though it could be successfully replaced with <u>any</u> Linux graphical system and Open Office. <br>  Although partly understandable, another way to "launder" money. <br><br>  So, I try to find the literature that interests me.  With difficulty of course, but I find.  And then the question arises: "how can I get these books to read." <br>  I‚Äôm not a stupid person, but I couldn‚Äôt figure it out, so I went to the girl who runs the hall.  She explained to me that I can order books from the catalog electronically, or, if they are before 1999, then only by paper request.  Well, I decided to try out an e-mail request, because the necessary books were quite fresh. <br>  This, to be honest, was the last straw of my patience, since the answer to my request was ‚Äúyour book will be issued to you at 15.10 of the NEXT DAY.‚Äù <br>  ‚ÄúOh, to hell with you,‚Äù I think I'll go sit somewhere with the Internet, read from my computer, write another coursework.  I ask whether it is possible to sit down somewhere and connect to the Internet via wifi, from my point of view in the 21st century this is quite normal ... <br>  The answer was: "And we everywhere have access to the Internet for a fee, and if you don‚Äôt order a book, go away" <br>  I think about myself ‚Äúgo with your library to the forest‚Äù and leave. <br>  Trying to get out <br>  - And you did not fill in the leaf ... (this is the so-called ‚Äúmustard plaster‚Äù who knows) <br>  - So I did not take anything <br>  -Well, we still have to fill out without it. <br><br>  This is what I don‚Äôt understand in this situation: why issue cards if you don‚Äôt enjoy their benefits?  Using a card and a single database, you can tell who I am, when I came, where I went, what I took, when I took it, etc.  So do not, let's use these old "Soviet mustard plaster". <br>  Filling out a piece of paper, I finally broke out of this hellish library. <br><br>  At the exit, I saw a girl with whom I came in, and who, apparently, also could not stand the ‚Äútest‚Äù of the library. <br><br>  In my opinion, this is real epic fail of the RSL, otherwise you can‚Äôt tell. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/89482/">https://habr.com/ru/post/89482/</a></p>
