In the summer of 2014, our <b>Brainy Studio</b> team found itself in the finals of the international <b>Imagine Cup competition</b> , where we represented Russia in the Games nomination with our <b>TurnOn</b> project.  We managed to take first place, win the main prize of $ 50,000, and also receive 20,000 euros for the development of our startup in the additional competition <b>AppCampus Award</b> . <br><br><iframe src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://player.vimeo.com/video/120879849&amp;xid=17259,15700023,15700186,15700191,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhjA2nRd3NHqz8X44ZUuv9KFFAqXdg" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0" title="Imagine Cup 2014 - Brainy Studio - Trailer VFX" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  If interested - go under habrakat, there are still many beautiful videos! <a name="habracut"></a>

      We have written a lot of publications from <a href="http://www.kp.ru/daily/26263/3142028/">Komsomolskaya Pravda</a> to <a href="http://www.lookatme.ru/mag/live/direct-speech/206510-brainy-studio">Look At Me</a> .  Even there was a special page <a href="http://events.techdays.ru/ImagineCup-2015/history">"Brainy Studio: Instructions for a Dream"</a> on the site <a href="http://www.imaginecup.com/">Imagine Cup</a> .  And it was great!  However, we would like to write our own history and share with you the complete material, how it all happened with our eyes, how these 10 unforgettable days passed in Seattle (USA) in the homeland of Microsoft. <br><br>  We hope that this article will be useful to all those who are participating or planning to participate in the Imagine Cup.  We also hope that this material can inspire those who did not succeed in the first time - because we won the Imagine Cup the second time, and the AppCampus Award in the third. <br><br>  As mentioned above, for us this was the second attempt to participate in the Imagine Cup - the first participation was in 2013: in April we reached the Russian final, where we took the second place.  After that, it took us another half a year to finally release our first game <a href="http://bit.ly/witchcraft_wp_rus">WitchCraft</a> at the end of October 2013, which was made absolutely free and without advertising on the Windows Phone platform. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/e76/0d0/710/e760d0710238910cbc60ef0d32d6b1a0.png" alt="image"><br>  After the first release within 3 months, we were engaged in the development of the continuation of <b>WitchCraft 2</b> - on the new for us Unity 3D engine.  But soon came the awareness of the fatigue of the setting and the understanding that with a small team we are not ready for a quick transition from 2D to full 3D.  And by the end of 2013, it was decided to freeze the project for a while. <br><br>  After the 2014 New Year holidays, our artist Ilya at one of the meetings shared an idea for the next project: "It should be an atmospheric game about a small electric spark that lights up the light in the city."  Having discussed the main points, we agreed with the concept and began to develop the idea further. <br><br>  The first tasks were the design of the design document and the assembly of the prototype of the game.  Two weeks later, we learned about the start of the <a href="http://gamesjam.org/">Games Jam Kanobu</a> contest, and this contest turned out to be an excellent test of the viability of the game. <br><br>  At that time, there was not even confidence that by the end of the competition we would be able to collect at least a small prototype of the game.  But over the month of development, we worked in detail on a design document and <a href="http://gamesjam.org/369/">rolled out a</a> working demo version of the game with two levels.  As a result, we received excellent feedback and comments on the project - most appreciated the concept, the atmosphere and the proposed gameplay.  This gave an additional charge of motivation and desire to continue to do the project. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/ee5/783/c5b/ee5783c5bf5a11d351dfc0b62445ec9e.png" alt="image"><br><br>  Moreover, <b>in the ‚ÄúRealization‚Äù nomination</b> we unexpectedly <a href="http://blog.gamesjam.org/post/80578582697/gamesjamkanobu">took the 3rd place</a> and received a free license of Unity Pro, tickets to participate in <a href="http://devgamm.com/moscow2015/">the DevGamm conference</a> and 30,000 rubles, for which we later went <a href="http://blog.devgamm.com/ru/2014/devgamm-moscow-official-report/">to this exhibition</a> to show our project. <br><br>  Naturally, in February 2014 they decided to try a <b>second time to apply</b> for the Imagine Cup competition with TurnOn and began to work hard on the game, so that over time it would become more than just a two-level prototype.  As time went on, the game grew, we added new content, checked the gameplay, tested and reworked it. <br><br>  <b>The regional final of the Imagine Cup</b> in Perm was very easy for us.  We showed a good level of preparedness of the project, and already in April we were at the Russian final of the competition, where we also won first place.  Video about how the <b>Russian final</b> passed: <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/ISb5eMUvI0M%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700023,15700186,15700191,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhhi0-F0jIMPcok_Rgbo1EVaWC1pFg" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  Following the results <b>, 3 projects of the winner</b> in each category <b>were selected</b> : <i>‚ÄúGames‚Äù, ‚ÄúInnovations‚Äù and ‚ÄúSocial Projects‚Äù</i> .  For a month, it was necessary to take into account the comments, rework the project and all materials into English, and also record a 10-minute video of the presentation entirely in English in one duplicate.  After that they had to choose only one team, which will represent the country at the international final.  And <b>on June 6, 2014 we</b> received a letter that we were chosen from three teams and in 2 months we will go to the international final of the Imagine Cup in the USA. <br><br>  Two months of preparation passed very quickly and during this time we had a lot of time: <br><ul><li>  Finalize the project, add several new levels and implement clear learning. </li><li>  Adapt levels and realize virtual reality support not only for Oculus Rift glasses, but also on mobile devices running Windows Phone </li><li>  Put a full demo version in public access </li><li>  Prepare for the exhibition of projects, make handouts and prepare versions of the game for different devices </li><li>  And most importantly, to work out and rehearse a presentation in English to automatism. </li></ul><br>  And so <b>on July 24, 2014,</b> our journey to America began: <br><br><iframe src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://player.vimeo.com/video/103574467&amp;xid=17259,15700023,15700186,15700191,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhiLXWT8x8TGy9TMAxhBNqDiVV8qoQ" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0" title="Imagine Cup 2014 - Brainy Studio - Day 0-1" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  We were very lucky when we asked Microsoft to make a flight to the USA 5 days before the competition at the time of booking a plane ticket, so that we had time to acclimatize and have time to see the city and the sights outside the main and very rich Imagine Cup program. <br><br>  The only thing was to independently find a hostel where to live and choose how to spend this free time.  This question was resolved in advance: while the whole team was finalizing the game and preparing for the presentation, our mentor Anton spent some time to plan the trip and we knew in advance where we wanted to go and what to see. <br><br><iframe src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://player.vimeo.com/video/104238666&amp;xid=17259,15700023,15700186,15700191,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhhtoZM6XXgDh4aDbfgUE5dhifnFQg" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0" title="Imagine Cup 2014 - Brainy Studio - Day 2" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  The next day, from so many walks around Seattle, everyone had sore feet, but it was impossible to give up, because  on the third day, it was planned to visit the famous <a href="http://www.museumofflight.org/">Museum of Flight</a> - Aviation Museum, located on the territory where famous Boing planes are assembled. <br><br><iframe src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://player.vimeo.com/video/120038198&amp;xid=17259,15700023,15700186,15700191,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhhwOe58jHx7VeSvcS_AqHyBNX9p4A" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0" title="Imagine Cup 2014 - Brainy Studio - Day 3" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  On the fourth day of the trip, we had a meeting with our acquaintance <i>Michelle Fleming</i> , who until recently led the program of <a href="http://www.microsoftstudentpartners.com/">Microsoft partner students</a> - she promised to take us on Facebook in June to take an unusual tour of the underground city. <br><br>  And after the excursion we planned to go to the Bellevue area in order to find the headquarters of <b>Valve</b> , try to get there on the excursion and maybe buy souvenirs that were left from the past a week ago by <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_International_2014">The International 4</a> . <br><br><iframe src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://player.vimeo.com/video/120038238&amp;xid=17259,15700023,15700186,15700191,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhh8_xidM2LjZI79L-zJcP1NM3mvig" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0" title="Imagine Cup 2014 - Brainy Studio - Day 4" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  Every day we were attracted by the famous <b>Mount Rainier</b> , which was visible from all parts of the city.
