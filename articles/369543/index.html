The site had two articles describing the coolest IT museums in the world.  <a href="https://geektimes.ru/company/airbnb/blog/251542/">Part 1</a> and <a href="https://geektimes.ru/company/airbnb/blog/251634/">Part 2</a> , but the museum, about which I want to tell, was not included in this list.  One of the reasons, perhaps, is that it is very difficult to get to him. <br><br>  So, welcome, <b>Nexon Computer Museum</b> . <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/fe5/982/d46/fe5982d46fa547ada8690575e3d21e5d.jpg" alt="image">

      The title photo is not mine, taken <a href="https://jejutourism.wordpress.com/2015/12/28/nexon-computer-museum-in-jeju/">here</a> , since I arrived in the morning and the sun was shining just in the face. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Jeju Island is located southwest of mainland Korea.  Everything speaks about its volcanic origin, including the decoration of the streets, which is made of volcanic rock. <br><br>  Under the spoiler, some travel notes and some information about the island itself, who are not interested - you can skip <br><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Travel Notes on Jeju Island</b> <div class="spoiler_text"> The road to the island is very difficult, the fastest way is a plane, an international airport is located on the island, flight intensity is every 5 minutes, but 4 days before the trip there were no tickets there, so I had to choose a longer but more interesting way. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/c81/fe5/15f/c81fe515f11746e582a0673089faf115.jpg"><br><br>  I was traveling from the city of <b>Gumi</b> , getting up at 5:30 in the morning, 7 km to the bus station, the bus I needed to go to <b>Gwangju</b> leaves at 7:30.  There is a transfer to another bus to the port city of <b>Wando</b> , and from there a ferry to <b>Jeju</b> .  The ferry ticket was bought in advance, and I took the bus tickets directly at the stations. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/ae2/95e/337/ae295e337de341f9a3959072eb69d929.jpg"><br><br>  The buses are very comfortable, they drive about 90 km / h, all the seats are equipped with safety goggles, there is air conditioning and a charging port near each seat.  The road to <b>Gwangju</b> took 2:50 with one stop for 20 minutes.  From <b>Gwangju</b> to <b>Wando</b> another 2:10. <br>  Great views opened along the way. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/1fa/fa3/407/1fafa3407fb84e86bddebf1de9d6074d.jpg"><br><br>  I arrived in <b>Wando</b> at 13:20, the ferry departed at 15:00, so I walked from the bus station to the terminal, looked at the town. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/6c4/f83/a85/6c4f83a8541245c38e63ce3fd888f717.jpg"><br><br>  The ferry is rather not even a ferry, but a high-speed cargo catamaran, called <b>Blue Narae</b> , technical information about the ship is available on the old-school Finnish <a href="http://www.matkustajalaivat.com/Ferries/HanilBlueNarae1993/etusivu.htm">website.</a> <br>  It looks very cool, it goes briskly, the whole journey took 1 hour and 40 minutes. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/952/354/ba4/952354ba4f524adb832927571b9f5264.jpg"><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/35d/961/10b/35d96110bcda45dfb73e3b56c716afef.jpg"><br><br>  Despite the fact that the ticket indicated the seat in the cabin of the vessel, I spent the whole way on the deck with a jar of beer and squid)) <br>  In the port of the island were already two pleasure boats and a huge cruise liner. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/b04/338/839/b04338839fa847d0b3a86d741e5cd8af.jpg"><br><br>  Arrived on the island closer to 5 pm, I booked <a href="http://www.booking.com/hotel/kr/r-amp-guesthouse-jeju-city.html">Jeju R Hotel &amp; Guesthouse</a> for the night.  For my money just a gorgeous place, and even breakfast was included in the price. <br><br>  The next morning went to the Nexon Museum.  I also managed to visit a couple of interesting museums, a botanical garden and went to the beach. <br><br>  In the opposite direction, it was possible to take a plane ticket, also with a 50% discount, some kind of a share of the airline.  Departure was at 22:10 to the city of <b>Daego</b> .  In a straight line to it, only 330 km away, I thought there would be some kind of propeller aircraft, so when I saw the Boeing 737-800, to say the least, I was surprised.  When I checked in, I was in for an unpleasant surprise, you cannot take a crib on board, I had to take the rucksack in my luggage, and the flight was delayed for 25 minutes; <br><br>  40 kilometers remained to <b>Gumi</b> , city buses at that time no longer run, and it didn‚Äôt offer anything sensible to intercity Google either.  The prospect of spending the night in Tegu (so this city is read) or going by taxi to Gumi was not at all pleasing.  Having seen the railway station on the map, I decided to walk to it, at the same time to see the night city.  I arrived in half an hour and was pleasantly surprised that in 15 minutes there was a train to Gumi.  At 01:20 I was already in Gumi, the last spurt remained - 7 km to the hotel. <br><br>  The price for a taxi in the evening is not particularly joyful, and the people were getting out of the train decently, I had the idea to ask if someone else could go in my direction and take a taxi for two.  The first comrade did not understand English, but he was lucky with the second boy, it turned out that he and his two other friends had to go exactly there.  We took a taxi, we are going, the guys are still students, they know English quite well (which, unfortunately, is a rarity in Korea), while they were driving, they asked who they were and where I was from.  As a result, he offered them a third of the amount for a taxi, they refused, I did not strongly insist. <br><br>  Closer to two nights, tired but pleased, got to the hotel. <br>  Here is a trip. <br><br>  <u>Total travel budget:</u> <br>  Taxi to the bus station (half way, I really walked in the morning) - 4500 KRW <br>  Bus ticket to Gwangju - 21300 KRW <br>  Bus ticket to Wando - 16500 KRW <br>  Jeju Ferry Ticket - 37000 KRW <br>  Hostel - 22000 KRW <br>  Flight ticket to Daego - 45000 KRW <br>  Train ticket to Gumi - 3200 KRW <br>  Taxi to the hotel - Free (it would be about 9000 KRW) <br>  About 9000 more I spent on trips around the island <br>  Total out about 160,000 KRW, which is about $ 145.  In general, the road by plane to Jeju without discounts would be a little more expensive than buses + ferry, but much faster, so I would recommend just such an option. <br><br>  Entrance fees to museums, food, souvenirs were paid separately. <br>  The symbol of the island is considered such stone statues, in the form of which they sell magnets, chocolate and much more. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/e47/0a1/295/e470a129505d41ce827c966b1721f7d1.jpg"><br><br>  On this perhaps everything, under a spoiler, a separate article turned out :) It's time to move on to the description of the museum. <br></div></div><br>  The museum opened on July 27, 2013, and last week celebrated its third anniversary.  As the name implies, it contains his company <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nexon">Nexon</a> , known primarily by the fact that it released the first online MMORPG back in 1996.  The museum is located in a separate 4-storey building with a total area of ‚Äã‚Äãabout 2500 square meters.  The museum is open from 10 to 18 all days except Monday.  The entrance ticket costs 8,000 KRW (about $ 7.5). <br><br>  On the ground floor there is a hall that tells the general history of computer technology.  The photo was made on the phone, the lighting in the halls is not very bright, so I strongly ask you not to judge. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/589/0f2/7c9/5890f27c94b847178cd44e52d025f513.jpg"><br>  <i>Prototype computer mouse</i> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/f34/25d/f9a/f3425df9aae442098ff377fee3ed4a4a.jpg"><br>  <i>IBM Electronic Typewriter 1959</i> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/843/30f/880/84330f880b654952bad2705ecc7c849f.jpg"><br>  <i>This is a miracle of technology - also a typewriter <b>IBM WheelWriter 70 Series II</b> 1988 year</i> <br><br>  The undoubted pride of the museum is the <b>Apple I</b> motherboard.
