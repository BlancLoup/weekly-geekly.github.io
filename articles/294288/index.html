  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Dashboard24 panel: go to the instruments</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Russians are buying on the Internet more and more, and almost all categories of goods.  According to a survey by <a href="https://yandex.ru/company/researches/2015/ya_commerce">Yandex.Market,</a> consumers combine purchases in Russian and foreign online stores, and Russian stores are included in a set of sites for electronic shopping from 90% of respondents.  Currency fluctuations and price changes lead to a wave-like demand, buyers react to both price and non-price factors.  It is not surprising that many entrepreneurs seek to build their online business - online stores are experiencing a period of intensive development.  However, as the sad experience shows, many owners of such sites do not consider even the most basic indicators, which could help to better understand the business and take timely measures in case of a decrease in demand.  Huge advertising budgets are spent on product promotion, but many forget that advertising without analysis is a waste of money. <br><br> <a href="http://megamozg.ru/company/realweb/blog/19176/"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/828/5f4/c24/8285f4c248c6426f9a665a1a10545cb6.jpg"></a> <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  A couple of years ago, Google presented a novelty to advertisers and advertising agencies for managing e-commerce - Google Merchant Center.  This is a service that allows merchants to publish information about their stores and products in Google Shopping and other Google services.  It integrates with Google AdWords and Analytics - so the advertiser can collect the most accurate data about purchases made using online promotion channels.  Not far behind the foreign competitor and Yandex, restarting Yandex.Market.  And again, search giants have fallen into a trend - the growing sector of Internet commerce requires effective and accurate measurements, on which the whole further promotion strategy should be based. <br><br>  If the advertiser‚Äôs store has many names, and contextual advertising is given in separate sources, there is a need for information aggregation and analysis.  Experience with Google Analytics showed <b><a href="http://www.realweb.ru/">RealWeb</a></b> employees that the tool is insufficient, and loading data from other systems is time consuming.  Moreover, one more fact did not suit - the linking of all indicators of contextual advertising to the keyword (keyword), and not to the product.  Neither RealWeb nor our clients were satisfied with this situation and it was decided to develop their own tool for monitoring e-commerce indicators.

    <h2>  <font color="#0d75bb">Dashboard for e-commerce</font> </h2><br>  So <b><a href="http://dashboard24.ru/">Dashboard24</a></b> appeared.  The main difference from <s>dances with a tambourine</s> in Google Analytics was the use of reference books on products that translate information from UTM into a product.  The Dashboard24 system takes data from an xml feed (usually based on the Yandex.Market yml feed).  And this is a significant advantage - the advertising agency gets access only to directories and analytics.  At the same time, there is no need for complex integrations through the API of the CRM system, especially since most major online stores have the information in CRM strictly confidential and no one will allow access to the system to the service advertising agency. <br><br>  In the panel, the client can receive operational reports on Internet commerce in several sections: expense, income, dynamics of advertising costs, the number of orders and the average cost of one order.  Reports can be built by campaigns, region, advertising systems, brands, products and so on ... Yandex Direct, Yandex.Market, Google AdWords are the source of information for building reports.  The income data is loaded from Google Analytics, and the income itself is calculated as the sum of the prices of the goods - that is, as gross income (not to be confused with the profit!). <br><br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/199/490/173/199490173ce14fdd86ca2142e3cb26f1.JPG"></a> <br><br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/f7d/efa/ab5/f7defaab5e914092b642064bffb1302e.JPG"></a> <br><br>  <b><a href="http://dashboard24.ru/">Dashboard24</a></b> is a fairly simple but vital tool for an online store.  It allows you to permanently monitor the dynamics of sales of goods through the three most popular services and gives users good opportunities. <br><br><ul><li>  The ability to quickly report on the effectiveness of specific campaigns, product categories, brands or individual products.  Just go to the panel, select the necessary settings - and you will see the state of affairs for any period.  Such efficiency is justified for any online store, especially during promotions and sales. <br><br></li><li>  Daily monitoring of key performance indicators (DDR). The DDR indicator is the share of advertising expenses that shows the ratio of costs and money that the advertiser received.  In Russian advertising practice, this is a popular indicator, along with ROI.  <i>DRR = total advertising costs / profits derived from advertising costs * 100%.</i>  The lower the DDR, the more effective the campaign. <br><br></li><li>  The ability to easily search for effective and inefficient segments (systems, regions, types of campaigns, campaigns, product categories, brands, products).  Electronic commerce, like any other, is subject to the influence of fashion, seasonality, level of technological development and so on ... These factors are due to an intensive change in the range - some of the products are no longer in demand.  A delayed reaction to a decrease in consumer interest in certain positions can lead to catastrophic consequences: overstocking of warehouses, surpluses and loss of profits. </li></ul><br>  Armed means forewarned.  The use of such dashboards helps to avoid loss of profits, reallocate advertising costs in time and preserve the profitability of the online store. <br><br><h2>  <font color="#0d75bb">Do you need it?</font> </h2><br>  A number of websites and online stores can do with the usual e-commerce tools, but <b>there are conditions under which it is almost impossible to do without the operational panel</b> : <br><br><ul><li>  the presence in the assortment of the store a large number of item positions <br><br></li><li>  availability of goods of various kinds (for example, you sell books, electronics, toys, and interior goods) <br><br></li><li>  the activity of the online store extends to several regions - it is necessary to monitor the dynamics of sales in each region, since demand and purchasing power may differ significantly <br><br></li><li>  online store and tons of contextual advertising and working with Yandex.Market <br><br></li><li>  the owners of the Internet manasin have not exact confidence, which advertising brings the greatest income <br><br></li><li>  Owners are interested in DDR and profitability, but not in the number of clicks on successfully written ads. </li></ul><br>  In addition, there are a <b>number of technical requirements</b> , without which the use of the Dashboard24 service is impossible. <br><br><ul><li>  There must be a description of the goods in the form of updated XML files in YML format (Yandex.Market format). <br><br></li><li>  A Google Analytics account with access rights is required. <br><br></li><li>  The presence of an active campaign in Yandex Direct and / or Yandex Market and / or Google Adwords - the main sources of information for the work of the panel. <br><br></li><li>  The presence of a special structure UTM tags in campaigns or the willingness to change them. <br><br></li><li>  You must be a client of RealWeb - the agency helps to set up the system and put down UTM tags.  It is no coincidence that we are writing about this requirement openly - setting up Dashboard24 requires precise skills and knowledge.  If the data is loaded into the panel incorrectly, then their further interpretation will be useless or even harm, giving the wrong input to make further decisions. </li></ul><br>  If you have an online store or you are only planning to create one, be sure to take time to design an analytics system ‚Äî select in advance the tools that will allow you to manage sales and build a sound development strategy.  Simple online trading with a quick start and working on the principle of "threw money on Direct - got a lot of orders" is a thing of the past.  Today, the one who knows how to think two moves ahead wins.  And without high-quality and comprehensive analytics, this is impossible. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/294288/">https://habr.com/ru/post/294288/</a></p>
