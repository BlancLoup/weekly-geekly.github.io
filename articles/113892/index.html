  <section class="page js-page"><h1>"Samsung: We do not trust our customers!"</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Just over a year ago, I bought a Samsung 22 "monitor. It worked fine for a year, and there were no complaints about it. But a few weeks ago, a ripple appeared on the monitor. Vertical stripes several centimeters wide appeared on the monitor every five centimeters, and all black text on a white background that fell on these stripes was displayed with ripples. <br><br>  Because  Samsung gives a guarantee on its products for 3 years, I was not upset and called the service center, where I was told that they would quickly fix it.  (Before going to the service, I googled and found out that such a problem is often found in Samsung monitors after a year of operation, and all customers who show a defect change the matrix).  But then the long story begins ... <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  Having selected the Corso authorized service center conveniently located on the Samsung website, I handed it over for repair.  More than a week my monitor was repaired.  When I arrived to pick it up, I was told that the master had been testing it for a long time but could not notice the defect ... At the same time, the employee showed me the monitor's "good condition" in the picture of something like this: 
      <br>

    <img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/d2121c8c/2b215f0b/f1e8ab29/2a44909c.jpg"><br><br>  At my request to include some kind of text editor on a white background, I was denied in boorish form and in raised voices ... <br><br>  Because  I did not like this result of the repair, I began to refuse to take the monitor in this condition.  After much debate, I decided to call the samsung hotline. <br>  Having dialed the number, I told the employee about the whole problem that had arisen and asked me to help.  After listening to my story, an employee of the samsung hotline said that: "we trust ONLY our authorized service centers, and if they say that the equipment is working properly, then it is working properly."  With this phrase, I was frankly shocked ... To the question what to do next with an out of order monitor, I was answered that I could contact another service center, or conduct an independent examination ... <br><br>  Without hesitation, I took the monitor from this service center, and the next day I took it to another Samsung plaza service center.  After telling the admissions officer about the problem, the monitor was accepted for repair and I waited. <br><br>  A week later I received an SMS stating that the repair was completed.  The next day I went to the service center, where I again found out that the defect was not found, and at the same time they demanded that I pay for the monitor diagnostics.  (although when putting the monitor in for repair, I specifically asked if I would have to pay for something, and the employee said no to me, only asked to bring a sales receipt when issuing the monitor so that the employee could make sure that the warranty period had not expired).  To my question, on the basis of which I have to pay the cost of diagnostics, I was shown a line in a paper signed by me, which said: "The client is obliged to pay for diagnostics services in case the fact of violation of operating rules and removal of the monitor from warranty service was detected."  It was written to my natural question, where in the report on the result of the diagnosis that a violation of the rules of operation was discovered - the employee could not answer ... <br><br>  Then I again decided to call the samsung hotline, and again telling the story, they again answered me with the phrase: ‚Äúwe trust ONLY our authorized service centers, and if they say that the equipment is working properly, then it is OK‚Äù ... Realizing that to achieve something from samsunga by the phone is not possible, I paid the cost of diagnostics and took the monitor. <br><br>  We must pay tribute to the employee of the receiving department, that our entire dispute was very well and culturally organized, unlike communication with the employee of the Corso service center. <br><br>  When I arrived home, I wrote a letter as advised by a member of the admissions department, to the customer service department, and after a couple of days I was refunded the money I paid for the diagnosis (many thanks to Eugenia for helping me solve the problem).  At the same time I attached a photo taken by a camera from the monitor screen, <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/5a3e67df/0df6fa7a/15d587ba/f07beaf8.jpg"><br><br>  where you can clearly see how the letters began to float, and understand what the letter ‚Äúi‚Äù or ‚Äúl‚Äù is and how many of them are simply not possible ... Previously, the letters were separated by white pixels, and now everything is merging. <br><br>  As a result, having understood that I don‚Äôt have time and desire to carry a monitor through service centers, I bought myself a new monitor.  But I don‚Äôt know what to do with it ... or rather, I know that I have to go to court, but I don‚Äôt have time for that ... <br><br>  I know that there is a Samsung blog on Habr√© and there are company representatives here, maybe you can help solve this problem? <br><br>  Considering that recently I have acquired a lot of samsung equipment, I am afraid that in the event of the failure of any other technology, I will face again the non-professionalism of the service center staff.  Therefore, I decided to prepare in the next couple of days a letter with a story about the quality of work of the Samsung representative office in Russia with clients, and send it to the main office in Korea. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/113892/">https://habr.com/ru/post/113892/</a></p>
