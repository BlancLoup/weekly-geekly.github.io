Together we solve the issues of compatibility of their game engines and development tools with the software of our tablet.  Electronic Arts has already released versions of Need for Speed ‚Äã‚ÄãUndercover and Tetris, which are included with the PlayBook. <br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/76uizw41Nww%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700021,15700186,15700190,15700253,15700256,15700259&amp;usg=ALkJrhgbpik9aVlEUR3qRVNoiYR5KplUdg" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>

      <b>Q: What makes the PlayBook different from other tablets in terms of game developers?</b> <br>  We offer a wide range of application development tools.  Through the use of emulators (App players) on the tablet, you can run applications created using BlackBerry Java or for the Android 2.3 operating system.  Having HTML5 and Adobe AIR support also helps developers create interesting new applications.  And since the BlackBerry Tablet OS operating system is based on QNX, it already has built-in support for WebKit and Adobe Flash, so developers can use web technologies to create applications. <br><br>  In addition to the tools described above, a beta version of the BlackBerry Tablet OS Native Development Kit application development environment will be released this summer.  With it, developers can create high-performance, multi-threaded C ++ based applications using standard GNU toolchains.  Thanks to the hardware accelerated graphics and libraries OpenGL ES 2.0, it becomes possible to develop applications for the tablet using two-dimensional and three-dimensional graphics with special effects based on programmable shaders. <br><br>  It is important to us that developers have powerful and flexible tools, whatever technology they choose - HTML5, Java, Adobe Flash, Adobe AIR or C / C ++.  In addition to the development tools themselves, we will continue to work on improving the API, with which developers can integrate their applications with proprietary BlackBerry functions and services (the so-called ‚Äúsuper-applications‚Äù).  We plan to offer our customers and developers a wide range of cloud services, including BlackBerry payment and advertising systems, services using location information, analytic applications and powerful push-notification services. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  <b>Q: How much work awaits developers who want to adapt previously created games from other platforms to the PlayBook?</b> <br>  Game developers for BlackBerry or Android platforms will be able to quickly and quickly port their applications to run under the BlackBerry Tablet OS, thanks to the high level of API compatibility.  You just need to repack the application, sign the source code and submit the application for review in the BlackBerry App World.  After receiving approval, the app will appear in the BlackBerry App World. <br><br>  <b>Q: It is known that the PlayBook supports Adobe Flash.</b>  <b>Does RIM cooperate with Flash game development?</b> <br>  Of course.  Even in the early stages of creating the BlackBerry PlayBook, we began to work with Adobe.  Using the BlackBerry Tablet OS SDK for Adobe Air, developers can easily create new or port to previously created AIR-based applications to run on the PlayBook.  The BlackBerry Tablet OS SDK for Adobe AIR allows you to create fully-functional and optimized AIR / Flash-based applications for the new BlackBerry PlayBook tablet. <br><br>  <b>Q: Is it to be expected that the BlackBerry Playbook will be available outside of North America?</b> <br>  The start date of sales in the UK (June 16) has already been announced, and in the next stage we will launch sales in other countries of Europe and the world. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/120092/">https://habr.com/ru/post/120092/</a></p>
