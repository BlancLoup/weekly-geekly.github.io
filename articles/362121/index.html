Not so cool, but no longer a movie.  But forget for the next couple of decades about the possibility of getting to that office.  The soaring board from Hendo is first and foremost an eye-catching demonstration of technology that is meant to change the world. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/af7/829/946/af7829946e8c436abeab07ba0435e819.jpg"><br><br>  Showing a visual use of the system for hovering above the ground, Hover seems to have fallen in love with all fans of the Robert Zemeckis trilogy and successfully launched a <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/142464853/hendo-hoverboards-worlds-first-real-hoverboard">campaign on Kickstarter</a> , as a result of which they plan to receive at least $ 250,000. <a name="habracut"></a>

Arx Pax, which is the parent company of Hendo, is responsible for developing the MFA (magnetic field architecture) technology. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/386/541/a50/386541a50e0e4bc3972612b3a6d0d80b.jpg"><br><br>  In order to be one of the first to assess the capabilities of the MFA and even try to implement its ideas on its basis, it is not necessary to send $ 10,000 to the Hover account (this is how much it takes to get one of the ten prototype boards).  Enough amount of $ 299, and you get the Whitebox - developer kit, which is a small white box that can break away from the metal surface by a couple of centimeters.  Despite its compactness, it can withstand up to 20 kilograms of load.  By the way, MFA is based on electromagnetism and the Lenz rule. <br><br>  ‚ÄúThe electromagnetic field of a magnet is the same over the entire surface and has a north and south pole,‚Äù explains Henderson.  ‚ÄúWhat if we take this magnet and create a magnetic field on one side only, and then combine it with other magnetic fields to focus and control their strength?  This is Magnetic Field Architecture. ‚Äù  According to Greg, the development of his team is absolutely safe, especially in comparison with other types of maglevs. <br><br><blockquote><h4>  Testing a hoverboard occurs both on a flat surface and on a small halfpipe in order to demonstrate all its management features that cannot be compared with any sport. </h4></blockquote><br>  Josh Lowenson in the material on The Verge notes that the main problem that you immediately notice is the noise, comparing the work of a flying board with an air-raid siren.  Arx Pax is going to get rid of it in the coming year, subject to successful financial support for the project.  It is planned to solve the problem and, for example, energy efficiency - today's prototype can lift a person by only 7 minutes.  The plans also include reducing the cost of Hendo Hoverboard, but now the company plans to provide its development primarily to those who are going to refine and use it in their inventions. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/045/499/a53/045499a53b1846268722bbebe5635895.JPG"><br>  <b>Transrapid 05</b> <br><br>  Let's return to the perspectives of using MFA.  The movement of passengers and goods, using the strength of the electromagnetic field, routine for more than a dozen years.  Transrapid 05, the first magnetic train in the world, was created in 1979.  Today, the Maglevs are the fastest form of ground transportation, featuring relatively low maintenance and electricity costs.  The peculiarity of the technology from Arx Pax is in the cheapness of a meter of the road due to the lack of need for expensive equipment of the tracks. <br><br>  But what about houses?  In March last year, Greg Henderson filed a <a href="https://www.google.com/patents/US8777519%3Fdq%3Darx%2Bpax%26hl%3Den%26sa%3DX%26ei%3D8mdFVNn0H-GGigKI-oCICA%26ved%3D0CB0Q6AEwAA">patent</a> , which describes a system that provides engines in the very foundation of the building, which, if necessary, will be able to raise it.  It is difficult to imagine, given that today only small objects rise by a few centimeters.  However, in order to raise a larger volume and a larger enough higher force, the difficulty lies in the management and stabilization that the company is currently working on.  For research in this area, another cylinder-shaped box called Manta Ray is used, which can change the direction of movement. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/c16/79a/a03/c1679aa03a73448b84e53724ba0bc257.jpg"><br>  <b>Manta ray</b> <br><br>  Agree, it is difficult to remember a startup with such ambitious goals.  If you look at the whole path, at the end of which Arx Pax will learn how to move buildings, now all they can do is leave the starting point.  Designing a floating hoverboard, which costs several times cheaper than the current prototype and is sold, is already a huge success.  I would like to hope that they will succeed in this, and the houses rising above the water are still far away.  For some reason, it is much easier to believe in the management of climate and even tectonic processes by humans in the near future than to equip houses with similar technologies. <br><br>  Based on The Verge " <a href="http://www.theverge.com/2014/10/21/7025197/i-rode-a-real-hoverboard">I love your earthquakes and floods</a> " </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/362121/">https://habr.com/ru/post/362121/</a></p>
