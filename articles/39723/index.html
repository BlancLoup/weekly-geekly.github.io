  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Laws of nature or how to handle yourself</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Here I was jerked to turn on the laptop once and go online earlier than usual ... About 12 hours ... I mean at 7 in the morning.  And I saw a picture that, in principle, should have been expected.  ICQ is empty, the online list in various social networks is empty.  Of course, all the jokes about the night people and the fact that programmers have fangs and wool with patterns from the binary code appear at night long time ago and have been discussed three hundred times, but very few people have thought about it.  People who consider themselves ‚Äúnormal‚Äù have long ago taken into fashion to remind them that such a lifestyle kills, ruins, and in general, immorally decomposes and morally corrupts. <a name="habracut"></a>  And then an idea for an experiment came to my mind.  Try to sleep at night and sit down to learn a new language in the morning.  First, it went, if not to say with a bang, then at least for a strong three.  That is, the first three hours, I even managed to overcome several paragraphs and write a number of ‚Äúfun‚Äù program sets.  However, problems started after that.  His stomach rumbled sharply, his mouth was dry, and some old acquaintances, whom he had not seen for a century and hadn‚Äôt been going to see as many more, began to tear the phone to pieces ... <br><br>  In general, having figured out all the problems, he sat down again at the book.  In order not to violate the purity of the experiment, everything that I knew about OOP and the like had to be re-read.  And for some reason, in the process, desires suddenly began to appear that were absolutely not conducive to the process.  Listen to the music, see if there is anything new on the torrents, then in the end, it‚Äôs impossible to read the bash, which in principle is not quite typical for me. <br><br>  A friend, when I heard my outpourings, advised me to try lying down (the benefit of the laptop allows).  So what do you think, fell asleep with a book on his nose and a mouse in his hand.  A few hours later, waking up on his bed, wrapped with wire and a book, instead of a pillow under his head, an understanding of what was happening came to me.  Rather, one of the stories of the Strugatsky brothers came to mind, where one of the main characters expresses the idea that ‚ÄúWe are dealing with the laws of nature.  To fight against the laws of nature is stupid.  And it is a shame to capitulate before the law of nature ... ... The trouble is that this law is manifested uniquely - through unbearable pressure.  Through pressure that is dangerous for the psyche and even for life itself ... ... Maybe in time we will learn to divert this pressure to safe areas, and maybe even use them for our own purposes ...

I sat crouching, pressing my laptop to my stomach with both hands, and repeated to myself - for the tenth, for the twentieth time, I repeated to myself: "... since then everyone has been drawn in front of me by deaf devious trails ..." ‚Äù </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/39723/">https://habr.com/ru/post/39723/</a></p>
