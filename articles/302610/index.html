  <section class="page js-page"><h1>How have the career ladders and elevators in the IT industry changed over the past week?</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Someone last week (from May 30 to June 5) presented new career opportunities in the IT industry, and someone deprived of further prospects.  Public statements have become loud statements, which, however, have not yet been supported by specific cases. <br><br>  The mutual arrangement of specialists on career ladders changes with enviable regularity.  However, not all changes occur on their own. <br><br><h4>  And this one fell out of the nest </h4><br>  Tony Fadell, co-founder and CEO of the start-up <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nest_Labs">Nest</a> , bought by Google in 2014 for $ 3.2 billion, left the company, <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-06-03/nest-chief-fadell-leaves-after-tumultuous-two-years-at-google">reports</a> Bloomberg with reference to the management of the Alphabet holding. <a name="habracut"></a>

      As head of Nest, Tony Fadella will be replaced by Marwan Fawaz, former vice president of Motorola Mobility.  Fadell will continue to advise the management of the <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alphabet_Inc.">Alphabet</a> and personally the CEO of the holding Larry Page. <br><br>  In March 2016, The Independent published <a href="https://www.theinformation.com/inside-tony-fadells-struggle-to-build-nest">material</a> in which Nest workers criticized Fadella.  In their opinion, due to the management strategy of the CEO, the output of the company's products was significantly delayed, and over the last two Nest has not released a single fundamentally new product.  In addition, in 2015, about 70 people left the startup. <br><br><h4>  Leaving go </h4><br>  <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facebook">Facebook</a> representatives also have ‚Äúwishes‚Äù for their leader.  And in the near future, these wishes should turn into requirements. <br><br>  Facebook's board of directors has proposed that the founder and head of the social network, Mark Zuckerberg, be deprived of control over the company if he decides to step back from direct management or leave the company.  It is <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/us-facebook-proxyfiling-idUSKCN0YP08L">reported by</a> Reuters, referring to the appeal filed by the Board of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). <br><br>  At the general shareholders meeting of Facebook, the board of directors will offer shareholders to approve the decision to convert class B shares belonging to Zuckerberg if they leave the post of general director of the company.  The meeting will take place on June 20th. <br><br>  Class A shares are traded on the stock exchange and have the right to vote, class B shares are owned only by the persons involved in the company and have 10 votes on the piece.  As of June 2, Zuckerberg owned 4 million Class A shares and 419 million Class B. In total, they give him 53.8% of the vote. <br><br>  "The new conditions guarantee that we will not remain under the control of the founder of the company after he no longer leads us," explained such a move on Facebook's board of directors. <br><br><h4>  Self-proclaimed LinkedIn </h4><br>  It is no secret that Israel plays a huge role in the IT industry.  A lot of software and hardware technologies, which the whole world now uses, appeared right there.  In Israel, there are large divisions of almost all the leading IT companies in the world. <br><br>  But this time there was a reverse story: an Israeli company has <a href="https://roem.ru/03-06-2016/225665/letairvest-unomy/">developed</a> an analogue of a well-known social network.  Perhaps in Israel, someone will swing at Facebook, but for now the Israelis have limited themselves to LinkedIn. <br><br>  Analytical platform for marketing and B2B sales <a href="https://www.unomy.com/">Unomy</a> attracted $ 2.4 million investment from LETA Capital, Altair Capital and JanVest.  ‚ÄúIsraeli LinkedIn‚Äù (as they call themselves) will spend this money on expanding the functionality and hiring new sales professionals, says Unomy founder Gal Har-Zvi in ‚Äã‚Äãa LETA report. <br><br>  The platform extracts data about companies and employees from unstructured web resources, which are then analyzed using machine learning and NLP.  Work is possible both through the platform itself and through an extension for Chrome.  Now users have access to information about 5 million companies and 55 million specialists. <br><br>  <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/LinkedIn">LinkedIn</a> is a social network for searching and establishing business contacts.  LinkedIn has more than 400 million users (as of the end of 2015), representing 150 business sectors from 200 countries. <br><br><h4>  Who creates the "new Russian economy" </h4><br>  And in Russia, the creation of domestic analogues of IT products has recently become not just relevant: it gave the opportunity to many Russian IT companies to become market leaders.  Accordingly, those who actively developed in this direction before, are now becoming new ‚Äúnational heroes‚Äù and recognized ‚Äúdrummers of IT labor.‚Äù <br><br>  The RBC <a href="http://www.rbc.ru/photoreport/02/06/2016/574ef9549a79473118ae6558/1.shtml">publication has published a</a> list of 20 businessmen who create a ‚Äúnew Russian economy‚Äù.  All of them develop companies based on the latest technologies, and also develop industries and markets without relying on commodity services. <br><br>  The list included Telegram founder Pavel Durov - RBC chose him for promoting encrypted correspondence.  The list also included Sergei Belousov, the founder of Acronis and Parallels. <br><br>  Co-founder of mobile acquiring service 2can &amp; iBox Nikolai Zhmurenko promotes Fintech-sphere, indicates RBC.  The head of Kaspersky Lab, Evgeny Kaspersky, was noted for the development of cyber security, and the head of Yandex Data Factory, Evgeny Zavalishin, for his work in the field of data mining. <br><br>  Founder and CEO of EkzoAtlet Ekaterina Bereziy - for the appearance of accessible exoskeletons on the market. <br><br><h4>  Young - in the road </h4><br>  While mature and sophisticated personnel experience is changing the IT reality across the country, young and fledgling people are looking for opportunities to become part of this reality.  It is not surprising that large companies do not get tired of providing them with such opportunities: they need new personnel. <br><br>  <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mail.Ru_Group">Mail.Ru Group has</a> launched the third annual championship for the creation of IT projects among students of MSU, MIPT and Bauman Moscow State Technical University "Technostart".  The finalists of the competition will receive grants for 400 thousand rubles, the main prize will be the opportunity to undergo acceleration in the French start-up accelerator <a href="https://paris-en.numa.co/">Numa</a> . <br><br>  Only students of Moscow State University, MIPT and Bauman Moscow State Technical University can take part in the competition.  Applications are accepted until June 13 at <a href="http://techno-start.ru/register/">the</a> competition <a href="http://techno-start.ru/register/">website</a> .  The Mail.Ru Group noted that participants do not necessarily have experience in the field of programming and development - they can "try themselves in the role of product managers, designers or marketers." <br><br>  The championship will take place in several stages.  After registering the projects, experts from Mail.Ru Group, Numa Moscow and the MSU business incubator will select 25 ideas, which will pass to the second stage.  Five more projects will be chosen by the participants. <br><br>  In the framework of the second stage, the contestants will have to present their projects to the experts in the Moscow office of Mail.Ru Group.  In the third final stage will be 12 teams.  The championship final will be held in September - the contestants will have to submit ready-made products. <br><br><h4>  You are not dancing </h4><br>  The strip club Golden Girls and the Strip Club Association of Russia (ASC) threatened to <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superjob">sue the Superjob</a> recruitment site for refusing to publish a vacancy for a show ballet artist.  About this <a href="http://www.therunet.com/articles/6932">writes</a> theRunet. <br><br>  The club intends to go to court on behalf of the ASC, Yevgeny Shapovalov, a spokesman for Golden Girls and the association, told the publication. <br><br>  ‚ÄúVacancy meant just choreographic numbers that did not have an erotic element.  But, apparently, an overly zealous employee of this amazing agency liquidated a vacancy, and when we began to find out in the correspondence with him why, he replied, ‚Äúwe do not work with brothels,‚Äù he said. <br><blockquote>  Commercial Director of ASK Vadim Kisurkin clarified that a lawsuit will be filed if representatives of the Superjob do not make a formal apology within a month.  The plaintiff intends to file an application for three articles: 152 of the Civil Code of the Russian Federation (Protection of honor, dignity and business reputation), 150 of the Civil Code of the Russian Federation (Intangible goods and their protection) and 5.61 Administrative Code of the Russian Federation (Insult). </blockquote>  Golden Girls noted that they repeatedly published announcements on the search for waitresses, art director and choreographer on Superjob - all of them were moderated. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/302610/">https://habr.com/ru/post/302610/</a></p>
