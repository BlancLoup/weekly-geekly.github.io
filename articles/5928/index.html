  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Huge brand</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  I found an <a href="http://www.habrahabr.ru/blog/startup/8026.html">interesting article</a> on <a href="http://www.habrahabr.ru/blog/startup/8026.html">Habr√©</a> dedicated to our Academgorodok today.  Not lazy and came to the <a href="http://money.cnn.com/magazines/fortune/fortune_archive/2007/04/02/8403482/index.htm">source</a> .  It turns out that Fortune magazine published a material called The next Silicon Valley: Siberia.  All this, of course, is very good, and IBM and Schlubmerger really work with us, they actively save money on our employees, who can be paid five times less (this is not my fiction, we read the original source).  But there are some interesting points in the article that I would like to comment separately. <br><br>  ‚Äú <i>Time passes slowly in Novosibirsk.</i>  <i>The Skins of the Lenin statue.</i>  ‚ÄúWell, everything is clear here - amers, stuffed with anti-communist propaganda at the time, just like we are anti-capitalist, believe that in Russia everyone still worships Lenin, caresses and cherishes his many monuments and puts on everything red.  Nothing can be done about it, it will die out by itself with generations.  By the way, about the skaters, too, the true truth is that you represent it, and there are skateboards in Siberia too. <br><br>  The article also has a subtitle, which reads as follows: <a name="habracut"></a>  <i>‚ÄúA tech boom is giving life to a former Soviet center for science.</i>  <i>IBM, Intel - and even Oprah - are paying attention</i> . <i>‚Äù</i>  Oprah is not mentioned here for word of mouth (I think everyone knows that this is the saying "... and even Oprah" in the US has long been a popular figure of speech and Oprah is a purely common name).  So, as it turns out, a certain local company Axmor makes a web portal for Oprah.  And this is what her employee says: <i>"We didn‚Äôt really know who she was now."</i>  Do you understand, yes?  Again +1 point to ameriskom vanity.  I immediately draw both the farmer and the middle manager, who sit in Talahassee and NY, respectively, and ironically laugh: ‚ÄúWell, there they are in Siberia do not even know who Oprah is.  Wild land.  People of the mountains.  By the way, I have never heard of any Axmore.  Curious, looked at the site.  It turns out that the guys are not at all proud of their origin - the addresses and phone numbers of the Novosibirsk office are given purely in between cases, serious issues are resolved in the city of Pescadero, California.

      There is such a text.  <i>Screen Photo Electronic Instruments produces night-vision devices for a San Francisco firm.</i>  <i>"It's so cold here," says Vladimir Aksyonov,</i>  And a similar one in addition: ‚ÄúToday, Dmitry Verkhovod interrupts it.  "Look at this," he says, grinning with civic pride.  "Even out here in Siberia, I can receive DVDs, books, music." "All right, they have discredited us from head to toe.  There are no TVs here, they‚Äôre cold, they order DVDs and CDs from some Ozone - they don‚Äôt get any closer, and in general the Eskimos live here with the Chukchas, who need to save their money. <br><br>  The last straw that prompted me to put aside my thoughts in LiveJournal and on Habr√© were the words of a certain Dmitry Verkhovod: <i>"The Novosibirsk Akademgorodok is marketed."</i>  Well, just transnational brand.  Now for sure.  And what opinion of themselves did gentlemen officials and businessmen have?  Here's what the IT business representative thinks while sitting in the States?  As for unwashed Russia, it‚Äôs the USSR (after all, you see, only legally ex-people, our people are not going to rebuild our heads), quite good programmers are sitting in the cold, who take up to five times less work.  At the same time, the holidays may not go and work from dawn to dusk.  And taxes are there, with office space, generally penny.  And in the beginning slipped like this frazochka.  <i>"Inside Intel we have an expression," says Steve Chase, president of Intel Russia.</i>  <i>‚ÄúIf you have something tough, give it to the Americans.</i>  <i>If you have something difficult, give it to the Indians.</i>  <i>If you have something impossible, give it to the Russians. ‚Äù</i> So it‚Äôs safe, you can safely send to Russia what you‚Äôd like to do, and everyone‚Äôs hands don‚Äôt reach it.  Perhaps, amiss.  And between times let our code be audited. <br><br>  Just do not attack me now, defend Russia, our unforgettable homeland.  Grief-patriots and so we all sat on our necks.  I want to get me right.  Of course, we want this to be the case - a new high-tech center almost in the center of the country and certainly in the center of Siberia, huge salaries, doing nothing at work (this is about mastadonts, again, not to everyone).  But, forgive me, dear ones, you have to work for it and so far it‚Äôs far from it.  Have you seen how everything works in Delhi?  Even if the construction will start now, we will reach such scales at least in terms of appearance in 5 years, at least.  And by multiplying it by the traditional razdolbaystvo, we get all 10. <br><br>  By the way, about razdolbaystva.  You know, in a start-up Academgorodok, utilities do not know how to work at all.  I don‚Äôt know if this is connected with the work of the district administration (hello, Mr. Gordienko), it can be done by self-owned housing enterprises, but they clean the roads no more than once a week.  Very critical, especially now - during the period of active melting of snow, and in the snow.  So, what I mean.  We would first learn how to clean the roads.  A high tech he will come.  He will come without your help, gentlemen officials.  Just not interfere.  Divide there all the money at once and sit quietly, quietly, without tyranny.  Express yourself in different courses or belokurihah, say, who has not enough money to France.  And here, please do not interfere. <br><br>  What is this song about?  Yes, nothing.  This is my vision of all these issues, which will not end now.  Fortune magazine, by the way, thank you very much for not having come up with anything over the norm, inflating a soap bubble.  It's our here got used to such fun.  What is described is, no one will argue with that, but whether it will be better is a big question.  Maybe it‚Äôs true, after reading reviews, American financiers and IT-businessmen will run to us for saving money, cheer high-tech growth charts with new dollar zeros in numbers, and they will create a Siberian miracle.  In Russia, only optimists have always survived.  Others obviously left and entered the billionaire lists.  Do not lose hope and wait, gentlemen.  Meanwhile, we work. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/5928/">https://habr.com/ru/post/5928/</a></p>
