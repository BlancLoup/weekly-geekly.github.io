  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Dedicated servers and reviews about hosts</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  There were two big changes at <a href="http://hosting.cafe/">Hosting Cafe</a> : a <a href="http://dedicated.menu/">directory of dedicated servers was</a> launched and the opportunity to leave feedback on hosts appeared.  Both innovations are quite interesting, but I'll start with the reviews. <br><br> <a href="http://dedicated.menu/"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/475/3bb/32d/4753bb32d6374e989fce6329e726c7a1.png"></a> <br><br>  On all sites where you can leave your comments about the work of hosting companies you can never be sure that the reviews are written by real customers, and not by the hosters themselves.  In my opinion, the total value of such reviews is quite low, and it is almost impossible to verify that the review was written by a real client, and not by the hoster itself.  It is for this reason that the Hosting Cafe just did not have the opportunity to write reviews, but now the situation has changed completely, and we hope that this verification method will help to create the most truthful feedback base.  The essence of verification is that we ask the user to leave a phone number and contact him to confirm the review.  For such an ‚Äúinconvenience‚Äù we offer a bonus of <b>50 rubles</b> to the account of a mobile phone. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Thus, we will sift hosters who plan to write their own reviews to you, since no one will buy a pack of SIM cards for such an activity.  Such a system should also not put the user in an awkward position: a survey takes no more than two minutes, and a pleasant bonus will cover the time costs.  For reviews that have been tested, the corresponding inscription will be put, and readers can be sure that the review was written by a real client.

At the moment there are restrictions: the length of the response must be at least 500 characters, and each user can receive a bonus no more than three times.  Since the program works in test mode, we call and transfer rewards only to numbers of Russian operators.  If the program shows itself from the best side, this restriction will be removed. <br> <a href="http://hosting.cafe/review.php"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/7b6/125/586/7b612558643c4c608f0c22113cc2248d.png"></a> <br>  Adding a review does not take much time: you need to fill in the name, e-mail address (will not be published on the site), the text of the review and rating.  Optionally, you can list the advantages and disadvantages of the hoster: they will be used in the form of tags.  If the user wants to participate in the feedback program, a field will appear to enter the mobile phone number. <br><br><h2>  <a href="http://dedicated.menu/">DEDICATED.menu</a> </h2><br> <a href="http://dedicated.menu/"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/235/214/b11/235214b11f68410b807cc3b7da16b14f.png"></a> <br>  The site with <a href="http://dedicated.menu/">dedicated servers</a> turned out to be the most resource-intensive of all the projects of the <a href="http://hosting.cafe/">Hosting Cafe</a> .  Dedicated servers have much more parameters by which you can search, and the tariffs themselves change quite often.  Therefore, to promptly make changes to the tariff plans, we ask hosters to create a file upload with information about the tariffs that are currently on sale.  This upload is synchronized with the hosting billing and we always get the latest information.  The unloading itself contains information only about the price, so the addition of new tariffs occurs in manual mode.  However, this method allows you to update the tariffs as quickly as possible: if the server has disappeared from sale, it will be hidden automatically, if the price has changed, then it will also be updated automatically.  In case a hoster has a new server, then editors will receive a notification of this and will promptly add it. <br>  Unfortunately, this approach requires hosters to take certain actions, so at the moment the number of offers is small, however, the content is in full swing, and we will be happy to add new hosts. <br>  As I wrote earlier, the number of parameters by which you can search on dedicated servers is much more than other hosting services, so the development has some minor difficulties, and we made the assumption that there are very few servers with the same types of disks, but with different sizes , and decided to ignore such servers. <br>  At the moment, you can search by the following parameters: <br><ul><li>  The number and volume of SATA drives </li><li>  The number and volume of SAS drives </li><li>  The number and volume of SSD drives </li><li>  Availability of Hard RAID controller </li><li>  RAM size </li><li>  Number of processors </li><li>  The number of cores and their frequency </li><li>  Traffic </li><li>  Port speed and guaranteed speed </li><li>  Price per month, 3 months, half a year and a year </li><li>  Installation cost </li><li>  Country of equipment placement </li><li>  Operating systems that can be installed </li><li>  Payment methods hosting </li><li>  Administration included in server price </li><li>  Availability of licenses ISPmanager, cPanel, DirectAdmin or Windows Server </li><li>  IPv6 support </li><li>  Minimum payment period </li><li>  Equipment owner (reselling or equipment owned by the host) </li><li>  Host Age </li><li>  Site languages ‚Äã‚Äãand support languages </li></ul><br>  In addition to the above parameters, you can always see the exact processor model and, in most cases, the city of the data center location in the tariff card itself. <br> <a href="http://dedicated.menu/"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/75d/b0f/092/75db0f092dfa4e36a94249d10f010aaa.png"></a> <br>  We will be happy to hear feedback on the work of the feedback system and the site with dedicated servers. <br><br>  PS Also earned the English version of the search for dedicated servers - <a href="http://dedicated.click/">DEDICATED.click</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/279299/">https://habr.com/ru/post/279299/</a></p>
