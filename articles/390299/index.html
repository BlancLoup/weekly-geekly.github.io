  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Electric Scooter as a personal vehicle</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Now new vehicles are emerging around us, which so far are perceived more like toys for pleasure than transport.  But, perhaps, in a relatively short time, there will be a change in attitude towards electric scooters, monowheels and other light and affordable electrical devices.  For convenience, perhaps, it is worth uniting all of them with one name - personal portable electric transport. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/144/313/5d8/1443135d862c471dbd54d1058c4beda2.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Let's look at the pros and cons of using personal electric vehicles, calculate the approximate cost of use and think about whether we could use it as a utilitarian vehicle, and not just to go on a weekend in the park. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h4>  Usage scenarios </h4><br>  There are 2 main scenarios for the use of personal portable transport:

      <b>1</b> - we need to get from point A to point B. All the way we pass on our personal vehicle.  Everyone has their own preferences regarding the maximum possible distance, suitable weather, mood, fatigue.  My personal experience is this: <br><br><ul><li>  need a positive temperature </li><li>  no heavy precipitation </li><li>  good mood </li></ul><br>  Then, the normal distance for me will be about 15 kilometers in the conditions of the city, which I will be able to travel with pleasure by bicycle or electric scooter, preferring such transport to a car or a subway.  Repeatedly traveled along this route: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/15d/e2a/7b1/15de2a7b118c4556bd89e19bcc045a4d.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  <b>2</b> - we need to get their point A to point B, the distance between which makes it impossible to comfortably move on their personal electric vehicles - too far, too bad weather, not prepared infrastructure (for example, there is only a curb of the highway without alternative detour routes). <br><br>  In this case, the path is divided into three sections -B BC and CD, where -B and CD are sections where we move ‚Äúunder our own power‚Äù and BC is the section where we are driven by a subway, monorail or electric train. <br><br>  Actually, this use case is the way by which most of those who cannot / do not go there by car get to work every day in large cities. <br><br>  Requirements for the vehicle depending on the use case will be different.  If you need to move in the first scenario, then, in general, it will almost do not care what our vehicle's weight and portability (unless of course affect the features of storage / parking, the presence of an elevator at home, etc.) But, overall driving comfort will be important, mileage on single charge and maximum speed.  Most likely, a full-fledged electric bike with a large battery and a powerful engine will be the best means of transportation for the first scenario. <br><br>  For the second scenario, the very possibility of changing into public transport becomes extremely important, so weight and folding will be more important parameters than maximum mileage and speed.  The optimal means here are not big, light and folding structures: monowheels, electric scooters, hoverboards. <br><br><h4>  Calculation of the cost of use </h4><br>  Here I want to immediately say that the calculation is rather hypothetical, this is due to the fact that it was not possible to find complete statistics on the resource of various personal electric vehicles.  For an approximate calculation, I will take a fairly expensive and high-quality electric scooter, the owner of which I am.  To consider it as a ‚Äúspherical horse in a vacuum‚Äù I will not indicate the model and manufacturer, consider the characteristics and price. <br><br><ul><li>  Battery capacity - 500 watts hours </li><li>  Maximum speed - 30 km / h </li><li>  Mileage from a single charge (in greenhouse conditions, plus temperature, not many climbs, no strong wind) - 35 kilometers </li><li>  Full charge time - 2 hours </li><li>  Weight 11 kg </li><li>  Quickly folds into a very compact state. </li></ul><br>  From the scooter just blows reliability, and I quite seriously count on 600 full-time cycles of use.  I don‚Äôt know what will happen earlier - let's see: maybe it will be a battery, maybe wheels or shock absorbers.  The cost of the scooter is 60000 rubles.  It turns out 100 rubles per cycle or, if you drive 25 km between charges, then 4 rubles per kilometer. <br><br>  The cost of electricity is negligible in this case: a battery capacity of half a kilowatt hour, even if you take the charge efficiency as 50%, makes the cost of the charge equal to 3 rubles at the most expensive rate, that is, no more than 3% of the resource cost. <br><br><h4>  Comparison of the cost of use with other means of transportation: personal car, taxi, minibus / bus / trolleybus </h4><br><br>  <b>Private car</b> <br><br>  With a personal car, of course, the most difficult to compare is the cost of using different cars can vary by an order.  If we consider the cost of use for daily trips of a budget car by a very approximate formula: (fuel cost) x2 when the same amount that we spend on fuel is deposited on maintenance, insurance, replacing the car with a new one, then, again, approximately, in the urban cycle, mileage 100 kilometers of the road will cost us about 700 rubles (350 for fuel and resource expenses). <br><br>  Total one km - 7 rubles. <br><br>  <b>Taxi</b> <br><br>  According to Yandex Taxi: <br>  The average trip distance is 23 kilometers; <br>  The average cost is 560 rubles. <br><br>  We get the average cost per kilometer 20 rubles. <br><br>  <b>Minibus / bus / trolleybus</b> <br><br>  The average cost of the trip is 40 rubles. <br>  Average distance - 5 kilometers <br><br>  Total 8 rubles per kilometer. <br><br>  So, the considered electric scooter (recall that one of the most expensive on the market) is cheaper to use than any classic alternative. <br><br><h4>  average speed </h4><br>  According to subjective impressions, trips at a distance of up to 5 km are definitely faster than by car (where time is lost to start / warm up / drive out of parking / park) and even faster than public transport (where you need to walk to a stop, wait, walk from a stop) . <br><br>  By my estimate, with a maximum speed of 30 kilometers per hour, the average speed is about 20 kilometers per hour: time is lost at traffic lights and subways.  Of course, it strongly depends on driving style and road conditions. <br><br>  The average speed of travel by car in Moscow is 55 kilometers per hour, but including the night Moscow Ring Road and central lanes during the morning or evening rush hour is not a detailed enough parameter. <br><br>  For, again, personal observations in those moments when so many cars accumulate at traffic lights that they do not have time to drive in one cycle of traffic lights, movement on a scooter becomes faster than a car. <br><br><h4>  Conclusion </h4><br>  With a few assumptions, it can be argued that movement on an electric scooter is cheaper and comparable in time costs in a metropolis with a car, taxi and public transport. <br><br>  Expensive compact models can be used for both typical scenarios (both trips from point A to point B, and trips when personal transport is used to overcome the ‚Äúfirst‚Äù and ‚Äúlast mile‚Äù with high-speed public transport in the middle). <br><br>  Cheaper or specialized models may be more efficient to use for solving only one task - either relatively long trips from point to point on a heavy electric bicycle with high maximum speed, or, conversely, only short trips in the style ‚Äúto the metro and from the metro‚Äù ‚ÄùOn a simpler electric scooter or hoverboard. <br><br><h4>  Subjective conclusion </h4><br>  The main thing - to rebuild their perception of 11 pound toys.  It is possible not only to drive along the cycle paths in the park, but also to move very effectively on a daily basis. <br><br>  In the comments I am pleased to learn about your experience of using personal electric vehicles for solving daily tasks. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/390299/">https://habr.com/ru/post/390299/</a></p>
