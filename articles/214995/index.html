One of the most voracious components of the <abbr title="Data processing center">data center</abbr> is <abbr title="Storage System">storage</abbr> , due to the fact that the latter use a large number of mechanical hard drives.  Many have also heard that electricity "over the hill" is much more expensive.  And what about us? <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/fea/b1a/648/feab1a64803ca7aa82ac458637e01c6d.jpg"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  After reading a short article about <a href="http://blog.aboutnetapp.ru/archives/1324">comparing two models of NetApp FAS3250 and FAS8020</a> , I thought, ‚ÄúHow much cheaper is Flash for power consumption if we compare these two configurations?‚Äù. <br><br>  Knowing the power consumption of storage systems and configurations that were taken from <a href="http://spec.org/">spec.org</a> for performance testing of <abbr title="Storage System">storage systems</abbr> , we can conclude that some systems being more expensive at the initial purchase can ‚Äúlose a few extra pounds‚Äù and become cheaper compared to competitors in the cost of maintaining, because they use Flash technology.

      Below are the power consumption data for the following <abbr title="Storage System">storage systems</abbr> . <br><br><table><tbody><tr><th>  Model &amp; Config </th><th>  Typical kWatt * h </th><th>  Worst Case, kWatt * h </th><th>  Cell in the calculation </th></tr><tr><td>  <a href="http://spec.org/sfs2008/results/res2012q4/sfs2008-20121015-00216.html">FAS3250</a> </td><td>  9.68 </td><td>  10.03 </td><td>  B3 and C3 respectively </td></tr><tr><td>  <a href="http://spec.org/sfs2008/results/res2014q1/sfs2008-20140120-00235.html">FAS8020</a> </td><td>  2.35 </td><td>  3.51 </td><td>  D3 and E3 respectively </td></tr></tbody></table><br>  The FAS8020 is the ‚Äúsuccessor‚Äù of the older FAS3220, which in turn is ‚Äúlower class‚Äù than the FAS3250. <br><br>  Two tables were created: <br>  The first is the <b>calculation of the cost of electricity costs</b> and is available <i>for viewing</i> . <br>  The second table is <b>for data entry</b> and is <i>editable</i> . <br>  Separation of tables is done so that someone unintentionally does not delete or change formulas. <br><br>  <i>The cost of electricity</i> (cell i2) for Kiev can be viewed on the website of the <a href="http://www.nerc.gov.ua/%3Fid%3D4787">National Commission on Energy</a> .  I propose to take the 4th point from the top, i.e.  over 800 kW * hour per month, which corresponds to 95.76 kopecks or UAH 0.9576, which in turn is now approximately equal to $ 0.1.  For versatility, the form uses US dollars.  Of course, everyone can put the price specified in his electricity bills. <br><br><h5>  How to use the tables </h5><br>  Tables are created so that you can compare any of your values. <br>  Go to the table " <a href="http://bit.ly/1dMRKI1">for editing</a> ." <br>  We bring in the cell <i>B3</i> consumption for the first system, <i>C3</i> - The worst case of consumption by the system <br>  We bring in the cell <i>D3</i> consumption for the second system, <i>E3</i> - The worst case for the second system. <br>  These values ‚Äã‚Äãare in units of " <i>kW * hour</i> ". <br>  Next, we enter the price, in US dollars, in cell <i>i2</i> . <br>  Go to the table " <a href="http://j.mp/1jEN1Nl">to view</a> " (here you may need to wait a little while google pulls data from the first table) and compare the difference between the power consumption costs of the first and second systems in the two <b>Diff</b> columns: Typical and Worst Case. <br><br>  If suddenly someone accidentally erased everything from the ‚Äúfor editing‚Äù table, go to the <i>Original Input Data</i> tab (table <i>for viewing</i> ) and simply copy everything into a table <i>for editing</i> .  I want to draw your attention to the fact that Google for some reason does not always pull up data from other tables or is not always on time or is not always the most current data ‚Äî here you need to either wait or reload the page in a new browser window.  In addition, there may be a case when several people will work simultaneously on editing the table, the number of simultaneously open sessions is visible at the top right - use the commenting function in the file to agree on the order of changes or just wait until everyone leaves. <br><br><h5>  Flash savings </h5><br>  As can be seen from the performance test, the FAS8020 is slightly better in terms of throughput and slightly better in response speed (latency), while the cost of electricity costs for 5 years of this system is approximately 300 thousand kW / h <b>less</b> and, accordingly, it is <b>cheaper by about 30 Thousands of $</b> than a similar system with a large number of spindles.  Both systems are available to order via NetApp channels (as of 18/03/2014). <br><br><h5>  Cooling </h5><br>  Despite the fact that the cost of air conditioning in this calculation does not participate, do not forget also that, as a rule, the amount of energy consumed is almost equal to or slightly lower than the amount of heat released.  And this heat must be removed not cheap powerful air conditioning, which also consume electricity. <br><br><h5>  Conclusion </h5><br>  Although this rule for saving money with Flash may not always work, nevertheless, this technology provides an additional ‚Äúregulator‚Äù of <abbr title="Storage System">storage storage</abbr> options and allows for improved performance and responsiveness to reduce maintenance costs both for <abbr title="Storage System">storage systems</abbr> and for the <abbr title="Data processing center">data center</abbr> as a whole. <br><br>  <b>I am asking you to send comments on misprints in the text and suggestions on how to correct it.</b> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/214995/">https://habr.com/ru/post/214995/</a></p>
