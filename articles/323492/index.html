This is logical and easy to explain - it all depends on the tasks and business model of a particular company.

      For example, colleagues from Sports.ru told us about the experience of creating their own IT infrastructure.  This story began back in 2007, when the market of Russian IaaS providers was just emerging.  Working with their systems allowed the company to thoroughly understand the issues of load balancing at peak times, when the volume of traffic increases tenfold.  Today, Sports.ru sees a good platform for IaaS to experiment and launch pilot projects.  The reason: the speed and ease of scaling. <br><br>  Another example is our direct client - Hotels.ru hotel reservation service.  Long-term cooperation with the team of our IaaS-provider allows the project to talk openly about the advantages of working with a virtual infrastructure: <br><br><blockquote>  The whole beauty of the cloud is realized when the traffic on the site increases tenfold before the holidays and the power needs to be urgently raised.  At the dawn of the service, this caused a natural panic and an emergency, and now the issue is solved by adding virtual processors and IOPS to the disk system. <br><br>  As soon as the peak was asleep and, according to predictions, repetitions are not foreseen, we disconnect the temporarily allocated capacities in order not to pay extra. <br><br>  - Team Hotels.ru </blockquote><br>  Today, the project team does not need to spend time on administering its hardware - you can work only with those resources that are needed at a specific point in time, and creative efforts can already be spent on business development. <br><br> <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/company/it-grad/blog/258389/"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/b68/7d2/008/b687d20085604b57a4822dcfaeb22a24.jpg"><br></a>  <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/company/it-grad/blog/258389/">/ Using IaaS-clouds for a loaded web project: the Hotels.ru experience</a> <br><br>  Another example of working with a Russian startup is cooperation with the PickPoint network of postamats.  The principle of operation is to provide customers with a geographically distributed network of terminals with storage cells, from which it is possible to pick up packages from online stores at any convenient time. <br><br>  At the start of the project, PickPoint decided to choose a borrowed infrastructure, but as the network of postamats grew, maintaining and updating its own IT infrastructure was not economically viable.  As a result, the team turned to the use of <a href="http://it-grad.ru/iaas/iaas-vmware/virtual-infrastructure/">our resources</a> . <br><br><blockquote>  At the moment of rapid growth, the pluses of the cloud were fully appreciated - for us, this is primarily a flexible scaling.  Even when it is impossible to predict the increase in load and buy it in reserve, you can always ‚Äúbuild up the muscles‚Äù of virtual systems as needed in a couple of clicks. <br><br>  In recent years, we have seriously worked on the availability of systems.  There are two application servers with IIS, and they work in a cluster with an external balancer.  The database server is backed up with vSphere HA, and the WAN connections are now duplicated. <br><br>  - PickPoint Team </blockquote><br> <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/company/it-grad/blog/262859/"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/a32/abe/168/a32abe168bcf4be6b49fec2b07bb81aa.jpg"></a> <br>  / <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/company/it-grad/blog/262859/">IaaS for a startup: Cooperation with the PickPoint postcard network</a> <br><br>  Virtual infrastructure is not a universal solution for all problems related to the IT component of your business, but it is ideally suited for flexible scaling of IT systems and translating experimental designs.  IaaS allows you to invest time in the work on the immediate tasks of the company. <br><br>  This factor is particularly important for full-time IT professionals, immersed in the routine of ongoing maintenance and administration of employee workstations, server reconfiguration, and communications at the office.  Working with IaaS allows you to devote most of your work tasks to outside and make time for full-time professionals who are already able to do something more interesting and think about how to develop your business. <br><br>  Another case from our practice is cooperation with the ServiceNow project and its integration into the work of the Sochi Autodrome operational center, which deals with the Russian stage of the Formula 1 Grand Prix. Of course, there is no longer any discussion about the scale of the startup, but nevertheless, this example It shows well the cloud's capabilities in solving the most ambitious tasks - in this case it was necessary to start a partnership agreement on MSP (Managed Service Provider) with ServiceNow and provide access to their services in accordance with 152- ‚ÄúAbout personal data‚Äù on the territory  territory of the Russian Federation. <br><br><blockquote>  ‚ÄúServiceNow, from our point of view, is the best solution for automating ITIL processes on the market, as evidenced by its rapid growth abroad.  Many international, as well as some Russian companies, being on the territory of Russia, use ServiceNow from the ‚Äúforeign cloud‚Äù. <br><br>  Within the framework of the existing requirements of the legislation (152- ‚ÄúAbout personal data‚Äù) there is a need to transfer this system to Russia.  IT-GRAD, under the MSP agreement established with ServiceNow, offers a new service for using ServiceNow solutions based on its own data centers in the Russian Federation, which solves the problem of storing personal data in Russia. <br><br>  I think the inclusion in the portfolio of SaaS solutions offered by IT-GRAD company of such a wonderful product as ServiceNow will be enthusiastically received on the Russian market ‚Äù <br><br>  - Dmitry Gachko, General Director, IT-GRAD </blockquote><br>  Of course, the last case is already a level beyond the framework of a startup, and most likely relates to medium-sized businesses, process automation and work with IT standards like ITIL.  We will talk about this in more detail in the following publications in our blog. <br><br>  PS Other materials from our blog: <br><br><ul><li>  <a href="http://iaas-blog.it-grad.ru/iaas-%25D0%25B8%25D0%25BB%25D0%25B8-%25D0%25B2%25D0%25B8%25D1%2580%25D1%2582%25D1%2583%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BB%25D1%258C%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B0%25D1%258F-%25D0%25B8%25D0%25BD%25D1%2584%25D1%2580%25D0%25B0%25D1%2581%25D1%2582%25D1%2580%25D1%2583%25D0%25BA%25D1%2582%25D1%2583%25D1%2580%25D0%25B0-vmware-%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B0-%25D0%25BF%25D1%2580%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BA%25D1%2582%25D0%25B8%25D0%25BA%25D0%25B5-%25D1%2587%25D0%25B0%25D1%2581%25D1%2582%25D1%258C-1-%25D1%2580%25D0%25B0%25D0%25B1%25D0%25BE%25D1%2582%25D0%25B0-%25D1%2581-%25D0%25BA%25D0%25B0%25D1%2582%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BB%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B3%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BC-%25D0%25B8-%25D1%2581%25D0%25B5%25D1%2582%25D1%258C%25D1%258E">IaaS or VMware Virtual Infrastructure in Practice</a> </li><li>  <a href="http://iaas-blog.it-grad.ru/vmware-vsphere-client-3.0-%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B1%25D0%25B7%25D0%25BE%25D1%2580-%25D0%25BA%25D0%25BB%25D1%258E%25D1%2587%25D0%25B5%25D0%25B2%25D1%258B%25D1%2585-%25D0%25BE%25D1%2581%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B1%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BD%25D0%25BD%25D0%25BE%25D1%2581%25D1%2582%25D0%25B5%25D0%25B9">VMware vSphere Client 3.0 - an overview of key features</a> </li><li>  <a href="http://iaas-blog.it-grad.ru/%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BF%25D1%2582%25D0%25B8%25D0%25BC%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B7%25D0%25B0%25D1%2586%25D0%25B8%25D1%258F-%25D0%25BF%25D1%2580%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B7%25D0%25B2%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B4%25D0%25B8%25D1%2582%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BB%25D1%258C%25D0%25BD%25D0%25BE%25D1%2581%25D1%2582%25D0%25B8-%25D0%25B2-vsphere-%25D1%2580%25D0%25B5%25D1%2588%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B5-%25D0%25BE%25D1%2581%25D0%25BD%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B2%25D0%25BD%25D1%258B%25D1%2585-%25D0%25BF%25D1%2580%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B1%25D0%25BB%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BC-%25D1%2581-cpu">Performance Optimization in vSphere: Solving Major CPU Problems</a> </li><li>  <a href="http://iaas-blog.it-grad.ru/vmware-nsx-%25D0%25BD%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B2%25D1%258B%25D0%25B9-%25D0%25BF%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B4%25D1%2585%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B4-%25D0%25BA-%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B1%25D0%25B5%25D1%2581%25D0%25BF%25D0%25B5%25D1%2587%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B8%25D1%258E-%25D0%25B1%25D0%25B5%25D0%25B7%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BF%25D0%25B0%25D1%2581%25D0%25BD%25D0%25BE%25D1%2581%25D1%2582%25D0%25B8-%25D0%25B2-%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B1%25D0%25BB%25D0%25B0%25D1%2581%25D1%2582%25D0%25B8-%25D0%25B7%25D0%25B4%25D1%2580%25D0%25B0%25D0%25B2%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BE%25D1%2585%25D1%2580%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B8%25D1%258F">VMware NSX: A New Approach to Health Security</a> </li><li>  <a href="http://iaas-blog.it-grad.ru/vmware-cloud-foundation-%25D1%2583%25D0%25BF%25D1%2580%25D0%25BE%25D1%2589%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BD%25D0%25BD%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B5-%25D1%2580%25D0%25B0%25D0%25B7%25D0%25B2%25D0%25B5%25D1%2580%25D1%2582%25D1%258B%25D0%25B2%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B5-%25D0%25BF%25D1%2580%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B3%25D1%2580%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BC%25D0%25BC%25D0%25BD%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B3%25D0%25BE-%25D1%2586%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B4-%25D0%25B8-%25D0%25B3%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B1%25D1%2580%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B4%25D0%25BD%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B3%25D0%25BE-%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B1%25D0%25BB%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BA%25D0%25B0">VMware Cloud Foundation: Simplified Software Data Center and Hybrid Cloud Deployment</a> </li><li>  <a href="http://iaas-blog.it-grad.ru/%25D1%2580%25D0%25B5%25D1%2588%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B5-%25D0%25BF%25D1%2580%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B1%25D0%25BB%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BC%25D1%258B-%25D0%25BF%25D0%25BE%25D1%2582%25D0%25B5%25D1%2580%25D0%25B8-%25D1%2581%25D0%25B5%25D1%2582%25D0%25B5%25D0%25B2%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B3%25D0%25BE-%25D0%25BF%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B4%25D0%25BA%25D0%25BB%25D1%258E%25D1%2587%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B8%25D1%258F-%25D1%2583-%25D0%25B2%25D0%25B8%25D1%2580%25D1%2582%25D1%2583%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BB%25D1%258C%25D0%25BD%25D1%258B%25D1%2585-%25D0%25BC%25D0%25B0%25D1%2588%25D0%25B8%25D0%25BD-vmware-%25D0%25B2-%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B1%25D0%25BB%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BA%25D0%25B5-iaas">Solving the problem of network connection loss in VMware virtual machines in the IaaS cloud</a> </li><li>  <a href="http://iaas-blog.it-grad.ru/%25D0%25BE%25D1%2581%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B1%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BD%25D0%25BD%25D0%25BE%25D1%2581%25D1%2582%25D0%25B8-%25D1%2580%25D0%25B5%25D1%2588%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B8%25D1%258F-vmware-virtual-san-vsan">VMware Virtual SAN (vSAN) Solution Features</a> </li></ul></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/323492/">https://habr.com/ru/post/323492/</a></p>
