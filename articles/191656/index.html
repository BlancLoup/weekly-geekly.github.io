    <a name="habracut"></a><br><br><h4>  Terminology </h4><br>  Below in the text, I often use the untranslated word "community" because I do not like the words "community" (gives something elusively Soviet) and "party" (gives something pop), although evil languages ‚Äã‚Äãoften use both these words by relation to what we are doing here.  And use, having for that some reason. <br><br><h4>  Motivation </h4><br>  Meetings JUG.ru organizes a whole team - a few people who <s>still do not know about this post</s> , each have their own vision of the situation.  Each of them has their own goals and their own motivation.  For all I, for obvious reasons, I can not speak.  But I will say a few words about my <i>initial</i> motivation. <br><br>  It all started about two years ago.  It became obvious that Java in the form in which I see it and Java in the form in which it now exists in the industry are two different types of java.  Working a couple of years in St. Petersburg as a beginner Java programmer in various Enterprise projects, I was doing something like the following: <br><ul><li>  riveted xml configs </li><li>  fiddling with build </li><li>  drew pseudo-html-pages using different template engines </li><li>  wrote queries to a database of varying degrees of complexity and debt </li><li>  debugged JavaScript code behavior in various browsers. </li></ul><br>  And everything in this list is good.  Except for one fact.  This is <i>not Java</i> . <br><br>  And then a miracle happened.  I began to work in a project that is not related to the ‚Äúbloody groundbreaking enterprise‚Äù and in a strange way I felt better.  It became clear that the world exists outside the JavaEE stack and that I feel much more comfortable in it.  And again I get a buzz from work. <br><br>  Similar reaches for similar.  It remained to find other people who also get high from the programming work.  Find, meet and talk.  Discuss anything programmatic.  And then it became clear that somewhere I had already seen this. <br><br><h4>  Devclub </h4><br> <a href="http://devclub.eu/"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/52d/68a/8a2/52d68a8a2596e8d9980f55f8a8195c1f.jpg" align="left"></a> <br>  In Tallinn.  Some guys <a href="http://devclub.eu/">gather</a> once a month and chat on programmer topics.  And remove <s>porn</s> videos, which then spread on the site.  After talking with the local antonarhipov <a href="https://habr.com/ru/users/antonarhipov/" class="user_link">coolman</a> , my old friends from <a href="http://ru-java.livejournal.com/">ru_java</a> , I decided that I wanted to do something in the same spirit. <br><br>  My only serious complaint was the ‚Äúlightness‚Äù of the devclub: the reports of very different people from very different areas allowed us to hang around fun, but they didn‚Äôt allow me to give a rough immersion to the topic.  If you tell about your gadgets for Ruby-on-Rails to people who program microcontrollers - do not hope that they will understand you well.  Therefore, in devil club, great emphasis is placed precisely on fan and party.  This is cool, but I wanted something else: more immersion into problems and deep into technology. <br><br><h4>  The first steps </h4><br>  Anton lucidly explained that doing a community in sting is hard work and that a team is needed.  The team was formed in the shortest possible time and immediately began to actively think what was needed for the start.  It turned out that we need <br><ul><li>  Theme </li><li>  Speaker </li><li>  The room </li><li>  Site </li><li>  Distribution channels </li><li>  Video camera (the need to shoot a video was an axiom) </li><li>  <s>Will of allah</s> </li><li>  patience </li><li>  Jacob Sirotkin's blessing </li></ul><br><br><h4>  Jacob Sirotkin </h4><br> <a href="http://telamon.ru/"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/3db/eaf/ad4/3dbeafad48b4291469064915e9e31345.jpg" align="left"></a> <br><br>  A post about Java in Russia has no right to life without a couple of words about Yakov Sirotkin.  He was the one who carried Java to the masses from about 1999: he began to gather people, promote the right ideas, shoot video, write reports, etc.  And for more than 10 years, Jacob was the face of JUG.ru and the living embodiment of what is now called a ‚ÄúJava enthusiast.‚Äù  I was able to attend Yashin JUG‚Äôs last for today in St. Petersburg, and it was very cool! <br><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Who does not believe - see for yourself</b> <div class="spoiler_text">  <a href="http://video.yandex.ru/users/ysirotkin/view/2/">http://video.yandex.ru/users/ysirotkin/view/2/</a> <br><br>  <a href="http://video.yandex.ru/users/ysirotkin/view/3/">http://video.yandex.ru/users/ysirotkin/view/3/</a> <br></div></div><br>  In an email correspondence dated January 2012, Yasha explained that he <br><ul><li>  departed from Java development at the moment </li><li>  JUG.ru is not planning to meet </li><li>  <s>blessing is</s> not against other people doing jug </li></ul><br><br><h4>  Sergey Klimenkov </h4><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/03b/825/6b5/03b8256b5b8b07aa38ac7c4548dff489.jpg" align="left"><br>  The 1999 model JUG.ru had two co-founders - Yakov Sirotkin and Sergey Klimenkov.  Sergey all these years (and still!) Provides the server and domain support.  He led the first sponsor, and the first meeting of JUG.ru took place at the Elcom office, whose technician Sergey then worked.  And I must say that at first, Jacob, by his own admission, was absolutely inexperienced, and Sergei already taught Java at ITMO, so it was unlikely that anything would happen without his support and advice. <br><br>  Jacob met Sergey at a meeting of NWGSM users, now not everyone remembers what it is.  Then, of course, it came to light that Jacob was a violent man, and Sergei was busy, and after a few years Jacob became much more famous.  But on the <a href="http://www.java.spb.ru/servlets/index%3Fpage%3Dabout">‚ÄúAbout Us‚Äù</a> page they were always together (by the way, we should return them to this page on the new site).  Here, by the way, is a <a href="http://www.java.spb.ru/servlets/index">mirror of the</a> old site. <br><br><h4>  Creative flour </h4><br>  We continued to communicate with <a href="https://habr.com/ru/users/antonarhipov/" class="user_link">antonarhipov</a> on the organization of events.  There were a variety of ideas: from the programmer conference to the organization of the St. Petersburg branch of DevClub.  There were many controversial ideas, different formats were discussed, but it quickly became clear that he was exactly the person we want to call as the first speaker.  And the topic somehow suggests itself.  And then I went to the famous Java enthusiast Sasha Belokrylov to discuss the possibility of holding a meeting in the St. Petersburg office of Oracle. <br><br><h4>  Alexander Belokrylov </h4><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/121/a66/0bb/121a660bbed22aefb6fd6fa0bd9453c7.jpg" align="left"><br>  Sasha was the one who had the idea to make a meeting with Anton exactly JUG.  And not <a href="http://www.devclub.eu/">Devclub</a> 'om, <a href="http://vk.com/codefreeze">CodeFreeze</a> ' om or something else.  There was no reason not to listen to him: for several years, Sasha has been bringing Java to the masses, organizing <a href="http://oracle.timepad.ru/events/">Java Day</a> throughout the Russian-speaking world and working with <a href="http://oracle.timepad.ru/events/">Java</a> Bloch‚Äôs organization <a href="http://www.oracle.com/javaone/ru-ru/index.html">JavaOne Russia</a> .  Sasha said that he had been thinking over the revival of JUG.ru for a long time, and that the arrival of Anton Arkhipov was a great opportunity for such a revival.  In general, there were no ‚Äúagainst‚Äù arguments. <br><br><h4>  Technology </h4><br>  Here it should be said that only one member of our team, Andrei Dmitriev ( <a href="https://habr.com/ru/users/real_ales/" class="user_link">real_ales</a> ), had experience in organizing any events.  Vanya Dolgov and I had no such experience, so it was rather dumb. <br><br>  They decided to hold the meeting on Saturday, February 25, 2012.  We made an <a href="http://jugru.timepad.ru/events/">account on the timepad</a> , made a <a href="http://jugru.timepad.ru/event/19081/">meeting there</a> and realized that you need to call the people.  The following ways of disseminating information about the meeting were chosen: <br><ul><li>  our friends and colleagues whom we write VKontakte </li><li>  visitors to previous <a href="http://oracle.timepad.ru/events/">events of the St. Petersburg Oracle</a> , who agreed to receive interesting announcements </li><li>  Visitors of past meetings JUG.ru </li></ul><br><br>  Everything was simple with friends and colleagues: we created <a href="http://vk.com/jugru">a VKontakte group</a> , where we posted an announcement of the upcoming meeting, to which we gave VKontakte and Skype links to everyone.  Visitors of previous meetings also received <s>spam</s> email from us with the announcement of the meeting.  Everything described happened a couple of weeks before the planned meeting.  We somehow forgot about the visitors of the previous meetings of JUG.ru, although they probably could have asked Yasha Sirotkin to give an announcement in his old mailing list. <br><br><h4>  results </h4><br>  For two weeks, which lasted registration, 130 people came to the meeting.  60 people came to the meeting directly. The meeting was delayed for two and a half hours, including a 20-minute coffee break in the middle.  In addition, we made a video of the meeting with our crooked hands: <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/7QS8mfuEaFA" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br><h4>  Organizational issues </h4><br>  A number of important decisions were made, which later gave their results: <br><ul><li>  start an internal wiki where to record everything that happens (meetings, reports, tasks) and where to store useful materials </li><li>  hold weekly meetings strictly according to the agenda </li><li>  distribute tasks in the form of tickets in the bugtracker </li></ul><br>  As a result, tasks began to be tracked in the agenda of meetings on the following technology: <br><ul><li>  Tasks are created at the meeting and exactly one responsible person is appointed. </li><li>  The rally log is maintained by the attendant and is recorded directly on the wiki page of the rally to the agenda.  So-called ‚Äúminutes‚Äù are obtained. </li><li>  The agenda for the next rally is created from the minutes of the previous one by deleting completed tasks and adding new ones added during the rally.  No task is removed from the Agenda just like that. </li></ul><br>  This system has been living for a year and a half and makes us happy.  But the bugtracker did not catch on.  The main reason is that when we used it - there was a duplication of tasks in minutes / agent and bug tracker. <br><br><h4>  Lectorium </h4><br>  About 4 months after we launched the updated JUG.ru, <a href="https://habr.com/ru/users/yasha_somov/" class="user_link">yasha_somov</a> , the founder of the famous video library <a href="https://habr.com/ru/users/yasha_somov/" class="user_link">Lectorium</a> , came to us.  Yasha said that he has free operators in the summer, and therefore he wants to shoot us for fun.  It was a crucial moment, because <br><ul><li>  the quality of our videos at the time left much to be desired </li><li>  the one of us who shot the video partially fell out of what the speaker was talking about </li><li>  We didn‚Äôt have our video camera, and I had to go to a friend on the other end of the city behind the camera, and then, in three or four days, lead him to the camera back. </li></ul><br><br>  In general, Lectorium helped us.  In addition to shooting the video, they invited their photographer to us, who began to shoot every meeting of JUG.ru.  Photos can be found <a href="http://vk.com/albums-35491074">here</a> . <br><br><h4>  Sponsors </h4><br>  But the school year was approaching, which means Lectorium again got things to do besides us.  Shooting photos and videos costs some money, and considering that we were doing not only JUG.ru by that time, but we already launched <a href="http://vk.com/codefreeze">CodeFreeze</a> in St. Petersburg, the money was substantial. <br><br>  And at this moment Anton Fedchin, technical director of <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/odnoklassniki/">Odnoklassniki</a> company, came to us.  They have a very serious Java on the servers there, as apangin, the leading engineer of Odnoklassniki, told about one of the JUGs <a href="https://habr.com/ru/users/apangin/" class="user_link">.</a> <br><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Video c speech Andrei Pangin</b> <div class="spoiler_text"><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/gIh0X-RkftY" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/h9AICWfaEVQ" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br></div></div><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/f4d/cca/716/f4dcca716a859d3fdc549082cfe7d310.png" align="left"><br>  To solve problems of this class, we need very serious engineers, and they decided to look for them in the Java community.  In addition, any help to the community is a big plus in karma.  If other companies understood this, you see, other programmer communities would also appear!  And the bosses, managers and recruiters of companies would not complain about the shortage of qualified programmers.  And the fact that competent meetings on good topics raise the qualifications of the participants - we personally have no doubts! <br><br>  And now <s>look out the window</s> going terrible.  In addition to the above-mentioned Tallinn Devclub and not always technical CodeFreeze in St. Petersburg and Moscow, we have the following: <br><ul><li>  St. Petersburg, Moscow, Tver and Kevt altnets seem to be completely dead </li><li>  <a href="http://devclub.ru/">Devclub in St. Petersburg</a> fell into a coma, not really starting </li><li>  and only <a href="http://it-talk.spb.dataart.ru/">IT Talk</a> is brewed in some kind of SoftSkills porridge of its own (yes, this is a complaint! Throw rotten tomatoes at me!). </li></ul><br><br><h4>  Moscow JUG </h4><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/796/16f/852/79616f8527c0932d122ff8cbac2447c2.jpg" align="left"><br>  Nice to know that you are an example for someone.  The leader of the Moscow JUG, Andrei Kogun, amusing our Petersburg ego, took an example from us and started a <a href="http://vk.com/jugmsk">JUG in Moscow</a> . <br>  The technology partner of the Moscow JUG is <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/croc/">CROC</a> , which has recently been a partner of the St. Petersburg JUG. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/281/139/db5/281139db5b44c1770d3673c88a5ef131.jpg" align="left"><br>  Now the Moscow JUG break is associated with summer holidays and with the JavaOne Russia conference held in April in Moscow.  But starting in September, Andrei vows to renew meetings of the Moscow JUG and is preparing, as we know, a couple of surprises to Moscow-lovers of Java! <br><br><h4>  JPoint Conference </h4><br>  For several years in a row, Sun, and later Oracle, held a Java conference in St. Petersburg.  This conference had several main features, including: mass, free of charge and a large number of interesting speakers from Sun / Oracle.  The conference changed the format and title several times: first Sun Tech Days, then Java Tech Day, then just Java Day. <br><br>  In 2013, Oracle decided not to hold a Java conference in St. Petersburg.  In this situation, our Java User Group decided not to abandon the St. Petersburg Java developers and held its own Java conference.  We made it the way we considered it necessary, that is to say, without looking at anyone's opinion.  As a result, on Friday, April 5, 2013, the first (and we hope not the last) independent <a href="http://javapoint.ru/">JPoint</a> Java conference was <a href="http://javapoint.ru/">held</a> at the <a href="http://javapoint.ru/">PetroCongress</a> Congress <a href="http://javapoint.ru/">Center</a> . <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/97e/160/5e6/97e1605e6af6dc21c0621df2c883fc2c.jpg"><br><br>  The entire conference was filmed and uploaded to <a href="http://www.youtube.com/user/JUGRuVideo">the</a> JUG.ru <a href="http://www.youtube.com/user/JUGRuVideo">Youtube channel</a> as a <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3DOLeli93LM7A%26list%3DPLVe-2wcL84b_v45ufYBhiktO68VmiJF9K">separate playlist</a> . <br><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Several videos from the JPoint conference</b> <div class="spoiler_text"><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/6y-4xJWFLl4" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/uZfK-9ixxec" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/k2efjgRxMp8" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br></div></div><br><br><h4>  Joker conference </h4><br>  In October, JUG.ru will hold another Java conference.  It will be called Joker.  The conference program is formed by two thirds and looks, in our opinion, quite powerful.  <a href="http://jokerconf.com/">See for yourself</a> . <br><br> <a href="http://jokerconf.com/"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/b72/f4b/684/b72f4b684bca31fa17b5b46581e93009.png"></a> <br><br><h4>  JUG Saturday Invitation </h4><br>  And finally, I want to invite you again to our next meeting.  This Saturday, August 31, guests from sunny Israel, <a href="https://habr.com/ru/users/jbaruch/" class="user_link">jbaruch</a> and <a href="https://habr.com/ru/users/evgenyborisov/" class="user_link">EvgenyBorisov,</a> will perform in front of us at the PetroCongress congress center.  We will talk about building projects, the problems of modularization of software, storage binaries and high load.  And all this, of course, with java sauce. <br><br>  Coming expect a good mood, lunch and four reports: <br><ul><li>  Development of modular software - welcome to AD! </li><li>  eXtreme Application Platform </li><li>  Scalable cloud service from scratch </li><li>  Power of gradle </li></ul><br>  <b>Participation, as always, is free.</b>  <b>Beginning at 12.00.</b>  <b><a href="http://jugru.timepad.ru/event/72119/">Details and registration here</a></b> . </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/191656/">https://habr.com/ru/post/191656/</a></p>
