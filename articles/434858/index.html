The next step will be the world's first jetpack racing series, which will begin in 2019, and yes, all existing jet boards and jet suits of the world are invited to participate! <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  It is said that the first race on motorcycles occurred on the same day when the second motorcycle was assembled - and it is not difficult to believe.  With personal aircrafts, the key players should be much more careful and methodical.  Just one major incident with JA‚Äôs jetpacks by JPA or Flyboard Air designed by Frank Zapata may not only literally deprive the world of the pioneers of the industry who are making this aircraft revolution, but will also face legal restrictions that will spoil all the pleasure left behind [in living brave men]. <br><br>  So, for the most part, everyone in this game does everything possible to avoid any risk, or at least pretends to be good.  Jetpack Aviation‚Äôs David Meiman went so far that he received an FAA certificate as the world's only registered jetpack instructor, which allowed the JPA <a href="https://habr.com/company/jethackers/blog/426923/">to conduct a series of training events</a> on the basics of piloting a jetpack for the general public and to build a scheme by which jetpack owners can legally pass preparation before these roaring cars are fastened to their backs and dashed into the clouds.

Moreover, while there is no information that someone really tried to reach these theoretical limit values.  At the moment it is a kind of uncharted territory of the Wild West. <br><br>  But, according to Meiman, it's high time that the personal aircraft industry gets an accelerating kick in the ass in the form of a racing series.  And to test the feasibility of the idea, JPA spent the last 12 months performing tests to study how several jetpacks behave in close proximity to each other. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/8d0/717/609/8d07176095b146b28d85d6376a2ef3f1.jpg" alt="image"></div><br>  JPA recently published a video showing some episodes from these tests, and demonstrated that these devices do not seem to create serious interference with each other when pilots go for a dangerous rendezvous - provided that you do not hang directly over the other guy's head. and don't burn it with the exhaust of your own jetpack.  On the published video, you can see how Meiman stretches his hand and gives fellow test pilot Boris Jarry a playful jerk when the couple hangs over the lake. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/W-sEbI_EWXU" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br>  Thus, a series of races, it seems, has every chance to happen.  We asked Meiman about how their format might look, and he told us that for the sake of safety, the races would be held over the reservoir, with a plan to hold similar competitions on a solid surface in a couple of years. <br><br>  The overall format is likely to be similar to the Red Bull Air Race, with an emphasis on maneuverability and speed, and will require pilots to tack around special vertical pylons and perhaps some wide horizontal barriers through which they will have to fly from above and then come back from below. <br><br>  Racing with the simultaneous participation of rivals, of course, is the main goal, but the JPA has to work with the aviation authorities to make the events more ‚Äúkosher‚Äù.  Therefore, Mayman says that the racing series at first will still have the appearance of individual performances "for the best lap time", in order to demonstrate that the concept and the aircraft itself are reasonably safe. <br><br>  Teams will need at least three jet packs or similar devices to participate in races.  They will need to attract their own funding or find sponsors, and also buy or rent equipment from JPA if they do not have their own equipment.  In this case, JPA will provide pilot training and maintenance of jetpacks. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/e41/94e/47e/e4194e47ee58f36ad2978e12c012ef4c.jpg" alt="image"></div><br>  Meiman maintains contact with other developers of VTOL ( <i>vertical take-off</i> ) personal jet aircraft and hopes that the racing series can "become a place where other companies can also demonstrate their contribution to the future of transport." <br><br>  As for the audience impressions, well ... you probably want to bring earplugs!  The roar of several turbine jetpacks bursting across the sky will "sound like a group of fighters flying very close by." <br><br>  As soon as everything is ready, only the sky will be the limit for the sport with a jet pack.  Mayman says that the team experimented with sports balloons and the result was not much different from the real Quidditch game.  And he assures us that the packs are so steadily flying in close proximity to each other, that probably there should be rules for physical contact, since you can literally "jump out in front of someone from nowhere and kick him ..." <br><br>  ( <i>Approx.

Unfortunately, work in a state corporation does not always contribute to the development of initiative and creativity among young (and in other matters not young) specialists.
