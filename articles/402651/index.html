We have news - Russian scientists have successfully tested implant spongy bones on the basis of ultrahigh-molecular polyethylene (UHMWPE *): 100% of the implanted samples have successfully taken root.  Researchers from NITU "MISiS" with the help of colleagues from the Blokhin Russian Cancer Center and the State Plant of Medical Preparations learned how to create highly accurate imitations of the structure of bone tissue, which made it possible to ensure complete replacement of the bone defect, initiate bone regeneration processes and preserve the functionality of the extremities.  An article with the results of a study published in the journal "Materials Science and Engineering".  You can get acquainted with it <a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0928493116320306">here</a> . <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/f4c/987/f35/f4c987f35c68321d0d1a656d09a1a8f9.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  <i>No, this is not Hamlet.</i>  <i>This is the project manager of Ph.D.</i>  <i>Fedor Senates.</i> <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  ‚ÄúIn the course of new experiments, the research team was able to study the structural and mechanical characteristics of the samples obtained both in vitro and in vivo,‚Äù commented <b>Alevtina Chernikova, rector of NITU ‚ÄúMISiS‚Äù</b> .  ‚ÄúThanks to the close cooperation of our university, the leading oncological center of Russia and the State Plant of Medical Preparations, the breakthrough fundamental research of the scientists of NUST‚Äú MISiS ‚Äùhas received practical development.  In particular, the results of in vivo experiments made it possible to determine the degree of porosity of the inner layer and the size of pores at which there is a strong fixation in the bone defect by growing connective tissue into the implant. ‚Äù

      Partial replacement of bones destroyed by cancer, trauma or surgery remains an important medical problem.  In Russia alone, more than 70,000 operations are performed annually to restore the integrity of damaged bone tissue.  In the world of such operations are carried out hundreds of thousands. <br><br>  Bone tissue has a natural ability to regenerate, but in the case of large defects it may not be sufficient to fully restore the bone.  Therefore, today, various types of implants are used to repair damaged bone tissue.  The materials used to create bone implants must have a number of specific properties: be biologically compatible with the human or animal body, have high mechanical properties, ensure complete replacement of the bone defect and initiate the processes of bone tissue regeneration. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/973/4d2/3c3/9734d23c3b66a2fd8c482faaa22b778b.jpg" alt="image"><br>  <i>The appearance of the implants from ultrahigh molecular weight polyethylene: completely porous and hybrid (outer continuous layer, inner - porous).</i> <br><br>  Ultrahigh molecular weight polyethylene is well suited to the criteria described.  For example, if we talk about mechanical properties, then in terms of strength / dead weight of products made from UHMWPE are superior to steel.  Therefore, potentially it is very well suited for the manufacture of porous implants, the structure of which most accurately imitated porous spongy bone tissue.  However, the extremely high molecular weight of the polymer does not allow the use of traditional methods of creating a porous structure (usually they are created by foaming). <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/936/50f/d00/93650fd0037d2a1796a6ef4f58f9f669.jpg" alt="image"><br>  <i>A schematic image of a bone, into which a two-layer implant of UHMWPE is inserted (its photo is natural), in which the outer layer is solid and the inner layer is porous.</i>  <i>The microstructure of the porous layer (scanning electron microscopy) and the microstructure of the cancellous bone (scanning electron microscopy of a dog's bone) are shown.</i>  <i>It is seen that the structure is identical.</i> <br><br>  The problem was solved by applying the methods of solid-phase mixing, heat pressing and washing in subcritical water.  In this cunning way, a team of Russian scientists for the first time in the world solved the problem of imitating the complex structure of cancellous bone tissue, creating multi-layered UHMWPE frameworks (scaffold **) with a continuous outer and porous inner layer. <br><br>  ‚ÄúOur scaffold consists of two layers, firmly connected with each other,‚Äù says the <b>head of the work, the research associate of the Research Center for Composite Materials, NITU ‚ÄúMISiS‚Äù, Ph.D.</b>  <b>Fedor Senates</b> .  - The first layer is solid, it mimics the cortical bone to ensure mechanical strength.  The inner layer has pores of a certain size, so it can be colonized by the cells of the recipient in order to accelerate healing with the surrounding tissues and ensure a firm fixation of the implant in the area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe defect.
