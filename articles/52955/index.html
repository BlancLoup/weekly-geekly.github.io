Opinions diverged</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  At the first free seminar for startups from the <a href="http://egenius.ru/">Egenius.ru</a> project (AVK-Media), the loudspeakers voiced diametrically opposed principles for a successful startup startup: for how long to launch a project (2 months or 2 years), where to get sources of ideas (own creativity or adaptation of a western model) what types of advertising to choose (expensive traditional or low-budget creative), etc. <br><br>  The topic of the seminar was ‚ÄúMarketing Analysis of a Startup Idea‚Äù.  The speakers were Olesya Batog, a business developer in Pronto-Media, the head of the project <a href="http://irr.ru/">‚ÄúWebsite IRR.ru‚Äù</a> in the regions, and Akopov Ruben, the general director of LLC <a href="http://gdeetotdom.ru/">GDEETOTDOM.RU</a> . <br><br>  <b>Sources of ideas</b>

      <b>Olesya Batog:</b> Ideas are best to borrow, take working models from a foreign Internet.  In the West, a huge number of successful projects are being implemented that can and should be adapted to our realities.  Taking the already proven idea as a basis, it is much easier not only to calculate its potential, but also to convince the investor of its profitability. <br><br>  <b>Ruben Akopov:</b> Ideas need to generate their own.  No need to catch up with anyone, you need to study the market and identify unmet needs, free niches.  No need to copy Google - think up something of your own, and maybe you will be able to realize something that even they don‚Äôt have. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  <b>Marketing analysis</b> <br><br>  <b>Olesya Batog:</b> Well-established methods for assessing markets, competitors and opportunities are not the main thing.  One of the main success factors is the desire to achieve this success.  If a person is not ready to take responsibility, to develop an idea to the bitter end - he will fail, no matter how favorable the situation is. <br>  <b>Ruben Akopov:</b> Only on the basis of a comprehensive and in-depth analysis can one understand whether the idea will blow up the market, or join the ranks of startups that have not achieved success. <br><br>  <b>Startup implementation term</b> <br><br>  <b>Olesya Batog:</b> You have 2-3 months to implement the idea, not more.  The market is changing rapidly, and what you came up with a year ago may be irrelevant.  The Internet project has been living for about 4 years, so a start-up for 2 years is nonsense. <br>  <b>Ruben Akopov:</b> We have been engaged in the implementation of our startup ‚ÄúGdeetotdom.ru‚Äù for about two years, a serious exploration has gone a little more than six months ago, and now we are only planning to reach the break-even point. <br><br>  <b>Competitive environment</b> <br><br>  <b>Olesya Batog:</b> I like to study competitors.  In this way, you can think of your own successful strategy.  Competitors are those with whom you can compete.  And market leaders are your teachers, your possible partners.  You can not consider Yandex a competitor - you can (if you really try) interest them as a partner. <br>  <b>Ruben Akopov:</b> Competitors are all strong market players.  We must try to be better than them, invent services and services that they do not have.  Otherwise, your company will not develop. <br><br>  <b>Advertising</b> <br><br>  <b>Olesya Batog:</b> We live in a world full of advertising.  Giving expensive, for example, outdoor advertising, you increase advertising noise, and you practically can‚Äôt calculate the effect (if there is one at all).  It is better to concentrate on creative, focused, non-standard advertising. <br>  <b>Ruben Akopov:</b> We spend about 2 million dollars on advertising campaign, and we consider that these are reasonable costs.  We entered the highly competitive market, where no one wanted to see us and did not take us seriously.  With help.  radio advertising, we managed to achieve excellent performance on daily site traffic, and using outdoor advertising, we showed the seriousness of our project for advertisers. <br><br>  <b>Internet project is ...</b> <br><br>  <b>Olesya Batog:</b> We all sell air.  We sell the image, sell our virtual projects.  Internet projects require huge mental and financial investments, bring real money, but do not produce anything. <br>  <b>Ruben Akopov:</b> We do not sell air.  We sell advertising space, we sell new customers to our advertisers.  We sell the success of their business. <br><habracut><br><br>  Seminar videos and presentations of speakers <a href="http://egenius.ru/seminar/arc.php%3Fcid%3D2">here</a> <br>  PS At the next seminar we will discuss the problem of managing a startup team.  Speakers are specified.  This time we will have a normal sound on the broadcast, a good presentation of the presentation on the screen, and the speakers will be strictly limited in time.  (In general, we will take into account all the mistakes of the first seminar) </habracut></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/52955/">https://habr.com/ru/post/52955/</a></p>
