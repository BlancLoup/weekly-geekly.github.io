In this topic, we will hold for our readers a photo tour of the Foundation office, accelerator and coworking.  Kirill Varlamov, director of the Foundation, <a href="http://lenta.ru/articles/2014/10/21/varlamov/">believes</a> that Russian start-ups should be comfortable at home - this, or rather, the physical component of comfort, will be discussed in today's post. <br><br>  <b>PS Caution ~ 30mb pictures under the cut.</b> <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h4>  Fund </h4><br>  FRII City (actually, the FRIA office and accelerator, as well as co-working) are located in the <a href="https://www.google.ru/maps/place/Silver%2BCity,%2B%25D0%25B1%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B7%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B5%25D1%2581-%25D1%2586%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BD%25D1%2582%25D1%2580/%4055.750518,37.654133,17z/data%3D!3m1!4b1!4m2!3m1!1s0x46b54af2761a2e63:0xddfc1bac565f12fa">business center Silver City</a> (Kurskaya metro station).  This is how the business center looks from the inside (in addition to IIDF, there are about a dozen other companies, a gym and a small coffee shop in the atrium of the business center):

At first glance, it seems that fully decorating the walls of such a rather large space with artistic painting (a total of 3,000 square meters of the Foundation‚Äôs premises) is a titanic task.  Not only are there really a lot of drawings, but they also differ by subject: for example, coworking walls are decorated with sketches of various sports, the Foundation and accelerator negotiations are decorated according to the names. <br><br>  Moreover, for the meeting rooms of the Foundation‚Äôs office, the emphasis in the titles (and, accordingly, in the design) is on creating a relaxed atmosphere, conducive to thinking: ‚ÄúMusic Studio‚Äù, ‚ÄúSquare‚Äù, ‚ÄúLibrary‚Äù.  But for the negotiating accelerator, the names were chosen to be underlinedly dynamic: ‚ÄúAirport‚Äù, ‚ÄúStation‚Äù, ‚ÄúCrossroads‚Äù - all these nuances needed to be captured and conveyed when painting rooms so that they tuned to the selected wave.  And <a href="http://stenografika.ru/rospis-sten/">artists</a> Vlad Vasilyev and Anton Dolgov coped with the task perfectly well.  It took them only a month to decorate the premises, although artists sometimes had to spend the night right in the workplace - at the IIDF office. <br><br>  Murals on the walls of the FRIA office: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/646/84e/39f/64684e39ff654c1a825d5030fd4626b1.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/ffe/e3e/43c/ffee3e43c6fb493fb033a275a8440426.jpg"><br><br>  Painting on one of the walls of coworking: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/aff/3f8/7da/aff3f87daea74fc58b3b98bda402fb80.jpg"><br><br>  The design of the IIDF negotiations fully corresponds to the name - it is impossible to make a mistake when searching for a planned meeting place. <br><br>  "Music Studio" (negotiation office of the Foundation): <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/346/915/861/346915861af6438aa8fbd262da59a547.jpg"><br><br>  ‚ÄúLibrary‚Äù (negotiation of the Fund‚Äôs office): <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/b8d/8b5/8b3/b8d8b58b30bd40148421ceafea475ba5.jpg"><br><br>  "Station" (negotiation accelerator FRIA): <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/943/6ad/4ec/9436ad4ecd1e467598cf58584065d462.jpg"><br><br>  There is even a micro-gym in the Foundation premises - a horizontal bar.  They installed it at the end of one of the corridors at a distance from the negotiating and workplaces - you can calmly warm up without disturbing anyone. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/434/4b9/94c/4344b994c3c049ce8465d431fea0c645.jpg"><br><br>  The permanent resident of the Foundation‚Äôs office is the Startup cat.  After the appearance in the group IID in social.  Odnoklassniki networks of the hero of the group - owls Frinyashi, the team of the Foundation is thinking about acquiring a real live little friend.  The choice was stopped on the cat.  The name for the pet was born instantly, but the breed was chosen for a long time - as a result, they decided to purchase a Scot. <br><br>  A few days before the appearance of a cat in the office, the first persons of the Foundation announced that they had invested in a startup (it would be better to say in a Startup) that no one else has.  <a href="https://vk.com/friifond%3Fw%3Dwall-55533849_5897">The publications</a> greatly stimulated the interest of the public - and the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/friifond/posts/772700902740043">post</a> about the cat became one of the most popular in the entire history of the IIDF in social networks (for our photo, Startup had to interrupt lunch - he was unhappy, but he worked the photo session like a real professional). <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/29e/911/aa2/29e911aa2de94a07b105fcf0163f9cfb.jpg"><br><br>  The office of the Foundation is designed for 80 people - the employees work in an environment of pleasant trifles that tune in to the working atmosphere. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/3eb/da4/c41/3ebda4c41abf405bbbc7647989904b7b.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/93d/b1f/af1/93db1faf17e14b2796e7fa8d72ca3201.jpg"><br><br>  And at rest, employees, if desired, can go to the shower (in combination with a horizontal bar, you get an excellent combo to maintain a healthy lifestyle without leaving the office). <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/7f2/284/a31/7f2284a31471403083c8bc262c1b29e9.jpg" width="500"><br><br><h4>  Accelerator </h4><br>  Accelerator FRIA - a large open space, designed for 40 teams.  The entrance to the accelerator is preceded by another thematic painting. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/e1a/626/6e4/e1a6266e43d14897bf187e674edbd95f.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/fa8/6fc/e79/fa86fce792be43038e09263b907519a7.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/267/8f8/225/2678f822539747bc982761c76d72ba82.jpg"><br><br>  Teams undergoing acceleration have access to small meeting rooms - ‚Äútelephone booths‚Äù with comfortable ottomans and excellent sound insulation. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/049/9f2/f98/0499f2f9888949c8afa801f06ddb21c9.jpg" width="500"><br><br>  The accelerator's kitchen is a roomy enough room compared to typical office kitchens - if you want, you can warm up lunch there, drink tea, talk with colleagues, and do not interfere with anyone or push. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/2b1/a4d/b8a/2b1a4db8a41844cbb5ce6b1b852c85ab.jpg"><br><br>  And for those who literally burn all day at work, it is possible to spend the night without leaving the office - this is a special room for sleeping.  There is a sign on her door warning visitors that you need to be as quiet as possible when entering there - there is a chance that someone is already resting there. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/73c/a89/d94/73ca89d946ee4546a444d16d443320da.jpg"><br><br>  In the mini-accelerator lectures, traction meetings, master classes, trainings and meetings with experts are held. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/9d9/8bb/7fd/9d98bb7fdb5445f5b65b42ffb8ff437f.jpg"><br><br><h4>  Coworking </h4><br>  At the entrance to the FRIA coworking, where the space for startups #tceh is located, you will be greeted by a small Master Yoda, and with it by the administrators who will help you to stay in coworking and answer all questions. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/827/0aa/175/8270aa17546e473a9bfa7be2fc887133.jpg"><br><br>  In addition to the coworking jobs, there is a lounge area with board games and a ‚Äúbookshelf‚Äù with bestsellers from business literature, programming, and design ‚Äî a list that may not be exhaustive, but nonetheless useful. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/64f/19b/19b/64f19b19b0c54787b9eedd6b814c70c1.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/0fb/9f8/b79/0fb9f8b79f2049148babccaca1f75fbe.jpg"><br><br>  Coworking capacity - 200 people.  There is a small kitchen, meeting rooms and a punching bag - all for creating a pleasant atmosphere of openness and productive work. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/369/24d/910/36924d910f344e5e84b5bdd4b7ff3464.jpg"><br><br>  In addition to the Foundation‚Äôs office, accelerator and coworking, FRII also has a separate platform on the first floor of the business center - City Hall.  This is a multimedia conference room with a capacity of 250 people, where all major events of the Foundation take place.  There, for example, an open futurological session ‚ÄúKey trends in Internet development‚Äù was held at the Internet Entrepreneurship Forum in Russia, awarding the prize ‚ÄúPRotail‚Äù for the most interesting achievements in the world of PR, master classes and events from #tceh.  In addition, every 3 months, new accelerator training is being taught there. <br><br>  We invite everyone to a tour of <a href="http://tceh.com/">#tceh</a> and City Hall, and do not forget to follow our <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/friifond/">blog</a> on Habr√©! </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/362205/">https://habr.com/ru/post/362205/</a></p>
