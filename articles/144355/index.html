    <h4>  Prehistory </h4><br>  In my head there were always a lot of ideas from various projects.  In my spare time, I loved drawing interfaces of non-existent services, thinking through the structure and business model (by the way, it trains brains very well, by the way).  But since I didn‚Äôt have a team or even just a programmer, all projects remained just layouts in a folder. <br><br>  From time to time I thought that it would be nice to check this or that idea for relevance - to create some kind of promotional page on which the interested user could leave his e-mail. <br>  The advantages are obvious - the sooner you tell others about your idea, the sooner you will understand whether such a project is needed at all. <br><br>  But I am not a programmer and not a typesetter at all, and even making such a simple page is difficult for me. <br><br>  And then came up with the idea that it would be nice to make a service that would help such as me. <br><br>  He began to actively look for similar services - nothing interesting was found on the expanses of the Russian Internet, but <a href="http://launchrock.com/">LaunchRock</a> and <a href="http://kickofflabs.com/">Kickoff labs</a> were found <a href="http://launchrock.com/">across the</a> ocean.  The projects are great, but there are ideas how to make it even better.  And it is always more pleasant to use Russified services. <br><br>  In the same breath, I drew a prototype of the project, and in just a month a great programmer turned up, with whom we are working today, and not only on underconstruct.me. <br><br><h4>  Benefits </h4><br>  What specifically gives you the use of underconstruct.me is the opportunity to create a promotional page for your project (or just ideas) in 15-20 minutes and immediately track the number of interested users, and if you want, start communicating with them. <br><br>  There are quite a lot of settings in the service, the whole structure is divided into the ‚ÄúMain page‚Äù and ‚ÄúDispatch page‚Äù (what the user sees, leaving his e-mail in the form). <br><br>  But let's go a little more concretely on each step of creating your promotional page. <br><br><h5>  Home page </h5><br>  On the main page you can play around with the settings of the main unit, without fail, upload a logo, a beautiful background and, of course, favicon. <br>  There are three fields for project description.  If you don‚Äôt need any of them, you can safely turn them off. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/761/c51/da0/761c51da0ace0fe84e740c20f1efcdb9.png" alt="image"><br><br><h5>  Widgets </h5><br>  If you purchased any tariff above the ‚Äúbase‚Äù, then widgets will become available to you.  There are not many of them yet, just two - a video insertion widget (youtube, vimeo, VKontakte are supported) or presentations from slideshare, as well as a countdown widget until the project starts. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/7ac/070/71a/7ac07071a13ec45dbcdb3c300df1d7c7.png" alt="image"><br><br><h5>  Submit page </h5><br>  As mentioned above, this is the page that the user sees, who left his e-mail in the form. <br>  On this page, you can enable or disable the social services sharing buttons you need and customize some of them (for example, by clicking on the twitter icon you can edit the text that will be published when sharing). <br>  If you have accounts in social networks, be sure to include them and they will also be reflected on the submission page. <br><br>  And of course, do not forget to edit the motivating text so that people actively invite their friends (for example, promise that everyone who invited 5 friends has a 10% discount on the use of the service). <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/11c/cd0/db9/11ccd0db99069e7659a5fa2a3751096c.png" alt="image"><br><br><h5>  Sending letters </h5><br>  You can edit the text of the letter that comes to everyone subscribing to your project. <br>  In it, you can tell at what stage of development the project is located, and can even immediately send a link to the beta version of the project. <br>  What really you fantasy enough. <br><br><h5>  Statistics </h5><br>  In the statistics section, you can track the number of subscribers to your project, see the growth dynamics of subscribers, estimate interest in the project using the percentage of conversion and track the most active users. <br>  Those who invited the most friends can be given various bonuses or just to communicate with them. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/2ea/eef/2bc/2eaeef2bc30b3f5924bab2054215c6e2.png" alt="image"><br><br><h5>  Launch </h5><br>  You can start the page in two ways - either you can attach a domain as usual, or you can use the opportunity to receive a code for insertion. <br><br>  When choosing the second option, you can enable / disable the required fields and embed the form in the form that you need. <br><br>  These two options can be used together - attach a domain (or several) and place the code for insertion, for example, in your blog, attracting additional users. <br><br><h4>  Future plans </h4><br>  In order to make less gestures when creating a promotional page, we want to introduce a mailing service to us. <br>  At the moment, you can simply download the email addresses of subscribers in CSV format and upload them to the usual MailChimp or UniSender. <br><br>  One-way new and new widgets will be developed so that you can make your promotional page more individual. <br><br>  We are thinking of screwing a tool to attract traffic to your promo page.  We begin to negotiate with some advertising systems. <br><br>  The possibility of using the mobile version of the promotional page will be developed. <br><br>  Without fail we plan to do localization.  First of all, of course, in English. <br><br><h4>  Success stories </h4><br>  Although we have not really started yet, but we already have examples of the successful use of our service. <br>  <a href="http://beta.seriestrack.ru/">Seriestrack.ru</a> is a service where you can find songs from popular TV shows. <br><br>  In just over a month, the guys managed to collect a base of 880 subscribers and attract about 80 people to their VKontakte group. <br><br>  In addition to them, we have about a dozen clients, some of them already use paid accounts. <br><br><iframe src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://player.vimeo.com/video/42539771&amp;xid=17259,15700023,15700186,15700190,15700253,15700256,15700259&amp;usg=ALkJrhiO522eAJB4wmG8ILUxfZ-RGEDPPA" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0" title="Underconstruct.me | Promotion site creation service" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  If your entire team is in the wild, and you need to quickly launch a project's promotional page, or you just want to test your idea, then use <a href="http://underconstruct.me/">Underconstruct.me</a> . </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/144355/">https://habr.com/ru/post/144355/</a></p>
