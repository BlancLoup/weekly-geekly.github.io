      In one of the lectures, the business section called ‚ÄúEntrepreneurship, Incubation and Venture Capital‚Äù shared with us the secrets of attracting venture capital Don Dodge from Google, Alex Bakman from Snappii and Alexander Galitsky from Almaz Capital Partners. <br><br>  According to the speakers, first of all, you need to decide how much you want to change the world.  Someone likes to work in a small company, and someone wants to create a large corporation.  If you have a brilliant idea, but no experience, then the chance to get investment tends to zero. <br><br>  Also, it is important to remember that today it is not the one who produces the best product that survives in the world, but the one who is able to adapt to the conditions of a changing market.  The best ideas are the ideas that the market confirms.  A business that starts from scratch will take many years to achieve something.  Therefore, venture capitalism assumes that it will provide a service for building the foundations of a business.  Do not forget that venture capitalists do not lend money. <br><br>  If you have an idea or a project, then Alexander Galitsky recommends making a presentation of several slides for an investor and not wasting time on a business plan.  At the same time, it should be borne in mind that if the money is not taken from a venture capitalist, then the company will have more flexibility.  Sometimes a small venture capital is given out under one simple condition that you will find another investor who you can convince to invest the same amount in your project.  If the investor liked your presentation, you need to make a list of questions and expectations from the investor.  If there is mutual love, then there is further verification of all data from the project presentation. <br><br>  The first place where you can and should find money is the buyers of your product, not the venture capitalists.  But if you decide that you need to find money, then you should know that venture capital is not the only place where you can find it.  Business angels will give less money, but conditions will not be so tough. <br><br>  Do not make a company for sale - this is the wrong strategy! <br><br>  These are the tips from business representatives and venture capital fund. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/130203/">https://habr.com/ru/post/130203/</a></p>
