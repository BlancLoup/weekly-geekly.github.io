      They can not but rejoice at the pace of development of network communications capabilities.  More recently, in addition to the phone, we had no normal alternative to talk to someone from another point on the planet.  But chattering is a chatter, but to see a distant interlocutor during a conversation is quite another.  And if earlier only presidents and astronauts had the possibility of video calling, now, in an era of rapid drops in the price of traffic, we have the opportunity to communicate as many as you want and with anyone.  It remains to determine the means of communication;). <br><br>  Actually, all that is needed for a video call through the network is a quick connection, a computer and a webcam.  And if with the first two points, all of them have highly individual solutions and approaches, here is usually no one seriously considering choosing a webcam.  And in vain, because the camera is different. <br><br>  Not long ago, when I didn‚Äôt have a webcam (there was no need), I thought that they were ordinary cameras connected to a computer, giving photos close to the photographic one.  As it soon turned out, this is not entirely true, and it is not always possible to believe beautiful pictures from boxes and Internet sites. <br><br>  Although I am typing fast enough, sometimes it happens that it would be much more correct to call in order to solve a question much faster.  Well, or if it's not about speed, but about emotions, then ICQ-mail is also not so suitable.  Constant questions ‚ÄúHave skype with a camera?‚Äù I was forced to ask a solution to this question, which I actually did. <br><br>  Today, on my best-looking battlefield, six completely different webcams.  They differ not only in appearance, but also in capabilities, image quality, price, etc. <br>  Why these devices?  In order not to say that the light came together only on the log house)) In general, what was found was tested. <br><br><h3>  Battle participants </h3><br>  So, meet: <br>  - <b>Philips SPC620NC</b> <br>  - <b>Philips SPC315NC</b> <br>  - <b>Logitech QuickCam E2500</b> <br>  - <b>Logitech QuickCam Vision Pro</b> <br>  - <b>Labtec Webcam 1200</b> <br>  - <b>Labtec Webcam 2200</b> <br><br><img src="http://boomburum.ru/wp-content/uploads/2009/06/11.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  I take out units from the boxes. <br><br><h3>  Philips SPC620NC </h3><br>  Camera with a 1.3 megapixel matrix (photos and videos), capable of shooting video at 30 frames per second. <br><br><img src="http://boomburum.ru/wp-content/uploads/2009/06/620.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Inside the box are: <br>  - Webcam <b><a href="http://www.consumer.philips.com/consumer/en/sg/consumer/cc/_productid_SPC620NC_00_SG_CONSUMER/Webcam%2BSPC620NC-00">Philips SPC620NC</a></b> with a non-removable USB-cord 1.5m long; <br>  - Installation disk; <br>  - Color-turn manual with pictures in 6 languages ‚Äã‚Äã(without Russian). <br><br>  The camera rotates not just 360 degrees - even more (but already with a wire winding).  The vertical tilt angle is approximately 60 degrees. <br>  Around the lens rotating ring with notches - for manual adjustment of the focus.  Top unsigned button that takes a picture.  Above the orange-red indicator, bright enough. <br>  Camera with microphone, mounted on a rubberized clothespin.  Clothespin reveals 90 degrees.  Can only be fixed on a horizontal surface (on the monitor) and that is not very reliable.  On the table is worth more confident. <br><br>  If autorun discs are not disabled, when you insert a disc into the drive, the installation of the software starts immediately, where the system language is already selected.  If you prefer, you can put only the driver (although everything worked on Skype without it), or additionally help and software (Vlounge).  Included is the software version 1.0.0.75, although the site has 1.0.0.79 available - absolutely no difference, but it‚Äôs still without Russian. <br><br>  I launch the program - it is quite slow.  The whole program can be divided into 2 parts - upper and lower.  The bottom image is always displayed from the camera, above - settings.  At the top left are 5 menu items ‚Äî <b>File</b> , <b>Edit</b> , <b>Preferences</b> , <b>Links</b> , <b>Help,</b> and 4 tabs ‚Äî <b>Capture</b> , <b>Communicate</b> , <b>Monitor,</b> and <b>Broadcast</b> . <br><br>  Menu items can not be considered - standard printing operations, cut-paste, an indication of the directory where everything will be saved ... and all. <br><br><img src="http://boomburum.ru/wp-content/uploads/2009/06/620-4.png" alt="image"><br><br>  On the <b>Capture</b> tab, as you already guessed, an image is captured - a photo or video.  The upper part displays what is already captured.  You can also make a slideshow of frames, rotate them 90-180-270 degrees, print, send by mail or delete. <br><br><img src="http://boomburum.ru/wp-content/uploads/2009/06/620-5.png" alt="image"><br><br>  The second tab ( <b>Communicate</b> ) lists the supported communication programs - Skype, MSN, Yahoo, QQ and AIM.  If this software is already installed - you can run it;  otherwise download. <br><br>  The next tab in the list is <b>Monitor</b> . <br><br><img src="http://boomburum.ru/wp-content/uploads/2009/06/620-monitor.png" alt="image"><br><br>  By adjusting the sensitivity of the camera to movement, you can record either everything in a row, or only the violent activity that the sensor will notice.  By the way, it is very sensitive.  At a distance of a meter, the camera turned on the recording, if I started to slowly cover my eyes <br>  Also in the camera there is an opportunity to ‚Äúfollow‚Äù the head of a person.  It looks like this: <br><br><iframe width="420" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/XXfClbTRdNo%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=25657,15700002,15700021,15700186,15700191,15700253,15700256,15700259&amp;usg=ALkJrhjUFfSewn99l-8Msy-nJ-x1HC2_tg" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  There is really nothing on the last tab - a couple of icons and a link to the website <a href="http://www.ww.com/">www.ww.com</a> , through which you can make a simple broadcast.  On the lover. <br><br>  The image is often quite dark and noisy (with a high interpolated resolution).  But for the same Skype - it itself, for almost without delay (although in the dark they are palpable).  The only thing that I could not do from the documented features was to replace the background.  In theory, it should be this way - I chose a picture of Mars or a desert and the camera itself puts it on the background to deceive the interlocutor) But something none of the software versions provided me with this opportunity, although it is mentioned on the box that it is. <br><br>  I liked the detailed illustrated manual for the camera. <br><br><h3>  Philips SPC315NC </h3><br>  In the box was: <br>  - Webcam <b>Philips SPC315NC</b> ; <br>  - Headset; <br>  - 7 manuals in 12 languages ‚Äã‚Äã- Russian, as always, no; <br>  - Disk with drivers; <br>  - Advertise Skype and warranty. <br><br><img src="http://boomburum.ru/wp-content/uploads/2009/06/315.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  0.1 megapixel camera (1.3MP with interpolation) silver, with a long (2m) non-removable USB-wire. <br>  The camera cannot turn left and right - only up and down (approximately 70 degrees).  If you lift the lens up as much as possible, you will not see the blue indicator, which is located directly above the "eye".  On the sides there are two buttons - a photo and something else) On the fasteners - rubber inserts.  It is possible to fix it, but also very reliably - rather, only ‚Äúhang‚Äù. <br>  The camera is heavily recessed in the case, because of what the thought immediately appears that there will not be enough light, which means the image will be dark.  And so it happened when checking - the default image is very dark and noisy.  Pokold regular means can be a little, but the "candy" is still not done - everything is limited initially. <br><br>  Headset  Very reminiscent of headphones, but they are not quite - the left is, and instead of the right - rubberized insert, providing the necessary friction about the ear) <br>  The microphone is rotated vertically by about 150 degrees, ‚Äústepwise‚Äù, with a small step.  The sound is enough to chat on Skype. <br><br>  Regarding the software - the same as in the previous case, except that now it became possible to adjust the quality of the image in the manner described in the manual.  But instead, lost two tabs - Monitor and Broadcast. <br><br><h3>  Logitech QuickCam E2500 </h3><br>  A 0.3 megapixel camera that allows you to produce a 1.3 megapixel interpolated image. <br>  Allows you to shoot video in 640x480 resolution, 30 frames per second. <br><br><img src="http://boomburum.ru/wp-content/uploads/2009/06/2500.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  In the box: <br>  - Webcam <a href="http://www.logitech.com/index.cfm/webcam_communications/webcams/devices/4266%26cl%3Dru,ru"><b>Logitech QuickCam E2500</b></a> ; <br>  - Black-and-white manual (150 pages) in 15 languages, including Russian; <br>  - CD with software; <br>  - Warranty for 2 years. <br><br>  The camera is round, the lens is deeply hidden.  USB cable extends to 1.8m. <br>  There is a shooting button on the back (which makes it almost unpressed, especially if the camera is set ‚Äúin position‚Äù on the table);  just above the button is a microphone. <br>  Immediately above the lens is a bright green LED and company logo (where can it go without it).  Ring around the lens - to adjust the focus. <br>  The "eye" is very quirky - it rotates 360 degrees horizontally, while you can twist it up and down about 60 degrees. <br><br>  The installation is very original, there is no Russian language (even in the era of colliders, it is quite difficult to know about the existence of the largest (by area and ambitions) state). <br>  You can put only firewood or wood and software. <br>  After installation, a window appears for reference, which can teach you how to use the camera.  For the sake of interest, I clicked on one of the points - I threw it on the site, where <a href="http://www.logitech.com/index.cfm/webcam_communications/video_software_services/%26section%3Dmotion_detection">detailed videos</a> are recorded.  Yes, with such support, my granny would have mastered a webcam). <br><br>  I run the software - there is a very small vertical control panel, which, if desired, can be further reduced. <br><br>  It is possible to shoot videos directly on youtube.  I liked that through the program you can turn off either the sound from the camera or the image, leaving the sound.  Either turn off both of these by displaying various photos on your screen, the range of which can be set in the settings (Privacy Shade). <br><br>  There are 10 different effects that can be used to distort an already not the best picture.  What for?  Apparently, all sorts of paranoia wanted it) However, sometimes funny moments happen.  I liked the effect of ‚Äúaging‚Äù of the image ... well, and ‚ÄúI see a ghost‚Äù. <br><br><img src="http://boomburum.ru/wp-content/uploads/2009/06/e2500.png" alt="image"><br><br>  The settings for <b>Low Light Boost</b> and <b>Color Boost</b> slightly improve the picture quality, but still it‚Äôs far from perfect. <br>  Initially, the image in white, a little noisy.  There is a delay, and a tangible one - by opening your eyes, you can see yourself for a moment with your eyes closed. <br><br><img src="http://boomburum.ru/wp-content/uploads/2009/06/e2500-3.png" alt="image"><br><br>  The image can be mirrored both vertically (if the camera hangs "upside down") or horizontally (for those who are used to seeing themselves in the usual mirror image) <br><br>  As I said, a button on the camera can take pictures - I was pleasantly surprised by the ‚Äúrate of fire‚Äù. <br><br><h3>  Logitech QuickCam Vision Pro </h3><br>  In the box you can find: <br>  - <b><a href="http://www.logitech.com/index.cfm/webcam_communications/webcams/devices/3056%26cl%3Dru,ru">Webcam Logitech QuickCam Vision Pro</a></b> ; <br>  - Black-green manual (70 pages) in 16 languages; <br>  - Warranty for 2 years. <br><br><img src="http://boomburum.ru/wp-content/uploads/2009/06/vision.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Two-megapixel camera with <b><a href="http://www.logitech.com/index.cfm/69/3231%26cl%3Dru,ru">Carl Zeiss</a></b> optics and chic autofocus. <br>  Appearance is very unusual.  The large microphone on the right has a spherical shape and conveys excellent sound quality to the other person.  Around the lens is a metal ring that gives glare in bright light. <br>  The camera can not only be fixed to the monitor, but also put on several ways on the table - the design is very stable.  True, the degrees of freedom of the "head" are very few - 60 degrees up and down and that's it. <br><br><img src="http://boomburum.ru/wp-content/uploads/2009/06/vision-pro2.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  To the left of the lens is an unsigned button for taking pictures.  To the right of the lens is a chrome insert with a logo, around which a ring glows with a pleasant white color.  Very so unobtrusive (only in active mode), not bright and beautifully coming out. <br><br><img src="http://boomburum.ru/wp-content/uploads/2009/06/logiring.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  USB-wire is also non-removable, length - 1.8m. <br><br>  It is a pity, but this camera is only for lucky owners of Macs - there are no drivers for Windows.  However, you can find a way out of this situation - install the drivers from the <b>QuickCam Pro 9000</b> camera (it looks exactly the same) - 28.5 megs (only XP and Vista) and it will work.  True, with this solution, many camera settings will remain inaccessible, but without them you can work comfortably. <br><br>  There is no countdown in the software when you shoot a video with a time limit (for example, 30 seconds).  It was also personally inconvenient for me that the photographs were numbered as follows: I did, for example, three frames - 1, 2, 3. If you move them to another folder, then in their place instead of pictures 4, 5, 6 ... pictures with numbers 1, 2, 3 will be created. <br><br>  Do not think, but as always ... almost nothing to complain about.  Excellent video quality - color reproduction, minimal noise, even in low light;  There are almost no delays, everything is in focus.  A pair of photos (in different lighting conditions) in NOT-maximum quality (960 √ó 720): <br><br><img src="http://boomburum.ru/wp-content/uploads/2009/06/picture-7.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><img src="http://boomburum.ru/wp-content/uploads/2009/06/picture-8.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  If you bring a book to the camera, then at that ‚Äúend of the wire‚Äù you can read it if you wish :) <br><br><img src="http://boomburum.ru/wp-content/uploads/2009/06/4umak.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  The only device on the image with which Skype responded "Wow, what kind of camera?".  Well, I also understood a lot, looking at the ‚Äúimages‚Äù from the cameras of my interlocutors. <br><br><img src="http://boomburum.ru/wp-content/uploads/2009/06/vision-pro.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Video example: <br><iframe width="420" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/4rm2V1O_y28%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=25657,15700002,15700021,15700186,15700191,15700253,15700256,15700259&amp;usg=ALkJrhhzPOKLec_57zrm68OM4fBZUmG_Qg" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br><h4>  A little bit about QuickCam </h4><br>  It is quite simple, but at the same time, it has almost everything you need.  At the same time, such an important detail as the usability has been preserved. <br>  So, after launching the program, it is a small socket with one button - for working with photos and videos.  The panel can be expanded by clicking on the triangle below - the setup and help buttons will appear. <br><br><img src="http://boomburum.ru/wp-content/uploads/2009/06/quickcam.png" alt="image"><br><br>  The settings are very diverse, but vary depending on which camera is connected.  Depending on the same, the appearance of the main panel also changes - new buttons may be added, such as effects. <br><br><img src="http://boomburum.ru/wp-content/uploads/2009/06/quickcam2.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  The window for working with photos and videos is primitive to horror - the place where the image is displayed, below there are two tabs (oddly enough, this is a photo and video).  When you click on the first, oddly enough, a place appears with all the photos taken.  When you click on the second, oddly enough ... yes, the footage Vidic.  Double-click to view these files in associated programs.  Pictures can be sent by mail, print, delete.  There are a couple of settings, such as time stamps, photo-video quality, time delays, etc. <br><br><h3>  Labtec Webcam 1200/2200 </h3><br>  In the boxes - on the camera, disk with firewood, software and instructions, warranty for 2 years. <br>  These two cameras can be described as one, since  they are virtually indistinguishable (externally - only in color).  And to me personally, the black and red color is more pleasant) Strange, I thought that once black, it means that everything is more serious and the model is older, but no - black is model 1200, blue is 2200. <br><br><img src="http://boomburum.ru/wp-content/uploads/2009/06/labtec.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  The most ‚Äúfree‚Äù cameras - due to the hinge mechanism, we have the ability to rotate 360 ‚Äã‚Äãdegrees around its axis and good deviations up and down. <br>  And due to the fact that the very mount of the camera is held in the slot of the stand, we can still move the camera back and forth.  On top of the camera is a button for creating photos, below it (above the lens) is a small LED (green, not very bright).  Around the "eyes" - a ring for sharpening.  The camera 2200 has a built-in microphone, in 1200 it is not. <br><br><img src="http://boomburum.ru/wp-content/uploads/2009/06/labtec-2.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Build quality?  Very good, but personally I am not a fan of half-millimeter distances between the details of the case (this is not a marriage, so it is intended).  And yet, everything is very good - no burrs, squeaks and other defects.  On the sides of the camera are nice elongated embossed inserts. <br><br>  Drivers weigh about 7 MB.  Russian language what?  That's right, either.  Install, connect the camera, run.  Intuitive interface software does not stand out.  A window appears with an image (640x480). <br>  It is not very good in quality - yellow-green colors prevail, slight noise and some strange vertical stripes (no, they are barely visible, but visible).  The image itself is quite clear (if you twist the focus ring). <br><br>  Image from <b>Labtec Webcam 1200</b> : <br><img src="http://boomburum.ru/wp-content/uploads/2009/06/labtec3.png" alt="image"><br><br>  Image from <b>Labtec Webcam 2200</b> : <br><img src="http://boomburum.ru/wp-content/uploads/2009/06/labtec.png" alt="image"><br><br>  In the presence of a dozen different effects, come across very interesting. <br><img src="http://boomburum.ru/wp-content/uploads/2009/06/labtec2.png" alt="image"><br><br>  What is interesting - webcams earned in the program from Philips (Vlounge). <br><br><h3>  Battle :) </h3><br><img src="http://boomburum.ru/wp-content/uploads/2009/06/cam1.jpg" alt="image"><br><img src="http://boomburum.ru/wp-content/uploads/2009/06/cam2.jpg" alt="image"><br><img src="http://boomburum.ru/wp-content/uploads/2009/06/cam3.jpg" alt="image"><br><img src="http://boomburum.ru/wp-content/uploads/2009/06/cam4.jpg" alt="image"><br><img src="http://boomburum.ru/wp-content/uploads/2009/06/cam5.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><h3>  Total </h3><br>  Having tested all these cameras, I came to the conclusion that not a single camera will provide a photographic image, what we would like to see and what we mentally mean to ourselves.  10 points out of 10 do not get anyone :) Therefore, keep this in mind in advance so that you do not get disappointed.  On the other hand, I do not understand - now almost all the phones have cameras (as an option), and the images from them are very good.  A webcam is a device designed for the sole purpose ... <br><br>  The only camera that met my expectations from this type of device was Logitech QuickCam Vision Pro - the image is always clear, the color reproduction is high, the delays are minimal.  If she had the opportunity to turn left and right, full-fledged work in Windows (although I‚Äôm sure this is in the QuickCam Pro 9000 camera) and an adequate price would be 10 points. <br>  All other cameras have some defects - noise, delays, darkness of the image. <br><br>  Despite such conclusions - any of these cameras (except, perhaps, Labtec Webcam 1200 - it is without a microphone) is suitable for video chatting on Skype and similar systems.  Connection, setup - even a novice computer user can handle all this.  So, if you plan to see the interlocutor, you will see him) <br><br>  The result of the fight: <br><img src="http://boomburum.ru/wp-content/uploads/2009/06/table.png" alt="image"><br><br><img src="http://boomburum.ru/wp-content/uploads/2009/06/z.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  <b>From Friday and happy holiday.</b>  <b>Successes!</b> <br><br>  ps I am looking for an interesting job. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/61962/">https://habr.com/ru/post/61962/</a></p>
