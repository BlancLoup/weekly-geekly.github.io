  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Features of the analysis of CRM systems in the restaurant business</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  To this day, many analysts and leading marketers in the restaurant segment continue to pay attention to the features of Internet marketing, as the main tool for working with CRM.  We propose to take a fresh look at technologies that are already actively supplanting the so-called marketing email "spam". <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Today, in open access, we can observe how inexperienced marketers and middle managers offer extremely inefficient ways to win customers, attract guests with the help of various bonuses and loyal conditions.  After all, who would have thought that they were waiting for a boring and uninteresting email-list, which will soon be in the spam folder. <br><br>  The standard and outdated e-mail marketing scheme looks like this: <br><br><ol><li>  all familiar form of subscription to the newsletter and an interesting bonus; </li><li>  preparing email newsletters; </li><li>  Attractive information about the motivation for action. </li></ol><br>  Cons of this approach: 
      <br>
        <script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>
        <ins class="adsbygoogle"
          style="display:block; text-align:center;"
          data-ad-layout="in-article"
          data-ad-format="fluid"
          data-ad-client="ca-pub-6974184241884155"
          data-ad-slot="8945601208"></ins>
        <script>
          (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
        </script>
      <br>
    <ul><li>  the user must go to the site to see the subscription form; </li><li>  bonus, which is offered in exchange for a subscription is not personalized and does not take into account the preferences of visitors to the site; </li><li>  users regard most of the mailings received as spam and do not open the letter; </li><li>  of a small percentage of those who still open the received letter, only a few go to the site, or perform another action, which was the purpose of the mailing. </li></ul><br>  In the era of mobile technology, the site ceases to be a convenient tool for informing users.  Trends are such that mobile applications have learned to present users with the necessary information in a more convenient format.  And since device memory is limited, specialized aggregator applications are becoming increasingly popular. <br><br>  And so, what has come to replace outdated mailings?  What tools can fully meet the expectations of chain restaurants and not only, and build an effective CRM system? <br><br><h4>  Push notifications as an effective internet marketing tool </h4><br>  Push notifications of any events or news have long become the norm of the modern world.  Some banks have already refused SMS messages in favor of PUSH notifications.  This approach allows not only to reduce the cost of sending SMS, but also to popularize a mobile application that displays a PUSH notification. <br><br>  Given the specifics of the restaurant business, where the main task is to attract a guest to the institution and increase its average bill, you can use PUSH notifications as follows: <br><br><ul><li>  inform guests about the new menu; </li><li>  offer guests discounts and promotions. </li></ul><br>  In order for the guest to receive a PUSH notification on his phone, it is necessary that the user has an application installed that will both receive and show the PUSH notification. <br><br>  If the restaurant wants to have its own mobile application, you can use it to inform your guests and forget about the useless e-mail newsletters, but here the institution faces several problems: <br><br><ul><li>  the restaurant needs to develop and maintain its mobile application, and preferably for both the IOS and Android platforms; </li><li>  the restaurant needs promotion of its mobile application, which is not a core business; </li><li>  the audience of users will be limited only to guests of this institution. </li></ul><br>  A single aggregator for institutions, as an effective tool for analyzing data and attracting an audience. <br><br>  To avoid the above problems, modern restaurants and cafes use the services of application aggregators, consider the main advantages of this approach: <br><br><ul><li>  cost savings on the development and promotion of the application; </li><li>  quick attraction of the right audience - potential guests; </li><li>  saving time and money on email-mailing. </li></ul><br>  Due to the fact that users download the aggregator application for different restaurants, the aggregator audience is always much larger than the audience of a single restaurant. <br><br>  Thus, having connected its establishment to any application aggregator, the restaurant has the ability to send PUSH notifications to users and forget about the ineffective e-mail distribution. <br><br>  Now let's figure out how to use the push notification tool in the restaurant business.  Conventional informational messages, of course, have the right to exist, but we believe that modern marketing should have a targeted approach and offer each user exactly what will be interesting and useful for him. <br><br>  Thanks to the application of the aggregator (through which the order is made), the restaurant knows that he has a guest who orders beef steak most often and never drinks cappuccino.  It is logical to assume that such a guest should be offered a share / discount on a steak and there is no point in sending PUSH notifications with information about cappuccino. <br><br>  The first step has been taken, we have interested the guest in the action on his favorite beef steaks.  What next?  Just informing a guest is a way from the last century, we need the guest to take an action - order and pay for their favorite steak. <br><br>  Upon receiving a push notification, the user not only receives information about the dish, but in one click can order it through the aggregator application.  And the ordering process is certainly not complete without paying for a bank card attached to the application. <br><br>  Summarizing the concept of PUSH notifications through the aggregator, the institution can: <br><br><ul><li>  get access to a large user base of the aggregator; </li><li>  carry out targeted marketing taking into account the real orders of users in restaurants; </li><li>  provide users with the opportunity of one-click after receiving PUSH notification to place an order in a restaurant or book a table there. </li></ul><br>  As you can see, using the capabilities of the aggregator application to attract new customers and increase the loyalty of regular customers, there is no longer a need to collect e-mail addresses and conduct mass mailings. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/353998/">https://habr.com/ru/post/353998/</a></p>
