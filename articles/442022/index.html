      The fact is that we have long ceased to perceive the design as something about pictures.  Design is about solving problems and specific tasks, about how to help the user. <br><br>  Designers have long ceased to argue that cooler: Illustrator or Corel, Figma or Sketch.  (It is clear that IllustratorÔ£øSketch.) Today, the designer needs to understand the technologies and methodologies in order to find a worthy solution to the problem, meet the budget, find a common language with the customer, make the user happy. <br><br>  In <a href="https://2019.codefest.ru/program/design">the design section,</a> we have collected useful life cases that will be shared by the best speakers of our time.
