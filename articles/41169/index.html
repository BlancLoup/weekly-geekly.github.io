    <h6>  How to describe your idea in one sentence? </h6><br>  To select content that is useful for a specific user based on his interests, obtained by analogue of fm'ovskogo scrobbling. <br><br><h6>  Describe your idea in more detail. </h6><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  At the moment, most consumers of content digest too much of it, of which only a small fraction is needed. <br>  Let some service collect and remember what information the user consumes, and which of it he really needs. <br>  After a period of training, the service will recommend content. <br>  For this, he will build a graph containing information about what content was useful to which user and how much. <br>  For each user, in response to a request for a portion of content, the service will find people who are most similar in their assessments of the content that our user has consumed (let's call them ‚Äúneighbors‚Äù).  And it will give out the content that our user has not read yet, but was highly appreciated by his neighbors. <br>  The selection mechanism can be improved to more complex and effective.  High technology will help us in this +) <br><br><h6>  What problem is your idea? </h6><br>  The average user has to digest too much information (news feeds, UGC in communities, entertainment content, ..).  Only a small part of the consumed information "pays off" the time and effort spent in order to "digest" this content. <br><br>  For example: I read several communities, which takes about an hour a day.  I also began to notice that I was less tired and I worked better when the amount of information I consumed was not very large.  This is also noted by my colleagues.  From this I conclude that people just need a service that will give me a small amount (namely, as much as I want) the most necessary information from all of me that he ‚Äúknows‚Äù. <br><br>  And as long as it is not there, I have to digest tons of informational garbage (even if this garbage is just for me, for someone else garbage is different content, it is important that this garbage exists, and it interferes).  Both in thematic communities and in entertainment resources. <br><br><h6>  If your idea is implemented, how and to whom will it bring the greatest benefit? </h6><br>  The effectiveness of search and content consumption will increase significantly.  As a result, the overall efficiency of people‚Äôs activities will also increase, because they will not tire of information noise, and will act on the basis of better information. <br><br>  The idea will bring the greatest benefit to all consumers of information on the Internet =) <br><br><h6>  What are the initial steps needed to bring your idea to life? </h6><br>  Embed technology into a large information consumption service (RSS aggregator is the most optimal place).  To convey to users the main idea and "force" them to try it on themselves. <br><br><h6>  If your idea is chosen and successfully implemented, what results will be achieved?  How do you rate them? </h6><br>  For the service, which introduced the technology, "weighty highlight" and an excellent competitive advantage. <br>  For users of the service, improving their own efficiency, getting rid of informational garbage, fatigue, and everything connected with it. <br><br>  PS: PPNH. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/41169/">https://habr.com/ru/post/41169/</a></p>
