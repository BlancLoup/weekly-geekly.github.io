  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Why do people lose interest in elections?</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  We have a breed of people in our country whom we don‚Äôt feed with bread - let me just ponder just how much better it was to live in Russia under King Pu.  Of course, they do it from the pure soul and at the behest of the conscience.  One snag: the more they say that we have democracy, civil society and honest government, the further we get away from all this.  Because why fix something that's okay?  But nothing is in order - neither with democracy, nor with civil society, nor with, forgive me, the Criminal Code, the authorities. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a>  A simple example: Medvedev elections were held, the most boring elections in recent and not very dynamic years.  No competition, no pluralism - of course, people are bored.  And on the Vedmedev people, in general, poklast - well, they appointed a flea with him.  However, there are people who have begun to argue that this is supposedly good, a sign of a mature society.  After all, in the West, in Switzerland, everyones do not attach much importance to elections either - whoever is their president / chancellor / prime minister - life goes on.  Here we are, we are told, have survived to this.  Here it is happiness, stability. <br><br>  I do not know how anyone, but I see in this one big lie.  Most recently I had to argue with one guardian on this topic.  And, in order not to repeat any more, he <a href="http://free-sight.ru/go-to-article/9/">wrote a short article-answer</a> in his journal.

      Summary I brought the following: <br><br><blockquote>  The prohibitively low level of public interest in politics, which the government issues as a sign of the development of our society, means only the success of a strategy of disgusting a citizen from political processes.  The state media‚Äôs crumbling media repression, the ousting of opposition‚Äôs real politics, the abolition of governors ‚Äôelections and many other measures have done their job: citizens have to put up with the fact that all the most important issues of the current historical moment will be decided for us without us. <br><br>  This political nihilism has absolutely nothing to do with the confidence of the citizens of the old democracies that, whatever their authority, it will firmly stand on the principles of humanism, respect for human rights and respect for the constitutions of their countries. <br><br>  Of course, outwardly apathy and confidence are characterized by the same absence of unnecessary gestures, but it is still rather difficult to confuse them - if you do not limit yourself to a superficial look at the problem, of course. <br><br>  This state of affairs is a potential danger.  The sleep of the mind gives rise to monsters - and they all lie for the time being for the people's silence.  The mentality of the Russian person is such that it is in an apathetic state that an explosion is ripening in him.  This feature, which Gumilev noticed, should not be shut down - no matter how quickly we would like to believe that all the worst things in our history are over and we are almost in Europe.  Democracy requires vigilance. </blockquote><br><br>  Question: what do you think about this? </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/25230/">https://habr.com/ru/post/25230/</a></p>
