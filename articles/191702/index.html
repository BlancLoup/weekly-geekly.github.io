As a rule, users try to choose a laptop in accordance with their needs: one needs portable ultrabooks for frequent trips, someone with a head grabs budget models, and for someone they need powerful and productive models.  It is to the latter applies the novelty from the company HP - laptop EliteBook 8770w.  According to the manufacturers, this model is intended primarily for designers, architects and people of other creative professions - those users who have to work with large volumes of graphics, 3D-models and animation.  Under Habrokat - a review of the new model. <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  <b>By clothes we meet</b> <br>  Model EliteBook 8770w really can not be called portable because of the 17-inch display.  However, the reason is not only in the display diagonals.  The case of the laptop is made of aluminum and magnesium alloy, which makes it quite massive - the weight of the laptop is 3.8 kg with a thickness of 3.7 cm.

The model will look great as an elegant, albeit rather big, accessory on trips, and will successfully fit into your home interior.  Circular grinding of the cover, as well as the matte finish of the working panel, protects the device from greasy marks and fingerprints left. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage3/517/653/f62/517653f62ee855646a87889eefde3919.jpg"><br><br>  It is also worth noting the presence of a special cover in the lower part of the case, which is easy to open thanks to a special latch.  When you open this cover, the user gets access to the internal elements of the device ‚Äî the hard disk, RAM modules, etc. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage3/9db/180/b21/9db180b2112bd7addae40e773c749bdf.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage3/4e6/b01/be7/4e6b01be762ba368093a52561ee7754f.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage3/398/d2a/ca4/398d2aca4b6cc5d4c64183f298236c9c.jpg"><br><br>  <b>Display - all head!</b> <br><br>  The EliteBook 8770w laptop screen has a 17.3-inch diagonal with a resolution of 1920x1080 pixels.  The device is equipped with an HP DreamColor Display IPS-matrix.  It allows you to provide a fairly high level of color rendering, as well as a good indicator of average brightness and its distribution, which is very important for working with applications for graphics processing.  In addition, the display also has a fairly wide viewing level. <br><br>  The screen has a special matte coating that prevents stains on its surface. <br><br>  It is worth noting that various configurations of the model 8770w can also be equipped with displays with matte WVA-matrices with a resolution of 1600x900 and 1920x1080 pixels. <br><br>  <b>Look inside</b> <br>  Now let's dwell on the stuffing of the laptop.  Immediately it is worth making a reservation that the model has a large number of configurations that differ in the amount of RAM and hard disk, as well as the model of the video card.  This allows the user to select a device with the required level of performance. <br><br>  The HP EliteBook 8770w runs on quad-core Intel Core i5 and i7 processors on the Ivy Bridge architecture with a maximum clock speed of up to 3.7 GHz.  The possible amount of RAM model is from 8 to 32 GB DDR3.  As a video card for this laptop, 4 professional-grade models can be used - NVIDIA Quadro K3000M, K4000M and K5000M, as well as the AMD FirePro M4000 with AMD Eyefinity technology, which allows you to connect up to five monitors.  The device is equipped with hard drives in the form factor of 2.5 inches in volume from 750 GB to 1.5 TB with a spindle speed of 7200 rev / min.  In addition, the model can also be additionally equipped with 24, 128 GB or 256 GB SSDs designed for OS installation. <br><br>  The laptop, which fell under the microscope in this review, is based on the Intel Core i7-3610QM processor with a clock frequency of 2.3 GHz.  The laptop has onboard 8 GB of RAM and is equipped with a NVIDIA Quatro K4000M graphics card, the amount of video memory is 4 GB.  Hard disk capacity is 750 GB.  Such characteristics provide the device with good performance in programs for creating three-dimensional models and allow processing large arrays of graphic data.  In addition, 8770w is also good for modern "heavy" computer games. <br><br>  <b>Remote control: input devices</b> <br>  Model HP EliteBook 8770w is equipped with a full-size keyboard with a separate dedicated digital unit.  The keyboard, as well as the entire case of the laptop, is protected from moisture and dust, and also has an adjustable backlight keys.  The keys have a good return and average speed, so the keyboard is quite comfortable to use.  No less convenient and matte touchpad model, consisting of a touch field and three control buttons.  The touchpad supports multi-touch gestures, while the touch screen has good sensitivity and accuracy, timely responding to touch.  In addition, the laptop is equipped with a trackpoint located in the middle of the keyboard.  Below, below the keys, there are three buttons to control it.  In fact, the trackpoint duplicates the functions of the touchpad, and the user has the choice of which control to use. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage3/7a6/ea1/e1c/7a6ea1e1c678d34dc3d135879c8eead0.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage3/8c6/6bc/319/8c66bc31930ec14fdc1b45be194bd56b.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage3/fe2/f48/c7c/fe2f48c7c5e3157232af82d13ec80741.jpg"><br><br>  <b>Communication Wizard: a set of interfaces</b> <br>  The developers have provided the HP EliteBook 8770w with a very wide range of communication capabilities.  The set of interfaces of the model makes it a full-fledged mobile workstation, which can be successfully used both as a separate terminal and in an office network, connecting to network resources via both wired and wireless communication channels. <br>  A variety of ports and connectors spaced at all ends of the laptop.  Most of them are located on the left side of the device - there are two USB 3.0 ports, FireWire, a combined eSATA + USB 2.0 connector, an ExpressCard / 54 expansion slot, a Display Port, a LAN connector and a Kensington lock. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage3/a79/983/f15/a79983f15a60f75fa489a5fe9f2dad8e.jpeg"><br><br>  On the right side you can find another pair of USB 2.0 ports, a VGA video output, a smart card slot, two standard 3.5 mm audio outputs, and an optical drive with support for Blu-Ray discs. <br><br>  On the rear edge are the power connector and a jack for the RJ-11 modem, and the front is an SD / MMC card reader. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage3/ae3/677/e5f/ae3677e5ffe5aef1e483040da91a7604.jpg"><br><br>  In addition, in the lower part of the case there is also a special proprietary connector for installing a laptop on the docking station (the latter is not included in the delivery package). <br><br>  <b>As an afterword</b> <br>  As you can see, the model HP EliteBook 8770w is primarily intended for professionals working with demanding applications, and for use for work purposes.  It is not entirely advisable to acquire such a ‚Äútoy‚Äù for recreation and entertainment - the laptop costs a lot, the prices for the device start from about 12,000 and up to 32,000 UAH, and not everyone can afford this pleasure.  But users who need a powerful mobile workstation will appreciate the performance and speed of this model. <br><br><hr><br>  <a href="http://www.service.muk.ua/">MUK-Service - all types of IT repair: warranty, non-warranty repair, sale of spare parts, contract service</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/191702/">https://habr.com/ru/post/191702/</a></p>
