    <a name="habracut"></a><br>  <b>Introduction</b> <br><blockquote>  The supramental race of beings created the computer "Deep Thought" - the second in performance over the whole existence of time and the Universe - to find the Final Answer to the greatest question of Life, the Universe and All That.  After seven and a half million years of computation, Deep Thought gave the answer: ‚ÄúForty-two.‚Äù  The reaction was: <br>  - Forty-two!  - screamed Lunkkuol.  ‚ÄúIs that all you can say after seven and a half million years of work?‚Äù <br>  ‚ÄúI checked everything very thoroughly,‚Äù said the computer, ‚Äúand with all certainty I declare that this is the Answer.‚Äù  It seems to me that if we are absolutely honest with you, the whole thing is that you yourself did not know what the Question is. <br>  - But this is the Great Question!  The Final Question of Life, the Universe and All That!  - almost howled Lunkkuol. <br>  ‚ÄúYes,‚Äù said the computer in the voice of a sufferer who enlightens the fool.  - And what is this question? </blockquote><br>  <i>Douglas Adams ‚ÄúThe Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy‚Äù</i> <br>  Following the basic postulate of management that we cannot control what we cannot measure, it is necessary to create conditions for managing the training of specialists in computer security.  The main question or goal that is posed in this work is to create the most adequate competence model of a specialist, which would take into account the needs of the market for such specialists, the requirements imposed by enterprises on such employees, as well as the capabilities of the higher education institution to train such specialists. <br>  In addition, it is necessary to take into account advanced domestic and foreign experience in the field of information technology, psychology and recruitment.  For the most part, a computer security specialist will be confronted with the work of modern information systems, as well as prevent unscrupulous people from taking over information of commercial value. <br>  This paper is divided into three chapters.  The first chapter gives an understanding of what to consider as a competency, what to consider as a competence model, what methods are used in practice to create a qualitative competence model of a specialist. <br>  The second chapter describes the competency model, which was compiled as a result of the analysis, classification and generalization of the material association of computer and information technology enterprises (APCIT) according to the third generation GOS VPO standard for specialties related to information technology, as well as the competencies indicated by JSC ‚Äú Svyazinvest "for specialists in information and economic security.  It is important to note that APKIT used the experience of such companies as ABBYY, Intel, Microsoft, Motorola, IBM, Oracle, 1C, EMC, Sun, Cisco, Luxoft, Kaspersky Lab, which are leaders in the information technology industry and their requirements for creating competency models. training specialists are based on the real needs of this market. <br>  The third chapter provides a generalization of the resulting model of a specialist and an assessment of the existing level of training of specialists in computer security for the developed model.  In addition, further paths are indicated to improve the competency model itself and to improve the educational process. <br><br>  <b>Chapter 1. Basic concepts, types and structure of competencies</b> <br><blockquote>  Wireless telegraph is easy to understand.  An ordinary telegraph looks like a very long cat: you pull on the tail in New York, and it meows in Los Angeles.  Wireless is the same, but without a cat. </blockquote><br>  <i>Albert Einstein</i> <br>  <b>Core Competence Concepts</b> <br>  To begin with, we will designate the basic concepts with which we will operate, considering competencies.  This is necessary for a uniform and clear understanding of the material presented.  Given the variety of different definitions and interpretations used in theory and practice, it should be remembered that the definitions given are not true in the last resort, but only the options that are used in the stated material.  The proposed definitions are not standardized, but they make it possible to correctly designate the basic terms used in this work. <br>  Unfortunately, in the Russian language, several popular and frequently used expressions have historically taken root, including single-root words with the word ‚Äúcompetence‚Äù.  This is significantly confusing when trying to comprehend the essence of the concept of "competence" in relation to the training of specialists in the university and to the business in the field of personnel management.  For example, we like to say: ‚ÄúHe is incompetent,‚Äù ‚ÄúIt is not within my area of ‚Äã‚Äãexpertise.‚Äù  ‚ÄúHe is incompetent‚Äù does not mean at all that a person does not possess any competencies.  As a rule, behind these expressions lies an assessment of the level of authority of the subject.  And absolutely nothing to do with the terminology used in the system of competencies. <br>  First of all, let us denote the difference between the concepts of ‚Äúcompetence‚Äù and ‚Äúcompetence‚Äù [].  They are based on the Latin root compete - I seek, I correspond, I come up. <br>  Competence is a certain characteristic of a person, necessary for the performance of certain works and allowing its owner to obtain the necessary results of work. <br>  Competence is the ability of an individual with a personal characteristic to solve work tasks to obtain the necessary work results. <br>  In other words, competence is the standard of behavior required for a certain activity, and competence is the level of knowledge of this standard of behavior, that is, the final result of its application. <br>  Key competencies - a set of competencies that allows an employee to perform their professional duties as effectively as possible. <br>  ZUN - knowledge, skills, abilities. <br>  PVK - professionally important qualities: individual qualities of the subject of activity, influencing the efficiency of the activity and the success of its development.  ‚ÄúProfessionally important qualities are qualities that are important for the profession, regardless of the particular company.‚Äù <br>  A competency model is a structured set of necessary, identifiable, and measurable competencies with behavioral indicators. <br>  Behavior indicators are standards of behavior that correspond to the effective actions of a person with a specific competence.  At the same time, as a rule, the object is manifestations of a high level of competence. <br>  Competence clusters are a set of competencies (usually from two to five) connected in a single semantic block.  Most often, models distinguish such clusters as: intellectual (mental) activity, achievement of results, work with people, work with information. <br>  <b>Types of competencies</b> <br>  Speaking about the types of competencies, two significant points should be noted: <br>  - species diversity of competences in the absence of standards; <br>  - the existence of several classifications, that is, species diversity (there is not a single classification of types of competencies, there are many different classifications for various reasons. It is very problematic to orient in this variety of species. Many classifications are extremely inconvenient and obscure, which makes their use in practice extremely difficult. But One way or another, the current situation affects the practice of building a competency model). <br>  In a variety of theoretical and practical materials on the topic of competence, you can find a variety of typologies.  In world practice, there are examples of attempts to develop universal typologies and competency models that claim to be the world standard.  For example, SHL - the world leader in the field of psychometric assessment and solution development - back in 2004 declared the creation of a universal basic competence structure by a group of consultants under the leadership of Professor Dave Bartram.  The basic structure created by the Bartram group included 112 components headed by the so-called ‚ÄúBig Eight Competencies‚Äù.  It is possible that global unification trends will soon lead to the emergence of a single standard generally accepted by all.  Competences are a rather peculiar tool, so it is practically very difficult to create a single set of competencies that any university and any company can use. <br>  In addition, one should not forget that competence must be measurable.  That is, introducing competence, it is necessary to check it for the possibility of assessment.  It is important to remember precisely when developing a competency model, since  it is often tempting to include personal qualities of a social nature.  For example, "justice."  To measure the presence of this competence in a person is very problematic, since  the concept of "fair" is largely relatively and difficult to identify. <br>  Professional competencies are localized in scale.  But a certain set of professional competencies is inherent in any position and / or specialty.  This type of competence is a set of personal characteristics, as well as the knowledge and skills necessary to work effectively in a particular position.  Considering that our classification of competencies is limited to university frameworks, professional competencies of positions and professional competencies of activities or professional areas should not be confused. <br>  The professional competencies of the activities and areas are more generalized.  And the professional competence of the position is limited to the specific company.  For example, there may be competences of an employee of the pedagogical sphere - they are typical for all specialists engaged in pedagogical activities, regardless of the organization in which they work, or they may be the professional competencies of a teacher of a specific educational organization.  Speaking of professional competencies as a kind of competencies, we are talking about them. <br>  Table 1 <br><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-JFmJTk_4_YY/T8hazDcEu7I/AAAAAAAADt4/jUQO3avGYK4/s902/komp.png" width="900">  Management competencies are the most localized and complex type of competencies.  These are the competencies necessary for the fulfillment of managerial duties to those who will occupy managerial positions, whether it be personnel management or system administration.  Strangely enough, the development of managerial competencies is the most difficult - the temptation to create a model of an ideal supermanager is too great, which is unlikely to be implemented in practice.  Therefore, when developing, it is recommended to include in the list of managerial competencies an optimal set based on the principle of necessary and sufficient competences. <br>  Competency structure <br>  The competency framework serves as the basis for developing a competency model.  We will discuss further what constitutes a competency model. <br>  And now about our own competence structure - about what elements competencies consist of and what these elements represent, see table.  one. <br>  From the table we see that the structure of competence is quite complex, including a set of elements, the combination of which makes, in fact, competence the universal tool we are talking about.  From the presented structure, it becomes clear why the competence cannot be considered only the ZUN or the PWC, which are only an element of the competence. <br><img alt="fig.1" height="322" src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/60c/8dd/1b5/60c8dd1b54d74446175cfc750b05b9e1.png" title="fig.1" width="625"><br>  <i>Figure 1. The full universal competence structure (START).</i> <br>  It should be noted that in the theory and practice of building a competence model there are different types of competency structures.  For example, the so-called START is actively used - a full universal competence structure (see Fig. 1). <br>  In addition, many do not use off-the-shelf developments, fundamentally go their own way and develop their own competency structures.  This is justified and effective only if experienced specialists are involved in the development of the model, since for novice developers this task is either not within the strength or threatens to create an incorrect and inefficiently working competence structure. <br>  <b>Competency model</b> <br>  A model is a logical description of components and functions that reflect the essential properties of the object being modeled. <br>  A competency model is a logical description of the elements and functions of competencies.  The competence model contains a detailed description of the standards of human behavior in a particular position leading to the achievement of official goals. <br>  The degree of detail in the competency model depends on the goals for which the model is applied.  Some seek to cover the whole range of information and develop a model for all occasions.  Such a model, as a rule, is very difficult to use and ineffective.  In addition, it is very difficult to develop, since, according to experts, the difference between many competences is extremely small and hardly distinguishable.  The experience of recent years of applying the competency model shows that the set of competencies should be optimal and include only key standards of behavior. <br>  Our task is to show the logic and technology of development and application of the competency model in a simple version. <br>  <b>The role of the competency model in the management system.</b>  <b>Areas of use</b> <br>  Competences are closely connected with the strategy of the educational process, respectively, their purpose is to contribute to the realization of strategic goals.  The competence model solves this problem through certain functions and areas of application of these functions.  Applications are shown below.  Functions are a type of specific activity through which the competence model works in a particular area.  For example, in the field of personnel training and development, the competence model works through assessments of the zone of missing competencies for an employee.  Consider them in more detail. <br>  As mentioned at the outset, the competency model is a multifunctional and almost universal tool, so it works in various areas of management.  In the first place - in the management of human resources. <br>  Content of competency model <br>  As it has already become clear from the above, the content of the competency model includes: <br>  - a complete set of competencies and behavioral indicators; <br>  -description of standards of conduct or standards of action leading to the implementation of the tasks and goals; <br>  - levels of competence (if they are provided and applied). <br>  In itself, the content of the model is not a guarantee for creating a tool to improve the efficiency of the educational and working process.  The effectiveness of the model depends on the quality of the content.  And the result of using the model is directly related to the quality of organizational activity and the harmony of the entire management system.  Unfortunately, very often the competence models, which include all the necessary elements, nevertheless, do not give the expected effect, but only spend resources on their maintenance.  Often the reason for this situation is the poor quality of the model. <br>  The qualitative content of the model must meet the following criteria: <br>  1. Compliance with the strategic goals of the industry.  This means that the developed competences should contribute to the further activities of graduates in various companies in the core industry, aimed at achieving these goals, and not include the entire conceivable and inconceivable set of possible competencies. <br>  2. Usefulness for all who participate in its operation (specialists of various companies using the model as a tool, teachers).  It should be remembered that the subject of the model are students who also have their goals, their motives for work and their needs.  This means that the model should also be of interest to students and be useful to them. <br>  3. The optimal set of model elements, the absence of repetitions and intersections. <br>  4. Competence measurability and availability of accounting for expected changes.  The optimal set of competencies and their measurability are aimed at the comfort of operating the model, the objectivity of measurements and the possibility of effective use of the results obtained.  The presence of the accounting system of expected changes allows you to get the desired range of application of the system and makes the system useful to all participants.  For example, assessment of students and teachers on the basis of the competency model, which successfully replaces attestation, with a change accounting system, makes it possible to competently plan career development, trace the dynamics of changes, and tie the results to wages.  It also establishes the relationship between the development of a student and the growth of his future salary, making his expectations realistic. <br>  5. Simplicity and transparency of the competency model.  A very important aspect of the content of the competency model is its volume.  Some manage to develop such a voluminous model that its description is a weighty volume with a multi-page extensive description of hundreds of competencies and multiple examples.  Everyone knows perfectly well that the more extensive any instruction is, the less chance it has of being at least fully read, and not something studied.  This rule also applies to the description of the competency model, although it does not mean that the documentation describing the system should be stingy and extremely short, but when creating it, the optimality rule should be observed. <br>  Competences should be not only accurate, but also politically correct, not affecting self-esteem.  For example, is it correct to measure a person‚Äôs honesty and what to do if its level is insufficient? <br>  The competency model can be simplified (without competency levels) and more complex (with levels).  The simple model ‚ÄúCompetences without level‚Äù contains only the basic standards of behavior and, as a rule, the same set of behavioral indicators for all.  It does not take into account the levels of training.  The competence model may contain so-called levels of competence and allows you to cover a wider range of students' training levels and take into account various nuances.  And such a model is called ‚ÄúCompetence by level‚Äù.  In this case, the behavior indicators for the same specialties belonging to different levels will be different.  For example, for the administrator and the manager, some competences may well coincide, but the level of their manifestation is different, depending on the level of authority and responsibility. <br>  The structure of the competency model is clearly demonstrated by a schematic image.  As an example, below is a diagram of the so-called format-cluster competence model (see Fig. 2). <br><img alt="fig.2" height="322" src="http://ic.pics.livejournal.com/w7062c/15836301/493588/493588_original.png" title="fig.2" width="625"><br>  <i>Figure 2. Format-cluster model of competencies.</i> <br>  <b>Competency profile</b> <br>  The profile of competences, in essence, is a set of competencies that an employee must have who meets the position held, or a graduate of a specialty who meets the requirements for university graduates.  But this is not just a set, but a list, including the necessary level of development of each competence for a particular specialty / position.  The profile of competencies is most often made up in the form of a diagram that allows you to visually illustrate the required level.  After assessing the employee‚Äôs competency level, the charts are compared.  The discrepancies between the required level and the actual one become obvious.  The difference between them - this is the area of ‚Äã‚Äãtraining and development of the employee. <br>  Thus, the competency profile is a very simple and convenient ‚Äúvisual aid‚Äù when using the competency model.  An example of such a profile is shown in Fig.  3 <br><img alt="fig3" height="390" src="http://ic.pics.livejournal.com/w7062c/15836301/493951/493951_original.png" title="fig3" width="603"><br>  It is important to note that the competency profile is not static, it has the property of changing.  Moreover, it is the required levels of competencies that change.  This is due to human development over time, as well as changes in qualification requirements.  With the development of a competency model, the set of competencies can also change.  Therefore, the developed competency profiles cannot be used for a long time, they have a certain ‚Äúshelf life‚Äù.  But this does not mean that they need to be developed every time.  They require checking for relevance before use and, if necessary, updating. <br>  <b>Chapter 2. Versatile competence model of a computer security specialist</b> <br><blockquote>  <i>Opening an order is not an easy task, but if it is found, it is not at all difficult to understand.</i> </blockquote><br>  <i>Rene Descartes</i> <br>  Sources [2] close to the Ministry of Education and Science of the Russian Federation suggest initially classifying the competencies of graduates into two large groups: <br><ul><li>  General competences (universal, key, superprofessional); </li><li>  Subject-specialized competencies (professional). </li></ul>  But such an approach is absolutely no different from the one that is present in GOS VPO 2 generations.<font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Behind the only difference is that the terms (namely, the terms, not the essence) of the subject-oriented approach have been transferred to the terms of competence. In GOS VPO second generation disciplines studied at the university are divided into 2 large classes: general education and special. Apparently, in this case, the role was played by the fact that people tend to rely on familiar entities, rather than turn to another area of ‚Äã‚Äãhuman knowledge. In addition, a return to, in essence, a subject-oriented approach contradicts the original goal, which was laid down in the concept of competence and which is mentioned in this manual in the introduction, where the author of the manual quotes himself [3], namely: ‚ÄúIn the framework of the Bologna process, European universities in varying degrees and with varying degrees of enthusiasm master (adopt) the competence approach,which is seen as a kind of tool for strengthening the social dialogue of higher education with the world of work, a means of deepening their hundreds of activities and restoring them in the new conditions of mutual trust.</font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> So, summing up the previous paragraph, we say that the main task of the competence-based approach in education is to establish the correspondence between the capabilities of an educational institution, the requirements of the real economy and the abilities of the student. </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Since higher educational institutions are at the stage of waiting for the standards of the third generation, or are trying to somehow prove on their own that the standard of the third generation differs from the standard of the second generation only by renaming the subject for competence; </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Students and applicants are in a state of happy ignorance, what awaits them after graduation, and the real sector of the economy is struggling with the consequences of the financial and economic crises, it is proposed to consider the requirements of enterprises for computer security specialists.</font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The search for information on open sources (in fact, and on closed sources too) did not yield results precisely on the competence model of a computer security specialist in the state educational system of the higher professional education of a new generation. However, an interesting article was found by S. M. Avdoshin [4]. In the article, the author summarizes the experience gained when working in a project to develop information standards for the information technology industry [5]. So, this project was carried out under the auspices of the Association of Computer and Information Technology Enterprises (APCIT) and on the website [6] of this association, the following competence models of specialists are freely available: </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">1. Programmer; </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">2. System architect; </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">3. Information Systems Specialist; </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">4. System analyst; </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">5. Specialist in system administration;</font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">6. Information Technology Manager; </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">7. Database Administrator. </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Why do we need all these seemingly irrelevant competencies? The fact is that the basis of computer and information security is the postulate that only an integrated approach can bring success in the field of security. Information security is a relatively young, rapidly developing field of information technology, for the successful assimilation of which it is important to learn from the very beginning a modern basis coordinated with other branches of information technology [7].</font></font> Those.<font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">All of the above competences in the field of information technology are necessary as a basis for building a high-quality, versatile competence model of a computer security specialist. </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Competency models created by APKIT are divided into qualification levels from the lowest level 1 (assistant system administrator, personal computer operator) to the highest level 8 (information technology manager with a degree and experience in a management position for at least 5 years). In addition, according to these qualification levels, the competency models proposed by APCIT subdivide the training of bachelors, specialists and masters.</font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">According to the current standard of higher education for the specialty "Computer Security" [8]: "The standard time for mastering the basic educational program for training an information security specialist in the specialty 075200 - computer security for full-time education is 5 years 6 months."</font></font> Those.<font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Students take 6 courses of study, therefore, according to some competency-based models developed at APCIT, it is possible to use the qualification levels of masters as a basis. </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Based on the above, we select the following qualification levels: </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">1. Programmer - 3 qualification level; </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">2. System architect - 4 qualification level; </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">3. Information systems specialist - 3 qualification level; </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">4. System analyst - 3 qualification level; </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">5. System administration specialist - 5th qualification level; </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">6. Information Technology Manager - 4 qualification level; </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">7. Database Administrator - 4 qualification level.</font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">So, if you simply combine by the addition method those skills and abilities that correspond to the above list, you will get more than 2000 positions containing skills and abilities, and they will be repeated, because we are talking about one industry. If you select only unique skills and abilities peculiar to all the above basic competence models in the field of information technologies, you will get 673 unique skills and skills that experts from APCIT considered necessary to be included in the standard of training of relevant profiles.</font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">But with a list of more than six hundred skills and abilities (not counting knowledge), it‚Äôs quite difficult to work due to the specific perception of information by the human brain [9], it is necessary to somehow classify these skills and abilities to reduce the complexity and complexity of creating competence models. </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Following the methodology of object-oriented analysis and design [10], so that the model of a specialist looks like a model, and not as a pile of hard-to-read and difficult-to-distinguish competencies based on skills. It is necessary to make a classification of competencies. Since there are no methods for creating an ideal classification, you will have to rely on your own intuition and experience. </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The first thing that comes to mind is the following classification: </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">subdivision first (subject)</font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">1. Mathematics; </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">2. Physics; </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">3. Information technology; </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">4. Economics and governing documents; </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">5. Security in a broad sense. </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">But how does this differ from the GOSE VPO 2 generations, in which exactly the knowledge model goes. Perhaps nothing. Therefore, it is better to propose a classification based on skills, but not knowledge. Knowledge in the model should be in symbiosis with skills. </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The following initial classification of competencies is proposed: </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">1. Documents and standards (global and domestic standards for information technology, information protection, health and fire safety, civil defense, quality standards, federal laws, the Labor Code, FSTEC guidelines, other regulatory and legal acts, internal and project documentation)</font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">2. Personal business qualities and motivation (abilities, self-development, resistance to stress, the ability to mobilize their forces in a short period of time, the ability to persuade, the ability to listen, the ability to subjugate the crowd, focus on results, a high level of self-motivation) </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">3. Programming (languages programming, the process of software development, quality assurance methods of software products, inspections, etc., etc.) </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">4. Operating systems, computers and networks (ideology, architecture, design, implementation and support) </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">5. basics of data (creation, administration, protection) </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">6. System analysis and management (analysis of all information systems, business processes, infrastructure management)</font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">7. Work with people (interaction with customers, personnel management, interaction with users, work with permitting and authorized bodies, work with government officials) </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">8. Economic security (economics, accounting and audit basics, forms of ownership, interests of criminals, physical security of objects organization of the security regime in the enterprise, understanding the interaction of all company structures, the ability to conduct internal investigations, interaction with the Ministry of Internal Affairs, the Federal Security Service and other security agencies, understanding of new business intelligence, psychology foundations) </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">9. Tool control (to prevent leakage of information on the physical fields, detection of bookmarks and bugs, check the equipment for the presence in it of extraneous embedded devices)</font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">10. Information security (encryption, VPN, FireWall, Antivirus, IDS, access control, passwords, data recovery, security policies). </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">In the course of further work on classifications, skills and abilities were divided into subclasses, which are given in subsequent sections of this chapter.

For now in educational institutions the main emphasis is on the transfer of knowledge, and, knowledge, as a rule, obsolete 5 years, or even 10 years in relation to technology and the requirements of today. </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The evolution of the specialist model from course to course.</font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">All of the above referred to the assessment of an already prepared specialist, i.e. University graduate. But a good model must imply the development of itself, and therefore include sub-models. Since the specialist is trained for 6 courses, it is advisable to point out that the model must evolve with the student. Figure 7 shows roughly how this model should evolve. The dependence is not the number of competencies, but the power of competences because competencies must develop as knowledge and skills are accumulated in the learning process and from one basic competence that was given to a student in the first year there will be ten total competencies to graduate, some basic competences may unite.But all this must be taken into account in the framework of individual subjects throughout the whole process of learning. But such research goes beyond the scope of this paper.</font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">In addition, this work does not take into account the knowledge component, because </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">in order to build a complete model taking into account knowledge, it is necessary to review the curriculum for each discipline taught in this specialty, which will take more than the time allotted to perform this work. </font></font><br><br><br><br><img alt="fig.8" height="413" src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/768/687/2c6/7686872c61f1fe5f049c0e7919002e46.png" title="fig.8" width="644"><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Figure 7 Evolution of the competency model along with the learning process</font></font><br>  <b>Conclusion</b> <br><blockquote> <i><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The goal of the school should always be to cultivate a harmonious personality, not a specialist.</font></font></i> </blockquote><br> <i><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Albert Einstein</font></font></i> <br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">If we sum up the present work, we can see that competencies are the link between the university and the enterprise, which the specialist will work after graduation. However, the training of specialists in the university at present does not take into account the real needs of enterprises in the knowledge and skills that are really necessary for work. Training of specialists in the framework of academic disciplines is shifted mainly towards fundamental scientific subjects, losing real needs in interaction with people, teamwork, the ability to competently work with documents. Undoubtedly, fundamental training is very important as a base, but it is impossible to dwell only on fundamental natural sciences. Need to move on.Now within the framework of the project of the Ministry of Education and Science of the Russian Federation, there is a unique chance to develop and use in the training of specialists a comprehensive standard based on the competency model. Universities in the third generation State Educational Institution of Higher Professional Education are given a great deal of freedom to create such standards for a number of specialties, and these opportunities must be used to ensure that a specialist graduating from an institution of higher education is closer to the ideal, and not to that dreadful sea urchin, which now turns out if you look at knowledge , skills and graduate skills. The higher school should first of all take care of the upbringing of the person, and then from the person to make a specialist.Universities in the third generation State Educational Institution of Higher Professional Education are given a great deal of freedom to create such standards for a number of specialties, and these opportunities must be used to ensure that a specialist graduating from an institution of higher education is closer to the ideal, and not to that dreadful sea urchin, which now turns out if you look at knowledge , skills and graduate skills.
