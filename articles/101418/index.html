  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Nokia Vice President on the company's upcoming plans</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Engadget interviewed Nokia's executive vice president, Nicklas Sawander.  I translated the main issues related to Meego and Symbian.  The main topics of the interview: <br>  - About N8: the smartphone will occupy a niche between medium and high-budget models.  Will go on sale at the end of the 3 quarter. <br>  - about MeeGo: the first smartphone based on the new OS will be announced at the end of 2010. <br>  - about Android: no plans for using Android on your devices.  And the point. <br>  - about tablets / smartphones with huge displays: the company decided not to produce tablets.  Savander believes that smartphones with large displays will look awkward. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  <b>Engadget: The new N8 flagship is coming soon, how much do you trust him along with MeeGo?</b>  <b>Will Symbian and MeeGo get along in the market of high-budget models?</b> <b><br></b>  <b>Savander:</b> N8 - the first model with an updated system.  There is no doubt that this will be an attractive, high-class, successful product.  We are not positioning the N8 as a high-budget device, but an average, between the high and middle class.  This segment is huge and we plan to produce more than 50 million devices on this Symbian platform. <br>  In parallel, we are working on MeeGo.  This is our main priority development and we are preparing to meet the demand for MeeGo devices in the high-budget segment.  MeeGo is more product for our portfolio.  One team deals with Symbian, promotes Symbian smartphones to the masses.  And Meego is a new level, innovation. <br>  Do not forget the developers.  Qt will be the main development tool, it will be used both in Symbian and MeeGo.  This will help in application compatibility for the two platforms. <br><br>  <b>E: Choosing Qt means that cross-platform development has a priority for you.</b>  <b>Do you hope that the average developer will pay attention to all platforms or specialize in only one?</b> <b><br></b>  <b>S:</b> We thought about it for a long time, we wanted to please everyone.  Using Qt on Symbian and MeeGo, we can reduce the differences between the platforms.  We want to create a predictable tool that simplifies the interaction of the two platforms. <br>  We want to create a tool that allows you to add applications with your plug-ins, without changing the code of the main application. <br><br>  <b>E: Should I expect tablets, for example, on Nokia's MeeGo?</b> <b><br></b>  <b>S:</b> I think the smartphone market is becoming more popular, many companies will try to produce them.  Big phones are interesting, for example, to see how big your hand is.  And at some point the device will be too big to be comfortable to hold in your hand.  Our pockets will be no more!  With a large screen and battery consumption will be sensitive.  And buyers do not want thick phones.  Of course, a niche of such phones will exist, there will be a certain zone between smartphones and tablets. <br>  We will be in this niche, but we understand that we must take into account many aspects: the device must be comfortable, with a large screen, but fit in your pocket, otherwise you can forget about mobility.  But no tablets.  This market will be crowded.  Tablets on Android, MeeGo, Windows - all and sundry, will release them.

      <b>E: Let's go back to MeeGo, we saw some photos of the graphical interface for smartphones and various Intel implementations.</b>  <b>How important is it to preserve the similarity of the interface and the appearance of applications between MeeGo and Symbian?</b> <b><br></b>  <b>S:</b> Subsequent versions are always better than previous ones.  We will make sure that our products on Symbian and MeeGo look related.  Of course, MeeGo will be different.  If Symbian was originally menu-oriented, then on the touchscreens from such a concept you need to get rid of, multi-level menus will not be convenient. <br><br>  <b>E: We can not ask a question about Android.</b>  <b>What do you think about using this OS?</b> <b><br></b>  <b>S:</b> We are not going to use this platform.  Why?  We basically believe that we can be on top, just producing good iron.  This is just a technical question, compare Android and MeeGo on our hardware, see which one is better. <br>  Well, the second factor, Android - the development of Google.  We do not want to be dependent on them.  The company accounts for 40% of the share of the smartphone market, we believe we should use our best practices. <br><br>  As a separate point, we would like to note that the company does not intend to use Wimax in its devices and considers LTE a more promising technology for wireless data transfer. <br><br>  <b>upd</b> Full article on the original <a href="http://www.engadget.com/2010/08/06/nokias-vp-talks-n8-meego-milestone-product-tablets-android/">here</a> . </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/101418/">https://habr.com/ru/post/101418/</a></p>
