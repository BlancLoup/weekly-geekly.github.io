  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Online Dating in Web 2.0 Style</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  The online dating industry does not stand still, intensively reworking itself in the style of Web 2.0.  At the same time dozens of new generation sites appear. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Online dating is a pretty significant business.  For example, in the US, the daily audience of dating sites is estimated at 4 million people, and monthly at 25 million, that is, 15% of Internet users.  According to comScore statistics, these sites in total generate about 4.5 billion hits per month.  And that's not counting MySpace, which formally falls into another category. <br><br>  The market has its own leaders - Yahoo Personals and Match.com, whose total audience is 9.3 million people per month.  Both of these sites require payment to access someone else‚Äôs personal information ($ 30 and $ 25 per month, respectively). <br><br>  Recently, however, a number of Web 2.0 generation services have appeared on the Internet that are trying to compete with the leaders.  Among them even Google is represented with its universal system Google Base.  TechCrunch has recently published a <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2006/07/23/online-dating-20-thirteen-sites-to-find-love/">review of</a> new generation <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2006/07/23/online-dating-20-thirteen-sites-to-find-love/">dating sites</a> .  It is rather curious to see how these developments differ from their predecessors.  We have compiled a list of those sites that differ precisely from a technological point of view.

        <script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>
        <ins class="adsbygoogle"
          style="display:block; text-align:center;"
          data-ad-layout="in-article"
          data-ad-format="fluid"
          data-ad-client="ca-pub-6974184241884155"

          (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
        </script>
      <br>
      For example, the <a href="http://www.consumating.com/">Consumating</a> dating site is based on the ubiquitous use of <a href="http://www.consumating.com/tags/">tags</a> .  Another interesting thing is <a href="http://www.consumating.com/everywhere/">widgets</a> .  Through them organized export of information.  The RSS feeds automatically receive the latest information about new characters on the dating site, if they meet the criteria (by tags or by place of residence). <br><br>  <a href="http://www.engage.com/">Engage</a> service uses in its activities viral marketing, which is reflected in its name.  Some users (the so-called "pimps") register their acquaintances on the site, while other users view the information and may be asked to meet someone from the described comrades. <br><br>  Dating on Google is organized through the universal database Google Base, in which you can enter information about anything, including <a href="http://base.google.com/base/search%3Fa_n0%3Dpeople%2Bprofiles%26amp%3Ba_y0%3D9%26amp%3Bhl%3Den%26amp%3Bgl%3DUS">people</a> .  Here, too, tags are used, and an anonymous ‚Äúone-time‚Äù email address is created for each user.  Approximately the same ideology of the ‚Äúglobal database‚Äù will be in the new service of <a href="http://personals.wikia.com/">Wikia Personals</a> , which is now just beginning to be created. <br><br>  On the <a href="http://www.greatboyfriends.com/">GreatBoyFriends</a> website, each participant‚Äôs file is accompanied by recommendations from his former partners: from his ex-wife, girlfriends and friends. <br><br>  One of the newest dating services in the style of Web 2.0 is <a href="http://matchactivity.com/">MatchActivity</a> .  This site is completely different from all of the above, because it is not based on the search for dating, but on the search for "activity" about the given coordinates.  By ‚Äúactivity‚Äù is meant joint drinking, going to a movie, a romantic dinner, sex, the beach, etc.  Supported tags, user ratings and recommendations.  Approximately the same principle is based service <a href="http://matchtag.com/">MatchTag</a> . <br><br>  The main idea of <a href="http://www.poddater.com/">Poddater</a> is video <a href="http://www.poddater.com/">conferencing</a> .  Everyone shoots a commercial about themselves and uploads it to the page with their profile.  It is very pleasant to lie back in a chair and watch videos of hundreds or other girls, choosing one to your taste. <br><br>  Almost every new generation dating service has its own peculiarity.  For example, on the <a href="http://www.rateordate.com/">RateOrDate</a> website, <a href="http://www.rateordate.com/">you</a> can see who met with whom and evaluate how they fit together, and the Flickr photo sharing service interface is integrated into the VerbDate service.  In order to take the lead in tough competition, you must definitely come up with something original. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/4212/">https://habr.com/ru/post/4212/</a></p>
