  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Experts believe that in autonomous cars will have sex</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Canadian officials are concerned about the future behavior of autonomous car owners.  Experts believe that the drivers of such cars will be too distracted from driving - for example, having sex at the wheel.  And this is just one of several things that will interfere with the owner in time to react to the situation and take control. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/85f/8c3/5d9/85f8c35d928945b1e85f2baf1f957a98.jpg" width="600" alt="image"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  In Canada, federal officials were charged with creating a regulatory framework for the regulation of unmanned vehicles.  During work, experts have already <a href="http://www.cbc.ca/news/technology/sex-distracted-driving-1.3562029">encountered problems</a> , including the human factor.  Drivers tend to overestimate the effectiveness of automation, because they are strongly distracted from the road when they drive robo cars, reports Canadian Press, citing a document received from the authorities. <br><br>  The Tesla car operating system with the possibility of unmanned driving has already proved that it‚Äôs too early for drivers to trust such cars - despite the warning from the manufacturer, they <a href="https://geektimes.ru/post/264474/">didn‚Äôt keep their hands on the wheel</a> , which led to a number of traffic accidents and funny videos on YouTube.  Tesla company warns that the autopilot function makes the car partially autonomous, but does not provide complete safety on the road.  The driver must be ready to take control at any time.  Instead, video bloggers brush their teeth and read books about Jobs at the wheel, putting their lives and the lives of other drivers in danger.

Experts predict that they will become completely unmanned only after several years of development. <br><br>  While in some US states autonomous cars like <a href="https://geektimes.ru/post/270384/">Google Car are</a> already allowed, in Canada they are not allowed on public roads yet.  The Canadian Department of Transportation has received an additional budget to create a regulatory framework.  The rules will at least include a mandatory ‚Äúsecurity mechanism‚Äù for situations where the driver is unavailable.  And the presence of the driver behind the wheel. <br><br>  But the "semi-automatic" Tesla will not fall under these rules.  They are already regulated in Canada according to the rules developed for autonomous parallel parking technologies and emergency braking assistance.  Therefore, it can be difficult to force drivers who do not pay attention to the road to take control at the right time - people simply will not have time to react.  Especially if they are engaged in suicidal sex in the back seat. <br><br>  Another rule that may become mandatory for robotic cars in Canada is the presence of a ‚Äúblack box‚Äù, which will register all data, as is the case with aircraft. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/393837/">https://habr.com/ru/post/393837/</a></p>
