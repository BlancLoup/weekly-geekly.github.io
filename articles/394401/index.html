  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Religion in gadgets</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Knowing my attitude to religious issues on Hiktaims, I risk opening a Pandora‚Äôs box, but religion does affect people.  In some places, in order to enter the market, certain conditions have to be met, because leaders are fully capable of forcing the flock to burn their phones as a ‚Äúhotbed of sin and depravity‚Äù, and in some countries live according to Shariah.  However, gadgets help Muslims determine the direction for namaz, and the Orthodox are looking for the second half on dating sites. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/157/fef/d01/157fefd01fbe1f261f8ff6511feaa59d.jpg" alt="image"><br>  <i>Casio Muslim Watch with Prayer Compass</i> <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Religious gadget can be called and the rosary, but here we will focus on electronic devices.  In the 1990s, Casio <a href="https://geektimes.ru/company/medgadgets/blog/252900/">introduced</a> a whole range of smart watches of a different nature - it was a watch with a remote control for a TV and stereo system, a watch with a calculator, a phone book, a notebook and an organizer, a heart rate monitor, a thermal scanner and an ultraviolet sensor. <br><br>  One of the Casio devices had a compass, but he pointed to Mecca - it is important for Muslims to pray this way.  The watch was called Casio CPW-100 Prayer Compass.  The company now sells watches of this type.  On the website of the company there are <a href="http://www.casio-intl.com/asia-mea/en/wat/prayercompass/">new models</a> from this line.

The same functionality is available on the <a href="http://eqibla.com/">eQibla</a> website. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/26e/6aa/157/26e6aa157a47a1863e6a28708d274d3d.png"><br><br>  Today, a separate gadget is no longer needed, since there is <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/ipray-prayer-times-qibla-compass/id288054534%3Fmt%3D8">an iPray application</a> and similar ones, like the <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/ru/app/qibla-mecca-locator/id453950051%3Fmt%3D8">Qibla Mecca Locator</a> . <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/3dc/da6/2b1/3dcda62b1edc0cd74a672bf1a7ae0d0c.jpg" width="600" alt="image"><br><br>  Various applications are <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/ru/app/muslim-pro-vrema-molitv-azan/id388389451%3Fmt%3D8">reminiscent of the time for prayer</a> and are even capable of reading some of them instead of the master.  The portable speaker below reads the Quran in twenty different voice readers in 20 languages. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/d29/f96/626/d29f96626d3d9187b3633feee15ed6e3.jpg"><br><br>  In 2013, Zakir Naik, an Islamic leader from India, introduced the Peace Mobile smartphone.  The 4.63-inch gadget contains more than 50 authentic Islamic applications, 200 ringtones and more than 80 hours of video with speeches by Zakir Naik himself.  And, of course, the Koran.  I still could not understand whether it is still being sold, because the latest news on the site dates back to August 14, 2014, when Peace Mobile was available at a price of $ 150. <br><br>  The characteristics for that year are average: 4 GB of internal memory, SD support up to 32 GB, 2 SIM cards, 5 megapixel camera with autofocus. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/PuTudkioRgw" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/e27/a23/f53/e27a23f538296a0218b0fec1c8fdc30b.jpg" width="600" alt="image"><br><br>  For Muslims, they have developed a doorbell, which, instead of the usual sounds, says ‚ÄúAs-salamu alaikum.  Peace to you".  Another <a href="https://www.simplyislam.com/islamic-door-chime-remember-allah-everytime-you-open-the-door-islamic-electronics-azan-clock-63281.html">call</a> worth six euros each time recalls the name of Allah. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/G5gu4AmfXew" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  A special pen should help in studying the Qur'an.  Such devices are used for children's books and in museums to help the visually impaired, the elderly and children. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/p5ggQv3SXfk" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  In 2015, Eldar Klychev from Makhachkala developed a concept touch pad for performing namaz.  Every day, a faithful Muslim performs five prayer times, and such a rug will help not to lose the score.  As soon as the user gets off the pace - the rug vibrates.  The number of bows displays the counter in the corner of the rug.  By August 2015, the Eldar had already sold 50 carpets in his hometown, but it <a href="https://www.facebook.com/techstartrussia/posts/894371613971139">expects</a> to cover 1% of the total market size of 1.6 billion Muslims.  There is no news about this device since the fall of 2015, I did not find it on sale. <br><br>  A similar device <a href="http://www.vesti.ru/doc.html%3Fid%3D32458%26cid%3D9">was introduced</a> in 2003 by the inventor from Jordan, but it did not receive distribution. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/86b/7f5/640/86b7f5640546707076561dd48bfd19f2.jpg" width="600" alt="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/bb1/8ca/a4f/bb18caa4f94c6555c53d972d8f0a09c0.jpg" width="600" alt="image"><br><br>  In Orthodoxy, you only need to cover the hair in the church, and in Islam women should wear a headscarf everywhere except at home.  The traditional headscarf in the West is called the hijab.  To tie the hijab, use needles. <br><br>  A Muslim from Brooklyn decided to correct this problem and developed a needleless hijab that allows using a single knot to tie a scarf in twenty different ways and the fabric of which does not wrinkle.  In addition to this, holes are made in the hijab for comfortable wearing of headphones, glasses or a stethoscope. <br><br>  The project on <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/442004559/the-hijab-lab-innovative-hijab-for-muslim-women%3Fref%3Dcategory_recommended">Kickstarter</a> collected about one and a half thousand dollars out of the required eight thousand, until the end of the crowdfunding, 29 days left. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/hiSU1qArAJs" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  The Christian world is more tolerant of technology and to a greater degree uses the achievements of civilization, originally intended for a wide range of people, regardless of religion.  But special devices are trying to sell here.  In 2012, the United States announced the Edify tablet with a pre-installed Bible.  Of course, the browser - with a safe search that protects the potential owner, who may be a child, from the corrupting influence of dangerous sites on the Internet. <br><br>  In fact, the American family bookshop chain Family Christian took a tablet at that time two years ago - Cydle Multipad M7 of 2010 with 8 GB of memory, 512 MB of RAM and a 7-inch 800x480 display - and loaded 27 Bible translations into it.  The gadget was sold in this network of bookstores as the ‚Äúfirst Christian tablet‚Äù for the price of 150 dollars. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ave4heup_MY" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/01e/d4f/bdc/01ed4fbdc015510a49a865ec79106a8d.jpg" width="600" alt="image"><br><br>  The proliferation of smartphones has led to the creation of a huge number of religious applications.  Only <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details%3Fid%3Dcom.sirma.mobile.bible.android">on Android</a> , the Bible app has been downloaded by more than 200 million people.  However, not everyone is happy with the translation of the application into Russian. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/7cd/f75/1f9/7cdf751f912c1b07c2209f4c93d2587c.png" width="600" alt="image"><br><br>  One of the examples of developing an application for a local organization is I Trebs, which allows you to send requirements to the Upper Pechersk Monastery.  Services in the application have been described in detail, the fee for them was removed from the card.  After the execution, the push notification came to the smartphone.  According to the information preserved in the network, the usual requiem cost 33 rubles, demands - from 100 rubles, prayers for eternal commemoration while serving in the temple - 4490 rubles. <br><br>  Without the application, such requirements are submitted in the form of handwritten notes in the temple.  Here orders were received by the vicar of the monastery, he printed them out and also transferred them to the church shop.  In my subjective opinion, this application is a great and convenient thing, but because of a debate on morality, ethics and religion, it was removed from iTunes. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/2e6/d80/456/2e6d804566d4337053b0c7ac5e16ed4e.jpg"><br><br>  In total, Orthodox Christians can fast more than two hundred days a year.  This depends, among other things, on the state of health of the fasting person and on the extent to which the person has a difficult job.  One of the key factors is health: fasting should not be harmful, no one forces fasting to an ulcer.  In order for food to be complete, while refusing meat, fish, seafood, and sour milk products, you need to find <a href="https://play.google.com/store/books/details%3Fid%3DVuSiAQAAQBAJ">appropriate recipes</a> .  The stores for Android and iOS have a lot of similar literature on religious topics. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/0ed/ab7/5b0/0edab75b09fc72f9a6ffe9358be3b2de.png"><br><br>  The <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/ru/app/molitvoslov-hd/id551989882%3Fmt%3D8">Orthodox Prayer Book</a> application contains 400 prayers arranged according to time and subject. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/25d/928/7da/25d9287da548cf332a7aedd8af937f0c.png"><br><br>  There are even Orthodox dating sites like Sudba.net, which worked from 2004 until recently (for some reason now closed) and the <a href="http://www.chayka.org.ru/meet/index.html%3FPHPSESSID%3D8a0c2f089c13b3f128a193ee5f83963e">section</a> on Chayka.org.ru. <br><br>  Dating sites offer and <a href="http://nikah.su/">Muslims</a> .  On the website following the link, a Muslim man can offer a meeting with witnesses to the girl she likes.  More than 23 thousand people are registered on the site. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/e87/007/603/e870076039b9a061d915598aa9cd9e52.jpg"><br><br>  For orthodox Jews, it is not acceptable to use non-kosher devices.  An illustrative <a href="https://www.ridus.ru/news/160576.html">incident</a> occurred in 2014 when rabbis of the Haredy community during a religious holiday recognized the iPhone as evil and burned it for promoting pornography, gossip and encouraging the vices of society.  Interestingly, the process of burning smartphones recorded on the same smartphones.  This video is worth seeing, people are lit with great music. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/_woIxNqdeIs" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  Religions have various limitations that relate to information consumed by a person.  For example, a faithful Muslim should not look at pornography.  Special search engines for Muslims and Jews, as a rule, take the issue of Google and filter it for users.  One of the first halal search engines was ImHalal, it began operating in September 2009 and <a href="http://imhalal.com/">closed in 2011</a> .  He was replaced by the current search engine <a href="http://halalgoogling.com/">Halalgoogling.com</a> . <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/d87/83c/6d9/d8783c6d97bebe9532fb27cc283c3652.png"><br><br>  For Orthodox Jews, in 2009 they launched the search engine <a href="http://www.koogle.co.il/">www.koogle.co.il</a> .  Even ordinary photographs of women cannot be shown to users, so they were blocked at the issue level.  Also, the search engine did not allow to see prohibited items like televisions, audio equipment and other things that hinder the study of the Torah.  The search engine did not work on Shabbos - on Saturdays.  Today it is disabled altogether. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/a16/64a/4d6/a1664a4d614a533e3935d46f38d7283b.jpg"><br><br>  Religions throughout the history of mankind influenced life, science, technological advances.  At some times they obstructed science, at others they served as its stronghold, like monasteries in Russia, in which it was possible to learn at least reading and writing.  Now in the foreground in many countries ‚Äúatheist‚Äù gadgets from the world of capitalism and commerce have come out, but even they find the approach to the most conservative religious trends.  Today, instead of trying to create gadgets aimed at religion, they often release applications for devices popular in the market: for example, an application instead of a keychain compass pointing towards Mecca.  The only exception is Orthodox Jews who prefer to burn gadgets. <br><br>  What examples of gadgets and services that are highly specialized for religious affiliation?  If you are a religious person, do you use such things? </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/394401/">https://habr.com/ru/post/394401/</a></p>
