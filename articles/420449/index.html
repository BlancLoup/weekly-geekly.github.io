It is <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-08-15/tesla-drops-on-report-of-sec-subpoena-over-musk-go-private-plan">reported by</a> Bloomberg. <br><br>  The regulator requested data from each of the directors of the company.  Unfortunately, the media could not get information about exactly what data are of interest to the SEC.  Tesla management does not comment on the situation.  As far as can be understood, the proceedings will take some time, and the case itself has reached a new level. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  The fact that Ilon Musk is thinking about the possibility of selling the company, he said on Twitter.  At the same time, the entrepreneur <a href="https://habr.com/post/420109/">indicated</a> that he was considering this possibility only on condition that the shares were sold at a price of $ 420 per unit.  He also stated that he hoped that investors would remain with the company, and that relations between it and the investors themselves would remain confidential.

      After the announcement (despite the fact that at that time it was only published on Twitter), the company's shares rose by 11%, although they soon fell.  At the time of the announcement of Ilona Mask, the share price was $ 365 per share. <br><br>  Mask and his plans were unhappy with some shareholders of Tesla Inc., who felt that the entrepreneur did not negotiate and did not tell the main details of the case - who exactly is going to buy the company.  If it is Musk himself, then he obviously does not have enough money.  If a third-party person or company is who? <br><br>  It turned out that we are talking about a private fund of Saudi Arabia, which is called the Public Investment Fund (PIF). <br><br>  The trial with the regulator is clearly not at the right time - now Tesla has problems.  For example, the company reported a record loss of $ 717 million in early August.  True, the level of production reached the previously planned volumes - 5,000 electric vehicles per week, so, according to the same Mask, one can hope for the company's profitability by the end of 2018. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/420449/">https://habr.com/ru/post/420449/</a></p>
