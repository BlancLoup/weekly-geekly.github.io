  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Experience using Android 4 on HTC Desire HD</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/151156/">Having played enough and even slightly tormented with the firmware Virtuous Infinity</a> (Android 4.0.3), I decided that it would be enough to endure the thoughtfulness of my phone and it was time to change something in this life.  It was decided to move to Android 4.1, and choose <a href="http://forum.xda-developers.com/showthread.php%3Ft%3D1778202">JellyBean - JELLYTIME for DHD / Inspire4g</a> as the firmware. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  The firmware is based on Cyanogen Mod 10, which implies the absence of Sense and Google applications.  I accepted the first circumstance with joy, and the second easily overcame the installation file downloaded from the firmware branch, in which there are all the gmalts, markets and other gmaps that are dear to my heart. <br>  The firmware and Google applications are easily installed from the zip-archive via recovery - experienced users do not need to explain what it is.  Performance after a rather thick Sense simply struck - everything became so quickly and beautifully.  By default, 2 shells are installed on the system - <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details%3Fid%3Dcom.teslacoilsw.launcher">Nova Launcher</a> and <a href="http://forum.xda-developers.com/showthread.php%3Ft%3D1410674">Trebuchet</a> , by and large - modifications of the standard 4.x interface.  Both were not impressed, so I returned to my favorite <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details%3Fid%3Dcom.gau.go.launcherex">GO Launcherr EX</a> - quickly and beautifully, and you can hide the top from the bottom panel. <br><br>  I had to face a few nuances.  By the way, he didn‚Äôt find out if they are connected to the software or hardware part. <br>  Nuance one: despite the initial ‚Äúclean‚Äù installation (with resetting the phone to factory settings, formatting caches, etc.), the phone restarts with a creak.  That is, we reboot the device, and at the stage of loading it hangs.  Is dead  Only a 5-6 reboot with battery shedding was successful, so rebooting for me was the most unloved thing. <br>  Nuance of the second: when you try to play with the frequencies of the processor - also a deaf hang.  It doesn't matter if you use SetCPU or standard settings for this.  By the way, when I found this setting in the system itself, SetCPU demolished without much pity, the situation with the battery improved. <br>  As it turned out, these two things are interrelated - it is pranks with the frequency of the processor that do not allow the phone to boot normally.  SetCPU demolished, in the standard settings I set the standard frequency range 245-1024MHz, and everything returned to normal. <br><br>  As for the benefits - it is certainly the speed and smoothness of work.  No wonder - such a fat launcher, like Sense, is absent in the system as a class.  Of course, he had a beautiful dialer and an SMS program (as well as combining Facebook and Google contacts into one), but you can live.  In particular, by installing <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details%3Fid%3Dcom.jbapps.contactpro">GO Contacts EX</a> , I found out that I practically did not lose the beauty of the interface.  Particularly interesting, at least for me, looks like a dark theme.

      As I ended up, I got rid of the device hangs with or without.  First, I updated the firmware before this in a ‚Äúdirty‚Äù way - from R11 to R14 without resetting it to the factory settings, but simply rolling a new release over the old one, contrary to the recommendations of the developers.  As a result, I completely removed the ROM from the phone (modified recovery 4ext Recovery Touch allows you to do this), I asked for the new ROM itself, the Google applications and did not touch the processor frequency.  Moreover, there is no difference to the eye when working at 1.4GHz and 1GHz, so why force iron too much? <br><br>  As a summary, I would say that the firmware is noteworthy - the project is actively developing (there were three releases in a week), the firmware itself is fast and economical in terms of resources.  If you do not use Sense, then you can safely put.  Let the speed does not shine (again, if you believe the benchmarks), but it is quite suitable for everyday use.  A screenshot of Antutu Benchmark results is shown below: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/078/6cf/f95/0786cff95eac314b8ee5798ffadefa7d.png"><br><br>  If someone has thoughts about my ordeal with hangs, questions or suggestions, I invite you to talk in the comments. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/153209/">https://habr.com/ru/post/153209/</a></p>
