This method is increasingly used and becomes very popular.  New information found on any site is converted to a specific format called RSS feed.  Thus, these RSS feeds can be read by sites that support RSS or the so-called RSS Readers.  Well-known bloggers and major Internet publications such as The New York Times, Wordpress and Bloglines have been using RSS for several years now, spreading important information to a large number of Internet users. <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  Qlikworld Reader is not just a standard RSS reader.  All functions of addition and removal of tapes by the user are fully observed, but at the same time Qlikworld Reader can use a more extensive resource base, such as media, news, video clips, images, audio files.  By adding RSS feeds on their own, using a lightweight search function that allows you to save entered search queries and link to them, the user can collect the relevant information of interest to him and his resources of interest into a single program.

Any student understands what is at stake.  In Europe, this method is gradually, but all the more quickly finds its use.  Soon RSS will change the way of transferring information and data.  So what, what is RSS feeds? <br><br>  RSS is a combination of letters in abbreviation from English "Really Simple Syndication" or "Rich Site Summary".  Moreover, ‚ÄúReally Simple Syndication‚Äù is considered as the main concept. <br><br>  Using RSS feeds, anyone who has a website on the Internet can spread their news to a wide audience of users around the world.  Visitors to his site using the so-called RSS Reader (also known as News Reader or Feed Reader) or myPLAZOO can subscribe to this news and read it whenever they want.  The information in this format is called RSS feeds.  In Russian - news channels, news feeds. <br>  RSS feed <br><br>  Using RSS feeds allows you to view news from many sites in a short time without wasting time opening each of them.  You do not even need to enter the addresses of these pages, but you just need to run the RSS Reader. <br><br>  Past situation <img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/olpictures/dca/c05/b9b/dcac05b9bd3f625ef70f61faeb210b85.jpg" width="300" height="173" alt="old" hspace="10" vspace="10"><br><br>  Situation now <img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/olpictures/9f2/695/a9f/9f2695a9fcdef6eda8fdd54994bd4347.jpg" width="300" height="150" alt="new" hspace="10" vspace="10"><br><br>  How to find RSS feeds? <br><br>  For example, in PLAZOO: <br><br>  PLAZOO is an information retrieval system.  Just enter the keyword of the topic that interests you.  PLAZOO will give you the appropriate tapes. <br><br>  Currently, RSS news can be found not only on commercial sites, but also on thousands of so-called Blogs (online diaries).  A blog (from a weblog) is a kind of diary on the web, through which a person can tell about himself, communicate with his friends, and also find new ones on the net. <br><br>  Material taken from the site <a href="http://rss-reader.kz/">http://rss-reader.kz</a> <br>  From myself I can add that I downloaded it myself: <a href="http://in-web.kz/%3Fp%3D437">in-web.kz</a> and use it.  I really like. <br>  I can add that the creators made a very good machine.  Constantly listening to the radio, which is in the services of the reader.  about 50 channels. Choose according to your taste and color. <br>  I think it is worthwhile to try first, and then use it in different guises: as a program for the user and as a platform for the company. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/28425/">https://habr.com/ru/post/28425/</a></p>
