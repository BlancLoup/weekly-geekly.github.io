  <section class="page js-page"><h1>If without a car in any way, or savior-Autostart</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  I bought before the new year Hyundai Solaris 2011 release.  The machine is super, only the first owner of the battery, as it seemed to me, did not change.  Before Christmas, there were frosts under thirty.  I took care of the car.  When the frost subsided, I had to go on business.  I sat behind the wheel, put in the ignition key, turned it, but instead of the pleasant hum of the engine, I heard a relay crackling and blinking lights.  The trip did not work.  To charge the battery, it was necessary to unscrew the nut at 13, located near the bottom of the battery and fixing the battery in a stationary state.  Do not crawl by hand, I did not have a key for 13 with an extension handle.  In the nearest auto parts store for such "adaptive" I was offered to pay 700 rubles.  The key at once I refused to buy.  I wrote a letter to Dadzhet with a proposal to test <a href="https://dadget.ru/pusko-zaryadnoe-ustroistvo-dla-avtomobilya/avtostart/%3Futm_referrer%3Dgeektimes.ru%26utm_source%3Dgeektimes.ru%26utm_medium%3Darticle%26utm_term%3Davtostart%26utm_content%3Davtostart%26utm_campaign%3Davtostart_488">Autostart</a> , and on the same day I received a positive response! <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/d70/edd/5c4/d70edd5c405f4825a8a4e5ed182e311e.jpg"><br><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  I read the reviews before, but it seemed to me that they were some kind of laboratory ones.  I did not find any real tests.  And I decided to write and make a video about how Autostart actually behaves on a discharged battery in the cold. <br>  GT already had reviews of Autostart <a href="https://geektimes.ru/company/dadget/blog/250976/">1</a> , <a href="https://geektimes.ru/company/dadget/blog/245582/">2</a> , <a href="https://geektimes.ru/company/dadget/blog/243221/">3</a> , so I omit some questions to avoid repetitions.  The device is sold for several years, and the demand for it does not decrease, I think. <br>  I'll just remind you what its packaging looks like.

To turn it on, you need to hold a single button for a second.  The option is very convenient when you have to climb under the hood in the dark. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/643/0ed/b04/6430edb04dce485ebf6bb76cb5742327.jpg"><br><br>  Hold for a second, the flashlight turns off. <br><br>  On the car was installed alarm Scher-Khan Magicar 8. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/7c2/161/7a8/7c21617a818f4a5cbbc2ed3ca23b9e8d.jpg"><br><br>  Two consoles, tracking and control from a distance of up to 2 kilometers were very convenient for me.  Why did I mention the alarm, and tell you a little later. <br><br>  But back to our "sheep".  Opened the hood: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/6ce/05c/671/6ce05c671f5f47dcb565f776123a7c40.jpg"><br><br>  Connected autostart <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/ca9/a21/e96/ca9a21e964344bc29314aeb055009bd6.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/786/f80/89e/786f8089e7464f8f83a27b2fd820a494.jpg"><br><br>  As soon as I connected the Auto Start to the battery terminals, the starter started working, although the ignition key was not in the extreme right position, and the engine did not want to start.  After checking the fuses, I realized that the alarm was blocking the supply of high voltage to the plugs.  Or maybe you just had to turn the key?  But then I would probably have damaged the starter gear.  But I was alone, and I can not say about it.  I had to turn off the alarm system. When I used the Startup, I opened and closed the car with multlock. <br><br>  Repeating all the procedures with the alarm off, everything went as it should! <br>  Turning the ignition key, the engine started! <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/d07/0c6/974/d070c697456f4282adc07574e6634a50.jpg"><br><br>  A two-minute video shot "in the same breath," I attach.  It was cold.  Fingers do not bend.  Time lost.  Mat had to erase.  From 18+ video became 0+. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/o9VvcctZ8gY" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  I charge the autostart from the cigarette lighter in the car.  But I don‚Äôt leave him in the glove box, I carry it with me in my inner warm jacket pocket.  Many motorists carry documents in a man purse.  Autostart can be worn there.  If the car owner spent 5-10 minutes in the cold, before starting, I advise you to warm the Autostart with your armpit, in another convenient place or sit on it. <br><br>  Autostart has an "eye" with four sectors. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/25f/89d/6a2/25f89d6a25784e71b4cafe974674a8f8.jpg"><br><br>  When everything is burning, it means that Autostart has a full charge.  Charge the smartphone from Autostart to me as it still seems wonderful, I charge from normal charging, but as an option, why not! <br><br><h3>  findings </h3><br>  I wondered how many ‚Äúfactories‚Äù would have been enough for Avtostart.  For seven days, every day I started a car.  Then I did not have enough, to be honest.  The thesis of the manufacturer ‚Äúenough for up to 10 times‚Äù was completely justified. <br><br>  Those who are interested in buying have the opportunity <a href="https://dadget.ru/pusko-zaryadnoe-ustroistvo-dla-avtomobilya/avtostart/%3Futm_referrer%3Dgeektimes.ru%26utm_source%3Dgeektimes.ru%26utm_medium%3Darticle%26utm_term%3Davtostart%26utm_content%3Davtostart%26utm_campaign%3Davtostart_488">to buy Autostart</a> at a price of 4041 rubles, and not 4490 rubles.  (excluding delivery).  To do this, when ordering, write a promotional code GEEKT-AF (10% discount). <br><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Information for bloggers and authors</b> <div class="spoiler_text">  The company "Dadzhet" is interested in publishing independent objective reviews of dadzhetov in various kinds of media and is happy to provide dadzhetov bloggers and authors who want to test them and write a review. <br><br>  The device after writing a review remains with the author.
