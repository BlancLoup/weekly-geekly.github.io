  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Work on the result</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Motivation for "work on the result" - a common practice of business manipulation.  This is one of the most effective ways, for example, for a higher manager to keep controllability of subordinate units.  More precisely, this is a convenient way to ‚Äúpoke a finger‚Äù into the holes in the business process, which the downstream manager had to close.  No result - no premium.  No result - it means that a person in vain takes his place.  <i>If your goal, your concern, or even the dream of your life, is ‚ÄúResult,‚Äù it means that you are concentrating on what you cannot control, and you are missing out on what you can control.</i> <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Of course, the work on the ‚ÄúResult‚Äù is a beautiful idea, it allows you to rush to the embrasure, solve problems by cutting them like a Gordian knot, try to make the business profitable at the price of constant stress.  For many, this is generally the only acceptable way of doing business.  From the point of view of a higher management, visually visible ‚Äúhyperactivity‚Äù of an employee can be a good example to follow for others.  Nevertheless, it makes sense to <i>stop worrying about victory and concentrate on the basic principles of reasonable and careful decision making.</i> <br><br>  Moreover, working on the ‚ÄúResult‚Äù creates a false sense of ‚Äúneed.‚Äù  Acting in this way, I would begin to need approval from top management, need to conclude transactions, need to launch a project, need a specific result.  I myself would put myself in a subordinate position, which means <i>I would begin to worry, lose control and make wrong decisions</i> .  I would start thinking not about what I really have and manage (strictly limited human and material resources), but about how to fulfill the requirement of leadership.  From the point of view of controllability by subordinates, this is fine, but from the point of view of strong and independent business units within one company, this is ‚Äúnothing.‚Äù  <i>Unnecessary fear to make a bad decision is the main obstacle to successful solutions</i> .  In fact, I do not need approval, a deal, or a project launch.  On the contrary, this company needs me - self-assured, independent, cynical and rude type - because only such people survive in business. <br><br>  The task of the executive head is to build mechanisms that function as a Swiss watch and are resistant to influences both from the outside and from the inside.  Friendly projects, the next ‚Äúhigher priority‚Äù tasks, the subjective opinion of the management - all this should be politely postponed and put in the queue of the technological process.  For an untrained person, all this looks like an abstraction, as opposed to "Result" - apparently tangible.  As a rule, this is primarily cash money coming into the budget.

      Nevertheless, these abstractions are the very factor of control on which the leader should be concentrated.  The head should be able, without being distracted by the solution of operational problems, for months or years to build processes painstakingly.  Not yielding to provocations like ‚Äúyou can‚Äôt adjust everything in the world‚Äù, because the ‚ÄúResult‚Äù on the place of chaos and stress cannot be tuned all the more.  Try to <i>focus on goals and behaviors that you can control, and not be attached to results that you cannot control</i> . <br><br>  The ‚ÄúResult‚Äù is especially strongly oriented towards commercial service employees.  The result - to make a deal, enter into a contract.  Whoever has ever been in a situation where sales were selling a project, and the technical department had no idea how to implement it, he would think twice before repeating the same mistake. <br><br>  <i>Italics</i> are highlighted quotes from the book "First, say no," Jim Camp. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/43263/">https://habr.com/ru/post/43263/</a></p>
