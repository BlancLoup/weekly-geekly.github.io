  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Update stereotypes: how emodzhi help reproduce scenarios of non-verbal communication online</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  At first glance, this is a rather funny paradox: are social networks being created by asocial people?  At least, they are antipodes to the stereotype perception of the target audience of their projects: Jack Dorsey does not look like a troll, Pavel Durov is like a schoolboy <s>, Mark Zuckerberg is like a person</s> .  My sample is small and may turn out to be completely unrepresentative at the end, but this is not important, because the connection between online text communication and geek / introverts is deeper than just a tradition that has been preserved since the voice was easier to transmit by taking a modem line with ordinary home phone than on the Internet. <br><br>  Human communication since the ancestors of man first spoke something articulate, was conducted in two languages: human, in which words are used for information exchange (verbal communication), and much more ancient than people, body language, in which information transmitted by behavior (non-verbal). <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/af/pj/_z/afpj_z2yzc3gwvda_hn_pw30jta.jpeg"><br>  <i>Sir Patrick Stewart, as it were, calls this picture not to be judged immediately by the cover.</i>

      However, they were not always given to people with the same success: in each, probably, the class had its own nerves - children, who, usually, were worse than others, were given normal communication, but better - learning.  Both, apparently, for one reason: the balance of understanding of verbal and non-verbal language was clearly biased in favor of the first - as a result, these children, looking at the book, saw in it, in fact, letters, words, and worth the meaning behind them - whereas adding a stream of incoming non-verbal information did not help to understand the interlocutor, but only obscured their meaning and required a small delay in processing all signals at the level of consciousness, earning a reputation as being inhibited among other children who had non-verbal signals processed  omentalno on a subconscious level. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  However, although it was not very pleasant to be considered a brake, the speed of the informal and non-verbal contacts of the other children who instantly found a common language with each other with little or no words, I never envied, and I would never change with them because the subconscious information processing means the subconscious, in other words - an emotional reaction.  No, thanks, I better understand what is happening - or rather, it happened and it was already over while I was slowing down. <br><br>  Text Web has changed everything.  There were, of course, still text messages, but 70 characters with abc-dials were not enough to feel the paradigm shift. <br><br>  Online text communication is another matter: purely verbal communication without interference and distortion introduced by a non-verbal signal that is absent as a class ‚Äî and even in live chat a small delay in consciously processing incoming information did not turn into an awkward pause like in live conversation. <br><br>  Meanwhile, the Internet has become democratized. <br><br>  For most people, nonverbalics were still (as they still are) necessary and integral, like a chromosome, an element of full communication.  People, part of a healthy communication for whom it was possible to see (or at least hear, speaking on the phone) the non-verbal reaction of the interlocutor, were left alone with these scary letters, disoriented without the emotional information they needed - until bunnies came to the rescue. <br><br><h2>  When it's time to understand and forgive: emoji </h2><br>  That's right: emoticons - it was not only fun, it was necessary - a channel for non-verbal information appeared in verbal communication, at least in the most exaggerated form.  Emoji, who extruded them from colloquial speech, is even a more successful name, because it quite accurately reflects the essence and purpose of this hieroglyphic writing. <br><br>  Perhaps, emodzhi serve as an adaptation mechanism for the transition to the verbal communication space - as a crutch for a person who is learning to walk again after a back injury. <br><br>  On the other hand, it‚Äôs not less likely that Emodzhi is with us to stay - this scenario is evidenced by the fact that the verbal communication space is expanding not so much now as by the exchange of information, including Apple animation, voice messages (I hate), videotapes , story, stream etc. <br><br><h2>  Is it bad or good? </h2><br>  In my opinion, absolutely good. <br><br>  <b>First, technology for people, not people for technology.</b>  I don‚Äôt see anything good from forcing people to function in an unnatural environment for them - I have a strong suspicion that a significant part of trash communication that has filled all boards and Internet comments is, in many ways, the effect of disorientation of people in the verbal space without nonverbal prompts, without which people just lose their sense of balance in the dialogue, lounging, as a result, in a bunch on each other.  Obviously from the same category and the well-known observation that a personal meeting reduces the degree of aggression compared to the intensity of passions in the network: no shit, Sherlock, in person meeting you already a person and his emotions, the process of unconsciously recognizing which - including the moment when it is time to stop escalation, for example - honed millions of years of evolution. <br><br>  Therefore, it‚Äôs okay if many people, for a few years or never, may never be able to switch to purely verbal communication - let them use emoji, animoji, send <br>  voice and video chat, who needs it - and at the same time I will continue to write in letters, avoiding even more brackets to simulate a smile, because I understand that if it makes the communication of other users more efficient, it will make the communication of all users more efficient. <br><br>  This is an important lesson for corporations too.  Perhaps in order to turn comments on YouTube from gladiatorial battles at a dump near Moscow into something healthier, they should replace text messages with video messages - and people, starting to see each other, will suddenly ... well, better than just people they will not - but this, judging by the average temperature in the hospital on the Internet today, will be an unprecedented miracle.  Try to return to the commentators the human appearance, showing their human appearance. <br><br>  Secondly, if people need emodzhi for audio communication, audio and video, then the news here is that <b>people can communicate normally on the network</b> ;  that people do not degrade at all, that emodzhi is not proof of dullness, comments are not evidence of brutality, that we will not switch to the language of pictograms, hieroglyphs and pantomimes in any foreseeable future, and the Internet as a whole is not a sentence of civilization, not a collective Mr. Hyde humanity - but just another tool, and another opportunity for people to get to know themselves better. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/442062/">https://habr.com/ru/post/442062/</a></p>
