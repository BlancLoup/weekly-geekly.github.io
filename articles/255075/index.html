      Project <a href="http://love2code.ru/">Love2Code.ru</a> .  There is an opinion that programming is the lot of stern men with a mathematical education, uncommunicative and unfriendly.  This course we are trying to dispel this myth and show that programming is an exciting creative activity that is accessible to everyone!  Moreover, the main goal of our course is to love programming, and were able to solve practical problems with it. <br><br> <a href="http://love2code.ru/"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/aa5/115/bc0/aa5115bc0fb645fea5743dcf8b2b776d.jpg"></a> <br><br>  The course is built around the creation of mobile applications - using simple applications as an example, we tell about important programming concepts in simple and accessible form: variables, cycles, functions ... And every time we learn a new concept, we add something new to our application. <br><br>  In addition to the actual theoretical lectures and practical examples, we also included in the course videos from various successful women, one way or another connected with IT.  From them you will hear why it is important to program, how it can change your life, and how pleasant it is to do this most creative activity! <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  <strong>Hit!</strong>  <strong>For beginners.</strong>  <a href="http://www.microsoftvirtualacademy.com/training-courses/fundamentals-of-developing-websites-and-web-applications-rus">Basics of developing websites and web applications</a> <br><br>  This course, designed for beginners, gives a complete overview of web programming technologies: from the basics of the Internet and HTML / CSS markup languages, to web programming on the client (Javascript) and on the server (C #, ASP.NET).  At the same time, we do not go into any of the technologies in sufficient detail, leaving the reader with an opportunity to study in more detail the sections he liked during the individual courses. <br><br>  The course is based on using WebMatrix, a handy web page editing tool.  Some familiarity with the basics of C # programming will be useful for getting acquainted with the course, but this is not mandatory. <br><br><h3>  Cloud! </h3><br>  <a href="http://www.microsoftvirtualacademy.com/training-courses/using-docker-containers-in-iaas-azure-rus">Using Docker Containers in Azure IaaS Cloud</a> <br><br>  The course covers the issues of the device management system Docker containers and its use in IaaS-type cloud systems.  A brief overview and comparison of various virtualization, emulation, and containerization systems, such as KVM, Xen, OpenVZ, LXC, and others, has been done.  The virtualization system at the LXC operating system level is currently used as the base system for Docker.  The issues of practical application of Docker, its main functions are covered. <br><br>  The practical part of the module shows how to place an application in a container or a number of interconnected Docker containers, and how these containers are managed: create, delete, start, stop and restart, and also link containers together.  In addition, the integration of the Docker container management system and the IaaS type of cloud service is considered: launching a host system to run containers with the ability to manage containers from the outside.  CoreOS is considered as the base operating system, Microsoft Azure as the cloud system. <br><br>  <a href="http://www.microsoftvirtualacademy.com/training-courses/recovery-and-high-availability-of-applications-and-services-rus">Providing resiliency and high availability of applications and services</a> <br><br>  The course examines the Microsoft approach to building disaster-resistant and high-availability systems, as well as the technologies and services underlying this approach.  You will learn how to use the Azure Site Recovery cloud service to protect virtual machines (VM), manage asynchronous VM replication between data centers, orchestrate the process of switching to a backup data center in the event of an accident or during scheduled work.  You do not have a backup datacenter?  Now Microsoft Azure can play its role.  Using Azure Site Recovery, you can configure VM replication directly to the Microsoft cloud.  It also covers other technologies for high availability and disaster recovery, including clustering and Windows Server Backup. <br><br>  <a href="http://www.microsoftvirtualacademy.com/training-courses/getting-started-with-microsoft-azure-active-directory">Getting Started with Microsoft Azure Active Directory</a> <br><br>  <a href="http://www.microsoftvirtualacademy.com/training-courses/managing-your-systems-on-microsoft-azure-with-chef">Manage your Azure cloud systems with Chef</a> <br><br>  <a href="http://www.microsoftvirtualacademy.com/training-courses/polyglot-persistence-choosing-the-right-azure-storage-mix">Choosing the right storage for data in Azure</a> <br><br>  <a href="http://www.microsoftvirtualacademy.com/training-courses/microsoft-azure-fundamentals-storage-and-data">The basics of Azure.</a>  <a href="http://www.microsoftvirtualacademy.com/training-courses/microsoft-azure-fundamentals-storage-and-data">Storage and data storage</a> <br><br>  <a href="http://www.microsoftvirtualacademy.com/training-courses/open-source-database-on-microsoft-azure">Work with open databases in the Microsoft Azure cloud</a> <br><br><h3>  Game development! </h3><br>  <a href="http://www.microsoftvirtualacademy.com/training-courses/developing-advanced-2d-games-with-html5">Development of complex 2D games on HTML5</a> <br><br>  <a href="http://www.microsoftvirtualacademy.com/training-courses/construct-2-advanced-game-development">Development of complex games with Construct 2</a> <br><br>  <a href="http://www.microsoftvirtualacademy.com/training-courses/developing-games-with-marmalade-and-c-for-windows-and-windows-phone">Game development on Marmalade and C ++ on Windows and Windows Phone</a> <br><br><h3>  Application Development </h3><br>  <a href="http://www.microsoftvirtualacademy.com/training-courses/a-developers-guide-to-windows-10-preview">Windows 10 Developer's Guide</a> <br><br>  <strong>Fast start.</strong>  <a href="http://www.microsoftvirtualacademy.com/training-courses/mean-stack-jump-start">Development on a stack of MongoDB, Express, AngularJS, Node.js (MEAN)</a> <br><br>  <a href="http://www.microsoftvirtualacademy.com/training-courses/cloud-enable-a-windows-presentation-foundation-lob-app">WPF-based cloud-based business applications</a> <br><br>  <a href="http://www.microsoftvirtualacademy.com/training-courses/managing-the-application-lifecycle-with-msdn">Application Lifecycle Management with MSDN</a> <br><br>  <a href="http://www.microsoftvirtualacademy.com/training-courses/practical-performance-tips-to-make-your-html-javascript-fast">HTML / JS optimization tips</a> <br><br><h3>  Work with data </h3><br>  <strong>Fast start.</strong>  <a href="http://www.microsoftvirtualacademy.com/training-courses/you-ve-got-key-values-a-redis-jump-start">Work with Redis</a> <br><br><h3>  Infrastructure </h3><br>  <a href="http://www.microsoftvirtualacademy.com/training-courses/windows-to-go">Windows To Go</a> <br><br>  Windows To Go Technology (WTG) - allows you to create a properly configured OS image with the necessary software installed, which will be downloaded directly from USB media, regardless of which OS is installed on the computer to which this USB media is connected.
