  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Are you a credit card or not a credit card? ..</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Looking through various forums, I repeatedly came across stormy discussions about what a ‚Äúcredit card‚Äù is and in what cases it is in fact ‚Äúcredit‚Äù or ‚Äúdebit‚Äù.  I will try, if possible, <a name="habracut"></a>  reveal to the habrasoobshchestvom this question. <br><br>  So, a payment card is, in fact, a tool for managing an account.  That is - by paying in a store with a card, you thereby give your bank an order - ‚Äútransfer, my friend, such a sum to the account of such a store‚Äù.  Where to transfer?  Of course, from your account. <br><br>  In the bank that issued the card, one or several SCS - specialized card accounts are opened and tied to the card.  When are there several?  Well, for example, in the case of multicurrency cards, when several accounts are opened in different currencies and the rules are set, ‚Äúif a request comes in for a currency in which there is an account, write off it, and if there is not enough money, then others.  Sometimes the cardholder is given the opportunity to establish these rules himself, sometimes not, this is determined by the internal rules of the bank. <br>  Consider the most popular options: <br><ol><li>  Debit card.  The simplest option, the card holder can only dispose of the amount previously deposited in his account and go beyond this limit, he has no right. </li><li>  Overdraft debit card.  This is a slightly more complicated option, on such a card the holder is allowed to ‚Äúgo into the minus‚Äù within the credit line.  In this case, on the bank side, in this case, a separate credit account can be opened, and the usual customer account can be used - it depends on the accounting technologies in a particular bank. </li><li>  "Real" credit card.  Such a card is tied directly to the credit account and all funds spent on this card will always be bank money.  Even if you repay the amount of the debt by the next repayment of the loan, the surplus will simply fall into a separate account, from which the subsequent debts will be paid later. </li></ol>

      <i>By the way, you can ‚Äúgo into the minus‚Äù, including by the debit card itself.</i>  <i>Such a situation is called ‚Äútechnical overdraft‚Äù and may arise if there is a shortage of funds to pay any commission or payment of a payment claim.</i>  <i>Such cases are always provided by the bank in the card agreement and are usually punished with interest charged up to the skies.</i> <br><br>  A set of opened accounts, rules for working with them - are determined by each specific bank for each specific product at its discretion.  Thus, from the side of the cardholder it is far from always at all possible to determine by whose money ‚Äî the client or the bank ‚Äî this particular calculation is carried out.  Accordingly, it is difficult to say whether a loan was granted. <br><br>  But what about the level of the map - will a habraiser ask me?  How are all these "classics", "golds", "platinum"?  What is determined by them? <br>  The answer will be very simple - they determine the level of trust.  In cases where authorization is not possible (for example, you pay with a card in duty-free on board the aircraft, or on a ship on a cruise in the middle of the Atlantic) - the limit is determined at the discretion of the seller (or his bank).  It is clear that in this case the level of confidence in the owner of ‚Äúplatinum‚Äù and, accordingly, the amount limit will be higher than for the owner of ‚Äúclassic‚Äù.  For owners of Electron / Maestro cards, however, offline operations are impossible at all. <br><br>  But at the same time - inside the bank "electron" can easily be tied to a credit account with a credit line of one million bucks, and "platinum" - to a debit account with zero overdraft, on which lies two hundred rubles. <br><br>  Thus, it is incorrect to speak about the "credit" of one or another abstract card.  Credit may or may not be a specific product of a particular bank. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/87008/">https://habr.com/ru/post/87008/</a></p>
