  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Parable about the moron</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  There was a righteous man.  He was poor, b-obeyed and law-abiding.  And Gd decided to reward him.  Yavilso told him in the form of a burning cactus and said with a human voice something like ‚Äúask, man, what do you want.‚Äù  "And give me, God, everything, on a par with others?" - He answered the man. <a name="habracut"></a>  And it became with him on a par with everyone.  On corn tortillas and a dressing gown from the flea market he had for himself, and for numerous children, and for mistresses, and even halvah was on holidays on holidays.  But, despite the fact that his life has changed dramatically, he continued to be a b-fearing and law-abiding human being.  And again Gd revealed to him.  At this time, in the form of a talking sheep, or another cattle - no one really remembers.  And he says, they say, ask again what you want, you are very sympathetic to me.  Well, the man scratched his beard, said, give me just two times more than everyone.  The sheep grunted and nodded.  And the man became even steeper all.  He brought himself several sheep there, cheese on the table almost every day, the children are joyful and rounded, he even sent an older one to study.  And, although he didn‚Äôt have time for all the business concerns of such a zealous service to Gd, he continued to zealously keep the fast, to perform the evening prayer after the mullah‚Äôs first cry, and in general, became a benefactor and honorable husband - rich, b-God-fearing, and sometimes to a beggar a copper will give, and is hospitable, and affable, and dressed well.  And for the third time, Gd showed him that Gd, guvorite, they say, you nichrome type.  Awesome you type.  Ask again what you want.  "And I want, God, so that I have four times more of everything than everyone else," he answers. <br>  And he had only four times as much - four x% I, eight legs and eight arms.  Gd alone left his head alone, motivating it with the fact that he does not intend to produce morons, one will suffice. </div>
