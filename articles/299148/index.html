Some mysterious chemical reaction that may arise as a result of an emotional outburst associated with the product. </li><li>  Consumer insights are the real reasons for choosing your product in specific conditions by a specific buyer. </li></ul>

      In a word, in order to achieve the occurrence of customer insight, we need to form a correct and interesting proposal.  For this, it is worth going deep into studying your audience with the help of Google Analytics. <br><br>  Knowing the sources of traffic to the site (direct, social networks, organic, paid, etc.) is very important.  An overview of channel traffic can help a business determine if these channels are worth the money and marketing efforts.  For example, is there any use of posts on social networks?  Does the quantity and quality of these posts affect the site's incoming traffic?  Does organic traffic increase after every change and addition to SEO optimization?  Information of this kind will never be useful, if we consider the traffic of the site only from the position of its presence in principle. <br>  On the other hand, the source of the traffic determines the goals of the site visitors.  And if there is knowledge of the goals of users, it will not be difficult to provide them with useful content for holding and maintaining interest. <br><br>  An ordinary Google Analytics user will log into a personal account;  will see that the total traffic goes up and calm down.  But from Google Analytics you can get a lot more useful knowledge to determine the needs, goals and motives of users of the site. <br><br>  <b><u>1. Using audience data to segment visitors</u></b> <br><br>  The fact that in the process of creating the concept of the site, its content and functionality it is necessary to build on the target audience, even a novice entrepreneur knows.  Google Analytics allows you to more accurately determine <b>who the main visitors of the site are and what their interests are</b> .  To get data, open the dashboard of interests in your personal account: <b>Reports - Audience - Interests</b> . <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/26f/0be/cec/26f0bececced4dca8c5f14795aca03e8.jpg"><br><br>  Based on the results of the report, we see that visitors to our site are interested in technology.  And the audience closest to our market is interested in business and marketing services. <br><br>  To find out the <b>age and gender of the target audience</b> , open the report <b>Audience - Demography</b> . <br>  This is how reports on the age and sex of the site visitors will look like: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/cbf/c62/f59/cbfc62f59326470c8e304c72daebd168.jpg"><br><br>  According to the schedule we can see that the most active are men 25-34 years old.  In order to <b>highlight the key audience segment in the report</b> , you should save it in the system.  Select: <b>Audience - Overview - All sessions - + Segment.</b>  And then fill in the data we need. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/9d4/f69/8c7/9d4f698c7d1b42cfbca7fdb03e946657.jpg"><br><br>  By saving this segment, you can track the core audience data in any further Google Analytics report. <br><br>  <b><u>2. Optimize sales funnel</u></b> <br><br>  Any entrepreneur dreams that the user saw the advertisement, clicked on the link and immediately registered on the site.  Unfortunately, in reality, the sales funnel looks different.  In order for a network user to register on the site, he must see the advertisement from different channels of communication 3-4 times, consider the need, and only then register. <br>  The current order of things <b>about the main ways to attract customers can also be found in the Google Analytics report: Conversions - Multichannel Sequences - Main Conversion Paths.</b> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/d56/3b6/b92/d563b6b92e784fb7a11ac2007645c9f8.jpg"><br><br>  If you get 100 registrations for one of the sales routes, and only one of these 100 clients brings real money to the business (500 rubles, for example), then the conversion from such a channel is equal to = 5 rubles.  Having determined the conversion of each of the promotion channels, you can choose options for improvements. <br><br>  <b><u>3. Behavioral reports for understanding user insight.</u></b> <br><br>  To understand <b>how visitors behave on the site</b> , open the <b>Behavior - Behavior Map</b> report: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/400/617/6d6/4006176d6a6c44489cbb9f567ffdaca5.jpg"><br><br>  What can you learn from the report on user behavior on the site?  The most important thing is a detailed visualization of the answer to the question whether your site really pushes users to perform the actions that you want from them.  You can track the moments where you lose traffic - on the registration form, on confirmation or other points and improve them in order to use the maximum traffic opportunity. <br>  Analyze your audience, its interests and determine the main communication channels, types of content provided and suggestions for the emergence of insight.  I wish you success! </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/299148/">https://habr.com/ru/post/299148/</a></p>
