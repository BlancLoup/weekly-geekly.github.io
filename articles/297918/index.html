The company received 90 million dollars (62 million pounds sterling) of financing in the next round E. Now the cost of Anaplan is estimated at 1.1 billion dollars (760 million pounds sterling).  The company develops an online business planning and management platform that competes with products from such giants as Oracle, SAP and Microsoft. <br><br>  The Anaplan project was launched in 2006, with Michael Gould as its founder.  Currently, the company employs more than 500 employees.  The startup has grown, it has branches in other countries - only 12 offices around the world.  Despite the fact that the Anaplan headquarters was later moved to San Francisco, most of the development is carried out in the office in York, where about 80 employees work.  In the UK, the company has opened two more offices - in Maidenhead and London.

      Today, the company has invested a total of 240 million dollars (166 million pounds).  Gould himself says that with the latest round of funding, Anaplan will be able to increase the staff to 1,200 over the next year.  The company needs mainly engineers and sales force employees.  According to him, to obtain funding was not a difficult task for Anaplan, negotiations with investors lasted for the past two months.  One of the reasons for attracting third-party capital, as Michael said, is that the company is not profitable at this stage, but its management has a clear understanding of the goals and how to make a startup profitable in the near future. <br><br>  According to the research that was published last June by GP Bullhound research firm, at that time in the north of England there was only one technology startup valued at one billion dollars - AO.com.  However, despite the success of the business, this unicorn does nothing revolutionary - the company sells home appliances over the Internet. <br><br>  ‚ÄúWe are going to become an open joint-stock company.  However, when this happens depends on many factors.  At the moment, the market does not have this, "- says the company's founder, Michael Gould. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/297918/">https://habr.com/ru/post/297918/</a></p>
