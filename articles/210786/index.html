For GNOME Shell, many have a very close attitude, caused by very strange innovations in the interface area, which is why they even call it the ‚Äúpostdesktop desktop environment‚Äù, and, unfortunately, the traditional ‚Äúdampness‚Äù, with lots of bugs and oddities in completely unexpected places . <br><br>  Here the third GNOME was patched in critical places, supplemented with extensions, including several specially written, decorated with its own theme.  This is done to please the lovers of the minimalist interface of the third gnome, to make life easier for those who are used to Win / Mac / KDE /, and in general, to make work safer and more convenient. <br><br>  In fact, you can even download as many as three GNOME modes in the distribution: <ul><li>  Modern GNOME-shell with improvements and additional extensions - ‚Äúdash-launch / switch‚Äù has always been accessible from the left panel, notifications from instant messengers, including Skype, go to the always visible top panel, returned shortcuts on the desktop, etc. </li><li>  "Classic" mode, reminiscent of the "good old GNOME2", with the menu and the bottom panel. </li><li>  A specially designed simplified mode ‚ÄúGNOME Fallback‚Äù, designed for weak computers and netbooks, without the graphic acceleration required by the mainstream gnome <a rel="nofollow" href="http://wiki.rosalab.ru/ru/index.php/%25D0%2591%25D0%25BB%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B3:%25D0%25A2%25D0%25BE%25D1%2587%25D0%25BA%25D0%25B0_%25D0%25A0%25D0%25BE%25D1%2581%25D1%258B/GNOME_%25D0%25B4%25D0%25BB%25D1%258F_%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B5%25D1%2582%25D0%25B1%25D1%2583%25D0%25BA%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B2_%25E2%2580%2594_%25D1%2580%25D0%25B5%25D0%25B6%25D0%25B8%25D0%25BC_%25D0%25B1%25D0%25B5%25D0%25B7_%25D1%2582%25D0%25BE%25D1%2580%25D0%25BC%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B7%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B2">[1]</a> . </li></ul>  As for the rosa-elementary design theme, there, besides a lot of professionally drawn icons, the design has rational ergonomic goals: for example, in this GNOME theme, KDE applications are not alien, and the appearance of windows is more familiar to Windows users.  Yes, the classic block of buttons with minimization and the red close button: ‚Äú <a rel="nofollow" href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/182510/"><i>... while explaining to her where that, I understood very much why in the Dew design there was a big red button to close the window!</i></a>  <a rel="nofollow" href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/182510/"><i>...</i></a> "  But of course, it is easy to install any theme you like from hundreds of popular <a rel="nofollow" href="http://gnome-look.org/index.php%3Fxsortmode%3Dhigh%26amp%3Bpage%3D0%26amp%3Bxcontentmode%3D191">[2]</a> , and the wallpaper (only beautiful but specially ‚Äúboring‚Äù wallpapers are included) can be changed directly from the browser. <br><br>  The distribution kit is full-fledged - not some kind of an add-on on someone else's package base - packages are baked in <a rel="nofollow" href="http://abf.io/">ABF's</a> own build system, it is constantly checked by automatic and manual testing, and according to its results, as well as user comments, a lot of improvements are made that improve ergonomics and reliability. <br><br>  What did his team work on in this distribution?

time, but to save time, I summarize - in general, these are not separate ‚Äúunique products inside the distribution kit‚Äù, but many seemingly unnoticeable improvements, after which the system starts working ‚Äúas it should‚Äù and ‚Äúas expected‚Äù. <br><br>  Distribution suitable for entertainment and for work.  Out of the box, everything that a ‚Äúhome user‚Äù might need is a browser + flash, players with codecs, an office, etc. <br><br>  There are more than 20 thousand packages in the repositories (Main ‚âà 12 thousand, ontrib ‚âà 12 thousand, + Nonfree + Restricted + ...), but it's probably easier to say that there are all known open-source programs / technology stacks (LibreOffice, TeX, LAMP / C ++ / ... ), and the standard installation of the repositories can put the usual closed-source, such as Skype / Steam / Dropbox. <br><br>  And finally, the promised screenshot from my laptop: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/23d/cc5/f34/23dcc5f3453e6cdc86f9df5ebc71d64f.png"><br><br>  I invite you to try, probably in the first place, GNOME lovers, well, or those who appreciate the minimalism of the interface, however, according to our experiments, is quite suitable for home users, including very domestic ones.  Unless it is desirable to explain that "in any incomprehensible situation, press the WIN button."  I myself am a Windows switcher, but I feel comfortable because of the compatibility of hotkeys (I always placed the panel in Win on the left). <br><br>  <a rel="nofollow" href="http://mirror.rosalab.ru/rosa/rosa2012.1/iso/ROSA.Fresh.R2.GNOME/">Download</a> , <a rel="nofollow" href="http://wiki.rosalab.ru/ru/index.php/%25D0%25A3%25D1%2581%25D1%2582%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BD%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B2%25D0%25BA%25D0%25B0_ROSA_Desktop">burn to disk or flash drive</a> and try - you can first live mode, then you can put it. <br><br>  Comments and suggestions are welcomed! </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/210786/">https://habr.com/ru/post/210786/</a></p>
