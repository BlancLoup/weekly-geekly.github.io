Soon he will allow to see who is still on this page on every website and every page, see the profile of a nearby user on social networks where the user is registered (if he hasn‚Äôt hidden himself on the site) and chat with him without leaving the site that users view. <br>  In the post in more detail - why, for whom and how ... <br><br><a name="habracut"></a>

      <b>Where did the idea come from?</b> <br>  Communication between users on most sites is limited to forums, blogs (which everyone does not visit), commenting and evaluation of content.  Users who visit the same sites have the same interests, but they cannot establish a convenient form of contact outside of social networks. <br>  Suppose you are developing an application for Facebook, spend a lot of time on websites dedicated to developing applications for Facebook.  Can't find answers to your questions.  Write to the forum ... and wait for someone to answer you someday.  Go further in the search for the information you need. <br>  It would be great to see who else is now on the same site and page.  In our example, these will be developers who solve similar problems.  It would be great to look at some minimal information for other users - age, interests, what they did, etc.  And it is easy to talk with them, consult on their issues.  And as a result - to become virtual friends and contact each other for help and advice. <br><br>  <b>What have we done?</b> <br>  Immediately, an important caveat is not a social network, not a general mathematical or niche one.  This is not a duplication of social networking features.  This is not a service that is built on the formation of a list of friends (the next one !!!). <br>  We made a social web service that allows its users to do 2 things: <br>  1) View who else on the page and site now, view information about the user, or rather his profile on social networks where the user is registered <br>  2) Chat with one or more users without leaving the site and page being viewed <br>  This is a toolbar.  Interfaces, please do not judge strictly, they are still in active work.  Now the toolbar looks like this: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/c24/d40/4e7/c24d404e77b1b2fce6fd136585afcd4b.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Friends - when opening, a list of your friends from social networks is displayed, you can see which of them is now on the Internet and on which sites (if the user has not hidden this information), the opportunity to chat with friends from the sidebar in the browser <br>  Online - when opened, a list of users viewing the same site and page as you is displayed.  You can see in which social networks users are registered, you can go and see their profiles.  You can send a message and chat with the user (similar to IM), or create a discussion and chat with several users at once. <br>  Messages - a list of your posts and open discussions with the latest posts <br>  Facebook, Twitter - notification widgets about major events in social networks. <br>  This is what the Friends sidebar will look like: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/563/cdb/ab0/563cdbab02d9ac0cf7157c41a98da6de.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  <b>The main features.</b> <br>  1) Lack of own registration.  Users register with their accounts from other social networks, and we do not store their passwords.  At the start, integration with Facebook and Twitter is implemented, but the list will expand. <br>  2) A convenient and easy opportunity to invite your friends from other social networks to the project and create a social circle for close friends with whom you most often communicate on the basis of your friends from social networks <br>  3) The ability to see in the browser who is now on the same site and page <br>  4) The ability to see which of your friends in other social networks are now online and on which sites they are located (if they have not hidden themselves) <br>  5) IM mechanism in the browser, the ability to communicate with other site visitors and their friends from other social networks that are online, without leaving the site being viewed <br>  6) Flexible visibility settings, the ability to make yourself invisible on the Internet everywhere or on individual sites, restrict others' access to information about the viewed site and communicate with unfamiliar users. <br>  How is this done? <br>  Language - Python, Django website, API server - Twisted.  Each application is located in a cluster, nginx performs balancing.  DB - MySQL Master / Slave, In-Memory DB - Custom In-Memory DB based on Twisted server. <br><br>  <b>What is and what will be?</b> <br>  At the start, we plan to integrate with Facebook and Twitter.  In the future we plan to integrate with other networks that provide an open API - MySpace, Google account (including Blogspot), business social networks (primarily LinkedIn), LJ, VKontakte.  Carefully look at Google Wave, there are thoughts how to integrate with them. <br>  At the start, the toolbar is made only for Firefox.  In the near future we will make a version for IE. <br>  If the start is successful, there are thoughts about the development of the project towards the development of a plug-in that is embedded in the sites by the owners. <br><br>  <b>And who are the competitors?</b> <br>  We carefully look at the development of several groups of services that can offer rather quickly similar opportunities: <br>  1) IM and social media aggregators - Yoono, DigsBy, Meebo <br>  2) Chats - first of all TinyChat <br>  3) Facebook Connect, Google Friend Connect <br>  4) Conduit <br>  5) Google Wave and the first development of third-party developers on this platform <br>  6) Ya.Online, Yandeks.Bar, Google.Toolbar, as well as Google's SideWiki. <br>  7) And a few others <br>  Not yet offered. <br><br>  <b>Who and why?</b> <br>  1) Meet new friends and talk on professional topics on thematic professional sites <br>  2) Communication between users when shopping in online stores <br>  3) Search for new virtual friends by interests wherever the user goes to the Internet <br>  4) Meet beautiful girls wherever a male user goes to the Internet ÔÅä <br>  five) ‚Ä¶ <br>  We hope to continue the list with the help of the Habra community.  ÔÅä <br>  The service is designed for active users of social networks, for those who have virtual friends for a long time and many times more than real ones, who actively communicate with people whom he has never seen and whom he has the same interests, who actively comment on and discuss interesting to him ( her) content, who is open to new communication and dating. <br><br>  The development of beta is currently being completed, the project is in the process of closed testing.  All who wish to take part in the closed testing - welcome.  We will be able to give no more than 100 invites so far, everyone who receives an invite from us will be able to invite 10 of his friends from Facebook or followers from Twitter.  Those <a href="http://keenko.com/">interested</a> - leave a request on the site <a href="http://keenko.com/">keenko.com</a> . <br>  With your help, we want to make the service really useful and interesting for the user. <br>  Please write down your opinion in the comments, what would you as users like to see in the service, which of the competitors we missed. <br>  Thank you in advance for your comments and participation in the closed beta. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/79050/">https://habr.com/ru/post/79050/</a></p>
