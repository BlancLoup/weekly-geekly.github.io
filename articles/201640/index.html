  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Sony Xperia Z1: work on the bugs at the request of workers</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"> We met Sony Xperia Z1 smartphone in September at the IFA exhibition.  After listening to the incendiary presentation of Kazuo Hirai, I somehow immediately decided that my next Android device would be Z1.  At that time, Xperia Z had already been in my pocket for several months, causing only positive feelings, and his heir seemed a natural and desirable replacement.  Moreover, Sony has improved everything in it, really worthy of improvement. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/818/d9a/f02/818d9af023cf69407bee9152e82f7a51.jpg"><br><br>  The smartphone quickly got into my hands, I began to use it regularly, and the farther I went, the shorter the text of the article about the Z1, emerging in my head.  Not because the device is bad.  On the contrary - it is excellent.  But this is not a fundamentally new model, but a good work on the bugs.  Accordingly, to what has already been said about <a href="http://www.dgl.ru/news/videoobzor-smartfona-sony-xperia-z-ot-goblina_3333.html">Xperia Z, it</a> remains to add only a few important touches.  And, of course, look inside the device for interesting design features. <a name="habracut"></a>

      Z1 turned out to be even larger than quite rather big Z, and both in length and in width.  Given the fact that the screen diagonal remains the same, this can only be explained by the desire to fit a 3000 mAh battery inside.  The desire, to be sure, is commendable.  However, the extended side frames make it very difficult to control with one hand.  So, being a user of the official Twitter application, I can‚Äôt reach out with my thumb to the tweet button (upper right corner) with the left grip.  Well, that is, of course, I can, but for this you have to intercept the smartphone in a different way.  Nowadays, these little things do not scare anyone, but, for example, the LG G2 with its 5.2-inch screen is very thin frames allow you to reach the same angle without problems. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/ee9/2da/5d7/ee92da5d7b72d2f8f93b9b39669b1f8d.jpg"><br><br>  A very important advantage for me is the dust and moisture resistance of Sony's flagship smartphones.  Whether it rains, snows on the street - you always get Xperia without fear of damaging the delicate stuffing.  True, before this was achieved with the help of plugs for any and all openings on the smartphone.  In the Z1, the headphone jack has finally been freed from it, which will please fans to use the smartphone as a player.  I myself constantly listened to music on the Xperia Z, forgiving him not the best expressiveness of sound and not perfect high for the great application Walkman.  It is really very convenient and thoughtful, and on other smartphones I really miss it.  On Z1, the situation is about the same: the application is excellent, but the sound ... The sound is at a good average level.  Better than the absolute majority of devices on Android, but worse than on the iPhone and, especially, <a href="http://www.dgl.ru/reviews/lg-g2-snaruji-i-vnutri-novogo-koreyskogo-flagmana_4213.html">LG G2 with its DAC Wolfson WM5110</a> .  So if you do not bother about the sound of plates and copper-nickel harmonics, listen and enjoy the Walkman.  If the headphones are cheaper than thousands of dollars, consider useless junk, buy something else.  However, you, dear audiophiles, will do it without my advice. <br><br>  As it was known to absolutely everyone, even those who never held the Xperia Z in their hands, this device had a Terribly Bad Screen.  I was amused by this secret knowledge, because I looked at this screen every day and I liked everything about it.  Yes, I would probably choose a different matrix for processing photos in Photoshop, but as far as I know, a full-fledged version of this program has not reached Android yet.  For everything else, the Xperia Z screen fits perfectly, and the limited viewing angles made you feel quite comfortable even in a crowded subway car, when everyone, out of boredom, starts to pry into the neighbor's phone screen. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/6bb/7a1/090/6bb7a1090937f03bb3fe097544a4b598.jpg"><br>  <i>As we can see from the portrait of writer Alex Exler, the shades fade at an angle, but are not distorted.</i>  <i>Personally, I think this is more of an advantage than a disadvantage of a matrix.</i> <br><br>  But these lovers of privacy, apparently, not very much, so Sony Xperia Z1 put the screen a little better.  He still can not compete in brightness, rich colors and viewing angles with the best products of Samsung and LG, but compared with the Xperia Z progress is evident.  Shades have become more succulent, viewing angles slightly increased.  Fortunately, not so much so that the neighbors in the car are too happy with the content of your Facebook feed.  In my opinion, the Z1 screen is optimal for a mobile device.  Everything is as it should, and the eyes do not get tired.  But then decide for yourself which approach is closer to you.  The main thing is to trust yourself, and not to fool quotes from reviews of some unknown individuals. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/75f/7fc/34f/75f7fc34f48cd5110ea3372df07f79b0.jpg"><br><br>  On the camera Xperia Z1, I will do a separate material, because so far I have not managed to make an unequivocal impression about it.  On the one hand, Sony is almost the main supplier of photo modules on the market, and the freshest 20-megapixel Exmor RS simply cannot be bad.  On the other hand, it seems that the camera software has not yet been perfected, and in some cases even in manual mode, the pictures are clearly worse than they could.  Therefore, I repeat, I take a short timeout to study exactly the photographic part of the Xperia Z1, but for now let's climb inside this big smartphone. <br><br>  As is now the case with Sony, the Z1 case is made of glue, therefore, without a special soldering station, it is strongly not recommended to open it.  Even if by some miracle it is possible to remove the back cover, it is simply impossible to attach it back without this station itself and a special expensive adhesive tape.  Master Alexander Levchenko has a station, so we got inside without incident. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/8f8/f92/639/8f8f926399d69c9291c068294a57eafa.jpg"><br><br>  Immediately catches the eye is a hefty battery, because of which, it seems, and had to increase the dimensions.  He, fortunately, is not glued to the body tightly, and therefore relatively easy to replace (if you do not take into account, of course, the complexity of the initial opening).  Was it worth stuffing such a colossus?  Of course, it was worth it.  Z1 is now guaranteed to live till late evening, even if you were always looking at the screen and starting applications from early morning (I‚Äôll stress that this is without activating the Stamina mode, which can add another three to four hours).  The result in these times is not bad, but not a record one.  LG G2 from the battery of the same capacity can safely work until noon of the next day, and in the evening Z1 should definitely be put on charge.  The battery, by the way, in the Z1 is about the same as in the <a href="http://www.dgl.ru/reviews/sony-xperia-z-ultra-lichnye-vpechatleniya-i-vskrytie-odnogo-iz-samyh-bolshih-smartshetov_4168.html">Z Ultra</a> , even the name of the model differs by just one dial at the end.  The characteristics are completely identical. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/121/d58/1b3/121d581b30a61b020556617b7de7d036.jpg"><br><br>  The layout of the components is standard for modern Sony smartphones, regardless of size.  The rectangular board is located in the upper part, and all sorts of antennas are huddled next to it.  Some readers had complaints about the reliability of the Wi-Fi connection, and I can't disagree with them.  Indeed, the ‚Äútenacity‚Äù of the Z1 is not perfect, and sometimes it barely holds the access point where it‚Äôs going to feel very confident.  Not to say that the sensitivity is very bad, but it can be better.  Fortunately, this is Wi-Fi, because the radio module responsible for mobile communication is very good and does not suffer from incontinence.  There are no problems with the support of 4G connection, the benefit in this is Sony in our market is almost a pioneer. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/3d8/e8c/aa6/3d8e8caa6732561773d9aea00c59ab8a.jpg"><br><br>  From the back of the motherboard looks quite normal.  True, I haven‚Äôt seen smartphones with 16-gigabyte Toshiba flash memory in smartphones for quite a while, but there‚Äôs nothing surprising about it.  But on the other hand ... Oh wow! <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/9f6/169/953/9f61699539d3f38ae44206dabff92015.jpg"><br><br>  I have not seen such a mighty layer of thermal paste for a long time even in laptops.  Of course, Snapdragon 800 (Qualcomm MSM 8974) at a frequency of 2150 MHz is heated very significantly, but I have not seen thermal paste in other products.  It looks not very aesthetically pleasing, but, on the other hand, people rarely look inside smartphones.  And efficient heat removal is a pledge of device durability and the absence of strange slowdowns under load.  Yes, modern mobile processors are also able to sharply reset the frequency due to overheating. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/628/7d7/b1b/6287d7b1b3b6778ec8a1e58a3f0fcc12.png"><br><br>  By the way, most of the time the Xperia Z1 processor runs at 300 MHz, sometimes overclocking to 652 MHz.  Well, and very rarely, mainly in games, the frequency rises to the maximum.  Whatever the complexity of the task, the smartphone is always very fast, and there are no complaints about performance at all.  By the way, it also heats up very moderately, and, unlike the fellows, the smartphone is devoid of ‚Äúhot spots‚Äù.  It's just that the entire upper part becomes evenly warm ‚Äî that's all. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/8ca/0b2/4b5/8ca0b24b5063c32965765b49cb22462e.jpg"><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/723/d51/b07/723d51b07f68e5234a6c259f8ceb0012.jpg"><br><br>  The main camera module looks quite common.  And you can't say that there are so many megapixels in it. <br><br>  By the way, pay attention to the fastening of the front camera. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/d8b/be9/e7d/d8bbe9e7de26e7d6e01def726b14b63e.jpg"><br><br>  From the point of view of construction, it is quite ... dangerous.  This is bad when the train was initially put on a kink.  I hope that Sony provided for this moment, but the fatigue fracture is an unpleasant thing.  To be honest, there was a feeling that in Z1, to save money, they used a module from another device, because in other Sony models (and not only Sony) I did not see this. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/687/7b6/00b/6877b600b9213a5609610d2fece0a8da.jpg"><br><br>  And this is what the case looks like without a battery and a motherboard.  Sony just adores using fancy cables, and the Z1 is no exception.  Where business colleagues are limited to a thin wire, Sony is building an impressive structure.  Which, however, looks very reliable and is unlikely to ever be spoiled.  And this is good, because the train itself is usually inexpensive, but replacing it, associated with the bulkhead of the entire apparatus, flies into a pretty penny. <br><br>  I will not write about the software this time, because it is exactly the same as in Xperia Z or Xperia Z Ultra.  Personally, I really like it.  I have not seen anything better on this platform yet.  Android is very fortunate that Sony has been <s>finishing up on its finishing</s> , and other smartphone makers have <s>some ideas to</s> draw inspiration from.  Because you can not all be inspired by one iPhone. <br><br>  By the way, the built-in backup utility has finally learned how to transfer data between different models of smartphones.  I remember that with Xperia V on Xperia Z I could not move with all the belongings.  And with Xperia Z on Xperia Z1 - please. <br><br>  <b><i>Total</i></b> <br><br>  Sony Xperia Z has become a great smartphone.  Perhaps not within the market as a whole, but undoubtedly for Sony itself.  He seemed to delineate the boundary between the timelessness, in which two years the Sony Ericsson joint venture was raging, and a new, really cool period in the history of the mobile division of the Japanese corporation. <br><br>  Xperia Z1 - quality work on the bugs.  Yes, probably, it was worth trying to keep the same dimensions, despite the increase in battery capacity, but, as I understood after studying the insides, this was possible only with the refusal of moisture resistance.  And this is an important distinctive feature, without it in any way. <br><br>  As a result, we have the largest 5-inch smartphone on the market.  Good this, or not, will show sales.  But I can already predict what the next Sony flagship will be. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/464/a9e/7e5/464a9e7e5f8f863f2d08c982bb63e52b.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/85f/6f7/968/85f6f79686f10ad2bf7e3653d526082f.jpg"><br>  <i>From bottom to top: Sony Xperia Z1, Sony Xperia Z, LG G2.</i>  <i>Samsung Galaxy S4, iPhone 5s</i> <br><br>  It will return to Z dimensions, retaining (or even slightly increasing) battery life.  Camera resolution will remain the same, but optical stabilization will appear.  The screen resolution will increase if not to the level of Ultra HD, it is still very noticeable.  And I would really like to see a decent DAC appear in the heir to the Z1.  Indeed, such an intelligent software just needs the appropriate hardware. <br><br>  According to a moderately good tradition, Sony's flagship smartphone in official retail costs 29,990 rubles, while the Xperia Z has already fallen in price to 21,990 rubles.  According to tradition, deft guys, carrying phones in suitcases, offer very good savings.  They Z1 is from 22 000 rubles.  However, as experience suggests, ‚Äúa guarantee from a service center‚Äù may turn out to be, if not a fiction, then a source of serious troubles.  But, I want to believe that you will not need it when choosing any of the purchase options. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/021/c55/c96/021c55c9650fa57b4d4b5af34f26321b.jpg"><br>  <i>So repair in some service centers</i> <br><br>  Sony continues to make very ... intelligible smart phones with a tangible touch of personality.  Not just a combination of characteristics, but solid and thoughtful devices. <br><br>  Only mind you do not stop.  Without the current Sony drive on the Android platform it will be boring. <br><br>  PS The author thanks Alexander Levchenko ( <a href="http://www.tech-town.ru/">www.tech-town.ru</a> ) for assistance in disassembling and assembling the smartphone Sony Xperia Z1 </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/201640/">https://habr.com/ru/post/201640/</a></p>
