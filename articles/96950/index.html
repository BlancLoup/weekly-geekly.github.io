I know that on this topic there has recently been a steady ever-increasing interest, I decided not to keep in myself what might be interesting and useful to others.  Immediately, I note that I treat those who believe that interest in Chinese phones is growing deservedly. <a name="habracut"></a>  And because some of my conclusions may be slightly biased. <br><br>  There are a lot of electronics manufacturers of various complexity in China (how does this country differ from, for example, Ukraine or even Russia).  Therefore, it is not surprising that in China there are many popular brands of Chinese manufacturers, and they successfully compete with foreign ones.  Again, this is strikingly different from the situation with countries like Ukraine and Russia - we only recognize all foreign, and manufacturers by hook or by crook tend to give out their products for non-China goods, while Consumers are happy to be deceived and believe it.  At this time they are busy with important business: they protect each of their beloved with foaming at the mouth, but from this no less a foreign brand and actively stamp their feet on any sodding of Ukrainian production. <br><br>  One way or another, and completely irrespective of what is happening here, in China there are a huge number of local brands.  Although I do not know how fair it is to consider the brands of a country with a population of 1.34 billion people local.  And the general population of the planet has never heard such names as <b>Changhong, TCL, Hasee</b> .  I decided to gradually try to correct this situation and gradually talk about what is interesting in such a distant country.

      Communication with the engineers of one of the largest developers for the production of mobile phones finally helped to decompose my knowledge on the shelves and I came to the conclusion that all of the manufacturers of mobile phones from China can be divided into 4 groups: <br>  1. Brands that orient their activities to domestic consumption.  Most of them grew out of state-owned enterprises, founded in the 50-80s and therefore have an impressive history, which they are proud of.  Products have a high level of quality (not lower than that of global manufacturers), development departments have impressive budgets.  Originality is also to be found here.  Products (unfortunately) are mostly unknown outside the country - manufacturers simply have enough for a comfortable existence of the domestic market.  Although recently, due to favorable circumstances, these manufacturers have been slowly exploring access to other countries.  Examples: <b>TCL</b> is the first popular handset maker in China, <b>Alcatel</b> brand holder;  <b>Changhong</b> is the second most popular handset maker in China (which is interesting today when I read the X10 copy review ( <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/hardware/96932/">habrahabr.ru/blogs/hardware/96932</a> ) on the box you can see ChAng _HAng - that is, it‚Äôs a parody of a small company to the Chinese Changhong brand), <b>Hasee, Hisense</b> . <br><img src="http://www.ahong.com/en/images/logo.jpg" alt="Changhong" title="Changhong"><br><br>  2. Manufacturers established as joint ventures with foreign firms or with the participation of foreign capital.  Rarely have a history of more than 15-20 years, although sometimes they are based on long-standing enterprises.  The quality level is also high.  In the products viewed mainly European design line on the oriental scale.  Such enterprises mainly focus on the markets of other countries, paying less attention to China.  The brightest representative is <b>Huawei</b> .  The manufacturer has an excellent reputation both in the world and in its native country, but in China there is little.  Unlike the previous group, products are widely distributed in the world, but in most cases - under foreign brands.  Representatives of the second group have already achieved what the first does not have - penetration into other countries, and now they have ambitions to start working under their own brand. <br><img src="http://www.huawei.com/enus/gc/66_img/logo212.gif" alt="Huawei" title="Huawei"><br><br>  3. The third group is very interesting.  These trademarks (they still do not reach the brand, and they also cannot always be called producers) were created mainly in the last 5 years, mainly with the participation of external capital.  Clearly focused on the external market.  It was the phones of this and the following groups that formed the image of the average Chinese <b>Nokla</b> , and it is on them that the whole burden of humanity‚Äôs contemptuous attitude towards Chinese phones lies.  Often these ‚Äúmanufacturers‚Äù do not have not only their own production (this is not a fatal flaw in the modern world), but also their own development department (even software).  The range in this case is a hodgepodge from different factories that put the customer's trademark.  Since the beginning of the 21st century, OEM / ODM cooperation has become popular all over the world (including the CIS countries).  With such a business, a local company ordered a batch of standard manufacturer's devices to a Chinese factory, but with its own brand.  And already for the money involved in the promotion of the brand, service and so on.  But I also kept all my earnings.  Echoes of those times are observed now: <b>Assistant, Ergo, IXTONE, Rover</b> .  Let's go back to China.  In fact, the brands of this group are an example of such cooperation, only manufacturers and TM holders are now in the same country.  Moreover, the characteristic features of filling product lines in this way are preserved: it happens that the same machine is present in the catalogs of different brands.  Products under such TM can be found on the radio markets of most countries of the world (and often out of service), but very few people know about them in their native country.  I will give an example.  Native Chinese factory <b>feedback</b> on <b>Anycool was</b> not positive.  According to him, these phones in China are not only quoted absolutely, but are also sold semi-legally because  made without compliance and simply will not pass the certification.  Attempt to learn about more decent, in my opinion, <b>Fly-ing</b> was not crowned with success at all - the person does not know this. <br><img src="http://www.anycool.it/immagini/anycool_logo.png" alt="Anycool" title="Anycool"><br>  4. The fourth group includes manufacturers that have not reached the level of group 3. As well as many other small manufacturers, legal and semi-legal, separate conveyors of large official manufacturers, and so on.  These products can exist without a brand at all, with a label like <b>‚ÄúBluetooot MP4 ENJOY MEDIA‚Äù</b> or again the same <b>Nokla, SannyErikssan</b> and so on.  Often served by orders of brands such as Anycool, many are slowly developing and growing, and are also sold, merged, enlarged, ruined, quietly disappear.  Here there is an interesting way to sell devices - not by the piece, but by weight.  That is, the buyer ships, for example, 100 kilograms of phones - there is no need to talk about quality, but cheap.  Naturally, then the plant does not assume any responsibility.  And phones go to the CIS under the guise of "inexpensive and high-quality" and do their dirty work.  It is characteristic that Chinese manufacturers of phones of this level do not value customers - 10 new ones are waiting in line to replace the offended, and you should not worry about reputation. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/5c3/7ed/727/5c37ed7274c2c7512a8c15e2afa34a61.jpg" alt="ChinaIphone" title="ChinaIphone"><br>  Thank you for your attention, I will soon try to gradually show examples of products from different manufacturers! </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/96950/">https://habr.com/ru/post/96950/</a></p>
