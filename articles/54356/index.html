  <section class="page js-page"><h1>rumors with pictures: Wacom Intuos 4</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  In 1989, Wacom was the first to introduce to the public a tablet with a wireless one that does not require a battery and responds to a pen with a pen.  Since then, their products enjoy a well-deserved popularity both among amateurs and professionals: not a single competitor even came close with their digitizers to the level of ergonomics and functionality of Wacom tablets. <br>  In 2005, the second update of the Intuos professional tablet line was introduced, in which programmable buttons appeared, improved specifications, a pen was updated, weight was reduced and new leads and 16: 9 form factor models were introduced. <br>  A few days ago, the network leaked information from several photos regarding the new update - Intuos 4, which I learned from a careful friend. <br><img src="http://sparklehorse.ru/ph/shit/000ap35s--20090313-114813.jpg" alt="Box"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Information from the site ImagineFX was quite quickly removed (the branch <a href="http://209.85.129.132/search%3Fq%3Dcache:LyH1cEF_bj0J:community.imaginefx.com/forums/thread/181469.aspx%2Bintuos%2B4%26hl%3Den%26ct%3Dclnk%26cd%3D14%26client%3Dopera">remained only in the cache</a> ), exactly like the discussion thread on conceptart.org, on which one of the insiders shared information about what they promised us. <br><br>  And they promise us: <br>  - even more improved those characteristics <br>  - new feather <br>  - location ExpressKeys vertically and in 2 rows <br>  - Replacing TouchStrip with a new TouchRing (configured for scrolling, zooming, brush size, canvas rotation, layer selection) <br>  - switch between multiple TouchRing features <br>  - 16: 9 format <br>  - another surface of the film <br>  - new software menu <br><br><img src="http://sparklehorse.ru/ph/shit/000akq99-1-20090313-114843.jpg">

      Now I would like to write a little by myself. <br>  Those characteristics and 16: 9 - everything is clear here - these are improvements dictated by time.  However, it is interesting what will happen to the most popular format among pros - A4.  It makes no special sense to make it wider horizontally, since the tablet is already not small and having increased the size it will turn into almost A3 on the table, which is not very convenient.  At the same time, the A5 is wide in size almost as A4.  It is possible that A5 and A4 will be rejected altogether by introducing some kind of new intermediate size, smaller than A4 wide, but larger than A5 wide. <br>  The pen looks almost like before.  I wonder if everything will be rubberized, will there be interchangeable rubber parts?  Although in my opinion the coolest feather was at Intuos 2 <br>  ExpressKey and TouchStrip do not know how anyone, but I always switch off, since there are few buttons on everything you need - the right block is not convenient to use, TouchStrip is funny at all (you sit yourself working, you didn‚Äôt move it this way and here the TYDESHYS zoom becomes 2.5% ) - in general, from the keyboard, doing the same thing is much more convenient.  6 buttons - this is more interesting and the vertical position in my opinion is much more convenient than the block on the 3rd.  However, what really interested me was TouchRing, or rather its interaction with other programs.  I use PS in my work and, very rarely, Painter, they both support the rotation of the canvas, and if TouchRing works correctly as stated with the brush size and the canvas rotation, it will be great (now the size of the brush is 10-15 in hotkey not hot very convenient, as, in theory, turning the ring) <br>  About the surface.  On the A4 SE and the bamboo, the surface was a little different from the old one, too smooth and skolzskim: it was a little more ... uh ... nice :).  Here, judging by the comments seen, the surface is incredibly pleasant to the touch and interacts with the pen much more resembling a pencil on paper than plastic on plastic. <br>  and Software Menu.  What it is - is still unknown, but on the conceptarte I missed the following phrase: <br>  <i>Integrated software menus: You'll never use the words 'Key' and 'Board' together again.</i>  <i>In fact, right now I'm typing on a piece of technology</i> <br>  This is probably a replacement for the already outdated PopUp Menu with an improved interface and functionality.  Is it possible to have an analogue on-screen keyboard? <br>  What he looks sexy think and say no. <br>  And I hope they finally throw out the mouse :) <br><br>  That seems to be all.  When exactly it will appear is still unknown, but apparently relatively soon.  Whether it is still unknown to change your third and second intuses for it (for me, the surface and TouchRing functionality will probably be a decisive factor), but still it's nice to see that the new line carries something new and work on the errors of the previous version. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/54356/">https://habr.com/ru/post/54356/</a></p>
