  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Who to entrust your business? Part 3 - Assistant Businessman</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Using the tips from previous articles, we found a <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/knopka/blog/220323/">good lawyer</a> and a <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/knopka/blog/218651/">reliable accountant</a> for our conditional company.  The business got to its feet, in some places it began to grow, new clients come, things are uphill, we return home late and irregularly, on the weekends we have fun doing the tasks that were not completed during the working week.  1024 cups of espresso and a couple of sleepless nights later, voices in your head begin to whisper the magic word "delegation."  Having overcome difficult moral contradictions, about which Maxim Ilyakhov <a href="http://bigplans.megaplan.ru/how-to-delegate">wrote well</a> , the entrepreneur begins to look for a person who will help him escape from the routine.  Such a person can be a secretary, personal assistant or <nobr>business assistant</nobr> . <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/da1/ad1/ee8/da1ad1ee84f7f30ef903531c70faa92c.png"><br><br>  The market offers a bunch of options, starting with <nobr>web services</nobr> and ending with full-time employees.  We did a little research and want to talk about popular options that suit Moscow entrepreneurs ranging from micro to medium business.  We will try to be objective and not to pull the blanket over the <a href="http://knopka.com/">button</a> , even though it is not easy. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h4>  <nobr>Online</nobr> Service <nobr>Exchange</nobr> </h4><br>  The Internet has given the temporarily unemployed, students, people with no experience and opponents of the office lifestyle a chance to become ‚Äúfreelance professionals of a wide profile‚Äù or simply to make some extra money in your free time.

      Thanks to services like <a href="http://work-zilla.com/">Workzilla</a> or <a href="https://youdo.com/">YouDo</a> , you can save yourself from the turnover as it arrives.  There is a feeling that there are no impossible tasks for civilian employees.  An entrepreneur can assign any task, starting with cleaning the office and going to the store, ending with lead calls and <nobr>web development</nobr> .  Workzilla focuses on tasks that the contractor can solve without leaving the room, while YouDo right on the main page offers a furniture assembler, an electrician, a courier and a nurse. <br><br>  Both services check professionals for professional suitability with the help of special tests.  Workzilla is pretty easy to cope with - just be careful and use logic.  The test from YouDo is more like a speedy psychological quiz of 94 questions, including ideological ones: ‚ÄúDo you like to frighten unfamiliar animals?‚Äù Or ‚ÄúDo you sabotage stupid decisions of your superiors?‚Äù.  The author of the post answered questions honestly and the test zafilil, but the correct answers are not difficult to guess. <br><br>  In addition to the entrance test and the collection of personal data, each performer earns a social rating.  In order to save it, you will have to fulfill orders qualitatively, deliberately lowering the cost of your services.  In case of serious failures, an irresponsible worker may be excommunicated from the heart of the <nobr>online stock exchange</nobr> , and in such cases money will be returned to the customer.  The exchanges charge a commission of 10‚Äì15% from the executor, but on both sides there is confidence that money or effort will not be wasted. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/abf/224/68d/abf22468da07a7fa4cf2662644ecee96.png"><br><br><h6>  To suit </h6>  Anyone who appreciates their time.  It is not necessary to be an entrepreneur to delegate <nobr>some</nobr> routine tasks (do we all remember the <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/165967/">story about a cunning engineer and an army of Chinese coders</a> ?).  This option will allow you to do your favorite thing, delegating boring one-time tasks to "specially trained people."  However, <nobr>you</nobr> <nobr>still have</nobr> to keep on hand a <nobr>list of</nobr> choices of a suitable performer, setting the task and evaluating the work.  You should not get carried away: if there is a constant stream of routine, it will be more profitable to hire an assistant or a virtual assistant. <br><br><h6>  How much is </h6>  500-5 000 rubles per task, from 200 rubles per hour of work. <br><br><h6>  Links </h6>  <a href="https://youdo.com/">YouDo</a> , <a href="http://work-zilla.com/">Workzilla</a> . <br><br><h4>  Virtual assistant </h4><br>  Stylish, fashionable, youth outsourcing has penetrated into all areas, the topic of this post is not an exception.  For relatively little money, you can get a virtual secretary or a whole <nobr>front office</nobr> that will work with correspondence, receive calls, search and structure the necessary information and carry out simple mechanical orders without occupying your office spaces (if any). <br><br>  Slightly more complex tasks will be able to take on the services of virtual assistants, such as <a href="http://www.yourbees.ru/">YourBees</a> or <a href="http://asst24.ru/">Assistant</a> .  These guys will book a hotel, order flowers for their beloved woman, arrange the event, help them find employees, suppliers, contractors and even real estate.  It was not possible to grope a clear border of competencies of the virtual assistant - he will undertake any legal tasks that do not require going beyond the office.  If you can not cope himself, help find a contractor. <br><br>  Another type of virtual assistant is <nobr>concierge services</nobr> .  In essence, this is a virtual assistant of the premium level, which will be 146% more courteous, polite and diligent.  Such services, as a rule, go to the appendage to elite brands like <a href="http://www.vertu.com/ru-ru/exclusive-services/vertu-concierge.aspx">Vertu</a> , <a href="https://www.visapremium.ru/">Visa cards</a> of Gold level and higher, or to membership in closed <nobr>luxury clubs</nobr> , so not everyone will be able to participate.  We have never faced face to face with similar phenomena, but they say that the quality is top notch.  Maybe you had this experience? <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/1dc/7af/a34/1dc7afa348896dd268f653cc2c6b5a0f.jpg"><br><br><h6>  To suit </h6>  Virtual secretaries and assistants will save you from daily struggle with routine, free up time for thinking about taking over the world.  The entrepreneur does not have to think about who will entrust this or that task.  Disadvantages: you will have to work with different employees (although there are assistants for the dedicated and elite levels) who will not dive into the specifics of the business.  But such an assistant will never get sick and will not give up everything for a trip to an exotic country. <br><br><h6>  How much is </h6><ul><li>  From 5,000 rubles per month for a virtual secretary; </li><li>  from 500 rubles per hour of virtual assistant work; </li><li>  Concierge service is priceless. </li></ul><br><h6>  Links </h6>  Virtual secretary / office: <a href="http://www.secretservice.ru/virtualnyj-sekretar/">secretservice.ru</a> , <a href="http://www.matrixoffice.ru/services/virtualnyy_sekretar/">matrixoffice.ru</a> , <a href="http://callcenter24.ru/office.shtml">callcenter24.ru</a> . <br><br>  Virtual assistants: <a href="http://www.yourbees.ru/">YourBees</a> , <a href="http://asst24.ru/">Assistant</a> , <a href="http://gf-company.ru/"><nobr>gf-company</nobr> .ru</a> . <br><br>  <nobr>Concierge services</nobr> : <a href="http://www.quintessentially.com/russian">quintessentially.com</a> , <a href="https://www.visapremium.ru/">Visa</a> , <a href="http://www.vertu.com/ru-ru/exclusive-services/vertu-concierge.aspx">Vertu</a> . <br><br><h4>  Remote secretary </h4><br>  It is incredibly difficult to select new epithets for the category that you describe for the third time.  The secretary is remotely endowed with the same pros and cons as a remote accountant or lawyer.  One of the advantages is a more personal approach than that of virtual assistants and a lower cost in comparison with a full-time employee.  The disadvantages are also obvious: not the highest motivation, the impossibility of physical impact.  Yes, and tea will not bring. <br><br>  On the other hand, the secretarial profession does not require the same level of knowledge and skills that an accountant and a lawyer need.  You can hire a friend, a neighbor's daughter or a second great-nephew.  The main thing is responsibility and discipline.  It is advisable to conclude a contract of <nobr>civil</nobr> nature in order to avoid legal battles. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/ffd/1e4/794/ffd1e47944c884fb04a6121a11b9e43b.jpg"><br><br><h6>  To suit </h6>  For those who need a personal approach.  Theoretically, when a business has an office with a reception, the remote employee will be able to get the <nobr>level-up</nobr> to full-time.  In this case, the entrepreneur does not have to re-acquaint the person with the internal cuisine of his company. <br><br><h6>  How much is </h6>  10 000‚Äì30 000 rubles per month. <br><br><h6>  Links </h6>  <a href="http://www.superjob.ru/resume/search_resume.html%3Fsbmit%3D1%26t%255B0%255D%3D4%26t%255B1%255D%3D33%26keywords%255B0%255D%255Bsrws%255D%3D7%26keywords%255B0%255D%255Bskwc%255D%3Dand%26keywords%255B0%255D%255Bkeys%255D%3D%25D1%2581%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BA%25D1%2580%25D0%25B5%25D1%2582%25D0%25B0%25D1%2580%25D1%258C%26search_hesh%3D43658124047204%26main%3D1%26catalogues%3D8%26detail_search%3D1%26strict_place_of_work%3D1%26place_of_work%3D2">SuperJob</a> , <a href="">HeadHunter</a> <br><br><h4>  State employee </h4><br>  The secretary in the office is a category overgrown with a bunch of cliches and stereotypes.  If you believe humorous jokes, the secretary‚Äôs duties include covering horn plates with paints and varnishes, transporting tonic drinks and hunting for a hand, heart, and a purse of a boss.  In his spare time from these important activities, the secretary is engaged in sorting mail, receiving calls and visitors, purchasing office supplies and clearing tasks that the manager does not like. <br><br>  If the secretary works hard and does more than is expected of him, there is a chance to earn the ‚Äúpersonal assistant‚Äù or <nobr>‚Äúbusiness assistant‚Äù</nobr> .  This person is needed not only and not so much in order to shift the pieces of paper and press the buttons of the coffee machine.  This is the very healthy head on which you can shift the problems with the patient, the second memory and the third hand of the entrepreneur. <br><br>  The assistant with the prefix "personal" is sharpened to fulfill the whims of the entrepreneur - <nobr>somewhere to</nobr> order <nobr>something</nobr> , collect information, make an appointment, <nobr>run away-bring</nobr> (the clinical case is perfectly <a href="http://www.the-village.ru/village/situation/howto/137921-kak-vse-ustroeno-lichnyy-assistent">described in the first person</a> ).  The <nobr>‚Äúbusiness class‚Äù</nobr> assistant is, in fact, the executive director in miniature, who often knows more about the company's operating activities than the business owner.  He helps to organize <nobr>business processes</nobr> , can independently communicate with customers and suppliers, and sometimes even make decisions and give advice to his boss. <br><br>  This profession is not taught at the university, so it is unlikely to find a solution out of the box.  If the level of an accountant and a lawyer can be assessed at least by professional qualities, then the choice of personal assistant or <nobr>business assistant</nobr> requires a completely different approach.  In the selection of assistants in the Button, we use tasks that help assess the horizons, erudition, mobility, the ability to interact with people and work with new information.  Simply put, you need to look for a person who loves and knows how to learn and is ready to work without job descriptions.  This is the case when a person must organize the work of their leader, and not vice versa. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/6fe/4bb/8d8/6fe4bb8d86543694506a57319eb5e6ba.jpg"><br><br><h6>  To suit </h6>  The purpose of this category is clear without further ado.  The need for such employees arises from the owners of ‚Äúadult‚Äù medium-sized businesses and <nobr>top managers of</nobr> large companies.  In large intergalactic corporations, several people or even a couple of departments fulfill this role: <nobr>office managers</nobr> , a <nobr>call center</nobr> , the secretariat, and others like them. <br><br><h6>  How much is </h6>  30 000‚Äì50 000 rubles per month for <nobr>the assistant secretary</nobr> ; <br><br>  40 000‚Äì80 000 rubles per month for a personal assistant / <nobr>business assistant</nobr> ; <br><br>  100,000 and more for the class dude, ‚Äúmay a pink pony on a rainbow-colored Falcon 9 come flying to me right now.‚Äù <br><br><h6>  Links </h6>  Search for relevant requests for <a href="http://hh.ru/">HeadHunter</a> , <a href="http://superjob.ru/">SuperJob</a> . <br><br><h4>  What place does Button occupy? </h4><br>  <nobr>The business assistant</nobr> in the Button is the main person in the team from the point of view of the client - it is the <nobr>business assistant who</nobr> communicates with the entrepreneur, accepts tasks, transfers them to the button accountant or lawyer, or decides on his own.  The client may forget the name of the service, the address of our website or the color of the <a href="http://www.instavillage.com/%25D0%25BA%25D0%25BD%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BF%25D0%25BA%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BA%25D0%25BE%25D1%2582/">Button Button</a> , but he always knows his <nobr>business assistant</nobr> by name.  <nobr>The business assistant</nobr> , in turn, knows everything about the affairs of each client. <br><br>  In the course of development, we have several times rethought the role of the <nobr>business assistant</nobr> .  At first, he was perceived as a personal assistant, then as a secretary, but later, when our guys were very pumped up, we realized that they did an excellent job with the tasks that the <nobr>business assistant</nobr> usually performs.  Of course, the button assistant can <nobr>still</nobr> book a flight, find a good restaurant in an unfamiliar city, or record a pedicure, but he is capable of more. <br><br>  Working in a team with an accountant and a lawyer, our <nobr>business assistant</nobr> will help build <nobr>business processes</nobr> up to the launch of a new project or direction.  We hire these superheroes, they are constantly learning, working with different businesses and, at times, they know what you do not expect from them.  It‚Äôs unlikely to list everything without inflating the post to an unreadable footcloth, but you can read about a couple of real examples <a href="http://knopka.com/blog/post.php%3Fid%3Dchto-mozhet-knopka">on our blog</a> . <br><br>  And also the Button <nobr>Business Assistant</nobr> is a bank employee.  This facilitates interaction with <a href="http://bank24.ru/">our bank</a> : the entrepreneur does not have to call the <nobr>call center</nobr> to block the card, reserve the currency at the current rate or find out the status of the operation.  In addition, the <nobr>web interface</nobr> and the Buttons mobile application are also a convenient <nobr>online bank</nobr> . <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/1ad/7bc/85c/1ad7bc85c541ead0509d03febd886fef.jpg"><br><br><h6>  To suit </h6>  Using the button <nobr>business assistant</nobr> apart from the rest will not work, so you can confidently say that it will suit all customers of the Button.  That is, everyone who needs good accounting and legal services with an integrated approach to solving <nobr>business problems</nobr> , human communication and convenient applications.  Our guys will cope with any tasks that do not require their personal presence.  Of the minuses: no courier services, the assistant will not be able to devote all his time only to your business. <br><br><h6>  How much is </h6>  12 000 rubles for an accountant, lawyer, <nobr>business assistant</nobr> and banking services. <br><br><h6>  Links </h6>  <a href="http://knopka.com/">knopka.com</a> <br><br>  If you are still thinking about whom to entrust your accounting and legal support to, we recommend reading the <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/knopka/blog/218651/">first</a> and <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/knopka/blog/220323/">second</a> parts of our entertaining business in which we washed the bones of the Moscow <nobr>business services</nobr> market. <br><br>  At this our <nobr>mini-study</nobr> came to an end.  Many thanks to all who managed to finish reading to the end.  We hope we did not miss anything important and were fairly objective.  Wellcome in the comments. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/221327/">https://habr.com/ru/post/221327/</a></p>
