      It seemed that Habr is a get-together of specialists who share their own or not their thoughts and ideas, discuss them, think how to do something anyway, find a solution to a painful problem.  And of course sometimes laugh at something funny. <br>  But it turned out that this is not entirely true.  It is necessary to observe that a witty comment on the mistake of the author of a topic or another comment has more weight than the entire article under discussion. <br>  Often, the discussion of the article goes into the background, but something valuable is lost in a pile of unnecessary words. <br><br>  Now closer to the topic, how to eliminate errors. <br>  I had one suggestion for a small change in the interface to a person close to something unusual, like a UFO (as I thought): <br>  <i>Often, reading the authors' stories on Habr√©, you see errors in the text.</i> <i><br></i>  <i>Sometimes there are a lot of them and such stories do not cause anything positive.</i> <i><br></i>  <i>Often stories are very interesting and you try to help correct occasional single errors, but for this you need:</i> <i><br></i>  <i>1. Remember where this error is in the text.</i>  <i>With a large volume, it is necessary to run through the text once again after reading it.</i> <i><br></i>  <i>2. Write a letter to the author: to do this, a lot of actions, which is not always desirable.</i> <i><br><br></i>  <i><b>Sentence.</b></i> <i><br></i>  <i>Change the interface so that the actions for indicating an error are made maximum in a couple of mouse clicks.</i> <i><br></i>  <i>For example, select an error fragment and select ‚ÄúError‚Äù from the context menu.</i> <i><br></i>  <i>Or select and press any button.</i> <i><br></i>  <i>Or run this proposal for discussion Habra, users will offer another option to highlight the error.</i> <i><br><br></i>  <i>Later on, what was singled out as an error falls to the author - either in the form of a message from the administration, or in a personal, or formed in some button in the article that the author sees.</i> <i><br></i>  <i>You can also discuss this point.</i> <i><br><br></i>  <i>Then the texts will be better and faster correction of errors.</i> <i><br></i>  <i>References to errors in the text will leave comments.</i> <i><br></i>  <i>Very often you can see how good the content of the text goes into the minus because of the grammar and controversy in the comments.</i> <i><br></i>  <i>Perhaps something like that already exists on Habr√© and I just don‚Äôt know about it?</i> <i><br></i> <br>  The answer was: <br>  <i>We already have a well thought out idea on this issue and soon we will start to implement it;)</i> <br><br>  A lot of time has passed, the change occurred only in the ability to edit the comment, but this did not solve the problem. <br>  If the author made a mistake and did not see it within 3 minutes, then the mistake and its discussion remain. <br><br>  Therefore, another cardinal proposal appeared: to <b>eliminate errors in principle</b> . <br>  When writing an article / comment, when an error occurs, the word is underlined in red.  But many people do not see this because of inattention, haste or not enough fat lines when underlined. <br><br>  It is necessary to modify the interface so that in principle it does not miss the article / comment in the presence of a spelling error. <br>  In those few cases when a person deliberately writes with an ashipka, the author marks with a tick that he is familiar with the warning, and the article / comment is published. <br><br>  Technical errors, as in the case of placing images that have huge sizes can also be eliminated at the stage of writing the article.  The fact that Google Reader (it is possible that some other systems) does not reduce the size of the pictures is known not to everyone, so you can immediately automatically notify the author at the placement stage and get his decision.  The author agrees with this warning or not, this is his problem. <br><br>  We now turn to the estimates.  For many people, it is often not clear why this or that evaluation was made.  Well, if a person commented on his decision, but in most cases, estimates are made just like that, without giving reasons, even after the request of the author. <br>  The reasons for this or that assessment can be understood if you do the following. <br>  When I try to put a plus or a minus for an article, comment or karma, an additional menu appears (or somehow differently) that contains (you need to think about which items to include in different cases, I put a small amount for an example): <br>  - content; <br>  - usefulness / uselessness; <br>  - novelty / button accordion; <br>  - very competent / errors; <br>  - it is very necessary / nobody needs it; <br>  - I am for this / I am an opponent of this; <br>  - many letters; <br>  - few letters; <br>  - forgive from the sandbox / this is unforgivable; <br>  - other. <br><br>  Also, when viewing an article or a comment, it is not clear if the score has changed or not? <br>  A modified assessment can be distinguished (in color, size, boldness, dimness) so that it can be seen: zero is like that since birth or is it the result of a conflict of opinions. <br><br>  As a result, each assessment will be disclosed: for what and by what criteria. <br>  When you hover on the assessment clarified by what parameters the article / comment is good or bad. <br>  But in addition, a portrait of the readers will be revealed and it will become clear what they want and what they want. <br><br>  There are still stylistic mistakes, but there is no solution yet. <br><br>  In this way: <br>  - grammatical errors are excluded; <br>  - the comment and error dispute branch disappears; <br>  - the discussion becomes more productive; <br>  - the quality of articles and therefore, the prestige of Habr is improved </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/158253/">https://habr.com/ru/post/158253/</a></p>
