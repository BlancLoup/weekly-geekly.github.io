      Each of the senses has a ‚Äúlexical field‚Äù, a large palette of special words describing colors, sounds, tastes, textures.  And the smell?  In English, there are only three special words for the smell - smelly, fragrant, musty [stinky, fragrant, musty] - while the first two describe the subjective opinion of the sniffing, not the smell itself. <br><br>  All other descriptions of the smell relate to its sources: we say that the subject smells of cinnamon, roses, and youth (referring to the song ‚ÄúSmells Like Teen Spirit‚Äù by Nirvana, or, possibly, to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teen_Spirit_(deodorant)">Teen Spirit</a> deodorant), morning napalm (a reference to the words of the character of the film "Apocalypse Today" - approx. transl.).  Other feelings do not need such detours.  We do not need to say ‚Äúa banana looks like a lemon‚Äù - we can just say that it is yellow.  Experts working in the perfume and wine industry use metaphors like ‚Äúdecadent‚Äù or ‚Äúoily‚Äù - but try to explain these terms to those who are not experts. <br><br>  Some scientists believe that this fact indicates that the person pushed the smell to the back of the perception, relying on the vision.  This feeling is from the second echelon, which, according to Darwin, renders the person a ‚Äúnegligible service‚Äù.  Others believe that smell is basically impossible to describe, and that <a href="https://books.google.co.uk/books%3Fid%3DZpc2HbWbgTIC%26pg%3DPA4%26lpg%3DPA4%26dq%3Dolfactory%2Babstraction%2Bis%2Bimpossible%26source%3Dbl%26ots%3DSQ0eweKJc8%26sig%3DSrlHDhBZYlO3Sb5nStaNZd0NxV8%26hl%3Den%26sa%3DX%26ved%3D0CDAQ6AEwAmoVChMI4ujf1uD7yAIVw-wUCh1iNgrc">olfactory abstraction is impossible</a> .  Kant wrote that "The smell does not allow one to describe himself directly, but only by comparison with other feelings."  And when Jean-Baptiste Grenouille, the protagonist of the novel " <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Perfume-Story-Murderer-Patrick-S%25C3%25BCskind/dp/0141041153">Perfume. The Story of a Murderer,</a> " can unmistakably determine smells, remember them and mix them in his head, his ability confuses us and seems supernatural, precisely because we are in such things extremely bad. <br><br>  But not all.  In Southeast Asia, there are at least two groups of hunter-gatherers who would turn their heads at such allegations.  <a href="http://www.mpi.nl/people/majid-asifa">Asifa Majid</a> from the Redboud University in the Netherlands found out that there are 12 to 15 words <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maniq_people">related</a> to smells in the languages ‚Äã‚Äãof the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jahai_language">Jahai</a> ethnic <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jahai_language">groups</a> from Malaysia and the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maniq_people">manic</a> from Thailand. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  ‚ÄúThese terms mean a lot to them,‚Äù she says.  - They constantly appear in speech.  They are familiar to small children.  They are included in the main vocabulary.  They are not used to refer to tastes or edibility.  They are meant only for smells. ‚Äù <br><br>  For example, the word "litpit" describes the smell of <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%2591%25D0%25B8%25D0%25BD%25D1%2582%25D1%2583%25D1%2580%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B3">binturong</a> (they are also called "cat bears" because of the external similarity of the body structure with the cat and the manner of movement on the ground like a bear).  This two-meter animal resembling a shaggy otter with black fur is known for its odorous glands emit a smell resembling popcorn.  But ‚Äúltpit‚Äù does not mean popcorn - this term does not describe the source of the smell.  The same word is used for soap, flowers and durian fruit, and refers to one of those odor properties that the western nose cannot catch. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/131/888/3a5/1318883a56dc8b2de7b8917bc2477d09.jpg" alt="image"><br>  <i>Binturong</i> <br><br>  Another word means the smell of gasoline, smoke, bat litter, a type of centipede, wild ginger root, wild mango tree, etc.  One of the words, apparently, refers to the smell of fried food.  The other is about protein-type things, crushed lice, and other "blood smells luring tigers." <br><br>  These terms do not denote common concepts related to other senses, such as edibility.  ‚ÄúTheir meaning does not apply to tastes, sensations, pain, or other conditions.  They describe only the smell, - says Majid.  ‚ÄúJust as you would describe a tomato as red, a person from Jahai will describe the smell of binturong as ltpit.‚Äù <br><br>  For the first time, Majid heard about Jahai from her colleague Niclas Burenhult, who had worked with them for many years and wrote the only formal grammar of their language.  He noticed that they have special words for smells.  Regarding this with suspicion, she <a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S001002771300214X">flew to Malaysia</a> to conduct an investigation. <br><br>  She talked to them, studied their language and culture.  She tested them on the standard smells test (Brief Smell Identification Test), which uses fixed odors.  She walked with them through the jungle, and asked them to describe the smells of what was around them.  And through various checks, she showed that they call smells as consistently, simply and precisely as English-speaking people would call colors, without any language problems and somersaults, to which people of Western culture would resort.  The same is <a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0010027713002527">true for the Manic</a> . <br><br>  These two groups prove that smells, despite popular opinion, can be described.  ‚ÄúThis job has changed my ideas!‚Äù Says <a href="http://www.cf.ac.uk/biosi/staffinfo/jacob/">Tim Jacob</a> from the University of Cardiff.  ‚ÄúOdor information directly affects behavior, mood, and evokes memories,‚Äù he says.  - Smell language is not needed.  So I thought before.  But, obviously, some cultures have developed a vocabulary for smells that is useful and necessary. ‚Äù <br><br>  Or, as Majeed writes: " <a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S001002771300214X">Smells can be expressed in the language if you speak the right language</a> ." <br><br>  And if you speak the right language, it changes how you perceive the world.  The smell is an integral part of the culture of the jahai, which distinguishes it from the western.  ‚ÄúWhen we were there, Niklas and I said that we were brother and sister.  Once we were told that we should not sit too close so that our smells do not mix - this would be a form of incest, she says.  - There are social prohibitions expressed through smells.  Some dishes cannot be cooked in the same hearth with others, because their smells will mix. ‚Äù <br><br>  They also very well distinguish smells, at least, much better, than Majid.  ‚ÄúWe walked through the jungle during the wild ginger bloom season,‚Äù she recalls.  - One would think that this is one thing and one smell - but no.  The flower does not smell like the stem, and the stem smells differently, depending on whether it is compressed or broken.  I tried to call smells, and the kids ran after me and laughed.  Type: how can you be such an idiot? ". <br><br>  Next year, she plans to return to the tribe to find out how well they remember the smells.  She also thinks about collecting examples of smells that they describe in words, and see if she can isolate the chemical compounds that are common to them.  She also wants to compare their languages ‚Äã‚Äãand the languages ‚Äã‚Äãof other tribes of Southeast Asia, in order to understand how the words describing smells evolved from previous languages. <br><br>  ‚ÄúThis job is very important because it raises issues that were previously considered odd,‚Äù says <a href="http://www.psy.ox.ac.uk/team/charles-spence">Charles Spence</a> of Oxford University.  He is referring to people from Western, educated, industrial, wealthy and democratic countries ‚Äî those who do most psychological research.  ‚ÄúAnthropologists have been saying this for a long time, but psychologists ignore their advice.  It would be great to look at these beautiful examples, raising the smell from the bottom of the hierarchy. ‚Äù <br><br>  Jacob also believes that Jahai and Manik can give us a better understanding of the evolution of smell.  For example, it is obvious why unpleasant smells repel us - they are associated with decaying food, waste and other things that are potentially suffering from illness.  But why do we like pleasant smells?  Perhaps I‚Äôm prompted to give us manic people: the word for binturong is also used for medicinal plants with pleasant smells, which they use as perfume and necklaces. <br><br>  ‚ÄúIt seems to me that this is a revolutionary discovery,‚Äù says Jacob.  - Early cultures collected pleasantly smelling plants because they had medical or medicinal properties, or they personified purity and hygiene.  And now, finally, an example of the positive influence of pleasant smells, which gives adaptation advantages.  Moreover, he points to the origins of our passion for perfume. " <br><br>  Majeed rightly says: ‚ÄúWe spend millions on the fragrance and fragrance industry.  It‚Äôs too easy to assume that smell doesn‚Äôt matter to people. ‚Äù </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/395861/">https://habr.com/ru/post/395861/</a></p>
