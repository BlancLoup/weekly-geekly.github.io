My companion often at work was in the famous Bobruisk and noticed there were constantly 10-15 men who were hanging out on a small patch.  Each was with a bag and it is not clear what they did there.  It turned out that this is a kind of, let's say, exchange of people.  That is, the peasants had nothing to do, and who needed workers, they came to this site and chose suitable ones for themselves.  The devil knows who needs it, can unload the bricks, some cement.

    <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  In general, it was like a movie about Shurik, remember?  ‚Äú <i>Sandy pit - two people!</i>  "," <i>Meat Processing Plant ... I have not sent any applications for today!</i>  " <br><br>  Then they thought that people very often need such a side job.  Ie, what often does a man do on Friday night?  <s>Thumps</s> Seeks to work for the weekend.  Often sit behind the wheel and taxing.  These are those who have a car.  And most do not know what to do. <br><br>  The project was called <b>JobOnHour</b> .  It was meant that, on the one hand, people create applications, on the other hand, an employee seeks a part-time job for an hour, two, weekends, and nights.  Many people have situations in life when there is ‚Äú0‚Äù money in their pockets, and a week is left before their salary.  The outputs are different.  More often they turn to friends, neighbors, relatives.  But many in such moments think about a side job.  I would like to help these people. <br><br>  The four of them gathered together every weekend, discussing how and what to do about the project.  We drew the design, developed detailed documentation, decided to look for the programmer on the side because  There were no ‚Äúnecessary‚Äù programmers in the team.  Found a man who undertook to do everything.  For two or three months, this ***** drove us by the nose, something like even Kodil, but in the end it turned out that he had just prodinil us.  In principle, time has played in our favor, during these months some details were brought to mind.  Found another programmer, quite sane.  The new comrade has been developing the backbone from scratch for almost a year. <br><br>  Of the benefits: <ul><li>  easy search for the specialty you are interested in </li><li>  easy job search by employment groups </li><li>  interesting implementation of user profiles in the form of business cards </li><li>  search for questionnaires / vacancies literally hourly </li></ul><br>  The budget of the project was surprisingly small, invested in $ 1,800.  The bulk of the money went exactly to develop.  The little things given for the logo, host, domains, and I do not even remember what ... <br><br>  Everyone knows the project is like, but friends, acquaintances are one thing, it's time to put the site for public discussion.  We will be glad to constructive comments. <br><br>  <b>PS</b> <br>  Now, the biggest job will be on promoting the project.  Proposals for cooperation have been sent to all large companies providing work, writing pre-releases, printing posters for institutes and, of course, work is being done on the CEO, but it‚Äôs very interesting how you would promote this type of project. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/84467/">https://habr.com/ru/post/84467/</a></p>
