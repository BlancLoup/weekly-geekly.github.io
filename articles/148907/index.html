  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Seven practical methods and tools to optimize the work on the thesis</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Writing a quality master's thesis fully covering all sections of the study, core work, analysis and testing of the results is a complex and complex task, daily with various success being solved by many students around the world.  Unfortunately, the study of existing literature [1, 2], devoted to the subject of writing dissertation research, indicates the lack of materials describing the practical experience of using various methods and tools that allow not only to optimize the work on the dissertation, but also to improve the quality of the final result. <br>  In this article we will look at seven practical methods and tools, the use of which will allow for the holistic structuring and systematization of tasks, knowledge and various data obtained in the course of work with the dissertation: <br><ol><li>  Formation of the structure of tasks. </li><li>  Search for literature in catalogs. </li><li>  Collection, processing and systematization of information. </li><li>  Formation of the list of references. </li><li>  Making a plan for milestones. </li><li>  The definition of the subject of study. </li><li>  "Summary" for the supervisor. </li></ol><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  <strong>1. Formation of the structure of tasks.</strong>  To solve the problem of structuring information, it is advisable to use the Mind map construction method [3].  There are a large number of software that allows you to build such "mind maps", for example, MindManager, ConceptDraw, as well as a large number of web services, for example, <a href="http://www.mapmyself.com/">www.mapmyself.com</a> . <br>  The first stage always requires planning - identifying all the necessary tasks solved in the course of work on a thesis.  Based on the best practices devoted to the description of the content of the thesis [4, 5], the reference structure of all possible types of tasks that can be solved while writing a thesis was formed.  The developed reference structure in the form of a mind map can be downloaded at <a href="http://sdrv.ms/RJEJH5">sdrv.ms/RJEJH5</a> .  Based on this template, the content of the thesis itself is formed, choosing the tasks that are necessary for the selected subject of work, an example is available at <a href="http://sdrv.ms/QNFnU1">sdrv.ms/QNFnU1</a> . <br><br>  <strong>2. Search for literature in catalogs.</strong>  At the first stage of research, it is often difficult to determine the direction of a literature review, which sources can provide a holistic view of the issues involved.  To solve this problem, it is recommended to use various general and thematic electronic catalogs, which are now on the Internet a great many.  In addition, very often helps the use of "virtual reference", where on a given topic, form a list of current and modern literature.  For example, it is definitely worth using the free service ‚ÄúVirtual Reference BIC Financial University‚Äù available at <a href="http://library.fa.ru/serv_help.asp">http://library.fa.ru/serv_help.asp</a> . <br><br>  <strong>3. Collection, processing and systematization of information.</strong>  In the process of writing a review on the subject under investigation, when collecting information, it is necessary to save and structure it in such a way that later it was possible not only to quickly search for the article or book, but also to perform full-text information search.  For these tasks, there are special tools that allow you to provide the necessary functions without extra effort.  The use of the following tools is recommended: Microsoft One Note, Mendeley (see <a href="http://www.mendeley.com/">http://www.mendeley.com/</a> ), Zotero (see <a href="http://www.zotero.org/">http://www.zotero.org/</a> ).  All tools allow not only to structure the saved files and web pages, to carry out full-text search, but also to solve the problem of generating a list of references.

      <strong>4. Formation of the list of references.</strong>  The formation of a properly designed list of references in accordance with GOST R <nobr>7.05‚Äì2008</nobr> requires very large temporary labor costs.  In order to optimize this work, you can use one of the following approaches: <br><ul><li>  Creation and subsequent generation of the list of references in Word (for this it is necessary to use the built-in mechanism "List of references", to generate a list in accordance with GOST, you must use a specially configured template ( <a href="http://goo.gl/Q2Fw0">http://goo.gl/Q2Fw0</a> ). </li><li>  Inclusion of properly designed bibliographic references in the course of work with the help of footnotes, which, when finalizing the work, are transferred sequentially to the general list. </li><li>  Using the tool Mendeley or Zotero to generate a list of references in accordance with GOST (see <a href="http://chetvericov.ru/faq-po-mendeley-i-zotero/">http://chetvericov.ru/faq-po-mendeley-i-zotero/</a> ). </li></ul><br>  <strong>5. Drawing up a plan (plan for milestones).</strong>  When all tasks are structured and defined for work planning and monitoring deadlines, it is necessary to form a specific plan.  Experience shows that scheduling when writing a dissertation is a very difficult task, and often unrealizable.  The best management tool in the face of such restrictions is to draw up a plan for milestones.  Table 1 provides an example of a plan that you can use.  This template provides an understanding of the relevance of the tasks with the results and content in the thesis, as well as the timing of their preparation. <br>  Tab.  1. Template "Plan for milestones" <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/37c/5d6/7ed/37c5d67ed6548a44a6213f1f7d5830c8.png" alt="image"><br><br>  <strong>6. Definition of the subject of study.</strong>  Any dissertation research often lies at the intersection of various areas of knowledge.  The following approach is recommended for structuring information: <br><ol><li>  identify all areas of knowledge of the topic (optimal number 3); </li><li>  for each of the areas of knowledge to identify key approaches that are currently used (based on the results of the literature review); </li><li>  determine the features (difficulties, problems) arising at the intersection of each of the areas, determine the problem and approach to the solution; </li><li>  to harmonize all intersections to determine the main subject of the study, the problem and the approach to the solution. </li></ol><br>  An example can be found at <a href="http://sdrv.ms/R7t42g">sdrv.ms/R7t42g</a> . <br><br>  <strong>7. "Summary" for the supervisor.</strong>  In order to at any time, day or night, to answer any questions about their work;  remember key points as a multiplication table;  to show the supervisor, mentor, or any third-party person for the assessment, it is necessary to compile and constantly update a file of <nobr>1-2</nobr> pages covering the following sections: <br><ul><li>  Topic title </li><li>  Relevance </li><li>  Purpose of the work (problem statement) and problems to be solved </li><li>  results </li><li>  Scientific novelty </li><li>  Theoretical significance </li><li>  Practical significance </li><li>  Object of study </li><li>  Subject of study </li><li>  Basic research methods </li></ul><br><br>  Thus, this article presented the experience of using seven methods and tools to optimize the work on the thesis. <br><br>  <strong>Literature</strong> <br>  1.
