Many web studios do not like working with fools.  Every second customer is inadequate for them, with bad orders at ridiculous prices.  But wait, are you cool enough to behave like that? <br><br>  Why in web studios often behave as if the client is a fool and does not know anything?  How is your work different from a hairdresser or a mechanic?  From the point of view of work performance - perhaps, from the point of view of the level of service and licking a client - no. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/fbf/938/a2d/fbf938a2df0907d4696345a3c2cbe6f9.jpg"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  I have the honor to introduce myself: My name is Sergey, I am a specialist in social and cultural services and my specialty is VIP customer service.  Every man's caprice has its purpose and its price.  This specialist finds what the client needs, even when he himself has not realized it yet.  And the most important thing: the service is that the client does not bother at all for nothing and knows what they will do to EVERYTHING.

      And so, my brother asked me to make a website for his company.  A small web project with a budget of $ 10k.  I made the necessary inquiries and found peace of mind, since I had plenty to choose from. <br>  And what happened next, let me describe with a bit of laughter.  With the charm that is peculiar to a man who met a jester, inflated in the image of the king: <br><br>  1) The first web studio was located in an office building.  Going inside, I was met by a manager-guy who, during a conversation, set himself a goal - to find out how much money I have.  He did not need to know what project, for what, who, in what time frame.  The main thing is the budget. <br><br>  Quite a strange move: to find out the budget without knowing the goal.  I felt like a vagabond who came into the store, and he was asked on the threshold: ‚ÄúDo you have money to buy anything?‚Äù. <br><br>  After I told them about the budget, they said: ‚ÄúYes,‚Äù and took the project description to read.  But a day later it was said that they would not be able to complete the project, since it is too complicated and they need to double the budget. <br><br>  I have completely lost interest in this company, but I decided to find out how competent they are in these matters.  Professional interest, so to speak.  I began to bargain with them.  After half an hour I was able to reduce the budget by half. <br><br>  It is difficult to believe people who agree, then increase, then reduce the budget.  But at the entrance I was told: "We are the best web studio."  If you say something, then keep the word.  If you are not self-confident, people will not believe you. <br><br>  2) Studio number two.  In this studio, I came across a really very good manager who told me about all the stages of creation, about the approximate cost, but unfortunately: <br><br>  "If you want, you can go to other web studios and see what they offer you."  Yes, and it was said with an arrogant tone.  No, guys, that's not right.  If a person came to you, then he had a reason for it.  And sending it to competitors is a gross mistake.  You show him your indifference.  And most importantly, he will go and look, and he will not return to you again. <br><br>  Man needs your understanding.  He has money, but he does not have what you have, namely, knowledge and experience.  No need to load it with professional terms, and then pretend like: "Oh yes, again a fool." <br><br>  Yes, they made me feel like a fool, moreover purposefully and openly.  And, as you know, no one likes to be in this position.  Inflated cheeks, slamming the door, I was like that! <br><br>  3) Going into the office, I saw a delicious lady playing in the zoom and corresponding in ICQ.  And after the words: ‚Äúwait 5 minutes, I‚Äôll finish the level‚Äù, I apologized, said that I went in the wrong place and left. <br><br>  Either this company is doing very well, which they can afford to wait for customers, or they have missed the main connection: if there are no customers, everyone will not care what you know and can do. <br><br>  Yes, I still found a company that gave me enough time, where the manager was really interested in my problem.  And believe me, they did not say that they were the best, they just did what I needed.  I was pleased to cooperate with this company. <br><br>  I have a question for web studios: ‚ÄúDo you really not have enough money to put in an adequate manager who will be able to talk with clients?‚Äù It is unpleasant to talk with a developer who uses terms and shows his superiority over you.  Talking with a girl who ‚Äúpokes‚Äù on ‚Äúbuttons‚Äù and ‚Äúlaziet‚Äù on sites is stupid. <br><br>  You provide a service, and this involves communicating with people who have their own views, values ‚Äã‚Äãand stereotypes.  If a person turns to programmers, show him a specialist in a sweater and glasses, let him think that "you are really professionals."  Yes, it is stupid and stupid, but it‚Äôs better than arrogant managers. <br><br>  Guys, life is beautiful and all people are entitled to their whims, but you, as a commercial company that aims to make a profit, should be loyal and patient to the oddities of people. <br>  Pay attention, but almost all your customers are quite normal people, but when they come to you, they immediately become ‚Äúdifferent.‚Äù  Maybe it's not about people, but about you? </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/147035/">https://habr.com/ru/post/147035/</a></p>
