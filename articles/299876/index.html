  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Promotion of the provincial online store at the start</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  I continue to write about my experience in provincial e-commerce. <br>  Today I want to tell what methods of promotion and what effect was achieved in the promotion of the ward online store (IM).  All methods and techniques are not mine, I just applied them to myself. <br><br>  <b>Start</b> <br>  The better and more thoroughly you prepare the site for the buyer, the more effective its promotion will be and, accordingly, more sales will be. <br>  I won't talk about usability, but I will say a few words about the content (content). <br>  Everything that you do on the site should set up the buyer to get an answer to his question, and wanted to return to you, and best of all to share it with friends or like-minded people.  This is an important part of the promotion.  Due to the fact that the site is young and the search engine will look at it with skepticism, you need to focus as much as possible on the small audience that you can ‚Äúlure‚Äù in the ways described below. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  <b>contextual advertising</b> <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/29e/d69/9d9/29ed699d9d5a4dceb7b818d8f30ce2de.png"><br>  <sup>Demographics of visits</sup> <br>  For IM, I used advertising only on Google due to the fact that Direct from Yandex was expensive.  The budget did not exceed 15 thousand rubles for the first month.  And there was one nuance, in the company's settings it was stated that its display was scheduled for a time from 5:00 pm and until 10:00 pm on weekdays and from 10:00 am to 8:00 pm at the weekend.  This was done due to the fact that the main audience of IM were women with children under the age of 12 years who have a consolidated time at approximately designated hours.  This budget was enough for 2 weeks and allowed a good start at the very beginning. <br><br>  <b>Opinion leaders</b> <br>  The next step was to attract the leaders to the IM and create the right attitude to the goods and service.  Note: the sales conditions were such that the customer contributes 100% and cannot choose the color of the products. <br>  For this, a video blogger on Youtube was found with the most similar themes and with a fairly active (which worked with similar sites) target audience.  The blogger was given the main theses of the work of IM: 100% prepayment, the inability to take into account the wishes of the color of the product, payment for delivery at the expense of the buyer, the minimum order for several thousand rubles.  Such a promotion channel cost about 6 thousand, these are two orders that the blogger made and, accordingly, 2 videos that he shot.  The effect of working with Youtube was very interesting, the videos brought 100 people to the site each, of which more than 40 purchases were made using a special promotional code (which did not give any discounts, but was like a marker from the promotion channel).  Plus, the blogger independently made several orders at his own expense and also took 3 more videos in addition.  We have got an excellent experience with this channel of attraction and will use it further, but we must be very selective in this issue.  We had a blogger with a small group of subscribers, a little more than 8 thousand, but the fact that he shot videos as appropriate as possible and rarely had 1,200 views gave us the conclusion that his audience is loyal and will listen to his words.

      <br>
      <b>Sharing (not only in the social network)</b> <br>  On search engines, the world has not come together, and therefore the social networks, specialized forums and websites are what you need to pay attention to when promoting your IM.  We knew for sure that some of our customers were on specialized forums, groups and websites for mothers, and therefore began to actively work with administrations and members of such communities.  This promotion channel is very flexible and diverse, I cannot give specific amounts, but the order of prices for placing information on them was from 0 rubles (good people) and not exceeding 1 thousand rubles.  6 thousand rubles were spent on this channel for 1 month, which gave a tremendous positive effect from a long-term perspective, for example, other communities and forums began to post information about us completely free of charge.  I want to add that we specifically abandoned the use of watermarks in photographs and made it possible to use them freely on our resources, due to the fact that we have an exclusive product for the most part we did not worry about what they would use and donate at our expense. <br><br>  These are not tricky ways of promotion, we used at the beginning and use now, and of course website optimization for search engines, but I will tell you about it next time. <br>  I really hope that in the comments you share your experiences and ideas. <br>  Thanks for attention. <br><br>  UP: Corrected errors and omissions in the text.  Thank. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/299876/">https://habr.com/ru/post/299876/</a></p>
