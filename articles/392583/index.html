  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Mother smoking alters fetal DNA</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  A study of more than 6,000 mothers and their newborns revealed that women who smoke cigarettes expose their children to DNA changes.  Separate areas in babies vary as in adults. <br><br>  The study potentially explains the connection between smoking during pregnancy and health problems in children - including the cleft lip, cleft palate and susceptibility to cancer. <br><br>  <i>In the illustration of the article on the study was an image of a pregnant woman with a cigarette in her hand.</i>  <i>We will not promote smoking, so keep a photo of a cute baby.</i>

Changes occur the same as in adults who are subject to this habit.  This relationship was also found in other studies, but for the first time, 6,685 babies and mothers were included in one sample. <br><br>  Based on the survey, women were divided into those who daily smoked during pregnancy - 13%, non-smokers - 62%, and those who occasionally indulged in cigarettes during pregnancy or quit in the early period - these were 25%. <br><br>  For the analysis of neonatal DNA methylation, researchers collected umbilical cord blood after delivery.  In newborns whose mothers constantly smoked during pregnancy, scientists found 6073 sites where DNA was chemically modified and looked different than in non-smoking mothers.  Half of these sites are tied to specific genes. <br><br>  London and colleagues discovered that these genes are responsible for the development of the nervous system and lungs, and for the development of cancer associated with smoking.  Some changes can cause various defects in children, including the cleft lip and cleft palate.  I advise you not to search Google for photos of children with these defects - the spectacle is not for the faint of heart.  All this requires special care for babies and surgery. <br><br>  Stephanie London notes that scientists already knew about the connection between the smoking of the mother and the cleft lip and palate of the child, but did not understand how this defect develops.  Perhaps, we are talking about DNA methylation. <br><br>  Earlier, I wrote that <a href="https://geektimes.ru/post/267236/">dads also eat for two</a> - the semen contains information about the weight of the father.  The study explained why the children of fat fathers are prone to being overweight. <br><br>  Take care of your health and think about the health of future children. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/392583/">https://habr.com/ru/post/392583/</a></p>
