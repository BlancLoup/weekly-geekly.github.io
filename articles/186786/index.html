Yes, at the end of its ‚ÄúRussian navigation path,‚Äù Mio attempted to switch to Navitel, but ultimately could not compete with significantly cheaper (and no less high-quality) models of local brands. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/5d9/0f9/32c/5d90f932ca8a31b276e558acc0f63bc4.jpg"><br>  Mio Navigator <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Some statistics: according to analysts, in 2009, Mio took the third place in the ranking of the largest navigation brands (8.3% of the market), and by the end of 2011 it did not even make it to the TOP-10.  In 2012, in fact, the departure from the navigators and the transition to car DVRs took place.  The company itself explained it this way (quoted from the Mobile-Review site: <a href="http://www.mobile-review.com/articles/2012/press-mio.shtml">www.mobile-review.com/articles/2012/press-mio.shtml</a> ): ‚ÄúSoftware solves a lot in the market of navigators, now the best software monopolist is Navitel, and , in fact, the simplest device with Navitel installed is enough to work as a navigator.  We do not plan to go down in the budget segment, so we decided not to release navigators. ‚Äù  For the sake of fairness, it‚Äôs worth adding that in some places in the world, Mio‚Äôs custom GPS navigators are still present in stores and are at least selling, but perhaps their most key market, Russia, has been lost by Mio.

      To Mio and its recorders, we will return, but a little later. <br><br>  And now it‚Äôs worth remembering the Korean company <b><i>Cowon</i></b> , which produces good music players.  I still remember warmly the forum battles of about seven years ago, when lovers of ‚Äúwarm and lamp‚Äù on raised tones tried to find out what is better - Cowon or iPod, iPod or iriver, Walkman or Cowon and so on.  Cowon then belonged to the first echelon of manufacturers of players and did not know grief, but now this market is melting every year: there are iPod players, which, due to the popularization of the iPhone and the advent of iPad mini, are selling worse (in one of the latest quarterly reports, Apple even broke the tradition and did not indicate the number of players sold: <a href="http://www.digit.ru/business/20130522/401675593.html">www.digit.ru/business/20130522/401675593.html</a> ), there is Sony, which seems to be still ‚Äúfloundering‚Äù in this segment, and the rest ... In Russia, the players are only doing local brands, and most of their devices refer to  Assou "can sing and costs around a thousand."  For example, the St. Petersburg brand teXet is sure that it has second place in this segment: <a href="http://www.nomobile.ru/opinion/161216.html">www.nomobile.ru/opinion/161216.html</a> . <br><br>  Cowon companies, whose players always cost a lot of money, were not very comfortable in this ‚Äúnew world‚Äù, and it also switched to DVRs.  Korean players also seem to be releasing, but these are not new models, but, rather, updated versions of old ones - with a slightly modified design and redesigned software. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/c09/1a2/f76/c091a2f76ccd9a4259f56724c6d04b80.jpg"><br>  DVR Cowon Auto Capsule AW1 <br><br>  And the other day a press release about the beginning of Russian sales of the <b><i>Garmin</i></b> dashcam fell to me in the mail.  Here is what a thing: the position of this company in the world is not at all cloudless (for which it is worth saying thanks to Google and its free Google Maps service, in which the navigation option appeared and the ability to work offline), and in Russia it‚Äôs like joints .  Three and a half years ago, the word Garmin was synonymous with the word ‚Äúcar navigator‚Äù in Russia, and the company was the leader of the Russian market for such devices: in the sales ranking in 2008, it ranked first, in 2009 ‚Äî the second (23.1% against 28.3% of the leader at the time - the Explay brand), in 2010 its share fell to 7.48% (fourth place in the ranking).  In 2011, the brand controlled about 2.4% of the market (ninth position in the rating).  In 2012, Garmin did not hit the top ten. <br><br>  There are several reasons for this state of affairs. <br>  <i><u>The first</u></i> and main one is a branded navigation program, which cannot be officially replaced by another, and inaccurate maps of Russia. <br>  <i><u>The second</u></i> is a very specific technology for obtaining data on traffic jams on the FM channel called TMC.  It would seem easier to implement a GPRS modem or Bluetooth module in the navigator (which Garmin did in a number of recent models - more than two years later than the main players on the domestic market), but no, the American company continued to offer the same in Russia as in their native USA.  That is, completely ignoring the specifics of the Russian market. <br>  <i><u>The third</u></i> reason - all the same local brands that offer a complex of the best for the domestic realities of software and the navigator itself for far less money.  The average Garmin navigator costs about 10 thousand rubles, the equivalent, for example, from Lexand or any other Russian brand - 4 thousand. <br>  <i><u>The fourth</u></i> reason - a very strange attitude to the advertising of their devices.  Garmin believes that promotion on the Internet is from evil, user communities are evil, and social networks are generally a branch of hell on Earth.  But to place a five-line description of the new navigator in the lower corner of the page of the magazine - this is the most it (the main thing is that a naked girl with a cool tattoo is next): <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/f23/179/77c/f2317977cf53a0cccb5539643cc83713.jpg"><br><br>  Another example of a Garmin megacreativ is a billboard directed against the movement of cars (I wonder if many pedestrians buy navigators for themselves?), And with partially disabled lighting.  Money such advertising costs hoo much, but here its effectiveness in the case of Garmin is close to zero. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/5e9/a29/5dc/5e9a295dc85b35a1970b7ea9475d6652.jpg"><br><br>  And now let's take a look at the Garmin DVR, called the GDR 35. It looks like this: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/c71/f38/e36/c71f38e36c4acef66343709d31b654e4.jpg"><br><br>  And almost all the representatives of the latest Mio line look like this (there are many models, I will not list everything, I‚Äôll just note that they, like the GDR 35, are equipped with 2.4-inch screens and GPS modules): <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/bff/fc8/ba8/bfffc8ba8d226b776549ffe4c70a093f.jpg"><br><br>  It is clear that if a company wants to enter a completely new market for itself, then it can‚Äôt do without assistance from others in most situations.  When Nokia developed its first and last BookLet 3G netbook, she turned to Compal for help.  When Dell decided to enter the Indian smartphone market, it did so with two ZTE models, in which Dell had only logos.  Garmin chose the path of Dell: having lost the Russian market of navigators, the company begins a ‚Äúcrusade‚Äù in the segment of recorders with such an inauthentic model, which is practically no different from what Mio.  Care about the image?  No, not heard. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/868/108/291/8681082918679c4d366419b319e865c4.jpg"><br>  Dell XCD28 Smartphone <br><br>  And yes, our competent sources suggest that the Mio and Garmin recorders are made in the same factory somewhere in Southeast Asia.  At one time, we disassembled the ‚Äúidentical‚Äù teXet and AdvoCam models and found that they have completely different components inside: <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/smartgadget/blog/184198">habrahabr.ru/company/smartgadget/blog/184198</a> .  But if you disassemble the recorder Mio and Garmin GDR 35, then, most likely, we will see components - "twins". <br><br>  But it's not so bad.  Above, we talked about Garmin‚Äôs price policy that is not amenable to a logical explanation in Russia.  So with the registrars the same situation as with navigators: Garmin GDR 35 will cost ... do not believe it - 11 190 rubles.  For comparison: the oldest model in the Mio line is the MiVue 388, which also benefits Garmin in a number of parameters (for example, the resolution of its camera is 5 megapixels instead of 3, and the diagonal viewing angle of the lens is 120 degrees against 110) worth about 7.5 thousand.  But this, to be honest, is also expensive: the average price of a registrar in Russia today does not exceed 5 thousand rubles. <br><br>  According to Vedomosti (http://www.vedomosti.ru/newspaper/article/397851/registraciya_po_mestu_proezda), in the middle of 2012, the share of the leaders of the Russian market for video recorders did not exceed 3-4 percent - and Mio is not among these leaders It was, despite the relatively high fame of the brand.  Presumably, it is not in the top five (and the top ten, however, too) even now, in the middle of 2013. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/7df/3c5/dc3/7df3c5dc31cf7d7a5b12f9437fbc595c.jpg"><br><br>  In a press release on the GDR 35, Garmin pays special attention to the GPS module and the built-in database of speed cameras.  Well, what can we say here ... It is, of course, great, but the high (even not so: mega-high) price cannot be justified by this moment anyway.  Because for 9 thousand rubles you can take the hybrid Highscreen Black Box Radar plus, in which there is GPS, LED backlighting, the same base of speed cameras, and even a separate hardware radar detector with the ability to fix the Strelki-ST. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/e1f/be0/138/e1fbe0138c30e502e5bf6ae674b21c78.jpg"><br>  Highscreen Black Box Radar plus <br><br>  <i><b>The conclusions are simple</b></i> . <br>  The Russian market of recorders is this ... Um ... A cesspool, which even our merchants cannot always figure out.  Who grew up here and not the first year doing business.  That is why, according to analysts, over the course of a couple of years, the number of Russian players in the segment of registrars will be reduced by a factor of five - the strongest will survive, the weak will switch to something else (they will try to jump into the outgoing trains called smartphones, tablets and d.)  Foreign companies, by all appearances, should not be thrown here.  Who smarter - and does not fuss.  And who already have nothing to lose - put price tags at 7.5 thousand.  Or even 11 with a hook. <br><br>  PS In the next article I will talk about smartphones - how some domestic merchants are trying to conquer the domestic market with low-grade handicrafts made somewhere in Asia. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/186786/">https://habr.com/ru/post/186786/</a></p>
