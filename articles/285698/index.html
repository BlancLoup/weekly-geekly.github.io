  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Discipline or that damn workday</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  As a purely civilian, I despised most of my adult life the very word discipline.  It meant it: nasty government coercion to some kind of primitive senseless activity, like walking by a march, which no one in their right mind would choose for themselves.  Disobedience is punished with a stupid and hated superior force.  Unattractive characters on both sides of the disciplinary process.  Forcing - impenetrable "peaks" of anecdotes, reveling in their slice of power.  And disciplined - humiliatingly obedient sheep without their own will.  None of them do not pull. <br><br>  A fair amount of suffering for such a device of life goes to a civilian in office work.  We have to adhere to fixed working days and hours (who invented them at all?), And also sometimes sit at work when not working, and do objectively meaningless things.  It's no secret that there are days when it would be cheaper for an organization to just let us go home, on extraordinary paid holidays.  Just lie on the couch, sleep and gain strength.  On such a bad day, we are not workers, and there is no need for this disciplinary violence with more than modest results.  In the end, our business is to generate added value, and not to impress the authorities with the duration of their working day.  Having rested and recuperating, we will return with more energy and productivity. <br><br>  Advances in this direction have already begun long ago among management pioneering companies, such as Netflix, whose type of activity allows such experiments.  Flexible work schedules, lack of consideration for vacations and weekends, remote work, afternoon nap at will ‚Äî with all this, theoretically, for 10 years now, no one will be surprised.  They are really great!  After all, we all have different biorhythms, and how to spend a lot of forces on overcoming their nature, why should the working schedule not step aside and adapt to the person?  We are all for the perfect workflow - integrated into life, natural, into joy.

      However, lately I have been taking discipline with ever-increasing respect.  There are several reasons for this. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  To begin with, the discipline is not a spontaneous attack and not an evil uncle with a whip.  Discipline is the determination to fulfill intentionally assumed obligations.  Own choice to do something or not to do the same for a long time, as a result of our overall picture of what is right and what is not.  They say that Gogol spent a few hours every day, standing at the desk, which he had preferred to the desk since the times of Ganz Kuchelgarten.  In the days of apathy, when the literary process did not go on, he painstakingly covered the paper with phrases in the spirit of me today is not written.  If there is inspiration or not, please be in a position as if it is.  Limit your freedom to its desired application. <br><br>  Discipline provides tremendous savings of mental strength.  It is impossible every time the alarm rings to reconsider its intention to get up early.  His intention, you need to formulate once, in a sober mind, and then methodically enforce.  Just because it is necessary, so decided.  Without philosophies and alternatives.  Make so that the decision made one part of the brain, and their other adhered.  These processes are so different in nature and involve such different mechanisms of the psyche that switching to them too often is an extremely wasteful task. <br><br>  Finally, discipline is a giant multiplier.  What is done regularly is done quickly.  Just work every day at work.  Just every evening forty minutes to read books.  Or play the clarinet three times a week.  Or run cross.  Or write tempera.  And the surrounding gasp, how fast you are moving!  This is only a purposeless, watery life that flies by.  The same one that is subject to some kind of intention is much denser and lives much more intensively.  And the mechanism of this submission, this determination in actions, is discipline.  The same set of process objectives, about which I have already written <a href="http://megamozg.ru/post/5100/">earlier</a> , and which ensures progress on our chosen path. <br><br>  There is a fairly common myth that the slave standard of 40-50 hour work week leaves no room for life.  They say, if it were not for this hateful labor discipline, I would have turned the mountains in some sort of secondary field, and, alas, I am deprived of this opportunity.  However, the experience of a huge number of people, including my own, unequivocally states: modesty and structure gives much more chances to do something than just a large amount of unorganized time.  And people who by chance were left to themselves for a long time either spent it aimlessly and worthlessly, or very quickly fully harnessed to the discipline of another activity. <br><br>  ... It seems that the notion of discipline passed through all the stages of the classical <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hype_cycle">Hype cycle</a> in my life and relatively recently entered its ‚Äúproductivity plateau‚Äù.  There he stay. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/285698/">https://habr.com/ru/post/285698/</a></p>
