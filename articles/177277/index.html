This is a company that provides sales and download analytics for all platforms.  We often use this service in our work, and translations of some reports are provided to those clients who turn to us for advice.  I share the translation here, too.  The report should be useful to anyone interested in the mobile application market and the digital sphere in general.  In fact, in it we see the result of everything that, in particular, has been observed over the past months.  The current situation looks especially fascinating in the context of reports for the previous quarters: the mobile application market is extremely active and dynamic.  The original report is <a href="http://blog.appannie.com/app-annie-index-market-q1-2013/">here</a> . <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/f06/917/5fc/f069175fc76557e30a7b65a7a8776891.jpg"><br><br><a name="habracut"></a>

      In the quarterly market report from App Annie, not only the latest trends in downloads and sales on Google Play and the App Store (hereinafter referred to as ‚Äústores‚Äù) are considered, but also macro-level trends.  It helps, among other things, to determine the most profitable investment opportunities. <br><br>  <b>Key trends in stores, countries and categories</b> <br>  Over the last quarter, Google Play has achieved higher growth rates than the iOS App Store, both in downloads and in revenue.  However, despite the fact that in the first quarter of 2013, Google Play approached 90% of the number of downloads on the App Store, the latter maintains a strong leading position in terms of monetization, earning about 2.6 times more than Google Play.  For comparison, in the previous quarter, Google Play was 4 times behind on this indicator. <br><br>  Several countries showed a remarkable growth during the 4th quarter of 2012 and the 1st quarter of 2013. <br><ul><li>  The United States showed the largest growth in App Store revenue, and in China, not only did they download the most apps on the App Store, but also made purchases for a larger amount than in any other country. </li><li>  Russia has become a key factor in the growth of downloads on Google Play. </li><li>  In Japan and South Korea, Google Play continues to see a marked increase in revenue. </li></ul><br><br>  In all the countries mentioned above, games still lead as a growth factor, especially in terms of revenue growth.  By 2013, the category of games has reached such a level, which is the source of almost 70% of the App Store revenue and 80% of Google Play revenue.  There are several more categories, the incomes from which put them on high positions in ranking: <br><ul><li>  Photo and video applications have reached the third place in the number of downloads on the App Store </li><li>  Educational apps ranked fourth for iOS revenue sources worldwide </li><li>  Social apps rank fifth in Google Play categories </li></ul><br><br><h4>  Shopping figures </h4><br>  <b>Application downloads on the App Store vs.</b>  <b>Google play</b> <br>  <i>Google Play downloads accounted for about 90% of the App Store downloads in the first quarter of 2013.</i> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/4cc/5c0/7f0/4cc5c07f0f08bb13007073254125966f.png"><br><br>  <b>Revenues from the App Store vs. App.</b>  <b>Google play</b> <br>  <i>The iOS App Store received 2.6 times more revenue from apps than Google Play in the first quarter of 2013.</i> <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/cf9/c45/dae/cf9c45dae2cf3bb5bd67c913b1837c70.png"><br><br>  From the fourth quarter of 2012 to the first quarter of 2013, iOS App Store‚Äôs quarterly revenue grew by about a quarter.  Meanwhile, revenue from Google Play applications has grown by about 90%. <br><br><h4>  Country Indicators </h4><br>  <b>App Store: Leading countries in terms of downloads in Q1 2013</b> <br>  <i>China leads in downloads on the App Store</i> <br><br>  Leading countries in the number of downloads in the first quarter of 2013 <br><ol><li>  USA </li><li>  China </li><li>  UK + 1 * </li><li>  Japan, -1 * </li><li>  France </li></ol><br>  * index change in comparison with the previous quarter <br><br>  In the past quarter, the United States maintained its leadership position.  In recent months, China began to increase turnover in the iOS App Store and became the leading factor in the growth of downloads from Q4 2012 to Q1 2013. Although the games were the main category in download growth in China, revenues were also observed in many other categories.  Meanwhile, the United Kingdom and Japan were alternately in third and fourth positions over the past year.  Together, these leading countries came from about half the iOS downloads. <br><br>  <b>App Store: Leading countries in revenue in Q1 2013</b> <br>  <i>China reached the fourth position.</i>  <i>The USA and Japan gave half the store revenue.</i> <br><br>  Leading countries in revenue in Q1 2013 <br><ol><li>  USA </li><li>  Japan </li><li>  Great Britain </li><li>  China + 2 * </li><li>  Australia, -1 * </li></ol><br>  * index change in comparison with the previous quarter <br><br>  The United States and Japan remain the leaders of the App Store, providing about half of all store revenue.

South Korea and India retained second and third places after the United States, showing how much the Google Play Store differs from the App Store in the global market. <br><br>  <b>Google Play: Leading countries in revenue in Q1 2013</b> <br>  <i>First Japan, now South Korea ahead of USA</i> <br><br>  Leading countries in revenue in Q1 2013 <br><ul><li>  Japan </li><li>  South Korea, + 1 * </li><li>  USA, -1 * </li><li>  Great Britain </li><li>  Germany </li></ul><br>  * index change in comparison with the previous quarter <br><br>  Japan and South Korea continue their significant growth in 1 square.  2013 revenue by Google Play.
