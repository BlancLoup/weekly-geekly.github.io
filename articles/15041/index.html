You place on the site the so-called wish list (wishlist - list of desires).  Your friends who want to give you a gift, go to the site and choose one of the items from this list.  After that, they mark this item as reserved so that someone else will not give you the same thing again. <br>  Here is a list of Russian services of this type: <br><ul><li>  <a href="http://www.hachoo.ru/">Hachoo.Ru</a> </li><li>  <a href="http://mywishlist.ru/">MyWishList.ru</a> </li><li>  <a href="http://piggiebank.ru/">Moneybox Wishes</a> </li></ul><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  All these services, it seems to me, originated in the west.  There, even before the Internet era, such methods of gift selection were adopted.  For example, before the wedding, the newlyweds leave in the wishlist store of what they would like to receive as a gift.  All those invited are told in which store the wishlist is located.  Guests come to this store and choose from the list what they want to donate, after which the selected item is deleted.  This is very convenient for several reasons: <br><ul><li>  newlyweds do not receive unnecessary gifts </li><li>  guests can choose what they can afford </li><li>  no one will give the same thing twice </li></ul>  As with everything else, we see a classic example of Western pragmatism. <br><br>  Why am I doing all this?  Oh yes.  Quite by chance, I <a href="http://blogoscoped.com/archive/2007-10-12.html">came across</a> a similar, but slightly modified idea. <br>  A certain Belgian, Renaud, slightly modified the concept of gifts and created the site <a href="http://www.payittome.com/">http://www.payittome.com/</a> (pay for me).  So, what is the highlight of his ideas? <br>  In fact, this is a kind of hybrid wishlist and charitable activities.  On the site, anyone can write about what he would like to receive by attaching a photo with the price.  You must also specify an account on PayPal, where the money will be transferred.  After that, your desire appears on the site.  So far, everything is the same as in the case of classical wishlist.  The main difference is further. <br>  Fulfill desires are not offered to friends and acquaintances, but to advertisers who want to receive advertising on the resource.  The advertiser chooses the desired desire and transfers the desired amount to PayPal.  After that, the desire is marked as fulfilled and the logo and link to the advertiser (or sponsor, if you like) is placed next to it. <br><br>  This is the approach.  Let's see what happens next, but it seems to me that this undertaking is unlikely to become very popular.  First, the links that the advertiser receives will not be so weighty that it would pay back the costs (for example, the classic desire is a computer game, it costs from 30 bucks; for this amount you can buy a good fat link).  Secondly, as the authors of Blogoscoped note, these links will not be much different from those just purchased.  Knowing the attitude of Google to the purchased links, we can assume that these links will not have any effect on the popularity of advertisers sites.  Thirdly, with a sufficiently large number of fulfilled desires, references and references to advertisers will simply be lost in a huge stream, that is, this good deed will not bring even additional fame to the brand.  However, the author of the idea emphasizes the fact that it will be beneficial for advertisers to fulfill their wishes, which, as we see, is not quite right.

      Meanwhile, the idea is quite good.  Here you can only apply it a little differently.  This thought gave me a familiar girl.  For some time she worked as a volunteer in the organization "Nizhny Novgorod Service of Volunteers".  Volunteers go to the orphanage and make a list of the wishes of the children of this orphanage.  Then they come to the directors of enterprises and offer them to fulfill any desire of their choice.  For example, buy a radio-controlled machine.  What would all be without deception, entrepreneurs are invited to buy the gift themselves and take it to the orphanage themselves.  There, joyful children thank the entrepreneur, and everyone is happy (the children are a gift, the entrepreneur is themselves). <br><br>  The idea is that, using the Internet, bring this information to the greatest possible number of potential sponsors.  To do this, you need to create a website and place the following information on it: <br><br>  You can make such a site first for one region, and then add division according to the regional principle. <br>  By and large, the site will be a copy of the existing "gift" services, but with an emphasis on charity.  It will be possible to simply transfer money to the account of a non-profit organization giving it the opportunity to buy a gift.  You can advertise this site in local media, at various economic forums / fairs, etc.  Opportunities are many.  One has only to start thinking about it, as many ideas immediately arise.  The first example that came to mind is that each organization will have an account in the system.  This account can be screwed comments.  That is, those whom the organization has helped, will leave their reviews.  All the same, we have the era of web2.0 :) <br><br>  Theoretically, one can even think of how to monetize such a resource, but this is already the tenth thing.  The main thing is that this will allow to expand the possibilities of charity on the Internet. <br>  Here you go.  I decided to look for similar projects on the Internet.  Found the project <a href="http://blago.ru/">blago.ru</a> - a joint project of Yandex and CAF Russia (Charities Aid Foundation Russia).  At first I was upset.  Everything has been thought up before us.  Then I realized that by going to their website I don‚Äôt want to transfer money to anyone.  Somehow all too ... maybe officially. <br>  It seems to me that you need to make the site more "alive".  In order not just to transfer money to the charitable public organization ‚ÄúPerspectives‚Äù, but to help a specific children's home or a specific family.  And not necessarily money. <br><br>  Closer to this idea is the site <a href="http://www.wse-wmeste.ru/">All Together</a> Moscow Charity Meeting.  There are photos, detailed descriptions and much more.  Taking this project as a basis and refining it, you can get a very good resource that will really help people.  The most important thing, I think, is feedback.  A person who has helped someone (bought something or just transferred money for treatment) should see the result of his activity.  This will give him the necessary incentive for further charity, and indeed he will make it better, since people, by nature, tend to do good.  It is in our nature.  This initiative needs only support and give people simple tools to implement this assistance. <br><br>  In conclusion, I want to note that this is not a startup idea.  It is simply the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãa certain project that could provide real assistance to those who need it using the Internet. <br><br>  Original article on my <a href="http://web2x0.blogspot.com/2007/10/blog-post_15.html">blog</a> . </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/15041/">https://habr.com/ru/post/15041/</a></p>
