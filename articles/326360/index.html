Large banks and middle-aged developers are no longer enough for large banks and year-old startups - today everyone needs talents. <br><br>  ps space talents: like Korolev and Gagarin :) well, and Valentina Tereshkova!  Happy holiday, let's go! <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/362/9b5/d35/3629b5d352304ce5854230c7ed08b5fe.png"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  We talk about trends in 2017, which will help you stay on the market, find investments for your fintech product, or retrain in time.

      If you are currently looking for development opportunities in Fintech, respond to one of the <a href="https://go.open.ru/%3Futm_source%3Dhabr">internships</a> .  For example, a large and cool bank is launching as many as two programs: in one, you can <a href="https://go.open.ru/intern%3Futm_source%3Dhabr">start a career</a> in one of the departments (mainly IT specialists are needed), in the other, you can <a href="https://go.open.ru/startup%3Futm_source%3Dhabr">launch your startup</a> with an idea, a team, and generally. <br><br><h4>  1. Fintech companies will compete with banks for experts in machine learning. <br></h4><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/db5/8fe/6ca/db58fe6cabc245cf94ed6fe18836a192.png"><br><br>  And it will not be a cosmic battle, but quite real.  We see that the demand for machine learning specialists and those who were related to similar products is growing insanely. <br>  In short, machine learning is now at the peak of popularity in the financial sector - from banks and hedge funds.  Like AI, the trend will be the driving force in many areas in the near future, so strong Data Scientists are needed and they are hunted very quickly. <br><br><h4>  2. Fintech is hunting data analysts. <br></h4><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/6a8/710/268/6a8710268c7e4616b9af57e3d9f76ebe.png"><br><br>  We are talking about Machine Learning, AI.  But some are still unable to cope even with Big Data: the financial sector produces a huge amount of data, and some of them simply do not have tools for processing and analyzing.  Plus, sometimes cumbersome banks cannot quickly find and implement tools for analytics.  But now banks are dramatically raising the bar - a wave of technological solutions, young minds and progressive ideas has covered the sphere. <br><br>  There is a lot of data and there will be more and more, but so far there are not enough specialists (!) - now you know which profession is better to master in the coming year.  Yes, analysts are welcome and grab like hot space cakes. <br><br><h4>  3. Expertise solves <br></h4><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/f90/e1b/de8/f90e1bde8978497dbfef97bf28e01418.png"><br><br>  It is important to be a professional in several areas: the idea to generate, and the code to write, and ROI to calculate, and present the project to investors. <br><br>  Even if you have an ideal product and ready-made technologies for development - this may not be enough.  Learn to speak with top management in the same language and correctly explain why the bank does not live without your product, and your financial rocket will not fly away.  Learn to promote your ideas and be persuasive.  Competently prove the advantages of your product or project, as if they really were on the moon: D <br><br>  Bank managers, in turn, should also develop and learn at least one programming language at a basic level: you will be able to correct a small error on your own without the help of a developer and a loss of time - isn‚Äôt it a dream? <br><br><h4>  4. Fight for cyber security specialists <br></h4><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/4c8/e12/3da/4c8e123dabeb405395469bc000695abd.png"><br><br>  Fintech companies are looking for cybersecurity solutions for the banking sector, and large banks are increasingly investing in this area: from 5% of the total technical budget last year to 7‚Äì8% in 2017. There are not enough talents critically, some look Banks one of the "steps" of the rocket will fall off.  So the cyber security sphere is and will be extremely relevant. <br><br><h4>  5. Business experts are in demand again. <br></h4><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/1f8/0e1/25b/1f80e125bbaa4844908b8e48e6ecaac5.png"><br><br>  Some fintech companies live on money for venture funds: accurate business plans and monthly reports do not interfere with constantly trying out new sales models and customer interactions. <br><br>  But the market is growing and many of these companies are being blown away - it becomes obvious that everybody needs consultants and sales experts. <br><br>  Most are now aware that selling something to a large bank or an insurance company is a long, painful and uncertain process.  It is difficult to understand whether you are close to the deal or not.  Therefore, the main thing is to find people who understand the business processes of large banks and know how to communicate with them.  If you can and are ready to become an expert, pump over to sales and turn the most sluggish structure, go ahead! <br><br><h4>  6. HYIP around the blockchain will settle, and people will still be needed. <br></h4><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/205/0f8/f23/2050f8f239dc478c99c7fd51e79ba69c.png"><br><br>  The market lacks specialists in the field of distributed registries (distributed databases), which include the blockchain.  Experts who understand the financial ecosystem are wildly deficient.  This is a question of bias and basic knowledge. <br><br><h4>  7. New market players will download specialists from fintech <br></h4><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/a33/67b/2cd/a3367b2cd4b148b8bc6e951e3b4c3b54.png"><br><br>  Large e-commerce companies today are getting closer to financial business - they cannot do without talented developers and competent financiers.  Which now, as it happens, is largely concentrated in the field of e-commerce.  But times will change and the candidates will gradually be hunted into those areas that are right at the start before a sharp takeoff.  How finteh. <br><br>  Well, then you can not worry about a career.  After Finteha, the flight will definitely be great! </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/326360/">https://habr.com/ru/post/326360/</a></p>
