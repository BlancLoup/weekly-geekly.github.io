      You are not a bummer and feel tired at the end of each day.  It's not about motivation: you are inspired by those who have already embodied their dreams. <br>  It's not about confidence: you know that you have the abilities;  know that you have everything you need;  you can literally touch success with your hands.  But what is wrong? <br><br>  If everything is okay with diligence, attitude and willpower, why have you not yet achieved success? <br>  The main reason: you need to change the angle of view.  In other words, your idea of ‚Äã‚Äãsuccess is complete bullshit. <br><br>  This is not your fault.  As you grew up, a limited idea of ‚Äã‚Äãsuccess took root in your brain.  And you have been told that everything that does not fit into this pattern is considered a failure. <br><br>  You have been taught to determine success by the area of ‚Äã‚Äãa house, the cost of a car, or the amount of money in a bank account. <br>  And the truth is this: <a href="http://blog.mbaconsult.ru/blog/personal/5-knig-o-biznese-dobitsya-uspekha/">to succeed</a> , you do not need any of this. <br><br>  If in high school I was told that by the age of 22 I would live in a van in the Las Vegas area, working part-time in a company engaged in solar energy and devoting my free time to developing my own business, I would call my life an insanity. <br><br>  But today it is, and I really like it.  My income exceeds expenses, I sleep under the stars every night, and I spend most of the day helping others reach their goals. <br><br>  I changed my idea of ‚Äã‚Äãsuccess, and he found me. <br><br><h1>  <font color="#0071c5">7 true reasons why you are not doing well (and how to fix it all right now)</font> </h1><br>  There are many reasons for trouble.  Most of them are boring and monotonous.  Little experience, lousy genes, you need more money. <br>  If you need these prosaic reasons, you have come to the wrong address, you cannot find them here. <br><br>  But we are focused on results.  Every time I reach one of my goals, I feel such a strong tingling in my whole body that it makes me squirm. <br><br>  I want you to feel it too. <br>  And it all starts with a change in perspective. <br><br><h2>  <font color="#0071c5">1. You still use someone else's definition of success</font> </h2><br>  Your life is not like anyone else.  You have your own set of beliefs, values, goals, and your body to hold it all. <br>  You are unique. <br><br>  So why do you waste time using someone else's idea of ‚Äã‚Äãprosperity? <br><br>  In his ‚Äúformula for ultimate success,‚Äù Tony Robbins says: <br><blockquote>  A clear statement of your desires is the first and main point you need to go to in order to change everything for the better. </blockquote><br>  I could not express it better. <br><br>  Decide what you want, and that will be the definition of success.  Forget what others think. <br>  My components of success are helping others, living within our means and daily personal growth. <br>  This is your life, <a href="http://blog.mbaconsult.ru/blog/personal/9-melochey-imeyushchikh-ogromnoe-znachenie-dlya-schastya/">give your definition of happiness</a> . <br><br><h2>  <font color="#0071c5">2. You are afraid to ask for help.</font> </h2><br>  For some reason, there is a certainty that the path to success is a nameless forest trail that has never been walked on.  And only if you are lucky and you manage to get out of the thicket, then you will become a complete person. <br>  What kind of nonsense? <br><br>  In the famous book Think and Grow Rich, Napoleon Hill states: <br><blockquote>  It's really true: you can do better faster by helping others succeed </blockquote><br>  He wrote it in 1937.  Since then, millions of people have used this advice to climb to heights they never even dreamed of. <br><br>  The easiest way to grow is to help others grow.  Only this approach seems paradoxical, because you were taught to think that there is no wealth that can be shared with everyone. <br><br>  If you are only interested in personal growth or you think that you can succeed only in solitude, then you miss the most important thing. <br><br>  And this leads us to the following reason. <br><br><h2>  <font color="#0071c5">3. Your thirst for success is selfish.</font> </h2><br>  We are all somewhat selfish, and having such emotions is perfectly normal.  After all, having spent your life serving others, you will die in poverty. <br><br>  But if your thoughts of success only relate to raising the standard of living, you will never succeed. <br><br>  In the study of the side effects of greed and generosity, conducted by The Scientific American, it was discovered: generosity maintains health, and greed leads to stress and the production of cortisol, a stress hormone. <br><br>  The more you get, the more you have to lose.  If you want success only for yourself, then pay for your greed.  You will have a lot of money, but you will be bankrupt in pleasures, love, hobbies (besides the desire to save even more bills). <br><br>  Now you understand why a new car and a big house is the wrong definition of success? <br><br>  If I do not perfect the world, then I allow other things to destroy my goals, and I need to change my point of view. <br>  Apply strength and make the planet, which you call home, better compared to what it was when you were born.  Then you will never lose focus on success. <br><br>  The author of "Rework", Jason Fried, called it "leave a mark on the universe." <br>  Leave a large or small footprint that will live for many years after you leave. <br><br><h2>  <font color="#0071c5">4. You have a disgusting schedule.</font> </h2><br>  I know the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãmicro-management of life seems like torture.  I thought the same way, until I realized that I could not do anything. <br><br>  I was busy washing, answering emails, checking Twitter.  But <a href="http://blog.mbaconsult.ru/blog/personal/uchebnik-produktivnosti-ot-lezheboki/">there is a huge difference</a> between <a href="http://blog.mbaconsult.ru/blog/personal/uchebnik-produktivnosti-ot-lezheboki/">productivity and employment</a> . <br><br>  This was best formulated by the writer John Tolkien: <br><blockquote>  All we need is to decide what to do with the time allotted to us. </blockquote><br>  If you do not manage your time and do not think through what needs to be done, someone else will do it for you. <br><br>  Live Your Legend's Scott Dinsmo came up with an excellent weekly planning process that turns scheduling into a ritual that has become one of my favorite parts of the week. <br><br>  Spending an hour setting up important moments in the calendar will give you a clear idea of ‚Äã‚Äãthe steps that you need (or do not need) to take to achieve success. <br><br>  What is in your schedule will be done.  Clear and simple. <br><br><h2>  <font color="#0071c5">5. You stopped growing</font> </h2><br>  Here is one of the greatest misconceptions regarding success: once you have reached your destination, you are ready for life. <br>  This is just another lie that has been spread by society for years. <br><br>  Even becoming successful, you can still lose everything.  People who have received what they never had, do not know what to do with it. <br><br>  And they lose everything. <br><br>  In his book, The Laws of Constant Development (Laws of Lifetime Growth), Dan Sullivan spoke with businessman Dan Schmidt, who, to avoid stalling, asks himself: <br><blockquote>  If everything I've done so far is just the beginning, then what's next? </blockquote><br>  Go the other way: everything you know is just a piece of information circulating in the universe.  There is always room for development. <br><br>  It doesn't matter if you try to keep fit, start your own business or learn the secrets of cooking.  If you study, then grow. <br><br>  Cultivate your curiosity for everything, and you can never be afraid of a halt in your life. <br><br><h2>  <font color="#0071c5">6. You continue to look for short cuts or quick enrichment schemes.</font> </h2><br>  The only shortcut you need is so helpful that it can wipe the rest of your nose.  And I can show you it right now. <br><br>  Ready? <br><br>  There are no shortcuts. <br><br>  Do not believe?  Ask Richard Branson, one of the richest and most successful people in the world.  He said: <br><blockquote>  If you spend time searching for the shortest paths, then you will definitely find one of them - right out of business. </blockquote><br>  Rapid enrichment schemes are associated with theft from many for the indecent enrichment of several. <br>  Do you want to become such a person?  Is wealth the most important thing? <br><br>  If you are trying to lose weight, do you really prefer to take weight loss pills that destroy the body, rather than stick to a diet and exercise? <br><br>  The shortest paths exist only for destructive people who care only about themselves. <br>  You are not like that. <br><br>  Be strong and act wisely.  It may take more time, but as a result you will live better. <br><br><h2>  <font color="#0071c5">7. You are afraid of responsibility associated with success.</font> </h2><br>  The reason why people are so afraid of taking responsibility is: they do not know what will happen next. <br><br>  If you fail, what will others think?  Or even worse: how will you cope with the arising new load if you succeed? <br><br>  Tim Ferris, in his ‚ÄúFour Hour Work Week‚Äù (‚ÄúFour Hour Work Week‚Äù), writes that: <br><blockquote>  People will prefer uncertainty misfortune </blockquote><br>  They will rather lead a miserable life and give up their goals because they are too afraid to leave their own comfort zone. <br><br>  If you are going to succeed, you will have to take responsibility, and this is more difficult than making promises. <br>  Commitment is the secret ingredient for creating a dish that others will prepare according to your recipe, but the portions you have made will forever remain the most delicious. <br><br>  After all, the secret ingredient is love. <br><br>  Success is not only money, status, or even <a href="http://blog.mbaconsult.ru/blog/personal/7-shagov-navstrechu-svoim-tselyam/">achievement of goals</a> .  All of this is just by-products: it is pleasant to have them, but they are not as valuable as what true success really is. <br><br>  If you have not yet noticed: those who have achieved real success love their job.  No matter how simple or complex, easy or difficult.  They adore him, burning with passion. <br><br>  True success lies in falling in love with every aspect of the process. <br><br><ul><li>  He is in love with what you do. </li><li>  He is in love of failure. </li><li>  It lies in the love of triumphs. </li><li>  He is in the love of all those who helped you along the way. </li><li>  But to the greatest extent it lies in the love of self. </li></ul><br>  PS We recommend another article on the topic - <a href="http://blog.mbaconsult.ru/blog/personal/10-sposobov-izmenitsya-k-luchshemu-ne-menyaya-svoe-myshlenie/">10 ways to change for the better without changing your thinking</a> . <br><br>  Translated by Vyacheslav Davidenko, founder of <a href="http://www.mbaconsult.ru/">MBA Consult</a> . </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/300598/">https://habr.com/ru/post/300598/</a></p>
