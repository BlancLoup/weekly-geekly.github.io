    <h2>  Towards the consumer </h2><br>  In the review of the first digital state systems, we stopped at the 1980s and noted that by that time, thematic research groups had been formed in the States and several IT solutions had been implemented.  For example, filing tax returns through a single information portal. <br><br>  In the 90s, the term ‚Äúdigital state‚Äù did not exist yet.  He was offered later, but some ideas were already running.  In 1993, US President Bill Clinton attended to the problem of the effectiveness of the state apparatus and formed an analytical group.  In the same year, she presented a report that proposed steps to reduce the level of bureaucracy and reorienting to the needs of citizens. <br><br>  In 1997, <a href="https://govinfo.library.unt.edu/npr/initiati/it/index.html">the</a> report ‚Äú <a href="https://govinfo.library.unt.edu/npr/library/announc/access/acessrpt.html">Modernization of state systems based on information technologies</a> ‚Äù was published.  It formed the main idea of ‚Äã‚Äãthe TG - the ministries were supposed to start using IT to increase the efficiency of interaction between citizens, business and the state.  Special attention in the report was given to the synergies of public services and technologies.  On the basis of these developments, a ‚Äú <a href="https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/PPP-1999-book2/pdf/PPP-1999-book2-doc-pg2317.pdf">Memorandum on a digital state</a> ‚Äù was formed.  It was addressed to the heads of executive bodies and departments, who later joined the work. <br><br>  The memorandum set forth a number of guiding principles for the TF concept.  One of the basic principles was to work with information and ordered to organize it not by individual departments, but by categories of services.  The second principle is openness and convenience of interaction of citizens with state organizations and the provision of information in a clear form.  The third is the security and privacy of such an interaction. <br><br>  In December 1999, the Clinton administration <a href="http://unpan1.un.org/intradoc/groups/public/documents/un-dpadm/unpan043654.pdf">made the</a> first attempts to introduce digital state systems across the country.  By 2000, already 43% of Americans <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_in_the_United_States%25252523Access_and_speed">were provided with</a> access to the Internet, so the situation was conducive to the realization of the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãa public digital portal of public services.  It was launched in 2000 on the FirstGov.gov domain, now renamed to USA.gov. <br><br>  In 2001, George Bush replaced Bill Clinton as president of the United States.  His presidential program contained the development of the TG concept: ‚ÄúThe <a href="https://georgewbush-whitehouse.archives.gov/infocus/technology/tech4.html">Expanded Digital State</a> ‚Äù provided for the need to improve IT in the public sector, simplify business processes and integrate information flows from various government ministries and departments. <br><br>  To achieve these objectives, in 2002 an ad hoc working group was established.  She <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/whitehouse.gov/files/omb/assets/OMB/inforeg/egovstrategy.pdf">chose</a> 24 initiatives and prepared a business case for each of them, assessing potential costs, benefits, and risks.  Among them were services such as E-Authentication (digital signature portal);  GovBenefits.gov (government benefits portal);  Business Gateway (business portal). <br><br>  The adoption of the ‚Äú <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E-Government_Act_of_2002">Law on the digital state</a> ‚Äù in 2002 became the central event in the process of expanding the systems of the TG.  Its provisions established a special department in the Administrative and Budgetary Administration and encouraged the use of IT in the provision of public services and interdepartmental communications. <br><br>  In 2003, <a href="http://unpan1.un.org/intradoc/groups/public/documents/un/unpan032372.pdf">an</a> updated digital state strategy <a href="http://unpan1.un.org/intradoc/groups/public/documents/un/unpan032372.pdf">was published</a> .  She put the interests of citizens at the center of attention - in the document there were such phrases as, for example, ‚Äúaccess in three clicks‚Äù. <br><br>  Other significant ideas related to inter-departmental communication, attracting and retaining qualified labor to support all IT initiatives.  During the year, with the publication of the law, portals such as volunteer.gov (to coordinate volunteer groups) and regulations.gov (to publish official documents of state bodies) were launched. <br><br>  The strategy also touched on recommendations for working with the government enterprise information architecture (Federal Enterprise Architecture Framework).  The first version of the best practices <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_enterprise_architecture%25252523History">was launched</a> in 1999.  It is based on the <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%259C%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B4%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BB%25D1%258C_%25D0%2597%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BA%25D0%25BC%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B0">Zakman Model</a> . <br><br>  The main task is to increase the efficiency of the work of ministries and departments.  The 2003 digital state strategy emphasized the role of this set of best practices.  It became one of the first options for an integrated approach to centralize and integrate information services. <br><br>  <a href="https://publicadministration.un.org/egovkb/portals/egovkb/Documents/un/2004-Survey/Complete-Survey.pdf">A</a> 2004 <a href="https://publicadministration.un.org/egovkb/portals/egovkb/Documents/un/2004-Survey/Complete-Survey.pdf">study</a> by the American Association of Public Administration and the United Nations confirmed that all the efforts of the US government were not in vain - the country was ahead of the rest of the UN member states in the development of TG systems. <br><br>  However, in most cases, citizens still had to either by telephone or in person to apply for state services.  The problem also lay in the fact that electronic forms often had to be supplemented with paper statements with a signature, and in some states there was simply no access to any electronic public services.  There was a situation when there was all the necessary infrastructure, legislation and strategy, but there was no uniform format for the work of the TF systems.  With these authorities had to figure out the following years. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/3y/y7/bq/3yy7bq_mlbxaa3288-o7fvnujqu.jpeg"><br>  <font color="#A9A9A9"><i>/ Flickr / <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/zuk0/15252002324/">tony</a> / <a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/2.0/">cc</a></i></font> <br><br><h2>  Asian digital state </h2><br>  Not only the US authorities were concerned about the transition to a new level of government and public services.  Along with Western countries with a high level of Internet penetration, Asian states are also among the leaders. <br><br>  So, Singapore has achieved great success on the road to building a digital state.  Already in the 80s, the country launched a national plan for "computerization".  Within its framework the National Computer Council (NCB) was created.  One of the important areas of his work was the computerization of public services.  At the initial stages, the council was engaged in the automation of work functions and document circulation in government institutions. <br><br>  In 1989, TradeNet was launched - a portal that served as a single platform for trade and logistics operations.  By the year 2000, <a href="http://choo.fis.utoronto.ca/fis/respub/it2000.html">an IT2000 Masterplan strategy was</a> formed in the country.  A significant part of it is devoted to the consolidation of IT resources around the solution of problems of citizens of the country.  As a result, the ‚ÄúAction Plan for the introduction of the TG concept‚Äù for 2000-2003 was proposed.  His main message is that government departments no longer need to be isolated from each other and provide comprehensive services. <br><br>  For example, since 2003, all Singaporeans aged 15 and over can apply for a <a href="https://www.quora.com/What-is-SingPass">SingPass</a> , a digital identity card, for transactions with a government online services portal. <br><br>  China and South Korea had their own programs for creating a digital state.  But we will focus on Japan, which today is among the leaders in the field of digitalization of public services.  In the period from 1999 to 2005, the Japanese government proposed several directions for the development of the TG: <a href="https://japan.kantei.go.jp/it/it_basiclaw/it_basiclaw.html">Basic principles of a</a> society based on information and communication;  <a href="http://unpan1.un.org/intradoc/groups/public/documents/apcity/unpan044343~1.pdf">The law</a> governing these principles;  the <a href="https://japan.kantei.go.jp/it/network/priority-all/index.html">e-Japan</a> program, which integrates all the measures to build a digital society;  and, finally, the <a href="http://www.e-gov.go.jp/en/pdf/en/promotion_plan.pdf">program</a> itself for the construction of the TG. <br><br>  Already in 1997, a single information platform was launched in the country, which brought together ministries and departments - <a href="http://unpan1.un.org/intradoc/groups/public/documents/apcity/unpan002417.pdf">WAN Kasumigaseki</a> .  An important step for the dissemination of the TG concept was the <a href="http://www.mofa.go.jp/policy/economy/summit/2000/documents/charter.html">adoption</a> in 2000 of the Charter of the Global Information Society.  The main idea was that the benefits of this society should be available to all people.  The document was proposed for signing by the members of the G8.  Russia has become one of the signatories of the Charter. <br><br><h2>  The birth of a digital state in Russia </h2><br>  Even before the signing of the Charter, attempts were made in Russia to digitize the public sector, for example, the creation of a ‚Äú <a href="http://www.iis.ru/library/sip/sip.ru.html">Concept of State Information Policy</a> ‚Äù.  By 1998, it was prepared by the relevant committee of the State Duma.  The concept traces the analogy with other documents of the time created in the United States.  The interests of society were in priority, and IT served as a tool for their maintenance. <br><br>  The conceptual continuation of the concept was the federal program " <a href="http://www.iis.ru/library/isp2010/isp2010.ru.html">The development of informatization in Russia for the period up to 2010</a> ".  She addressed both practical issues such as the formation of infrastructure, and the socio-economic and moral aspects of working with IT at the state level, respecting cultural and historical traditions, values ‚Äã‚Äãand ideals.  The document was never approved.  Thus, Russia came to the signing of the Charter of the Global Information Society without a valid plan or project of a digital state.  Nevertheless, like the other members of the G8, the country has committed itself to developing the IT sector for the benefit of society. <br><br>  Specific measures were taken with the launch of the federal program "Electronic Russia".  It was launched in 2002, but its implementation <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E-Government_in_Russia">was complicated by the</a> fact that only 19% of government personnel and 1% of government officials had access to the Network.  The situation was reflected in the indices of readiness for a digital state - for ten years, Russia was not able to move further than 50th place.  In 2003, among the leaders <a href="https://publicadministration.un.org/egovkb/portals/egovkb/Documents/un/2003-Survey/unpan016066.pdf">were the</a> United States, Chile, Australia, Mexico and the United Kingdom.  In <a href="https://publicadministration.un.org/egovkb/Portals/egovkb/Documents/un/2005-Survey/Complete-survey.pdf">2005</a> - the United States, Denmark, Sweden, United Kingdom, South Korea.  Russia was located between Uruguay and the Republic of Belarus. <br><br>  However, already in 2003, <a href="http://russoft.org/docs/%3Fdoc%3D524">a</a> project was <a href="http://russoft.org/docs/%3Fdoc%3D524">launched</a> in Russia for large-scale implementation of information technologies in federal departments.  According to Leonid Reiman, who was at that time the minister of information technology and communications, about 80% of departments and ministries switched to electronic document circulation in the early 2000s.  However, summing up the program, the ministry <a href="http://www.cnews.ru/reviews/free/gov2011/articles/article2.shtml">was forced to state</a> disappointing results.  Electronic Russia did not achieve its goals, but, as Leonid Reiman later <a href="http://www.comnews.ru/node/50469">said</a> , laid important foundations for the development of TG systems in Russia. <br><br>  About how the development of the TG continued in our country and in other countries, we will tell in the next part. <br><br><h5>  A few more posts from the corporate blog 1cloud: </h5><br><ul><li>  <a href="https://1cloud.ru/blog/udalennyj-dostup-k-kompyuteru-s-pomoshchyu-vdi%3Futm_source%3Dhabrahabr%26utm_medium%3Dcpm%26utm_campaign%3Dbusiness-laws%26utm_content%3Dblog">Virtual tables and windows: about the types of provision of a remote resource</a> </li><li>  <a href="https://1cloud.ru/blog/komputerny-class-v-oblake%3Futm_source%3Dhabrahabr%26utm_medium%3Dcpm%26utm_campaign%3Dbusiness-laws%26utm_content%3Dblog">Computer class in the cloud: advantages and opportunities</a> </li><li>  <a href="https://1cloud.ru/blog/obektnoe-hranilishe%3Futm_source%3Dhabrahabr%26utm_medium%3Dcpm%26utm_campaign%3Dbusiness-laws%26utm_content%3Dblog">Why do you need object storage for files in the cloud</a> </li><li> <a href="https://1cloud.ru/blog/raid-massiv-v-virtualynoy-mashine%3Futm_source%3Dhabrahabr%26utm_medium%3Dcpm%26utm_campaign%3Dbusiness-laws%26utm_content%3Dblog">Why RAID arrays for virtual machines</a> </li></ul></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/351362/">https://habr.com/ru/post/351362/</a></p>
