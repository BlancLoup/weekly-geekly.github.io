  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Rival google gets closer to your dream</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  The search startup Powerset, <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2007/02/09/powerset-hype-to-boiling-point/">as it became known</a> today, received a license to use the technologies developed at the Palo Alto Research Center (PARC).  A Google competitor has become a little closer to his dream. <br><br>  About Powerset, it became known <a href="http://www.habrahabr.ru/translation/988/">not so long ago</a> , but she managed to make some noise in the Internet get-together with her intentions to contend with the leader of the search market - Google.  The main advantage of the future search engine developers themselves believe that he will understand the normal human language.  They scold Google for the fact that various prepositions and conjunctions are not significant for it: for example, ‚Äúbooks for children‚Äù, ‚Äúbooks written by children‚Äù (‚Äúbooks by children‚Äù) and ‚Äúbooks about children "(" Book about children ") - these three phrases for current search engines are equivalent. <br><br>  Powerset and PARC entered into an agreement according to which an ambitious company receives the right to use the technology of "natural language", which will become the basis of the search engine.  The technology so far ‚Äúcopes‚Äù only with English, French and some other European languages.

      The financial side of the transaction has not been disclosed;  all we know now is 2 indicators: $ 12.5 million (received so much Powerset during the first round of investments) and 30 years (spent so much on technology development).  It is also known that PARC will receive royalties for its use and a share in the Powerset.  PARC President Mark Bernstein <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2007/02/09/technology/09license.html%3Fex%3D1328677200%26en%3Da6eecf6476deeef3%26ei%3D5088">says</a> that this is one of the largest agreements in the history of the Center. <br><br>  Pal Alto Research Center is an organization with a long history.  At the beginning of the XXI century, Xerox decided to get rid of the "non-core asset", which it simply could not contain.  In 2002, the Center was separated from the company structure.  In his new form, he was able not only to retain the title of one of the leading US research centers, but also to establish effective cooperation with both scientific organizations and commercial companies.  More than half of PARC's research is still funded by Xerox, but the Center collaborates with Fujitsu, Dai Nippon Printing, and others. PARC's research areas are diverse: for example, a technology is being developed in conjunction with the Scripps Research Institute (San Diego) that will detect cancer early stages with the help of a laser, which is now used in printers, and together with SolFocus we are working on technologies for using solar energy. <br><br>  In Silicon Valley and beyond, PARC is called the ‚Äúlaboratory of lost opportunities‚Äù: it was there that work was done on the graphical user interface and Ethernet, but these developments were ‚Äúcommercialized‚Äù by others. <br><br>  Experts ambiguously assess the prospects for cooperation between PARC and Powerset.  For example, Fernando Pereira, a professor at the University of Pennsylvania, says that this technology is certainly progressive and interesting, but its acquisition does not guarantee the Powerset to win the race with Google.  It is not known how long it will take to bring the new search engine "to the mind", although the developers say about the end of 2007 as the planned date for its official submission.  But it is clearly known that any technology is not immune from errors. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/5037/">https://habr.com/ru/post/5037/</a></p>
