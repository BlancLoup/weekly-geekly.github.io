Dozens of brands and hundreds of goods pass through our hands, which means that interesting observations accumulate that we want to share. <br><br> <a href="https://geektimes.ru/company/mvideo/blog/286484/"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/53f/d05/675/53fd056759aef2ad3a2e0f74a1a2ecfc.jpg"></a> <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  The spring that has begun gradually awakens the thoughts of a long-awaited summer vacation.  And there are always those who do not want to wait a few more months and are ready to fly in the heat and the sun - to reclaim or just bask on the beach. <br><br>  And vacation is another great reason to upgrade your gadget fleet.  On a vacation trip, a whole set of portable devices are required: a camera, a smartphone, a tablet, a power bank and various travel accessories.  But we will postpone the underwater and panoramic cameras and other devices for outdoor activities until the next time.  This material will only gadgets for a relaxing holiday, with loads not higher than swimming in the beach area.

    <h2>  <font color="#ec2028">Camera</font> </h2><br>  Photos and videos - the main thing that we bring from vacation.  As they say, did not post it - it does not count.  But if for instagram of especially high quality photos are not needed, then for printed pictures you need professional quality.  Love paper photos or view videos and photos on a high-resolution screen - it‚Äôs better not to restrict your camera phone.  Take a camera with you. <br><br>  We will not consider professional cameras, experts do not need our recommendations.  We will consider the most interesting small-sized cameras (the so-called digital compact cameras) capable of providing high quality images, but designed for a simple user who is not grounded in theory and may not even know such words as shutter speed, aperture and exposure.  I set the mode, pressed the button, got a great photo.  And before you say that the "soapbox" out of fashion, imagine how your favorite Xiaomi, Huawei, or maybe the iPhone fall into a puddle on the waterfront or carefully buried in the sand by your child. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/e30/452/c82/e30452c82d2c70a6b4b2a67b2616bdde.png"><br><br><h3>  <a href="http://www.mvideo.ru/products/fotoapparat-kompaktnyi-nikon-coolpix-w100-blue-backpack-kit-10010822">Nikon Coolpix W100</a> - Hardy Family Vacation Camera </h3><br>  One of the most suitable options for lovers of moderately active holidays with children.  The Nikon Coolpix W100 has a very decent protection: this camera can withstand drops from a height of 1.8 m, immersion to a depth of 10 m (up to one hour), impermeable to dust and even resistant to cold to -10 degrees.  If you want to climb the mountains, get out to sea fishing for a few hours, or give your frisky children a walk, you should not worry about the safety of the camera.  You can even throw her in the sand on the beach.  In terms of protection, the Nikon Coolpix W100 is confidently committed to the standards of some action cameras. <br><br>  For a Nikon Coolpix W100 protected amateur camera, it has good photo quality.  The camera matrix is ‚Äã‚Äãa CMOS 1/3 "with a resolution of 13 megapixels, the ISO sensitivity is adjustable from 125 to 1600 units. The lens - with a triple optical zoom, 4.1-12.3 mm, 30-90 mm in 35-millimeter equivalent. The camera has a good clear menu with presets and manual shooting, it also has such rare options as portrait underwater photography and a children's menu. As a child's toy, the Nikon Coolpix W100 is very useful for its high overall stress tolerance. <br><br>  Other protected CTF: <br><table><tbody><tr><td>  <a href="http://www.mvideo.ru/products/fotoapparat-kompaktnyi-fujifilm-finepix-xp90-orange-10009525">Fujifilm FinePix XP90</a> <br><br></td><td>  12490 rub <br></td><td>  CMOS 16MP, 1 / 2.3 " <br>  Optics 28-140mm, F: 3.9-4.9 <br></td></tr><tr><td>  <a href="http://www.mvideo.ru/products/fotoapparat-kompaktnyi-panasonic-lumix-dmc-ft30-blue-10008218">Panasonic Lumix DMC-FT30</a> <br></td><td>  12990 rub <br></td><td>  CMOS 16.1 megapixels, 1 / 2.33 " <br>  Optics 4,5-18mm, F: 2.0-4.9 <br></td></tr><tr><td>  <a href="http://www.mvideo.ru/products/fotoapparat-kompaktnyi-olympus-tg-3-macro-light-kit-red-10007297">Olympus TG-3 Macro Light</a> <br><br></td><td>  17990 rub <br></td><td>  CMOS 16MP, 1 / 2.3 " <br>  Optics 4,5-18mm, F: 3.9-5.7 <br></td></tr><tr><td>  <a href="http://www.mvideo.ru/products/fotoapparat-kompaktnyi-olympus-tg-870-white-10010581">Olympus TG-870</a> <br></td><td>  22990 rub <br></td><td>  CMOS 16MP, 1 / 2.3 " <br>  Optics 3.74-18.7mm, F: 3.5-5.7 <br></td></tr></tbody></table><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/6e6/1fa/a57/6e61faa573816c6e2b46a1611f5b07a0.jpg"><br><br><h3>  <a href="http://www.mvideo.ru/products/fotoapparat-kompaktnyi-sony-cyber-shot-dsc-hx300-black-10004410">Sony Cybershot DSC HX300</a> - the most popular ultrazoom </h3><br>  There are not so few interesting digital camera cameras in our range, and the Sony Cybershot DSC HX300 is the most popular among them.  There is a reason for this - the awe-inspiring quality of photographs resulting from its high technical characteristics. <br><br>  Matrix Sony Cybershot DSC HX300 has a physical size of 1 / 2.3 inches and a resolution of 20.4 megapixels, which is quite good!  The camera lens is a real telephoto with a 50x optical zoom!  The range of focal lengths is from 24 to 1200 mm with luminous f / 2.8-6.3.  Also, the camera is equipped with an image stabilizer that can work in two modes, as well as shoot Full HD video at a speed of 50 frames per second.  All this allows you to get great photos and videos of moving objects, and the distance to the subject can be very large.  Ordinary memorable frames, panoramic and portrait, for the Sony Cybershot DSC HX300, the more not a problem. <br><br>  With characteristics worthy of a professional camera, this is still an amateur camera: the Sony Cybershot DSC HX300 has a large number of presets and subject programs for people who don‚Äôt want to delve into the technical aspects of photography.  However, those who want to learn the basics of photography will not be deprived: the camera is capable of shooting in manual mode. <br><br>  Other amateur ultrazoom: <br><table><tbody><tr><td>  <a href="http://www.mvideo.ru/products/fotoapparat-kompaktnyi-canon-powershot-sx410-is-black-10007705">Canon PowerShot SX410 IS</a> <br></td><td>  11990 <br></td><td>  CMOS 20 MP, 1 / 2.3 " <br>  Optics 4.3-172mm, F: 3.4-5.8 <br></td></tr><tr><td>  <a href="http://www.mvideo.ru/products/fotoapparat-kompaktnyi-nikon-coolpix-s7000-black-10007637">Nikon Coolpix S7000</a> <br></td><td>  12990 <br></td><td>  CMOS 16MP, 1 / 2.3 " <br>  Optics 4.5-90mm, F: 3.4-6.5 <br></td></tr><tr><td>  <a href="http://www.mvideo.ru/products/fotoapparat-kompaktnyi-canon-powershot-sx610hs-black-10007484">Canon PowerShot SX610HS</a> <br></td><td>  17990 <br></td><td>  CMOS 18 megapixels, 1 / 2.3 " <br>  Optics 4.3-86mm, F: 3.5-6.5 <br></td></tr><tr><td>  <a href="http://www.mvideo.ru/products/fotoapparat-kompaktnyi-panasonic-lumix-dmc-tz57-black-10008219/">Panasonic Lumix DMC-TZ57</a> <br></td><td>  19990 <br></td><td>  CMOS 16MP, 1 / 2.3 " <br>  Optics 4.3-86mm, F: 3.3-6.4 <br></td></tr></tbody></table><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/cd9/143/bc0/cd9143bc0bb3c120da6440fc187ee949.jpg"><br><br><h3>  <a href="http://www.mvideo.ru/products/fotoapparat-kompaktnyi-panasonic-lumix-dmc-fz300-10008976">Panasonic Lumix DMC FZ300</a> is the best buy </h3><br>  With its technical parameters, the Lumix DMC FZ300 resembles the super-popular Sony Cybershot DSC HX300: the matrix has the same physical size that determines the good quality of the pictures, and the lens here is also ultrazoom.  Therefore, we can say the same about the features of shooting and application: the owner of the Panasonic Lumix DMC FZ300 can add recordings of distant objects and dynamic frames to the usual ‚Äútourist‚Äù panoramic and portrait shots. <br><br>  However, there are some differences: the camera's zoom is somewhat smaller, it is 24-fold, and the matrix resolution is 12 megapixels.  At the same time, the Lumix DMC FZ300 is clearly aimed at lovers of video shooting: the camera is capable of making videos in 4K format (3840 x 2160 pixels), and the frame formats supported are 1920 x 1080, 1270 x 720 and 640 x 480 pixels - these modes can be useful for saving places on memory cards. <br><br>  All this is great, but this camera got into our hit parade not so much for high quality, but as a bargain.  Lumix DMC FZ300 falls under the share of ‚Äúsmart installments‚Äù 0-0-24 - zero percent mark-up and payment of the cost within 24 months.

Especially often this happens in roaming, on a long distant trip.  Here the smartphone finally turns into an onboard computer.  In such a situation, all its characteristics are important: performance, and versatile functionality, because full-fledged computers and laptops on a trip are most often not at hand. <br><br>  Only the gaming skills are questionable, everything else is needed: a powerful processor, maximum RAM and storage, 4G modem, Wi-Fi 802.11ac, GPS, good cameras, large capacity battery, high-resolution display and excellent color reproduction (believable or expressive, this is someone as you like), with durable, resistant to impact and scratches glass, and better even in a fully protected case ... In general, you need a perfect smartphone on a vacation trip. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/10b/411/9b6/10b4119b6dc23d6e8fcd96a46e6fdeba.jpg"><br><br><h3>  <a href="http://www.mvideo.ru/products/smartfon-samsung-galaxy-s7-edge-32gb-ds-sm-g935fd-black-onyx-30024653">Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge</a> - the best smartphone for a beautiful vacation </h3><br>  Of course, it‚Äôs not worth dropping it, but it‚Äôs more than enough for most requirements: a large battery, high-quality cameras and even protection from dust and splashes.  We are not even talking about the performance and quality of the screen. <br><br>  The only obvious disadvantage of the Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge is the price, which is quite natural for gadgets of this level.  In addition, the following model of this line will be released in April.

Although the protection of the Huawei Honor 8 is actually only the glass Gorilla Glass 3. But it carries on board as many as three cameras.  Two of them are 12-megapixel equipped with an optical system of six lenses and provide high-quality frames for photo and video.  If you are ready to be content with very good photos and videos from a smartphone and do not want to carry a separate camera with you, Huawei Honor 8 just asks in your hands. <br><br>  The advantages are worth adding an acceptable price tag, a very presentable design, a 3000 mAh battery and the ability to use a 128 GB microSD. <br><br>  In the same price category and with similar technical characteristics, our next hero, to whom we other in 2017 become a real hit. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/51b/721/689/51b7216895798fd0e57f543c167baa0f.jpg"><br><br><h3>  <a href="http://www.mvideo.ru/products/smartfon-samsung-galaxy-a5-2017-black-30027403">Samsung Galaxy A5 (2017)</a> - new, future hit, friend of the traveler </h3><br>  Last year's version of the Samsung Galaxy A5 has received recognition from a huge number of users.
