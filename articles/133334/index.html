The experience can not be called successful, the more interesting, and I hope my post will be more useful for novice developers. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  I just want to say that my professional activity is not related to software development, and I didn‚Äôt have programming experience for mobile platforms before iOS (except for writing simple Qt tools for Symbian). <br><br>  The actual acquaintance with iOS began with the acquisition of the iPhone.  And immediately wanted to write something for him.  Since I often come across IP addresses at work, it‚Äôs not so easy for me to compute something besides the number of hosts on the network with a given mask, and the IP calculator is not always at hand (IP); an idea arose to write a simple program that would output some useful information to the specified IP address and mask.  It is clear that the App Store already had a bunch of such applications.  However, after reviewing virtually the entire list (about 30 applications), I did not find one that I would like to use.  This strengthened me, and I firmly decided to write a fairly simple IP calculator with a strict / clean design.  Make sure I did it - you can <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/app/ip-calculator-ipv4/id476606425">here</a> .

    <img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/581acc45/ea7be90c/b684dd14/b83ee62b.jpg"><br><br>  For development, I used MacOS Snow Leopard (10.6).  In my opinion, for people who have only Windows OS (and not having a mac) it is easiest to use MacOS on a virtual machine.  I do not understand what caused the dispute "Macintosh vs.  Hakintosh ‚Äù, when you can‚Äú one-click ‚Äùto start working with MacOS having a Windows host OS.  It seems to me that for beginners (and not only) developers this is the best option. <br><br>  I got used to the Objective-C language and the development environment very quickly.  This helped me two books.  <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Beginning-iPhone-Development-Exploring-iOS/dp/143023024X/">The first</a> (‚ÄúBeginning iPhone 4 Development: Exploring the iOS SDK‚Äù by David Mark, Jack Nutting &amp; Jeff LaMarche) is very simple, in which everything is literally chewed.  <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Programming-Objective-C-2-0-Stephen-Kochan/dp/0321566157">The second</a> (‚ÄúProgramming in Objective-C 2.0‚Äù, Stephen G. Kochan) is much more interesting, and, in my opinion, even in some sense fundamental.  Special attention is given to the issue of memory management.  I recommend to novice developers, first of all, to get acquainted with this topic (all attention to the lifetime of objects and retain / release!) And the Leaks tool in XCode. <br><br>  In terms of development, I did not encounter any difficulties, except for the lack of the possibility of using some classes when programming for older versions of iOS (3. *).  In particular, this concerns gestures (UI ... GestureRecognizer) and regular expressions (NSRegularExpression).  Judging by the App Strore, many developers, not too zealous, indicate in the form of a minimum version of iOS 4.0 or even 5.0 (!).  Perhaps they are right, and not many devices with old iOS, but I did not see statistics, so I do not want to rely only on new versions of iOS. <br><br>  If anyone is interested, the problem with the lack of GestureRecognizer can be solved <a href="http://www.cocoanetics.com/2010/08/taphold-for-tableview-cells-then-and-now/">like this</a> , and with the absence of the NSRegularExpression <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2265262/nspredicate-usage">like that</a> . <br><br>  Those who want to figure out how to implement a pop-up menu, similar to what is used in the iPhone's address book to copy contact numbers, <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2487844/simple-way-to-show-the-copy-popup-on-uitableviewcells-like-the-address-book-ap">this</a> article is useful. <br><br>  The process of purchasing a license and placing the program in the App Store is quite simple to understand (the only thing that needs attention is filling out Bank Info in iTunes Connect, I advise you to contact the bank, if you have any questions or doubts save time).  By the time: 7 days passed from the moment of sending the fax to the moment of receiving the developer license, from the moment of downloading the program to iTunes Connect, 6 days passed from the moment of its acceptance and placement in the App Store (taken the first time). <br><br>  The dynamics of purchases, you can appreciate the screenshot below.  The program for some time kept in the first six (it occupied 3, 5, 6 places), then dropped out of this six and ceased to be bought by someone. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/a0d22179/fea27b5b/23c8c3dc/754ae8fe.gif"><br><br>  A total of 17 purchases were made, the distribution by country is as follows: <br><ul><li>  USA - 7 </li><li>  France - 3 </li><li>  Russia - 3 </li><li>  Austria - 1 </li><li>  Italy - 1 </li><li>  Japan - 1 </li><li>  Niger - 1 </li></ul>  I will note one subtlety - it is extremely necessary to approach the tags that you specify when you post a program, especially to abbreviated forms of words.  Do not expect that by specifying the word ‚Äúautomobile‚Äù as a tag, your program will be issued in iTunes on the request ‚Äúauto‚Äù.  A search in it is stupid enough to understand that these may be synonymous. <br><br>  I consider my first experience in developing for iOS to be satisfactory, there is no positive result, but also a negative one.  I will be glad to comments / advice / comments / questions. <br><br>  <b>UPD</b> Thanks to <b>Infernal</b> for <a href="http://goo.gl/crp3s">statistics</a> on the versions used by iOS. <br><br>  <b>I do not urge to violate copyright and use for the development of Mac OS belonging to other people (violating, by the way, the license agreement).</b>  <b>A trial version of Mac OS (valid for 31 days, for example) could solve this problem.</b> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/133334/">https://habr.com/ru/post/133334/</a></p>
