Mobile home miostimulyatory, which also includes PowerDot, are designed strictly to perform certain simple tasks.  Most often, among the effects of myostimulation called:

    <ul><li>  Improved microcirculation and detoxification of the body </li><li>  Fight against excess body fat </li><li>  Stimulate the release of endorphins through active muscle contraction </li><li>  Muscle relaxation </li><li>  Improving athletic performance: endurance, strength, muscle elasticity </li></ul><br>  However, it should be noted here that some effects are impossible only with the use of gadgets, for example, giving a certain shape to a figure is impossible only by applying electrodes. <br><br>  Athletes use the miostimulyator as a means to quickly restore and improve physical performance.  Some more Soviet studies showed the results of tests, according to which the strength and endurance of athletes increased by 40%. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/4s/bc/be/4sbcbeqjlqv5cyxpknmmnv6pgv8.jpeg"><br><br>  However, not all miostimulators are convenient to use, although it would seem that taking a device with you is quite logical.  One of these miostimulyatorov, mobile and compact, at one time became PowerDot, and the new sports season, he has changed, it has become more convenient. <br><br>  <b>Powerdot</b> <br><br>  PowerDot's main competitive advantage is mobility.  Given that the box is very impressive, which initially leads to some misconception, the gadget itself is unusually small and light. <br><br>  Powered by PowerDot paired with a proprietary application that has become clearer, more convenient and more logical.  And for the most part already localized for Russia.  The main section with stimulation modes is presented in three menus. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/3n/p3/uz/3np3uzop_bigtpagwechmnkig1u.jpeg"><br><br>  The first presents daily and functional training.  In the second section, all these courses are further divided into groups of muscles that you plan to stimulate: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/qi/f1/yt/qif1ytaciqg-dtg4evajgq0woe0.jpeg"><br><br>  And, finally, the last (while the English-speaking section), the simplest section is a section with massage modes not for muscle groups, but for parts of the body.  Each section is accompanied by a visual instruction on how to properly fix the electrodes. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/r4/fh/wv/r4fhwvmm861zugtktfz4g8wslyw.jpeg"><br><br>  PowerDot involves several steps of ‚Äúprotection‚Äù against illiterate use.  Already going into the application and connecting the gadget, you will need to properly fix and connect the electrodes to the leads.  Otherwise, the training simply will not start. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/hx/_c/2a/hx_c2adlvpvi_cy97wp1wetewwk.jpeg"><br><br>  Also, given that each workout is timed, with premature termination, the program of myostimulator will ask for additional confirmation of the stop.  And, of course, even at the very beginning, you will have to pass a small test of 22 questions and theses that need to be answered or the provisions of which are required to be confirmed. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/dl/gc/ai/dlgcaijk85qm1tsthfy3wpiv8py.jpeg"><br><br>  Firstly, it is important for your own safety!  Myostimulation as a method has enough contraindications, the most common of which are heart problems, oncology, pregnancy, open wounds, etc. Secondly, this should prevent incorrect use of the gadget in the absence of contraindications: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/c3/xf/dr/c3xfdrez3szm-q1zzzoqeppmbrk.jpeg"><br><br>  And finally, there are warnings not to use the gadget for other than its intended purpose.  It is known that electrical stimulation is common in the erotic sphere, however, there electricity is used a little differently, so we see here: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/6b/i_/_u/6bi__uguwka1ejuol3oswu3rm0s.png"><br><br>  In general, PowerDot provides enough information at each stage of the workout, accompanying from connection to completion, which makes it safe for the user.  It should be noted that starting a particular type of training or massage, by default you start it in ‚Äúzero mode‚Äù. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/ej/jh/21/ejjh21pur1tnd3alfkacyxlevbi.png"><br><br>  And then you optimize the power of stimulation and intensity, gradually increasing the power yourself! <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/oe/w4/6q/oew46qu_vk-q7cjtvf5pjugdiv4.gif"><br><br><blockquote>  A brief summary of the application: convenient and clear.  You just don‚Äôt have to think, but how to put it right, but there.  Successfully solved a phased flexible setting of the intensity, and so that 1-2-3-4 modes.  Plus, add that the application also saves statistics about the workouts, so that if something happens, do not overdo it. </blockquote><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/jl/wk/wv/jlwkwvz_rrbdgh1zo8hfwpkqqik.jpeg"><br><br>  <b>PowerDot itself has not changed much</b> <br><br>  However, there were two of them.  A ‚Äúdual model‚Äù of <a href="https://medgadgets.ru/shop/powerdot-duo.html%3Futm_source%3Dgeek%26utm_medium%3Dpowerdot%26utm_campaign%3Dpowerdotduo">PowerDot DUO was added</a> , which is completed with two miostimulators.  Let's say it is convenient for runners, cyclists, to simultaneously perform the procedure on both limbs. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/ol/lb/ly/ollblywfig-oewzgjhdo70qhsta.gif"><br><br>  However, let us return to the base model.  PowerDot UNO - a compact two-channel myostimulator. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/pi/er/ty/piertyd6nyhebxryutxvmij9yqo.jpeg"><br><br>  In total, you will find: <br><br><ul><li>  Plate with round electrodes </li><li>  Plates with rectangular electrodes </li><li>  Two wires for connecting electrodes (shorter and longer) </li><li>  Charging cable </li><li>  Miostimulyator PowerDot </li></ul><br>  All this can be stored in a special convenient bag-case. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/kz/kb/ak/kzkbak5_r_6nwekbjhd37yc2n04.jpeg"><br><br>  The gadget is small.  Reminds a small piece of soap. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/it/rv/rd/itrvrdtz0fkew7f5hje9dv625pw.jpeg"><br><br>  The size of the oval in length is about 6 cm. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/hb/n9/dr/hbn9drq5tukzllqe7qm7eiypfjc.jpeg"><br><br>  The gadget is equipped with a microUSB connector, which serves both for connecting the charging cable and for connecting electrodes. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/le/5l/d4/le5ld497_r7jy1v3znzk3amomsq.jpeg"><br><br>  Wires are presented in two sizes - shorter and shorter, which is dictated by individual workouts. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/jo/ky/dg/jokydgvccfto_mdct9tugccf3h8.jpeg"><br><br>  Round leads are attached to the ends of these wires. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/pl/cp/gb/plcpgbpjc35q8ifywmhi5btr2ou.jpeg"><br><br>  For a rectangular contact, the mount is located directly in the case of the myostimulator, from the side that is considered to be rear. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/ho/ei/_z/hoei_zdhvtemlzzxn_ko62_079e.jpeg"><br><br>  In assembled and connected form, all this is attached to the body and may look like this: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/8r/wi/ml/8rwimlzanew1mq1urynlrztaqj4.gif"><br><br>  There are, of course, more attachment points for PowerDot depending on which muscle groups you need to stimulate. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/yp/to/9f/ypto9ft6l2o4kldcdjecafcuyqm.jpeg"><br><br>  We also note that at present, the PowerDot miostimulator model is available in two colors: red and black. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/33/de/c1/33dec1zsqokmo342ecjfgjxq3tk.jpeg"><br><br>  With the updated version of the gadget, we got a slightly oversized contact plates. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/vq/wv/ho/vqwvhotnp5i-navedy_wsp_k794.jpeg"><br><br>  And rectangular: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/l5/nu/yp/l5nuypixuzxhkb3_dt6yfzcfguk.jpeg"><br><br>  And round: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/tl/kb/hg/tlkbhgoum2dtfy-8hfzq7ch3icc.jpeg"><br><br>  This provides better fixation, and covers a large area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe body. <br><br><blockquote>  As a small summary of the device: excellent and thoughtful equipment with additional consumables, convenient dimensions and simple on / off with a single button - nothing superfluous on the case.  PowerDot is truly compact and mobile. </blockquote><br>  From the main declared features of a specific model, we additionally list: <br><br><ul><li>  Improving overall athletic performance </li><li>  Enhance endurance, elasticity, strength and speed of <i>14 major</i> muscle groups </li><li>  Improving muscular aesthetics and tone </li><li>  Muscle recovery in a more efficient and faster way. </li><li>  Muscle relaxation through massage, relieving tension and improving blood circulation </li></ul><br>  PowerDot - the gadget is not cheap.  However, our store in conjunction with the official supplier to the beginning of the season offers to use a coupon for a 15% discount on this model of a miostimulyator - <a href="https://medgadgets.ru/shop/power-dot-jelektricheskij-stimuljator-myshc.html%3Futm_source%3Dgeek%26utm_medium%3Dpowerdot%26utm_campaign%3Dpowerdot">PowerDot UNO</a> .  Coupon <b>GEEKDOT</b> is valid when you pay the order on the website <br><br>  On closer inspection, the PowerDot design seems beneficial.  Here it must be said that the idea with universal leads is opposed to local miostimulators, which may cost less, but are intended for certain parts of the body.  Such models are in well-known brands Beurer, Slendertone. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/9x/ti/kb/9xtikb2ew5kes64uisbqrha_r78.jpeg"><br><br>  The cost of Slendertone on average - from five thousand for the muscles of the hands and from eight thousand for the press.  In other words, at a particular moment you save, but in the future you will overpay for the ‚Äúassembly‚Äù of the kit.  At the same time, if we are talking about parameters such as mobility, compactness, then the aesthetic component is clearly inferior. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/en/2t/ap/en2tap92ol31rnuim0-bnchg_1g.jpeg"><br><br>  Household miostimulyatory with leads, which are recognized as more universal, special compactness also do not differ.  The cost of some models, depending on the "promote" and brand name, can reach tens of thousands of rubles. <br><br>  In this case, Slendertone is not an indicator - there ordinary pulse massagers for the press cost about 8 - 12 thousand rubles, but if you assemble a set from Beurer, then press (about 4000) + kneecap (about 3000) + triceps (about . 3000) = draws an amount close to the current cost of a convenient and compact <a href="https://medgadgets.ru/shop/power-dot-jelektricheskij-stimuljator-myshc.html%3Futm_source%3Dgeek%26utm_medium%3Dpowerdot%26utm_campaign%3Dpowerdot">PowerDot</a> . </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/410841/">https://habr.com/ru/post/410841/</a></p>
