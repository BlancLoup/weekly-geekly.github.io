  <section class="page js-page"><h1>It seemed</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"> The director rustled the papers silently, as if looking for something.  Sergey stared blankly at him, slightly narrowing his eyes, and thought only that this meaningless conversation should end quickly.  The strange tradition of interviewing at dismissal was invented by Eychary, having observed such a technique in a particularly effective, in their opinion, company, within the framework of the current benchmarking.  The calculation has already been received, a few things - a mug, an expander and a rosary - have long been in the car.  It remained only to talk to the director.  What is he looking for there? <br><br>  Finally, the director's face lit up with a faint smile.  Apparently, he found what he was looking for - the name of the person with whom he was going to talk. <br><br>  - So, Sergey.  - folding his hands on the table, the director turned to the programmer.  ‚ÄúI won‚Äôt take much of your time.‚Äù  Actually, in your case, everything is clear.

      Sergey affirmatively nodded.  He did not understand what exactly was clear in his case, and what is not clear, but did not want to delve into the discussion, pick up old grievances and smear snot. <br><br>  - I will ask a standard question - what, in your opinion, can be improved in our company? <br><br>  - Nothing.  - Sergey shrugged his shoulders.  - In your company, everything is fine.  Good luck, happily stay, and so on. <br><br>  - Like in the song? <br><br>  - Like in the song.  - Sergey smiled, surprised by the director's knowledge of modern music. <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  - Oh well.  The director shrugged back.  - The reasons for the dismissal, like, nothing special is seen.  I confess that it‚Äôs not exactly in the course of your work - the IT director, Innokentiy, worked directly with me.  I know his work well, but I, in fact, heard about you only a few days ago.  When Kesha offered to fire you. <br><br>  Sergey involuntarily smiled.  An image immediately appeared in my head - Kesha, with a sad face, as he can, sighing heavily, as if tearing off a piece of heart, offers to dismiss the programmer.  The only programmer in the enterprise. <br><br>  - It is strange that you generally lasted so long with us. <br><br>  The director's face was serious, and, in the light of circumstances, it seemed somehow unrealistically cruel, like in a movie about a maniac or a murderer.  Sergey remembered a scene from the movie ‚ÄúAzazel‚Äù, where some special-purpose old man is going to kill Fandorin.  "It was a red face, and gruel will be red."  Calmly, without emotions, right in the face they say that Sergey, the programmer is a complete shit. <br><br>  - You almost did not participate in automation projects.  - continued the director. <br><br>  - Yeah.  - Sergey nodded. <br><br>  - All the programming tasks were performed by Kesha, despite his busy administrative work. <br><br>  - Yeah. <br><br>  - Ideas, thanks to which our company moved forward, was also proposed by him. <br><br>  - Yeah. <br><br>  - In crisis situations, when the company literally stood on the verge of death, Kesha was on the front line. <br><br>  - Yeah.  - Sergey nodded, but did not restrain himself, and smiled broadly. <br><br>  - What?  The director frowned. <br><br>  - Yes, so ... I remembered one case ... Please, continue, this does not apply to the topic. <br><br>  - I'm sure so.  - the director said seriously.  - Well, if you take purely professional achievements, then the quality ... So, where is this ... Ah, here!  You write govnokod! <br><br>  - Yeah ... What? <br><br>  Sergey's face was distorted by a vicious grimace.  He leaned forward, stared at the director so that he, just in case, slowly straightened up and clung to the back of the chair. <br><br>  - Govnokod?  - loudly asked Sergei.  - This is your Kesha said? <br><br>  - Well, in general ... It does not matter.  - the director tried to bring the conversation back on track.  - As we are already ... <br><br>  - Yes, ohrenet not important!  - continued to push Sergey.  - Your fucking venture with its retarded projects, crises and licking the director ass for me, let's say, on the drum.  But to assert that I am writing a shit, I will not allow it!  Especially - to freaks who have not written a single line of this very code in life! <br><br>  - Listen you ... - the director rose from his chair.  - Go away! <br><br>  - And go!  - Sergey also got up and moved to the exit, continuing to swear out loud.  - Well, your mother is something, and ... Govnokod!  I and govnokod!  How did he manage to deliver these two words to the sentence!  But how he managed to make a proposal at all!  I also covered this ass goat when he almost leaked the office! <br><br>  - Stop!  - There was a shout from the director when Sergey was already at the door. <br><br>  From unexpectedness, the programmer stopped.  He turned around - the director walked slowly towards, intensely peering into Sergey's face.  Damn ... I could leave and forget about this tent forever. <br><br>  - Sergey, give me another minute.  - the director said firmly, but then relented.  - You are welcome‚Ä¶ <br><br>  Sergey sighed heavily, trying not to look at the director.  It was a little embarrassing for my vzbryk, and I wanted to get away as soon as possible.  However, having decided that it was easier and faster to stay than to argue and try to escape, Sergey returned to the office. <br><br>  ‚ÄúYou can explain your phrase ...‚Äù the director began when the interlocutors returned to their seats. <br><br>  - Which one?  - Sergey perfectly understood what the director wants to hear about, but suddenly, by some miracle, he was interested in the govnokod. <br><br>  - You said something about ... How did you put it there ... <br><br>  - Kesha almost merged your office, and I covered his ass. <br><br>  - That's it ... Tell me more? <br><br>  - Okay.  - Sergey shrugged his shoulders, sensibly judging that the director has the right to know, and there is no need to keep the secret anymore.  - Remember the check? <br><br>  - What kind of check? <br><br>  - When unpleasant men in masks, camouflage and with machine guns at the ready broke into our office, rummaged in pieces of paper, dragged the server, took all the flash drives and put us on cancer? <br><br>  - Of course.  - smiled the director.  - This is hard to forget. <br><br>  - Well, you know the result - they did not find anything.  All that they ... Well, they could find ... It was located on the server they had collected.  However, they could not receive a single byte of data from the server, and returned it to its place. <br><br>  - Yes, I know this story very well.  - on the director's face ran a haughty shadow.  - Including, through its own channels, straight from ... It does not matter, in general.  What did you want to say?  About Kesh, I understand? <br><br>  - Yes, about Kesh.  - Sergey nodded and suddenly smiled.  - You just said that he played a role there, pulled us out of the crisis ... Is this related to the test? <br><br>  - Yes, I spoke about these events. <br><br>  - Do not tell me what you Kesha naped?  I'm really interested. <br><br>  - Sergey, I'm sorry, we are not playing children's games here.  - the director began to drill the programmer with a trained eye.  ‚ÄúYour version, my version ...‚Äù <br><br>  - Well, I went then?  - Sergey slowly rose from his chair and took a couple of steps towards the door. <br><br>  ‚ÄúWell, your mother ...‚Äù the director cursed.  - Well, what a clowning, eh? <br><br>  - Clowning ?!  - Sergey again flared up.  ‚ÄúNo, excuse me, which of us are being fired on false accusations?‚Äù  Yes, if contrived - sucked, and it would be okay from the finger!  It makes no difference to you - one more, one less, and what should I do now, huh?  Where can I find work in our village?  Clownery‚Ä¶ <br><br>  - Well, Sergey.  - the director conciliatory raised his hands.  - I beg your pardon.  Take a seat, please.  I will tell my version how you want it. <br><br>  Sergey, still aglow with indignation, returned to the chair and, with his tongue, stared at the table. <br><br>  - Innocent told me so.  - continued the director.  - When he saw that they came to us with a check, then, first of all, he rushed to the server room.  As I understand it, he needed to activate the data protection system, which he installed earlier, when ... Well, we learned that there is a possibility of verification.  He activated the system ... <br><br>  Sergey again snapped his tongue and somehow hopelessly smiled. <br><br>  - When he activated the system, then, as I understood, it was necessary to hide the security key that was on the flash drive.  Otherwise, if he hit the masked men, there would be no point in the protection system - they would get access to the data.  Considering on the go, Innocent realized that the best place for a flash drive - ask for petition, toilet.  And rushed there.  Apparently, he overdid it, attracted attention to himself, but still managed to reach the booth, and even close the door behind him.  Destroyed the flash drive, but the pursuers, realizing that Kesh was hiding something, broke down the toilet, dragged the IT director by the scruff, and inflicted light injuries along the way - which, by the way, was recorded in the emergency room, Kesha‚Äôs fingers were stripped in blood.  However, as these Herods did not try, nothing more could be achieved from our hero. <br><br>  - And now - the true story of the Red Cap.  - Sergey waited a long time for his turn to speak.  Let's start in order. <br><br>  Sergey sustained a small pause, forcing up the potential of interest in his person. <br><br>  - First, the defense was not established by Kesh, but by me.  This does not seem to be very important, but, in fact, determines all subsequent events.  I honestly tried to explain to him how it works, but he did not understand.  Therefore, I ... Mm-m ... I learned the stupidity of Keshi. <br><br>  - How exactly? <br><br>  - Do not interrupt, please, I will tell everything, otherwise I‚Äôll get it.  - Sergey continued.  - Secondly, in any server Kesha did not run.  You can check by cameras, by access control, as you like.  I am not sure that Kesha knows where the server room is and how it differs from the boiler room. <br><br>  - That is, how was not in the server?  - the director was genuinely surprised.  - No, well, though ... Well, let's say.  And the story with the toilet? <br><br>  - Oh, it's almost complete truth.  - Sergey smiled.  - And he ran fast, and the door was broken down, and minor injuries.  Only here ... He ran so fast that he locked himself in the toilet even before the masks came from the entrance to the office building.  You can ask Gena - he was in the toilet at that time, he was washing his hands, but he still didn‚Äôt know anything about checking.  If you remember, then the alarm button worked for us - the watchmen managed to press.  But Gene thought that we were just testing the warning system. <br><br>  The director nodded silently, continuing to gaze at Sergey and listen carefully. <br><br>  - Kesh sat in the toilet almost all the time checking.  - the programmer continued, already obviously enjoying both history and himself.  - As long as these gentlemen with machine guns did not want the hedgehogs to call. <br><br>  - What? <br><br>  - Well, in the toilet, in a small way.  Although, I do not know, maybe send the parcel ... It does not matter.  In short, they came to the toilet, pulled all the doors - apparently out of habit.  Here bang - one does not open.  Suspected wrong.  And Kesh, not from a big mind, when he closed, broke down the handle - specifically, such as not a working booth.  So he, in fact, received his mild injuries, that is to say torn fingers.  The guys, without hesitation, took out the door - it is flimsy, and they have strong foreheads.  Well dragged Kesh. <br><br>  The director did not look so carefully.  His gaze shifted from Sergey to his own table. <br><br>  - So, here the fun begins.  The flash drive was at Kesha, and he immediately gave it away.  Introduced, they say IT director, all that, I‚Äôm ready to cooperate, here‚Äôs the key to protect against the server, please fix it in the protocol.  Those with joy almost kissed him, led him to the server room, where Kesha was solemnly taken aback - he was asked to show which server he was protecting from.  Without thinking twice, I poked at the most hefty.  Guys sniffed - even they knew that it wasn‚Äôt a server, but an uninterruptible power supply that takes up half the rack.  Somehow, with grief in half, they found the same thing, which they had to withdraw from us, and left home. <br><br>  - Wait a minute ... - the director suddenly became a little paler.  - It turns out ... After all, they said that they did not find anything ... But in fact - what did they find?  We, therefore, have to wait ... <br><br>  - Nothing to wait.  - Sergey smiled.  - As I said, Kesha - stupid.  When I put the defense, I took it into account.  I gave him a flash drive with some kind of left key - I don‚Äôt already remember what software ... In short, just a text file with an abracadabra.  And, just in case, also damaged the flash drive, physically.  I don‚Äôt know for sure, but suppose that when they couldn‚Äôt turn on the server, they thought it was a bat flash drive.  Probably, they have pride, so they decided to pretend that they did not find anything.  They just could not turn on the server. <br><br>  - Are you sure about this, Sergey?  The director asked hopefully. <br><br>  - Of course.  - as seriously as possible, the programmer answered.  - Everything is simple there.  To turn on the server, you need a flash drive.  Normal, which I have in the country lies.  If you turn on without a flash drive, then physically, of course, it will start, but the system will not start, and it is impossible to get data from the disks, they are encrypted.  Turned off the server - you can‚Äôt turn it on without a flash drive. <br><br>  - That is, if we turn off the electricity ... <br><br>  - then everything will be fine.  - Sergey smiled.  - I bought a bespereboynik ... So you bought it - very good.  Just enough to drive to my cottage and back.  Well, if the server really crashes - anything can happen - well ... No flash drive will help here, to lift it equally long. <br><br>  - And if they, for example, did not begin to take away the server?  - asked the director.  - Did you just copy the data from it without turning it off? <br><br>  - There is such a possibility.  - Sergey nodded.  ‚ÄúBut if we remember, in preparation for the test, we monitored the practice for a long time.‚Äù  They do not like to mess around, prefer to take with them.  In the end, programmers and administrators have much less of them than these ironborn who knock the door open with their heads, not always theirs.  At each departure will not take with you.  And programmers like to work in their cave, they are afraid of daylight like worms.  Well, in the end, it would be necessary to copy terabytes, but on some USB, it will remain without lunch.  In short, considering all the risks, they decided to do as they did.  Well, not lost. <br><br>  - Once again, Sergey ... - the director became thoughtful.  - I do not understand why you gave Innocent flash drive? <br><br>  - He knew that he would give it away.  Well, man like that. <br><br>  - And you - not so? <br><br>  - I do not know, to be honest.  - Sergey shrugged his shoulders.  ‚ÄúI'm not a hero, but ... Well, I won't fantasize.‚Äù  I knew that Kesh would give it away, so I used it. <br><br>  - Used? <br><br>  - Well.  These guys would not leave without the certainty that they took something valuable.  And what could be more valuable than a secret flash drive, obtained from the CIO, who is hiding in the toilet? <br><br>  - Well, in general, perhaps ... And, hell, I do not know ... Tell me, please, Sergey - they didn't copy the data for sure? <br><br>  - Right.  You can call any hackers, turn off the server, and ask them to download at least something.  Well, to be sure. <br><br>  ‚ÄúNo, no, don't ...‚Äù the director shook his head uncertainly.  - I try to believe people.  Perhaps I am not always right in this. <br><br>  - That's for sure.  - Sergey smiled. <br><br>  - In terms of? <br><br>  ‚ÄúAh ... no, it's okay.‚Äù  I had Kesha in mind. <br><br>  - Yes, Kesha ... What to do now ... On the other hand, we are all human.  He didn't do anything, in general, criminal.  But we should probably talk to him.  Heart-to-heart. <br><br>  - So, I still need?  - Sergey began to slowly rise from his chair, carefully watching the director's confused monologue. <br><br>  - Oh, no, Sergey, thank you.  - thought up the director.  - I ... I do not even know ... Maybe we are with you ... Well, I do not know ... <br><br>  - What?  - Sergey stopped, not straightening to the end. <br><br>  ‚ÄúAh ... yes.‚Äù  - the director finally got together.  - Sergey, we need to talk again.  I think that with your dismissal there could be an oversight.  Already have a job offer?  I understand ... <br><br>  - Not.  - Sergey landed again. <br><br>  - Good.  Let's tomorrow, in the morning, we will discuss everything again.  And today I need to talk with Innocent.  So, he's ... Yes, I have to be at my house, there is something with Wi-Fi, my wife asked ... <br><br>  - Normally there with wifi.  - answered Sergey. <br><br>  - In terms of?  Do you know that?  - the director was taken aback. <br><br>  - Well yes.  In the morning I went, I did everything.  You did not think that this Kesha does? <br><br>  - Wait ... What exactly does? <br><br>  - Well, everything.  Grid around the house, GSM amplifiers, Wi-Fi repeaters, cameras, servachok in the garage ... I did all this.  Kesh only drove me in his lordly wheelbarrow, otherwise they could, apparently, not let me into your lonely village. <br><br>  - No, they would have let him pass the pass.  - the director did not notice the irony.  - Damn it ... So Kesha, as it turned out ... <br><br>  - Well, as it turned out. <br><br>  - Ok, come, let's talk.  It is not clear, really, what he is doing there so far ... Is it drawn, or what?  Activity imitates?  And what was there with Vayfay today, Sergey? <br><br>  - Your spouse asked to change the password.  She says she read somewhere that you need to change passwords periodically.  I do not care - I came, I did. <br><br>  ‚ÄúYes, passwords are yes ...‚Äù the director again fell into some mental prostration.  - Oh wait, give me a password?  And then my wife and I ... Well ... We quarreled a bit yesterday.  Well, you know how it happens ... It may well not tell the password, but I without wifi, as without hands ... <br><br>  - No problem.  - Sergey took out a smartphone, picked it up, found the password, took a piece of paper from the table and carefully rewrote a long, meaningless phrase on it: <br>  ZCtujlyz, elenhf [fnmczcndjbvBNlbhtrnjhjvRtitqgjrfnsnfvcblbimyfcdjtqchfyjqhf, jntxthnjdbvgjntyn <br><br>  - How long.  - proud of his wife, left the director.  - This is probably a difficult password?  In a sense, reliable? <br><br>  - Yes, there are different registers, special characters, and a decent length.  - confirmed Sergey.  - A serious security claim. <br><br>  - As soon as you remember it.  - the director turned a piece of paper with a password in his hands. <br><br>  - Yes, one time to drive, he will be remembered in the device.  In general, such passwords usually mean something.  This is some kind of phrase in Russian, which was typed in the English layout.  I was too lazy to translate, so I do not know ... <br><br>  - Well, okay, I will ask her when she leaves a little ... Maybe tomorrow ... Thank you, Sergey! <br><br>  - I am glad to help. <br><br>  - All right, see you tomorrow! <br><br>  - Well, I will in the morning. <br><br>  Sergey left the office in mixed feelings.  Since yesterday, having learned about dismissal, he managed to go through all the stages of grief.  For a couple of minutes there was denial, the anger lasted almost until the night, forcing the body to rinse with a shock dose of alcohol, bargaining was limited to an attempt to write an angry letter to Kesha, but the wife stopped, and in the morning, along with the hangover, depression started.  However, having reached the work, and then, having rolled up once again to the director's cottage, and having completed the work under the ‚Äútyzhprogrammist‚Äù sauce, Sergey accepted everything. <br><br>  Now the story made an unexpected turn.  Not dizzy, but unexpected.<font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The director will not chase Kesha for the story with a check, that's for sure. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">But to work Sergei, probably, look more carefully. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Although ... So, if you think about it, then ... Babakh! </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Sergey did not even understand how he was on the floor. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Something, or someone, swept along the corridor so quickly that it brought down the unfortunate programmer, like a coat hanger. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Raising his head, Sergey saw the vague silhouette of the running away director. </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">PS Look in the profile, if you have not been for a long time. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">There is a new reference.</font></font></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/460163/">https://habr.com/ru/post/460163/</a></p>
