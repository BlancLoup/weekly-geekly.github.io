It was normal, until you are pinned.  You always choose a very unfortunate moment.  For this, I love you, bastard, and hate. <br>  - How is the article?  - With a malice you asked. <br>  - Fine.  - I do not want, to be honest, to go into details. <br>  - Exactly normal? <br>  - Right. <br>  - Why then does she have such a low rating? <br>  - Do not go. <br>  - Again? <br>  - Again. <br>  - So maybe that? <br>  - What? <br>  - Well, you know ... <br>  - Not. <br>  I take out a cigarette, light a cigarette.  The dog is prowling in the grass, looking for something.  I never understood what she finds there.  Sometimes dead birds roll in the grass, but now the grass is rare, and there is definitely nothing on the clearing.  I follow the purity. <br>  - Why not something?  Maybe you will be honest with yourself?  - you continue with a serious face.  - Your articles - shit, and no one needs.  This is reality.  Everybody hates you.  You're just a graphomaniac.  Admit it. <a name="habracut"></a><br>  - What for? <br>  - What why? <br>  - Why should I admit it? <br>  - In terms of? <br>  - Are you dumb?  - I lose my temper a little.  - What are you, the court decided to arrange?  Why do you need this recognition? <br>  - Well, yes, by the way ... So admit it to yourself. <br>  - Ok, I admit.  Article shit.  I am a graphomaniac.  I already wrote an article where I admitted it. <br>  - And you - infoatsygan, if I correctly applied this word in the singular. <br>  - Yes, I - infoatsygan.  Everything? <br>  - Not.  - it is felt that your mood is improving.  - I just began.  You are nobody.  You can't do anything.  You are not able to create anything.  You never sell anything to anyone.  Your life is a sad shit, and nothing will ever change. <br>  - I know all this.  - I look you straight in the eye, trying to understand what will happen next. <br>  - Here you go. <br>  - Here you go.  - I repeat.  - Everything? <br>  - What is it all about? <br>  - What do you expect from me? <br>  ‚ÄúIf I knew ... I want you to stop trying.‚Äù <br>  - So what?  Lie down and die? <br>  - Not.  I just do not know.  Do not try anymore. <br>  - Why? <br>  - I want so. <br>  - Hmm ... - I smile.  ‚ÄúWhy should I care what you want there?‚Äù <br>  - How‚Ä¶ <br>  - Well, like this.  My life.  My articles.  My designs.  My job.  My unemployment.  My successes.  My failures.  What do you care? <br>  - Well, you listen ... <br>  - I listen to this crap all my life.  And from you, and from like you.  You will not make it.  You are doing nonsense.  You will never succeed.  And life proves the opposite. <br>  ‚ÄúSo what does she prove to you?‚Äù <br>  - Lack of absolute. <br>  - Again, a deep philosophy ... - you indulgently smile. <br>  ‚ÄúNot deeper than the poop the dog piled on.‚Äù  Be careful not to step on.  When I finish smoking, I will clean it along with the stub. <br>  - So what is the lack of absolute?  - you moved a little aside. <br>  - There are no authors of good articles, for example.  No one.  More precisely, not so - the author of a good article can only be the author of one article.  Anyone who writes a lot, sometimes gives shit. <br>  - Well it is clear. <br>  - Then what's the claim to me? <br>  - Your articles - shit. <br>  - Everything? <br>  - Everything. <br>  - How do you judge?  What are the criteria? <br>  - You think you need criteria?  After all, it is clear that shit. <br>  - And who then puts the benefits?  Who writes personal messages with questions on the case?  Who is subscribing? <br>  - Subscribe those who want to instantly respond to new publications and put a minus. <br>  - There are such.  - I nod.  ‚ÄúBut I‚Äôm looking at all my subscribers.‚Äù  Most - without the right to vote.  Many have registered at all, only to subscribe.  This is evident by the date of registration. <br>  - Anyway shit. <br>  - You look like a boy from a joke who listened, listened, and then said: I ... and I ... and I will give you all the same in the face! <br>  You shut up for a few seconds, obviously picking up words and arguments. <br>  - Okay, let's get down to business.  You did notice that the rating of your articles - comb? <br>  - It's hard not to notice. <br>  - What do you think it means? <br>  - That means two things.  First - there are articles in which I write what I want and how I want.  They are almost always in the red.  The second is that I do not know how to write so as to please the public.  Therefore, a high rating is rather an accident. <br>  - This is not a reason to stop writing? <br>  - Not. <br>  - Why not? <br>  - Why yes? <br>  - Well, because it does not work!  Are you dumb?  It does not work - do not write! <br>  ‚ÄúCan't what?‚Äù  Ratings high recruit? <br>  - Yes! <br>  - And where did you get that for the sake of ratings I'm writing? <br>  - I want you to write for ratings! <br>  - We sort of discussed already how I feel about what you want there.  I partly agree with you.  But I can not write for the sake of rating. <br>  - So quit! <br>  - What did you do!  - I lost my temper.  - What kind of mania to throw something that you can not do?  I told you - in this world there is nothing absolute, everything is permeated with probabilities.  If one article has entered, another will enter.  If the second has not gone, the third will go.  Fifth, tenth, not important.  It makes no sense, even harmful to set a plan, criteria, expectations by rating.  Here you are not Mutko and the Olympics, to make a plan of medals.  You need to understand how the world works. <br>  - Well, did you understand a lot about how the world works?  - again this sarcastic smile. <br>  - Not.  But more than you.  I would listen to you - I would have died long ago.  How much do you know, you always say - it did not work out, it does not work out, it does not work out.  After the first failure, you always say that you have to quit.  After the tenth, twentieth, hundredth failure, you are right there. <br>  - A hundred failure?  And you think I'm wrong? <br>  - I'm sure you're wrong.  Because the hundredth failure is preceded by ninety successes, and nine more failures.  You think only in absolute categories, you have a strange binary brain.  And the world is built on probabilities and funnels. <br>  - What other funnels? <br>  - As in sales.  Always, whatever you do, there is an entrance - traffic, flow, people, calls, it doesn't matter, and there is an exit - that result, for which everything was done.  Pros, money, offers, projects, etc.  Remember, and do not bother me already with this.  There is always a funnel.  There are always people in the world who care about what you do.  They just do not need it, not interesting.  Just as I'm not interested ... Well, I do not know ... Stones, birdhouses, asphalt, space.  These people will always pass by, but may enter the traffic.  Accidentally stumbled, read, and then forgot. <br>  ‚ÄúDo you think I'm an idiot and don't understand this?‚Äù <br>  - You understand perfectly.  But, seeing such a person who is not interested, you always say - aha, you did another shit!  Look, look, the guy passed by and didn‚Äôt even look!  Everything, it is necessary to throw!  You can‚Äôt do anything!  And the next person, who came up, became interested and moved to another level of the funnel, you will not even notice, because you are too busy with your choice of a glass. <br>  - I do not click ... <br>  - What a clicker!  All that pleases you in life is failures and failures.  You seek them out, carefully, thoughtfully, and when you find them, you rejoice!  And you expose as your own achievement - they say, it's me, I found and understood!  I said that it will not work!  And when it turns out, what are you doing? <br>  - What? <br>  - Well, tell me yourself. <br>  - Never mind‚Ä¶ <br>  - That's it!  Nothing!  Success does not interest you, from the word at all!  Turns you back from success.  Your whole model of the world turns upside down, you get depressed, the only way out of which is to look for new troubles, even in success!  Remember how you react, for example, to a successful article? <br>  - Well, I say that she ... I do not know, even ... <br>  - I know.  Or - it happened by chance.  Or - just the public idiots alone.  Or - bots used for cheating.  Or - normal authors on vacation, so you slipped. <br>  - Well, it's true!  - you cried.  - It can not be otherwise!  You yourself, without your boast, compare your opus with normal articles!  After all, the difference is obvious!  Everything is bad for you - the theme, presentation, structure, examples, pictures are even too lazy to look!  You do not need a lot of mind to see the difference! <br>  - It is necessary. <br>  - Do not! <br>  - It is necessary.  Only it is necessary not to see the difference, not for this the mind is needed.  Mind - in order to understand that the difference is not necessary. <br>  - I.e? <br>  - So like this.  Like in music.  Any song and group has fans.  And there is no point in comparing two groups or two songs.  Yes, there are some metrics - someone gives a lot of concerts, someone - a little.  Someone managed to earn on his work, and someone continues to play in the evening, after work.  But I equally like the successful Metallica and the little-known The Dartz.  You know The Dartz? <br>  - Yes, you turned me on. <br>  - Here you go.  Try to find a difference between them. <br>  - What is there to look for something ... Almost nothing in common. <br>  - Do you like both? <br>  - Well ... There are songs good both there and there. <br>  - And there are bad? <br>  ‚ÄúProbably it‚Äôs wrong to call them bad ...‚Äù you say thoughtfully.  - There are those that I do not like. <br>  - That is, if you speak in your terms, both groups have a comb? <br>  - Yes. <br>  - Well‚Ä¶ <br>  - What?  - you are perplexed. <br>  - I have a comb - I have to throw.  Do Metallica have a comb - should they throw too? <br>  - No, they have already achieved success.  The whole world knows them. <br>  - Ok ... Young performers - do they have a comb too? <br>  - Yeah, flat.  - smile you.  - Nobody listens to them at all. <br>  - And they should quit? <br>  - Of course not.  Well, that is, it‚Äôs not for me to judge, but I understand that time must pass before they are noticed, and the skill will increase, they will find themselves, the style will be formed ... <br>  - How?  - I wonder picture.  - After all, they fail!  Just like me!  Let them quit right away and go to the factory to work!  Needless to try, try.  You want this, don't you?  Stop trying? <br>  - I do not want, but offer.  You.  What do you suggest? <br>  - To whom? <br>  - Well, novice musicians. <br>  - Keep trying and expand the funnel. <br>  - In terms of? <br>  - Damn, you're really stupid ... I explained to you.  There are probabilities and a funnel.  Roughly speaking, let's say, imagine ... I listened to the whole world of the songs of this young group.  Well, that happened.  Having ears, yes heard.  How many of them will want to continue listening to this band? <br>  - I do not know‚Ä¶ <br>  - I do not know either.  Let's imagine that this is one person out of one hundred thousand.  So, we listened to seven billion, and became fans ... Seventy thousand? <br>  - Like so.  - you nod. <br>  - It seems yes ... to the bottom of the funnel, i.e.  to the result, it reaches 0.001%.  What does it mean? <br>  - What you need to throw. <br>  - No, foolish head.  This means that there are two directions for work.  The first is an increase in traffic in the first stage of the funnel.  With current efficiency, you need to bring a hundred thousand people to get one fan.  Tryndez hard, I must say.  Imagine - you posted a video with a song or a clip, and you need to be watched by one hundred thousand unique users. <br>  - Unreal. <br>  ‚ÄúWell, it‚Äôs not that unrealistic ... But the task, let's say, is ambitious.‚Äù  The second direction for work is to improve the funnel.  Make it so that until the end, the result reaches more than 0.001%.  A specific target figure is easy to calculate - you can go from the traffic.  That is, it is easier to understand how you can attract traffic, and to realize the goal by the result.  You divide one into another, you get the efficiency ratio of your funnel. <br>  - Is it like in Zen? <br>  - Yes, like that.  In Zen it is convenient - you can see impressions, clicks, readings and likes separately.  The funnel is more detailed.  And you understand what text was written in such a way that it was read and which one was not. <br>  - What are you working on? <br>  - And above the traffic, and above the efficiency of the funnel. <br>  - What exactly are you doing with traffic?  - Strange, your intonation has changed. <br>  - I try to write on different topics, with different methods of presentation, from different points of view on the same problems. <br>  - It turns out? <br>  - It seems yes.  At least, each article has its own reader.  I see. <br>  - By the comments? <br>  - No, according to personal messages.  Comments are not an indicator, there is a completely different logic. <br>  - And how are you working on the effectiveness of the funnel? <br>  - To be honest, quite messy, without a plan.  It would be necessary to organize somehow, but I don‚Äôt know how yet. <br>  - Or quit? <br>  - You again? <br>  - Yes, again.  It should not be.  Or it turns out or not.  You have to do what comes out, what you were born for, what goes easy, freely, with constant success.  You can not do and that, and the other, and the third.  You sprayed. <br>  - This is not a spraying, but synergy.  One helps the other. <br>  - Come on?  - picture you wonder.  - And how do your opuses help, for example, programming? <br>  - Awesome, to be honest.  The main thing - the skill of writing texts greatly helps in promotion.  I talked a lot with programmers - smart, talented, with interesting products.  Do you know what their main problem is? <br>  - Well enlighten me. <br>  - They can not declare themselves.  As in Google's old ad, Vasya is very clever, but nobody knows about it.  For them to write an article about their product is a dreadful task, to which it is even scary to approach.  They can prepare for months to write one publication.  And when they write, they will sell a couple of copies, it comes to them - one article is not enough.  Now the information lives differently - the flow.  It is impossible to put something in the stream so that it remains there forever.  The stream takes any information into oblivion in a few days.  Need constant feed, mentions, links.  For this you need to constantly write something. <br>  - And what to write constantly about the same program? <br>  - You see the root.  - I nod.  - This is the second aspect of the relationship of texts and product.  Roughly speaking, when developing a product, you should understand that you will write about it next time.  You have to plan the release so that was what to write about.  And not two paragraphs, but a full publication.  Such a publication works like a defibrillator.  Your product has already died, everyone has forgotten about it, only random sales are possible.  And then - discharge!  - and again all the attention to the product.  From a new angle, new opportunities, new practice of application, rethinking, cases, etc. <br>  - Well, and you sold a lot with your defibrillator? <br>  - You know the statistics.  Almost two dozen already, on some "bit" publications. <br>  - Is this the type of know-how? <br>  - Like yes. <br>  - Okay. <br>  You shut up, but the expression says not for long.  Clearly looking for some other shit to say.  You look at me.  Suddenly you smile. <br>  - How is losing weight?  - triumphant you ask. <br>  - All is well.  - I surely answer. <br>  - You, like, wanted to save the world, from obesity. <br>  - Yes, I did.  All ahead. <br>  - Seriously?  - you ask maliciously.  ‚ÄúHow can you save the world if you cannot save yourself?‚Äù <br>  - What makes you think that I can not save myself? <br>  - Well, you have not lost a damn thing. <br>  - Minus ten kilograms almost. <br>  - So it was a month ago. <br>  - Yes it was.  A month spent on an additional run-in of the model - investigated loose weight. <br>  - And how are you doing? <br>  - Perfectly.  He really is not assigned to such an interval of time.  So you can pause and eat like a horse.  And then dump again, and pretty quickly. <br>  - How fast? <br>  - In a few days to reset what was accumulated month. <br>  - You're lying. <br>  - I'm not lying.  - I take out the phone, show the schedule.  - Take a look yourself.  That's minus three for the day.  That's minus five in a week.  Here's yesterday's point - look, exactly the same as a month ago. <br>  You shut up.  It is evident that he was tired and did not know what to say. <br>  ‚ÄúSo you keep trying?‚Äù  - finally, you ask. <br>  - Yes.  I will.  That's the whole point.  The last thing I do is give up and stop trying.  I will even try to retire, I already have a plan.  So more interesting, so there is meaning. <br>  - And the failures? <br>  - And what about failures? <br>  - They ... I do not know ... terrible.  From their hands fall, I do not want to live, nasty thoughts in my head run.  I want to quit everything and ... Just live, work, watch TV shows and plump.  Without responsibility, aspirations, plans and attempts.  Right? <br>  - So.  But they do not deliver the failures themselves, but you, who come with them.  If it were not for you, the failure would have passed unnoticed.  I would just go on without wasting time talking to you. <br>  - Oh, well.  - smile you.  - I do not take much of your time.  I come only in the mornings, when you walk with the dog.  Just a few minutes a day. <br>  - I know.  I'm used to you, and I'm not afraid anymore.  I have long been prepared answers to all your questions.  You can't come up with anything new - just ‚Äúdon't try,‚Äù ‚Äúit won't work‚Äù, ‚Äúyou have to live easier‚Äù, ‚Äúknow your place‚Äù.  Even boring. <br>  - What then continue to talk?  I would ignore, and that's all. <br>  - I can not ignore my subconscious.  And I do not want.  In a sense, you're helping me.  Especially in moments of success - do not let fly into the clouds.  Well, like the ring of King Solomon.  I have long wanted to do this to myself ... So, thank you. <br>  - I am glad to help!  - sincerely you smile. <br>  - Come on, see you. <br>  - Tomorrow?  In the same place? <br>  - Yes. <br>  - Do not forget to remove the poop after the dog. <br>  - As always.  Until! </div>
