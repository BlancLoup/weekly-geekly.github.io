Suppose you are the director of a film for which you need to take a place from the top point (shooting from the top point is practically a must have for any movie, be it artistic or documentary), or, for example, you are a farmer and you should not lose a herd of cows, followed by only one shepherd in the village, who, as everyone knows, may inadvertently fall asleep. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/557/ee6/8aa/557ee68aa6689872ab210cbd6b648b38.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Or even more difficult - to determine the fault in the power line, the length of which is 5 thousand km.  As an option - send UAZ Loaf or Ural with a driver who will undertake to drive (if he can through our forests, fields and swamps) this distance under the lines and determine where the fault is. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/5a5/841/a6a/5a5841a6a56587f9f2ffd6128ddcf29d.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  A similar task is to periodically patrol a rail track in order to analyze its technical condition. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/075/6a4/835/0756a4835102afded9038eea0935b4f8.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Or else - you brought to the apartment the furniture that you had been waiting for so long, but the suppliers forgot to put a small detail in the kit, because of the lack of which you cannot fully assemble it.  What to do?  Turn the apartment into a warehouse and wait a few more months for this part to come from abroad? <br><br>  But a completely standard thing - a vending machine sells ice cream in the summer, but the freezer suddenly breaks.  What to do?  Calculate losses? <br><br>  And now closer to the point.  Such and similar tasks can be formulated, modeled, designed, and then prototyped in SAP D-Shop - the developers workshop. <br><br>  Studying, playing, exploring - that's all D-Shop is intended for.  Ultimately, the idea that SAP itself is putting into it - ‚Äúwe are inventing something here and building something‚Äù. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/83b/483/aac/83b483aac724208eca66a92068316cd0.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  The goal of D-Shop is to inspire its developers with new, perhaps crazy ideas, suggest new approaches, come up with new tasks, play with the latest technological innovations, experiment with advanced technologies. <br><br>  In D-Shop, you can actually print something on a 3D printer, play around with microcontrollers, build, for example, a small weather station to transfer temperature or humidity to the analytical system in the cloud. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/de2/1ce/c73/de21cec73410e7edf8fe9da0213c92ac.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Here you can try to work with the drone and write software to it that will perform the task you want to accomplish. <br><br>  The drone can be controlled, it has several video cameras.  He can put points in the GPS, he will take the necessary photos and return.  And it can rise to a height of up to 10 thousand meters. By the way, in Europe, for example, such drones are used to deliver goods from online stores. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/5f7/c5d/d8e/5f7c5dd8e4fe52a630300c37fd18fcb8.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Inside the D-Shop there is a different combination of hardware and software that can be used. <br><br>  Now everyone is talking about the industrial revolution, Industry 4.0, 3D printers and 3D technologies.  This revolution is not that planned, it is already underway.  Maybe we do not always notice it, but in many industries it has already come. <br><br>  UAVs that are used in Iraq and Afghanistan by the Americans are already printed in their entirety, i.e.  not individual parts are produced, but the entire aircraft at once.  And he is at the same time most surprising that he flies.  Those.  If you need to order spare parts now, in the case of printing, you just need to order material for the final product. <br><br>  Currently, 3D technology is widely used for the manufacture of dentures, the accuracy is extremely high (much higher than the master himself will do with his hands).  Such a printer is no longer worth the transcendental money, but about 20-30 K USD (they have it), which can pay off very quickly for the dental industry. <br><br>  3D - Industrial printer used in D-Shop. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/173/fea/f72/173feaf72e3d382361a191f204bc71c7.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  You can take any 3D model <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/e89/bc1/374/e89bc1374661b4c0d89e9fa031e4eb62.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  or scan it on a 3D scanner. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/f63/148/1b9/f631481b9aea94dbdab82ba0523b87d7.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  For example, if there is no kitchen detail, then it can be scanned and printed.  Even if the part is broken, it can be scanned and ‚Äúfixed‚Äù on the computer. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/24c/66f/d15/24c66fd15f4eaa59ee77cd996c611ae1.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Restrictions on the material of the printer does not exist. <br><br>  Steering wheel and virtual reality glasses - here you can feel like a huge truck driver and take a load from Milan to Paris, or ride a tank or fly an airplane. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/a87/573/d1d/a87573d1d1b0e2b400d62e109c4ba713.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  One of the scenarios for the use of glasses is to train employees in emergency situations. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/ff0/eb8/cf0/ff0eb8cf06c5543b91cb0b73ff64b570.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Putting on glasses, you begin to feel yourself in the place of some accident or incident, you see your hands in front of you, with which you can move objects or just move through this virtual reality and learn how to act correctly. <br><br>  Another task is working in a warehouse and picking (collecting) orders for end users.  Imagine how many different types of parts, spare parts, etc., exist, for example, for car repairs?  Quickly collect an order in the presence of thousands of items - the task is practically impossible.  And here, too, you can use glasses, which will scan bar codes on the shelves where the spare part is, and check the correctness of the positions.  Using the software that is used when these glasses work, you can upload orders for the employee‚Äôs entire working day to memory, synchronize data at certain points in time, which will additionally allow you not to create a large wireless network through warehouses. <br><br>  And what will the vending machine do? <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/2cb/302/cb9/2cb302cb9e26ecc2a14ee2afc1a50f99.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  selling ice cream, for example, when the freezer breaks?  She will determine that the freezer has broken and will loudly invite everyone to buy ice cream from her, and at a very attractive price.  It is better to miss profits than to calculate losses. <br><br>  It is a lot of ideas, and in absolutely different branches, it is necessary to experiment. <br>  Do you have any ideas?  Want to share? <br><br>  By the way, be sure to come to the event, which holds SAP specifically for bloggers.
