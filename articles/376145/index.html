      The camera is equipped with highly sensitive motion and sound sensors that instantly inform the wearer of changes in the frame, reporting all means of push notification (as a text message or photo), and the infrared illumination provides the possibility of using a video camera in a room with lights turned off! <br><br>  When properly configured, all data is automatically saved to the Google cloud storage, where it can be downloaded to your PC / mobile device at any time, or to a microSD card. <br><br>  The presence of the standard (and the protocol of the same name) Wi-Fi Protected Setup (WPS), i.e.  secure installation, makes possible the semi-automatic creation of a wireless Wi-Fi network, thereby simplifying the process of setting up a wireless network.  This protocol automatically denotes the name of the network and sets encryption to protect the wireless Wi-Fi network from unauthorized access to the network.  Thus, there is no need to manually set all the parameters, which is great for those users who do not have extensive knowledge of security in wireless networks or have other difficulties.  Thus, no one will have access to your video stream and data, the information is encrypted with a 256-bit key. <br><br><h3>  Unboxing </h3><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/f99/96c/b64/f9996cb642e944a3a5f49889c5437ce1.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/bee/412/15d/bee41215d42642a5b87dde7bca97640f.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/1ec/f13/a3b/1ecf13a3b4554538b611df6f7c3949e3.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/f87/eb6/35e/f87eb635e26d4355ad476134348f1053.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/861/0e6/7ee/8610e67ee0904217a6e82db64a3d0fcf.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/fa4/522/a44/fa4522a441034f10a2cdbbaf0083aead.jpg"><br><br>  Kit <br>  ‚Ä¢ iCam HD 360 - wireless HD-camera; <br>  ‚Ä¢ Power adapter; <br>  ‚Ä¢ Quick Start Guide. <br><br><h3>  Installation of hardware and software </h3><br>  It is required to perform several uncomplicated actions: <br><br>  1. Download iCam HD 360 application on your smartphone / tablet; <br><br>  2. Run the downloaded application; <br><br>  3. Connect the camera to the network, click on the ‚ÄúNext‚Äù button in the opened application; <br><br>  4. Wait for 25 seconds, the camera will automatically rotate in a horizontal direction and at the same time the blue indicator will blink on the front panel with an interval of 1 second, after a while it will cease to rotate, again in the application you need to click on ‚ÄúNext‚Äù; <br><br>  5. You should make sure that the phone is connected to the Wi-Fi network, select ‚ÄúNext‚Äù; <br><br>  6. In the next window, you only need to enter the network password, since  the program itself has already defined the network and configured it automatically thanks to the WPS protocol mentioned above, and select ‚ÄúNext‚Äù; <br><br>  Attention!  If the network password is entered incorrectly, the program will not let you know about it, no notification will pop up, in this case, further actions will be meaningless, so make sure that the entered password is correct in advance! <br><br>  7. The application forms 2 QR codes that need to be shown to the camera at a distance of 10-30 cm from the lens. <br><br>  8. If you have done everything correctly, you will hear the soundtrack of the camera in the form of a click, then a special small window will pop up on your mobile device, where you will need to select the detected camera, and after successful synchronization there will be another soundtrack, but not in the form of a click, but slightly longer. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/554/e87/56a/554e8756a62a4f4d8b44fa8478ddf97e.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/f86/d50/ba3/f86d50ba3f304510a2af2f6edfeee8f2.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/9b2/d5a/a9c/9b2d5aa9c0e64b7d9ce352c164e5cc34.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/af5/bae/121/af5bae121df5498eb01d389e2d076069.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/e8f/b70/a28/e8fb70a286c041a79e11832c211c51b0.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/a61/b30/83f/a61b3083f26f4c068e97d90eff7a6e0a.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/6de/4eb/f5f/6de4ebf5fb874639a16a9a8cc9006008.jpg"><br><br>  <b>The device is ready for use.</b>  If you have problems in points 7 and 8, and you are convinced that this is not related to the incorrectly entered network password, there is a device reset button on the back panel to the factory settings, which can be reached with a banal paper clip or a needle.  In this case, repeat everything from point 2. <br><br>  After successful installation of the equipment, a window will open with all available cameras.  iCam HD 360 can also be of interest because with the presence of several cameras, the owner can view streaming video from all cameras simultaneously.  If you click on the desired camera in the application, icons with various functions will appear on the left side of the screen. <br><br>  <b>Examples of photos taken by the camera (when you click on the photo, an image of the original size will open):</b> <br><br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/aa8/d81/df8/aa8d81df84834e09aa5b40fc9a3320d6.jpg"></a> <br><br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/87d/5f0/37c/87d5f037c238433298171886c24e35b4.jpg"></a> <br><br>  <b>Top down:</b> <br><br><ul><li>  Video call - video call; </li><li>  Change avatar - change the avatar; </li><li>  Setting - installation; </li><li>  Change Wi-Fi - change the Wi-Fi access point; </li><li>  Add a new device - add a new device; </li><li>  Alert notification - alert notification; </li><li>  User manual - user manual; </li><li>  Music player - music player; </li><li>  Google Drive viewer - Google Drive browser; </li><li>  Help - help. </li></ul><br><br>  To keep track of what is happening, you need to click on the ‚ÄúVideo Call‚Äù triangle icon in the upper left corner.  To rotate the camera, you need to slide your finger in the right direction on the screen of the mobile device.  It is worth noting that the camera receives the command almost immediately, but it reacts with a delay after about 2 seconds, and the entire broadcast is about the same late, but the HD quality of the video stream allows you to close your eyes to it. <br><br>  <b>Settings:</b> <br><br><ul><li>  In the ‚ÄúAlert detection‚Äù window, you can activate or deactivate the privacy mode, sound and motion sensors, adjust the sound sensitivity, change the push notification mode (either as snapshots or as text), and enable / disable sound and vibro notification. </li><li>  In the "Viwer" window ("Browser"), you can configure it so that other mobile devices or computers have access to video broadcasting; </li><li>  In the ‚ÄúRecording‚Äù window, the resolution of the video recorded on the SD card and the ability to record to it are set up. </li><li>  In the ‚ÄúGoogle Drive upload‚Äù window, the upload mode to the server (continuous or as a separate event), the account itself, the video visibility, i.e.  type of video access (private or public) and available disk space. </li><li>  In the ‚ÄúSound‚Äù window you can adjust the speaker volume, microphone activity and the possibility of two-way audio communication. </li><li>  In the ‚ÄúWi-Fi AP list‚Äù window, the current Wi-Fi connection is selected. </li><li>  In the ‚ÄúMiscellaneous‚Äù window, it is possible to enable / disable the night vision mode, display the time mark on the video and photo with a push notification, backlight compensation, setting the time zone. </li><li>  In the "About iCam HD 360" window ("About iCam HD 360") you can find information about the program version, firmware, models and other specifications. </li></ul><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/7b2/18a/719/7b218a719d7949f4b4615fef24560596.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/558/8df/f91/5588dff915be44ee91db046ba08f1544.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/8ea/361/4a7/8ea3614a739e45089e10a84e25da7ac3.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/db9/79b/a9b/db979ba9bfd74fb19b87955d10368c9a.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/577/f5d/919/577f5d919df9434e948cb75c22d288a8.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/340/1f2/e17/3401f2e17780455ab32d69b0ce212587.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/25d/8c6/1d9/25d8c61d96504ab5bb97b2bd1aa72e83.jpg"><br><br><h3>  Application </h3><br>  Such cameras are appropriate almost everywhere as a household security system, in homes where there are domestic animals, as a controlled baby monitor, in hospitals and clinics, where relatives are hospitalized.
