  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Startup factory</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"> In an interesting time we live! <br>  <strong>Now we see quantitative changes:</strong> <br>  - increase in the number of users; <br>  - increase in speed along with a decrease in the cost of access to the network; <br>  - increase the capabilities of mobile systems; <br>  - increase the number of services in the network. <br>  <strong>These quantitative changes will lead to qualitative, namely:</strong> <a name="habracut"></a><br>  - In the near future there will be self-organizing networks, the prototype of which is Habr, where, subject to confidentiality, a clear network authorization will be implemented, there will be laws and rules that each participant will have to follow.  The rules will establish the network and this will allow it to change qualitatively.  From an anarchic cluster of users to socialize to highly organized communities that are able to set and achieve goals in the field of business, social movements, solutions of social issues and tasks. <br>  - Structuring users and manageability of network communities will allow to build new types of business in the network. <br>  The scheme of gathering crowds of users under any pretext and showing them advertisements will become completely ineffective. <br>  Portals and networks will build their business, sell products and services directly, without intermediaries with their advertising. <br>  - Portals and networks will be able to create conditions under which users themselves will create goods and services, and will earn on it.  The quantity (due to mass character) and the quality (due to interest) of goods and services will lead to the extinction of many offline businesses or their transfer to the network. <br><br>  <strong>New speeds, new quality of portals will require new technology to create them.</strong>  I will try to analyze the current mechanism for creating startups (I‚Äôm exploring only a particular approach, large and small firms also launch startups, but for now we don‚Äôt touch them). <br><br>  <strong>So, the analysis.</strong> <br>  Who starts startups? <br>  1. one who has an idea; <br>  2. the one who has an idea and some part of knowledge for its implementation; <br>  3. A group of friends, comrades or acquaintances, possessing an idea, a part of knowledge, possibly having a part of equipment and part of financing. <br>  <strong>Tasks of the startup organizer:</strong> <br>  1. Building a business in order to obtain permanent income or one-time income from its sale. <br>  2. Getting fame, popularity as a creator or organizer with the subsequent conversion into good employment, money or just a good memory. <br>  3. Getting experience and training. <br>  <strong>Startup issues:</strong> <br>  1. Selection of specialists: the lack of a required profile or level in a team of specialists. <br>  2. Management: lack of experience in team management and / or project implementation. <br>  3. Financing: insufficient funding. <br>  4. Separation of work, shares, money and profits: the lack of clear internal arrangements with their legally significant fixation on paper; <br>  5. Legal and legal issues, copyright issues: the lack of a team of specialists to analyze and record the results of its activities. <br>  6. Compliance with the sequence.  Dropout or incomplete carrying out the following steps: <br>  a.  idea development in detail; <br>  b.  drawing up a business plan; <br>  c.  development of TZ; <br>  d.  implementation, intermediate control, launch of the project; <br>  e.  starting advertising and promotion of the project; <br>  f.  turning the project into a steadily growing, managed business. <br>  7. Implementation speed: slow implementation - obsolescence of the idea before the start of the project, slow promotion - lagging behind the competitors who copied the idea. <br>  <strong>Startups now are a common offline business</strong> .  Despite the fact that the product should work on the Internet, the current technology of creating a startup practically does not use its capabilities.

      The above problems lead to the fact that the way out from startups to a successful business, I think, is much less than 1%. <br><br>  Why is the yield percentage so low?  Because the success and performance of the system are determined by the quality of the weakest link! <br>  In the usual technology of creating startups there are not only links of insufficient quality, but also simply missing or missing links.  This happens because the group implementing the project has very limited resources and is forced to do everything independently, that is, theoretically, it is a technology of handicraft production. <br>  So Adam Smith described making a pin not for us! <br>  It turns out that the knowledge and use of the theory of the division of labor is available only to large companies that implement projects like this (well, or inexpensive startups). <br><br>  <strong>I suggest everyone to take part and create a project "Factory Startups" (FS)</strong> , free from the above problems and shortcomings as much as possible. <br><br>  <strong>Basic principles of construction:</strong> <br>  - Maximum competence.  Dynamic selection of specialists from a wide range. <br>  - Maximum interest.  Each participant is a shareholder of the future enterprise. <br>  - Maximum efficiency.  Creating a competitive atmosphere within the project among developers.  (I will explain later) <br>  - The most accurate administration of projects. <br>  - The possibility of nesting ideas. <br>  - Minimum sufficient funding for a startup. <br>  - Work only on commercial projects. <br><br>  <strong>Brief technology work:</strong> <br>  1. Description of the idea for an open discussion. <br>  2. We register users who want to participate in the discussion of the project. <br>  3. Select a group of project administrators (1-3 people). <br>  4. Go to a closed discussion. <br>  5. Detailed ideas in the process of discussion. <br>  6. A group of administrators is preparing a business plan. <br>  7. Discussion of the business plan. <br>  8. The group of administrators divides the entire scope of work into parts (tasks).  Each task receives a verbal description, it also describes the performer‚Äôs qualifications and the percentage of share capital attributable to the task. <br>  9. Participants submit applications for participation in work on a specific task.  Formed the main development teams for each task.  Formed <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blog/startups_factory/28599.html">competitive groups (I will describe in more detail later)</a> . <br>  10. Calculation of the necessary funding and the allocation of a percentage of share capital for the investor.  Auction investors. <br>  11. Registration of participants and investors, the creation and signing of an internal contract. <br>  12. Transition of the registered group to the closed state. <br>  13. The group of administrators writes TZ. <br>  14. Discussion of TK and the definition of boundaries for tasks and development groups.  The statement of TZ. <br>  15. Development of the project implementation schedule. <br>  16. Launching a project, supervising administrators of intermediate results and deadlines, maintaining a project schedule, operational management. <br>  17. Fixing the delivery of tasks.  Start testing. <br>  18. The distribution of the percentage of share capital allocated for a specific task within the working groups.  Determination of interest on competitive groups (to be described later).  Approval of the list of project participants with the appropriate percentage of shares. <br>  19. Legal registration of a company (organized by a group of administrators) with registration of shares in accordance with the approved list (Clause 18) and the contract with the investor. <br>  20. Receiving from the investor the agreed amounts to the account of the company. <br>  21. Starting a project, launching promotion. <br>  22. After the project reaches the level of profitability - the formation of the board of directors and the implementation of the traditional functioning of a commercial enterprise. <br><br>  <strong>Description of the project.</strong> <br>  To work on projects using the above described technology, it is necessary to create a FS portal, the interface of which should include the following blocks: <br>  - registration of participants on the portal, registration as an executor of a specific project; <br>  - maintaining a rating of participants; <br>  - authorization of participants; <br>  - discussion interface, forums, wiki-interface, brainstorming interface; <br>  - message exchange; <br>  - graphical interface for monitoring project schedules; <br>  - storage of documents and practices. <br><br>  <strong>Project FS to do the same technology.</strong>  <strong>Investor money to spend on:</strong> <br>  - procurement of equipment on which the portal itself will be located and on which it will be possible to work during the project preparation period; <br>  - The organization of legal support and support for copyright (details later). <br><br>  <strong>Proposed distribution of percentages:</strong> <br>  - the author of the idea - 5% <br>  - administrator (each) - 5% <br>  - portal FS - 5% <br>  - investor - 10% (can vary in a wide range depending on the specific project) <br>  - to encourage competitive groups - 5% <br>  - for unforeseen expenses - 5% <br>  - 60% - for a group of developers (may vary in accordance with the interest rate of the investor). <br><br>  <strong>Cons (difficulties) of this technology:</strong> <br>  - Mutual distrust of participants.  This is a natural state when strangers begin to work and work involves money and roles.  This minus will be overcome with work experience, rating of participants within the system, drawing up internal and legally executed contracts and documents. <br>  - The complexity of remote development.  Partially reduced by the portal interface FS and clear administration.  With the development of the portal and an increase in the number of participants for the most critical, in terms of joint development, tasks, it may be possible to select a working group from one city. <br>  - Open description of ideas.  It makes the idea a common property and allows the emergence of competitive groups trying to implement the idea.  Excessive openness exists only at the initial stage, while a detailed discussion takes place in a closed group.  This approach provides an important competitive advantage - quick recruitment and more productive project launch.  An open discussion of the idea does not eliminate competitors, but only gives the time needed to develop the project.  In many respects, it‚Äôs not the starting point that will be decisive, but the speed of promotion, financing and the quality of project execution. <br>  - Work without a salary.  Initially it was conceived that the participants were working to get a share of the share, but it is quite possible that for someone it will be necessary to receive money in the process.  It is possible to solve this by an agreement between the participant and the investor, according to which the investor acquires a part of a share or a participant‚Äôs share at the beginning of the project.  This approach is, of course, deeply individual, it depends on work experience and the level of risk.  The problem is solved by mutual agreement of the parties. <br>  - Remote work = low sense of responsibility.  The project should insure itself as much as possible from the situation when the participant, not having the proper qualifications or the proper desire for work, wants to ‚Äújust try‚Äù and thus jeopardizes any development task.  The problem is solved on three levels: <br>  1. the introduction of maximum responsibility through the participants rating system and work distribution system; <br>  2. registration with statement of qualifications and portfolio; <br>  3. By entering passport data, which, in consequence, will be issued documents shareholding share. <br>  Thus, a participant can register in the Startup Factory system only once and his rating will be maintained continuously.  Unreasonable failure (non-confirmation of the declared qualifications) in any project task will make it more difficult for him to participate in subsequent projects.  Also, this minus is eliminated by the introduction of a <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blog/startups_factory/28599.html">system of competitive</a> development tasks. <br><br>  <strong>Advantages of this technology:</strong> <br>  - The Startup Factory is the first project in the world that allows the author to sell a bare idea for 5% of future capital!  After the implementation of the first projects and the publicity of this feature will attract a lot of interesting ideas and innovative proposals. <br>  - The Startup Factory is the first project where offline specialists can become full-fledged participants and shareholders of a startup.  For example, advertising specialists, copywriters, etc., depending on the subject of the project.  This feature will allow to attract good specialists (which, in my opinion, now start-ups are especially lacking) without investing money for investors in their search. <br>  - The Startup Factory is a project where each participant makes a decision based on a ready-made business plan, investing his time and work in the task.  Anyone will be able to participate in large projects and, in fact, build their business without start-up capital, choosing their tasks according to their qualifications and capabilities. <br><br>  I propose to discuss the whole idea and article here as usual. <br>  Continuing the article <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blog/startup/29235.html">here</a> . <br>  Those who wish to participate in the project or for a more detailed discussion are invited to the <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blog/startups_factory/">Startup Blog of the Factory.</a> <br><br>  <em>PS Before publishing the article, I asked some friends of the first circle to express their opinions and comments.</em>  <em>And now I want to thank:</em> <em><br></em>  <em><a href="http://lulek.habrahabr.ru/">Lulek</a> - for evaluation and recommendations;</em> <em><br></em>  <em><a href="http://sk1p.habrahabr.ru/">sk1p</a> - for editing, editing and bringing in a readable state;</em> <em><br></em>  <em><a href="http://amilner.habrahabr.ru/">amilner</a> - for sensible criticism, in-depth analysis of the process and the article <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blog/startup/28295.html">‚ÄúStart -‚Äú an ‚Äùor‚Äú down ‚Äù?</a></em>  <em><a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blog/startup/28295.html">A guide for Dummies ... with ideas ‚Äù</a> that lands a little enthusiasm, but brings it closer to life.</em> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/15378/">https://habr.com/ru/post/15378/</a></p>
