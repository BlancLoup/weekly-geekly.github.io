Factors </h2><br>  Denote a few basic factors that force businesses to access the Internet of things: <br>  - <b>expanding the role and value of information resources and channels of information interaction</b> (forcing to actively penetrate and work with information flows on the Internet); <br>  - <b>complication and enrichment of economic and business relations</b> (makes it necessary to master modern means of establishing long-term and productive relations in the near and long distances, at the same time increasing their quality level); <br>  - <b>mobility and active change of ideas about what to do and how to do</b> (suggests in the Internet environment to follow ideas, events, leaders and intercept, adapt or develop, win over or conduct research); <br>  - <b>deepening of production, technological, strategic and economic specialization</b> (leads to the fact that it is cheaper and more rational to implement part of business processes on the side, ie by outsourcing on a permanent or temporary basis, including within the framework of various Internet services and tools ); <br>  - <b>intensive access to the relevant successful experience of another business</b> (expands mutual consultations and trainings, conferences and discussions in online communications or shared knowledge bases on the Internet, and also encourages the active use of data accumulated by third-party businesses); <br>  - <b>expanding the role of professional communities, unions, associations</b> (pushes for information interaction on an ongoing basis, including via Internet communication channels); <br>  - <b>increased competition for resources and markets</b> (stimulates the search for new ways to fight for resources and markets, quickly monitoring the internal and market conditions, processing information flows and interacting with various individuals and systems in the network for a forward or proactive response); <br>  - <b>maintaining a high degree of adaptability of the organizational structure and relationships with the external environment</b> (stipulates the creation by the business of some internal infrastructure of sustainable development linked to various external elements, including through the exchange of information via communication channels); <br>  - the <b>expansion of multitasking and a broad interpretation of the missions (strategies) of businesses</b> as socially significant and economically viable, including non-contradictory civic values ‚Äã‚Äã(allows the business to actively integrate into social networks and subject communities with practical marketing values ‚Äã‚Äãand with advantages to improve the image business). <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/465/0e8/f1e/4650e8f1e0d74fe2b86a112f62253161.png"><br><br><h2>  3. Objects </h2><br>  An object for business is any economic entity, resource, asset, event, algorithm, action, etc.  If someone or something is of particular interest to a business and somehow can be useful for use in its activities, then this will be a business object. <br>  With greater certainty, it is possible to characterize any business object as a target, i.e.  an object involved by the business in its activities with a specific purpose. <br><br>  Business somehow involves the following <b>kinds of objects</b> : <br><ul><li>  production resources (for example, raw materials, materials, semi-finished products, components); </li><li>  productive resources (for example, buildings, equipment, buildings); </li><li>  technological resources (for example, tools, techniques, technologies, techniques and solutions); </li><li>  information resources (eg, data, knowledge, practices, intangible assets); </li><li>  human resources (for example, personnel, training system, social networks, entrepreneurship); </li><li>  financial resources (for example, loans, funds, ownership shares); </li><li>  strategic management elements (for example, mission, objectives, tactical and operational tasks and work); </li><li>  organizational elements (for example, plans, forecasts, analytics, control system); </li><li>  direct market actors (for example, customers, potential consumers, communities); </li><li>  third-party market actors (eg, competitors, partners, suppliers, associations, regulators). </li></ul><br>  The list is obviously incomplete, it can be continued and detailed based on the objectives and features of a particular business. <br><br>  By <b>way of engaging</b> in business, objects can be characterized as follows: <br><ul><li>  <b>direct inclusion in the business</b> (full inclusion of the object in the structure or business model for a long-term period, for example, the acquisition of property in the property or hiring staff); </li><li>  <b>temporary use</b> (partial or time-limited attraction of an object to a business, for example, rental of property or attraction of an employee under a fixed-term employment agreement); </li><li>  <b>supplier</b> (provides business with different objects, i.e. is attracted by the business in the supply chain); </li><li>  <b>source of information</b> (provides businesses with different types of information); </li><li>  <b>the recipient</b> (accepts different objects from the business, i.e. is attracted by the business in the distribution chain); </li><li>  <b>information consumer</b> (accepts different types of information from business); </li><li>  <b>client</b> (receives certain objects from business as a result of trade transactions); </li><li>  <b>the regulator</b> (provides the business with a special kind of objects that regulate the behavior of the business); </li><li>  <b>representative</b> (accepts from the business of a special kind of objects that regulate the behavior of the representative); </li><li>  <i>other involvement</i> (other ways to attract the object). </li></ul><br>  It is allowed such a difficult situation in which one object is involved in business in different ways.  Most likely this may be a necessary measure to circumvent a number of formal or practical limitations. <br><br>  According to the <b>technology of inclusion of</b> objects in the business, you can say: <br><ul><li>  o directly included in the business (in- <i>person</i> ); </li><li>  about remotely included in the business ( <i>through special communication</i> ); </li><li>  about indirectly included in the business ( <i>through some intermediary or a chain of intermediaries</i> ); </li><li>  about hidden-included in the business ( <i>when the object does not understand that it carries out certain actions in the interests of some business</i> ); </li><li>  about impersonal-included in the business ( <i>when the object is involved as a source of some data, and often transmitted within the framework of aggregated statistics</i> ); </li><li>  about business reservation ( <i>entering or storing an object in a certain list or registry for its possible subsequent involvement</i> ). </li></ul><br>  Understanding and indicating a business object is, to a certain extent, easier than understanding and formulating a business process. <br>  A business object is some and any holistic-perceived entity related to the business (included in the business model).  Objects significant for business are subject to research and formalization and it is important not even to single out the maximum number of objects, but to simultaneously structure and define key characteristics and mutual relationships. <br><br>  Designing a business based on business objects allows you to: <br><ul><li>  simplify the procedure for its development and understanding of its essence and composition; </li><li>  involve a wide range of specialists; </li><li>  offer a flexible model for research and formalization; </li><li>  use a wide range of object-oriented design tools to develop automated control systems; </li><li>  find standard and regular components of the model for their "replication"; </li><li>  establish hidden characteristics and relationships of model elements; </li><li>  create a simple and understandable model thesaurus; </li><li>  introduce flexible business process design; </li><li>  increase the level of abstraction of the business model, and thus increase its manageability. </li></ul><br>  A managed object can be defined as a simple or complex element of a business, it can have several or many connections.  But for modeling, it represents a convenient operating unit, which also has: <br><ol><li>  <b>integrity</b> - indivisibility in the given conditions; </li><li>  <b>static</b> - immutability for a certain period of time; </li><li>  <b>essence</b> - attribution within the established requirements; </li><li>  <b>structure</b> - the ability to be divisible on demand in the given conditions; </li><li>  <b>subjectivity</b> - the ability to be perceived and controlled as one element of the model; </li><li>  <b>a formality</b> - the ability to be described with the help of some information that can be processed and distributed. </li></ol><br><br>  <i><a href="https://megamozg.ru/post/25592/">(continued - Part 6.
