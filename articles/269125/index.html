Today it was announced that <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/big-news-enterprise-php-andi-gutmans">RogueWave Software acquired Zend</a> and can now manage the entire LAMP stack used by many enterprise users. <br><br>  Zend is the core of the php community.  With its founders Andi Gutmans Zeev Suraski, working on the Zend Engine (the thing that turns all our PHP code into something useful).  And a set of software, including Zend Framework, Zend Server and Zend Studio. <br><br>  If you look at RogueWave, it seems that Zend will be a good addition to what RogueWave is already offering.  It seems that everyone should be happy.

      But let's not stop the tweeter analysis.  And this article includes not only congratulations, but also predictions of possible future PHP problems.  That's what I think can happen. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h2>  Zend in the usual sense will disappear </h2><br>  Judging by what I know about corporate mergers, we have at least two or three years before we feel any major changes. <br><br>  Now there will be a normal smooth process, when a newly acquired company is allowed to work in the same way as they worked several years before, until everyone understands what's what, especially with a friendly merger.  Zend will remain the same for some time. <br><br>  After this smooth mitigating period, we will begin to notice changes, I'm sure of it.  Zend will gradually begin to pursue the same licensing policy that RogueWave now leads.  Release plans will begin to coincide, joint work on projects is more strictly controlled, etc. <br><br>  I do not know, good or bad.  I am a little familiar with RogueWave personally, and it does not seem like Zend is going to stop there. <br><br>  I hope at least.  I'm still waiting for the next ZendCons in Las Vegas. <br><br><h2>  Zend Engine licensing will be changed </h2><br>  PHP and Zend Engine are now distributed under <a href="https://github.com/php/php-src/blob/master/Zend/LICENSE">PHP License</a> . <br><br>  There is a line at the top that is troubling: <br><blockquote>  Copyright 1999-2006 Zend Technologies Ltd.  All rights reserved. <br></blockquote><br>  Zend owns the copyright of the Zend Engine, and this gives them the opportunity to install a license.  What is Zend Engine?  This is what PHP does ... PHP. <br><br>  This is what turns the code we write into something that the server understands and makes our code work. <br>  The only player who can compare with him is HHVM (although there are others, but HHMV is the only one I saw in combat). <br><br>  And, as the copyright holder, Zend / RogueWave have the full right to change the license for something more liberal, or vice versa closed.  This is their choice. <br><br>  And if they decide to do this, they will not be able to retroactively change this for previous versions.  The PHP community can continue to use previous versions of the Zend Engine.  they are distributed under PHP license and to boycott the ‚Äúnew‚Äù Zend Engine.  Life will show. <br><br>  In fact, there is already a precedent.  When Zend released phpng, there was talk of not using it.  PHP can and will migrate with Zend Engine, if required.  We can also safely use previous versions of Zend Engine, distributed under the old license. <br><br>  In the worst case, we will switch to HHVM and we will have to fix some bugs in it. <br><br><h2>  License change [Update - 2015-10-06 2:05 pm] </h2><br>  They pointed out to me a misunderstanding of how Zend can change the license. <br>  This process is much more complicated than the one described above.  Nevertheless, being the copyright holder of Zend Engine, Zend may change the license for it. <br><br>  True, this will require some effort.  in PHP, everyone who contributes to the development owns the copyright to their own code. <br>  As a result, there is no single rightholder; everyone who has contributed to the development has certain rights. <br><br>  As a result, everyone must agree to change the license. <br>  Joomla went through a similar procedure when trying to change the Joomla Framework license to the LGPL.  This required finding all those who contributed under the old license and collecting signatures for the new license.  It was a great job, but they did it. <br><br>  So Zend has rights to the Zend Engine and may try to change the license if everyone agrees.  I do not think this will happen.  I bet we can change the engine much earlier than this happens. <br><br>  As a worst case scenario, I do not rule out the emergence of a new engine from RogueWave, which will be compatible with Zend Engine / (or what we will use there in the future).  Even more compatible than it is now HHVM.  HHVM has already proven that there is a demand for improved PHP, compatible with Zend Engine and, at the same time, with nice additions. <br><br>  This will allow RogueWave to offer ‚Äúenterprise PHP‚Äù to its customers, just like Oracle offers its own version of Redhat. <br><br>  If this happens, I hope RogueWave will call it ‚ÄúRogue Engine‚Äù.  RogueWave can use this name with my written consent. <br><br><h2>  Zend Framework will die </h2><br>  No, he will not die.  Zend Framework is not only an entry point to a comprehensive Zend product line, but also an open source project. <br><br>  Anyone can fork it and work on it.  Zend Framework is also a major player in the field of PHP frameworks, with a lively community and a huge user base. <br><br>  Provided that Zend employees make the main contribution to the development of the Zend Framework, but its license is quite loyal, I am confident that the community will continue to work on it.  Even if RogueWave doesn't want to support him anymore. <br><br>  In the same time?  it seems that RogueWave is heavily embedded in Open Source and the Zend Framework is perfect for their customers.  I doubt that the future of the Zend Framework is threatening anything. <br><br><h2>  Then congratulate RogueWave and Zend </h2><br>  At the same time, I want to congratulate Zend and RogueWave on their union.  They are great for each other and that means it will be better suited for an enterprise. <br><br>  Perhaps in a few years I will take my words back, but I am sure that now my friends at Zend will gladly move forward. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/269125/">https://habr.com/ru/post/269125/</a></p>
