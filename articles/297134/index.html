While investors of large funds are waiting, the activity of business angels is growing. <br><br>  <a href="http://firrma.ru/">Firrma.ru</a> publication together with RVK and <a href="http://rusangels.ru/">NABA</a> (National Association of Business Angels) analyzed the work of Russian private investors in 2015.  The study included those business angels who made at least one venture transaction in the last year, but not less than two in the last two years. <br><br>  The main rating criterion is the number of projects invested in a year.

      Therefore, this list is not the best angels, but those who continue to invest most actively in startups. <a name="habracut"></a><br><br><h4>  Game "four wings" </h4><br>  The new rating confirmed the trend of recent years: business angels prefer to invest together with partners.  True, if earlier they did it, including with the funds of the early stages, now they work mostly only with each other.  Of the 23 business angels who filled out the questionnaire for Firrma, 13 syndicated all transactions for the last year - including through the Internet platforms (SmartHub) and thanks to the work of business angel clubs (VentureClub, Skolkovo Business Angels Club). <br><br><h4>  Issue price </h4><br>  Russian business angels invest not too large amounts in each project - usually $ 50‚Äì100 thousand and often even $ 25‚Äì50 thousand. <br><br><h4>  Being a guest is good, but being at home is better </h4><br>  The vast majority of business angels surveyed by Firrma invest in Russian start-ups - apparently, this is due to the fact that in a familiar environment it is easier to syndicate transactions and discuss working conditions with entrepreneurs.  Only some private investors invest in Israeli, American and European startups. <br><br><h4>  Inputs and Outputs </h4><br>  For the majority of interviewed business angels, the quality of the team is more important than the project idea, and even how exactly it turned out to be embodied in the product prototype.  ‚ÄúIf I do not trust the founders or they are unpleasant to me as people, I don‚Äôt invest, no matter how attractive the project is,‚Äù admits Julian Zegelman. <br><br>  Most business angels surveyed by Firrma do not have a single exit for the last year, only a few have managed to sell their share in 1‚Äì2 startups.  For all the time that business angels work, most of them have no more than 2-3 exits, or none at all. <br><br><h4>  Top 7 Most Active Business Angels </h4><br><br><h4>  1.
