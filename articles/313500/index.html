My main customers do not have a large flow of clients (real estate, cars) from their sites, so for them every call or letter is really important.  Calls are the main criteria for a successful advertising campaign, because  It is easier to ‚Äúcatch‚Äù a buyer during a telephone conversation than by placing requests on the site, even with very high-quality direct mail or other feedback options. <br><br>  One of the tasks was to search for a tool that would allow to organize an advertising campaign in such a way that the bet was placed specifically on receiving calls and a transparent assessment of their quality.  As a result, one of the authors of this service came to me myself.  We are still at the stage of studying the service and the contract, but with you I can not share a review and a specific example of results from the real estate industry. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  In fact, <a href="http://marketcall.ru/">MarketCall.ru</a> is an affiliate <a href="http://marketcall.ru/">program</a> .  Webmasters place advertising information on their resources and earn money for targeted calls.  I did not find any <a href="http://ringpartner.com/">analogs</a> in Runet, but there are already representatives in the Western markets: <a href="http://ringpartner.com/">RingPatner</a> , <a href="https://www.invoca.com/">Invoca</a> (and here you can watch the video: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCLQwNQFnN1OV1ACnlXICPKw">https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCLQwNQFnN1OV1ACnlXICPKw</a> ) and <a href="http://www.callmarketplace.com/">CallMarketPlace</a> .

      According to the service representative, the total capitalization of the Western market Pay Per Call is calculated in billions of dollars.  Probably, we will eventually come to the same, given that MarketCall has been working for only a year and has already become a ‚Äúplus‚Äù. <br><br>  There are two types of users in the service - webmasters and advertisers.  Consider each one of them. <br><br><h2>  Advertiser </h2><br>  Steps to work with the campaign: <br><ul><li>  We conclude an agreement where the parameters of the target call and its cost are stated (duration, time of day, etc.) </li><li>  We provide promotional materials in the form of landings, banners, text-graphic blocks, xml feeds and key phrases, so that our partners have quality materials for work </li><li>  Run </li><li>  We listen to calls received from webmaster resources </li><li>  We approve or reject the call (looking ahead, there is an internal dispute resolution system + antifraud) </li><li>  Timely replenish the balance of the personal account within the system </li></ul><br><br>  At the time of launch, webmasters familiarize themselves with the advertiser‚Äôs offer (offer) and start work by creating a program.  The program is a binding of the number rented by the Webmaster to the advertiser number.  As a result, all calls that attracted webmaster will be displayed in the system.  The main criteria for choosing an offer partner are: EPCw (the ratio of the total number of calls to Offer to the amount of earnings of webmasters for 10 days of work), the percentage of approved (key) calls, the cost of the target call and the time at which the advertiser is ready to receive calls. <br><br>  This is how the Webmaster Offer sees in the MarketCall system: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/e1c/550/80b/e1c55080b771498dbe49c4b0aa9d4721.png"><br><br>  Advertisers in their personal account can listen to calls, analyze what time they call more often, how much money has been sold in a specified time.  In general, this is exactly what I was looking for. <br><br>  Statistics of calls to the LC of the Advertiser: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/94d/667/ad2/94d667ad29264e8dbfc0cc6748e6403d.png"><br><br>  Statistics by the hour, by the day of the week and the duration of the conversation in the LC of the Advertiser: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/bc1/b02/2bd/bc1b022bd73e46f589406b65535ed44b.png"><br><br><h2>  Webmaster </h2><br>  For webmasters, the system provides a module for renting numbers, Call-Tracking, callback widgets, recording telephone conversations, designers for generating one-page adaptive landing pages ‚Äî that is,  minimum set for semi-automatic creation of advertising campaigns. <br><br>  Displaying the MarketCall callback widget on a typical landing page: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/7d2/9a0/61f/7d29a061f8954d1b9670af8a3db15045.png"><br><br>  The webmaster can put a callback widget on his resources using the Html code: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/e15/b8e/927/e15b8e9271b24f24bac1e1ca09087266.png"><br><br>  The webmaster has the opportunity to rent flagship numbers in areas 495, 499, 812 (St. Petersburg), 8,800 for a small rent.  It is also possible to take numbers 958 for free: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/4e8/c15/cbb/4e8c15cbba4b49f2b1665df1368d81d9.png"><br><br>  The Webmaster has the opportunity to analyze conversion and profit in your personal account: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/3a3/225/9c1/3a32259c116449228b72cae9f1bfffc2.png"><br><br>  With the settings and capabilities, I think everything is clear, so below is the promised example with pictures. <br><br><h2>  Example from authors with results </h2><br>  The client is a major developer of residential complexes in Moscow and the Moscow region near the Moscow Ring Road.  The offer for an economy class residential complex was launched at the end of July and is still being successfully advertised. <br><br>  The client has never come across CPA networks and lead generation.  Naturally, it attracted payment only for targeted calls to potential customers.  At the same time, branding in the form of traffic, additional landings, banners on thematic portals, got him a bonus.  The client agreed to pay for the call 1 800 rubles (according to my data, the average cost of a call in the network on all advertising channels from 2 500 rubles to 15 000 rubles). <br><br>  One moment in attracting traffic by the webmaster is that he himself evaluates the profitability of a particular channel of attraction and, in the case of positive testing, scales the source.  Those.  having bought the position of the banner on the thematic portal, the webmaster provides the landing with traffic, for which the client does not pay.  But in case of incoming calls from this channel, the advertiser will be ready to pay for calls. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/664/17b/0f3/66417b0f36754309b28d604003a916b6.png"><br><br>  The target call parameters were as follows: <br><ul><li>  The duration of the conversation must be at least 60 seconds.  This is due to the presence of a voice greeting and good call handling by call center staff.  A manager at the other end of the wire needs 30 seconds to obtain the necessary information on a potential client. </li><li>  Calls are accepted from Monday to Sunday, from 09:00 to 21:00 in accordance with the mode of operation of the sales department. </li><li>  During the conversation should be made consultation with the sales department.  The client must voice the name of the LCD and show interest in buying an apartment.  This was the immediate requirement of the Advertiser, as stated in the rules of the Offer. </li></ul><br><br>  The types of call parameters are regulated by the system, the advertiser simply chose acceptable values: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/29c/e8f/81b/29ce8f81beb54ec3b7fa1dd65b680623.png"><br><br>  Hold is the period when the advertiser can reject the call, indicating the reason. <br><br>  Before launching Offfer, the developer sent good creatives.  On banners of various sizes, space was allocated for a phone number, and depending on the Webmaster who works with Offer, the system replaces the number itself with the one you need. <br><br>  An example of an active offer banner: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/3b3/03b/cc9/3b303bcc979e4554be37df604f2ffb2f.png"><br><br>  In addition to banners, a number of other promotional materials (landings, teaser blocks, and etc.) were agreed.  Basically, the cost of apartments, the actual program of loyalty of the developer, the availability of mortgage programs, installments, infrastructure features and images used in the webmasters' advertising campaign are negotiated. <br><br>  Agreed materials TGB (text-graphic block) on Offer: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/633/839/5f8/6338395f80ba4d85837fe655799fb370.png"><br><br>  At this preparatory work with the Offer completed.  Webmasters had access to it, and after a while the client began to receive calls. <br><br>  During the first month of operation (August), the client received 370 calls, of which 162 were recognized as targeted. <br><br>  Call statistics for August by Offer in Advertiser‚Äôs personal account: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/44e/1fb/c89/44e1fbc8902f43c9b7e25a2239b76a8f.png"><br><br>  As can be seen from the screenshot, the client willingly confirmed calls from those falling to the hold, i.e.  pass all the filters of the system, and therefore potentially target. <br><br>  There is an interesting point: if you pay attention to the ratio of non-target calls to the total number, you can see that there were 18 calls in the ‚ÄúProcessed‚Äù Status. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/aa7/c68/f6a/aa7c68f6a54846d3ae92d49dbe3865e9.png"><br>  This means that people called during off-hours sales.  The main causes of such calls: <br><ul><li>  the activity of the webmaster's advertising campaign during the off time of the Offer; </li><li>  Webmaster‚Äôs use of a bulletin board where the ad runs 24 hours a day; </li><li>  the caller did not pay attention to the mode of the sales department </li></ul><br><br>  If the Webmaster believes that the target call has not been confirmed or does not agree with the rejection, he may appeal (in the example it is 2 days).  This feature is very popular. <br><br>  An example of how a webmaster challenged an advertiser‚Äôs decision in its favor: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/26f/edc/4cd/26fedc4cd0e24c91bf414cb1694c99b5.png"><br><br>  The MarketCall functionality includes an anti-fraud system, which allows you to filter out stranded calls.  Anti-fraud discovered 9 wound-up calls during this period, all of them came from one partner who was safely banned from freezing all of his funds.  This money, of course, was returned to the client. <br><br>  Some principles of the Anti-fraud: <br><ul><li>  Calls were made from one number to several Offers with a big difference in price, class and geography. </li><li>  The same person is represented by different names. </li><li>  Calls from similar numbers.  When in the call flow the difference in the numbers is one or two digits and there are many such calls from one partner, then there is a possibility that these numbers were purchased at the same time. </li><li>  Detect motivated traffic.  Hiring people to make calls for a certain reward. </li><li>  Detection of deliberate understatement of the cost in the campaign of the Webmaster. </li><li>  High conversion.  Suspicious Webmasters are those with a CR above 35%. </li></ul><br><br>  Also calls with a non-unique status are recorded and not paid.  This means that the user has repeatedly called the Offer, and his first potentially targeted appeal already has hold status, or this call has already been confirmed. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/5fe/1e9/439/5fe1e9439ca44963900567e35c81898a.png"><br><br>  At the request of the client, we analyzed the sources of calls from our partners and found out that the most calls were attracted by the work with contextual advertising of Yandex and Goolge (47%).  The partner‚Äôs average ROI was 250%; we‚Äôll tell you more about this in another material.  On the second place is the bulletin board (38%, most often it is Avito, CIAN and Yandex. Real estate).  Social networks are lit up, but only slightly - only 9%. <br><br>  The data was collected by requesting promotional materials from partners who worked with Offer in August.  Also, the types of traffic used by the partners indicate themselves. <br><br>  Each line is a program created with the specified sources of calls: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/69c/f18/e0d/69cf18e0d2654474b5f222cc246bdfc3.png"><br><br>  As a result, for the month of work, MarketCall attracted the client 162 targeted appeals for buying an apartment. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/7c7/1cc/9af/7c71cc9afd7f4b37a5f1c9f8d9dc356c.png"><br><br>  It became interesting to us how these calls were converted further down the funnel.  We asked the client for the results of his work for August.  Usually, developers do not share such information, but in our case an exception was made.  We received data that 75.9% of people who called from advertising of our partners picked up the phone when they were called again by the developer.  22 apartments were shown, which is approximately 13.5% of the number of calls purchased. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/8b1/cf9/a05/8b1cf9a05c1e4f3282249249c4f0484d.png"><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/498/20b/83d/49820b83d28843f6bb1360dedc361b32.png"><br><br>  Since the start of the Offer, the Advertiser, having seen a significant advantage of the system, has increased the list of Offers to 10 positions.  The client is satisfied - it means that we are doing everything correctly. <br><br>  Currently, companies from the areas of car and real estate sales and the medical sector have already optimized their activities.  In testing mode, Offers in the field of legal advice are launched. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/313500/">https://habr.com/ru/post/313500/</a></p>
