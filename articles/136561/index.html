  <section class="page js-page"><h1>System administrators. What are they?</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  In this article I would like to talk about the types of personality found in the IT industry.  The idea to write this text appeared after I analyzed the personal qualities of those people who I met, and with whom I had to work.  Mostly this system administrators and those.  Directors of IT departments.  But then I will only talk about system administrators. <br><br>  So, I selected 5 main types of system administrators.  Go. <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  1. <u>PROFI</u> .  These people have a large baggage of theoretical and practical knowledge, most of the time they spend on work.  To be more precise, they practically do not break away from the monitor, forgetting such words as ‚Äúlunch‚Äù and ‚Äúsix evenings‚Äù.  Most of the small, already mastered tasks they assign to someone.  Do not tolerate monotony in the work.  When talking with colleagues or other staff, the basis of communication is brevity.  Wait from such an employee of the council (if he did not ask) is impossible.  Tasks set as clearly and concisely as possible.  They do not linger for more than 2‚Äì3 years in one place, because they find a more promising place (although sometimes it happens that they are satisfied with sn, and they sit for a long time).  I met such a character, his peculiarity was that he came to the office at exactly 9 am, and left not earlier than 11 pm, he hung up twice a week until half past one in the night.  Present like this?  And this is for all that, this is not a wild mythical admin with glasses and an old sweater tucked into jeans, but an ordinary person with his wife and small child.

      2. <u>Hungry</u> .  These guys often utter the phrase - "And let's ...".  Many are interested and ask, tell themselves, if not even asked.  There are hundreds of ideas, thoughts and projects in their heads, most of which are being implemented.  At whatever step of the career would not be such an administrator, he communicates on an equal footing with the boss and with enikeem.  They love the initiative among colleagues, they communicate with such people more.  Listen to a bunch of webinars and read books.  Constantly developing, but at the same time I have an interest in the stages completed.  Being engaged in setting up Cisco can easily be distracted by the installation of a non-installable driver for vidyuhi, and until they win they will not be left behind.  Do not sit in place.  Such guys work will never end - there is always something you can automate, reinstall or implement.  If this falls, you certainly need to make contact. <br><br>  3. <u>PASSIVE</u> .  They consider themselves successful administrators under the condition that ‚Äúnothing has fallen today, films have soared all day‚Äù.  If they call this and say that the router dies, they will not undertake to solve the problem until the poor fellow dies completely.  The basis of the workflow is having a problem at a particular point in time.  Like, if nobody calls me now and everything seems to be working, then everything is OK.  Such admins cause sincere astonishment of thirsty and ridicule from the Pros. <br><br>  4. <u>SEDNYAKI</u> .  Mediocre administrators.  Self-education is engaged at a rate much lower than the thirsty, and they are not passive.  Help in solving almost all problems.  As a rule, they know the most about the company and its employees.  Tasks solve no faster than they are received.  During working hours they can look through sites, read, listen to music.  They work in one place for quite a long time and do not like any changes.  The main quality is the stability and hardness of knowledge. <br><br>  5. <u>BELIEVED PEDANTS</u> .  I intentionally want to write about this type in the last place, because I consider this type to be the worst of all I have noticed.  So.  The classic CONVINCED PEDENT is the admin who is sincerely confident that he can make the user cooler than anyone else does.  Inveterate IT egoists.  They consider themselves above what to explain to a beginner how to share a folder.  Avoid communication with those who do not fit their level of knowledge.  They work slowly and negatively to all external stimuli, they can tolerate the intrusiveness of the manager who called, but for newbies administrators it‚Äôs better not to communicate with such.  They can not remember how they themselves studied administration.  They believe that all of the knowledge was originally at the current level.  Often they will smack at the address of MEDIODS, but they avoid communication with the PROS. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/136561/">https://habr.com/ru/post/136561/</a></p>
