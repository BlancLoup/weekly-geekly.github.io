      In fact, a person has much more feelings reflecting objective reality, and you have long guessed it. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  So, let's try to make an expanded list of feelings and those kinds of sensitivity that exist in our body. <br><br><ol><li>  Vision <br></li><li>  Hearing <br></li><li>  Sense of smell <br></li><li>  Touch <br><ul><li>  2D spatial feeling <br></li><li>  Discriminatory sensitivity <br></li><li>  Feeling pressure <br></li></ul></li><li>  Taste <br></li><li>  Joint and muscular feeling <br></li><li>  Vibration sensitivity <br></li><li>  Vestibular apparatus <br><ul><li>  Sense of balance <br></li><li>  Head orientation relative to gravity <br></li><li>  Sense of acceleration <br></li></ul></li><li>  Pain sensitivity <br></li><li>  Temperature sensitivity <br></li></ol><br><br>  And these are only those feelings that can clearly be recognized consciously!  Far from the full range of feelings, but enough to smash the myth of the five senses to pieces. <br><br>  Moreover, according to our body, the main feeling, under which our brain is sharpened, is far from being a sight.  When comparing the total thickness of the nerve fibers of the optic nerve with the total thickness of the conductive fibers of deep sensitivity, it turns out that the optic nerves are about 2 times thinner. <br><br>  Deep sensitivity (joint-muscular feeling, vibration sensitivity and feeling of pressure on the support) gives 4 times more information (the conductor cross-sectional area is proportional to the square of the thickness) than the widespread role of vision! <br><br>  The myth of the five feelings is a difficult legacy of the Christian worldview, which separates the mortal body from the spiritual reality.  Ignoring other feelings in our culture leads to widespread postural disorders, chronic muscle clamps and chronic pain from the inability to properly use your body. <br><br>  By virtue of education, concentrating our attention outside (and the ‚Äústandard‚Äù 5 feelings relate to the reality of the external world), we turn off the conscious perception of inner reality. <br><br>  <b>What is fraught with such a bias?</b> <br><br>  <b>First</b> , maintaining the quality of movement and posture is relegated to automatic responses.  Without conscious control, these reactions impoverish the repertoire of movements, leading to the consolidation of habitual posture and facial expressions.  Over time, chronic muscle clamps lead to chronic pain.  Painkillers take the first position in the lists of the most popular drugs in pharmacies.  It comes to aphorisms like: ‚ÄúIf after 40 years nothing hurts you, then you are already in paradise‚Äù ... <br><br>  <b>Secondly</b> , a person is detached from the reality of what is happening here and now.  The body is not in the past or the future, it is only in the present.  Conscious attention to the processes occurring in the body creates an anchor that allows you to start living here and now, where sensual reality creates the maximum satisfaction from life. <br><br>  <b>Thirdly</b> , a person without an anchor of the sensations of his body, poorly understands his inner needs and often goes about the external influences imposed by the environment.  Achieving not your goals brings a lot of disappointment and a little joy. <br><br>  <b>Recall the most joyous moments of</b> your life, and relate to the extended list of feelings.  Remember the delight of the carousel and roller coaster.  Melting indulgence from professional relaxing massage.  Internal composure and euphoria during the acceleration of a powerful machine.  Interest and excitement when jumping from stone to stone on the beach.  Weightlessness while sailing.  The contrast of heat and cold during bath procedures ... <br><br>  Relying only on part of the senses, it is impossible to be a complete person.  Holistic people are the same as everyone else, they just once were able to feel something inside themselves. <br><br>  <b>Is it easy to regain a sense of self?</b>  - It is relatively easy if your beliefs allow you to distract from external reality and take care of yourself.  To get started, try a few minutes a day to pay attention to the points of support of the body, as the body changes its support when moving, sitting, lying. <br><br>  <b>PS</b> More lessons on the development of deep types of sensitivity can be found in my series of articles on Hiktaimes on upper extremity tunnel syndromes.  You can start with the <a href="https://geektimes.ru/post/283006/">second article</a> . <br><br>  <b>PPS</b> Regarding the link - it leads to a zahabrennuy article on Giktayms about removing stress from the shoulders, 20K + views, 231 rooms in favorites.  The method is verified by users of Hiktaimes on themselves.  No user was hurt. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/399819/">https://habr.com/ru/post/399819/</a></p>
