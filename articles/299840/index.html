  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Personnel changes in the largest Russian IT and media companies in two weeks</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  The past two weeks (March 21-April 3) were not oversaturated with personnel changes.  Despite the fact that there were few changes in the staff of the largest Russian IT companies and media resources, they attracted public attention. <br><br>  Someone managed to enter the same river twice.  Someone now occupies two positions, but by virtue of his boundless modesty he denied everything to the last.  Someone became a pioneer in a position that had not existed in the company before. <br><br>  And someone patiently watched as the term of his employment contract expired and, as a reward for his patience, he received ... his release from office.
