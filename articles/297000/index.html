  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Performance Evaluation Review</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Surely everyone who has worked in a more or less large company has come across a situation when they have to communicate with their immediate superiors and prove their ‚Äúusefulness‚Äù in the company.  And already on the basis of HOW you present yourself, you will be offered (or you will ask for) promotion in the form of an increase in salary or growth on the career ladder (or both). <br><br>  It is clear that often your promotion depends largely on the financial capacity of the company (project) at the moment, on the success of the project, on the current situation of the company in the market, on the need to sell staff more expensive to the customer (and here your position will play a role) and many other factors.  BUT, no wonder I said more or less large companies.  After all, when the number of direct beneficiaries becomes more than 10 people, then, from the point of view of the manager, it is very difficult to assess the contribution of each to the common cause.  And here it is very important how you show yourself at a rally with the boss. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  There are many names for such a rally, but let us dwell on the most well-known and his name - <i>Performance Evaluation Meeting (Review)</i> , in the common people eval. <br><br>  So, exactly how you put yourself in a good light for you in the eyes of the authorities on the Eval can sometimes play a key role in your career growth.  And my main point at this stage, which I want to convey, that preparing for the evaluation review is very high quality and meticulous. 
      <br>

      In his practice, he has repeatedly noted that the higher a person is in a position, the more carefully he prepares for a rally. <br><br>  Before I proceed directly to some advice, I would like to share good practice that we have recently introduced at work.  And her name is <i>Performance Evaluation Essay</i> .  Yes, it is an essay that represents your vision of the following aspects of the work: <br>  - what have you achieved since the previous review <br>  - what problems and interesting problems it was possible to solve and how successful it was <br>  - what goals were set before you by the authorities and, accordingly, the results <br>  - what goals did you set for yourself and what are the achievements <br>  - what do you think you are doing wrong and what should be changed <br>  - describe any other aspects of your work that seem important to you <br><br>  You send a letter with all of the above to your manager and this helps you to communicate with him on the Eval already more substantively and to focus attention on some specific things.  And not to exchange common phrases from the category ‚ÄúI will try,‚Äù ‚Äúit is necessary to pay more attention to basic knowledge,‚Äù etc. <br><br>  The important point in writing an essay is that the format should be arbitrary.  Since there is no need to invent any templates.  Let the person, as he wishes, describe his achievements, wishes, comments in an acceptable form.  The introduction of any kind of restrictions will lead to the fact that employees will be less active in preparing essays and in the end, everything will turn into a bureaucratic preparation of a template report.  And this can not be allowed.  After all, we are waiting for openness in the conversation between the boss and the subordinate. <br><br>  Even with the free form of expressing their ideas, many do so with reluctance, which is the main mistake.  As one who wants to grow and develop, he must know where he is going and what he needs in order to achieve goals.  And it is an active position that will help in this matter.  After all, being a passive observer, you never know why the salary is not growing, what you do wrong, what needs to be changed, what to improve. <br><br>  There are three main questions that an employee should know when he answers during an evala: <br>  - what am I doing well <br>  - what should i stop doing <br>  - what should i start doing <br>  Based on these questions, a dialogue should be built between you and the manager. <br><br>  Continuing on the format of the essay, I would like to say that it could be anything - a letter with theses, a printout of your time report to show how much you work, and anything else.  There was a case in my experience when a person made a video with his impressions, achievements, expectations from work and gave the video to his manager.  What actually pleased him.  After all, agree nicely when a person loves his work, does it with pleasure and looks a little wider than just setting a specific task.  This is what we want to achieve by holding such meetings - to understand what a person expects from a company and in every possible way to help him in solving his problems, problems, etc. <br><br>  Fidbek on your work will allow you to conduct a more useful meeting, balance the assessment of you, point out the problem areas, form your future development plan.  IT IS IMPORTANT TO DO EVERYTHING TO BE HEARD. <br><br>  The most important thing in all this is to understand what are you really waiting for.  Who do you see yourself in the future - in this company or possibly outside.  This will help you determine your priorities and course. <br><br>  Let it not be so lyrical, but still - if you have a goal to become a director after two years, then you must live with it and move in that direction today. <br><br>  <b>Key tips for preparing an essay:</b> <br>  1. <i>Open conversation</i> .  You should not be shy - no one will praise you except yourself, and accordingly there will be no reason to increase your position or salary unless you yourself take an active part in it.  We must always defend their views and principles.  Silence and inaction is an irrevocable road to nowhere. <br><br>  Even if, for example, your team leader wrote a good review about you, or the manager himself has a very good impression of your work, you still need to lay out the facts confirming your services with fire in your eyes and foaming at the mouth. <br><br>  It happened to me quite a bit to see situations when a person is very sensible and bears a huge profit to the project, but because of his modesty, passivity gets an order of magnitude less than any ‚Äúmiddle peasants‚Äù, but who are more actively defending their position. <br><br>  You have to understand that 15 more people want this promotion and you have to prove that you deserve it. <br><br>  Highlight your strengths.  Perhaps now you are just a tester, but good interpersonal skills, ability to resolve conflicts, sincerity will help you to become a leader in the future.  But on these strengths of your personality in no case should not be silent and expect to be noticed. <br><br>  2. <i>Objectivity</i> .  Self-esteem is certainly good, but be extremely objective in relation to yourself.  You need to evaluate yourself by the results of your own work.  You can work badly, you can just work, and you can work effectively.  The fact that an employee is never late for work and always comes fresh after a corporate party does not mean that in his person the company has acquired a valuable frame that will give a new qualitative impetus for its development.  You should know the answer to one simple question - what did the company receive as a result of cooperation with you !? <br><br>  Achievements must be measurable.  For example, an increase in the client base by a certain number of times, or a reduction in costs by so many percent, some innovations, or a proposal to optimize a process.  Difficulties with the formulation of the answer to this item can be a warning signal for you and an incentive to review your attitude to work as such. <br><br>  3. Conciseness.  When presenting your thoughts in an essay, no one will read a book about how good you are!  Everything will end on the second page of your fairy tale.  A4 pages with head enough for a description of all your success and hotelok. <br>  Let it not be a paper version, but an oral dialogue - all the same, you should not overload the interlocutor with tons of information.  Ultimately, transfusion from empty to empty will begin to annoy despite being essentially right. <br><br>  4. <i>Self-criticism</i> .  Do not be afraid to criticize yourself.  This allows you to understand that you are aware of your mistakes and are working in the indicated direction. <br><br>  By the way, most men are prone to high self-esteem and just self-criticism will help to lower the bar of their own selfishness a little and see a more approximate to the truth state of affairs. <br><br>  Even if the conversation with the manager takes place in some other format, you should always have a piece of paper with key aspects of your activity.  Nerves, excitement - something important can fly out of my head.  And how can you not be nervous if you decide what position to hold and what salary to live on? <br><br>  Even if you are well prepared, it is still far from a fact that you will be heard and all the suggestions and suggestions will immediately take effect.  But do not give up!  In any case, you are on the right track.  Rome was not built in a day either.  You should continue in the same vein and the ultimate goal will be achieved. <br><br>  <b>Try and fail to try!</b> <br><br>  Successes in all your undertakings! </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/297000/">https://habr.com/ru/post/297000/</a></p>
