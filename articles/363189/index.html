  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Wearable device concept</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  This cry of the soul is published in order to draw the attention of interested people to the possible development vector of wearable electronics.  I offer my vision of the development of these devices and in fact agree with the concept outlined by one science fiction writer (mentioned in the material). <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/2cc/a85/c41/2cca85c419094b9eac955b4c9eab62fd.png" alt="image"><br><br>  Who is interested in my nonsense, welcome under the cat. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Not so long ago, some ten years ago, we could not imagine how mobile equipment and mobile devices would develop.  I remember the first PDA, bluetooth connection with the phone to gain access to the network, communicators on windows mobile.  Against that background, the iPhone that came out after was a space rocket.  One of the last communicators BC (before the era of iOS and Android) is still in the closet.  The battery is charged at 50%, a piece of paper is laid between the contacts of the phone and the battery in order to avoid discharge.  I will store as much as I can, the device is already almost a dinosaur.  It would be necessary to fill the original firmware as long as possible.

      But this is the lyrics.  Devices and operating systems developed at a rapid pace and continue to do so.  New functions are added, iron becomes more powerful.  Unfortunately, screen sizes on phones are growing.  Somehow unnoticed, from the clear separation of "communicator, phone, smartphone" we returned to the phone.  The smartphone is already rather an additional word, if you need to clarify the capabilities of the phone.  And so they are all phones now.  Appeared over-the-phone short-plates.  The niche of these devices is highly controversial.  And, finally, timid attempts to make additional smart devices began to appear, and the clock boom has recently begun. <br><br>  I would like to talk about the future of these systems.  Just want to say, behind the smart watch is only marketing.  The technological component is given a place somewhere there, just to work.  What can a smart watch?  Show notifications, sometimes reply to messages, live for about a day.  The concept of managing these devices, their autonomy and purpose is unclear.  I will explain.  Such a clock is stupid to position for people of those professions and hobbies that force them to be separated from civilization for some time.  The socket is needed for hours, the connection to the Internet.  That is, travelers, rescuers and the like in the passage.  Maybe then their niche office laborers?  Again, no.  Office man sits surrounded by technology.  One, two, or even more phones.  Computer or laptop with communication programs.  Does he really need reminders and notifications every second that someone likes his photo with a cat?  I often see something else, people turn off personal phones or switch to quiet mode so as not to be distracted from work.  There remains a niche of geeks, for whom this watch is just a toy. <br><br>  What would a wearable world look like?  The concept was best described by science fiction writer Andrzej Yasinsky in his ‚ÄúNick‚Äù series.  There is such a computer, the ‚ÄúSmart Boy‚Äù, which is a bracelet and very skillfully uses peripheral devices.  There is also an interesting computer mounted in the belt buckle.  It's called buddy comp.  Information output is carried out on the lenses inserted into the eye.  But who prevents to bring glasses to the inner surface of glasses?  Technological level already allows you to create something similar.  I guess the guys from Google and Apple should have read the works of this science fiction writer.  He actually developed the concept of wearable devices. <br><br>  So, the general concept is as follows.  There is a box the size of a smartphone.  No screen, with a SIM card slot, memory card.  With charging connectors.  Main unit.  There are peripherals such as a clock, a TV, a monitor (now it‚Äôs almost the same with a TV), a headset, etc.  And the control panel in which the battery, the screen (whatever you wish), the processor for processing audio and video stream. <br><br>  This remote and will be the equivalent of today's smartphone.  Only it will be cheap, it will not be a pity to lose it, because all data is stored on one device, mostly.  And all the peripherals (remote, clock, etc.) are nothing more than a wireless monitor.  Access terminal  I came home, threw the main device on charging, turned on the telly from the terminal-console and on the big screen you do everything you need.  The main device is charging, so you can walk around the house in the communication zone with the remote control.  Need a tablet?  Took the right size of the terminal, connect and use. <br><br>  This approach has both advantages and disadvantages.  Plus the fact that peripherals are cheaper.  They do not need memory, communication modules of various types (except the communication module with the main device), SIM card modules, memory cards, etc.  It's not scary to lose such a device, since there is no data on it.  In case of failure, it is easy to replace.  The physical dimensions of the devices decrease, the service life of a single charge increases, since they do not need to constantly go online and synchronize data. <br><br>  The downside is that the main device will have to be controlled and not lost.  Although in the case of normal data protection and encryption, the risk of damage is minimal in the case of data synchronization with the cloud. <br><br>  This concept is quite workable.  For example, Android has almost grown to adult axes.  With programs, you can perform a very wide range of tasks, and the basic needs of most users are covered by 90%. <br><br>  In the creep of this says another moment.  Many have heard about Google Glass?  But the device could work differently.  Why should the device be independent if the smartphone is in your pocket and can take on computational functions and processing.  The task of the glasses in this situation is to be a video camera, a headset and display information on the inner surface of the glass.  And the battery will be less needed and glasses will be easier and more convenient. <br><br>  The current situation is due to close marketers.  They have a very peculiar view of things.  The bulk of their clients perceives any nonsense of the camera type for selfies with a bang.  But if marketers create something similar to the one described above, I think their main audience will choke on saliva and gratitude from delight and desire to possess. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/363189/">https://habr.com/ru/post/363189/</a></p>
