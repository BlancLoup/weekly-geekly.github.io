  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Wearable devices? Yes, if only within yourself</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Watches, smartphones, health trackers are all in my opinion an unnecessary relic.  A tug waits ahead.  Fiction writers have already written about this.  A jerk in miniaturization, a jerk - when the device is embedded in the human body.  Information will be displayed directly into the field of view of a person with the help of either special eye lenses, or simply with connection to the optic nerve and visual parts of the brain. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h4>  Virtues </h4><br>  In a man, a small distributed, but powerful computer system, for us it is like a notebook, book, phone, camera with very high quality (everything that we see, we take pictures, and completely unnoticed - goodbye privacy), video - at least every day everything from and to.  Back at 13 and see your first kiss again?  (And if you can record and feel?).  Statuses and microblogs, visualized overhead, and visible only through a reasoned reality?  Easily.  Visible to all or only to friends.  Telepathy at the technical level.  Your favorite music and videos with the ability for other people to download or view directly while walking or traveling in public transport.  Feel free to meet that girl / boyfriend in the corner of the subway car?  Run a program analyzing movements of the pupils, body skin temperature, sweating and other changes on a person's face can tell a lot about your chances of success.  Purchases will become even easier, because you are you, how to log in if you already are the subject of authorization, can authorization be done by confirming your identity with three authorized people?  Navigation will be the easiest - the real ‚ÄúThree DE‚Äù, a big green arrow slightly ahead at the head level will tell you where to go.  Expensive advertising screens, monitors and so on will disappear.  Why, when your eyes are the best advertising space? <br><br>  The computer system will be able to collect a variety of information about your body: the number of calories, consumption, estimated time to go to the toilet, the need for water and food.  The doctor will be able to make a much more accurate diagnosis.  Pass by the cafe and do not know if there are any places there?  Cafe can set the number of tables and menus on request or just in the air before entering.  Noticed the cops in the bushes?  You can share with those who are going to meet you.  Blind headlights at a pedestrian crossing and can not see a pedestrian, a pedestrian will highlight a red silhouette.  A lot of pits on the road?  Here you have the color, the most successful, the trajectory of movement right on the road in a detour of all the pits and obstacles.  A new reincarnation of "Skype" - got up to the mirror and make a call to the interlocutor or when you call to you, he will see your avatar in sight.  Space for imagination.  Programs - for engineers and architects will be much easier to work, like any other profession.  Utility systems for police, military, corporate systems. <br><br>  The question arises - after all, everything around will be filled with flashing, sounding signs, statuses, pictures, but ... Only virtually, because it is only a display of signals from the computer in the visual sections of your brain.  There is nothing in nature, pure and calm.  Nobody forbids you to make a filter of messages, sounds, statuses, pictures.  And here you go and see only what you need, and if you wish, you can disable it altogether and not accept anything.

    <h4>  Disadvantages? </h4>  - the right to privacy will either die, or a total ban on such technologies will bring them into special structures and underground.  But this stuff. <br><br>  Huge possibilities and terrible consequences that are terrible to come up with.  So terrible that they either change the whole community, turning all our worldviews upside down, or we collectively make a decision that this was not and will not be.  Such is the prohibition of technology at the instinctive level.  New wars of the Ludists and technologists are not excluded.  Those terrible opportunities that can give control over the centers of pleasure, control over the human body, over his I, etc., will lead to armed clashes in those communities that will try to preserve the former structure of society, its former values.  Closing borders, declaring modified people outlaws, prosecution just because you are an adherent of some kind of technology.  Where there are children's games Apple and Samsung.  But who will be on the edge, will receive a new kind of power, almost absolute.  Hacker and IT specialist will become heroes and monsters of the time.  Do you still think whether to learn to program?  In that world it will be the only chance to be yourself, in that world it will be your most important ability to survive. <br><br>  Rounds: <br><h4>  Nutrition </h4><br>  It is quite possible to use the energy potential of the body (heat, blood flow, food, various inhaled gases).  The presence of a biological battery inside the body, for example, instead of an appendix, you will have such a power plant.  As a reserve wearable battery with recharging wirelessly.  Or taking pills with batteries: 1) biodegradable 2) non-biological.  They are intercepted by robots inside the body and delivered to the necessary network centers.  The network is likely to be spaced, duplicated with separate and backup power centers.  If the nerves signals can not be transmitted, it is possible to use repeaters.  Movable repeaters in the bloodstream. <br><br><h4>  Burglary protection </h4><br>  If the signals of the system do not leave the integuments of the body, then various ointments (open areas of the body), special closing clothes can serve as protection against burglary.  The second technogenic defense system against invasions of nanorobots. <br><br>  Other options? </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/363437/">https://habr.com/ru/post/363437/</a></p>
