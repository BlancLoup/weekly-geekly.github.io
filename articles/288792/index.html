How deep, in fact, is your knowledge of how each of its ingredients affects tooth enamel, gums, getting rid of bacteria?  Do you understand the fundamental difference between strontium chloride and potassium peroxide?  And exactly how the paste "protects and strengthens the tooth enamel, preventing the development of caries?".  How does Colgate paste provide protection against bacteria for 24 hours, given that the bacterial background of the teeth is restored to the original (before brushing) in 20-40 minutes regardless of which paste you used?

    <a name="habracut"></a><br>  The question is simpler.  How do you learn about who is ‚Äúcool‚Äù in the professional industry, and who is not very?  And if you do not attend professional conferences?  Are you able to distinguish a transport logistics expert from a pseudo-expert?  How will you "distinguish"?  Stalin, is he good or bad?  And Bandera?  How many of your friends knew them personally?  Or, at least, worked together with them?  No one?  On the basis of what, then, do you judge? .. <br><br>  90% of information about the world around us we draw from the so-called.  open sources: media, books, encyclopedias, recommendations from friends and professionals.  Our own experience does not tell us that the earth is round.  Our ancestors were guided by their own experience and he told them that the sun and the moon are glued to the celestial sphere and the size is quite small. <br><br>  Ah, okay, I guess I got carried away ... It's about something else.  We are surrounded by criminals.  People responsible for the degradation of society, for the fact that we are behind the whole world.  The thieves who stole our reality.  Editors, journalists, photographers, advertisers. <br><br>  The people of these professions are the creators of reality in the form in which it is perceived by the majority of the population of the country.  However, "those who create reality do not know what they are doing." <br><br><img src="http://reklamaster.com/get_image/id/9059"><br><br>  In the photo on the left - the Egyptian pyramids through the eyes of an advertising photographer.  On the right - their true appearance (shot last year).  Millions of people annually become disillusioned with guided tours of the Cairo, and in fact, at its impoverished suburb of Giza. <br><br>  Who to write about, who is worthy of attention, what events are important?  Who decides this?  Editor.  Who would the journalist interview for?  To a famous person.  What kind of person becomes famous?  The one about which the journalists write.  This is a fractal. <br><br>  Why in the news and analytical chronicles every day on the disaster, scandal and empty "revelation of a celebrity"?  And why are there no people in the news who know you in the real world?  Because the ratings.  Who will look at Vasily Petrovich, an excellent teacher of physics?  On Igor, a wonderful composer?  On Marina, exemplary mother?  The filter set by commercial journalism is simple - the amount of money.  The filter of ‚Äúsocial‚Äù journalism is the social significance of a person.  Where to get it from?  Pay money to commercial journalists.  This - klopovnik. <br><br>  And one more rhetorical question: who do children aspire to imitate, as well as adults?  Are those who are chosen by "celebrities" and "successful personalities" advertising and media workers?  A simple explanation of the degradation of society: rappers, politicians, pop gays, and show business mammary glands are more important than good engineers, outstanding teachers, and wise scientists. <br><br>  Diligence is not fashionable.  Responsibility is boring.  Reliability - for retirees.  You will not be in the right place - you will not get on TV.  I am not familiar with the right people - they will not write about you in the press.  Insolence, pressure, "kicker", ambition and the right party - the key to success and fame.  Other formulas in our country no longer exist. <br><br>  Are you a professional in your field?  Sit down and do not hang out - for a smart ride.  This is how the motivation for professionalism is destroyed.  Are you making good products?  Do you provide quality services?  98% of customers contact you a second and third time and recommend to their friends?  With a probability of 80%, you have never been written about in any media. <br><br>  We distort reality every day, intentionally and unintentionally.  And the closer to the information society, the more unreliable is our understanding of the world. <br><br>  - "You know, it seems, the story is developing in a spiral" <br>  - "Yes.  We already had everything that we could! ‚Äù <br><br>  <em>Yaroslav Trofimov, specially for ReklaMaster.com.</em> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/288792/">https://habr.com/ru/post/288792/</a></p>
