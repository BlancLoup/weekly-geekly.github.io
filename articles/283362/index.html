Many of us have a friend who puts on long-running stories.  Personally, I do not have time to follow the endless variety of new film market, but with pleasure I will burn for an hour or two at the screen, frying vegetable cutlets after a tense design week.  So what am I talking about?  Everyone would like to have a loyal friend, telling about film freshening and episodic to finally forget about the long and exhausting search for an exciting movie for Friday night.  But what if there is none? <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Since all the most "delicious" movie content produced overseas, I went in search of the application in the US Google Play.  But it turned out that everything is not so simple.  After hours of searching, I had to admit that the design and convenience of many applications leaves much to be desired.  So you have to make it yourself, I thought.  Why not base CBS, the American television and radio broadcasting network, which produces many well-known TV shows?  No sooner said than done. <br><br><h4>  Solve problems </h4><br>  So, the goal is to create the perfect assistant for finding interesting TV-content using the example of the CBS application for Android.  In order not to transform the work into redrawing beautiful pictures, ‚Äúon the shore‚Äù we will fix the tasks that the super application must be able to solve. <br><br>  <i>Task number 1.</i>  <i>Personalization.</i>  The app must know the taste of the viewer and take it into account.  For example, I adore sharp and stylish detective stories and do not digest cute comedies.  I would also like to create several accounts in order to collect interesting things for my beloved younger sister.  In the child account, she will not see the content to which she has not yet grown.  The number of categories of the channel will decrease, and from the list they will disappear, for example, ‚ÄúHorror‚Äù and ‚ÄúAction‚Äù.

      <i>Task number 2.</i>  <i>Help.</i>  The application should memorize the series number and suggest the time of the broadcast of your favorite program.  Take into account the tastes of subscribers and keep track of the most popular programs, offering to watch them first. <br><br>  <i>Task number 3.</i>  <i>Simplicity and beauty.</i>  Of course, the application must conveniently and quickly find the right one.  And at the same time - to be stylish, so that on my Nexus everything looks fresh and in the best traditions of Material Design. <br><br><h4>  So, to the point </h4><br>  What is wrong with the application in its current version?  Visually, it is too sparingly and dryly represents the whole variety of CBS programs.  From the point of view of compliance with the Google Guidelines, this is all very sad.  Neither the main platform patterns nor the important principles are used. <br>  From the point of view of convenience on the main screen, it is important for the user to find the show to his liking, without prompting.  In the existing application personalization is not provided.  Moreover, if you are a happy owner of an old gadget with a small diagonal, get ready to scroll for a long time in search of your favorite program. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/d7c/828/88c/d7c82888c2154508a149521f753c5b3d.png"><br>  <i>Screen from Google Play</i> <br><br><h4>  Start </h4><br>  The task of the main screen is to attract attention and show the most interesting.  To do this, we will take out all the navigation in the Sidebar menu, breaking it up into main sections and the gear catalog.  Everything is strictly in the case, do not distract the user with tinsel.  In accordance with the <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/company/redmadrobot/blog/252773/">principles of Material, we</a> refresh the design with the help of bright and attractive images, rich colors and contrast elements.  I suggest displaying programs based on user preferences based on the shows saved by him in the My CBS section. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/536/657/785/536657785001466d98307f6fea612259.png"><br>  <i>Redesign of the main screen and navigation</i> <br><br><h4>  The Series of my dreams </h4><br>  On the screen of the series, the application will offer to remember it, tell you about the actors, I can easily find the footage from the film and the trailer, all the awards and photos from the shooting.  And also - the time of broadcast on Live TV, to quickly find out what the diagnosis of Will Gram in the new series of the 2nd season.  With the help of the Floating Action Button, the user will save the series he likes in the section My CBS.  By default, we display all new series with the ability to select any season. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/f1e/07a/2f7/f1e07a2f739c43f0b051ac02b7ca0131.png"><br>  <i>TV series screen</i> <br><br><h4>  My cbs </h4><br>  The ideal application should provide an opportunity not only to watch your favorite movies and shows, but also make your own playlists.  So this section is the most interesting for the viewer.  All featured and watched movies and broadcasts will live here, we will divide them into My shows and Watched.  The logical solution from the point of view of convenience is to display the latest released and not yet watched episodes for each program. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/72d/7f9/33a/72d7f933ac4d464e9363ec88f8862087.png"><br>  <i>My cbs</i> <br><br><h4>  Live tv </h4><br>  Watch the new series of your favorite series without leaving your car - what could be better if you are standing in traffic?  Many of us have installed applications that help pass the time on the road, for the big city they are simply irreplaceable.  Therefore, the section is so important, it should show a TV program, remind of interesting shows and give the opportunity to watch live broadcast.  According to the principles of Material Design, I use the standard component Floating Action Button, giving the opportunity to watch live broadcast.  The application will remind you of the start time of the show with the help of Push-notifications.  For convenience, the program guide will show exactly at the time when the user enters the application, with the ability to view past and future schedules. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/7a7/ba0/afd/7a7ba0afd7d34a78875b7bc028ebae7f.png"><br>  <i>Live tv</i> <br><br><h4>  Eventually </h4><br>  On Google Play <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details%3Fid%3Dcom.cbs.app%26hl%3Dru">, the CBS app has a rating of 3.8</a> .  What did the developers not consider?  The ideal application saves time and adapts to the tastes and desires of the user, and for this it should be: <br><ul><li>  <i>Clever.</i>  Predict user desires without prompts. </li><li>  <i>Simple.</i>  Show only the desired content, helping to conveniently navigate through sections. </li><li>  <i>Modern.</i>  Use all the features and standard patterns of the platform.  Push notifications to remind you of your favorite shows, the Sidebar menu for navigation, and the Floating Action Button as an impetus for action on the screen. </li></ul><br>  I tried to take all this into account in my concept: the application received advanced logic and fresh design.  Navigation has become easier, the My CBS section remembers the most interesting, content search has become intuitive.  Have questions or ideas?  Let's discuss this :) </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/283362/">https://habr.com/ru/post/283362/</a></p>
