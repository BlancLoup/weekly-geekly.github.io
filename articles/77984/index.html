A huge role is played by the screenshots and the application icon and its description.  But given the fact that the number of programs is approaching 150'000, it is very difficult for customers not only to make their choice, but even to find the program they need.

      A fairly effective way is to provide a limited functionality of the free or Lite version so that users can at least approximately evaluate the functionality of the program and make a purchase decision.  Despite the fact that conversion (the ratio of free downloaded Lite versions to purchases of full-featured programs) is at best 10%, and usually ranges from 1% to 5%, the release of such ‚Äúlightweight‚Äù programs can bring a significant influx of buyers. <br><br>  We, TimeBom, would like to invite you, dear friends, to take part in an interesting experiment, which is to enable our Russian-speaking compatriots to use our programs from the AppStore absolutely free of charge, in exchange for receiving high ratings of programs in charts. <br><br>  You will ask why this is necessary and what does it mean? <br><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br><h4>  For foreigners the entrance to the museum is more expensive! </h4><br><br>  Our idea is to release Lite versions that only work limitedly if they were running on a device with a locale, time zone, and geolocation other than those in the former Soviet Union.  On the territory of the USSR, such programs should work as full versions.  These applications must have an identification icon in the form of a small red star in the upper right corner of the icon in order for our compatriots to recognize this program and download it. <br><br><h4>  This sweet word freebie </h4><br><br>  Modern realities are such that the level of piracy among Russian-speaking users is huge.  Torrent trackers and specialized sites distribute broken versions.  On every second iPhone, the list of programs takes not one and not two but five or six screens, and unfortunately all these programs are stolen. <br>  You can treat these users differently, but we believe that even from such a bad phenomenon, you can benefit. <br><br>  All you need to do is send this traffic to freebie lovers for absolutely free and fully functional programs for them in the American AppStore section, thereby raising the ranking of our applications in America. <br><br><h4>  Timur and his team </h4><br><br>  We want everyone to win.  Russian-speaking users, free of charge and not stooping to theft, will receive a fully working program, and developers will be able to increase the rating of their Lite versions on the developed American and European AppStore sites, which ultimately through conversion will increase sales of their products. <br><br>  As a symbol of this marketing program, we have chosen a red star.  Many are familiar with <br>  the work of Arkady Gaidar and his stories about Timur and his team - in them the pioneers marked with a small asterisk the houses of those residents who suffered during the war and tried to <br>  to the best of strength and ability to help them. <br><br>  Many of us also suffered in endless price wars and wars against piracy.  Together, we can increase sales efficiency and survive in these battles for dollars. <br><br><h4>  Where to begin? </h4><br><br>  Actually, the process has already begun, after the release of this topic, everyone who can read Russian will pay attention to the icons of free programs in the AppStore and upload them to their iPhones. <br>  If you want to try to take part in this experiment, you will need to do just a few important things: <br><br><ul><li>  add a check for a locale, time zone, installed keyboard when the program is started, or just locate the device and, if the program is running outside the USSR, limit its functionality </li><li>  add a star to the program icon </li><li>  place the program in the AppStore, limiting the territory of its distribution only to target </li><li>  markets, for example, only the United States and the United Kingdom.  It is important not to post this program in the Russian AppStore - it is senseless to raise the free program rating as no different from the paid one. </li><li>  and most importantly :) Let us know that your ‚ÄúTimur program‚Äù has been published, so that we can link to it at <a href="http://www.appmarkt.com/ru">www.appmarkt.com/ru</a> </li></ul><br><br>  Email us: apps@appmarkt.com </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/77984/">https://habr.com/ru/post/77984/</a></p>
