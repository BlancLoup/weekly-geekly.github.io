The rapid development of various types of cyber attacks has led to the fact that traditional detection systems have become helpless in their differentiation, as well as in the detection <a name="habracut"></a>  attacks such as APT, which are digital attacks aimed at certain systems over a long period of time. <br><br>  <b>APT as an example of a problem</b>

      Network intrusion detection systems (NIDS) attempt to detect unauthorized access to certain resources on the network by analyzing data traffic to detect signs of malicious activity.  Until now, they have been effective in protecting against traditional cyber attacks, such as DoS attacks, trojans, buffer overflows, etc. <br><br>  However, the rapid development of these new types of threats requires more and more advanced protection mechanisms.  Among these new attacks, it makes sense to single out and APT - large-scale attacks that are easily detected in the final stages of the attack due to sudden changes in network traffic.  But in the first stages of the attack, changes also occur in traffic that are not so easy to detect. <br><br>  NIDS have proven ineffective in preventing this type of threat because of their inability to assess planned cyber attacks, which in the initial stages are a set of isolated and harmless processes, but in the end turn out to be coordinated actions. <br><br>  <b>Early performance based detection</b> <br><br>  According to consulting firm Gartner, ‚Äúthere is a general consensus that advanced attacks are capable of circumventing traditional security management systems that are currently installed in many companies and go unnoticed in our systems for a long period of time.  Such a threat is quite real.  We are in danger, but we just don‚Äôt know about it yet. ‚Äù <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/5d0/694/767/5d06947671304fe9a80f7f23da4345d9.jpg"><br><br>  To put an end to these types of complex intrusions, there is a need to introduce new security policies based on proactive methods of prevention, which will reduce the waiting time to almost zero when unknown malicious programs are detected (for example, using machine learning techniques that monitor the system in search of unusual behavior and its blocking).  However, it is not always possible to reach the maximum level of detection of these malicious programs without false positives. <br><br>  Such a delay should be the main concern for cyber security solution manufacturers, and closing a huge window of opportunity should be their main concern.  Improving the detection of digital threats in real time means changing filtering systems and reducing response times to deter attacks. <br><br>  <b>Adaptive Defense 360 ‚Äã‚ÄãSolution</b> <br><br>  Panda Security offers a product specifically designed to close the window of malware capabilities, thanks to which criminals are able to launch zero-day attacks and implement APT in your corporate systems.  This product is <a href="https://www.cloudav.ru/intelligence-platform/">Adaptive Defense 360</a> . <br><br>  The technology integrated into this solution allows detecting and blocking malicious software by monitoring its behavior in real time.  The user will receive an immediate alert after the threat is detected, and he can be sure that the combination of machine learning algorithms and our expert analysis will eliminate false positives. <br><br>  We offer to evaluate the capabilities of <b>Adaptive Defense 360 ‚Äã‚Äãusing a demo console</b> (without the need to install the product). <br><br>  The demo console is designed to demonstrate Panda Adaptive Defense 360, which already has certain information on user settings, profiles, etc., which allows you to evaluate the console in a mode as close as possible to real work. <br><br>  <a href="http://demologin.pandasecurity.com/">Access demo console</a> <br>  <b>Access with full rights.</b> <br>  <b>Login</b> : DRUSSIAN_FEDERATION_C14@panda.com <br>  <b>Password</b> : DRUSSIAN # 123 <br><br>  <i><b>Note:</b> Reset changes in the settings of products that are made when viewing the demo console, occurs daily.</i> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/270787/">https://habr.com/ru/post/270787/</a></p>
