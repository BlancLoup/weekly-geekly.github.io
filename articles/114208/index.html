  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Gifts online, is it serious?</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  We want not just to tell the community about our project, but rather to ask and clarify for ourselves what the audience of the mobile network is.  It is clear that the audience profile is not easy to draw, but in general, you can try to evaluate the mobile network audience using the example of using our mobile application ‚Äúi Gifts‚Äù.  Why is this the question?  Because there are objective problems and they need to be solved.  And we need an answer to move on. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h5>  Problem: There is a product, where is the demand ?! </h5><br>  It‚Äôs probably worth a little to say that the background to the issue is the creation of a gift service for iOS and Android by us. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/6c6/448/c9d/6c6448c9dad1f0290a98f7d7e6661dca.png" alt="image"><br>  The purpose of the product creation was, of course, to give out the claimed product, the gift theme should evoke some feelings, and this is obvious.  In this case, there should be a comprehensive success: the product itself, and gift shops, with the offer of which we had to confront the broad masses of mobile population.  It makes no sense to hide that the success of the product determines the success of the developer (in different senses). <br>  While we were creating a cataloging system and filling the base there was some doubt about the value of those ‚Äúcute‚Äù gizmos or services that are sold here and there.  However, we still hoped that, on the contrary, both the built-in games and information exchange services, as well as price diversity, will equalize the value of the gift platform for all layers of consumers, and everyone will find a gift. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/4b9/259/1d3/4b92591d31d305a2d03b9088a6291771.png" alt="image"><br><br>  Revelation for us was the information that often the main buyers of gifts are successful and busy women who choose gifts and make a purchase solely from behind the wheel of a car.  And you know that the profile of a mobile audience built by marketers, exclusively consisting of young people, is incorrect.  No, no and NO!  The audience of the mobile network is solely determined by the level of income, and the highest level of income for the older generation.  Analysts say, ‚ÄúThe older generation is diverse, difficult to classify, and marketers often neglect them, concentrating efforts to promote goods, services and media among young people.‚Äù  But it is there, but what about us?  But our situation is completely reverse, and it reflects in general all the events of the last 30 years, but the geographical extent also affects the behavior of the mobile user. <br>  So, after publishing several versions of the application, we want to return to the community with the question "what is the true value of the product"!  If he is well suited to a representative with an average profile (set of needs), then where is he, the demand? <br><h5>  How it was. </h5><br>  There may be nothing new in the mobile aggregator, but such an advertising and information application combining game elements and standard catalogs has not yet been encountered.  And maybe it was or is, correct!

      The first version of the application was released before the New Year holidays.  Step development of the product included the integration of the directory server and its content.  The idea was to give the offer of gifts narrow, but relatively strong.  And this is understandable, because a rare mobile user will turn pages repeatedly.  Thus, the offer of material gifts, services, flowers, tourist trips, alcohol appeared. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/73a/267/2cc/73a2672cc1f47424ffd71bac600855be.png" alt="image"><br>  Then came the orders, later - built-in games, support for lists of players and ‚Äúboards‚Äù of honor. <br>  Later, the opportunity to gather friends from the network and congratulate them directly from the application. <br>  But, I must admit, none of the versions of the applications did not achieve the desired effect.  I‚Äôd just say that we didn‚Äôt give specialized advertising to the application, the development of the product was practically limited to the store.  Or maybe it's a mistake? <br><br>  We have done a lot of work on building relationships with shop uncles, this is, if not hard, then greatly stretched in time.  After this work, the product does not want to let go. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/114208/">https://habr.com/ru/post/114208/</a></p>
