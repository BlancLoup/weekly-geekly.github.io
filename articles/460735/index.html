    <hr><br><h2>  <a href="https://github.com/php-censor/php-censor">PHP Censor</a> </h2><br>  An open source CI server to help build PHP projects.  This is a fork of the <a href="https://github.com/dancryer/PHPCI">PHPCI</a> project.  PHPCI itself is still developing, but not as actively as before. <br><br>  PHP Censor can work with GitHub, GitLab, Mercurial and several others repositories.  To test the code, the tool uses the libraries Atoum, PHP Spec, Behat, Codeception.  Here is <a href="">an example</a> configuration <a href="">file</a> for the first case: <br><br><pre><code class="bash hljs"><span class="hljs-built_in"><span class="hljs-built_in">test</span></span>: atoum: args: <span class="hljs-string"><span class="hljs-string">"command line arguments go here"</span></span> config: <span class="hljs-string"><span class="hljs-string">"path to config file"</span></span> directory: <span class="hljs-string"><span class="hljs-string">"directory to run tests"</span></span> executable: <span class="hljs-string"><span class="hljs-string">"path to atoum executable"</span></span></code> </pre> <br>  <a href="https://twitter.com/4rc4n1ne/status/1071431231592640518">It is believed</a> that PHP Censor is not bad for deploying small projects, but you will have to host and configure it yourself (self-hosted).  This task is simplified by fairly detailed documentation - <a href="">it is on GitHub</a> . <br><br><hr><br><h2>  <a href="http://www.rexify.org/">Rex</a> </h2><br>  Rex is short for Remote Execution.  The system was developed by the engineer Ferenc Erki (Ferenc Erki) to automate the processes in the data center.  The work of Rex is based on Perl scripts, but knowing this language to interact with the tool is not necessary - most operations (for example, copying files) are described in the function library, and scripts often fit into ten lines.  Here is an example for logging in to multiple servers and running uptime: <br><br><pre> <code class="perl hljs"><span class="hljs-keyword"><span class="hljs-keyword">use</span></span> Rex <span class="hljs-string"><span class="hljs-string">-feature =&gt;</span></span> [<span class="hljs-string"><span class="hljs-string">'1.3'</span></span>]; user <span class="hljs-string"><span class="hljs-string">"my-user"</span></span>; password <span class="hljs-string"><span class="hljs-string">"my-password"</span></span>; group <span class="hljs-string"><span class="hljs-string">myservers =&gt;</span></span> <span class="hljs-string"><span class="hljs-string">"mywebserver"</span></span>, <span class="hljs-string"><span class="hljs-string">"mymailserver"</span></span>, <span class="hljs-string"><span class="hljs-string">"myfileserver"</span></span>; desc <span class="hljs-string"><span class="hljs-string">"Get the uptime of all servers"</span></span>; task <span class="hljs-string"><span class="hljs-string">"uptime"</span></span>, <span class="hljs-string"><span class="hljs-string">group =&gt;</span></span> <span class="hljs-string"><span class="hljs-string">"myservers"</span></span>, <span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-keyword"><span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-keyword">sub</span></span></span><span class="hljs-function"> </span></span>{ <span class="hljs-keyword"><span class="hljs-keyword">my</span></span> $output = run <span class="hljs-string"><span class="hljs-string">"uptime"</span></span>; <span class="hljs-keyword"><span class="hljs-keyword">say</span></span> $output; };</code> </pre><br>  We recommend starting your acquaintance with the tool from the <a href="http://www.rexify.org/docs/guides/start_using__r__ex.html">official guide</a> and <a href="http://www.rexify.org/docs/rex_book/index.html">e-book</a> that is currently being added. <br><br><hr><br><h2>  <a href="https://openbuildservice.org/">Open Build Service (OBS)</a> </h2><br>  It is a platform for optimizing distribution development.  Its code is open and lies in the repository on <a href="https://github.com/openSUSE/open-build-service">GitHub</a> .  The author of the tool is <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novell">Novell</a> .  She participated in the development of the SuSE distribution, and this project originally called the openSUSE Build Service.  Not surprisingly, Open Build Service is <a href="https://build.opensuse.org/">used</a> to build projects in openSUSE, Tizen and VideoLAN.  Dell, SGI and Intel also work with the tool.  But there are regular startups among regular users.  Especially for them, the authors have assembled ( <a href="https://openbuildservice.org/files/manuals/obs-admin-guide.pdf">p.10</a> ) a pre-configured <a href="https://openbuildservice.org/download/">software package</a> .  The system itself is completely free - you only have to spend money on a hosting or iron server to unwrap it. <br><br>  But for all the time of its existence, the tool has not acquired a wide community.  Although <a href="http:/www.linuxfoundation.org/node/3444">it was</a> part of the Linux Developer Network responsible for standardizing an open OS.  <a href="https://www.quora.com/What-are-the-pros-and-cons-of-Open-Build-Service-OBS">It can be difficult to</a> find the answer to an interesting question on the thematic forums.  But one of the residents of Quora noted that in the Freenode <a href="http://irc.lc/freenode/opensuse-buildservice/t4nk%40%40%40">IRC chat</a> community members respond quite willingly.  The problem of a small community is not global, since the solution of many problems is described <a href="https://openbuildservice.org/help/">in the official documentation</a> (PDF and EPUB).  You <a href="https://openbuildservice.org/help/manuals/obs-best-practices/">can also find</a> best practices for working with OBS (there are examples and cases). <br><br><hr><br><h2>  <a href="https://www.rundeck.com/open-source">Rundeck</a> </h2><br>  An open tool ( <a href="https://github.com/rundeck/rundeck/">GitHub</a> ) that automates tasks in the data center and the cloud using scripts.  Their execution is the responsibility of a special script server.  We can say that Rundeck is the ‚Äúdaughter‚Äù of the platform for managing ControlTier applications.  Rundeck separated from it in 2010 and acquired new functionality - for example, integration with Puppet, Chef, Git and Jenkins. <br><br><blockquote>  The system is used in <a href="https://www.rundeck.com/resources/case-study/disney">The Walt Disney Company</a> , <a href="https://www.rundeck.com/resources/case-study/salesforce">Salesforce</a> and <a href="https://www.rundeck.com/resources/case-study/ticketmaster">Ticketmaster</a> .  But the project is also suitable for startups.  This is due to the fact that Rundeck is distributed under the Apache v2.0 license.  The tool is quite easy to use. </blockquote><br>  The resident of Reddit, who worked with Rundeck, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/devops/comments/3szdgz/which_rundeck_equivalent_is_better/">says</a> that he solved most of the difficulties on his own.  With this, he was helped by the <a href="https://www.rundeck.com/resources">documentation and e-books</a> published by the developers. <br><br>  Also on the net you can find brief guides for setting up a tool: <br><br><ul><li>  <a href="https://www.linuxsysadmins.com/rundeck-it-automation-tool-step-by-step-installation-guide/">Walkthrough: How to Install Rundeck</a> </li><li>  <a href="https://blog.e-zest.com/easy-steps-to-create-jobs-in-rundeck">Five steps to create jobs</a> </li></ul><br><hr><br><h2>  <a href="https://www.gocd.org/">Gocd</a> </h2><br>  An open tool ( <a href="https://www.github.com/gocd">GitHub</a> ) automating control of code versions.  He was introduced in 2007 by the company <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ThoughtWorks">ThoughtWorks</a> - then the project was called Cruise. <br><br>  AutoTrader‚Äôs online auto sales resource, Ancestry genealogy service and Barclaycard credit card provider work with GoCD.  However, a quarter of users of the tool <a href="https://www.g2.com/compare/gocd-vs-jenkins">is a small business</a> . <br><br>  The popularity of the service among startups can be explained by its openness - it is distributed under the Apache v2.0 license.  At the same time, GoCD <a href="https://www.gocd.org/plugins/">has</a> plug-ins for integration with third-party software - authorization systems and cloud solutions.  True, the system is <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/devops/comments/8awjig/ci_lovers_which_ci_tool_do_you_prefer/">quite difficult</a> to master - it has a large number of operators and teams.  Also, some users complain about a bad interface and the <a href="https://amaysim.engineering/auto-scaling-build-agents-for-gocdtags-a10f12d5b77c%3Fgi%3D942a75340c3e">need to</a> configure agents to scale. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/6x/xp/ch/6xxpch0qee0quugo3zawpnbie7i.jpeg"><br>  <font color="#A9A9A9"><i>Photo - <a href="https://unsplash.com/photos/wF14k8SyGzA">Matt Wildbore</a> - Unsplash</i></font> <br><br>  If you want to try GoCD in practice, you can find <a href="https://docs.gocd.org/current/">official documentation</a> on the project website.  As a source of additional information, you can also recommend the <a href="https://www.gocd.org/blog/">GoCD developer blog</a> with <a href="https://www.gocd.org/2019/05/14/installing-configuring-gocd-gke-using-helm/">customization</a> guides. <br><br><hr><br><h2>  <a href="https://jenkins.io/">Jenkins</a> </h2><br>  Jenkins is widely known and <a href="https://opensource.com/article/18/12/cicd-tools-sysadmins">considered a</a> kind of standard in the field of CI \ CD - of course, without it this selection would not be completely complete.  The tool appeared in 2011, <a href="https://jenkins.io/blog/2011/01/11/hudsons-future/">becoming an</a> offshoot of the Hudson project from Oracle. <br><br>  Today, Jenkins <a href="https://wiki.jenkins.io/pages/viewpage.action%3FpageId%3D58001258">works</a> in NASA, Nintendo and other large organizations.  However, <a href="https://enlyft.com/tech/products/jenkins">more than 8% of</a> users fall into small groups of up to ten people.  The product is completely free and distributed <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%259B%25D0%25B8%25D1%2586%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B7%25D0%25B8%25D1%258F_MIT">under the MIT license</a> .  However, Jenkins will have to host and configure independently - it needs a dedicated server. <br><br>  For all the time of existence of the tool around it a vast community has been formed.  Users actively communicate in threads on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/jenkinsci/">Reddit</a> and <a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/%3Fnomobile%3Dtrue">Google Groups</a> .  Materials on Jenkins also regularly appear on Habr√©.  If you would like to become part of the community and start working with Jenkins, there is <a href="https://jenkins.io/doc/">official documentation</a> and <a href="https://jenkins.io/doc/book/">reference book from the developers</a> .

The first is the <a href="https://github.com/jenkinsci/configuration-as-code-plugin">Configuration as Code</a> plugin.  It makes it easy to set up Jenkins with readable APIs that are understandable even to administrators without deep knowledge of the tool.  The second is the <a href="https://jenkins-x.io/">Jenkins X</a> system for the cloud.  It accelerates the delivery of applications deployed on a large-scale IT infrastructure by automating some routine tasks. <br><br><hr><br><h2>  <a href="http://trac.buildbot.net/">Buildbot</a> </h2><br>  This is a continuous integration system for automating the build cycle and application testing.  It automatically checks the performance of the code every time any changes are made to it. <br><br>  The tool was authored by engineer Brian Warner.  Today, he was <a href="https://github.com/buildbot/botherders">replaced by the</a> initiative group Buildbot Oversight Committee, which includes six developers. <br><br>  Buildbot is <a href="https://github.com/buildbot/buildbot/wiki/SuccessStories">used</a> by projects such as LLVM, MariaDB, Blender and Dr.Web.  But it is also used in smaller projects like wxWidgets and Flathub.  The system supports all modern VCS and has flexible build settings by using Python to describe them.  The <a href="http://docs.buildbot.net/current/tutorial/tour.html">official documentation</a> and third-party tutorials will help to deal with all of them, for example, here is a short <a href="https://www.ibm.com/developerworks/library/l-buildbot/index.html">guide from IBM</a> . <br><br><hr><br>  <i>Of course, <b>these are not all</b> DevOps tools that you should pay attention to small organizations and startups.</i>  <i>Bring your favorite tools in the comments, and we will try to tell about them in one of the following materials.</i> <br><br><hr><br>  <b>What we write about in the corporate blog:</b> <br><br><ul><li>  <a href="https://blog.itglobal.com/standarty/penetration-testing-vneshnij-audit-bezopasnosti/">Penetration testing - external security audit</a> </li><li>  <a href="https://blog.itglobal.com/resheniya/netapp-max-data/">NetApp MAX DATA: Solution Overview</a> </li><li>  <a href="https://blog.itglobal.com/funkcionalnost/vmware-v-mire-kontejnerov/">A brief history of containers: from chroot to Kubernetes</a> </li><li>  <a href="https://blog.itglobal.com/bezopasnost/zashhita-ot-ddos-v-oblake-provajdera/">DDoS protection in the provider's cloud</a> </li></ul></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/460735/">https://habr.com/ru/post/460735/</a></p>
