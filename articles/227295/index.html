  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Call the nodes of the network: where to get inspiration?</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  My acquaintance with the non-functional naming of network devices began with an amusing tale.  In the computer center of the university, where I trained in my student years, servers and switches were called pet names.  One of the servers was not lucky, he got the nickname "Bobby."  He began to breathe quickly enough, and died with an enviable periodicity even after it was renamed. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/346/308/3fd/3463083fd54227e32c6a4521e1726df1.png"><br><br>  Popular wisdom says: "How do you call a <s>boat</s> server, so it <s>will float</s> and work."  Much has been written about how to call network devices so that it is easier to understand their purpose, model, and location on the network.  I will tell a little about where people scooped and draw inspiration, inventing their own names for their equipment. <a name="habracut"></a>

      One of the very popular naming schemes is Greek mythology.  And in this scheme, you can even make some kind of logic, dividing the device according to functionality.  For example, <a href="http://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%2597%25D0%25B5%25D0%25B2%25D1%2581">Zeus (Zeus)</a> - a domain controller or master server, <a href="http://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%2590%25D1%2584%25D0%25B8%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B0">Athena (Athena)</a> can be a database server, a ticket or knowledge base, <a href="http://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%2593%25D0%25B5%25D1%2580%25D0%25BC%25D0%25B5%25D1%2581">Hermes (</a> mail) or a VoIP server.  But it is better not to even think about what actions <a href="http://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%25A2%25D0%25B0%25D1%2580%25D1%2582%25D0%25B0%25D1%2580">Tartarus (Tartarus)</a> performs ... Certainly nothing good. <br><br>  Also very popular are the names of the characters of cult books, films and TV shows.  The more iconic, the more applications you can find on the Internet.  For example, "The Lord of the Rings."  For example, a common option is to call the incoming gateway connecting the internal network with the outside world, Frodo (FroDo, derived from Front Door).  Firewall can be called <a href="http://youtu.be/V4UfAL9f74I%3Ft%3D6s">Gandalf (Gandalf)</a> .  And one person even admitted his desire to call the domain controller Mordor and disable all user accounts.  Because <a href="http://lurkmore.to/One_does_not_simply_X_into_Mordor">one cannot simply enter Mordor</a> . <br><br>  Other real movie options are: Zaphod (Zaphod, ‚ÄúThe Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy‚Äù) for a server based on a dual-core processor or Cacophonix (Cacofonix, the Asterix &amp; Obelix series) for an old dot-matrix printer. <br><br>  A less entertaining, but still popular scheme is to call servers sequentially by the elements of the Periodic Table, the <a href="http://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%25A4%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B5%25D1%2582%25D0%25B8%25D1%2587%25D0%25B5%25D1%2581%25D0%25BA%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B9_%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BB%25D1%2584%25D0%25B0%25D0%25B2%25D0%25B8%25D1%2582_%25D0%2598%25D0%259A%25D0%2590%25D0%259E">phonetic alphabet</a> , the celestial bodies of the Solar System, etc.  Typically, such schemes replace trivial sequential numbering with numbers, but some people use a creative approach.  So, one person used the following scheme: <br>  Mercury (Mercury) - netbook, small and fast; <br>  Venus (Venus) - hospital with Windows, cute, but dangerous; <br>  Earth (Earth) - a laptop with Linux, the most time passes there; <br>  Mars (Mars) - Amahi server, less Venus, but much friendlier; <br>  Ceres (Ceres; a large object of the asteroid belt) is the wife‚Äôs laptop on Windows 7, therefore not a real planet; <br>  Quasar (Quasar) - a printer that constantly gives out information (not in the radio band, but still); <br>  Luna (Luna) - a smartphone, it is always there. <br><br>  The use of various geographical names (cities, countries, rivers, seas, national parks, etc.) is quite popular.  However, not always such a scheme serves to indicate the physical location of the server.  For example, one person recommends everyone use naming servers for mountains.  First, it is possible to make a separation by significance (the more important the server, the higher the mountain to call it).  Secondly, if a person has problems in the mountains, it is always the problem of the person himself.  Mountains have no problems. <br><br>  Of the rarer, but actually used options are the seven deadly sins and even the English euphemisms for vomiting.  True, in the latter case, the managers, when they noticed, were asked to urgently remove, so that customers would not accidentally see the mail headers.  Admins are not confused and found another exquisite solution that no one was suspicious, but gave them an inner reason to rejoice.  However, I will not talk about it. <br><br>  And what original names for servers or other equipment did you use? </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/227295/">https://habr.com/ru/post/227295/</a></p>
