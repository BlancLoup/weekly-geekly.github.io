And most importantly, basher.ru is an experiment, an attempt to create a ‚Äústandard‚Äù, if you want a ‚Äústandard‚Äù ... <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Let's take it in order as to the name ... <br>  Basher, unlike Bash, is something animated.  Indicates that people themselves decide what is funny and what is not.  Well, and then the association with eBasher does not give me rest =) A good word. <br>  Now I will describe the service a little, its main differences from the same bash. <br>  I will not say that the idea was taken from bash.org, and that Russian has nothing to do with itp =) This is rut.  What is bash.org, I learned much later than the Russian clone. <br>  The main difference, I hope, will be the top humor generators.  What I miss so much on the tower.  Some top "most funny" irc channels \ sites and so on.  Those.  it was always interesting to quote quotes and stsuko laugh :) however, I also really wanted to chat with the authors, hang out on channels and so forth.  But there was practically no such opportunity.  Ideally, the top humorogenitors will look like this: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/olpictures/dd7/9fe/837/dd79fe83789933a9a3dcb1d12e88ccf4.gif" width="450" height="294" hspace="10" vspace="10"><br>  Although at the moment it looks a little different ... But still they start with something =)) <br>  Further, when you refresh the page or the new approach to the project, all quotes will be highlighted that you have not seen today.  Accordingly, who passed the barrier of 10 votes on the index. <br>  In the "New 2.0" you can conveniently read all the updates.  All quotes that have not yet hit the index, i.e.  did not score 10 goals.  If similar quotes run out in the system, the user displays all quotes for which he did not vote, which he did not add to favorites, etc.  Those.  in theory, those that he has not yet read.  Roughly speaking, in the section there is always something to live. <br>  ‚ÄúThe Best‚Äù, ‚ÄúThe Abyss‚Äù, ‚ÄúRSS‚Äù, ‚ÄúSearch‚Äù - everything is like on the big brother.  But here you can add quotes only from the registered user.  Those.  if anyone can vote, users can add quotes only after registration.  Although registration is purely conditional.  No confirmations on Email and other Labuda.  Email can not even specify, then you may have problems with password recovery =)) In general, registration takes from 20 to 40 seconds.  My record time is 3 seconds. <br>  I did not complicate the registration, enter the captcha, confirmations by email and so on.  In general, probably, it is not inevitable.  However, at the moment, convenience for users at the highest.  And then, if the bots will be done and there will be too many of them - I will declare myself a social network and say that I have a number of users uuuuuuuuu =))) <br><br>  The site fully functions without javascript, i.e.  All 2.0 gadgets turn into a regular service if there is no user javascript.  It‚Äôs stupid of course, for me the user‚Äôs pictures are more likely to be turned off than scripts, but still =) <br><br>  Sverstan on a valid xHtml, tried, CSS was also validated, like RSS feeds.  Which, by the way, are a complete static, poison your RSS readers as much as you want.  nginx `do not care =)

      Each user is given a place under the "Favorites".  While it is not limited and will hardly have to limit. <br><br>  Look like that's it.  Now, actually, why I am writing all this.  I would love to hear an opinion on several points: <br><br><blockquote>  <b>Comments</b> </blockquote><br>  Need or not?  I thought for a long time but did not dare to make them.  Something tells me that it will not be that ... Although I could be wrong.  I would like to hear informed opinions on this matter. <br><br><blockquote>  <b>Elastic</b> </blockquote><br>  Tumbled rubber, but is it necessary?  Many oppose the gum, saying the texts are long uncomfortable to read.  However, quotes are quite.  My monitor works in the resolution of 1680x1050 pixels and I don‚Äôt complain ... If anyone catches eyes for some reason - write. <br><br><blockquote>  <b>Design</b> </blockquote><br>  I myself am not a designer, I noticed that on some monitors my barely gray shadows, etc. are not visible at all.  Monique set up half an hour from a friend - and it did not work to make him display the damn shadows.  I can not imagine how to deal with this. <br><br>  And also with pleasure I will listen to all comments, mistakes, omissions.  Any wishes, opinions, ideas and so on. <br>  The project is at the stage of the last testing, if everything is as usual, then closer to October I will launch advertising, let's see what comes out of an attempt to ‚Äúovebdvanolit‚Äù the old project. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/13928/">https://habr.com/ru/post/13928/</a></p>
