A week later <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2011/09/08/google-drive-pic/">,</a> real evidence began <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2011/09/08/google-drive-pic/">to appear</a> .  And earlier today, social media consultant Johannes Wiegand <a href="http://wisecom.wordpress.com/2011/09/24/is-this-the-new-google-drive/">noticed something interesting</a> during a presentation at a Google sponsored event: something that is very similar to Google Drive. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  And this is it. <br><br>  Over the last month, we were able to dig up more information about Google Drive.  First of all, it is quite real.  And it is already used inside Google.  Of course, he was also real as early as 2007 and 2008, before he was eventually killed.  But then the employees who saw and used the service agreed in conversations that it was rather shaky and not ready for release.  The new version is expected to be much better.

      As you can see in Wigand's photo (above, with important elements circled by me), Google Drive on the web will essentially be rebranded by Google Docs.  This should not be a big surprise, since Google has positioned Docs as <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2010/01/12/google-gdrive-launches-just-dont-call-it-that/">a kind of Google Drive since the beginning of 2010</a> .  The difference is that at that time, Google did not want to call it that way.  And now he wants. <br><br>  And it makes a lot more sense.  Few people use Google Docs for online storage of something other than the files they use in Docs.  Most still probably do not even know that this is possible.  Something as simple as changing the name to Google Drive should help with this.  For different folders in Google Drive there will be a new space ‚ÄúMy Google Drive‚Äù.  There will also be other tools specifically for Drive. <br><br>  But the real solution: there will also be native synchronization programs that can be installed on their different computers and mobile devices.  Yes, like Dropbox. <br><br>  It was still three or four years ago, but again, the service (codenamed Platypus) was said to be very shaky.  Now they say that it works well.  If you have a document on your computer that you want to transfer to another, you simply drag and drop it into this new Google Drive application.  Or, of course, you can do it via the web. <br><br>  We have not heard about the launch time of Google Drive, but we assume that this will happen pretty soon.  Again, Google has been using it internally right now and for some time already.  The only thing Google can wait for is Ice Cream Sandwich ‚Äî a new version of Android next month.  It may have some built-in Google Drive components (although this is just my guess).  And it seems that it will be at least part of Chrome and, more importantly, Chrome OS. <br><br>  Expect Google Drive on drive.google.com (not yet launched).  It is not yet clear how docs.google.com (the current address of Docs) will be used - perhaps as the address of a text editor application, or maybe it will just be a redirect.  It is also not clear how much space Google will allocate for this service, but presumably it will be the same as it is now in Docs, Gmail, etc. You get some (increasing) amount for free, and if you need more, you can buy it. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/129125/">https://habr.com/ru/post/129125/</a></p>
