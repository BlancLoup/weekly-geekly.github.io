      Recently (somewhere from the end of the 90s) you can really get yourself a small asterisk from the 6th to the 16th magnitude.  The number of stars that can be observed with a telescope, billions of billions, even all of them can be sold only once, then every inhabitant of the Earth can be called by his name if not a billion stars, then something like that.  So you can buy hundreds of other stars for yourself, without prejudice to others.  And so, what do businessmen offer under the proud slogan ‚Äúbuy a star‚Äù? <br><br>  You think you're really buying a star.  No, you are not buying a product, but a service to add your name to a certain catalog.  Namely: <br><ol><li>  Entry of the name of the star, catalog of astronomical bodies. </li><li>  Providing a certificate for this momentous event. </li><li>  Providing additional souvenirs. </li></ol><br>  In fact, paying from 25 - 650 euros and above (prices at the time of writing the post), you will receive a registration of your name in the catalog and certificate.  In addition, you can order (for some money) a presentation set with a transparent ball with your name and splashes of ‚Äústars‚Äù inside, a photo of your star, a certificate in metal, framed, a flash card, delivery and the most interesting <strong><em>sound of</em></strong> your star on a CD. drive. <br><br>  Probably, the merchants flew on a rocket to distant stars (to all several billions) and, imagine, having flown closer, a microphone on a long bar, like what we see in studios, is thrust out through the porthole and record the sound from the star.  You and I understand that sounds in space do not spread and it is not possible to record them from the Earth, once they are sold, it means they flew off and recorded. <br><br>  There are an uncountable number of such companies on the Internet, so for reliability you can put your name in several directories at once.  This is nothing that directories go no further, and stars of such magnitude as they ‚Äúsell‚Äù cannot be viewed with the naked eye, but you will have several certificates.  But beware of fraudsters, as they say on one of the sites of "star sellers", but it is not possible to figure out which of a large number of star sellers is <a href="http://www.caseclub.ru/articles/obman.html">cheating</a> .  Each of the sellers have some documents that confirm their right to create star catalogs. <br><br>  For those who doubt the <a href="http://journal.caseclub.ru/2008/01/05/o-nashix-zakonax/">legality of</a> such an enterprise I explain.  Entering your name into the company's catalog is completely legal, since it does not infringe upon the rights of other companies to add your name to other catalogs of the same type. <br><br>  <strong><em>Option Two: areas on the Moon, Mars, Venus.</em></strong> <br><br>  Earthlings rejoice.  Now (namely since 1980) you can buy lots on the surfaces of other planets.  Why since 1980, but because it was this year that one Dennis Hope, on the basis of American law, <strong><em>appropriated</em></strong> the moon <em>(it is unlikely he bought it from the Moon inhabitants, since the earthlings who visited the Moon, Neil Armstrong and Edwin Aldrin, do not evidence for the redemption of this territory from Lunyan)</em> and several other celestial bodies, and now sells the land plots, organizes the lunar embassy and issues lunar passports. <br><br>  Not a bad <a href="http://journal.caseclub.ru/category/biznes/">business</a> , since no one will fight for a plot on the moon (at least for now), since it is problematic to touch it, it‚Äôs not possible to fly to the moon now for the average man, but it‚Äôs already possible to stake out the plot.  Better yet, take a plot on Mars.  Mars and more, and there is no atmosphere there.  And so, what is offered for a ridiculous price of $ 150? <br><ol><li>  The document on the ownership of property.  This document formalizes your ownership rights to the purchased land.  ( <em>from the point of view of American legislation, since the world community in 1967 signed a document stating that earthlings cannot claim celestial bodies</em> ) </li><li>  Map of the surface of Mars. The <strong><em>approximate</em></strong> location of the area you purchased is marked on the map.  <em>(Indeed, that fussing is a thousand kilometers plus, a hundred kilometers minus, not the house you were going to build there)</em> </li><li>  Martian Constitution The Constitution contains the Martian laws in force and your rights regarding other owners.  (the <em>constitution was probably signed by the Martian aborigines</em> ) </li></ol><br>  You can also buy a Martian passport and currency.  When you are going to check your property, they will definitely be useful to you :) <br><br>  <strong><em>Option Three: the clouds in the property</em></strong> <br><br>  Our compatriot Vladimir Osipov, who lives in Eisk, looking at the success of Hope (the seller of the Moon), decided to become the owner of all clouds and clouds.  I started small, found a ‚Äúno-man‚Äù cloud and applied to the local police department to search for the owner.  Naturally, the owner could not be found and he decided to stake out this cloud behind him.  To start one, and then all the clouds on Earth.  Now draws up the documents.  If he succeeds, he is going to sue the enterprises whose emissions into the atmosphere pollute "his" clouds and receive compensation for it.  The only thing that the newly appeared ‚Äúowner‚Äù did not take into account was the possibility of a counterclaim, because the rain from ‚Äúhis‚Äù clouds could arrange floods and floods, for which he, as the owner, would have to answer. <br><br>  In our world, there are still a lot of things that can be ‚Äúprivatized‚Äù, for example, wind, snow or something else like that.  True, unlike the Americans, who have been successfully selling their rights to the assigned objects for a long time, our compatriot has not received a penny from this, but perhaps he has everything in the future. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/24253/">https://habr.com/ru/post/24253/</a></p>
