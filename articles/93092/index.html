Unless it is necessary to carry with itself an USB adapter. <br>  A nice feature is also the ability to automatically pinch songs with a particularly good quality to save space - 4 GB though, in general, is enough, but I would like more. <br><br><h2>  Synchronization </h2><br>  The synchronization window allows you to select genres, playlists and individual artists that will be uploaded to the player: <br><br> <a title="Habraffe.ru" href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/habraeffect/bf/c5/bfc5be3232b4fd5bb7f640e0b57b13c5.png"></a> <br><br>  The synchronization itself happens quite quickly: <br><br><img src="http://habreffect.ru/files/e8b/c7e3333c2/7.png"><br><br><h2>  Control </h2><br>  So, the music is downloaded, now I want to listen to it. <br>  This player, in addition to its size, is famous for a rather unusual control system. <br>  In the instructions, for some reason, not all combinations are given. <br><br><h4>  On and off </h4><br>  The player has three modes: the player is turned off, the player plays songs in order, and in random mode.  To move between them, simply move the switch to the desired position. <br><br>  It should be noted that after turning on the player does not hit the sound over the ears - the volume in the headphones increases gradually, just as it turns off.  The indicator will turn green, orange, or red (depending on the charge percentage) and go out in a few seconds. <br><br>  When changing the mode, the music will quietly subside at about half the volume, and a pleasant beep will be played. <br><br>  If you turn off the player, and while the music subsides, turn it on again - the player will voice the remaining battery charge in percent. <br>  As it turned out, he does not synthesize it every time - there are several ready-made samples (Battery Full, Battery 75%, and so on). <br><br><h4>  Navigation </h4><br>  The remote on the headphones has only 3 buttons - decrease and increase the volume, as well as the central button. <br>  This button is the most important: <br><ul><li>  1 click - stop or start playback </li><li>  2 clicks - next song </li><li>  3 clicks within 6 seconds after the beginning of the song - the previous song </li><li>  3 clicks - start the song first </li><li>  1 click and delay - fast forward </li><li>  2 clicks and delay - rewind </li><li>  Delay for ~ 2 seconds - the player will speak the name of the song, artist and album </li><li>  Delay for longer - the name of the song, the sound signal and the transition to playlist navigation: </li></ul>  After entering the playlist mode, the player will say ‚ÄúAll Songs‚Äù (Voice Over has been enabled in English), and then will begin to list the names of the playlists.  The music will continue to play softly in the background.  You can select playlists by pressing the volume buttons (plus - back, minus - forward).  To select a playlist, press the center button. <br><br>  I can call a significant minus the fact that there is no possibility of choosing a specific artist - i.e.  If you want to listen to one particular group, you will have to create for each individual playlist. <br><br>  Despite the seeming complexity of management, it was easy to get used to it.  After any other player, such control seems incredibly convenient - you do not need to go into your pocket to change the volume or switch the track, the hand easily falls on the remote. <br><br>  Of course, there are also disadvantages - it will be quite difficult to find a certain song - this player will hardly be liked by people who like to constantly choose which song to listen to next.  Although for them there is a good option - to make a separate playlist with your favorite songs. <br><br><h4>  Voice over </h4><br>  The names of the songs the player speaks very clearly, supports about 20 languages, <b>including Russian</b> .  Each language has its own voice. <br><br>  As it turned out, the player‚Äôs task is only to play already finished voice files - iTunes generates them for all the songs and playlists.  The files for some reason turned out to be in the WAV format - if there are many songs, then Voice Over will eat more than a dozen megabytes. <br><br><h2>  Using the player as a USB flash drive </h2><br>  The player connects and works as a regular USB flash drive, while at the same time it is available for synchronization both in iTunes and as a regular drive in My Computer. <br><br>  Speed ‚Äã‚Äãtests revealed the following: <br><br><h4>  Upload to player: </h4><br><img src="http://habreffect.ru/files/f7a/76bbc25bc/8.png"><br><br><h4>  Download from player: </h4><br><img src="http://habreffect.ru/files/0c0/78ef2af2c/9.png"><br><br>  Almost 3 (!) Times higher than upload! <br><br><h2>  Conclusions and impressions </h2><br><h4>  Pros: </h4><ol><li>  A huge plus - light, small, durable </li><li>  Convenient management </li><li>  Voice over </li><li>  Works like a flash drive </li><li>  Good sound quality for the average listener. </li></ol><h4>  Minuses: </h4><ol><li>  Lack of display - difficult to find the right song </li><li>  Non-standard connector - for use as a flash drive you need to carry an adapter </li><li>  The lack of an adapter for charging in the kit - i.e.  charge the player will only from USB.  If you want more, you will have to buy an Apple Apple standard adapter. </li><li>  Lack of support for flac (although I do not consider it a serious disadvantage with this amount of memory) </li></ol>  In general, the iPod Shuffle is a player, and nothing more, but it performs its tasks perfectly. <br><br>  The device is suitable as for an ordinary person, and for someone who is actively involved in sports - a heavy smartphone can be broken, and with a light player in a metal case, something is unlikely to happen. <br><br>  And the way to control the player makes it perplexing to look at the times when, in order to change a song, you had to get a smartphone out of your pocket or grope buttons on the body of a player from another company. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/93092/">https://habr.com/ru/post/93092/</a></p>
