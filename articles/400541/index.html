And not only in electronics, but also in the automotive industry.  It was here that was presented a powerful electric car from the company <a href="https://www.ff.com/">Faraday Future</a> .  This is an electric car FF 91, combining the features of a conventional electric car and a car class "superlux". <br><br>  The developers showed a multimedia system with entertainment for passengers, demonstrated the navigation capabilities of the vehicle, as well as an automatic parking system.  This function was demonstrated to the visitors of the exhibition, so that everyone could be convinced that the electro-crossover is able to park independently.  The journalists who attended the event say that the electric car can compete with such well-known brands as Bentley, Ferrari and Tesla for a number of parameters. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/b22/087/76c/b2208776c052a865c6eebc39174d6fbe.jpg">

      By the way, ex-Tesla employees who have joined the company from Tesla Motors are taking part in the development of <a href="https://www.ff.com/en/">electric cars Faraday Future</a> .  One of them, a former engineer of this company, now holds the position of vice president.  We are talking about Nick Sampson, who declared about FF 91 as follows: ‚ÄúFF 91 opens up a new era of connected vehicles‚Äù.  Now you can pre-order an electric car, but for this you need to leave a prepayment of $ 5000.  A similar prepayment scheme was used by Tesla Motors for its new electric cars, only the amount of bail was less and amounted to $ 1000. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/SAXoVSXnNTg" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br>  ‚ÄúThis is not only the fastest electric car in the world, it is also full of unique innovations,‚Äù said Gia, founder and CEO of LeEco, a service called ‚ÄúNetflix from China.‚Äù  LeEco is one of the automotive startup investors. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/5b1/f6c/5df/5b1f6c5dfcc9691dc799108bcaaf3c5e.jpg"><br><br>  An electrocrosover can travel a distance of 700 kilometers on a single battery charge.  Its length is 5.2 meters, width - 2.28 meters, height - 1.59 meters.  The vehicle was built on a modular platform entirely created by the Faraday Future.  There is here an adaptive suspension and a full control chassis.  The speed of 96 kilometers per hour is gained by the electrocross for 2.39 seconds.  This is faster than some Ferrari models. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/1Y8hUf0Np6k" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br>  The company's engineers have tried their best.  In particular, they managed to reduce the drag coefficient to 0.25.  Tesla Model S has the same figure of 0.24.  According to the developers, even the pattern of the spokes of the rims plays a role here - everything is thought out to the smallest detail. <br><br>  Power of 1050 horsepower car provides four electric motors.  They derive energy from specialized lithium-ion batteries developed by the company in conjunction with LG Chem.  Battery capacity is 130 kilowatt-hours.  The speed of a full charge of the electrocross from the most powerful home charger is about 4.5 hours.  Together with electric cars, you can order chargers for 110 or 240 V, 1.5, 10 and 15 kW.  The company declares that cars can be charged from any electric gas stations.  In other words, this elektrokrosover is universal, problems with it will not be anywhere. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/86e/abb/f23/86eabbf230e116918c7a6d16feb60a57.jpg"><br><br>  As mentioned above, there is a car parking system.  But the electric car can not only park, but also move independently along the road.  For this, it is equipped with 10 cameras, 12 ultrasonic sensors, 13 radars and an LIDAR optical rangefinder.  All this technical stuffing allows the FF 91 to identify the owner by face.  But the media system can assess the emotional state of a person.  This ‚Äúknowledge‚Äù is used, in particular, to select music or a massage mode. <br><br>  The electric car is equipped with a panoramic glass roof that can dim by pressing a button.  Rear seats can recline at an angle of up to 60 degrees. <br><br>  By the way, at the last CES exhibition, the company presented <a href="https://geektimes.ru/post/268746/">only the concept of the</a> electric supercar FFZERO1. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/-h3Xd6PXwc0" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br>  It was then only one seat, and the vehicle itself was more like a Batmobile than a real vehicle.  That concept should have attracted the attention of the public and specialists to the products of the company itself, and it really worked. <br><br>  Despite the fact that the electric car looks impressive, the company itself has financial problems.  Thus, the construction of the factory is frozen due to delayed payments.  Construction should cost Faraday Future in a substantial amount - about $ 320 million, if not more.  According to management, the company has already <a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/alanohnsman/2017/01/04/faradays-future-on-the-line-as-it-debuts-high-powered-ff-91-electric-crossover/">invested</a> more than $ 600 million in its projects. Of course, this is a huge amount by the standards of any company.  And the problem is that the company's profitability is a big question, because even Tesla Motors, which has been selling its real electric cars for several years, has shown profitability only this year.  Up to this point, the company was, if I may say so, deeply unprofitable. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/400541/">https://habr.com/ru/post/400541/</a></p>
