They are not so pathetic to break, drown, crush a cow under the hoof (and this has happened), and in the past few years the development went at such a pace that yesterday's flagships instantly passed into the category of antediluvian.  In general, the approach is fully justified.  There was only one problem: the size of the screen. <br><br>  In the range of up to 10 thousand, it was always easy to find smartphones with 4-inch screens.  Not very convenient for the Internet, but compact.  Then came the 7-inch tablets.  Comfortable for home, but I personally don‚Äôt like to carry one with me all the time.  My ideal has always been somewhere around a little more than 5 inches, but the only device for a similar price I saw was some kind of Sharp with a resolution of 800 * 640 stretched to this diagonal and occupying a significant part of the display with on-screen buttons.  Therefore, it was necessary to appear available Megafon Login + phablet, I immediately became interested in them and immediately took it.  Impressions, after a week of use, are twofold, so I consider it necessary to share them. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/f8d/e3d/873/f8de3d87316341d4a6cb858e0fcdd862.jpg"><a name="habracut"></a>

      Immediately, without delay, I will inform the most important.  <b>The phablet is locked under the operator and there are no free ways to unlock it now.</b>  Paid, as suggested in the comments, is, but I have not tested their performance.  The non-broken version is no longer quite budget, I don‚Äôt see any reason to take it for this money, so I don‚Äôt even consider this option. <br><br>  To begin with, as usual, box.  Compared with the previous operator devices, the phablet is packaged more efficiently.  Even hard to get: so tightly packed. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/05e/634/ccf/05e634ccfa9b486caaf92478d12afb18.jpg"><br><br>  Inside the actual device, pulled out the battery at 2000 mA / h, the charger for 1A, instruction and headphones. <br><br>  The design of the phablet is an obvious reference to the Megafon Login 3 tablet. I even thought, at first, that it was just a smaller version.  But, running ahead.  not.  Virtually nothing in common.  Although similar, judge for yourself: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/b21/80b/1a8/b2180b1a86b04728a171ab93aeb16dee.jpg"><br><br>  Under the shipping film, with a tongue for easy removal, another one is glued - a protective one.  Very conveniently done, because to find a special film for this device is unlikely to succeed somewhere. <br><br>  The build quality is good: the back cover is so tight that it barely took off.  But the materials are cheap, especially plastic.  The same cover, on the inside, brings back memories of Chinese toys.  However, all this is not so important for this class of devices. <br><br>  The most important thing here is iron. <br><br>  The display, contrary to expectations, turned out to be quite normal.  960 * 540 is not so small for this diagonal, as it seems.  Of course, owners of devices with FullHD-displays will be smiling, but the eyes do not get tired when reading, and this is the main thing.  Viewing angles at the level and brightness even with a margin.  In a nutshell: I liked the display more than on any budget tablet. <br><br>  The buttons are touch-sensitive, so the display space is not occupied.  But it is a little inconvenient that they are not highlighted.  If you go, like me, from a device with a different arrangement of buttons, in the dark you periodically get confused. <br><br>  RAM gigabytes, which is already standard for budget devices, so there is nothing to even say.  As shown by the week of use - enough. <br><br>  CPU.  Having learned that MTK is standing there, I was upset at first.  For some reason I didn‚Äôt trust this manufacturer before.  It turned out that nothing.  The MT6582 quad core installed in the phantom, as it turned out, renders the interface much better than the Qalcomm processor used in the same Megafon Login 3.  Much better - it means there are no brakes at all.  The interface works instantly, the sites are rendered smoothly, in general, there is enough performance.  However, in this segment you have to pay for everything.  Heats up and spends the battery, he is much stronger. <br><br>  The battery is generally the weakest point of the device.  2000 mAh there is clearly not enough.  With active use of the Internet, the phablet does not live to the end of the day - you have to recharge it.  If you turn on the display of charge percentages (disabled by default) and start actively surfing, then you can see that the level goes right before your eyes.  In general, it is great to use it at home and in the office, but I would not take it with me as a hike, considering that I usually don‚Äôt let the phone out of my hands. <br><br>  Camera.  There are two of them here.  The main one, with 5 megapixels and autofocus, is very personal.  Removes at a level slightly above average and even has a flash.  One obvious flaw - autofocus is very slow, by modern standards.  Videos can shoot in the resolution of 1280 * 720. <br>  Front camera ... Just eat.  Quality only for video calls and that's it.  There is no need to use it anymore. <br><br>  Well, about the software part.  Strongly did not interfere there: standard Android 4.4.2.  From what distinguishes the device from the mass of the rest, we can only note the ability to record telephone conversations and the setting to improve the sound quality in headphones.  The second, to my ear, most likely spoils the sound, so keep better off.  For such things on Android there is PowerAMP, where all this is much better implemented. <br><br>  Additional software is not very much.  First of all, of course, applications from Megaphone, of which MegaDisk (a cloud with free traffic on the operator‚Äôs network) and a ‚Äúmobile assistant‚Äù were useful for me personally.  In addition, Yandex.Browser (my favorite for Android), Kaspersky Internet security (for inexperienced users needed) and Clean Master (immediately deleted) are installed.  Rate the desktop and a list of pre-installed applications can be on the screenshots below: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/940/a8c/5c8/940a8c5c891d4dd7ba088ec294475e60.png"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/e02/967/704/e02967704113428b9cbb27b15b7d14ed.png"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/256/007/576/25600757664b4ff38a568c60145078bd.png"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/2a3/078/7f5/2a30787f57b9456cb19e3026df2ffadd.png"><br><br>  To complete the sensations add a couple of subjective impressions. <br><br>  This device is very well implemented support for wireless networks.  3G and Wi-Fi for some reason (according to Speedtest) work faster than on budget smartphones of the same price range tested by me.  I do not know what it is connected with. <br><br>  The sound in the headphones, if you turn off the "enhancer", is quite good.  Usually it is in some kind of metallic device, but everything is in order here.  It is unlikely that he would suit audiophiles, but for ordinary people, it will be quite to your taste.  I mean, of course, the sound in normal headphones connected to this device, and not included in the kit.  These are not even unpacked. <br><br>  <b>Summarizing the above, or for those who are too lazy to read it all.</b>  For a little more than 5,000 rubles (this, given the mandatory connection of the Internet option for 3 months), the device is quite worthy.  A convenient for me size, which is also comfortable for viewing sites, and it is not a shame to read a book on its back, and even calling from such a device.  No glitches and brakes were found during operation; the phablet does not force itself to console every five minutes with the fact that ‚Äúwell, this is a budget device.‚Äù  No complaints, but nothing annoying. <br><br>  However.  I will undoubtedly not praise.  You need to be prepared for the fact that the battery life hints at the desired presence of charging at least in the evening, or at the presence of a "dialer" as the main device for calls.  Those who are often on the road more than a working day, the device will not be very convenient.  And the display.  Although for me it is comfortable, but you still need to make sure that it is compatible with your own eyes.  Because I‚Äôve seen a lot of reviews on the network about what permission is ‚Äî it‚Äôs still not enough. <br><br>  The rest - in my opinion, it turned out well.  Unless, of course, you use or intend to use the services of the operator who issued it. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/374695/">https://habr.com/ru/post/374695/</a></p>
