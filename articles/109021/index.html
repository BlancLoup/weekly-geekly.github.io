  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Innovations at school or how to finish Russian education</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Only lazy now does not criticize schooling.  It is said a lot that it does not satisfy modern requirements, that it is morally and physically obsolete, that the school is a prison, etc. Many ideas are proposed on how to make the modern educational system better.  And it really needs to be improved.  From my work experience, I can say that about 40% of modern eighth grade students make systematic errors in the multiplication table.  Only a few can divide the bar or be able to count the degree.  In pursuit of the quantity and quality of education, the most important skills of reading, studying, research, and independent work are completely absent from the modern student.  Moreover, practically no pupil of a regular secondary school is able, after reading a textbook several times, to write down a synopsis, select the main parts and draw conclusions from the material.  As probably many people know, self-education in the modern information society is the most important quality of a successful person.  About motivation, I do not even stutter. <br><br>  But that's all - the lyrics.  Our favorite state, trying to increase the competitiveness and innovativeness of education, is introducing more and more bureaucratic obstacles that negate all the efforts made by individual teachers to improve the quality of education.  And I would like to tell about one of them, which is introduced (at least in St. Petersburg) from January 1, 2010. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  First of all, what are the main responsibilities of an ordinary teacher: <br><ul><li>  Drawing up thematic planning </li><li>  Preparation of lesson planning </li><li>  Inspection Schedule </li><li>  Trimester (quarter) reports </li><li>  Annual reports </li><li>  Refresher courses </li><li>  Revalidation </li><li>  Open class reports </li><li>  Performance reports </li><li>  Filling the magazine </li><li>  etc. </li></ul><br>  If we estimate in percent, then about 20-30% of the working time is spent on filling out formal circulars.  Provided that the salary (at least in Petersburg) of a teacher at one rate (36 hours per week, 18 of them are lessons) is about 8,000‚Äì9,000 rubles.  And this is without a pile of waste paper to prepare for the exam.  And without preparation, in fact, for the lessons (presentations, tests, reports, media materials, videos, photos, etc.).  But our beloved state is not enough. <br><br>  Since 2011, a new system of electronic diaries has been introduced in all schools.  It would seem a great idea.  And the excuse for its introduction is excellent - they say, parents will be able to quickly monitor the progress of their children.  But, as always, a good idea in our Russian reality turns into a bureaucracy.

      First, there is exactly one computer for keeping a diary.  One computer on which the corresponding software is installed (terribly crooked, by the way).  Thus, there will be a queue of people willing to write down to make daily assessments.  At the same time, <b>each student</b> individually needs to indicate the subject of the lesson, the grade (plus what the grade is for), and also the homework.  True, the developers promise to partially automate this, but nonetheless.  Although the laws are clear enough - the assessment should be set during the lesson, and not after.  But who cares about such trifles. <br><br>  Secondly, nobody cancels the usual paper magazine.  That is, in addition to the usual waste paper, teachers will need to fill and electronic.  Of course, nobody is going to teach them to fill in, to organize all this. <br><br>  Thirdly, each document, whether it be thematic or lesson planning, needs to be added to the electronic database.  And, of course, pass in the form of paper. <br><br>  Fourth, on the strength of 5-10% of parents, according to the experience of other regions (according to some data from St. Petersburg - 15-20%) will monitor the assessments of their children.  In this case, it is precisely those parents who systematically check diaries, go to parent meetings, in general, are interested in the success of their children.  It is unlikely that parents who do not care about the child will use the electronic diaries system. <br><br>  Fifth, the system is not certified.  It is completely incomprehensible how personal data of students are protected and protected at all.  With a very high probability in a month or two, all assessments can be purchased at Juno (Gorbushka).  Where this may lead - see the wonderful experience of the United States. <br><br>  Sixth, no one is against the electronic journals themselves.  But why duplication?  Why prepare the same forms in two versions? <br><br>  The answer to the question of who will suffer from all this is also obvious - children.  Instead of preparing for the lesson, creating presentations and manuals, the teacher will be engaged in ‚Äúmodernization‚Äù during working hours.  Similarly, from 40-45 minutes of a lesson 10-15 will go to fill in magazines and other forms.  Coupled with the current level of education in 5-10 years, this will lead to an even worse level of education. <br><br>  And most importantly, such a bureaucracy will put an end to those specialists who went to school for the sake of children.  Despite low wages, despite all administrative and bureaucratic obstacles.  After the introduction of such electronic systems, these people are unlikely to want to go to school, since they will spend 3-4 hours filling in useless forms for 1 hour of lessons.  For the money that a good specialist can get for a few days of work instead of such a month.  Sometimes it even seems that modern education officials are trying with might and main to prevent specialists from entering the school. <br><br>  Responsible for this "modernization" are district and city education committees, where officials (by the way, quite specific, you can even list by name) in the standard way "fill" the rating.  Just like the widely publicized campaign with the installation of open source software (so far I personally have not received the WORKING DISK with Alt Linux).  Orders come from above, school administration bends as well as always.  Even despite the clear violation of the Labor Code, the law on education and a number of other regulatory documents.  Indeed, who cares about such a trifle as laws, when it comes to someone else's breadboard place. <br><br>  And the worst thing is that teachers have become accustomed to the fact that always ‚Äúmodernization‚Äù leaves them sideways.  No, dissatisfied with these innovations - a lot.  Especially in words.  But when it comes to real things (for example, the prohibition of such on the teachers' council), most of the "dissenters" disappear somewhere.  And, alas, this is not the best example for children who, as I would like to believe, in the future they will create a normal civil society, which will ‚Äúsweep a nasty broom‚Äù of such ‚Äúmodernizers‚Äù. <br><br>  Thank! </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/109021/">https://habr.com/ru/post/109021/</a></p>
