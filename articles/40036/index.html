  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Useful tickets</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"><img align="left" src="http://img2.imageshost.ru/imgs/78bb82db1a9742a024fd38b868fc851d/cbdd3066a1ed8a4fda88b63098b883b6.jpg">  My work has specifics for a long time to get to it, and with transplantation and public transport.  Such transport of large cities is familiar to many: at peak times it is canned food filled with people on wheels.  Traffic jams and a long ride already worsen, and so bad mood.  If you still do not sleep in the morning, then a complete end to the whole working day. <br><br>  And everyone certainly knows the public transport attribute - ticket.  In everyday life, we do not pay attention to him.  Sometimes only people look for happy tickets, and especially superstitious people eat it later (as they say: ‚Äúno one imagines that a dollar crash in the west is caused by the fact that someone in the outback of Russia ate a happy ticket‚Äù). <br><br>  Under the cut, I would like to tell you how to draw a little more benefit from a trip in public transport, evaluate the ticket on the merit and just have a little fun. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><img align="right" src="http://img2.imageshost.ru/imgs/4a15f2719e6907f90b3615d811947199/tf013d408d12ee7ca74503c4ac3da7d81.jpg">  So, all I want to offer is training or gymnastics for the mind.  A characteristic feature of any ticket is its number.  Usually it is six-digit, sometimes more, sometimes less.  Gymnastics consists of the following rules: <br><ul><li>  having a set of numbers, it is necessary to make such an arithmetic sequence so that in the end the figure is 100; </li><li>  it is allowed to use only the signs: "+", "-", "*", "/"; </li><li>  brackets are allowed; </li><li>  it is allowed to collect numbers into groups at the stage of placement of characters, for example: having the number 6 5 5 8 0 3, we can group and get the numbers for the operations ‚Äú65‚Äù or ‚Äú655‚Äù or ‚Äú80‚Äù or ‚Äú58‚Äù.  That is, such a ticket 101001 can be solved like this: 101 + 0 + 0 - 1 = 100; </li><li>  it is forbidden that the result of one of the actions was negative, such as we have 890101, it is impossible to write 8-9 + 0 + 101; </li><li>  the order of numbers must be strictly observed. </li></ul><br>  Everything is elementary simple.  But it is at first glance.  I assure you that after the tenth such ticket you will understand that there are tough nuts too.  In fact, there are numbers that cannot be solved, there are those that have many solutions, few that have one or only two solutions. <br><img align="right" src="http://img2.imageshost.ru/imgs/f33466d7a81d8472d0caac3926939510/a07ddcfdff410d2738fe2bc21f7c43b6.jpg">  The benefits of such gymnastics are as follows (I describe my case): <br><ul><li>  shake the brain well before work; </li><li>  You can well turn off the brain from working with the "ticket" button and only then focus on something else.  I think many people know the feeling that work is going home with you and will not lag behind.  Ticket will help you to turn off the work of consciousness and turn on something else, more useful; </li><li>  good exercise for the mind, sometimes you can guess a few tens of minutes and do not solve it; </li><li>  positive emotions that occur every time when an unobvious decision is found and as if you see clearly; </li><li>  when you go together, you can decide at home and by exchanging with each other try to find a neighbor's solution, sometimes one finds the other not, then the other can flash with the mind - a kind of joint game that requires nothing special. </li></ul><img align="left" src="http://img2.imageshost.ru/imgs/0bcae71e1f34abe713c98f6b008d95b8/66294559bdcedbbca903656badd411d6.jpg"><br>  Not always in the transport there is an opportunity to read a book, to flip through the Internet on a handheld or smartphone, sometimes the stuck ads are annoying.  Then pay attention to what you are holding: a ticket.  And try my advice.  And for starters, try to solve those tickets that are listed on this page.
