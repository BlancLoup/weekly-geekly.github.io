  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Make a start-up possible in your life?</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Note: a little emotional, so let us forgive me in advance. <br><br>  So, I suggest everyone reading this to ask themselves the question: is a startup possible in his life?  The problem is that we are going and talking about the Internet business, about hi tec, about google, about anything, we all dream to repeat their success and are looking for a way to it.  But can we stand still?  Yes.  For most it is. <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  We are looking for business ideas, day by day, some are trying to make money on <br>  the same google, ebay, adsense and others, but guys, don't you see that making big money is more difficult?  In fact, the amount of effort for earning $ 1000 and $ 1,000,000 is the same.  Just in the first case, you will do what you have done before (for example, write CODE), and in the second case, what no one else has done.  This insignificant difference in approach and increases the remuneration by orders of magnitude. <br>  (Based on a lot of start-up success stories, some of which were published on my blog)

      I traded with her for a penny - and got a penny. <br>  And ask I a million - take and bemused? <br>  She even lived this life, but gives her own. <br>  We are alone with her, but we are in her service. <br>  (c) an author unknown to me. <br><br>  But wait a minute, you tell me that this money is necessary to <br>  live!  And you will be right.  This money is earned to pay <br>  life, before thinking about a startup, you need to think about financial <br>  security, that is, when you can invest in Startup. <br><br>  Let me explain: in the morning you wake up and understand that you don‚Äôt need to go to work, <br>  when you have a monthly passive income, you can spend the whole day <br>  to work on a startup hoping (and it is very prudent) that, sooner or later, luck will knock on you and write a check for a million. <br><br>  One problem: to earn money on financial independence (bonds, stocks with good dividends, at worst a large deposit in a bank) will take 2/3 of life. <br><br>  <b>Now let's see how things are in the West.</b> <br>  There, guys like us, come to a private investor and say, we want <br>  make a website that sells movie tickets on the internet (let's say <br>  etix.com).  They allocate the amount of half a million dollars, and begins <br>  Project.  Now these guys don't have to think about life.  Enough money with <br>  by more than one.  Sooner or later, the project will either close or sell for <br>  mad money, in any case, the guys will be able to take a new piece of paper <br>  A4, spell out a new Big Idea and go for the money.  And the chances of their success are likely to increase.  because now they are a well-established team, with experience in developing complex web solutions. <br><br>  I wonder why this is impossible in Russia?  Because on the elite <br>  real estate in Moscow can make up to 100% profit per year.  And investor <br>  most likely will invest in real estate, but not in a startup. <br><br>  <b>Ask yourself a question Is it possible to start-up in your life ??</b> <br><br>  How many executive executives do you have in store?  And how many ready <br>  business plans?  And how many products in finished and working form? <br>  How many times a day do you personally contact investors with offers? <br>  Have you already found a fund that wants to invest in you?  How many kilometers away from you to the nearest investor?  What?  Is he in another city?  Then, how many kilometers have you traveled to get to him at the reception?  How many attempts are you willing to take to get the money?  What?  I can not hear??  Ten?  Ten!???  You do not believe in your product?  What?  Do you believe ?!  Then why ten ??  What-oh ??  twenty?!!?  When you believe in your product this number is much higher!  It is a thousand, it is ten thousand attempts!  Tell me, are you eternal ?!  What?  don't understand the question?  I repeat: will you live forever ????  Not??!!!  Then why the hell are you still here? !!!  Go and do business immediately! <br><br>  Do not waste a minute of this lousy life to become better, to do something great!  Yes!  like this guy!  Cheer up !!!  Everything will turn out !!! <br>  Dedicated to the post: defann :) </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/3842/">https://habr.com/ru/post/3842/</a></p>
