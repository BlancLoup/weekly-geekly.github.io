      And now - the details! <br><br><h3>  <a href="https://www.redhat.com/en/blog/serverless-next-phase-cloud-native-application-development%3Fsource%3Dbloglisting">Serverless computing is the next step in cloud application development?</a> <br>  Rich Sharples, Senior Manager, Red Hat </h3><br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/-v/lx/jf/-vlxjfserr0bl6-n7uqh_7wmexm.png"></div><br>  The concept of serverless computing reflects a shift in ideas about how developers should create and deliver software systems.  By abstracting the application infrastructure from software code, this new approach helps to significantly simplify the development process, reducing costs and increasing efficiency. <br><br>  We believe that serverless computing and ‚Äúfunction as a service‚Äù solutions will play an important role in shaping the next generation of corporate IT infrastructures, as well as cloud services and hybrid environments. <br><br>  In fact, the concept of serverless computing has been around for almost two years and during this time has managed to acquire various approaches and development communities. <br><br>  Observing the growing interest in these projects and assessing their status and prospects, last year we announced that we would focus on supporting the Apache OpenWhisk project. <br><br>  This project was launched by IBM and today operates under the auspices of the Apache Software Foundation with the support of several other organizations.  In our opinion, OpenWhisk has a great technological potential and a dynamic growing ecosystem. <br><br>  More on this: <a href="https://developers.redhat.com/products/cloudfunctions/overview/">Red Hat OpenShift Cloud Functions - serverless computing on the Red Hat OpenShift platform</a> <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/c-/ns/ug/c-nsugt2mnesxfvhhzdsl77l3sm.png"></div><br><h3>  <a href="https://www.redhat.com/en/blog/localhost-cloud-helping-organizations-develop-applications-hybrid-world%3Fsource%3Dbloglisting">From localhost to the cloud: help develop applications for the hybrid world</a> <br>  Harry Mower, Director of Development and Marketing, Red Hat </h3><br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/8u/ce/mw/8ucemwn68ur4n9uklktu8etj1h0.png"></div><br>  Desktop development tools are still the main and most comfortable working tool for most developers.  At the same time, we are witnessing a growing interest in new application technologies and related tools.  In particular, programmers today use the cloud for hosting and managing development environments, and also move development tools to the cloud. <br><br>  Last year, we expanded our development toolkit for developers, in particular, by acquiring Codenvy, a company that produces unique container solutions, as well as by launching the online development environment <a href="https://openshift.io/">OpenShift.io</a> . <br><br>  Today we announce the following two steps in this direction: <br><br><ul><li>  OpenShift.io open access - today </li><li>  Commercial product Red Hat based on Eclipse Che - during 2018 </li></ul><br>  SaaS solution <a href="https://openshift.io/">OpenShift.io</a> offers a fully ready-to-use set of development tools.  With its help, developers can immediately start creating containerized applications, without wasting time installing and configuring software components of the environment.  The solution allows you to roll out developed applications and implement requests to incorporate the changes literally within a few minutes - all without the need to deploy your own IT infrastructure. <br><br><h3>  <a href="https://www.redhat.com/en/about/press-releases/red-hat-and-microsoft-co-develop-first-red-hat-openshift-jointly-managed-service-public-cloud">Red Hat and Microsoft will develop the first joint solution Red Hat OpenShift solution on the Azure platform</a> </h3><br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/db/rf/0t/dbrf0tckhhduqtlfnw1bpuyzj28.png"></div><br>  Red Hat and Microsoft have announced an expansion of the partnership to provide enterprise application developers with the ability to run container applications in the Microsoft Azure cloud and on-premise computing capacity using the first open-sharing joint RedShift solution based on Red Hat OpenShift in the public Microsoft Azure cloud. <br><br>  The transition of organizations to the technology of container applications and Kubernetes for the purpose of digital transformation and compliance with market requirements forms a request for solutions for simple universal orchestration and maintenance of applications in a public cloud and corporate data center.  Red Hat and Microsoft will jointly design and implement such a solution called Red Hat OpenShift on Azure, which will be provided with technical support and managed for the benefit of customers by the joint efforts of both companies and will be their priority offer for those who simultaneously use Red Hat and Microsoft products and services. . <br><br>  In addition to the fact that Red Hat OpenShift on Azure completely relieves enterprise application developers from the tasks of platform maintenance, the solution will also provide them with the following benefits: <br><br><ul><li>  Flexibility - the freedom to move applications between the data center and the Azure cloud using a single universal platform OpenShift for hybrid cloud environments </li><li>  Speed ‚Äã‚Äã- fast and secure hybrid network that integrates the Azure platform and on-premises OpenShift clusters </li><li>  Productivity ‚Äî access Azure services such as Azure Cosmos DB, Azure Machine Learning and Azure SQL DB for efficient application development </li></ul><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/3s/2m/6t/3s2m6t8omptckrm41tooed2nqlu.jpeg"></div><br><h3>  <a href="https://www.redhat.com/en/about/press-releases/ibm-and-red-hat-join-forces-accelerate-hybrid-cloud-adoption">IBM and Red Hat join forces to promote hybrid cloud environments</a> </h3><br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/jr/nl/im/jrnlimmpqkvpx2j2swhchv8z_em.png"></div><br>  Red Hat and IBM have announced a significant expansion of the collaboration program, which will help customers to fully realize the benefits of the solutions of both companies in private and public clouds. <br><br>  IBM agreed to provide its middleware solutions (WebSphere, MQ and DB2) in the form of certified containers for the Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform.  The parties also agreed to integrate their Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform and IBM Cloud Private container platforms, as well as the ability to deploy the OpenShift Container Platform in the IBM public cloud. <br><br>  IBM recently began the process of containerizing the entire stack of its software solutions, including WebSphere, MQ Series, and DB2, as containers quickly become the industry standard for reliably and securely transferring applications between corporate data centers and public cloud platforms.  This IBM initiative combines perfectly with Red Hat's extensive suite of enterprise solutions for cloud and hybrid infrastructures and, when combined with them, allows us to offer customers a clear and precise plan for migrating to hybrid cloud environments. <br><br>  IBM and Red Hat Extended Partnership will help customers: <br><br><ul><li>  Get the most out of existing IT technologies and easily transfer them to a hybrid cloud based on IBM Cloud Private and Red Hat OpenShift solutions </li><li>  Accelerate the creation, upgrading and deployment of new applications, as well as take advantage of the IBM cloud services in the field of artificial intelligence, the Internet of things and the blockchain using the IBM Cloud Private based on the Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform </li></ul><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/on/xn/cm/onxncmqdgicxwe5qswpnlvwbiaa.png"></div><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/gi/zj/go/gizjgoq0dww2e1l3syt-_axc6xe.png"></div><br><h3>  <a href="https://www.redhat.com/en/about/press-releases/red-hat-unveils-roadmap-coreos-integration-red-hat-openshift">Red Hat Introduces CoreOS and Red Hat OpenShift Integration Plan</a> </h3><br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/_r/k1/1n/_rk11nkufhv_4agnfbd_nriojpk.png"></div><br>  Integration of CoreOS technologies into Red Hat OpenShift will allow you to fully automate the entire stack of container Linux platform in a hybrid cloud, from the operating system to application services. <br><br>  <b>Automated OpenShift operations</b> <br><br>  Tectonic, CoreOS's corporate Kubernetes solution, offers advanced management capabilities for large Kubernetes infrastructures using the so-called automated over-the-air update, which greatly simplifies roll-out upgrade deployments of Tectonic clusters and underlying Container Linux hosts.  Red Hat plans to include this technology in the Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform, its corporate-class Kubernetes platform, as automated operations. <br><br>  Automated updates allow you to realize the benefits of Tectonic, complete with user-familiar Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform reliability, support and advanced application development.  This will greatly simplify the deployment of large-scale configurations of Kubernetes by automating the lion‚Äôs share of routine tasks, reducing the need for constant administration by IT professionals and opening the way to operating clusters of fully automated industries.  At the same time, such important factors for corporate customers as platform stability and support for existing IT systems will be fully preserved. <br><br>  <b>Initiative Operator Framework</b> <br><br>  CoreOS is the founder of a new software class for Kubernetes, called Operators, which is special application controllers that extend the Kubernetes APIs to create, configure and manage instances of complex stateful applications on behalf of the Kubernetes user.  In other words, operators allow to build in ‚Äúhuman knowledge‚Äù of how the operation of Kubernetes applications is structured into the applications themselves, which greatly simplifies deployment and maintenance. <br><br>  The concept of Operators was first introduced at the KubeCon Europe 2018 conference, and today it is being implemented as part of the open project Operator Framework, which will become the basis for the implementation of Operator functionality within the Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform, including for the benefit of independent software vendors that form the ecosystem of partner solutions Red Hat.  The goal of this initiative is to make it easier for independent providers to provide their cloud services in hybrid environments, including messaging services, big data processing and other analytical services, and to expand the range of supported corporate deployment models without reference to specific cloud platforms.  In addition, the Red Hat Affiliate Program for independent software vendors will also be expanded to include automation solutions developers based on the Operator Framework.  The result of these efforts will be a unified universal model for the deployment and operation of third-party services on the Red Hat OpenShift platform, accelerating their delivery to the market and ensuring that these services can be used in any cloud environments where Red Hat OpenShift can work. <br><br>  <b>Container Linux as the foundation of Red Hat OpenShift</b> <br><br>  Container Linux is an extremely lightweight in terms of size and functionality of the Linux distribution for container environments, ensuring efficient operation in large clusters by auto-updating ‚Äúover the air‚Äù.  Container Linux will continue to evolve through an open development community and will remain a free, rapidly evolving OS for container hosts with a high degree of automation, while also being able to use components of the Red Hat Enterprise Linux ecosystem and Fedora.  In addition, corporate customers will be offered a commercial support option called Red Hat CoreOS, which will eventually replace Atomic Host as a container-oriented Red Hat operating system. <br><br>  Red Hat CoreOS will be the foundation of the Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform, Red Hat OpenShift Online and Red Hat OpenShift Dedicated solutions for customers who need an automatic update Kubernetes platform.  In addition, the Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform will continue to support Red Hat Enterprise Linux in the interests of those who prefer to build their Kubernetes environment based on the traditional life-cycle operating system and manage its packages. <br><br>  <b>Red Hat Quay and OpenShift</b> <br><br>  In recent years, CoreOS Quay has been actively used by Red Hat customers as a corporate registry of container images.  Compared to the OpenShift registry registry, the CoreOS solution offers a number of add-ons that are important for corporate users and will now become part of the Red Hat Quay Enterprise and Quay.io solutions.  In particular, this includes automated geo-replication, integrated verification of container safety with Clair tools, tracking of the history of images using the ‚Äútime machine‚Äù functionality, as well as means of rollback and automated cleaning.  Quay is now part of the Red Hat portfolio of solutions and is offered both as enterprise-class software and as a cloud-based service called Quay.io.  In future releases, it is planned to expand the functionality and integration of Quay with OpenShift. <br><br><h3>  <a href="https://www.redhat.com/en/about/press-releases/red-hat-brings-cloud-native-capabilities-software-partner-ecosystem-kubernetes-operators">Kubernetes Operators make it easy to develop partner solutions for Red Hat OpenShift</a> </h3><br>  Kubernetes Operators technology greatly simplifies ISV developers with the task of delivering proven and tested cloud applications and services for Red Hat OpenShift in hybrid and multi-cloud environments. <br><br>  ‚ÄúRed Hat plans to use its extensive technical expertise on Kubernetes and the development of cloud applications and services to help our ISV partners and customers create their own components of Kubernetes Operators, which will then be easy to deploy and maintain in bulk on the Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform platform "- Ashesh Badani (Ashesh Badani), vice president of Red Hat for products and services OpenShift <br><br>  Red Hat is also working to expand the functionality of Kubernetes Operators, which will allow ISV developers to test and test their Operators for Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform components for Red Hat OpenShift operation.  In other words, developers of solutions that form the Red Hat OpenShift ecosystem will be able to get firm guarantees that their products and services will function properly on any version of Red Hat OpenShift, including those deployed in hybrid and multi-cloud environments based on Microsoft Azure, Google Cloud , Amazon Web Services, etc. This will increase customer confidence in the Red Hat OpenShift partner solutions they use and help developers of such solutions improve their manageability and support in all environments where customers may need them. <br><br>  Currently, support for the Kubernetes Operator initiative for the Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform was announced by Black Duck Software, Couchbase, CrunchyData and Dynatrace, which presented their achievements as part of the Red Hat Summit 2018. The following Red Hat partners also announced their intention to use Kubernetes Operator (list incomplete): <br><br>  6Fusion;  Aporeto;  Aqua Security;  Avi Networks;  Avocado Systems;  Banzai Cloud;  BOLT;  CA Technologies;  Catalogic;  Cockroach Labs;  CollabNet;  CoScale;  CyberArk;  Datadog;  DeployHub;  DSApps;  Entando;  EXFO;  F5;  FinTECHeando;  Guardicore;  Hazelcast;  Hedvig;  HTBase;  Infinidat;  Influxdata;  Instana;  InterSystems;  Kaazing;  Layered Insight;  LINBIT;  Lucep;  Mist.io;  Nagios;  nearForm;  NetApp;  NetScout;  NeuVector;  New Relic;  NuoDB;  OpenIAM;  Outcold Solutions;  Portworx;  PrimeKey;  ProfitStor;  Pure Storage;  Redis Labs;  Rocket.Chat;  ScaleOut Software;  SL Corporation;  Snapt;  SolutionSoft;  Sonatype;  Sysdig;  Tremolo Security;  Turbonomic;  Twistlock;  Univa;  Virtuozzo;  Waldur;  XebiaLabs;  YumaWorks and Zabbix. <br><br><h3>  <a href="https://middlewareblog.redhat.com/2018/05/09/announcing-amq-streams-apache-kafka-on-openshift/">Red Hat Introduces AMQ Streams: Apache Kafka on the OpenShift Platform</a> </h3><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/tm/8y/ng/tm8yng0sh0apmyfcbpbkhiioqoa.png" align="right">  We are pleased to present the Developer Preview version of Red Hat AMQ Streams, a new addition to the <a href="https://www.redhat.com/en/technologies/jboss-middleware/amq">Red Hat AMQ</a> solutions, which enables Apache Kafka to run on the OpenShift platform. <br><br>  Apache Kafka is a leading real-time, distributed, distributed messaging platform for building data processing pipelines and streaming applications. <br><br>  Using Kafka technology, applications can: <br><br><ul><li>  Publish and subscribe to data streams </li><li>  Store data streams </li><li>  Process data as it becomes available. </li></ul><br>  Kafka technology not only allows you to do all this quickly, but also provides scaling out and fault tolerance, making it great for a variety of scenarios, including tracking website activity, aggregating metrics and logs, processing flows and event sources, and IoT telemetry.  The Red Hat solution developed by AMQ Streams will enable customers to run Apache Kafka on the Red Hat Enterprise Linux and Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform platforms. <br><br>  AMQ Streams greatly simplifies tasks such as: <br><br><ul><li>  Deploy a Kafka cluster of the required size with one click or one oc create command </li><li>  Deploying the Kafka topic component directly next to the microservice that uses it </li><li>  Scaling sections Kafka topic </li><li>  Scaling the Kafka cluster up and down depending on the load </li></ul><br><h3>  <a href="https://www.redhat.com/en/about/press-releases/using-openshift-openstack-red-hat-customers-power-infrastructure-and-application-modernization">Red Hat solutions based on OpenShift and OpenStack help customers upgrade corporate infrastructures and applications</a> </h3><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/dp/0z/np/dp0znpzzyaw2zxh6ltzimqlyu_u.png"></div><br>  OpenStack and Kubernetes hybrid cloud solutions help accelerate business transformation by moving to the development of container applications and tight integration of cloud technologies. <br><br>  Red Hat is witnessing a growing worldwide interest in Kubernetes and OpenStack-based hybrid solutions and is recording more and more cases of successful use, here are just a few examples: <br><br><ul><li>  Banco Multiva - Banking and Investment Services, Mexico </li><li>  Genesys - Customer Service Provider, USA </li><li>  UKCloud - provider of public cloud services, UK </li></ul><br><h3>  <a href="https://www.redhat.com/en/about/press-releases/lufthansa-technik-builds-its-digital-future-red-hat">Lufthansa Technik builds a digital future with Red Hat</a> </h3><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/_k/rd/is/_krdisv4f3wf_caiwqp638egbjo.png"></div><br>  Lufthansa Technik, a leading aircraft maintenance and repair company, has switched to a hybrid cloud-based infrastructure based on open-source Red Hat solutions operating in the Microsoft Azure public cloud. <br><br>  In close collaboration with Red Hat, the company has developed an open platform, AVIATAR, which helps to improve interaction with customers from the aviation industry and launch digital products and services that enhance the quality of customer service. <br><br>  Through the use of containers and automation technology from Red Hat, combined with the introduction of DevOps methodology, Lufthansa Technik was able to more quickly develop and deploy new applications and improve the integration of its internal infrastructure with third-party solutions. <br><br>  When using the AVIATAR platform, the following Red Hat solutions were used: <br><br>  ‚óè Red Hat Enterprise Linux - a flexible and reliable enterprise-class Linux distribution that acts as the foundation of AVIATAR <br>  ‚óè Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform on Azure, optimized to support ongoing improvements to the AVIATAR platform within the <a href="https://www.redhat.com/en/insights/devops">DevOps</a> methodology.  The Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform is also used to develop, deploy, launch, and integrate Lufthansa Technik infrastructure components. <br><br><ul><li>  Red Hat Gluster Storage based container storage is a flexible and scalable <a href="https://www.redhat.com/en/topics/data-storage/software-defined-storage">software-defined storage cluster</a> optimized for the Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform and requiring minimal manual intervention </li><li>  The Red Hat JBoss Enterprise Application Platform (JBoss EAP) is the backend core of enterprise applications delivered to end users through the AVIATAR platform.

Red Hat's corporate-class Kubernetes platform helps Vorwerk build, deploy, and support applications in hybrid and multi-cloud infrastructures. <br><br>  As a result, Vorwerk was able to increase the efficiency of delivery of both modern and traditional applications, speed up the development cycle and reduce operating costs.  In addition to the Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform, Vorwerk also uses the following Red Hat solutions: <br><br><ul><li>  Red Hat CloudForms to manage its new hybrid cloud architecture.  Red Hat CloudForms is a <a href="https://www.redhat.com/en/technologies/management/cloudforms">hybrid infrastructure management platform</a> that implements self-service and resource provisioning, tracks costs and helps unify the management of containers, physical and virtual machines, public and <a href="https://www.redhat.com/en/technologies/cloud-computing/private-cloud">private clouds.</a> </li><li>  Red Hat Gluster Storage based containerized storage is a flexible and scalable <a href="https://www.redhat.com/en/topics/data-storage/software-defined-storage">software-defined storage cluster</a> optimized for the Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform and requiring minimal manual intervention </li><li>  Red Hat Ansible Automation is a powerful and convenient <a href="https://www.redhat.com/en/technologies/management/ansible">open source automation toolkit</a> .  Thanks to him, Vorwerk was able to automate the deployment and scaling of applications in its hybrid cloud infrastructure to effectively support the multimillion army of IoT devices. </li></ul><br><h3>  <a href="https://www.redhat.com/en/blog/red-hats-new-mission-making-its-four-footprints-immaterial">New Red Hat Mission: Erase Differences Between IT Environments</a> <br>  Paul Cormier, President, Red Hat Product and Technology </h3><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/h8/xy/t3/h8xyt3ids3ddnlazihtcyg4cqts.png"></div><br>  In recent years, Red Hat has placed particular emphasis on the interchangeability of the four IT environments ‚Äî physical servers, virtual machines, private and public cloud environments ‚Äî since none of them alone can fully meet the needs of a modern enterprise in a rapidly changing market environment and customer needs. . <br><br>  Hybrid cloud, in which resources and loads are distributed between these four environments, is today one of the foundations of digital transformation.  And the other is integrity: the IT manager needs assurance that corporate applications and services will behave the same always and everywhere.  This is far from news, you have already heard all this from me and from Red Hat, and even on previous Red Hat Summit. <br><br>  And now I will say something really new: for the end user, these four environments have no meaning.  Hybrid cloud is becoming the corporate standard, because in search of answers to the challenges, organizations choose solutions regardless of the environment in which they work and who offers them. <br><br>  In my opinion, now for corporate IT systems there comes a turning point when the basic components of the technological stack are moving into the category of "utilities", as the foundation, electrical wiring and sewage near the house.  Continuing the analogy, the choice of materials in the construction of the house and the quality of the work done are certainly important, but in everyday life almost all of this is hidden from the eyes of the homeowner. <br><br>  Red Hat sees its mission to provide the customer with a standardized platform that provides stability, integrity and reliability in all four IT environments, regardless of what hardware, services, and external services are at their core. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/358806/">https://habr.com/ru/post/358806/</a></p>
