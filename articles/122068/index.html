  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Brand cards: get your bonus!</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Hello, habrazhiteli! <br>  Surely almost every one of you has a bank card.  And since an advanced person should be promoted in everything, it‚Äôs time to stop using it to receive and cash out salaries and find out what additional features this piece of plastic, called a ‚Äúbank card‚Äù, can provide. <br>  It will focus on the currently popular co-branded projects.  And since our shirt is closer to the body, we will tell about them on the example of our co-branded cards. <br>  We have joint maps with leading Russian airlines - Aeroflot and Transaero.  Using these cards for their intended purpose (that is, paying for goods and services), you can get a free air ticket and other bonuses (upgrading the service class for the flight, for example). <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  How it works.  For example, take the Transaero card of the classic category (MasterCard Standard).  Paying her for goods and services, you will receive bonus points. <br>  Want to see the Brandenburg Gate in Berlin, ancient castles in Pardubice, or visit the many museums in Vienna?  You are welcome!  For this you need to accumulate 2700 points.  The points accumulation algorithm is very simple.  For the first use of the Transaero card to pay for anything, you will receive 100 points regardless of the amount spent.  Further, for every 100 rubles spent, you will receive one point on your bonus account.  If we assume that, on average, you will spend 30,000 rubles a month on the card, it turns out that you can fly to Europe for free in 9 months: 100 points + 1 point √ó 300 = 400 points in the first month and 300 points each every next month.  Such is simple arithmetic.  Of course, if you spend more than 30,000 per month or have a gold or platinum category card, the accumulation process will go faster (6 and 4 months, respectively). <br>  Not enough 500 points, but in Europe really want?  No problems!  Missing points can be obtained on credit. <br>  To find out the number of accumulated points, you need to enter your login (Transaero Privilege member number on the Transaero card) and the password, which you can get there on the site, by filling out the member's form, or by calling the hotline. airlines. <br>  Against the background of all these charms, there is only one ‚Äúcatch‚Äù: to get a free ticket, you must first buy at least one for your money (for any Transaero flight). <br>  You can use the right to a free flight and get a bonus ticket by calling the airline or visiting one of its offices and happily informing the operator that you have accumulated a sufficient amount of points. <br>  The Transaero card, in addition to the possibility of obtaining a free ticket, also provides other benefits: check-in at business class counters, increased priority on the waiting list (if you don‚Äôt find the flight or ticket you need, use this service and the Transaero Privilege employee will contact you, as soon as a suitable ticket appears and notifies you about the time of its redemption), the possibility of free transportation of additional kilograms of baggage and others (depending on the category of card). <br>  The Aeroflot Bonus card ‚Äúworks‚Äù according to a similar principle, only bonus miles are added instead of points. <br>  Another popular cobrand is the Metro card.  You after all not only fly on airplanes, but also ride the subway?  Then you will be interested to know that the card can be used not only for receiving, storing and spending money, but also to be a travel ticket for the metro. <br>  The principle of operation is simple: apply the card to the turnstile and go ahead!  You can still wave a pen or poke a finger (although no, this should not be done) at poor people who lose time and nerves in endless lines at the ticket office.  You will never have to do this again.  Forget like a bad dream. <br>  And with ‚ÄúMetro‚Äù not only time is saved, but also money - the cost of one trip is cheaper than buying tickets at the box office.  See for yourself.  Suppose a month you make trips and spend 1380 rubles (1245 rubles for a ticket for 60 trips + 135 rubles for a ticket for 5 trips).  And with the Metro card for 65 trips you will spend 1235.5 rubles, saving, thus, 144.5 rubles or 1734 rubles per year for which you can buy some useful gadget.  Also, remember, do you always run out of travel limits? <br>  The amount you ‚Äúhit‚Äù for a month will be automatically deducted from your account at the beginning of the next one. <br>  So, when you come to the <a href="http://smpbank.ru/ru/private/paycards">bank</a> to issue a card, ask about co-branded projects - there are a lot of them now, and together with the standard card features you can get some additional amenities. <br>  What other banking products and services would you like to read? </div>
