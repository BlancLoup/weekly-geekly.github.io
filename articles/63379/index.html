  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Work searches</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Working at the old place, I began to look for a new job in Moscow ... <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Unfortunately, (or vice versa, fortunately) the search period came at the very height of the crisis: the end of winter is the beginning of spring.  Quite a lot had to be like an interview.  I was looking for a place as a system administrator in a mid-sized company with 50 - 300 jobs.  The main operating system for me is Linux.  Due to the specifics of the work, Microsoft is also familiar with the products of Microsoft quite well.  Accordingly, I was looking for a job somehow related to Linux. <br>  At once I will say, the attitude towards Linux when applying for a job is quite ambiguous. <br>  And so, in the process of these walkings, quite interesting observations were made with equally interesting conclusions. <br>  In the process of communicating with the administrators of the companies where I was, a certain classification was developed of these same administrators who will interview you: <br>  <b>Warm spot</b> - Admins in such offices stopped in their development.  He has his own patrimony, in which he is the sovereign master.  The word "swamp" is very appropriate here.  Naturally, on all computers in this organization is Windows.  They write a lot and in detail in the job description, who they need, and what it should be able to do.  At the interview, it turns out that they need a boy with no experience (who will work here for a penny a year and go on to grow).  Linux is required there at the level: "Well, I put ubuntu in a virtual machine at home, and then I took it down."  When you start talking about yourself and he realizes that you REALLY KNOW, horror appears in his eyes.  The interview on this can be considered finished. <br>  <b>The smartest</b> is very close to the previous type.  ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt need clever men in the department‚Äù <br>  <b>Corporate policy</b> - ‚Äúwe use only Microsoft, this is our standard and we wanted to spit on your Linux‚Äù.  On the one hand, the corporate standard in IT is just fine, I use this approach with both hands.  Usually it is present in fairly large companies.  But on the other hand, such an approach gives rise to a very narrow and inflexible policy.  Although on the third hand, Microsoft is almost always unification, including among admins.  Whereas, in Linux, a relationship is seen everywhere: whoever he wants, he does such a <s>jerk</s> , and without sane in-house documentation (which is, again, rare), debugging other people's configs is a painful and lengthy task.  So long that it's easier sometimes to demolish everything and set up from scratch. <br>  <b>I hate Linux</b> - ‚Äúhere we had a previous admin, there were a few servaks left of him.  Now there is only a gateway on Redhat, which is why we indicated Linux in the vacancy.  But we will get rid of it. ‚Äù <br>  <b>Looking for a successor</b> - the most sane type of the above.  Usually he knows what he wants from the candidate, asks specific questions.  As a rule, he is one admin in his company.  Most often the situation arises when he "grows" out of his firm.  Opposed to the first type.  These always have a balance between free and proprietary software. <br>  Of course, this list is far from complete.  He collects in himself only the main types. <br><br>  This is not nagging and certainly not an attempt to develop another holivar. <br>  The fact is that the practice of job search has shown who needs where and how they are treated. <br>  Draw your own conclusions. <br><br>  -
