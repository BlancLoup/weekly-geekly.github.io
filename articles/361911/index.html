  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Android: Stay together. Not the same</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Good things happen when everyone is invited.  A few years ago, we had the idea that phones (and things that were not even invented, such as tablets and smart watches) can be much more interesting if we can create them together.  And we created Android as an open platform, and offered it to everyone to dream, invent, create, or buy anything. <br><br>  Since then, all kinds of people ‚Äî from big and small companies to people on Kickstarter, children in schools, and incredible smart developers ‚Äî have constantly been created faster, <i>together</i> , more than we could have done alone.  And the best part is that every time someone joins, everything becomes more interesting, unexpected and wonderful for all of us. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/AD-oCSoI9OQ%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700022,15700186,15700191,15700248,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhj5E2Xq-Zqp0k3gkdro1yew5Lsu-g" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Inviting everyone is in line with the spirit of <a href="http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2014/09/for-next-five-billion-android-one.html">Android One</a> ‚Äî a program recently launched in India (soon expected in other countries) to make great smartphones available to billions of people around the world who are not yet online.  That's why we are very excited about Lollipop, the latest version of our software, which is designed to meet the diverse needs of the billions of people who already use Android today.

      <b>Join: Android 5.0 Lollipop</b> <br>  As <a href="http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2014/06/google-io-2014-keynote.html">shown</a> on Google I / O, Lollipop is our largest, most ambitious Android release with over 5,000 new APIs for developers.  Lollipop is designed to be flexible, to work on all devices and be customizable for you as you see fit. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/3eb/c43/e2a/3ebc43e2a1c815bdafe401af4b7ff198.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Lollipop is made for a world in which movement during the day means interaction with a bunch of different screens, from phones and tablets to televisions.  From most devices connected together, you expect them to just work.  With Lollipop, continuing from the point where you left off is easier than ever, so you can immediately use songs, photos, apps, and even recent search queries from one of your Android devices in everyone else. <br><br>  When you switch from one screen to another, the environment should behave accordingly.  So Lollipop has the appropriate design for different devices - the approach that we call <a href="http://www.google.com/design">Material Design</a> .  Now content reacts to touches, or even your voice, in more intuitive ways, making transitions between tasks more familiar. <br><br>  Lollipop also gives you more control over the device.  Now you can adjust the parameters so that only certain people and notifications can break through, for example, when you are having dinner or at an important meeting.  And when an important notification appears, you can see it right on the lock screen. <br><br>  And since we use our devices a lot more, now there is a new battery saving feature that allows you to extend the life of your device up to 90 minutes - this is useful if you are far from an outlet.  We also made several user accounts and guest mode to keep your personal belongings safe.  And now you can protect your device with a PIN code, password, pattern, or even by connecting your phone with a trusted device, for example, a watch or a car with Smart-Lock.  But this is only a small part of the Lollipop.  Learn more at <a href="http://android.com/">android.com</a> . <br><br>  <b>Meet the Nexus family working on Lollipop</b> <br>  Advances in technology occur at the intersection of hardware and software.  That is why we always present <a href="http://google.com/nexus">Nexus devices</a> at the same time as the platform release.  Instead of creating software separately, we work with device manufacturers to build Nexus devices to help push the boundaries of what's possible.  Nexus devices also serve as the basis for the ecosystem that is evolving with our new release.  And for Lollipop, we have several new Nexus that we share with you. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/b69/a45/411/b69a4541118313154a7fa95dc0bf6464.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  First, together with Motorola, we developed the <a href="http://google.com/nexus/6">Nexus 6</a> .  This new phone has a raised aluminum frame, a 6-inch Quad HD display and a 13 megapixel camera.  The large screen is complemented by dual front stereo speakers, which provide high-quality sound, which makes it suitable for watching movies and games, and for doing work.  It also has a Turbo Charger, so you can get up to six hours of use after 15 minutes of charging. <br><br>  Next, a new tablet built in partnership with HTC.  <a href="http://www.google.com/nexus/9">The Nexus 9</a> , with embossed metal sides and an 8.9-inch screen, is small enough to be easily carried in one hand, but large enough to work.  And as more and more people want to use the convenience of the tablet when doing real work, we developed a keyboard that is attached by magnets to the Nexus 9, has two different positions and will reliably kneel like a laptop. <br><br>  Finally, we are releasing the first Android TV device: the <a href="http://google.com/nexus/player">Nexus Player</a> , made with Asus, is a streaming media player for movies, music and video.  It is also the first of its kind Android gaming device.  With Nexus Player, you can start playing games on your HDTV with a gamepad, then continue playing on your phone while you are on the go.  Nexus Player is Google Cast Ready, so you can send your favorite entertainment from almost any Chromebook or Android or iOS phone or tablet to your TV. <br><br>  Nexus 9 and Nexus Player will be available for pre-order on October 17 and in stores starting November 3.  Nexus 6 will be available for pre-order at the end of October and in stores in November - an unlocked version through the Play Store or a monthly contract or installment plan through operators, including AT &amp; T, Sprint, T-Mobile, US Cellular and Verizon.  Device distribution requires certification completion and is subject to change.  Visit <a href="http://google.com/nexus">google.com/nexus</a> for more information on availability. <br><br>  Android 5.0 Lollipop, which is installed on the Nexus 6, Nexus 9 and Nexus Player, will also be available on Nexus 4, 5, 7, 10 and Google Play-based device options in the coming weeks. <br><br>  <b>The party is just beginning</b> <br>  With this version of Android Lollipop, we are happy to continue working with our community of developers, hardware partners, and all of you.  More ideas and more creators are what lead us to better ideas faster.  And since everyone is invited to a party, we hope that you will join in the <a href="http://www.androidify.com/">fun of creating and sharing an Android character</a> that contains a small piece of you.  Enjoy! <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/TRmgMe2STL0%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700022,15700186,15700191,15700248,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhhI2ka2LyROIMJPXLqImLYcZndj_w" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/361911/">https://habr.com/ru/post/361911/</a></p>
