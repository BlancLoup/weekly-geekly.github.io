It is clear that the best experience is participation in projects and tampering with our own cones in practice, but still, theory is also important.  In this article we will explain how and where it is better to learn Splunk. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h2>  1.

      The book covers many of the topics that you will encounter when working in Splunk, from data loading to creating advanced analytic reports using XML and Python languages.  In the book on each topic there is a step by step instruction with screenshots. <br><br>  You can download it <a href="http://www.pavleck.net/bookinfo/splunk-operational-intelligence-cookbook-over-70-practical-recipes-to-gain-operational-da.pdf/">here.</a> <br><br>  <b>Implementing Splunk Big Data Reporting and Development for Operational Intelligence</b> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/ru/8d/kd/ru8dkd-wf3lp_s4ozmh-p5imr1c.png" width="300" height="411"><br><br>  This book is in many ways similar to the previous one in terms of the presentation structure with practical examples, but it is less about simple and focuses on ‚Äúadvanced‚Äù methods of search, visualization, configuration of the Splunk architecture, and so on. <br><br>  You can download it <a href="https://github.com/hayderimran7/free-tech-ebooks-from-packtpub/blob/master/Implementing%2520Splunk%2520Big%2520Data%2520Reporting%2520and%2520Development%2520for%2520Operational%2520Intelligence/9781849693288-IMPLEMENTING_SPLUNK_BIG_DATA_REPORTING_AND_DEVEL.pdf">here.</a> <br><br>  <b>Exploring Splunk Search Processing Language (SPL) Primer And Cookbook</b> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/yn/u_/jo/ynu_joddf_luiyxhkeaixthbgqa.png" width="300" height="411"><br><br>  This book focuses on query building and SPL query language: logic, functions, syntax. <br><br>  You can download it <a href="https://www.splunk.com/pdfs/ebooks/exploring-splunk.pdf">here</a> . <br><br>  It should be noted that there is nothing new in the books that you will not find in the official documentation, links to which will be in the next section, some functions can already be changed in new versions of Splunk and the current information is better to look there, but still, books information is presented in a simpler and more user-friendly (especially beginner) format. <br><br><h2>  2. Useful materials and sites </h2><br>  <b>Manuals Splunk Enterprise</b> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/uy/zz/_a/uyzz_aiaa8l4n9gnpq5hdqhngak.png"><br><br>  The most basic source from which you can get all the latest information about working in Splunk.  Everything that can be implemented in Splunk can be found here: instructions for downloading different types of data from various sources, detailed help for each function of the SPL language, instructions for all methods of visualization and reporting, guidance for system administration, troubleshooting, and so on.  Each page has several versions depending on which version of Splunk you need. <br><br>  Among the disadvantages of this guide, I would like to note that there is too much information there to easily find exactly what you need (especially if you are a novice user), as well as a complex system of hyperlinks from one topic to another.  Our advice: if you fall into a section, do not try to study it from the middle and look for answers to questions in different parts - read the section completely.  Yes, it will take more time, but there will be much more understanding. <br><br>  <a href="http://docs.splunk.com/Documentation/Splunk">Link to resource</a> <br><br>  <b>Splunk Quick Reference Guide</b> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/dc/qs/d7/dcqsd7ox8t_pnunultsfrxlshqs.png" width="300" height="411"><br><br>  A small review on 6 pages, in which the definitions of the basic concepts of the system, as well as the syntax of the language SPL.  Usually we use it as a desktop ‚Äúchitshit‚Äù, since the most common commands are gathered there. <br><br>  <a href="https://www.splunk.com/pdfs/solution-guides/splunk-quick-reference-guide.pdf">Link to resource</a> <br><br>  <b>Splunk answers</b> <br><br>  A forum in which users ask questions to other users about various difficulties in their work.  If you have a problem, but for sure you can find a ready-made solution there or independently ask a question.  The main advantage of this forum is that the staff of the splana monitor and apryvyat correct answers.  And there you can win a ticket to the annual conference splunk.conf for high karma. <br><br>  <a href="https://answers.splunk.com/answers/index.html">Link to resource</a> <br><br>  <b>Splunk blog</b> <br><br>  The blog contains many articles about trends in the field of information technology and how Splunk is associated with them.  It is here that the real cases of using Splunk and various ‚Äúbest practices‚Äù are published, and the articles are written by pretty pumped up spunkers.  However, there, as in all blogs, there are also marketing articles, without them. <br><br>  <a href="https://www.splunk.com/blog/homepage.html">Link to resource</a> <br><br>  <b>Articles on Habr√©</b> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/q3/95/ym/q395yml6dqo0vmtp34sz2vvn42c.png"><br><br>  We regularly publish articles related to the work of Splunk.  Instructions for working with the system, integration with other systems and various reviews.  We keep a complete list for easy navigation <a href="https://habr.com/company/tssolution/blog/358734/">here</a> , it is constantly updated. <br><br><h2>  3. Video </h2><br>  If someone is too lazy to read, then you can watch.  Below we have posted links to various channels with video content.  Perhaps the video is a little long, but for there you can see which buttons and how to press. <br><br>  <b>Official educational videos on the site</b> -&gt; <a href="https://www.splunk.com/en_us/training/videos/all-videos.html">link</a> <br><br>  <b>Youtube channel Splunk</b> -&gt; <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/splunkvideos">link</a> <br><br>  <b>Youtube channel Splunk How-to</b> -&gt; <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCjwOFZzLPnji1EstaVyyvAw">link</a> <br><br>  <b>Our video</b> <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/CBYj6X7y1RM" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><h2>  4.
