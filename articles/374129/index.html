In fact, a UFO, an unidentified flying object, is any object that is difficult to identify.  UFOs can be called, for example, an aircraft that flies in such a way that its model is simply impossible to recognize. <br><br>  It has now become known that the Pentagon <a href="https://futurism.com/pentagon-secret-ufos-program/">spent</a> about 10 years (2002-2012) and $ 22 million studying various UFOs. This was an unofficial program for detecting aviation threats.  That is, the military did not search for brothers in mind, but simply tried to find out how great the threat of destruction or damage to the aircraft in the air as a result of the impact of a UFO (for example, a collision). <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Reportedly, the program began to be implemented by the Americans in part because they heard rumors about launching similar projects from China.  Of course, the United States wanted to be the first.  The initiator of the creation of the American program was the representative of the Democratic Party in the US Senate, Harry Reid.  Congressmen at one time attached great importance to the fact that they represent a UFO, which sometimes came into the lens of not only an amateur camera, but also the field of view of military pilots.  According to the instructions in 2002, an employee of the United States Air Force, who noticed a UFO, was supposed to document and transfer ‚Äúupward‚Äù data on replacement objects.

      During the existence of this program has been received a lot of photos and videos.  But most of the videos looked about the same.  The UFO was at one point in the frame, and then moved quickly, disappearing from the operator‚Äôs field of view.  Some such frames, as it turned out, are fake.  Others are quite real.  But on them (fortunately or unfortunately) there are not alien spaceships, but objects that have contaminated camera lenses.  In addition, some of the documented phenomena can be explained by glare in optics. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/c29/ae3/ad7/c29ae3ad7a78eebd38498d3ecb4b9f8f.jpg"><br>  <i>What to do, some materials in addition still not too high quality</i> <br><br>  In some other cases, such effects may be associated with contamination of the lenses or their defect.  For example, the part of the light that passes through the camera can be reflected inside the lens, forming its own image, which falls on a matrix or film.  The reflection is due to the presence of extremely small dust particles or water droplets in the lens. <br><br>  The phenomenon itself has been known for a long time - the first was described by the Soviet physicist Alexanadr Mikirov.  He explained, for example, the appearance of a certain luminous object in a photograph, which was taken in the 1960s at the polar station in Tiksi.  Mikirov did not just formulate the hypothesis of the appearance of a ‚Äúflying saucer‚Äù, but empirically proved his point of view.  He was able to get pictures of UFOs that are almost identical to those that were presented as the existence of an alien mind on Earth. <br><br><div class="oembed"><twitter-widget class="twitter-tweet twitter-tweet-rendered" id="twitter-widget-0" style="position: absolute; visibility: hidden; display: block; transform: rotate(0deg);"></twitter-widget><blockquote class="twitter-tweet twitter-tweet-error" align="center" data-twitter-extracted-i1551856995963301296="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">  Let's talk about this awesome.

Not only "saucers", but also cigar-shaped systems, whirlpool, ovals, rhombuses or balls.  Interestingly, as the photo and video technology evolves, the glare remains in place. <br><br>  But not only the glare led to the appearance of non-existent objects in the pictures.  In many cases, UFOs are taken by clouds of a special form, quite earthly aircraft or space debris. <br><br>  ‚ÄúImagine, a piece of iron flies from space.  Some parts of a ship or something.  It consists of both aluminum, and titanium, and steel.  The whole complex.  First, of course, aluminum will be boiled with titanium, then it will come to steel.  What form will this thing take, and where will it ricochet off the atmosphere - up or down, left to right?  And clearly perfectly - in front of me a UFO, the real one, shines, flies.  It seems to be burning with something.  And disappeared quickly, ‚Äù <a href="https://www.vesti.ru/doc.html%3Fid%3D2967469">said</a> honored test pilot of the USSR Viktor Zabolotsky about his‚Äú meeting ‚Äùwith a UFO. <br><br>  Some objects shot by someone earlier are difficult to explain from the point of view of science and common sense.  But this does not mean that such an explanation does not exist.  Most often it turns out that it lies on the surface, and the object itself is modeled by some joker.  Whatever it was, the program also completed its tasks: first, it proved that there were no green men on Earth, and second, it allowed the military to clarify which objects could meet with airplanes and other aircraft in the sky.  True, it took $ 20 million to figure out all this. On the other hand, just for the US military, this is a very small amount, so taxpayers have nothing to worry about. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/374129/">https://habr.com/ru/post/374129/</a></p>
