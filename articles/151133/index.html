In place of the good old BugZilla came advanced-fancy <a href="http://www.atlassian.com/software/jira/overview">JIRA</a> . <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/796/793/acb/796793acb54fd9affb6d8bb04f4fe25a.png" alt="image" align="right"><br>  JIRA can be viewed as the next stage in the development of Bagzilla, and the de facto error tracking system that has become the standard that is used in major companies - and the prices on the Atlassian website are hinted at.  But, for open projects, the system can be used absolutely free of charge and without restrictions, for which a special thank you to them.  For ReactOS, Bugzilla is a ‚Äúbugtracker‚Äù, while JIRA is an issue tracker.  The difference is that with the help of JIRA, you can deal not only with tracking errors, but also with scheduling tasks, tracking development progress and creating a development plan (roadmap). <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  With this last point in ReactOS, I was strained all the time, and that was what drove Alexei Bragin in the direction of the inevitable swift introduction of JIRA.  This makes it possible to raise the development process to a new level, to plan and track work from the beginning to ‚Äúversion 1.0‚Äù

      The funny fact is that the Apache Software Foundation (a Bugzilla developer) switched to JIRA, which is also "as if hinting". <br><br><h4>  <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/148950/">The first contract was</a> successfully completed and extended. </h4><br>  The contract concluded with Edijs Kolesnikovics was completed in full. <br><br>  For all applications from the <a href="http://www.reactos.org/wiki/Testing_Central">Gold List</a> , tests were created to assess the correctness of their installation. <br><br>  The ReactOS project is pleased to announce the extension of the contract with Edijs Kolesnikovics to develop tests for the AutoHotkey automated testing system.  Amine Khaldi (Amine Khaldi), supervisor of the previous contract, was extremely satisfied with Edijs previous work, and offered to extend the contract, which would give Edius more time to develop new tests.  The purpose of the first contract was to test the installation of applications and verify their basic functionality, as well as small improvements to the testing environment itself.  The extension of the contract is intended to add additional tests for applications that are being tested in preparation for the release of a new release, in addition, if Ediys has enough time, additional tests will be created for applications from the ‚ÄúGolden Applications‚Äù list. <br><br>  <i>Contract details</i> <i><br></i>  <i>Time: at least 84 hours</i> <i><br></i>  <i>Payment: 168 ‚Ç¨</i> <i><br></i>  <i>Expected duration: 1 month</i> <br><br>  Objective: During the specified period of time, develop as many AHK test scripts as possible for automated regression testing of application health in ReactOS.  The preferred goal is to obtain as detailed tests as possible for all applications that are being tested when preparing a new release for release.  If there is enough time, additional tests will be created for applications from the ‚ÄúGold Applications‚Äù list. <br><br><h4>  Second contract </h4><br>  The ReactOS project is pleased to announce a new contract with the ReactOS developer, this time with James Tabor, one of the long-time ReactOS developers who actively worked on the Win32 subsystem.  Jim intends to tackle a large number of old errors, and, we hope, will be able to significantly reduce the number of problems currently present in the Win32 subsystem and remaining unresolved.  As you can see, the purpose of this contract is to correct errors and problems in ReactOS, and not to add new features and capabilities. <br><br>  <i>Contract details</i> <i><br></i>  <i>Time: 120 hours</i> <i><br></i>  <i>Payment: 720 ‚Ç¨</i> <i><br></i>  <i>Duration: 1 month</i> <br><br>  Purpose: The initial candidates for correction during the contract period are the following errors: 7225, 7107, 7065, 7037, 6759, 6268, 6266, 5443, 5320, 5095, 4778, 4251, and 3624. If there is enough time, the list will be expanded. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/242/36b/f26/24236bf2627570ded0c4c9db64c8ae2e.jpg" align="right"><h4>  Moaar contracts are coming ... </h4><br>  <b>Warning!</b>  I am waiting for a summary of all who wish to participate in the project for a fee on the address <br>  <b>art1st-tm yandex ru</b> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/151133/">https://habr.com/ru/post/151133/</a></p>
