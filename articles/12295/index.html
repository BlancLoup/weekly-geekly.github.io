  <section class="page js-page"><h1>United business organization</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  <strong>The unpredictable Belarusian legislation encouraged the participants of the telecommunications market of Belarus to create an association, the main task of which is ‚Äúcivilized lobbying of legislation‚Äù.</strong>  <strong>For the time being, the founders of Belinfoc do not really know how the activity of a public organization will be conducted, but the plans are big.</strong> <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Andrei Nareiko, chairman of the board of Belinfokom, general director of <em>Professional Systems</em> LLC, spoke to journalists at the national press center;  Deputy Chairman of the Board of Belinfocom, General Director of Trusted Programs (TUT.BY), Yuri Zisser;  representative of the founder of Belinfocom, deputy director of Alternative Digital Network Alexander Homichenko, and another representative of the founder of Belinfokom, deputy general director of Svyazinformservice Dmitry Korolev.  Actually, there were government officials: the head of the telecommunications department of the Ministry of Communications and Informatization, Yury Shpak, two deputies of the House of Representatives of the National Assembly of the Republic of Belarus, Vitaly Kulik and Nikolay Kutsko, head of the department for ensuring the activities of the Standing Committee of the House of Representatives for Industry, Fuel and Energy Complex, Transport Communications and Sergey Brekhov and Advisor Advisor of the Department for the Maintenance of the Standing Committee of the House of Representatives on  and, fuel and energy complex, transport communications and entrepreneurship Zinaida Korovchenko. <br><br>  ‚ÄúThe voluntary association of legal entities working in the telecommunications market of the Republic of Belarus‚Äù described its plans, tasks and methods with abstract expressions devoid of any specifics.  Only Zisser comfortably remarked on this occasion: ‚ÄúMr. Nareiko is an ex-deputy, he has great connections in parliament, and for this they established themselves.‚Äù  To which the chairman of the board emphasized: ‚ÄúWe do not set political goals for ourselves,‚Äù adding later: ‚Äú‚Äú We have created an organization capable of conducting a constructive dialogue with government bodies. ‚Äù  Journalists asked the dumb question: ‚ÄúWhy is it necessary at all?‚Äù Zisser replied in his monologue: ‚ÄúThis will be the most democratic Association of all, because the Infopark and the HTP have terrible restrictions, that is, only those who claim can enter on tax breaks. "  In Belinfokom, the founders plan to invite everyone: from large companies to Ipshinki, if only everyone works in the field of IT.  At the same time, the speakers did not forget to mention the hopes that ‚Äúsoon‚Äú Beltelecom will be with us ‚Äùand‚Äú mobile operators essentially agree ‚Äù.  What is interesting is that the work of the association will be supported by quarterly membership dues - it will be necessary to maintain a small staff of qualified lawyers and an administrative resource.  At the same time, all members of the association will have the same voting right - be it MTS, one of the founders, or an individual entrepreneur selling computers.  The expected role in the organization of Beltelecom remained unclear: the state operator is unlikely to defend the members of the association against the often tough bills in relation to the Belarusian IT business.  The most intelligible explanation that was voiced in an informal conversation during the buffet was: ‚ÄúThey just didn‚Äôt want to quarrel.‚Äù  In the meantime, the question of whether a state monopolist will participate in Belinfokom is hard to say.  Naturally, the tasks and methods with which the organization will operate, depending on this important factor, may differ dramatically. <br><br>  Since the issues did not diminish after the press conference, I decided to clarify the plans of the association directly from Andrei Nareiko. <br>  - <strong>Why do we need this organization?</strong>  <strong>Do you really believe that a public organization can somehow influence the changes in the Belarusian legislation?</strong> <br>  - Yes it is possible.  The fact is that all questions are solved together on behalf of the association much easier.  For example, all operators are concerned about the allocation of radio frequencies.  If MTS representatives come to the officials and try to prove something, no one will listen to them at all, dismissing: ‚ÄúYou are a private company and you lobby your own interests.‚Äù  But if together we make our decisions, then our requests will already be considered as the requests of a number of market participants.  If MTS and Velcom will be in the association, then they will not be able to brush it off - it will be clear that this problem interests all market participants, which means that it actually exists.  It is much easier to negotiate with the government on behalf of a public organization. <br>  - A <strong>lot was said here about the possible admission to membership of Beltelecom, although Atlant Telecom is among the founders - its direct competitor ...</strong> <br>  - We would not like the association to become an object of competition between those who are in it and who are not.  Competition in the market is one thing, market development is another.  We want together with Beltelecom, as a company whose opinion in the government is being listened to, to work with us in the direction of market development.  They said that we could compete with BTK, i.e.  try to remove from the market a state monopolist.  But Alexander Khomichenko correctly remarked: ‚ÄúIf this monopoly does not exist, then large foreign companies, Moscow and European, will immediately bite on the tidbit of the telecommunication services market.  And it's not a fact that without BTK it will be better. ‚Äù <br>  - <strong>Your organization looks somewhat utopian: both an entrepreneur and a large company with millions of turns will have the same voting right.</strong>  <strong>Are you not afraid that the work of the association from such excessive democracy will be ineffective?</strong>  <strong>You don‚Äôt have to go far for an example - the UN is rapidly losing its political weight ...</strong> <br>  - We have only a week (the organization was registered at the Ministry of Justice on July 5, the conversation took place on the 12th - Ed.), So it‚Äôs too early to talk about global perspectives.  Of course, if the association grows, certain amendments to the charter will have to be made.  The same can be said with regard to membership fees: the ipeshnik cannot subsidize an association to the same extent as one of the founders!  But so far there are only four members of the association and they all have equal voting rights.  BTK will have one vote, if they want to join us, and MTS.  But in the future, in order to improve the efficiency of decision-making within the association, adjustments are possible.  We will work and discuss these nuances in working order.

      Will Belinfokom a powerful tool for upholding the interests of IT business in government circles, time will tell.  In the meantime, the very fact that ‚Äúfinally got together‚Äù and ‚Äúat least something should work out‚Äù warms everyone. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/12295/">https://habr.com/ru/post/12295/</a></p>
