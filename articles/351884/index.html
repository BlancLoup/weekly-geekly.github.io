  <section class="page js-page"><h1>This is not ‚Äúa real job, but a better job‚Äù: as a hiring policy, Crossover allows you to pay employees above the market</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Now the global community of Crossover has more than 4,000 developers and professionals of other specialties in <a href="https://www.crossover.com/about-us/">138 countries of the world</a> .  Of these, more than 400 people live and work in Russia.  And this means that, thanks to Crossover, the Russian economy has received four hundred individual entrepreneurs (IP).  And then you say: ‚ÄúStop, but where did the IP come from?‚Äù The fact is that Crossover in Russia has neither an office, nor even a legal entity - like anywhere else in the world, except for the headquarters in Austin, Texas.  All employees work completely remotely.  The fact is that Crossover in Russia does not hire employees, but cooperates with local individual entrepreneurs.  Sounds unusual?  Probably yes.  Maybe we still simply did not appreciate all the possibilities of such a work format, and in fact he has a whole carriage of advantages over traditional hire.  However, as well as a small cart of defects, about which we will also tell. <br><br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/hh/jb/hy/hhjbhywgqayetbei-hb1ivghtoq.png"></a> <br><br><h2>  How is cooperation with Crossover organized? </h2><br>  Imagine that one of the Crossover tournaments, about which there was already a <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/company/crossover/blog/351328/">detailed story last time</a> , was left behind for the applicant: with an excellent passing score, he found himself in the Crossover showcase, a marketplace, where he soon received a specific job offer in one of the companies of ESW Capital holding - Aurea, Versata, DevFactory, 3seventy, Ignite Technologies, etc. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Now, in order to take up his duties, he needs to register as an IP.  This model of interaction was not chosen by chance: instead of opening hundreds of physical offices and representative offices around the world, Crossover interacts with employees completely remotely and has a decentralized structure.  From the point of view of geography - this is a definite plus.  A developer can physically be at least in Moscow, even beyond the Arctic Circle: the main thing is that he has access to the Internet.  For the rest, only immediate skills affect his chances of getting a job, but not the place of birth and / or residence.  This allows you to attract talented people to projects without requiring them to move, and also significantly save on offices, rentals and other expenses related to the maintenance of premises.

      <br>
      So what about the design as a PI?  Since cooperation with Crossover and other companies of the parent holding ESW Capital takes the form of contractual relations between two legal entities, a ‚Äúfull set‚Äù of documents will be required. <br><br><ol><li>  Register IP. </li><li>  Registration with the tax inspectorate. </li><li>  The choice of the tax system. </li><li>  Current account in the bank. </li><li>  A contract with a contractor in the face of Crossover. </li></ol><br>  The company always helps every specialist with registration in the form of consultations and instructions - even if they always went around their tax inspection per kilometer, you do not know anything about taxation and you are not oriented in all the intricacies of paperwork at the registration stage, they will not leave you alone in trouble.  Specifically for Russia, special instructions have been developed that contain a step-by-step action plan.  With such instructions it will be easier to avoid holes and potholes on the bureaucratic road to the PI. <br><br>  And now in more detail. <br><br>  It all starts with registering as an IP.  Now it is done very simply, it‚Äôs enough to appear in tax once, the deadline for registration is up to 3 business days.  Our instruction will tell you which documents to submit and how to choose and arrange the appropriate tax system (this should be done immediately upon registration).  On the Internet, you can pre-read detailed <a href="https://www.regberry.ru/registraciya-ip/registraciya-ip-samostoyatelno">tutorials on registration of individual entrepreneurs</a> , but our instructions are already adapted to the upcoming activities. <br><br>  Next - registration in the bank current account to which payments will be received.  Everything is clear and additionally does not make sense to paint. <br><br>  The contract with Crossover is concluded without an end date and is made out in electronic form, and the contract itself from the IP side is accepted on the basis of a public offer. <br><br><h2>  Salary </h2><br>  Since Crossover is a company, in fact, an American, part of the Texas holding ESW Capital, it has an American model of remuneration, in which the advance and salary, which are usual for our latitudes, are replaced with weekly payments.  In general, all work will revolve around a 40-hour work week, instead of a larger and more volatile ‚Äúmonth‚Äù. <br><br>  Payments are organized through <a href="https://www.payoneer.com/ru/">Payoneer</a> , an international <a href="https://www.payoneer.com/ru/">payment service</a> already familiar to many freelancers.  To receive money for poison, QIWI or Webmoney will not work: these options are in principle poorly suited for cross-border calculations.  You can bind the account number to your Payoneer account and set up automatic withdrawal, i.e.  use it as a "gateway".  Initially payments are made in dollars, but you can choose automatic conversion into Russian rubles.  For this conversion, however, you will have to pay 2% commission. <br><br><h2>  Schedule, vacation, sick leave </h2><br>  In addition to maintaining accounting and self-paying taxes, IP also shoulders the rationing of one‚Äôs own working day, planning vacations and accumulating those same ‚Äúvacation pay‚Äù. <br><br>  In the case of the organization of labor in the Crossover is slightly easier than in other piece-distant work.  It is expected that in collaboration with the company, the developer or manager will work 40 hours per calendar week.  If the work process does not require close interaction with other team members, then the distribution of these 40 hours remains solely at the discretion of the employee and his manager.  So, you can stretch the "pleasure" for all seven calendar days and work without days off at all, but you can "compress" the working week to four days. <br><br>  In general, the schedule is consistent with the manager of the team and some comfortable parity is sought for all interested parties.  Therefore, let it be necessary to work 40 hours, this does not mean work ‚Äúfrom 9 to 18‚Äù, but there are positions, such as <a href="https://app.crossover.com/x/redirect/job/3330%3Futm_campaign%3DRUhabr">Customer Support Architect</a> , when you have to adjust to the time of mandatory presence. <br><br>  As for the holidays.  If you pay attention to the form of remuneration in the ‚Äú <a href="https://app.crossover.com/x/marketplace/available-jobs%3Futm_campaign%3DRUhabr">Jobs</a> ‚Äù section, you will notice that the payment for the year is calculated on the basis of 50 working weeks rather than 52. Two weeks of vacation per year are already included in the annual payment.  A longer rest is made out in agreement with the manager in the form of a break in cooperation - at the expense of the IP itself, but the level of payment in the Crossover implies that he can afford it. <br><br>  Approximately the same principle of coordinating absence applies in case of illness.  In cases of lung diseases that ‚Äúknock out‚Äù for a couple of days, you can negotiate with the manager to reduce the number of hours or ‚Äúshift‚Äù the labor activity relative to the usual approved schedule (if you do not want to lose money).  This takes into account the specifics of the project and the position at which you work.  The same Customer Support Architect has a clear schedule, it needs an urgent replacement, and where there is no such dependence on the hours of presence, the approach is more flexible.  If you need more time to improve your health, a temporary break in work is consistent (just as with a vacation).  References, respectively, also do not need to issue.  Accustomed to paid leave and sick leave for people, this may scare away - but such is the difference between employment and business. <br><br>  Now is the time to move on to what all this people need: actual income. <br><br><h2>  Some entertaining tax mathematics </h2><br>  For clarity, let us compare two situations using the example of the entry level <a href="https://app.crossover.com/x/redirect/job/3369%3Futm_campaign%3DRUhabr">QA Manual Tester</a> , which offers $ 20,000 a year in the Crossover (1,145,000–Ç ‚Ñ¢ at the current rate).  According to vacancies on hh.ru in Moscow, the average salary for this position is 40-60 thousand, by region - from 20 thousand rubles per month. <br><br>  Suppose a certain LLC Ordinary Software Company allocated the same $ 20,000 a year in its budget for a similar position as a tester / specialist in manual testing, having whom it can start looking for an employee for a salary of no more than 73400 per month, because 30% is on top already pledged for compulsory insurance medical and pension contributions for an employee.  At the same time, the accounting department will take care of the income tax for the employee. <br>  <b>Total on hand: ~ 64 000‚ÇΩ</b> . <br><br>  SP, of course, is surrounded in this sense by far less concern.  He receives all the money earned in full, being responsible for paying taxes and contributions on his own.  Is it worth it?  Let's get a look.  The individual entrepreneur, working under a contract with Crossover, will receive all of $ 20,000 per year to his bank account - <b>1,122,000RUR per year</b> , including conversion.  Add to the bank charges the content of the account itself - its value varies from bank to bank, but on average you can navigate to <b>¬£ 12,000 per year</b> .  As for taxes and contributions, then the PI can decide for itself how it is more profitable for it: <br><br>  <b>Choosing work on the simplified taxation system (USN) with payment of 6% of income</b> , which in this example, taking into account insurance pension and medical contributions, will be, roundly, 76000‚ÇΩ per year.  Leaving our <a href="https://app.crossover.com/x/redirect/job/3369%3Futm_campaign%3DRUhabr">QA Manual Tester</a> on hand ~ 1 034 000‚ÇΩ per year. <br>  <b>Total on hand: ~ 86 000‚ÇΩ</b> . <br><br>  <b>By purchasing a fixed patent for a year.</b>  The patent system of taxation was introduced only in 2015 and makes it possible to replace the ‚Äúpostpaid‚Äù procedure of paying taxes to the ‚Äúprepaid‚Äù, in the form of buying a patent at a fixed price for a year.  In this case, except for the patent itself, the IP will only have a final pension contribution of 1% of earnings over 300,000QR per year. <br><br>  The cost of patents may vary tenfold, depending on the type of activity and the region in which the individual entrepreneur conducts business.  For example, in St. Petersburg, a patent for those who develop computer software costs ¬£ 60,000 for 2018.  And in Moscow - already 300 thousand.  And in the Moscow region - and at all 12500‚ÇΩ.  <s>But never live in Khimki was not so profitable.</s>  This can still be profitable, but already with annual earnings of 5 million rubles - for example, as <a href="https://app.crossover.com/x/redirect/job/3341%3Futm_campaign%3DRUhabr">QA Software Engineer Manager</a> , with whom Crossover offers $ 100,000 (5.7 million rubles) per year.  But the <a href="https://app.crossover.com/x/redirect/job/3369%3Futm_campaign%3DRUhabr">QA Manual Tester</a> , working in St. Petersburg on a patent, could have left this year for itself 1 041 000‚ÇΩ. <br>  <b>Total on hand: ~ 87 000‚ÇΩ</b> . <br><br>  This, of course, does not end the nuances.  But among them - the mass of pleasant, like tax holidays for newly-made entrepreneurs.  For example, in the Leningrad region, where Chief Software Architect Ruslan Peshchuk lives, the opening IPs are exempted from paying the first two years of work: <br><br>  ‚ÄúIndividual entrepreneurs have more opportunities to manage their finances, choose the tax system.  I have been working since July 2017, and I have just tax holidays. ‚Äù <br><br><h2>  The final frontier on the brain drain </h2><br>  Judging by the growing number of professionals working with Crossover, which has doubled over the past two years in Russia and the CIS, the proposed scheme of work is quite viable. <br><br>  Moreover, for many talented specialists this turned out to be the last opportunity to develop professionally and earn decently without the need to ‚Äúleak‚Äù abroad. <br><br><blockquote> The entrance threshold from the point of view of professional level requirements in the Crossover community is quite high, knowledge of English is also a necessary requirement.  In fact, we are talking about high-level specialists;  In addition, the IT environment is progressively thinking people, not holding on to old habits.  From the point of view of finance and development, to go abroad for them is a logical option, especially in small cities, where often there are simply no tough employers.  Crossover collects the best minds, those who could potentially leave, and creates for them the opportunity to stay in their hometown and country, receive significant sums for their work and spend the money in their region, which supports the domestic economy. <br>  <b>- Vladimir Eronin, Director of Crossover in Russia and the CIS</b> </blockquote><br><h3>  In the name of the state </h3><br>  If all of the above still seems to you to be somehow suspicious, then Elena Ivanovna Dugin, Executive Director of <a href="http://kroosp.ru/">the Union of Entrepreneurs,</a> will disagree with you: the Crossover work system is absolutely legal, although not very common in Russia.  Moreover, increasing the number of individual entrepreneurs is one of the priority current tasks in the development of the Russian economy.  As is the case with the suspension of the brain drain, the policy of the company Crossover again turns out, albeit unintentionally, in the vein of the rulemaker. <br><br><h2>  Who are these people choosing Crossover? </h2><br>  In general, it is possible to form a portrait of an ‚Äúaverage‚Äù specialist cooperating with Crossover.  These are specialists: <br><br><ul><li>  A variety of profiles (engineers, developers, testers, managers, analysts, as well as high-level managers), but always - the highest class. </li><li>  Without age restrictions.  Once a mature average team (senior and senior employees for the most part crossed the mark of 30 years) is now getting younger due to the emergence of new junior and middle-level positions. </li><li>  Which came to their position in one of 2 ways: either successfully passing remote testing, as in the <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/company/crossover/blog/348634/">history of VP of Engineering</a> <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/users/slavakulakov/" class="user_link">slavakulakov</a> , or by gaining a passing score in an offline tournament, the principles of organization of which we <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/company/crossover/blog/351328/">told</a> only last week (by the way, on April 7 we will have the <a href="http://xo-link.ru/tourney">next tournament in Moscow!</a> ). </li><li>  They speak English at least at a level sufficient for interaction in an international team (intermediate and higher).  This is an unavoidable condition for working in an internationally distributed team.  Two customers collecting Russian-speaking teams are an exception;  all other teams communicate in English. </li><li>  Which have a high level of self-organization.  Without this, there is simply no way - for any remote control, self-control is required, and the individual entrepreneur should be attentive not only to the content of his work, but also to its formal side (interaction with government agencies, timely payment of taxes and fees). </li><li>  Which are scattered in different regions of Russia.  Only single vacancies are tied to a specific city because of the specifics of the work, for example, we recently had the position of VP of Engineering in Dubai - but the remaining 99% are available for specialists from any region of Russia (or from anywhere in the world). </li><li>  Those who are firmly determined to take responsibility for their working time, rest and sickness time for themselves, choose higher wages instead of lesser responsibility, receive a couple of bonuses in the appendage.  This is an improvement in one‚Äôs own English because of the constant work with both foreigners and native speakers, saving time spent on the way to the office and improving one‚Äôs own professional skills. </li></ul><br><h2>  Last half step "from uncle" </h2><br>  And yet, as shown by one of the studies, for more than half of those who left Crossover, the next stage of development is their own business, and more often without moving from their own region.  This is facilitated by the fact that, in addition to professional skills, a person also gains experience in dealing with tax, accounting, and, of course, the ability to accumulate start-up capital over several years (with an income of about $ 100,000 / year or more - the task is quite feasible).  But the main thing is still not this. <br><br>  Chief Software Architect Evgeny Konurbaev noted the main thing: <br><br><blockquote>  I used to work on trips, and sometimes I take work on weekends if I need to do something on weekdays.  You need to organize yourself, manage your time.  For those who want to develop, this is a plus.  For someone who is not ready to leave the comfort zone, this, of course, is a minus. </blockquote><br>  For those who are ready for such changes - all doors are open.  And many of them are opened by Crossover. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/351884/">https://habr.com/ru/post/351884/</a></p>
