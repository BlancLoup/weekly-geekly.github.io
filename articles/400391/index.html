Guessing with a present even for a loved one is often difficult.  We chose the ten best things for the owner of Sony equipment - first of all, smartphones of the new Xperia line. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/d23/631/3d1/d236313d133c40618ce769fd3e2dda33.jpg"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h2>  Smart assistant Xperia Ear </h2><br>  The <a href="http://www.sonymobile.com/ru/products/smart-products/xperia-ear/">Xperia Ear</a> looks like a modern Bluetooth-headset, but in fact its capabilities are much wider.  This is a smart voice assistant, which is able to completely free your hands when using a smartphone. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/7ec/8dc/b04/7ec8dcb0489144a5827454662f2b6c62.jpg">

    <img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/587/458/6b5/5874586b55f74540a89f24c4e0893022.jpg"><br><br>  The device can read news and text messages, record your words for notes or replies, talk about the weather, get directions to a destination and notify you about new letters.  In addition to voice control, Xperia Ear recognizes head nods as commands to receive a call or hang up.  A great gift for people who, for example, spend a lot of time behind the wheel and can not directly work with a smartphone. <br><br><h2>  Dock station </h2><br>  While charging, smartphones usually lie on bedside tables and desks.  With a docking station, the device will look as if it is a valuable item, specially displayed in a prominent place.  Given the cost of some smartphones, they fully deserve such an attitude. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/812/ddd/62f/812ddd62f37d46759a663a397ee6cb79.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/ffa/101/33c/ffa10133c913478eb6ab3eeedd750b0f.jpg"><br><br>  Sony offers several docking stations for devices with different interfaces - microUSB or the latest USB Type-C standard.  In the first case, you need a model <a href="http://www.sonymobile.com/ru/products/accessories/micro-usb-charging-dock-dk52/">DK52</a> , in the second - <a href="https://www.sonymobile.com/ru/products/accessories/usb-type-c-charging-dock-dk60/">DK60</a> . <br><br><h2>  Bluetooth headset </h2><br>  <a href="https://geektimes.ru/company/sonyxperia/blog/272822/">We told you</a> about this model <a href="https://geektimes.ru/company/sonyxperia/blog/272822/">separately</a> .  The <a href="http://www.sonymobile.com/ru/products/accessories/stereo-bluetooth-headset-sbh54/">SBH54's</a> compact display shows incoming messages, recent calls, songs being played and other useful information. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/bd3/cbc/957/bd3cbc95759f41b4824b732351f3a0a9.jpg"><br><br>  At the same time, you can quickly switch tracks, listen to the radio and make conversations.  In addition, the headset also looks stylish.  The device is offered in black and gold. <br><br><h2>  Wireless speaker </h2><br>  The <a href="http://www.sonymobile.com/ru/products/accessories/bluetooth-speaker-bsp10/">BSP10</a> column <a href="http://www.sonymobile.com/ru/products/accessories/bluetooth-speaker-bsp10/">is</a> deceptive: it looks tiny, but it plays excellently.  The model catches the signal of a smartphone at a distance of up to ten meters - you can walk freely even in a spacious room.  The device has a sophisticated surround sound system so that the sound is distributed evenly throughout the space. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/496/a35/500/496a3550076c4e1598622ba8086695e2.jpg"><br><br>  In addition, the BSP10 has a built-in microphone that allows you to talk on the phone if necessary.  The built-in battery lasts for about ten hours of work, so you can safely take it with you to the cottage or hiking.  It is compact and fits in a small pocket of a backpack. <br><br><h2>  Smart watch </h2><br>  Smart watches are the trend of recent years.  The <a href="http://www.sonymobile.com/ru/products/smart-products/smartwatch-3-swr50/">SmartWatch 3</a> model not only monitors health, but also reports on all important events: letters and messages, news, weather, exchange rates, navigation - you don‚Äôt have to go into your pocket to get a smartphone.  Now the information is not at hand, but on it. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/316/736/2f1/3167362f1f0a40418c321a9edf1e301a.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/c3f/bba/8f6/c3fbba8f67ba4edc8b83c9c450252a6f.jpg"><br><br>  Thongs that can be purchased for the SmartWatch 3 will help emphasize an individual style. Let's say a silicone version is suitable for a sports workout, and a massive bracelet or a leather strap is suitable for a business meeting. <br><br><h2>  Smartphone Case </h2><br>  Just buying a phone and removing a protective film from it, you want to keep its original appearance as long as possible.  After all, a scratched smartphone with a screen in the "web" may hint at the owner's sloppiness that not everyone will like it.  Covers come to the rescue. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/3db/d79/0eb/3dbd790eb0b74e03a703911d25d940a3.jpg"><br><br>  Sony produces many options for different models.  For example, <a href="http://www.sonymobile.com/ru/products/accessories/style-cover-touch-scr56/">Style Cover Touch</a> for Xperia X Performance allows you to fully work with your smartphone without opening the front cover.  There is also a <a href="http://www.sonymobile.com/ru/products/accessories/style-cover-flip-scr58/">Style Cover Flip</a> with a deaf front cover, a <a href="http://www.sonymobile.com/ru/products/accessories/style-cover-sbc30/">SBC30 carrying case</a> and a transparent <a href="https://www.sonymobile.com/ru/products/accessories/style-cover-sbc28/">SBC28</a> . <br><br><h2>  Protected headset </h2><br>  <a href="http://www.sonymobile.com/ru/products/accessories/stereo-bluetooth-headset-sbh70/">Sony SBH70</a> frees from wires that twist, cling to buttons, rivets, lightning and generally interfere in every way.  Those wires that are there are very short and do not hamper movement at all - they stretch only from ear to neck, where the main headset module is attached. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/7c2/b10/8ba/7c2b108ba8a547f7a8be7cbe53251791.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/906/0c7/da0/9060c7da06e249bf9407d0a848b07198.jpg"><br><br>  The device is firmly attached to the body and is resistant to water ingress (according to the standard IP57), which makes it an excellent option for jogging in the fresh air - a sudden downpour of SBH70 is not terrible.  In the music playback mode, the headset lasts six hours, and during conversations - 8.5.  As an alternative, you can consider the stereo headset <a href="http://www.sonymobile.com/ru/products/accessories/high-resolution-audio-headset-mdr-nc750/">MDR-NC750</a> . <br><br><h2>  Fitness bracelet </h2><br>  Wearable devices, in addition to the ability to report new notifications, have another extremely useful function - tracking your physical activity.  For people who play sports or simply monitor their health, this is almost an indispensable gadget that will definitely be useful. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/bde/ddf/f39/bdeddff39b5a41eda7f5f2641274067a.jpg"><br><br>  The <a href="https://www.sonymobile.com/ru/products/smart-products/smartband-talk-swr30/">SmartBand Talk</a> bracelet can count your steps, determines when you are running or sleeping, and then summarizes all the information and clearly shows the results.  The device can be taken with you everywhere: it can withstand diving to a depth of one and a half meters.  Also, the model performs the function of a headset. <br><br><h2>  Bluetooth keyboard </h2><br>  The main disadvantage of tablets - touch keyboard.  Whatever the developers invent, typing as fast as on a regular keyboard with physical buttons will fail.  You can forget about the ten-finger blind method immediately.  When mobility and ease of the device are important, and work is connected with writing texts, <a href="https://www.sonymobile.com/ru/products/accessories/bluetooth-keyboard-bkb50/">BKB50</a> comes to the <a href="https://www.sonymobile.com/ru/products/accessories/bluetooth-keyboard-bkb50/">rescue</a> . <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/800/b22/9b9/800b229b90d6483d965d457f46bdce56.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/79d/0ea/c4b/79d0eac4b9ce4de488c4a2ba333ffbad.jpg"><br><br>  The wireless keyboard connects via Bluetooth and actually turns the tablet into a laptop.  First, besides the tangible buttons, there is a touchpad.  And secondly, a ‚Äútablet‚Äù is inserted into a special slot, the design is held securely and does not fall apart from careless movement - it looks like a real laptop. <br><br><h2>  Smart alarm column BSP60 </h2><br>  At first it seems that this is a ball of fate - it looks very much like that.  But when turned on, the device becomes like a high-tech alarm clock: two raised body plates evoke associations with vintage alarms. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/1f7/2be/fc5/1f72befc5f5b4c028b8be8878b05976f.jpg"><br><br>  In addition to the simplest function ‚Äî triggering a signal at a specified time ‚Äî the <a href="http://www.sonymobile.com/ru/products/smart-products/smart-bluetooth-speaker-bsp60/">BSP60</a> can do a lot.  For example, on demand will tell about the weather, recall a to-do list and, of course, play songs from a smartphone.  The device will become not only a stylish decoration of your home or office, but also a valuable assistant. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/400391/">https://habr.com/ru/post/400391/</a></p>
