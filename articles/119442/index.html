      Startup owners needed to answer 3 questions: <br><ol><li>  Current site audience </li><li>  Monthly Income </li><li>  Plans </li></ol>  Also, each owner gave his comment: did the startup meet its expectations, what are its growth trends, etc. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h4>  1) <a href="http://docs.pravo.ru/">docs.pravo.ru</a> </h4><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/935/ba6/fdc/935ba6fdc07b3df5a35f172f6e0eff00.png" alt="image"><br><br>  <b>1) Attendance</b> <br>  Attendance 600 000 per month, registered users 160 000. Audience - lawyers and those who want to get acquainted with regulatory information.  Since other ATPs do not provide free access to documents and are not available to individuals due to high subscription fees. <br><br>  <b>2) Monthly income</b> <br>  Not yet monetized. <br><br>  <b>3) Plans</b> <br>  Leave all major regulatory legal acts free (federal laws and codes), break the ATP market by providing users with a product that meets web 2.0 requirements and user requirements. <br><br>  <b>4) Comment from you (did it meet expectations, what are the growth trends, etc.)</b> <br><blockquote>  ‚Äú <i>The project has already managed to find its fans, the system continues to evolve and improve.</i>  <i>During the year we did more than the main market players did not have time for 20 years.</i> <i><br></i>  <i>Today, more than 6000000 documents are available in the ATP Pravo.ru, 3,000 daily are added.</i> <i><br></i>  <i>The project is ambitious and is aimed primarily at creating a worthy alternative to the existing ATP.</i>  <i>It is their quality, the interface of the 90s and the terrible navigation that led us to create the ATP Pravo.ru</i> . ‚Äù </blockquote><br><br><h4>  2) <a href="http://roobex.ru/">roobex.ru</a> </h4><br>  Rubex is a service that allows you to find out unusual and interesting information about money.  What is the essence: you register banknotes and get the opportunity to follow their movement in the country. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/8a6/0f3/619/8a60f3619af43537340a8f05bf0e56e5.png" alt="image"><br><br>  <b>1) Attendance</b> <br>  Registered users a little more than 2 thousand.  Among them, 40% is weekly active.  April was closed for views in 20 thousand, and visitors a little more than 7 thousand. <br><br>  <b>2) Monthly income</b> <br>  It is absent altogether, since the monetization of the project at this stage is the loss of common sense, and the display of contextual advertising is not interesting in principle, since it annoys both us and our user. <br>  Now the site does not bring profit, but is an object of investment, the current maintenance and work cost around 40 - 50 thousand per month. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/330/ed7/08a/330ed708a1aa493498f25de98a59cf09.gif" alt="tumblr stats"><br><br>  <b>3) Plans</b> <br>  It is almost ready to release our applications for social networks vkontakte and facebook.  At this stage, beta versions are being tested.  Work is underway on the release of version 2.1 of the site, which will include a bunch of new and accumulated suggestions from users.  As soon as we‚Äôve finished with this, we‚Äôll go ahead with the project, we don‚Äôt spend our time or our money on it. <br><br>  <b>4) Comment from you (did it meet expectations, what are the growth trends, etc.)</b> <br><blockquote>  <i>‚ÄúHas the project met expectations?</i>  <i>Definitely - yes.</i>  <i>Beta version immediately after the release was recognized by the site of the day on Rambler, after the post our traffic lost our first server :) after the transfer came to MTV, then it became clear that we need to bring our site to ‚Äúmind‚Äù what we actually do at the moment. ‚Äù</i> </blockquote><br><br><h4>  3) <a href="http://surdoserver.ru/">surdoserver.ru</a> </h4><br>  The server is created to help deaf and hearing-impaired people and everyone in the online access to the resources of the Russian sign language and sign languages ‚Äã‚Äãof the world. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/10d/462/cc9/10d462cc98bc38d8c5c8c755f70e7908.png" alt="image"><br><br>  <b>1) Attendance</b> <br>  The main audience of our site are people with hearing impairments and people who want to learn Russian sign language.  It can be used by employees of social and other services in learning the language of the deaf, parents of deaf children. <br>  Recently, we found a link to the site in a message on the forum, where the site was recommended for learning sign language with the purpose of secret communication of students in the classroom and exams. <br><br>  <b>2) Monthly income</b> <br>  This project is based on the initiative of the laboratory of 17 IKU RAS.  Trapeznikova and is socially oriented, so making a profit is not a priority. <br><br>  <b>3) Plans</b> <br>  We are planning to create new services on the basis of the server of the remote server: Secondary Server 2 and Socio.Surdo. <br>  The Surdoser 2 is a web application that allows you to independently learn sign language from scratch without the help of any courses.  It is assumed the presence of a system of individual training course, which adapts to the user in the learning process.  Additionally, an application for mobile devices with the Android operating system will be created - the ‚Äúphrase book‚Äù of the sign language. <br>  Socio.Surdo is a social platform, the main goal of which will be the further development and unification of the Russian sign language.  Within the framework of the platform, systems for downloading video clips with gestures, their discussion, evaluation, making a joint decision on choosing the most appropriate gestures for new words will be available.  Integration with other popular social networks is planned, such as VKontakte, Twitter and Facebook. <br>  Also planned research in the field of gesture recognition using 3d-cameras (Xbox Kinect). <br><br>  <b>4) Comment from you (did it meet expectations, what are the growth trends, etc.)</b> <br><blockquote>  <i>‚ÄúPractice has shown that the‚Äú Surdoserver ‚Äùturned out to be an extremely popular and useful resource: the number of visitors is hundreds per day, and the geography of users goes beyond Russia, and this result was achieved without advertising and financial costs for promotion.</i> <i><br></i>  <i>Particular attention is expected to be given to the attractiveness of the project for a children's audience.</i>  <i>This is especially important because in our country there is an acute shortage of children's institutions for teaching and raising children with hearing impairment. ‚Äù</i> </blockquote><br><br><h4>  4) <a href="http://tulp.ru/">tulp.ru</a> </h4><br>  Tulp.ru is a specialized social network for ordinary people who use certain services and want to share this experience. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/b75/893/7ea/b758937eadd4f86c58c7b9d677912735.png" alt="image"><br><br>  <b>1) Attendance</b> <br>  About 400,000 visitors per month (according to Google Analytics). <br>  The increase in the number of visitors - an average of 30% per month (according to Google Analytics). <br>  About 9,700 accounts (data as of 05/05/2011; 2.4 times more since January 1, 2011). <br>  Over 30,000 establishments. <br>  About 50,000 reviews (2.3 times increase since January 1, 2011). <br><br>  <b>2) Monthly income</b> <br>  Found a smart investor who invested 3 million dollars in tulp.ru.  While tulp.ru does not bring income.  We plan to raise the issue of monetization in 2012. <br><br>  <b>3) Plans</b> <br>  We will create and sell various services for businesses.  For example, the ability to edit the profile of the institution, communicate directly with consumers, hold promotions, etc.  At the same time, we will not allow editing any reviews, deleting ‚Äúinconvenient‚Äù stories or photos, etc. for any money.  The question of the reputation and trust of users is a strategic one for tulp.ru. <br><br>  <b>4) Comment from you (did it meet expectations, what are the growth trends, etc.)</b> <br>  When we started working on tulp.ru last summer, we understood that this is a large-scale and very ambitious project that people need and at the same time. <br><br><blockquote>  <i>We came up with tulp.ru so that everyone could share their experience - and use the experience of others without fear of falling into the bait of hidden advertising.</i> <i><br><br></i>  <i>It would seem that the matter is small - to create an environment that would lead to the accumulation of national experience and to the exchange of it.</i>  <i>And this is the catch.</i>  <i>The fact is that attracting content consumers to the site is a fairly simple and straightforward task.</i>  <i>But how to motivate people to talk about their experiences?</i>  <i>How to guarantee people that they are protected from hidden advertising and other "gray" ways to promote products and services?</i>  <i>Finally, how and with what money to implement this entire complex system with a huge number of functions and nuances?</i> <i><br><br></i>  <i>Last summer, we began to act simultaneously in three directions: we organized and launched content collection using the prototype website, started designing a social network and started looking for an investor.</i> </blockquote><br><br><h4>  5) <a href="http://probkiizokna.ru/">probkiizokna.ru</a> </h4><br><br>  "Traffic jams from the window" develop a fixed network.  Any owner of a computer connected to the Internet, whose windows face the road, can download a special program from the site, install a webcam on the windowsill and take part in the project.  This program by video image of a webcam determines the road congestion in the surveillance zone and transmits this data along with the individual frames to the server. <br><br><img src="http://img812.imageshack.us/img812/3742/52362217.png" alt="image"><br><br>  <b>1) About the service</b> <br>  The project was launched in September 2010.  The own funds of the founders were used as sowing investments, and also a grant was received from the Foundation for Assistance to the Development of Small Enterprises in the Scientific and Technical Sphere (www.fasie.ru).  This is a state fund that provides free funding for promising innovative projects. <br><br>  Within 3 months after launch, the threshold of 80 cameras was crossed online.  After the first 3 months of operation, the project got into the investment pit, when the founders' funds ran out, and the necessary camera base - at least more than the market leader - was not recruited.  It took several months to find an investor.  For this period, the number of cameras online has decreased and stabilized at the level of 50-60.  Finally, in late April, an investor was found who provided funds for development. <br><br>  <b>2) Comment from you (did it meet expectations, what are the growth trends, etc.)</b> <br><blockquote>  <i>I found the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãusing ready-made infrastructure for building a network for collecting traffic data to be very attractive, ‚Äùsaid Maxim Gruzdev, the project‚Äôs author and project manager,‚Äú I worked in the markets of road facilities and video surveillance systems, so I have a good idea of ‚Äã‚Äãwhat it means to create a professional urban monitoring system consisting of at least 50 cameras.</i>  <i>Both technically and organizationally, this is a difficult task.</i>  <i>And, of course, it would be much more expensive, which would hardly make the project profitable.</i>  <i>Of course, since this is my first experience on the Internet, I underestimated the difficulty of attracting an audience.</i>  <i>It seemed that the growth of the project partners would be faster and easier.</i>  <i>Now we have worked on the bugs and are ready to continue work on expanding the webcam database.</i>  <i>Attracted investments should be enough to achieve our goal - 500 cameras online in 2011.</i> </blockquote><br><br><h4>  6) <a href="http://tarotaro.ru/">tarotaro.ru</a> </h4><br><br>  TaroTaro.ru is an affiliate program offering a unique service for ordering tarot layouts, as well as a new section for your site. <br><br><img src="http://img135.imageshack.us/img135/7131/81503013.png" alt="image"><br><br>  <b>1) Users</b> <br>  During operation, more than 150 partner sites have joined the system.  Among them are the largest resources on the Internet: the portal Rambler.Ru, <br>  Lady@Mail.ru, WomanJournal.Ru, as well as other popular women's and astrological sites. <br><br>  <b>2) Monthly income</b> <br>  Over the past 12 months, the project is self-sufficient, revenues amounted to $ 150,000, and the subscriber base is 450,000 people. <br><br>  <b>3) Plans</b> <br>  This year, TAROTARO plans to launch an astrological portal, an online store of magic products and an application for social networks. <br>  For these purposes, it is planned to attract $ 500,000 of external investments. <br><br>  <b>4) Comment from you (did it meet expectations, what are the growth trends, etc.)</b> <br><blockquote>  <i>The year of work on the project was difficult, but our team achieved the main thing - the viability of the model was demonstrated.</i>  <i>We are grateful to our partners who believed in our service and successfully promote it on their portals.</i>  <i>Now we are negotiating with investors to raise funds for the accelerated development of the project, according to current tasks.</i> </blockquote><br><br>  In turn, I would like to say that startups were not selected at all.  Those who sent the answers to the questions were published.  A total of 30-40 letters were sent. <br><br>  On the one hand, this is good - the reviewed startups either bring a good income, or at least are very useful and somehow unique.  But there are very few such startups.  During the search, more than half of start-ups a year ago were completely closed, and a substantial part of the rest was pretty much abandoned. <br><br>  Next time it is planned to consider ‚Äúdead startups‚Äù.  That is, those who did not succeed, the idea did not work, did not find an investor, etc. <br><br>  If you want potential clients or investors to know about your project, we can help you.  <a href="http://pr-hero.ru/">PR Hero</a> is a simple tool for performing complex tasks. <br><br>  Thanks for attention! </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/119442/">https://habr.com/ru/post/119442/</a></p>
