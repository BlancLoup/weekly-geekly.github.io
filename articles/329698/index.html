It‚Äôs about what YOU can do to get more skills, more job satisfaction and more attractiveness to world-class companies that you respect. <br><br>  At this session, we will not break away from reality and discuss concrete steps and ideas that you can implement immediately.  You will also hear real stories about testers and how they implemented these steps.  You will be able to choose some of the proposed ideas and start implementing them right today. <br><br>  This report is not about complaining, but about concrete actions that will help you become the best version of yourself. <br><br><hr><br><img align="left" width="180" src="https://habrastorage.org/web/453/9b1/78e/4539b178e52c4000b089c88cfd8cc697.jpg">  <b><a href="https://heisenbug-piter.ru/talks/improving-autotests-a-black-magic-performance//">11: 40-12: 30 Alexey Vinogradov - How to improve autotests: a session of black magic</a></b> <br><br>  You can write UI autotests in different ways.  Which techniques should be used by a professional developer, and which ones should be avoided?  Where is the pain in modern automated testing?  Alexey will demonstrate his position with illustrative examples.  Let's start with a simple code and apply popular design patterns to it consistently, such as: PageFactory, LoadableComponents, Single Responsibility Principle, and others. <br><br><hr><br><img align="left" width="180" src="https://habrastorage.org/web/d35/1db/0fa/d351db0fa024409a95c8192af427bfed.jpg">  <b><a href="https://heisenbug-piter.ru/talks/load-testing-a-web-service//">12: 50-13: 40 Alexey Lavrenyuk - Learning to analyze the results of load testing</a></b> <br><br>  We are shooting at the Python Tornado demo web service, which is specially written to show performance problems.  Alexey will show how resource leakage, heavy cron job, bad algorithms and heavy database queries appear in the load test reports.  We will draw conclusions, correct bottlenecks and compare the performance of the service "before" and "after." <br><br><hr><br><img align="left" width="180" src="https://habrastorage.org/web/798/8b7/26a/7988b726a2504f36b55b97d6f491a103.jpg">  <b><a href="https://heisenbug-piter.ru/talks/wash-your-hands-before-eating-or-sanitizer-in-testing//">14: 25-15: 15 Andrei Satarin - Wash your hands before eating, or Sanitizers in testing</a></b> <br><br>  As is known, ‚Äúwith great force comes great responsibility.‚Äù  C ++ is a language with great expressive power and enormous possibilities.  These features have to be paid for with potential defects that are not found in programs in managed languages. <br><br>  Sanitizers are great tools that allow you to find complex defects in C ++ programs.  Andrei will talk about these tools, their capabilities and how to use them for the benefit of your project. <br><br><hr><br><img align="left" width="180" src="https://habrastorage.org/web/c3b/8b8/4fc/c3b8b84fc9c94bc3b197469c2b6dbafb.jpeg">  <b><a href="https://heisenbug-piter.ru/talks/testing-in-data-world/">15: 35-16: 25 Igor Khrol - Testing in the data world</a></b> <br><br>  The management of the companies tries to make decisions not on a whim, but on the basis of numbers and objective data.  How to test the software that counts these numbers?  If the code, after processing the company's data for the year, shows 42% - is this the correct answer, or is there an error, and we should have received 43%?  Based on the practices developed by Toptal‚Äôs analytics department, I would like to answer these questions.  BI, ETL, DWH, ML ...

The more your project, the more reports you have to watch.  The world does not stand still, the release cycle is accelerating, some products have time to be released several times a week, and some several times a day. <br><br>  Allure Framework is a popular autotest report tool that simplifies their analysis.  In the report, Artem will tell about the new version of Allure 2. A lot of new things have appeared in it: environment, restarts and test history, display of fixtures, categories of errors and much more.  One of the key features is the ability to customize Allure for yourself using a plugin system. <br><br><hr><br><img align="left" width="180" src="https://habrastorage.org/web/9e1/8b7/e0a/9e18b7e0a58c4198b02944a0975c95e9.jpg">  <b><a href="https://heisenbug-piter.ru/talks/design-patterns-in-test-automation/">17: 50-18: 40 Nikolay Alimenkov - Design patterns in test automation</a></b> <br><br>  Design patterns are known in the design for many years.  Some developers love them, others consider it useless.  At the same time, design patterns have very clear objectives: to describe typical solutions for typical problems, create a common language for the community, improve understanding and reuse of existing approaches. <br><br>  Since test automation has its own set of tasks, there is also its own set of useful design patterns for this area.  In the report, Nikolai will go through all the known patterns and describe them in detail with several practical examples. <br><br><h2>  <b>Restrictions</b> </h2><br><ul><li>  Since the broadcast is free, it is <b>provided on the principle of as is</b> : we are sure that everything will be fine, but if that happens, do not blame me! </li><li>  <b>Video Records</b> .  They will be available almost immediately, but only for conference participants who have left feedback.  And for all the others, we traditionally post them in 3-4 months on Youtube. </li><li>  You cannot watch what happens <b>in other halls</b> .  And there will be <a href="https://heisenbug-piter.ru/">many interesting things</a> .  The next time you buy tickets and see everything without restrictions. </li></ul></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/329698/">https://habr.com/ru/post/329698/</a></p>
