No, this, of course, is not CeBIT and not even the exhibition center ... but for one single company - more than.  The World Trade Center was chosen as the venue - before that it was there only a couple of times - this building houses the offices of Logitech and Philips.

Beautiful slides (as far as required from the presentation), interactive, sound and light - all at the proper level.  Having estimated, I did not even remember something similar in my memory. <br><br>  There were several leading ones - from a beautiful girl and company representatives in Russia to the president of the CIS headquarters: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/520/aed/62c/520aed62ceadcb321c73e941ab33be26.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/e15/5fb/0e5/e155fb0e5ec1a5fb3848c3cc91ad1970.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/04f/6f3/475/04f6f347598ee40f4b57553f20e4c742.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/fae/771/a3c/fae771a3c5d99d9ad32eff8de748286f.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/80e/ae8/fac/80eae8fac8ec0502db81b67743643df3.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Everyone was telling something of his own, which I will briefly convey with one large pile of slides :) <br><br>  So, despite the crisis and just a hard time, Samsung has found the strength not only to keep afloat, but also to increase all sorts of indicators - growth, sales and production.  Not yet forgotten are the days when the Samsung was not the best "Chinese" fame, but after tens of years, the company really gave everyone the heat.  And, apparently, it is not going to rest on its laurels - at the very beginning of the presentation it was stated with confidence in its voice that by 2012 the company had set itself two big goals - to become a world leader and become a favorite consumer brand.  Well, we will watch with interest! <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/1c4/8e2/67e/1c48e267e5f61a7a7f13f5664cc179f8.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  The conquest of the world began with a story about developments in the field of household appliances.  Vacuum cleaners, air ionizers and air conditioners, refrigerators and electric stoves, microwaves and washing machines fell into this category - almost everywhere the company offered something new. <br><br>  Here, for example, a robo-vacuum cleaner, which could still be seen in the hall.  The idea is far from being new (such devices have been on sale for several years), but quite cool - a small smart cake travels across the floor and, in case of dirt, eats it with its rotating brushes.  Someone will say that this is all for lazy people, someone will declare that IT will not replace manual cleaning ... I‚Äôll say that I simply won‚Äôt pass it at home) Partitions between rooms, sneakers, children's toys - will definitely come up somewhere .  But in general, the idea is interesting. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/a9b/59d/457/a9b59d457a5f1d46b204f009cc6efdf5.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  There were no revolutions in refrigerators either, but there is progress.  For example, with the previous dimensions, thanks to a new method of insulation, the company managed to increase the net volume of some models by as much as 100 liters!  Doors continue to increase the functionality - from touch screens (photos, recording cases, calendars, something else there), ending with a solid interactive LED backlight - it looks very cool, but obviously not for communal and Khrushchev) <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/19f/a38/308/19fa38308789931f2f4fb082d99bb6f3.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  For washing machines have developed new forms of drums, eliminating the possibility of tissue damage;  as well as a new anti-vibration mechanism and a pre-foaming system - in order to effectively wash it was possible at a lower temperature and in a shorter time. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/216/d9a/c0c/216d9ac0c5a0d0bf5da6b662c94882c4.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Air conditioners did not become unbelievable - all the same units, but more efficient - both in terms of basic functionality and in terms of power consumption. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/0ac/8be/c77/0ac8bec77cdf352cabf51cd6bd4dd906.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  In general, having briefly run through new household developments, we slowly approached the most important, interesting. <br><br>  It's no secret that now a large emphasis is placed on a three-dimensional image of very many companies - I think, avalanche sales of such devices began after the cult Avatar.  And, while the people are still under the impression, everyone considered it their duty to do something so three-dimensional ‚Äî many analysts have been predicting a similar scenario for several years. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/a5d/ee9/c6a/a5dee9c6a8f29072c67ec00e5b20b2f6.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Actually, the Samsung decided to lead this direction and took a huge number of various solutions - from wireless glasses, to players and, in fact, by the TVs themselves. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/e94/e66/7f3/e94e667f36f4b2888e8a161f7b828dde.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/8f7/4cb/3d2/8f74cb3d2257ab1aa335a7169cfa4151.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/b6a/0dd/787/b6a0dd787f3660009961f6580feecf47.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/bc1/4d5/dfb/bc14d5dfb120b8a7e7f7db2d2832ce16.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/c52/04c/9ba/c5204c9ba1090f0fccc6308c3a7334a6.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/5f5/fef/8f2/5f5fef8f211a51b90f35a2e6d7408597.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  There were a lot of TV sets - several series, each with several models.  LCD, LCD, plasma, 3D HDTV - I think that after five minutes everyone was already confused in the classifications and just watched beautiful pictures. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/888/4f0/270/8884f0270b57eac5106fa09403696ef7.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/d66/3e9/080/d663e9080ad063e54c1e05c6e50b1435.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  In short, new technologies for color rendering (such as ‚Äúsmart‚Äù highlighting of certain screen areas), reducing energy consumption with the continued growth of the diagonal, and simply reducing the size (mainly thickness). <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/142/ff0/334/142ff03347ece8612f4b300c6ad5c39c.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  But by the way.  It seemed to me, or the company really pays too much attention to all sorts of improvements?  Perhaps some of them are really good + innovative.  But there are those who cause a lot of internal dialogue with himself.  For example, the Clear Motion Rate technology, which supposedly improves the picture quality 16 times, and in real time - during the presentation such things are usually supported by beautiful pictures. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/5d4/d25/6fa/5d4d256fa1571f3e319c048fce72ea29.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  But think for yourself ... where to get additional detail in this size?  Photoshop and the most powerful graphic solutions sometimes allow to achieve results that are noticeably different from the original (in color, clarity, etc.), but I do not believe that it makes the TV (even if it is three times expensive and three times smart).  Moreover, there is still an edge on the issue of the content itself - if you can still argue over HD video, then there is definitely no conventional television.  so, will someone persuade me or is it all the same marketing?  ) <br><br>  Well, perhaps the most insulting thing is that at such events there is practically no time for a detailed study of this or that product - you won‚Äôt climb the hundreds of TV sets, compare pictures, features, etc.  But in any case, the work does not stand still and it is very nice. <br><br>  Speaking of the 3D image, absolutely all manufacturers draw a screen image in the projection from which the moving object flies out (the top is headed by a dolphin or a killer whale, followed by a football player, a car and all sorts of butterfly birds).  Actually, Samsung was no exception ... although I didn‚Äôt see how many three-dimensional screens, I never got out of the screen.  Although, a pleasant exception can be considered these girls in a small commercial break.  Fap Fap ) <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/cdf/620/334/cdf6203345da21baa787be8238f58fb8.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/df3/dae/7c1/df3dae7c17fcfbda61a11d0c8df2386b.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/566/e38/fde/566e38fde1e3fdc9b56ea4cdb589c742.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  After the girls began to talk about mobile devices - phones and communicators, cameras, netbooks, laptops and all sorts of electronic books. <br><br>  The most interesting for many was the new <b>Samsung Wave</b> communicator on its own platform - <b>Samsung Bada</b> .  The most obvious advantage is the large Super-AMOLED screen, behind which there is a serious hardware stuffing - all the same gigahertz (as on my HTC HD2, which is almost half a year).  How well the sales of the new device will go - time will tell, but for now we can definitely say that the new operating system will have to be oooooooooooooooooooooooochen not easy. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/b21/080/e2c/b21080e2c72da4922b1068ca36b00070.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/36c/70c/e17/36c70ce171267b0bc51ddd72efb571d4.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/60c/bf3/7f8/60cbf37f8a55c1855ba91133bbc52567.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  In the photo niche, too, it was decided to succeed - looking at the general fashion on the "mirrorless DSLRs", several devices were released, one of which is the <b>Samsung NX10</b> . <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/5d5/636/76d/5d563676d399887cfe4462d4c53fa580.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  The second innovation was the <b>Samsung EX1</b> - a more compact version, but with an even more expressive taste of the "watering can") The camera is very similar to my <b>Lumix GF1</b> , a review of which I will try to finish soon. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/4ff/cd9/110/4ffcd911049fca77a3f2c677be8e7d71.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/456/464/cc7/456464cc7ade183112055778939935a0.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Well, in other areas of the periphery, it was decided to succeed - printers, e-books, and many, many laptops. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/255/430/32c/25543032ca7efa076564634983adc1da.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/cbb/81a/2be/cbb81a2be27da33b405cc8b0e3a86036.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/21d/a6c/b75/21da6cb75ef155b6b68ab31b0990c17d.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/fe5/29b/111/fe529b11125aba5e05657cd66f3e0e3c.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/a35/196/0f7/a351960f71e3a32a2c62dbfb3cbf6881.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/591/412/c65/591412c65013704fff95856bd2b91cd2.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  On this solemn note, the presentation ended and everyone was invited to go to a large demo room, where it was possible to meet all of the above live! <br><br>  At the entrance was a large rectangular column of three-dimensional panels - all visitors were given three-dimensional glasses and you could see what all this is for 3D. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/c17/916/85b/c1791685b3fbdf1d10f82cd3e6d77ccc.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/1b3/664/c79/1b3664c793d33a9e2202d6a90a378dac.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Wireless glasses are very similar to those offered by NVidia (I‚Äôm talking about 3D Vision).  Sit comfortably, but ... from the image of 9 screens from a distance of a couple of meters it was somehow uncomfortable ... but from a distance, yes, everything is fine. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/b98/b90/f9a/b98b90f9a4f6252dea7de7325936bd6e.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/36f/9a3/666/36f9a366692501038b444e9673988f77.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  To the left of the entrance was all "bytovuha." <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/dc0/917/757/dc0917757b14aac4dd9cdcefbc27e831.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/9d1/6c3/bfe/9d16c3bfe91ec339f5ce8eccc68ba298.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/e09/a4a/6ee/e09a4a6ee579c9c5d28351858f743f1c.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Refrigerators were pleasantly surprised by the fact that there were real products inside, not soulless plastic dummies) Juices, beer, fish - mmm. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/comment_images/bb3/9e6/4cf/bb39e64cff91a9732dd1f5425c305853.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  On the right there is a whole wall of TVs (there were SO MUCH that at one moment it seemed that for the sake of completeness, several telephones were taken from other producers))). <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/cdf/0a0/dee/cdf0a0dee0048b5f7130b6addd308356.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/d98/c7c/a04/d98c7ca04ae0c50927d07a5edd80a162.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Most of all I was surprised by the TV, which in the presentation was compared with a pencil (there is no real photo).  It is clear that this is a piece of marketing, that the thickness is only in the thinnest place ... but on the whole the TV is unrealistically cool !!!  Something about 55 inches stunning screen, chained in a stylish metal frame - a sort of baking sheet.  Extremely stylish, but the price does not even want to think) <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/b50/b92/632/b50b92632c7f7d4748cda04e83b6fb26.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Already wrote that some companies have offered to use Skype through the TV - on Habr√© they <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/skype/80028/">wrote</a> about it more than once.  Then I did not deny myself the pleasure of <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/skype/80028/">peeking</a> over the webcam reality ... but if everything is as in the photo below, then I am calm. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/3e5/104/cc5/3e5104cc5a168b4459d7b19cccb84f75.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Several monitors were presented, with an allegedly 100% sRGB coverage.  The 6-monitor screen also met - finally I personally managed to see what it was.  Absolutely not for the home, but you can find useful application almost everywhere.  About the <a href="http://trendclub.ru/blogs/chat/3939">evil joke</a> with this screen :) <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/f9c/2be/b33/f9c2beb33046882c8ad1e9dc52a0b46e.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Habr is still to impose and impose) But there are rumors that on the five-monitor system in the lower right corner of the screen on Habr at exactly at midnight an image of Lenin appears. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/048/dc7/4de/048dc74de9defb8c8d97988ef3559ce4.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  On the interactive whiteboard, everyone considered to be properly photographed with the name of their publication. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/c3a/1fc/d16/c3a1fcd16fdc433f35947fc39d6aa8cd.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  It was shown several models of electronic books, including touch.  Very interesting, but like everywhere, to say something specific is possible only after a closer acquaintance. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/347/7e4/f6b/3477e4f6b971a6b471cf28e2c2457c12.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/772/9cd/e54/7729cde54eb572995a1f550d9b45dadd.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/comment_images/4b8/38e/799/4b838e799dc62668547a4c92b6db43fb.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Well and, actually, mobile phones - the same Wave, the same Monte, the same Spica) SuperAMOLED-screen in reality looks really very cool!  Unfortunately, in the photo, as always, it was not transmitted. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/84f/97a/a6a/84f97aa6a13ff294c59f8803a9af8948.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/1a6/a51/8db/1a6a518db6112b4c19d7dab63e029830.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/5a0/e08/30d/5a0e0830d982d7f39c266de4b200464b.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Notice how cool the shadow is under the phone. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/ee0/eff/968/ee0eff96831f52cd0acde0dcf37fa9d5.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/cc6/254/df6/cc6254df6c838ece9d64c9db595b67a7.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/5be/c4c/70f/5bec4c70fe2fdee6cb185a2eec64d62c.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Platform, by the way - android :) <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/4a3/79c/7de/4a379c7de43712ee0fd96feb3704b805.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/255/e4b/a9a/255e4ba9aa796a728d9108d0b1998508.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  In general, so much of everything was presented that for lovers of technology it was just a balm for the soul) But, again, it is a pity that everything had to be seen only very superficially.  After that, there were parallel two round tables - about 3DTV and about mobile devices, which I, unfortunately, didn‚Äôt get because of the pleasant company :) Yes, and the camera by that time sat down treacherously.  But maybe this is for the better - there are already 75 photos in the post.  I hope to read about the missing on other sites. <br><br>  As I said, the company has set a goal to become the favorite company of millions of people by 2012.  Apparently, they decided to start small and right at the conference - at the exit you could change your badge for an 8-inch digital photo frame, which can be used as a second monitor.  Thank you, I was inspired :) <br><br>  I have seen quite a few acquaintances - I counted people only with Habra 5) It was really very interesting - such events are held not every day and not every large company.  By the way, not so long ago I was doing a similar post - " <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/asus/blog/85770/"><b>What ASUS is preparing for us</b></a> ." <br><br>  Once again I am convinced - we live in an interesting time! <br>  <b>Successes!</b> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/88216/">https://habr.com/ru/post/88216/</a></p>
