    <h2>  Before that </h2><br>  The decision matured for quite some time.  As an IT specialist since childhood, I have always been interested in technologies that almost always came from the West.  From the mythical west, which in my childhood (1980s) did not deify only the lazy (‚ÄúImagine, they have 26 varieties of kefir in the store!‚Äù, And the word ‚Äúyogurt‚Äù was not in the lexicon at that time).  From the inaccessible West, which I saw only in photographs in magazines (I could look at the skyline of New York literally for hours). <br><br>  Then there was a study (like in Zhvanetsky: ‚ÄúI carried this feeling through the war, through an even more difficult peacetime‚Äù), a family appeared, and in 2003 I had the opportunity to visit Germany.  I keenly remembered the feeling of peace and freedom.  They said to me: ‚ÄúYou know, we have a crisis now,‚Äù and I looked and thought: ‚ÄúWe would have such a crisis!‚Äù <br><br>  Since then, the desire to fall down (although for a while) has been registered in me. <br><br>  Well, and there is a job for a catcher (is it true, do thoughts materialize?).  After a certain amount of time, an acquaintance of an acquaintance, a familiar acquaintance, dropped out that their company in Holland was recruiting employees.  The field of activity is business intelligence. <br><br>  By that time, I had considerable experience working with databases and data warehouses in particular, I was a project manager at a small but very proud IT company.  What I am modest and said in my resume. <br><br>  I got interested in, called home for a preliminary interview (I was worried and stupid terribly, but I didn‚Äôt hit the face in the dirt).  According to the results of this, an interview was appointed in Moscow - the CEO himself came for recruiting.  Then, after some time, they sent me an offer, which I could not refuse. <br><br>  There were a number of problems - for example, I had a loan on me, and I also needed to get a new passport (I don‚Äôt know what was simpler yet) - but they were all resolved and last April I set foot on the ground of tulips and marijuana without any impurities ( however, at that time it was still possible to add tobacco to it). <br><br><h2>  There </h2><br>  Then there was, as usual, a culture shock.  Vile feeling of dumbness, familiar, probably, to everyone who has been abroad.  A bunch of problems and fears of "doing something wrong." <br><br>  Yes, it was also my first experience of self-driving, without an instructor.  They gave me the keys and showed me the window - in-he stands.  Oh, and I suffered a lot of fear ... <br><br>  Then there was the fight against bureaucracy, so that I was allowed to bring my family.  It should be noted here that the struggle here is of a slightly different plan than in Russia.  There is no need to be rude to anyone, threaten, grease.  Just the procedure of registration, by virtue of its rarity, was not familiar to the girl who made out me in the municipality. <br><br>  Anyway, everything was decided.  For my wife, by the way, this was generally the first experience of being abroad. <br><br><h2>  About motives </h2><br>  All people are different.  I propose to slaughter it on the nose to all those who love to rape someone else's mindset.  I am writing here exclusively <b>about my experience</b> . <br><br>  Up to 25 years, I thought that "my purpose here."  This is my country, my homeland, here is my future.  Who if not us?  Weaklings are leaving!  Losers! <br><br>  Then, somewhere around 30, and especially after what I saw in the abroad, I became much more pragmatic. <br><br>  I decided.  I do not want to bring the lives of my children to the altar of the Russian bureaucracy.  I do not want to live in a country where prison songs are played on the central radio.  I do not want to feed the unscrupulous government who buys the next palace, while my mother, who has undergone evacuation, receives a pension of about 80 euros.  I am not going to raise and raise cannon fodder for the next Chechnya (yes, human life on one-sixth of Nichrome is not worth it. Especially ordinary life).  I do not intend to be afraid of "power" cops. <br><br>  Especially acutely, I realized that I was right, already living here. <br><br>  People of the West are free in true inner understanding.  This is evident from the way they greet, move, talk.  I don‚Äôt know how in other countries, but here no one pushes a pensioner who has blocked the way to a trolley in a store - they will wait in silence, at least smiling, greet them. <br><br>  Please interpret my words correctly: I do not idealize the locals.  Scum is everywhere;  besides, politeness is often ostentatious.  But these people are educated, but I myself - with my not very bad upbringing - at first, I felt just like a savage. <br><br>  I like local socialism.  There are almost no insanely rich people, but there are no very poor ones either.  Homeless and even stray dogs, I have not met even once.  <i>While</i> it is pleasant. <br><br><h2>  What is it for? </h2><br>  Why do I even write all this?  I would sit myself and be quietly happy, you have happiness now! <br><br>  I have a faint hope that such articles can change anything.  It's pretty stupid, but still ... We (you) won the President of the Internet reads - well, how come across the blog "It's time to blame!" :) <br><br>  By the way: I am madly in love with Russian culture, in particular, literature.  And it scares me terribly when people who call themselves patriots cannot coherently write three words. <br><br>  That's all.  All those interested in the details of Dutch life, I invite you to proceed to <a href="http://yktoo.com/ru/blog">my blog</a> . <br><br>  Upd.  Temporarily transferred to a personal blog.  "It's time to dump!" Very much closed. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/59678/">https://habr.com/ru/post/59678/</a></p>
