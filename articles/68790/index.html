What we have not seen spam?  We saw, but this time the scammers do not offer anything to lengthen, buy, sell, but advertise an interesting service.  The text is always the same. <br><blockquote>  <em>Hello.</em>  <em>Welcome to the SearchGSM website.</em>  <em>With the help of it, it is possible to find out the location of the person you are interested in by his mobile phone number in a few minutes.</em>  <em>Who may need it?</em>  <em>We will not go deep into this question.</em>  <em>Everyone has their own reasons.</em>  <em>Someone wants to check the whereabouts of a boy or girl, someone to find their child.</em>  <em>Practically, it is possible to find out the location of almost every person, indicating only his cell number.</em>  <em>For this reason, we must warn that our service is created for informational purposes only, we are not responsible for misuse, results and any possible consequences.</em> <br><br>  <em>The technique used in the GSM-locator is well developed.</em>  <em>It was created in the USA in the era of the ‚Äúcold war‚Äù with the USSR.</em>  <em>And just recently ...</em> <br><br>  <em>Thanks to new technologies, and the huge spread of the Internet, it has become possible that which has recently been fiction.</em>  <em>Our company, SearchGSM is rightfully one of the most famous providers of this type of service.</em>  <em>Therefore, if you need to urgently find out the whereabouts of ANY person with a known mobile phone number, use our service.</em> </blockquote><br>  The link itself is different each time, but the redirect leads to <a href="http://search-gsm.ru/">search-gsm.ru</a> .  The site says the following. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><blockquote>  <em>Service for searching and tracking mobile phones using the GSM standard system (global mobile communication system) through the GPS-TRACKER satellite network.</em>  <em>The system monitors the mobile phones of cellular operators around the world using GSM and GPS technology.</em> </blockquote><br>  Even some satellite data lead.

      An inexperienced curious user will ask "how is that?" And decide to check, especially since the service costs only 9 rubles per day.  Who is sorry for 9 rubles? <br><br>  But before we reap somewhere, we look at the very bottom of the <a href="http://search-gsm.ru/%3Fmod%3Drules">page</a> in small print with the link to the <a href="http://search-gsm.ru/%3Fmod%3Drules">User Agreement</a> .  Aha  What we have here. <br><blockquote>  <em>...</em> <em>2 Description of Services</em> <br><br>  <em>Search-GSM.ru services are provided to Users who have access to the Internet and installed software for working with the web interface located only at <a href="http://search-gsm.ru/">Search-GSM.ru</a> , on the basis of the User Agreement.</em>  <em><strong>Search-GSM.ru is a comic gaming service that provides the user with access to a Flash-game for a fee.</strong></em>  <em><strong>Search-GSM.ru provides the User with access to the Flash part of the game after the User makes a payment by sending sms to a short number.</strong></em> <br><br>  <em>3. Entry into force of the User Agreement</em> <br><br>  <strong><em>The user agreement comes into force from the moment of putting a tick in front of the text ‚ÄúI have read the rules (a)‚Äù on ‚ÄúSearch-GSM.ru‚Äù.</em></strong>  <strong><em>User Registration includes his acceptance of the User Agreement.</em></strong>  <strong><em>Finding and using the services of ‚ÄúSearch-GSM.ru‚Äù means that you are familiar with and agree to the User Agreement, even without having passed the registration stage.</em></strong> <br><br>  <em>4. Obligations and responsibility of the User</em> <br><br>  <em><strong>After registration, the User receives a code to access the personal section with the game.</strong></em>  <em><strong>Search-GSM.ru has the right to prevent the use of certain passwords or delete them without prior notice.</strong></em>  <em>The user is responsible for the security of his password, for all information published publicly using the services of ‚ÄúSearch-GSM.ru‚Äù, including the comments left on ‚ÄúSearch-GSM.ru‚Äù.</em>  <em>The user is solely responsible for all materials published by him using the services of ‚ÄúSearch-GSM.ru‚Äù.</em> <br><br>  <em>5. Payment for services</em> <br><br>  <em>...</em> <em><br></em>  <em><strong>One SMS message pays for access to the service for 30 days.</strong></em> <br><br>  <em>6. Warranty Exemption</em> <br><br>  <em><strong>User understands and agrees that:</strong></em> <em><strong><br></strong></em>  <em><strong>a.</strong></em>  <em><strong>The user uses the gaming service Search-GSM.ru at his own risk.</strong></em>  <em>Search-GSM.ru services are provided ‚Äúas is‚Äù.</em>  <em>Search-GSM.ru does not assume any responsibility, including for the compliance of the result of the search query with the purpose of the User;</em> <em><br></em>  <em><strong>b.</strong></em>  <em><strong>Search-GSM.ru is a game that has the character of a rally.</strong></em>  <em><strong>All information presented on the website is fictional, so the game Search-GSM.ru can not be taken seriously.</strong></em> <em><br></em>  <em>c.</em>  <em>Search-GSM.ru does not guarantee that: the services of Search-GSM.ru will meet the requirements of the User;</em>  <em>the results that can be obtained from Search-GSM.ru will be accurate and reliable;</em>  <em>the quality of the services of Search-GSM.ru will meet the expectations of the User;</em>  <em>all software errors in the website Search-GSM.ru will be fixed;</em> <em><br></em>  <em><strong>d.</strong></em>  <em><strong>Search-GSM.ru does not return the money spent by the user;</strong></em> <em><br></em>  <em>e.</em>  <em>Search-GSM.ru is not responsible for any losses, including direct, special, unforeseen or consecutive losses, lost profits and other risks, even if Search-GSM.ru warned of the possibility of such losses.</em>  <em>Thus, the User assumes all risks associated with the use of the Search-GSM.ru service.</em> </blockquote><br>  The stump is clear that no one ever reads any user agreements.  In the meantime, it says that the user presses the agreement with the agreement that the payment goes immediately for 30 days (270 rubles), and finally, that the whole service is a joke.  Funny guys disown all claims. <br><blockquote>  How????  You did not know what a joke is this game?  The agreement is written !!!  As where???  There, in small print below. </blockquote><br>  Here is such a SCAM, gentlemen.  What will not come up with the Internet fraudsters.  And I post his post ParA.  After all, negative advertising is also advertising. <br><br>  <b>UPDATE.</b> <br>  Just wrote, as they climbed and in LJ. <br>  They suggested that google about scam sites need to be reported <a href="http%253A%252F%252Fsearch-gsm.ru%252F">here</a> .  (via <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/users/pozitron/" class="user_link">PoZitron</a> ) <br>  How it looks can be viewed <a href="http://search-gsm.ru/game.html">on the link</a> completely free and safe.
