Actually, companies from Russia were simply forced to migrate to Russian providers, because in many cases it is absolutely impossible to work without access to the ‚Äúclouds‚Äù. <br><br>  The most popular, of course, are services from Amazon, Microsoft and Google - if only because of its relatively low cost.  Both large and small companies work with such services.  "Clouds" are good because they allow to scale the business without the need to create your own network infrastructure.  This means the possibility of significant savings.  But after the foreign "clouds" began to fail as a result of Roskomnadzor, we had to look for an alternative. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Domestic companies realized that to base their business only on the decision of one company is rather dangerous.  Some organizations began to use several services of different companies at once, and most often domestic solutions are used as a reserve, <a href="https://www.vedomosti.ru/technology/articles/2018/09/06/780063-rossiiskie-oblachnie-servisi">as reported</a> by Vedomosti.

      Understanding the prospects of the current situation, Russian telecommunications companies began to offer new opportunities.  For example, as early as April of this year, VimpelCom launched a service for leasing computing power, which was called Beecloud.  The company began to provide paid services from the beginning of summer.  Of the 170 customers who tested the service, 20 were transferred to a commercial basis. In August, revenue from cloud services rose to 800 thousand rubles. <br><br>  As for other companies, MTS has increased the number of cloud solution users from May to August by 40%.  MegaFon has about the same situation. <br><br>  Mail.ru Group also faced customer growth at Mail.ru Cloud Solutions.  Some customers transferred the websites to the new platform in just a few hours, which they had to do to restore their operation after the Roskomnadzor blocked the pool of addresses belonging to foreign services.  According to representatives of Mail.ru, the growth of the cloud business since the beginning of 2018 amounted to several tens of percent, and the size of the average check increased by 40-60%. <br><br>  According to some experts, the demand for Russian cloud services is growing not only because of the blockages, but also because the prices of Russian companies are not too high.  And working with local solutions is more convenient - not in all cases, but often enough. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/422727/">https://habr.com/ru/post/422727/</a></p>
