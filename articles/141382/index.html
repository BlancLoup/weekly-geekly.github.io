Medvedev, whom we all may remember as the first president of Russia, actively using gadgets, the Internet and social networks. <br><br>  You may have heard that Medvedev has <a href="http://twitter.com/medvedevrussia">Twitter</a> , <a href="http://vk.com/dm">VKontakte</a> and <a href="https://www.facebook.com/Dmitry.Medvedev">Facebook</a> accounts.  Maybe you yourself subscribed to Medvedev in some social network.  Although not sure.

      Recently, I asked friends if they follow Medvedev on Twitter?  Of the 10 people responded positively only two.  According to <a href="http://blogs.yandex.ru/top/twitter/">Yandex</a> Twitter more than 3 million users.  If more than a million people read the <a href="http://twitter.com/medvedevrussia">@medvedevrussia</a> account, then it turns out that every third Twitter user in Russia reads Medvedev. <br><br>  Who are these people?! <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/dac/444/c35/dac444c352a761871f189008f9f78d7a.jpg"><br><br>  I will try to answer this question below.  Carefully, under the cut a lot of graphics and text. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h2>  Twitter </h2><br>  June 23, 2010 Medvedev started a Twitter account.  On May 7, he had 1,183,698 followers. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/a8c/5bb/ee7/a8c5bbee70baad703403b2eff2784d37.png"><br>  @MedvedevRussia has a little more than 40 thousand protected accounts and a total of 201 suspended. <br><br><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/b07/d15/936/b07d15936a2316d4c2f116b28deaefa1.png"><br>  29.6% of accounts have 0 followers, and 1-10 followers have 48% Twitter accounts.  It turns out that accounts with more than 10 followers are only 22.4%. <br><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/8bf/0b5/4c2/8bf0b54c28d282477f187fd93116aa4b.png"><br>  Dmitry Anatolyevich is read by 49201 people.  They are very similar to mass followers with more than 1000 friends of 14694 people.  Those which I would very conditionally call ‚Äúnewbies‚Äù with less than 100 friends make up 91%, and regular users - from 100 to 1000 friends - 7.8% <br><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/32a/b22/1ec/32ab221ec70e2c762a07b13c8a46f2d1.png"><br>  More than 455 thousand did not write to Twitter a single tweet.  Only about 45 thousand people have 1000 tweets.  This sample does not include protected and suspended accounts. <br><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/227/f59/7bf/227f597bfa666d432b29a8dcf4e074a6.png"><br>  Data was taken from 694,735 people who have more than 0 tweets and their account is not protected or suspended. <br>  44% of accounts have not been tweeted for a month already; you can add 29.6% of accounts with 0 tweets to them, it‚Äôs not a small number of those who don‚Äôt write to twitter at all. <br>  29.6% of tweeters wrote at least 1 tweet for this week. <br><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/912/af0/070/912af007072b6c27257ffaa192ed5302.png"><br>  An interesting in all respects service <a href="http://klout.com/">klout.com</a> , tells us that the entire audience of Medvedev‚Äôs million account is 67,000 people. <br><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/3fc/8b3/bbe/3fc8b3bbe00df5e6ca655ed532c7d5e6.png"><br>  The number of users added to favorites is a very interesting parameter.  Conduct an experiment: go to your favs <a href="http://twitter.com/favorites">twitter.com/fainted</a> and try to count.  I can make the assumption that you have more than 1 tweet added to your favorites, although 80% of followers have none. <br><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/ec6/6d4/0ed/ec66d40eddcc4cb3d335f621db11e862.png"><br>  Sheets are usually used by advanced users who understand why they are needed, among the followers of @medvedevrussia, such 12%.  Although, an ordinary user can easily do without them. <br><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/20f/d70/136/20fd7013687889fccb1fbafe6b3f3895.png"><br>  44% have default avatars. <br><br><br>  I used the <a href="http://twittercounter.com/">http://twittercounter.com/</a> service to collect statistics on followers. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/f8e/164/f54/f8e164f543a924376357be33af3de293.png"><br>  Screenshot taken February 22.  Googling, I still did not understand what the magic date was at the end of August, that 300,000 followers were added to the account so abruptly. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/3a2/39b/b9c/3a239bb9ccd3b2fa96a19a38e084377a.jpeg"><br>  Screenshot taken May 11th. <br><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/daa/066/545/daa06654516dc4957048d19595ea5efb.png"><br>  Although the data from <a href="http://twirate.ru/">http://twirate.ru/</a> show that in reality there was no surge. <br><br><h2>  In contact with </h2><br>  <a href="http://vk.com/dm">The account</a> exists from November 9, 2011, during which time 1 501 505 people have subscribed to it. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/1da/32e/e0a/1da32ee0a9bf97a5d798e676f8deae2e.png"><br>  Nearly 160,000 deactivated accounts. <br>  Deactivated accounts are those that, according to the social network, are suspiciously active, for example, like <a href="http://vk.com/id313458">Dmitry Medvedev</a> .  As far as I understand, when the account recovery period passes, the starnitsa is deleted and becomes of <a href="http://vk.com/id148043806">this kind</a> . <br><br><br>  If you look at the first subscribers of Dmitry Anatolyevich, you can see the following picture: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/2e8/0d3/c9a/2e80d3c9a221a7adfc19e7bebd3b2242.png"><br>  I wonder why if you rewind about the middle, the picture will change dramatically? <br><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/0ce/1bc/fbc/0ce1bcfbcf334b264aee42b46773f7ba.png"><br>  62% men, 38% women.  I honestly thought it would be the opposite. <br><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/fdb/665/e38/fdb665e38dbd8d4df1d207ae554bb1b3.png"><br>  600 thousand people have a year of birth.  65% of people indicated that they are between 12 and 21 years old.  10 people under 12 years old. <br><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/88c/38c/974/88c38c974325f007b275a8a980580233.png"><br>  Data from VK application <a href="http://followers_app/">http://vk.com/followers_app</a> <br><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/650/bb0/9b4/650bb09b48c1b8fec28314cff96a3eaa.png"><br>  14 thousand people have no friends, and 35 thousand more than a thousand.  Otherwise, everything is usually, in people from 100 to 500 people in the bulk. <br><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/eb7/9c2/fc9/eb79c2fc972c71e0d67a34b89ed4d304.png"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/066/ba4/ca4/066ba4ca49ec9c6ec326dfc088ed3e66.png"><br>  Dmitry Anatolyevich's subscribers very much like to add audio and video to themselves :) <br><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/940/0da/dbc/9400dadbc1d16a2608e59dbba65bce73.png"><br>  Well, probably the most interesting graph showing the activity of users, based on the parameter of the last call to your account.  880 thousand people were active in VK at least once a day.  Only 130 thousand did not enter more than a month. <br><br><h2>  Facebook </h2><br>  Medvedev started a <a href="https://www.facebook.com/Dmitry.Medvedev">Facebook page</a> on October 20, 2011. <br>  Unfortunately, I did not find a way to view all subscribers through the API, so I have to be content with the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/Dmitry.Medvedev/likes">statistics</a> that the social network itself represents. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/650/c61/1ea/650c611eaa4ef55f994658e4c0d79dae.png"><br>  It is not difficult to calculate that only 2.3% of the people who liked the page participate somehow in the discussion of the content on the page. <br><br><br><h2>  As i thought </h2> <br>  The grabber script is written in ruby, using <a href="https://github.com/jnunemaker/twitter">this gem</a> to get data from Twitter.  In order for the script to work for a reasonable time, I had to open my old <a href="http://twitter.com/first_follower">@first_follower</a> account, I had Twitter posted it to the White List at one time, so I can make not 300 requests, but 10,000 per hour. <br><br>  With VKontakte everything is more complicated.  Unfortunately, I did not find any acceptable gem for the vkontakte API, so I worked <a href="http://vk.com/developers.php%3Foid%3D-1%26p%3D%25D0%259E%25D0%25BF%25D0%25B8%25D1%2581%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B5_%25D0%25BC%25D0%25B5%25D1%2582%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B4%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B2_API">directly</a> through the request API query. <br><br>  Graphs built in Excel.  I took the little people from the service for creating infographics: <a href="http://infogr.am/">http://infogr.am/</a> , it‚Äôs a pity the service is still very, very raw, although the idea is good. <br><br><h2>  Data </h2><br>  I understand perfectly well that with the data that I collected you can build many more interesting things and dependencies, I am always happy with new ideas.  Still, there may be those who say that I strongly ‚Äúembellish‚Äù the situation.  For you <a href="https://disk.yandex.net/disk/public/%3Fhash%3Dc2HLsKVREVNFe44wo0CdednAW0PNv69p7xPy8ngfawk%253D">csv files</a> with all the data.  I decided to try the yandex disk, since a certain group of comrades praises him so much. <br><br>  Yes, I have been thinking for a long time whether it is right to post data with user IDs.  I decided that because  The social networks themselves on Twitter and VKontakte allow you to see all the subscribers inside the web interface, which means there can be no mystery in this. <br><br><h2>  What for? </h2><br>  It was interesting for me to look at real numbers, which audience reads a famous person in the social network.  According to the figures that the social network itself offers to watch, it is completely unclear who all these thousands of people are, how active they are, how ‚Äúalive‚Äù they are.  According to the plans, to conduct another 1 analysis to determine whether all indicators of reader activity are the same within the social network. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/141382/">https://habr.com/ru/post/141382/</a></p>
