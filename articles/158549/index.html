  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Pen mouse</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/2a7/773/558/2a7773558b322118ac61e1edfbab6115.jpg" align="left">  I present a review of an unusual gadget that recently came into my hands.  It is a wireless optical mouse, made in the form of a pen.  The device is probably intended for drawing.  More comfortable than a mouse <br>  The device is bought on ebay at a price of just over 10 dollars. <br><br><h4>  Design </h4><br>  The device is made of several plastic parts of average quality.  However, it lies well in the hand and minor flaws in the fit are visible only upon careful examination.  The handle is equipped with three mouse buttons and a wheel.  I must say that the location of the controls is chosen quite successfully, the fingers themselves get to the right place. <a name="habracut"></a>  The index - ‚Äúleft mouse button‚Äù, ‚Äúright‚Äù under the thumb, the third - above the wheel (a dubious decision). <br>  The device has an optical sensor with backlight red diode.  Permission is not specified, but is expected to be low.  Probably like the cheapest mice.  Available in several different colors to choose from. <br>  A significant drawback was that the device worked only with the open cap of the battery compartment.  The problem was that the Duracell battery purchased for it has a rather sharp end profile from the plus side and loses contact with the spring when the cap is closed.  However, this problem was easily solved by a ‚Äúfile‚Äù - a little bit cut the plastic with the sharp edge of the scissors. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/aa9/d98/8fc/aa9d988fc316c86dfda4a5165d36ea04.jpg"><br>  The package bundle and package is simple - a zip bag with a bunch of bubble bags in which the device itself is laid out, a small stand and a tiny USB receiver.  Fortunately, no drivers are needed - the device is easily recognized by the system as a USB HID Device.  The pen is powered by one AAA battery.  How many lives - is unknown, no statistics yet.  You can turn off the tiny switch. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/99f/695/f8a/99f695f8afb08dbabfa4a531569764b5.jpg"><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/3f3/60f/ef4/3f360fef49865a31549721c09280831f.jpg"><br><br><h4>  Drawing </h4><br>  Buying this gadget, to be honest, I did not particularly rely on the breakthrough possibilities of drawing.  So it turned out.  Yes, it is a bit more convenient to draw simple pictures with this pen than with a mouse, due to more precise finger movements.  Also, in the process of drawing the brush does not strain at all, which happens when drawing with the mouse.  However, the radically better drawings with this device does not come out.  Perhaps some skill is needed.  But rather, the fact is that I basically do not know how to draw, but I bought the device out of curiosity.

      Unfortunately I can not compare the convenience with a graphic tablet, because  never used the latter.  But, I suspect that the tablets of famous manufacturers more convenient.  At least because they are common, but similar devices are not. <br>  For more convenient drawing, it reduced the speed of the mouse in the system, so that the movement of the pen more closely corresponded to the result on the screen. <br>  I do not regret buying, for sure in some task it is useful.  May be useful to you.  Especially for the money.  I will not give any coordinates of sellers, look for on ebay "pen mouse". <br><br>  Traditional drawing at last. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/430/2ef/809/4302ef809c789ae09ebf652165868b4d.png"></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/158549/">https://habr.com/ru/post/158549/</a></p>
