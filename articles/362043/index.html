We wanted the best, but it seems we were misunderstood ‚Äù- something like this (if short and simplistic) you can still see the text on the site <a href="http://getpopcornti.me/">getpopcornti.me</a> .  More recently, you could download Popcorn Time, a media player that allows you to watch movies from torrent trackers in good quality directly - without downloading them to your hard drive. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  The program for a few weeks came up and created by the guys from Argentina, and called "Pochocl√≠n" ("popcorn" in Spanish).  Their main goal was not even to earn money, but to give people in different countries the opportunity to watch relatively new films for free: at home, in slippers and with popcorn.  The key word here is ‚Äúnew‚Äù, because in Argentina, thanks to copyright laws, the film ‚ÄúEverybody is crazy about Mary‚Äù, filmed in 1998, still belongs to the novelties. <br><br>  Popcorn Time immediately became popular, and received several excellent reviews from leading IT publications (including Time Magazine, Fast Company, TechCrunch, TUAW, Ars Technica, Washington Post, Huffington Post, Yahoo Finance, Gizmodo, PC Magazine and Torrent Freak), and even got into wikipedia.  Users (speaking 44 languages) fell in love with Popcorn Time for simplicity and convenience: the program simultaneously searched for a movie on YIFY, subtitles on OpenSubtitles, and metadata in the TheMovieDB database. <br><br>  The developers tried to place Popcorn Time in the official Google Play store, but they were denied due to a violation of intellectual property rights.  Despite this, the owners were confident in the legitimacy of their product, because they "... did not keep anything, did not earn, did not place ads, premium accounts and paid subscriptions."  From a technical point of view, Popcorn Time is legal: it is just a browser that organizes the broadcast of films using HTML, CSS and JavaScript.  But the structures protecting copyrights in different countries were considered different, and on March 14, 2014 the site and its repository on GitHub <a href="https://github.com/time4popcorn%3Ftab%3Drepositories">github.com/time4popcorn?tab=repositories</a> were removed.

Its administrators said that the new version of the application is more protected from the point of view of copyright, because it is built on its own API, and instead of TheMovieDB, the trakt.tv service is used to extract the metadata.  True, the legitimacy of Popcorn Time is still questionable in many countries - this is due to differences in legislation and is a problem rather the rights holders than users. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/999/051/545/9990515455bd46348fdb7a7ca96ef83d.png" alt="image"><br><br>  Popcorn Time still works efficiently, you can download it here <a href="https://popcorntime.io/">popcorntime.io</a> .  In addition to Android, the program is available on Windows 7/8, OS X (10.7 and higher) and Linux, and this list is updated every day. <br><br>  The current owners believe that a start has been made and now, even if the authorities ban Popcorn Time, it will be replaced by twins using the same principles of operation. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/362043/">https://habr.com/ru/post/362043/</a></p>
