I will open several dry cleaning sites to compare them.  If the information on the site is not enough for me, I close it.  If enough - I can throw the link to the price to someone: "Here, look, it's cheaper here."  I will not communicate with several companies on the phone to find out which dry cleaner suits me better; it will take a lot of time.  And on the phone, they will give me all the crap, and I do not like it. <br>  <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/krible/blog/258987/">habrahabr.ru/company/krible/blog/258987/#comment_8438313</a> </blockquote><br>  The thought has long matured in my head.  But just past <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/krible/blog/258987/">this</a> article with phrases like "Business needs a client to make contact: call or write." I could not get through.  This was the last straw, now I will sound everything I think. <br><br>  So, as usual - from afar.  The interaction between the buyer and the business (while talking about retail) has traditionally been built on the model of office / sales office / store - the buyer.  Open a point - luring customers.  This is from the business side.  On the buyer's side: need to repair the car, whiten the ceiling, buy groceries and a new vacuum cleaner?  Forward: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/ec2/bd4/f1f/ec2bd4f1f612b6fa267771f67d9063b2.jpg" alt="image"><br>  <i>The Internet today is this.</i>  <i>And it is sad to look at this - ‚Äúwalking shame‚Äù.</i> <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Look for yourself, ring up, run with your feet - like you need it.

      And then the Internet appeared, with the appearance of which it has not changed at all ... nothing.  Instead of office, a site, instead of a paper catalog, a search engine.  Thank you google for this.  It is necessary to repair the car, whiten the ceiling, buy products and a new vacuum cleaner - a search engine in the teeth and forward to ring up and write off.  And on the other side, I remind you, business.  These are the guys who need to call and poke in the voice menu, because the business has saved on the operator due to your convenience.  But sometimes it is even worse - marketers happen to businesses, but about this some other time. <br><br>  So, now about me.  This is me a client.  And this is my money.  And I do not care how wide and beautiful your office is, and I do not care what you need.  And I do not need you to call or write, or leave your data.  I need to solve my problem.  And the most interesting thing is that I have money, I remind you.  And you, dear business, do not need my call, but my money.  And as a person who is ready to transfer part of his money in exchange for a service or product, I want you to jump around me, not sit in their cool offices. <br><br>  I am talking, in fact, about tenders - and they are in big business.  A big company, comes to the tender site, shakes a bag of money and runs off those who allegedly need a call or a letter.  They are in the field of IT services - for this there are sites for freelancers.  2 excellent examples, so that I would not mind that it is possible only with very large or very small orders. <br><br>  And there is no middle ground.  There is nothing for a huge mass of everyday requests.  And all you need is a site like a freelance exchange with the ability to create requests.  Need a wardrobe?  Please: photographed the room, gave the dimensions, materials, wishes and compiled a questionnaire for the answers of these which the call is important: time, cost, other nuances.  Went off to drink coffee, came: you look at the table, compare, choose options, read reviews in a way convenient for the customer, and not in the variety of marketing works of art. <br><br>  In fairness, there are some initiatives in the field of personal services.  As an example, I will give Yandex Master.  Small assignments - YouDo. <br><br>  Only here what inventors of murderers are engaged - for me a riddle.  Killers instagrams and other facebookers, I mean.  Here it is a problem.  Here it is a huge market in which people throw coal into the furnace, instead of going in a comfortable car.  Solve the problem - there will be a business.  This business, and not the type of those marazmatik at the link at the beginning, who decided that there is a lot of information on the company's website - let the person hurt him even more - call and be in the script read by the operator to catch the necessary information. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/296678/">https://habr.com/ru/post/296678/</a></p>
