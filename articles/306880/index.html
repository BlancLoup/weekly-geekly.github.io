  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Login to IT</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"><p>  But amid the growth of wages in the IT industry, a movement called ‚Äúfind in IT‚Äù became popular.  This is when you live for yourself, study or work as a doctor or a lawyer, or do not work at all, and here you suddenly realize that everything is perishable, you need to go to IT.  There you can both Pokemon poganit, and drink a smoothie, and soak someone in the kitchen (when no one sees), but also pay for it.  And then, after the rain, IT courses began to appear, advanced training schools, they all became sharply experts in education, learned the terrible word "cursor", and some of the more fortunate ones also took a couple of grants.  To all entered in IT. </p><br><p>  Turn on the tune and go. </p><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/evE4SpLRl78%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,1500004,15700021,15700186,15700191,15700248,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhierVZzvlkeuJWVWNg3bQ3f30xXWw" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><a name="habracut"></a><br><p>  Many years ago, while still a student, sitting with friends who had already entered IT, we thought about how I could enter there.  Real knowledge at that time consisted in the knowledge of a certain number of Turbo Pascal functions, several CorelDraw filters and a dozen Movie songs.  The last one I was most proud of.  My colleague operated on complex words like "C plus plus", "Adobe Photoshop" and "Pehpe."  We have come to the conclusion that you won‚Äôt earn much on Photoshop, but in order to learn C ++ you need at least two years.  I didn‚Äôt want to endure the hungry games at the university for another two years, so I had to urgently look for some options.  So that you understand - the choice at that moment stood between ‚Äúgo with KVN team to Sochi‚Äù and ‚Äúgo to some office to get at least some experience, then, perhaps, to start earning something‚Äù.  The choice, of course, was for Sochi, but as a result I went to practice.  Or, as they say, in the internship. </p><br><p>  For a week, I had to learn HTML, for the second - CSS, in the third week they gave some typesetting to the site, a month later they were asked to write a script for perl (oh, horror), then it was necessary to set up the site for ColdFusion, then .NET 2.0, PHP, MySQL, MS SQL, the first serious independent project ... In general, 3 months passed quickly.  After three more I received my first earned salary - $ 40.  Per month.  A happier person was hard to find.  Although not.  There was a friend of mine, he earned as much as $ 200 and was older than me a whole course (the office sold him 5 hours of work per day at the price of two seniors).  He answered my questions, helped with assemblies, signed programs when I did not succeed.  In general, he was the one who is now called a mentor, for which he has a great respect. </p><br><p>  It seemed to me that I understood how it all works.  Therefore, already being in a different position, I, taking advantage of my official position, always tried to take 1-2 students to practice.  Because real experience is transmitted not only through textbooks or lectures, but in daily work with a person or people who care about you. </p><br><p>  Becoming the head of our own company, every year we began to recruit interns to work on social projects, R &amp; D and pet projects.  I will say right away that we never even got to R &amp; D, either because the internship was ending, or because we took the intern to the staff. </p><br><p>  We announced a new set for 2016 and, by luck, the ad was digested on a popular IT resource, thanks to which we received 50+ applications.  Considering the fact that 1-2 people were needed (it is difficult to physically pull more), the choice was not easy.  The key feature of the 2016 recruitment is that IT courses were indicated in the resume of all candidates.  Various.  Offline.  Online  Domestic.  Overseas.  They stood in the place where Microsoft Word and Microsoft Excel used to be (forgive Microsoft, but you hold on, all the best for you, good mood, health!). </p><br><p>  Here you have to make a lyrical digression and say that I hate sad interviews - well, there with hatches, who you see yourself in 5 years, etc.  as well as test remote tasks.  But it was not possible to view 50 resumes in a short period of time.  And then I sinned - I sent a test task to everyone, so that at least 20 of 50 remained. Candidates did not let us down - 5 people contacted the test task, 3 people sent a test task.  After 3 interviews of 5 minutes each, we took three of them to the internship. </p><br><p>  A little about the requirements.  Remote work, flexible schedule, one report a week, 2 (well, 3) hours a day maximum, a choice of technologies and projects, a subject area, 3 months, but we do not pay anything (but from each set of at least one we take on work - not because we need to take someone, but because the guys deserve it and are suitable for us).  Here I am writing this myself, and crying.  Nobody suggested such conditions to me :( People came different - both switchers, students, and already experienced wolves working as administrators in some network companies. But all that mattered was only one thing - is it ready to show a small but daily result, progress, In the end, passion is all ready! </p><br><p>  Result after 2 months.  One fell off due to straining with the main job, the second one stopped contacting after one and a half weeks, the third one found a permanent job, the fourth ... Ah, yes, the fourth one appeared some time after the Facebook post about interns survival statistics.  He decided by his example to check if he wrote everything correctly.  While we hold both. </p><br><p>  Oh yes, courses. </p><br><p>  A lot of courses.  Now there are two kinds of competing in my mailbox - gallant "we will do everything quickly and cheaply, give us a draft of the head of the project" Indians and young, but very promising QA specialists who are ready to work for the future and for someone else's benefit (it seems that they are taught one by one).  Two years ago, the Indians confidently won, but I hold my fists for QA, because all the same their relatives. </p><br><p>  Since there is not so much software in the world that all new QA can test all this, the brave IT courses are switched to another area - JavaScript or that they sell well - Full-Stack Development.  All you need to do is write in the summary everything that ends with JS - NodeJS, AngularJS, ReactJS (you can still add classics - wordpress and other pedepelde) and voila - the new Full stack developer was born.  But the characters forgot to explain what to write in a resume and know JavaScript and its derivatives are completely different things. </p><br><p>  For two months we were looking for an AngularJS developer.  Two fucking months, we were looking for one adequate developer AngularJS.  What I just have not heard enough pearls.  And "I added AngularJS to the resume, because I heard a lot of good things about him", "yes, I can go to work in 2 weeks, then I will go on vacation for a month and 5 pieces of money", "I saw what was written in the vacancy senior , but I'm just starting, I can work cheaper, "" I wrote on jQuery, I think I will figure it out in a couple of days. "  The same story was with QA Automation.  Well, there is a million QA, but here's a normal QA Automation you dick. </p><br><p>  Oh yes, courses. </p><br><p>  Courses and education in general is good.  The more courses, the better.  But, however sad it may be, there are practically no professional trainers at all IT courses.  Well, almost there.  More precisely, there is, but very little.  Very little - this means that for large numbers the limit of the function tends to 0. And there are a lot of people who want to enter ITI.  If you read the official figures and reports of these courses, it turns out that in a couple of years you will have to develop programs for leaving IT.  Since everyone will be in IT and there will be no one to drive buses.  And someone needs to drive buses.  In general, I do not want to live in a world where no one knows how to drive a bus. </p><br><p>  Some might think that I am against education and IT courses.  Haha  But believe me, you are still with the same person who wrote fifty articles on education, graduate school, research and science.  Because step and checkmate.  There is another. </p><br><p>  As before, nobody paid attention to the lines in the resume with Microsoft Word, and now the lines with the courses turn into a white spot.  And this is for some two years.  Quality?  The laws of mathematics?  Statistics?  All this remains the same.  There are nuggets, there are very motivated young people who are excited by the look of Fowler‚Äôs book, there are smart people without VO, there are stupid people with VO and vice versa, but the most important qualities that future IT people have are genuine interest in IT and a desire to work, develop and learn from morning till night. </p><br><p>  Who does not have these qualities, and there is only a desire to drink smoothies and earn a lot of money, can you not really need to enter IT, and it is better to go with KVN team to Sochi? </p><br><p>  And we will continue to continue to recruit and teach interns, because in conditions where state education is in the ass, there are very few people who really understand the sphere of education, and 3% of adequate people should not suffer because of the new and attractive trend called ‚Äúenter Aichi. " </p><br><p>  Thanks for attention! </p></div>
