  <section class="page js-page"><h1>What difficulties do buyers in foreign online stores face?</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  In 2015, Russian citizens spent $ 12 billion (760 billion rubles) on the Internet, and US residents almost 30 times more ($ 342 billion).  For the sixth year in a row, they increase their spending on the network by about 15%.  Last year, online sales in Russia grew by only 7%.  What do these numbers say?  Statistics reports a simple thing: online trading and the consumer goods market in the United States is tens of times more powerful.  This is a different level of competition, a different quality of products.  Several times higher than in Russia. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/c26/aa7/99a/c26aa799ab9e4756b97c66b5c6fcbfa2.jpg"></div><br>  "All the same, everything is collected in China," but produced for different markets - in different ways.  The same thing can be made from similar, but different in quality materials.  Guess where to send the thing from the best components - to the market, where sales amount to $ 300 billion, or to a country that buys only $ 12 billion? <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/07e/f80/a3f/07ef80a3f016461bbfb4ef94ba359445.jpg"><br><br>  Quality is not the only reason to buy at the largest marketplace.  Sales in the market, where 205 million Americans spend on average the most in the world, allows manufacturers to sell and earn more money by exposing lower prices.  Likewise, there is competition that drives prices down faster than in emerging markets.

      In Russia, few have yet appreciated products from the American market.  From the country of the most high-quality and inexpensive goods only 2% of the parcels come to us.  And the exchange rate in the exchanger is far from the only reason for this phenomenon: prices for high-quality goods in the United States are lower than in Russia, even when the dollar costs 70 rubles.  Mass demand is hampered by several obvious problems. <br><br><h2>  <font color="#ff8300">Money is paper (that's the problem)</font> </h2><br>  A buyer from Russia is often physically unable to make a purchase in an American online store.  A large overseas retailer Nordstrom just closed its site for users with a Russian IP address.  Another ten colleagues followed his example. <br><br>  Other overseas popular sellers do not accept payment from cards of Russian banks.  American versions of Apple, 6pm, Sephora, Levi's, Lee, Lego, Motorola, Nike, and the stores of many other global brands ‚Äúdo not take‚Äù Russian plastic.  What they do not like it? <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/a08/8d9/218/a088d92180b84a5ab01c09772e9201e9.png"></div><br>  Firstly, in American stores it is customary to comply with all laws and to be very sensitive to security issues - often to the detriment of their own income.  Each payment they undergo an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Address_Verification_System">AVS</a> (Address Verification System) system check.  It verifies the billing address that you specified when ordering at the store, so that it is available in the database of your credit institution or payment system.  AVS often cannot access information about the cardholder in her native Russian bank and rejects the payment. <br><br>  Sometimes the payment passes, the money on the card is blocked, but after some time a message about the cancellation of the purchase comes to the mail.  This means that AVS did not receive all the information or found an incomplete data correspondence.  The card transaction was considered risky, the store bank decided to ‚Äúnot get involved‚Äù, play it safe and cancel it.  This happens due to the fact that Russia since 2012 is ahead of the rest of the world in terms of the growth rate of losses from fraudulent operations with bank cards. <br><br>  Losses of clients of Russian banks from fraud only in retail outlets in 2015 amounted to 200 million rubles.  Fraudsters kidnap or copy cards, and then pay them in foreign stores.  A couple of years ago, on all channels, they told about a hacker who ordered a train with roses for his girlfriend.  He paid with just cards obtained by dishonest means. <br><br>  To prevent fraud, US banks are on guard payments.  And just what cancels card transactions - to compensate the costs of the law-abiding holder of "plastic" will have to conditional Bank of New York, whose payment terminal is installed, for example, Nike. <br><br>  Security is not the only reason why US companies limit access to their attractive market.  Global sellers ‚Äútake care‚Äù of their branches in other countries and try not to let their huge range of foreign buyers to theirs.  ‚ÄúLet them buy from themselves‚Äù - the logic is approximately the same. <br><br><h2>  <font color="#ff8300">Help with buying</font> </h2><br>  Shopping for our compatriots in US stores is not at all an expensive dollar, but rather the inability to spend it.  And as you already understood, the parcel post will help you easily bypass such barriers.  Since September of last year, several thousand residents of Russia have been successfully shopping in <u>all</u> American stores.  <a href="https://qwintry.com/ru/shopping-help%3F_openstat%3DR2Vla1RpbWVzO0dhZGdldHNfMjAxNjtQb3N0XzE7">The service is</a> extremely simple: you send a link to the product and replenish the account on qwintry.com, our operators buy the goods and control the delivery. <br><br>  Buy in America as quickly and easily as possible with the ‚Äú <a href="https://qwintry.com/landing/2016-help-free%3F_openstat%3DR2Vla1RpbWVzO0dhZGdldHNfMjAxNjtQb3N0XzE7">Help with buying</a> ‚Äù service.
