      <a href="http://www.lohmantech.com/how-it-works/">The device</a> , which was created specifically for the diagnosis of <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%25A4%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B1%25D1%2580%25D0%25B8%25D0%25BB%25D0%25BB%25D1%258F%25D1%2586%25D0%25B8%25D1%258F_%25D0%25BF%25D1%2580%25D0%25B5%25D0%25B4%25D1%2581%25D0%25B5%25D1%2580%25D0%25B4%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B9">atrial fibrillation</a> , although it records the ECG completely.  After the procedure, the user receives instant color notifications, and if the ‚Äúred phone‚Äù lights up, you must immediately contact the doctor!  A yellow indicator means that the data has not been received, and green, which is logical, indicates that there are no risks at the moment.  During the measurement, the heart rate is displayed. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/250/2da/74d/2502da74d77345409e73f9a523897497.jpg"><br><br>  ECG data can be extracted in several different ways, including using mobile applications for IOS and Android.  The user can also upload them via USB to a computer and send AfibAlert to the cloud in order to open the possibility for his doctor to work with them. <br><br>  <b>Alivecor</b> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/b5d/37a/813/b5d37a81330a42b29486264dbf104612.jpg"><br><br>  <a href="http://www.alivecor.com/home">Case</a> for a mobile phone that allows you to record an ECG.  Pretty "loud" project, actively supported by the press.  Measurement data remain in the memory of the smartphone, they can be viewed on the computer.  Also for an additional fee you can get a decryption cardiologist. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/1e5/074/ea0/1e5074ea03424c948627e1c3774c1d57.jpg"><br><br>  Measurements are most conveniently done by placing your fingers on the device‚Äôs contacts.  At the same time, it is possible to ‚Äúchange‚Äù the leads by taking measurements from the chest or by attaching the cover to the leg.  Currently, the range has expanded, and users are invited to buy a separate "plate" with contacts instead of a cover. <br><br>  <b>Cardioqvark</b> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/1d3/f61/f74/1d3f61f74a7e4daba401b5366b354681.png"><br><br>  <a href="http://cardioqvark.ru/">One more cover</a> about which <a href="https://geektimes.ru/users/alinatestova/" class="user_link">alinatestova</a> recently wrote <a href="https://geektimes.ru/post/270566/">on Geektimes</a> .  Despite the external similarity with AliveCor, the device works on a different technology, and its menu is slightly more informative.  At the meeting with the authors of the project, they explained to us that the project had started the process of obtaining a medical certificate, and at the moment it is undergoing clinical trials in Moscow hospitals. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/620/7fd/3f7/6207fd3f75704f6ab922480ba4f69f9b.jpeg"><br><br>  Cardio Quark allows you to keep ECG records, monitor the balance of the autonomic nervous system, analyze stress levels.  For the convenience of the user, there is a ‚Äútraffic light scale‚Äù in the application, which is not a diagnosis!  But it tells you how satisfactory / unsatisfactory the condition is.  The rest of the application communicates in a ‚Äúmedical‚Äù language, which is understandable to the cardiologist, whose services are available in the cloud service. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/599/c97/4e8/599c974e85eb413493b9ad8b5921bbee.jpg"><br><br>  The project was created by domestic scientists. <br><br>  <b>ECG-Chek</b> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/9ad/692/542/9ad6925427a640bbbc8e002420f95d04.png"><br><br>  Another <a href="http://www.ecgcheck.com/">case</a> with two electrodes, which allows you to record an ECG on a smartphone or view it on a computer.  It has its own warning system. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/d00/56a/2d2/d0056a2d2deb4c4fbd807ce09082989b.jpg"><br><br>  <b>Cardiopad</b> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/d00/076/7fc/d000767fc25145d7ad7e7caabf6ad744.jpg"><br><br>  The most similar to both of the previous ones is CardioPad from <a href="https://geektimes.ru/company/medgadgets/blog/266852/">RootiLabs</a> .  In fact, it will be a slightly cheaper analogue of the <a href="https://geektimes.ru/post/262774/">W / me2 tracker</a> , and in this case, the ability to measure pressure will also remain a key advantage over other gadgets. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/579/b3c/c65/579b3cc6528f477c9c984b926bdb23dd.png"><br><br>  While the CardioPad interface is not completely clear, and perhaps it will work together with the W / me2 application.  In the same place the ECG is shown in this format: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/5e8/fd9/f89/5e8fd9f89e8e4de7b085b51201c3cc89.jpg"><br><br>  In Russia, W / me2 appeared in September last year, and so far we have devoted quite a lot of time to software.  In the latest update, the ability to calibrate the device became available, after which the pressure readings became even more accurate. <br><br>  <b>Dimetek micro</b> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/4cd/65c/eda/4cd65cedad2d4b758faaf3057fac9e95.jpg"><br><br>  Portable and <a href="http://www.dimetekus.com/Micro-Ambulatory-ECG-Recorder_p238.html">autonomous device</a> approved by the FDA.  It can be used in several modes, including as a holter - for continuous monitoring.  The data is stored in the device‚Äôs memory; therefore, access to them by the doctor is impossible.  In order to get a consultation, it is necessary to extract: print or send the ECG by mail. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/94c/abc/5ad/94cabc5add5340f284cacb682c22546f.jpg"><br><br>  "Express-ECG" can be recorded from two fingers, while for longer monitoring it is proposed to use electrodes, which also complete the device.  Plus, this bundled special bag for carrying. <br><br>  <b>Heartcheck pen</b> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/26e/18e/389/26e18e38948448d4913783e142fc3792.jpg"><br><br>  The <a href="http://www.theheartcheck.com/">pen</a> was once the first device that was approved by the FDA.  Convenient to carry in your pocket, easy to use, and the principle of action - hold with two fingers. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/7d3/9a6/207/7d39a62078fc42dd8e0f8e8d2b2845f9.jpg"><br><br>  The device is recommended as a means of monitoring after heart attacks, strokes or heart surgeries.  Also helps to track the effects of drugs on health.  No additional wires and electrodes are provided.  Up to 20 measurements are stored in the device‚Äôs memory, after which they must be stored on a computer.  The pen itself has a small digital display. <br><br>  <b>InstantCheck</b> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/21d/67a/c64/21d67ac649dd45248450dbede288c333.jpg"><br><br>  <a href="http://www.dcbiomed.com/webls-en-us/InstantCheck:V4.0.html">The</a> ECG device <a href="http://www.dcbiomed.com/webls-en-us/InstantCheck:V4.0.html">similar to the console</a> offers 30-second records that can be instantly observed on the display, saved in the device's memory, and then retrieved to the computer using a cable. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/c27/5b6/f9a/c275b6f9a548437b98fc39d6e5f8dcd0.jpg"><br><br>  There is also a continuous monitoring mode, but you cannot call it full-fledged holter, since the recording is carried out anyway in the last 30 seconds! <br><br>  <b>ChoiceMmed MD100E</b> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/9eb/bfd/cd8/9ebbfdcd8fb145bb8b734dfccd4abb4d.jpg"><br><br>  <a href="http://www.choicemmed.com/">The device</a> has a display that allows you to instantly display data, allows you to capture the ECG using your fingers thanks to the electrodes located on the sides or using special cables, which are also included. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/fce/658/46d/fce65846d7f34e07b237e645602cdae9.jpg"><br><br>  The display shows the entire measurement process, and in the final a brief analytics is offered: a general characteristic in the form of a smiley system and data on heart rate.  For further work with the data you need a computer and special software that is attached on the disk. <br><br>  <b>ECG PC-80B</b> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/cf8/691/3fc/cf86913fcfa44880b29dd3c15917fbdc.jpg"><br><br>  Simple, compact and one of the first portable ECG monitors that has survived several generations.  Currently, the more known model <a href="http://www.creative-sz.com/Easy-ECG-Monitor/Easy-ECG-Monitor-PC-80C.html">80B</a> . <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/75a/eae/b19/75aeaeb194814bd1a9e53932e997579d.jpg"><br><br>  The model allows you to shoot ECG from anywhere (chest, legs, hands), stores up to 10 hours of data in memory and allows you to share them with devices via Bluetooth, USB or Zigbee.  Data then, of course, can be printed. <br><br>  <b>Reka E100</b> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/893/6d5/6c0/8936d56c00454eb7aadc9f535f214056.jpg"><br><br>  Characterized as the <a href="https://www.rekahealth.com/en/ecg/e100.html">easiest device</a> with easy access to data on a computer or, more recently, using a smartphone.  The gadget does not have its own display, and ECG can be recorded again in two ways: by squeezing your fingers in the right places or using cables. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/262/00c/423/26200c42331b4ccb8430822b233808a9.jpg"><br><br>  <b>ECG Dongle</b> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/197/272/657/197272657e3944e099bbd5ae2c6dff5b.jpg"><br><br>  <a href="http://medgadgets.ru/shop/ecg-dongle.html%3Futm_source%3Dgeekecg%26utm_medium%3Dflashka%26utm_campaign%3Ddongl">Russian development</a> , to which we have <a href="https://geektimes.ru/company/medgadgets/blog/270294/">devoted a review</a> , where one of the authors of the project spoke in the comments.  A flash drive connects to an Android smartphone using a specially designed adapter, and the recorded results ‚Äúfall‚Äù into the device‚Äôs memory. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/343/c91/dd1/343c91dd1e40425a980fc6a47fcea5cd.jpg"><br><br>  It is also proposed to use the cloud, where you can get comments from cardiologists for an additional fee.  According to the creators, now is the process of obtaining all the necessary medical papers for the device. <br><br>  <b>Contec ECG80A</b> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/953/09b/cb3/95309bcb3bd84bd88335f49f46643ae3.jpg"><br><br>  A full portable <a href="http://www.contecmed.com/index.php%3Fpage%3Dshop.product_details%26flypage%3Dflypage.tpl%26product_id%3D92%26category_id%3D11%26option%3Dcom_virtuemart%26Itemid%3D605">12-channel cardiograph</a> , which immediately prints an ECG.  In parallel to this, real-time ECG data is displayed on a small device display. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/c2d/195/969/c2d195969f474acb96512b6dc75e4c4a.jpg"><br><br>  The device does not have an internal memory, so it is necessary to carefully monitor the tape, as with its lack of data will be completely lost. <br><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">A source</b> <div class="spoiler_text">  <b>For those who are interested</b> : Probably the <a href="https://www.ndsu.edu/pubweb/~grier/Comparison-handheld-ECG-EKG.html">most detailed analysis of most</a> of the ECG devices presented here with detailed unboxes, screenshots, characteristics.
