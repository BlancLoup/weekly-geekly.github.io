  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Advertising got to the Russians mobile phones</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  <strong>The Big Three operators are ready to offer to their subscribers a list of advertising messages in exchange for certain discounts and bonuses.</strong>  <strong>A pilot project for the sale of advertising space on information channels was announced by VimpelCom, the launch of MegaFon and MTS projects is expected soon.</strong>  <strong>Analysts believe that mobile advertising will be a good source of additional income for operators, although it will not bring super profits.</strong> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/651/240/5d0/6512405d0171cd912d6774b5b61e56a6.jpg"><br><br>  The Russian operators included in the so-called ‚Äúbig three‚Äù, following the example of the largest western cellular companies, are launching mobile advertising projects for subscribers.  The launch of a pilot project for the sale of advertising space on its information channels has already been announced by VimpelCom.

    <a name="habracut"></a>  Advertising will be available to all Beeline subscribers in Russia through the WAP-portal, USSD-portal, universal IVR answering machine, the Chameleon project.  In VimpelCom they assured that a subscriber could receive advertising messages only by expressing consent to this (with the exception of visits to the WAP portal).  In exchange for viewing ads you can use various bonuses and discounts from advertisers. <br><br>  VimpelCom will not be independently engaged in the sale of advertising space - the Brand Mobile agency is called for this.  The unit of sales for mobile advertising will be the CPT unit used in online advertising, that is, the cost per 1000 contacts.  Placement for 1000 contacts on WAP- and USSD-portals within the framework of the pilot project is 614 rubles, including VAT, on the IVR-portal - 920 rubles, on the Chameleon channel - 153 rubles.  Depending on the volume of the contract, advertisers will be able to take advantage of a progressive scale of discounts. <br><br>  Advertisers will be able to choose one of the advertising message formats: a graphic banner with text, a simple graphic banner, a text banner teaser, an interactive menu with advertising content, or a voice interactive menu with advertising content.  In addition, advertisers will be able to address an advertising message to different groups of users, depending on the size of the average account, context, subscriber geography, phone model and consumer preferences. <br><br>  As Zinaida Khokhlova, director of mass market marketing for VimpelCom, noted, among the advantages of mobile advertising is interactivity, the possibility of better segmentation.  ‚ÄúIn addition, at the initial stage, competition among advertisers will be low, which will ensure better visibility and memorability of the advertising message,‚Äù Ms. Khokhlova emphasized. <br><br>  For a couple of months, work has been carried out on the introduction of mobile advertising in MegaFon.  The company sees the greatest potential as an advertising carrier in the WAP-portal ‚ÄúMegaFon PRO‚Äù, which has several distribution channels for advertising information: placement of graphic banners, branding of media content, joint holding of events on the WAP portal (actions, draws, quizzes).  Advertising will be sold at other sites using RBT, ICB, SMS, MMS technologies in different configurations. <br><br>  ‚ÄúIf necessary, we can transfer the MSISDN (number) of the subscriber to the advertiser‚Äôs external WAP resource,‚Äù a source in MegaFon said.  ‚ÄúWe can also provide a qualitative assessment of the attendance of a resource, but without transferring personal data of the subscriber, as otherwise it would contradict the current legislation.‚Äù  Like VimpelCom, MegaFon plans to attract an intermediary agency to sell advertising. <br><br>  Until the end of 2007, a mobile advertising service will be offered to MTS subscribers.  ‚ÄúCarefully following the trends in this market, we are working on a number of ideas related to mobile advertising,‚Äù the operator‚Äôs press service told.  - The services requested by him will be offered to the subscriber, and the advertising will be delivered strictly with his prior consent.  Services based on mobile advertising will involve the entire range of communication channels that MTS has. ‚Äù <br><br>  Analysts are sure that it will be difficult for operators to achieve a high income due to mobile advertising, but new projects will certainly have a certain economic effect.  ‚ÄúIn a saturated market, mobile advertising will bring additional revenue to operators,‚Äù said Anton Pogrebinsky, partner at AC &amp; M Consulting.  ‚ÄúMany subscribers will certainly agree to receive advertising in exchange for various discounts.‚Äù <br><br>  According to the forecast of Informa Telecoms and Media, in 2011 the global mobile advertising market will amount to $ 11.3 billion, whereas in 2005 it was zero. <br><br>  <a href="http://www.cnews.ru/">CNews.ru</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/14692/">https://habr.com/ru/post/14692/</a></p>
