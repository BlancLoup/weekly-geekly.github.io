I will analyze my situation exclusively, I think others will not have a similar one, but it may be similar. <br>  Let me remind you that in accordance with <a href="http://www.leaninfo.ru/2011/07/06/muda-mura-muri-lean-alphabet/">publication 2,</a> ‚Äúloss‚Äù in Japanese is called ‚Äúmuda‚Äù, this is any activity that consumes resources, but does not create value for the client. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  <b>So, Muda 1: losses due to excess stocks.</b> <br>  This type of telecom loss includes: <br>  - a communication network that does not pay off; <br>  - stocks. <br><br>  <i>Communication network</i>

    <img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/768/4fd/4cb/7684fd4cb5da4778bf8593ab9b55714c.jpg"><br><br>  In general, this is a controversial issue, because in telecommunications, the communications network is the basis of the company's capitalization, so to speak ‚Äúthe main means‚Äù.  However, from the definition of ‚Äúmuddy‚Äù, if a communications network consumes resources (and in any case resources are required for its construction and maintenance) and does not ‚Äúcreate values ‚Äã‚Äãfor the client‚Äù in the form of communications services, then this is indeed a loss.  Those.  in any case, the communication network should generate revenue, and one that covers the costs (‚Äúcaptain obvious‚Äù?).  Income from a communication network can be obtained from its growth and from an increase in the profitability of a constructed network.  Usually, the ‚Äúincrease in profitability‚Äù is pushed, for it is easier to raise the total income at the expense of growth.  Any growth network requires investment.  The greater the growth, the greater the investment, i.e. the expenses that commerce always seeks to reduce.  With a decrease in investment and growth is crooked.  They built up to a certain area, "skimmed off" from 1-2 large customers and ran on.  Then these customers left, the network became immediately unprofitable.  What to do?  It is possible to dismantle the nodes of this segment of the communication network, reducing the costs of them, we can recall the increase in profitability of the constructed network.  Usually choose the first option, because it is easier.  All this is treated only by increasing the profitability of the communication network built, but here the question of "how" is in charge of the merchant sellers and their motivation. <br><br>  <i>Stocks.</i> <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/c5e/a0d/b82/c5ea0db829f7469e8c0312c0f9c44f1a.jpg"><br>  In order to reduce the time it takes to purchase equipment and materials, as well as reduce dependence on suppliers' problems, a warehouse stock is usually created in telecom.  Replenishment of stocks is a necessary thing, it allows to reduce client connection time.  However, the list of equipment and materials ordered by techies, and purchases their supply service, which does not care about the actual need of a particular position.  If the suppliers have not yet clearly set the task, then ‚Äúaccording to the law of universal harmfulness‚Äù absolutely something is bought.  Further, a number of list items soon ceases to be relevant, new items appear in the purchasing list, and old items are not removed from the list.  This "iron" is in stock and no one uses it.  How to fight?  In theory, it is necessary that this list of equipment is updated constantly.  Automation of procurement processes helps very well.  If you want to add a new position to the list, delete the old one, even if the old one is still not quite old. <br>  However, there is one more thing.  When upgrading the communication network, the old equipment is dismantled and sent back to the warehouse.  Over time, it becomes very much.  Sometimes attempts are made to sell it all.  It is usually unfortunate, because there is more fuss than benefits, especially since the equipment is really old and no one uses it at all.  In the future, just giving up for scrap or thrown away. <br>  How to fight?  Dismantled equipment must be sold immediately while it is still in demand.  Of course there may be against accounting, because for the price for which the piece of metal is ready to buy, they are not ready to sell it.  But otherwise, in my opinion, only to increase this option is wise. <br><br>  <b>Muda 2: losses due to unnecessary transportation.</b> <br><br>  Here I would refer the problems related to the fact that someone is doing something wrong, having become accustomed to doing it ‚Äúin the old manner‚Äù when ‚Äúeveryone did it this way‚Äù.  Personal professional incompetence is the cause of these losses.  New technologies of the industry provide new knowledge, new work orders, new tools, new materials.  If they are not used, the quality of work is reduced, and the terms are increased. <br>  How to fight?  It helps banal employee training, and not just ordinary.  It's great if it is periodic and covers all services.  It is not necessary to send everyone to study, you can send one or two with the subsequent load of training colleagues. <br><br>  <b>Muda 3: losses due to overproduction.</b> <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/3d7/6cf/447/3d76cf44721a443fbc3f689eadd040fa.jpg"><br>  This would include the operational loss of the maintenance or restoration of the communications network.  It is connected tightly with Muda 1. Often, when a client is connected, they save on the necessary expenses so much that then the costs of operation sharply increase.  Saved on the client connection method - we got the need for engineer‚Äôs daily trips to solve problems.  Eliminated by only one - a reasonable justification of the installation payments and shifting further operating costs on the budget of the same people who ordered the work.  Speech is not necessarily about the end customer, it's about the commercial department of telecom. <br><br>  <b>Muda 4: loss of time due to waiting.</b> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/a10/6ea/bcc/a106eabcc5c54814862f5cad109d2c65.jpg"><br><br>  As they say, waiting and catching up is the most ungrateful thing, especially in telecom.  If in anticipation of any approvals (contracts by lawyers or accountants) or approvals (projects by different committees) you also encounter the fear of specific individuals to make decisions, take responsibility, then in general the case is ‚Äútrumpet‚Äù.  When someone asks you to prepare a material for consideration of a project on any financial committee, and then the first one votes against it - this strongly affects your motivation.  Even worse, because of these expectations, there are indeed problems on the communication network and increased Mud loss 3. <br><br>  <b>Muda 5: losses due to unnecessary processing steps.</b> <br><br>  For this loss, you can rant for a very long time.  I will dwell on the practice of holding meaningless and endless meetings.  In management theory there is one pattern: the duration of the meeting and the number of its participants are inversely proportional to the effectiveness of the meeting.  The less people gather for a meeting, and the less they consult in duration, the more effective the meetings are.  The ideal meeting of 3 interested people for 20 minutes.  It must always be remembered that a meeting is a way of making decisions by a working group.  Therefore, before the meeting, everyone should know what topic they are going to have, what options they have.  Each participant must leave the meeting with a specific task (who, what does, by what date and how).  Otherwise, options are possible, such as, ‚Äúwe are thinking about this issue until the next meeting,‚Äù or ‚Äúwe continue to think about this issue‚Äù, or ‚Äúbut let's nevertheless emphasize the technical requirements (algorithm, order, etc., we need to emphasize)‚Äù.  All this should already be ready for the meeting in the form of options.  I also admit that when people are going to ‚Äúcrack‚Äù on a topic or simply tell the boss what is happening on one or another topic, they would call it ‚Äúinforming‚Äù. <br>  I will not say that because of these losses, new telecommunication services are being introduced for a long time or projects are being slowed down. <br><br>  <b>Muda 6: losses due to unnecessary movements.</b> <br><br>  A client calls to his telecom with some kind of problem, and they begin to redirect him several times to a new employee because the client with whom he spoke hasn't been able to solve his problem for one reason or another.  It is complicated if every time the client is forced to repeat the description of his problem.  Common situation?  The idea should be treated by the fact that there are people in the office who can solve any problems of the client.  Usually this duty is imposed on technical support.  The difficulty is that their competence for this must be sufficiently high. <br>  It happens in a different way; several different people from the telecom call the client at different times and ask again the same thing on the same topic.  The problem is peculiar to projects in which there is no one responsible, when everyone is responsible only for his piece.  However, if there is no responsible person, then he must be assigned. <br><br>  <b>Muda 7: losses due to the release of defective products.</b> <br><br>  Classic quality problem.  Worked with the client so that an hour later he gave back the non-working service or, worse, the segment of the communication network "fell on its side and did not want to get up."  When you start to understand, the reasons are banal - they worked carelessly with the coupling and touched the working fiber, prescribed rough routing and killed the whole addressing pool, etc. Lack of competence, accuracy, non-observance of the rules of production processes, etc. It is well treated by one rule: ‚Äú Nakosyachil - and fix it yourself. "  Leave the place, apologize to the customers, and if because of this and other tasks (yours + others) you fill up - be sure, the Homeland will not forget you. <br><br>  <b>Muda 8: unrealized creativity of employees.</b> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/b15/104/ba9/b15104ba98e046c8beb9009cd8fee65b.jpg"><br><br>  I will not open America if I say that projects that are initiated and executed by the same employees are best implemented.  Successfully implemented or simply launched projects on the initiative from below also ‚Äúlight the fire‚Äù in the eyes of colleagues.  However, these lights extinguish the response of the manager in the style of "do not make a wave."  A couple of times I ‚Äúput out the light‚Äù, you see, and the subordinate stopped going out with the initiative or began to grumble about ‚Äúthe swamp, nobody needs anything.‚Äù  Working in such a team is still a pleasure, although everything is predictable and some people like it.  Here are just a breakthrough will not be there.  Is it good or bad?  In the developing telecom it is bad, because the market does not stand still and it is necessary to promptly respond to its challenges.  And here it is necessary for the leader to push the realization of the initiative of his colleagues, having thoroughly analyzed them for adequacy.  In the telecom, which is being reformed according to the instructions from above (tell me, what do we need to do?), The lack of initiative from below is good, because those who ‚Äúdo not drive a wave‚Äù are also chosen. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/299536/">https://habr.com/ru/post/299536/</a></p>
