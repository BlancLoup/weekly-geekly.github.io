  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Electronic queue or problems of its use and implementation</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  A couple of days ago, a <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/e_gov/69505/">topic</a> on the introduction of an electronic queue in a state institution of the Kurgan region appeared on Habr√©.  The author of the topic decided to go his own way and write his system for the necessary tasks specifically for this institution.  For which I express great respect.  What did I want to highlight in my first topic you ask?  I would like to write about the use of such systems and what the team that implements such systems faces. <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  Let's start with the fact that just a couple of years ago there were only a few such systems and they cost a lot of money.  As for the current situation on the market, I know about 13 such systems that are being introduced in Russia.  Each has its own pros and cons, and that is nice most of it is Russian development.  With regards to prices, it can vary quite in a large range. <br><br>  Currently, many companies are thinking about the quality of customer service, as competition is increasing every year.  Personnel are constantly being trained to improve the quality of customer service, new solutions are being introduced, and simply ‚Äúgingerbread‚Äù are offered to customers.

      The electronic queue or, as it is also called, the Queue Management System is one of the technical solutions and a fairly young area in Russia.  Now many companies - system integrators are seeking to implement projects.  But they face certain difficulties: <br><br>  <b>The first is complexity</b> .  Many potential customers do not understand how such a system will help solve the problem with the queue and the fact that the cost of implementation quickly pays off.  After all, if the client came and in the branch of the same bank a large queue, he does not need to constantly monitor whom he took the queue, but can calmly read a newspaper or magazine. <br><br>  <b>The second difficulty</b> .  Manufacturing companies compete with their partners and can often kill in price.  My personal opinion is that this is not good.  The partner begins to wonder whether it is worth it to do it at all.  Again, in Russia just a couple of manufacturing companies do not compete with partners. <br><br>  <b>The third difficulty</b> .  Basically, all manufacturers are selling a complete solution - that is, software and hardware as a single complex.  Often, such solutions are not effective in terms of budget and capacity.  There are solutions on the market that are not tied to specific equipment.  Of course, each solution has its pros and cons, but for me it is better to buy the software separately, and the equipment separately.  First, the customer has more choice, and secondly, it often turns out cheaper. <br><br>  <b>The fourth difficulty,</b> and probably the most basic, why such systems do not work after implementation, is the boycott by the staff of the institution of such a system.  People do not want to be controlled, or rather do not want to work.  In fact, the system helps to work, and does not interfere, since there are no kilometer queues in front of each receiving window. <br><br>  What benefit brings the introduction of such a system for the customer: <br>  <b>1</b> .  The customer gets rid, albeit not completely, of the tense situation among customers and employees. <br>  <b>2</b>  It can analyze the work of the staff and see who works how and how much time the staff spends on solving certain customer issues.  As a result, it is possible to correctly distribute responsibilities for the provision of certain services among staff. <br>  <b>3</b>  Increases customer loyalty to your company. <br><br>  Perhaps this is not a complete list of all the benefits, but I believe that this is already a big plus. <br><br>  At the moment, the main customers of such systems are companies of the banking, insurance sectors and government agencies.  And I want to note that implementation in state structures is more often easier than in commercial structures. <br><br>  What sways prices for the purchase of equipment and system implementation, it starts from 180 thousand rubles.  There were cases when the project costs 800-900 thousand rubles for one point. <br><br>  PS Perhaps not covered all the problems and advantages of use.  I think it will be possible to add in the comments.  Please do not kick, the first post on Habr√©. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/69690/">https://habr.com/ru/post/69690/</a></p>
