As a rule, they are completed with an illiquid "iron", they are assembled with the left foot and are buggy mercilessly.  Therefore, to the new low-cost smartphones Highscreen - Omega Q and Spark - went extremely hard.  And that's what came of it. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/8ca/913/79a/8ca91379a9730f79d98ff235b175bac9.jpg"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Perhaps the most famous smartphone of this brand was the Explosion, the ‚Äúbrother‚Äù of the Samsung Galaxy SIII with a noticeably reduced cost.  He cleverly positioned as the most affordable device with a quad-core processor, and at that time it was true.  Now his place was taken by Omega Q, for which they want 8 990 rubles.  - three thousand less.  It is logical to assume that a lot has changed in it. <br><br><h4>  At first sight </h4><br>  The first difference is immediately visible - the box.  It is not the same as everyone else, including the new Spark.  For some reason, the corporate style (cardboard box of ‚Äúcardboard‚Äù color with a lid) was changed, not beyond recognition, but much: now the main part, and the white one, leaves the cover like a desk drawer.  The lid itself has not changed color, and the phone with the signed internals is still painted, but to the touch it is now plastic and completely smooth.  Of course, most buyers will contact her only in the first hours after the purchase, but still this transformation looks rather strange. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/f71/c3e/a57/f71c3ea572c08f6274eae87a83870669.jpg"><br>  The second surprise is waiting for us inside the box.  As you know, Highscreen smartphones are equipped with a charger and headphones.  So, now they are white!  This, of course, is beautiful and fashionable (not for nothing that the flagships paint it that way), they only get dirty faster and not everyone likes the combination with the black case.  But the quality of the headphones has become better, it is already possible not to replace them with others.  And for some reason, these accessories cause an association with apple products ... <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/f2f/955/481/f2f95548171e91fd911acef5d639f751.jpg">

    <h5>  Appearance </h5><br>  Omega Q is slightly longer and thinner than Explosion (9 mm versus 9.9), the corners are not so rounded, and the back cover is glossy. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/571/d1b/b33/571d1bb333e8de8af4b45186ac2d283e.jpg"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/d25/28e/57b/d2528e57ba1b19afe74c4d72681b846b.jpg"><br>  The silver frame on the sides and the ends gives the smartphone elegance, and there are buttons on it (power on, volume on the right) and connectors (mini-jack 3.5 mm for headphones on the top, microUSB - below). <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/1cd/9f3/5b0/1cd9f35b09f2d5ed974cd8e7d400058f.jpg"><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/436/4eb/1f0/4364eb1f07aa10ccfc8b66a12d2a394f.jpg"><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/7ea/ad1/c76/7eaad1c769aa97bb16748db7c2dd3a91.jpg"><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/670/62c/dd1/67062cdd1f258106e099db3df58f0230.jpg"><br>  IPS-display - 4.5 inches, resolution 960 x 540 pixels.  It feels like it is exactly the same as that of Highscreen Blast, which is slightly cheaper and more modest in performance.  The sun fades a little, but the backlight is bright and uniform, and the colors are juicy, but quite realistic. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/7ee/e98/b24/7eee98b241ea7705a2cb09ae9193f604.jpg"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/fa2/526/04f/fa252604fddcb38c50ac857d96860c90.jpg"><br><br><h4>  Opportunities </h4><br>  Here it is, the cornerstone of positioning: a quad-core Qualcomm MSM8225Q Snapdragon S4 Play with a frequency of 1.2 GHz.  It's not a secret that lately we pay more attention to the frequency and ‚Äúnuclear‚Äù of a processor in a smartphone than in a computer (well, who remembers the memory of your PC or MacBook TTX?).  It works really faster than the dual-core Blast, which is especially noticeable when playing HD videos from YouTube.  Do not discount the gigabytes of RAM, and Android 4.1 and the promised updates add a lot of points to the inner beauty of Highscreen Omega Q. By performance, it overtakes the same Samsung Galaxy Note, which is clearly seen in comparison to the AnTuTu benchmark. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/187/cb5/2af/187cb52af8933c8b69fde2e34dc03fb6.jpg"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/a52/b9f/be5/a52b9fbe521480044c1412b76a621d2a.jpg"><br><br>  What is interesting, to reduce the cost of the cost of the smartphone almost nothing is cut out.  GPS, two SIM cards, Bluetooth 3.0 - everything is there.  No luck only the battery and the front camera.  However, I can not say that 1,600 mAh behaved much worse than 2,100 in my Samsung Galaxy S III smartphone: Highscreen takes care of energy saving.  But the peephole of the front camera gives only 640 x 480 pixels (0.3 megapixels), which is hardly enough for Skype.  A person will be considered, and if you want to show a document or something small, they begin to ask again.  The main camera with five megapixels feels as good as eight in other Highscreen smartphones, so I won‚Äôt be scolding here. <br>  May not be enough and internal memory.  2.7 GB is available, but there is a microSD card slot (16 GB reads without problems).  My requests are modest: some music, a few hundred photos and a new series ‚ÄúThe Big Bang Theory‚Äù for viewing in the subway.  But if you need to keep there a dozen films, navigation and a bunch of games - put in the budget 500-1000 rubles per card. <br><br><h4>  Highscreen spark </h4><br>  Before drawing conclusions, I will tell you about my younger brother Omega Q - Highscreen Spark.  They are together in press releases and even for the test are issued in pairs, because Spark is now the cheapest smartphone with a dual-core processor (3,990 rubles). <br>  It is in many ways reminiscent of the Strike model, differing in design and details: a camera without autofocus, a thicker body (it seemed to me more comfortable), there is no separate search button, typical of more expensive Highscreen smartphones. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/b2d/e01/070/b2de0107076cc0076b5321dd062e0777.jpg"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/129/22c/592/12922c592f52bd41e14419a2f7fa2583.jpg"><br>  The features of the face ... that is, the appearance is common, its design is not outstanding, but it looks quite in the spirit of the times and certainly more expensive than it is evaluated.  At the bottom, the case is getting thinner, which reminded me of the Motorola PEBL U6, an old-fashioned and incredibly fashionable one at one time.  True, she did not have a 4-inch screen with a resolution of 480 x 800 pixels. <br>  There are few external controls: power and volume. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/a29/564/ff2/a29564ff2e7f3f0edf1b194731b80762.jpg"><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/e5d/5c0/5fa/e5d5c05fa84a6ab4569874c9e2f960f1.jpg"><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/c32/846/1fe/c328461fe7959260d0e38d3b9b64f767.jpg"><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/a28/a91/bee/a28a91beeab1f2cd382351f1828a0f99.jpg"><br><br>  Characteristics by today's standards are modest (Qualcomm MSM8225 processor with a frequency of 1 GHz, 512 MB of RAM), but for an economy class - just right.  At the very least, you can play Subway Surfers without any problems, and it also draws streaming video as it should.  In the test AnTuTu smartphone scored 6003 points. <br>  For those who like to optimize the cost of communication, there is a second slot for a SIM card. <br><br><h4>  A spoon of tar </h4><br>  Well, we can not mention separately the shortcomings of the models.  First of all, design.  Girls when choosing a smartphone are always greedy for design.  Even if the brand is not the most famous, but the phone is outwardly noticeable and attractive - they will buy it.  Highscreen Spark outwardly does not cause any emotions at all, Omega Q is rather thin, but in general it is also devoid of any zest.  However, budget smartphones for the most part do not indulge in designer excesses, right? <br><br>  There is one subjective claim to the assembly: in Omega Q and Spark, it is inconvenient to open the back cover, almost nothing to catch on.  But I rearrange the Sims here and there, and many will climb inside once. <br>  I want more memory (or a card in the kit) - it is inexpensive, especially in bulk, and taking care of the details is always pleasant.  I want all sorts of covers and "second skin" to change the design to the mood (black - a universal color, but with personalization is not very). <br><br>  PS Here's a quick review.  A more detailed review of Highscreen Omega Q in the near future will be <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/users/alex_smartgadget/" class="user_link">laid</a> out by my friend <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/users/alex_smartgadget/" class="user_link">Alex_Smartgadget</a> And let this material be a brief excursion on the new model of the Highscreen brand :) By the way, he has a shovel released.  Nobody used it? </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/182410/">https://habr.com/ru/post/182410/</a></p>
