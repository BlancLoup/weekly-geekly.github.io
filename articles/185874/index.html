  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Master IT in the Skolkovo Institute of Science and Technology</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  This year I entered the magistracy of the <a href="http://www.skoltech.ru/">Skolkovo Institute of Science and Technology</a> , briefly Skoltech, in the direction of IT.  I will not write much about the university itself, as this information is on their website.  Let me just say that this is a new university, which will be the core of the Skolkovo Innovation Center.  The campus has not yet been built, but the university is already functioning and students are already being recruited.  Next, I ask under the cat. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h4>  Speaking of students </h4><br>  The first pilot set was recruited last year.  Then selected about 20 people.  Most of them went to MIT for a year, but some of the guys went for a year, for example, to Imperial College of London and to HKUST.  Now, the real first selection has passed and new students have appeared, including me.  And almost the full composition, we will learn with the guys from the pilot set.  Why "almost" I will explain a little bit later. <br><br><h4>  Dialing directions </h4><br>  There are no such faculties in the classical sense in Skoltech.  There are directions.  We were recruited by Information Science and Technology, Energy Science and Technology, Biomedical Science and Technology and Manufacturing and Product Realization.  Those enrolled in the last two will leave for a year at one of the foreign partner universities.  Nuclear Science and Technology and Space Science and Technology will appear in the next set, and I understand that those enrolled in these areas will also go for a year to one of the foreign partner universities.  That is, as soon as a new direction is opened, the years that have arrived at it are spent abroad.  I‚Äôll say at once that inside IT it is meant two directions so far, namely Information Technologies and Computational Mathematics.  A list of courses and their description can be found <a href="http://www.skoltech.ru/education/msc-programs/information-science-technology/courses">here</a> . <br><br><h4>  A little bit about yourself </h4><br>  I'll tell you a little about myself.  I graduated from the Faculty of Mathematics and Mechanics of Moscow State University, worked for a little more than one and a half years in the Department of Quality and Technical Audit in Beeline.  In other words, ensured that mobile communication at the switching level was decent.  I managed to study at the Yandex Interface Designer School and now I am writing my PhD thesis on dynamic routing at the Moscow Aviation Institute.  I am also a participant in the Open University Skolkovo program and even once managed to visit a working group at the Ministry of Communications and Mass Communications to develop a technical solution for MNP (Mobile Number Portability) in Russia as an expert.  I am a MSP (Microsoft Student Partner), a member of IEEE (this is, however, quite simple), and further on in trifles, I think that it is not worthwhile to detail my biography in this post.

    <h4>  Arrival </h4><br>  I will say just a few words why I decided that I wanted to go to the master's degree in IT at Skoltech and then move on to the most interesting part, that is, to the admission process.  I nevertheless graduated from a very fundamental department, and in life there was a great interest in IT, in particular, in computer networks.  And I decided that I want to fill the academic gaps in IT and learn.  In addition, due to the nature, it is easier for me to fill them in through the university, when I don‚Äôt have to think about work during the day, and in the evening I‚Äôm already tired of reading books. <br><br>  So, I will write about the process itself.  It consisted of two stages.  First was the correspondence stage.  This is a collection of different documents, motivational and recommendation letters.  The entire package is sent electronically through a special form.  Begin receiving documents in August, and the end - in January.  I decided to file closer to the end, because during the reception of the resume could be replenished, which it did.  After that, the full-time stage began.  Naturally, not everyone was invited to it.  About the criteria I can not say anything.  The full-time stage was held at Skolkovo Moscow School of Law (Moscow School of Management Skolkovo).  All broke into two streams, I got into the first.  The stage lasted three days.  On the first day I wrote an English test (TOEFL iTP), by the way, everything was in English and it is a working language in Skoltech.  In fact, the remaining two days were devoted to group assignments, and there was an interview at the end.  On each group task, each team was assigned observers from among the staff and teachers who looked at how each of us works in a group and individually.  I will give an example of one of these tasks.  They gave a set of resistors, a pair of batteries, tape, wires, scissors, a scarf and a multimeter.  It was necessary to collect an open circuit, which is closed with a multimeter and he had to show 2B.  Tasks in general were simple.  At the interview, there were mostly general questions from the category of telling about myself, why I entered and whether I was aware of the risk of entering a completely new university, as well as further plans for life.  Everything, it should be noted, was absolutely friendly and the atmosphere was amazing.  Unlike the excitement that you experience when you enroll in domestic universities.  After graduation, everyone goes home and waits for the results by email.  As you can guess, I received a positive answer to the question of my enrollment.  Some statistics: about 550 people submitted applications, 70 were invited to the on-site stage, and a little less than 50 received, including one student from MIT. <br><br><h4>  Impressions and what's next </h4><br>  From impressions I can say that I really liked it.  Both the selection process itself and communication with teaching and administrative staff.  I also want to note that the guys are quite interesting and there are many really very strong and talented people among them.  Before we start our studies, we will all fly away to the Innovation Workshop in August (you can read about the past for the pilot kit <a href="http://mitsloanexperts.mit.edu/luis-perez-breva-prototyping-technology-innovations-tinkering-reasoning-and-experimenting-innovation-is-a-process/">here</a> ) for three weeks at MIT.  I have already received a visa to the United States and now, in anticipation of departure, I am engaged in small paper affairs, such as participation in the double diploma program with MIPT and issuing a card to which the scholarship will be transferred (it will be enough not to work). <br><br>  I will be glad to answer questions. <br><br>  PS About the Workshop I can and I will write after it and I would like to know what questions about it are of interest. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/185874/">https://habr.com/ru/post/185874/</a></p>
