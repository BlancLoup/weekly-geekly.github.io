These were not empty disputes - for example, in some markets, only one of the two models was chosen for sale - the first impression of the ZL fades a little against the background of the ‚Äúsocket‚Äù: a glass symmetrical case and water resistance do their job.  But, having walked a bit with ZL (after the recent Xperia Z test), I changed my mind. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h4>  Design </h4><br>  The main advantage of a touchscreen smartphone and its key feature is always the screen.  The Xperia ZL screen occupies almost the entire area - 76% of its surface - due to the fact that the ZL is smaller in height and width than the Z, and the screen is the same - five inches with a resolution of 1920 √ó 1080.  This makes the Xperia ZL the most compact phone among the five-inch.

    <img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/cdb/9fe/321/cdb9fe3219c174bc2f53ac0455e942c3.jpg"><br><br>  The front camera is located in the lower corner of the case, which the phone specifically warns about when you first start. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/d0a/39e/725/d0a39e725399db106ba2d8567e606419.jpg"><br><br>  In the same place - the LED, whose color changes depending on the background color of the playing composition or the state of the phone (on charging, for example). <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/254/bb0/c92/254bb0c92e02d32ffb0c6a81174ba119.jpg"><br><br>  On the perimeter of the case - fiberglass inserts. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/759/249/cb0/759249cb0622965914217f7ac1fd8a41.jpg"><br><br>  Hard keys to adjust the volume, start the camera and lock the screen are located on the starboard side: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/f28/3f6/141/f283f6141a8120c1f86b02b9ae467dfa.jpg"><br><br>  On the left, only the MHL connector (microUSB and HDMI in one bottle) <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/26d/fa1/bd6/26dfa1bd6b52121ed6de90aa393557ec.jpg"><br><br>  Below - eyelet for strap <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/9bb/f9c/09d/9bbf9c09d10bd5f58c7e50e117998b27.jpg"><br><br>  On top - elegantly inscribed in the case of 3.5 mm audio connector. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/b28/fb4/968/b28fb4968ad9684ef9a025821d707b09.jpg"><br><br>  The back cover is convex, made of soft corrugated plastic.  The thickness of the phone with it reaches 9.8 mm. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/5c8/80f/2bb/5c880f2bbd5b8ccf33fef0fce014f71a.jpg"><br><br>  It is decorated with a camera eye. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/800/8d1/65d/8008d165d7512f4a29e7819141f0f970.jpg"><br><br>  Below - a hatch for access to a SIM-card and a microSD memory card. <br><br><img src="http://s3.uploads.ru/bHlyd.gif"><br><br>  In general, the Xperia ZL design is more relaxed, but no less successful than the Xperia Z. And details like the camera's eye, headphone jack and power button are nice to look at - they are from the world of jewelry and expensive watches: elegant, concise and expensive. <br><br><h4>  Ergonomics </h4><br>  Thanks to an unglamorous back cover made of rough soft-touch plastic, the smartphone fits into your hand like a glove.  It is more convenient to use open connectors - yes, it‚Äôs good bye for waterproofing, but now you don‚Äôt need to pick anything up to put your smartphone on charge.  The most controversial for me is the location of the power button in the center - many praise it, because  No need to reach for the upper edge of the device, it is convenient when the landscape orientation of the smartphone - but for me the button above is still more convenient.  The rest of the ergonomics Xperia ZL is almost perfect. <br><br><h4>  Iron </h4><br>  According to the measurement results, a quad-core 1.5 GHz Qualcomm APQ8064 processor and 2 GB of RAM provide amazing performance: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/e25/eb3/381/e25eb3381607f810c39577f3d49b4335.png"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/a75/1aa/79d/a751aa79d2d6f734e066f8529c5f9747.png"><br><br>  It turns out, Xperia ZL - one of the most productive smartphones on the market. <br><br><h4>  Soft </h4><br>  While on board ZL I found only Android 4.1.2, we are waiting for the update to 4.2 this summer.  Among the nice features of the system to which I noticed is the advanced features of the lock screen.  You can not only output the player to it, but also launch the camera from it: <br>  And the status bar, which is accessible even from the locked screen mode, allows you to switch to SMS, pictures, notifications from social networks and other almost instantly: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/ebe/3a9/34f/ebe3a934f8854f48931ec0752f20df1c.png"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/982/478/78d/98247878d851927ea60328e7d12867cb.png"><br><br>  Unlocks the screen by moving your finger up or down with a remarkable visual effect a la blinds <a href="">like on the Xperia Z.</a> <br><br><h4>  Camera </h4><br>  Using the camera has become more convenient thanks to the prompts what resolution the photo will have depending on the selected mode: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/ddf/e2e/54d/ddfe2e54da02387a6e84a35fdfd52bbd.png"><br><br>  I chose the minimum - 2 MP, i.e.  a picture of 1920x1080 pixels  for the web this is more than enough - while it takes up less space in memory, it is faster processed / loaded.  Nobody will print photos from a smartphone to a poster anyway, so there is no need for a 12 MP print resolution.  But for comparison - a couple of frames in the "everyday" and maximum resolution: <br><br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/a73/542/021/a73542021a3514333b281bb21819cb38.jpg" width="300" height="169"></a> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/ebd/333/19b/ebd33319b63bdf3e2d1447f39a24aca1.jpg" width="300" height="225"></a> <br><br>  Other photos taken are in the <a href="http://fotki.yandex.ru/users/egorkotkin/album/201019/">album on Yandex</a> . <br><br>  The camera starts almost instantly: one and a half seconds, even from the locked state.  The external camera button - large and convenient - also makes it easier to start.  By the way, quick start refers to the long-playing functions - say, on the one-year-old Xperia P the camera starts up as fast as the new one.  So the quick start of the deterioration of some functions over time does not apply. <br><br><h4>  Battery </h4><br>  Finally, I lived to see the day when the battery of a smartphone on Android I can call it a strong point.  The Sony Xperia ZL battery was a real surprise. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/89f/06b/8aa/89f06b8aad9fb5969bba500a0f85af42.png"><br><br>  In the energetic mode of operation, which includes listening to music, working 3G and regular outputs in the mail and facebook, at the screen brightness level of 30%, the smartphone eats 10% of the battery per hour.  In the area of ‚Äã‚Äãpoor coverage or when the screen brightness is increased, battery gluttony increases to 12-14% per hour, which still promises 7-8 hours of work. <br><br>  An hour and a half movie at maximum brightness, with headphones and wi-fi on (in fact, I just forgot to turn it off for the duration of the test) consumed exactly 25% of the battery.  Those.  Theoretically, the phone can play up to 6 hours of video on a single charge.  For me, this was a real surprise: I still remember the times when, when I tried to watch a TV series from my smartphone, the battery melted right before my eyes, at a rate of 1% per minute. <br><br><h4>  Equipment </h4><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/74e/963/a59/74e963a59d0a2d65993f37c6423744d1.jpg"><br><br>  In general, everything is standard: this charge got into a small box, a USB adapter and a MH-EX300AP headset. <br>  I already wrote a little about it in <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/sonyxperia/blog/172543/">the Sony Xperia Z review</a> , but let me remind those who missed everything - this is a special version of the <a href="">Sony DR-EX300iP</a> - expensive civilian headphones - with a built-in microphone and a call button.  The multifunction button: double-click rewinds the track in the player forward, triple - backward. <br>  Funny little thing: so that users are not confused in the dimensions of the rubber linings that come with the ‚Äúears‚Äù, they are provided with a kind of color coding: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/590/f4b/78d/590f4b78d3e9266adf763aaa3c984051.jpg"><br><br><h4>  Specifications </h4><br>  <b>Display:</b> 5-inch screen 1080 x 1920 Full HD Reality Display with Mobile BRAVIA Engine 2 technology <br>  <b>Weight and dimensions:</b> 131,6x69,3x9,8 mm and 151 grams <br>  <b>Processor:</b> Asynchronous quad-core Snapdragon S4 1.5 GHz <br>  <b>OS:</b> Android 4.1 (Jelly Bean) with the subsequent upgrade to 4.2. <br>  <b>Memory:</b> 2 GB RAM, internal flash memory - up to 16 GB, microSD support up to 32 GB <br>  <b>Camera:</b> 13 MPs with Exmor RS matrix for mobile devices, support for HDR video, Superior Auto mode and noise reduction, thanks to which it is possible to obtain crystal clear images and video in any conditions <br>  <b>Front camera:</b> 2 MP with Exmor R matrix <br>  <b>Battery:</b> 2330 mAh, Battery STAMINA mode, increasing the standby time at least 4 times <br><br><h4>  Summary </h4><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/052/6f1/330/0526f13300c7d402d7ec070b8b97f40f.png">  Design: harmonious appearance with nice details that you want to consider <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/052/6f1/330/0526f13300c7d402d7ec070b8b97f40f.png">  Battery: tablet longevity. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/052/6f1/330/0526f13300c7d402d7ec070b8b97f40f.png">  Performance: the best among smartphones according to the benchmark Vellamo (Qualcomm, Inc.) <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/052/6f1/330/0526f13300c7d402d7ec070b8b97f40f.png">  Convenient case - a conditional advantage, we are fair, compared with the Xperia Z: a ‚Äã‚Äãmore compact body and a release case back made of corrugated plastic make the ZL very ergonomic. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/052/6f1/330/0526f13300c7d402d7ec070b8b97f40f.png">  Price: Sony's official price tag on the ZL is 2500 rubles lower than the Xperia Z - only 27490 rubles. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/052/6f1/330/0526f13300c7d402d7ec070b8b97f40f.png">  Open connectors;  An additional plus is the combined HDMI and microUSB connector. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/052/6f1/330/0526f13300c7d402d7ec070b8b97f40f.png">  The lack of water resistance is a conditional flaw, as it is only in comparison with other Sony Xperia models. <br><br>  Paying tribute to the wow effect that the Xperia Z produces, I, nevertheless, have to state the following fact: in the aggregate of Xperia ZL parameters, it is simply the best among the large (5 inches) smartphone for every day of the existing ones.  Absolutely serious. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/177239/">https://habr.com/ru/post/177239/</a></p>
