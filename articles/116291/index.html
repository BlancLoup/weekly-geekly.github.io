  <section class="page js-page"><h1>10 facts about lemmings, which you did not even know</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Life is a shit thing.  At least, this is the opinion of many ‚Äúadults‚Äù people with whom I happened to communicate.  They constantly complain about their work, unsatisfactory relations and gibberish children, who in no way want to become what their parents want them to be.  Life for these people is an endless roundabout of disappointments, troubles and unfulfilled hopes.  They get up early in the morning with a sore head, pour a couple of liters of coffee into their mouths and go to work in a state that the most notorious zombies would envy.  They hate their jobs and believe that their activities are meaningless and no one needs them.  But in spite of this, with the stubbornness of the lemmings, they continue to do this work, day after day, year after year.  They break through their own lives, hoping that they will live happily later, when they have worked 10-20-30 years.  So, this is all garbage.  When you are fifty, you will be so tired of such a life that your only desire will be to lie down and die.  Yes, and health will not be the same, because you have merged it, doing all kinds of nonsense, to which you did not even care.  So, when you retire, you will not go to Africa to hunt lions, because the sun has a bad effect on your pressure.  You also will not go to the North Pole, because you have arthritis and cold - not the best medicine for it.  The South Pole is also no longer due to the fact that you dislike penguins, which is not surprising, given your 30-year experience as a sysadmin.  So what do you have left?  Trips to the country and evenings in the cozy company of the TV, that's what.  Having lived 30 years in constant struggle with yourself, you simply will not have the strength to tear your ass off the couch. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  And now think about it.  Do you really want such a life for yourself?  If you are not one of those strange people who enjoy their grief and insignificance, then the answer is likely to be "No."  But in that case, let me ask: what the fuck?  Why do you continue to cut circles on the same route, which ultimately leads you to degradation and self-destruction?  What are you waiting for?  Bloody fairy fairy that will bring you the elixir of happiness?  Sign over?  Then congratulations: the fact that you are reading this text now is such a sign.  God finally set aside a minute in his busy schedule to look at your worthless life.  And you know what?  He never likes what he sees.  But what‚Äôs really there, it seems to him that you are just an epic idiot who continues to torture himself and doesn‚Äôt do anything to change something in his life. <br><br>  Because this is exactly what life is about - change.  Look around: everything changes.  Trees grow, people are born and die, nuclear power plants explode ... So why are you stuck in an endless cycle?  Because change is not an easy thing.  It is much easier to sit in your comfort zone and blame the circumstances, God and the four-dimensional lizards.  In the end, because it is called a comfort zone: in it, you know, warm, light and flies do not bite.  However, you must understand one very simple thing: you have to pay for everything.  And in this case, the price will be your own life.  If you flush it down the toilet, there will be no second chance.  You will not respawn at the nearest cemetery and will not fall into some other world beyond the grave, where blondes with fourth size and endless stocks of beer will be waiting for you.  These things simply do not exist.  In fact, the afterworld is still the same idea of ‚Äã‚Äã‚Äúretirement‚Äù, brought to senility.  With the only difference that here "retirement" means death, and this, according to eyewitnesses, is not a very merry thing. <br><br>  So what's the point of all this verbiage, why am I crucifying here?  Life is a shit thing, and it will be just as shitty after you die.  Well, maybe a little more crap if you were a really nice guy.  It does not depend on you, and no matter how much you puff, you will not change life itself.  Children in Africa will still starve, and corrupt officials will buy yachts for your money.  All that you can change is your attitude to life, and to understand what is really important for you: day after day to break in unloved work with the ghostly perspective of abstract "pension", or something else.  You can at least try to change the course of your little piece of life and make it a little better.  I‚Äôm not urging you to get up from the table right now, give your boss a face, get drunk and wake up in the tundra with a bear.  All you have to do is look at your life through the eyes of another person.  Without fools, just take it and see if it is not you, but the neighbor Uncle Pasha.  If you have a feeling: ‚ÄúDamn, here is an idiot, then!‚Äù, Congratulations.  All that is left for you to do is start slowly making minor changes.  Close habr and go to bed at 11 pm to start.
