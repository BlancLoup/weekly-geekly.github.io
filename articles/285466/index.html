  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Male psychology in programming</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"><img src="http://dl.dropbox.com/u/7750825/hunter.jpg" alt="image"><br>  Programming employs many more men than women.  You can‚Äôt argue with this fact, so any manager must take into account the psychology of men in programming. <br><br>  Let us turn to the ancient times, when a man hunted mammoths, and women sat at home, gave birth to children and cooked food.  To hunt, a man prepared for a very long time, sharpened an ax, prepared arrows and a bow.  Then he sat in ambush for a long time and finally made a shot or struck.  This feature of behavior was transformed and lived to this day.  The man is distinguished by the ability to increase concentration on the work performed.  This is a big plus and a big minus.  Unlike a woman, a man cannot do several things at the same time. <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  From here follows the 1st conclusion: ensure that the programmer can be alone for a long time and not distract him from work. 
      <br>
        <script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>
        <ins class="adsbygoogle"
          style="display:block; text-align:center;"
          data-ad-layout="in-article"
          data-ad-format="fluid"
          data-ad-client="ca-pub-6974184241884155"
          data-ad-slot="8945601208"></ins>
        <script>
          (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
        </script>
      <br>
      After a long sitting, the hunter showed miracles of valor and courage.  2nd conclusion: ensure the possibility of recognizing the achievements of the programmer within the organization.  It is necessary to organize periodic gatherings where programmers will discuss technologies and show themselves in front of others. <br><br>  When a hunter shoots and misses, he is in for a serious disappointment.  The man takes any failures and censures to heart and is experiencing much more than a woman.  3rd conclusion.  No need to constantly tell the programmer that he is doing something wrong and wrong.  If you want to point out a mistake, do not do it in public. <br><br>  As a result of the psychology of long preparation for the shot, the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãthe waterfall principle of project management was born.  Smart people instead of the waterfall process came up with Agile techniques that provide for the release of the product in a more frequent way.  If it takes too long to prepare, the mammoth will run away. <br>  4th conclusion: do not stretch too much product release periods. <br>  5th conclusion: do not immediately make the product too difficult, increase the complexity gradually. <br><br>  Because of the innate ability to concentrate, often a novice programmer cannot organize himself and cope when he is given several tasks at the same time, or the task is not clearly formulated. <br>  6th conclusion.  Let the programmer specific tasks, organize tasks in the accounting system tasks. <br><br>  Another feature of male thinking, which clearly does not follow from the example of a mammoth, is that a man knows the world through action.  Psychologists have long noticed such a feature in boys and came to the conclusion that boys of preschool age and in primary school practically do not learn what they are told.  Only when he performs an action, then they know the subject.  It turns out that our education system does not take into account male psychology, but this is a separate topic of conversation, but for now the 7th conclusion.  Teach programmers through practice.  You can organize lectures on programming, but only by doing some specific tasks, programmers will learn how to do their work. <br><br>  Do not think that the opposite rules should be applied to women.  If from A follows B, then this does not mean that not from A follows not B. <br><br>  Those who wish to familiarize themselves with this topic in detail can read the publications by N.Yu. Erofeyeva. <br>  For example, regarding child psychology, ‚ÄúUnusual in the ordinary, unusual in the familiar ... About boys.‚Äù I‚Äôm just warning you that this book is not on the Internet. <br><br>  UPDATE.  Interestingly enough, in the course of discussing the article, her rating first fell below zero, and now with a considerable advantage in the plus. <br>  Here is what I would like to say to those who disagree: no need to think that every article should have strictly grounded scientific evidence.  This article has a different genre, and scientific research is not a habr format.  It is very strange to meet the comments that this is complete nonsense, along with comments that these are all obvious facts. <br>  As, Niels Bohr said, the opposite of a correct utterance is a false utterance.  But the opposite of deep truth can be another deep truth.  If the article causes such heated debate, it means that the thought in this article refers to the latter. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/285466/">https://habr.com/ru/post/285466/</a></p>
