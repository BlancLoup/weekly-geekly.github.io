      We are talking about the project (it was already mentioned a <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/search/%3Fq%3Dsocialware">couple of times</a> in Habr√©), which is dedicated to social engineering.  And this does not mean at all that the Owl (as the participants of the project call themselves, <b>So</b> cial <b>Wa</b> re) educates throwers and fraudsters, by no means, with all forces fights with them, and sometimes punishes them. <br>  <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/users/m0hze/" class="user_link">Back in</a> 2008, the domain soc-engineer.ru was registered as a friend under the nickname m0Hze.  A few months before, the authors of the project Vasya aka <b>GoodGod were</b> actively working with him in the direction of ‚Äúunraveling‚Äù the mailboxes and got a good hand.  Having decided that this topic will be interesting not only for them, I actually think for a long time that a forum has been created.  The site itself was not.  They discussed psychological chips, deception, NLP and others. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  After a while, the project (forum) began to develop, a logo was invented, new sections were added, and so on.  Immediately, a ‚Äúprivate‚Äù was created - a hidden section that is not accessible to mere mortals - it includes some active users.  At that time, there was nothing particularly there and simply discussed various topics that were not in public, subjects for the video. <br>  The idea to create a project lurked long ago, after the first books on social engineering and social hackers.  The team members tried a lot, basically all the methods work to this day and to be honest I‚Äôm sure they will work in 2012 and in 2050. They survived a lot, arrests, courts, reckless resistance to security systems of various sites, companies, etc.  But about it we will hide. <br><br><h4>  Care in private </h4><br>  Users registered, the project expanded a little, and then unexpectedly a complaint was filed against the forum, allegedly they did not have a license.  Naturally she was absent;) Only after that they decided to hide from everyone and go in private.  After that, all users were deleted and only the most active, creative and sensible remained, and the topics in private are more interesting.  After that, the project moved to a new domain, which is still on today. <br>  The users were different - programmers, designers, hackers, psychologists, who were united by one idea.  Gathering the right people who are interested in this subject, the guys started to create.  They tried to shoot videos, wrote articles, performed and invented tasks for training in real life.  On the site itself there was a section ToolZ, in which there were unique programs and creaks for a social engineer, but at the peak of activity .... <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/a62/a38/df2/a62a38df220948a36783a325a4cc73bc.png" alt="image"><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/465/58f/d03/46558fd03c727ab5ec46bc04fe7504ea.png" alt="image"><br><h5>  on the abyss of the abyss or end of Old SW [Wednesday, November 17, 2010] </h5><br><br>  In such communities, there will definitely be enemies.  If the forum experienced DDoS attacks, then the WordPress engine that was not newly updated (it was the main site on it) was hacked, and the forum dump was laid out, so the end of the Old SW era came. <br><br>  After some time, the forum again earned.  From scratch.  Some users left, but new, no less interesting ones came in return, and just a few days ago the site‚Äôs main page appeared (a year passed, only the forum existed, and the main page was empty), which means that the project is gaining new strength.  In my turn, I will follow the project, because it seemed far from a standard forum to me, it is something more.  Say hello to the team!  We are waiting for new videos, articles, work. <br>  And below are the most interesting: <br><h6>  Mass domain hijacking </h6><br><iframe src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://player.vimeo.com/video/8638486&amp;xid=17259,15700002,15700021,15700186,15700191,15700253,15700256,15700259&amp;usg=ALkJrhjvtLXMM8joe0xXUgUgClWoqsPJHw" width="525" height="315" frameborder="0" title="Mass hijacking of domains by Goodgod and morty10" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br><h6>  Under the guise of a journalist, we entice licenses from Agnitum. </h6><br><iframe width="420" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/N3GrjJdg2T0%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700002,15700021,15700186,15700191,15700253,15700256,15700259&amp;usg=ALkJrhjsZ1prBuNKNtN1h_9tIvY2hQeZWQ" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  How to capture security.vkontakte.ru <br><iframe src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://player.vimeo.com/video/10642239&amp;xid=17259,15700002,15700021,15700186,15700191,15700253,15700256,15700259&amp;usg=ALkJrhixuetny1iaTk4sdrOjPDgifRCnzw" width="525" height="315" frameborder="0" title="Hacking security.vkontakte.ru" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br><h6>  Hacking hacker site Hackersoft.ru.
