  <section class="page js-page"><h1>About great patriots</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  An amazing mentality among the Slavic peoples: disunity and inability to act when necessary, and rampant courage in hindsight and at a great distance from the conflict.  When you need to do something, they hide in the corners, embarrassedly sniffing and turning their eyes away - they say, this does not concern me.  Chronic terpily incapable of active actions.  Some kind of stirring begins only after the family kills half of the relatives, and the other half is raped or otherwise omitted. <br><br>  Judging on this from personal experience.  The company in which I was in military service numbered about 100 soldiers and sergeants — conscripts like me.  The main part of the unit (80 percent) consisted of “Slavic brothers”, 10 people were representatives of the Caucasus region, 10 more people came from the Central Asian republics of the Soviet Union.  The bulk of the soldiers of Slavic nationalities almost meekly tolerated harassment from the "chocks" - this is how Russian-speaking conscripts (by the way, Soviet personnel officers too), proud of their high Slavic intellectual potential, called Caucasians and Asians.  Despite the fact that there were very few of them, the “chocks” always and everywhere acted as a single whole, defending the interests of any of their fellow tribesmen as a whole.  “Brothers-Slavs” in most cases preferred not to notice cases of bullying “brothers” - no one shouted “Ours are beaten!” And did not rush to the attack.  “Every man for himself” and “maybe blow over” are the basic principles of the army service of a Russian-speaking conscript soldier.  These principles were strictly observed during two years of service - despite the absolute numerical superiority of the “Slav brothers” over the “chocks”.  Such is the Slavic tradition - my hut on the edge. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  1989  Chisinau is the capital of the Moldavian SSR.  On the central city street, across the roadway, having stalled the traffic, 15 to 20 freaks-nationalists walk like a liquid chain and shout: “Russians - get out of Moldova!  Suitcase!  Railway station!  Russia! ”Around - hundreds of citizens, mostly our“ Slavic brothers ”- they stomp on their business, hiding their eyes from each other and pretending that they do not notice anything.  My hut on the edge.  Maybe blow over ... <br><br>  May 1990.  Again the city of Chisinau.  In Pushkin's park, next to the monument to Moldavian gospodar Stefan, the Popular Front activists slowly kill the boy, student Dima Matyushin, who, returning from a concert of Dieter Bohlen, met the Popular Front and could not answer them in Romanian.  Many citizens, "brothers-Slavs", pass by and pretend not to notice anything.  My hut on the edge ...

      Approximately also events developed in Latvia and other Baltic republics.  The same thing happened in Georgia and the Caucasus.  My hut on the edge.  Maybe blow over! <br><br>  Not carried by.  How it ended up (did it end?), We know. <br><br>  Now about another feature of the character of the representatives of the “great-power” and, as we have already found out, the “united” Slavic people - about the manifestations of “courage” and “strength of spirit” in those cases when there is nothing for it.  Waving your hands at a distance from the fight, and then punching yourself in the chest - they say, here I am, the hero of the Russian land - it's so cool, right? <br><br>  We will not be so strict with all the representatives of the Slavic nations, let's talk only about its most active part - about the youth: about those young citizens who will soon form the backbone of a great power awakening from the fetters;  about those who build states and revive the national identity of the Slavic peoples. <br><br>  Young people, as we know, are very advanced now and most of the young “Slav brothers” (by the way, sisters too) spend a lot of time on the Internet, with the help of which they are trying to revive a great-power self-consciousness, and at the same time they assert themselves. <br><br>  For example, flashed in the media a <a href="http://azakharov.ru/2008/11/20/nagrada/">message about the act of a Latvian girl seller</a> who refused to speak to a client in Russian - and right there our advanced youth <a href="http://smi2.ru/Vulkan/c74991/">began to indulge their great-power ego</a> , practicing in wit and knowledge with the idiom of the great and mighty Russian language. <br><br>  Or, another thing - the Russian company GFI <a href="http://www.gfi.su/index1.php%3Flangid%3D1%26idt%3D1098%26categ_id%3D%26menu_id%3D5%26page%3Din_devel">announced the imminent release of the computer game “Coercion to Peace”</a> , according to the scenario of which the Russian troops would continue to “wet down” Georgia, and right there appeared great-power comments on the Web: “Let's go fucking Tbilisi”! <br><br>  What unrestrained courage!  What a beautiful patriotic impulses!  You do not find? <br><br>  Ate seriously - what will happen next?  What will we come to?  Is this outright stupidity, this empty chatter can be called a rebirth of national identity?  What are we going to do when we need to unite and join the fight (forgive me for pomp) for a just cause?  Averting eyes, whispering in the corners and entertaining pride with “bold” witty comments on numerous forums and blogs? <br><br>  Who will build the "great Russia"?  Our young Internet patriots?  Do not make me laugh!  The gut is thin ... Yes, we will go far away.  However, already arrived.  Sailed. <br><br>  PS I have no doubt that this article will cause a “great patriotic” (in a large number of those who have learned from this resource and never learned to think with their head) a desire to put on me the minuses and with a sense of accomplishment to continue to indulge their great-autocratic pride.  But still, I ask: at least for a while, turn on the brains and give a reasoned answer - <a href="http://azakharov.ru/2008/11/30/priplyli/">and what, in fact, am I wrong</a> ? <br><br>  Ay, brothers-Slavs! <br><br>  <b>Upd</b> : <b>As I expected, brave great-power patriots amicably amused me, and now I cannot leave comments on the topic.</b>  <b>If anyone has a desire to convey something to me, write here: <a href="http://azakharov.ru/2008/11/30/priplyli/">http://azakharov.ru/2008/11/30/priplyli/</a> - do not consider it an advertisement.</b> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/45830/">https://habr.com/ru/post/45830/</a></p>
