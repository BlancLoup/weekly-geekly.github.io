  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Lenses are good</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  According to the survey <a href="http://sasha237.habrahabr.ru/blog/61635/">"Do you wear glasses or contact lenses?"</a> 53% of respondents have good eyesight.  What is surprising, because most habra people spend a lot of time at the computer, because of work, study, or just for rest.  If you enter these 53%, then this article is hardly useful for you; if not, I advise you to read it. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h4>  Little misconceptions </h4><br>  <b>Lens may impair vision</b> <br>  This is one of the most frequent and dangerous delusions.  The lenses themselves cannot impair vision.  The lenses only help to focus the rays of light exactly on the retina, helping to achieve the desired visual acuity.  From the points are different in that they are directly on the eye. <br>  <b>Lenses are like glasses.</b>  <b>Wear and wear!</b> <br>  For lenses, unlike glasses, need constant care.  Moreover, there are no eternal lenses.  They differ in service life, but more on that later. <br>  <b>The lenses of the eyes are more susceptible to infections.</b> <br>  If you use one-day lenses, it is almost impossible to infect the eye with something.  Lenses of longer wear must be processed according to instructions, then dirt will not get into them and the chance of infection will be close to zero. <br><br><h4>  About lenses </h4><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/ccc/ce8/97b/cccce897b6a98bc4bcaf20f785887515.gif" alt="image"><br>  So, you decided to buy lenses.  What to choose? <br>  Lenses are different.  I broke them into several classifications. <br>  <b>By material</b> <br>  <i>Hard</i> made of solid materials, self-preserving curvature.  Used for the correction of astigmatism to a large extent. <br>  <i>Soft</i> are made from polymers, are used more often and are more comfortable than hard ones. <br>  <b>By the time of wearing</b> <br>  <i>One</i> - <i>day</i> - the most comfortable.  In the morning I wore it, in the evening I took it off and threw it away.  No hassle with solutions. <br>  <i>Planned replacement lenses</i> are a compromise between price and eye comfort.  The term of wearing from 1 week to 3 months.  Such lenses need to be treated with a special solution.  For eyes, they are better than traditional ones.  Used by most people, both in Russia and abroad. <br>  <i>Traditional lenses</i> are the best price.  The term of wearing is from six months.  Also need treatment solution. <br>  <i>Prolonged lenses</i> - you can even sleep in such.  They are made of silicone and hydrogel, which is why they are called silicone hydrogel.  However, there are pitfalls.  The pleasure of sleeping in lenses is quite expensive.  Solution treatment is also required. <br>  <b>To destination</b> <br>  <i>Optical</i> - the most popular.  Used for vision correction for myopia, hyperopia, astigmatism. <br>  <i>Cosmetic</i> - for the correction of various congenital or acquired defects of the eye as a result of injury. <br>  <i>Decorative</i> - they do not improve vision, they change the color of the eyes.  They are divided into tint (only light eyes change shade), changing eye color (suitable for any eyes, give any desired color) and Crazy lenses (you can apply any logo on them, for example, Habra and walk in them). <br><br>  Here are examples of crazy lenses. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/98d/145/d9c/98d145d9cfb97e2a754eeb0a3ef2046c.jpg" alt="image"><br>  There are other characteristics of lenses that are equally important.  They also need to know when choosing a lens. <br>  <b>Moisture</b> content - water content in the lens.  Measured in%.  The more - the more comfortable.  There are low hydrophilic lenses (moisture content up to 50%) and high hydrophilic lenses (more than 50%). <br>  The first cheaper, less torn and long-accumulated protein deposits (less chance to pick up the infection).  The latter are more comfortable for the eyes, they can be worn longer (although it is recommended not more than 12-15 hours). <br>  <b>Oxygen</b> permeability <b>(DKL)</b> is an indicator of oxygen permeability.  The higher the better for health.

    <h4>  About prices </h4><br>  Before buying lenses I advise you to make a diagnosis. <br>  It can be done from 0 (for example, in the local clinic, which I really do not advise) up to 2,000 rubles.  Price, on average, for Peter - 500 rubles. <br>  The average cost of a pair of silicone hydrogel lenses for a month is 500 rubles, just hydrogel will cost about 250. Well, the coolest, one-day costs about 1000-1200 rubles. <br>  Colored lenses can be purchased for 700-800 rubles. <br><br><h4>  Conclusion </h4><br>  Although in Russia the lenses are not so in demand (0.03% of the total population use lenses), as, say, in the USA (15%), everyone can afford the lenses.  They are not as dangerous as they are described and are very easy to handle.  For those who want to see better, lenses are the perfect solution. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/67611/">https://habr.com/ru/post/67611/</a></p>
