  <section class="page js-page"><h1>"I do not minus" or the value of diversity</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  MVC originated in Smalltalk, gained strength in Java, and was picked up by RoR developers, who threw out all unnecessary, inventing Convention over Configuration, after which MVC spread out on a multitude of technologies and became very popular.  In turn, CoC and the simplicity of working with dynamic languages ‚Äã‚Äãlike PHP, Ruby, Python could change the look of a bureaucratic machine like Sun: now they also strive for simplicity and it becomes more convenient to program in Java every day. <br><br>  There are a lot of such examples: * nix, OOP, AOP, ORM, version control, refactoring, unit testing, continuous integration, flexible development methods, language improvements, web 2.0, iPhone, computers themselves, science, and practically everything originates on the basis of it affects something.  Good ideas wander from head to head, develop, improve and lead to the creation of new good ideas. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a>  Situation: you have learned that a mudflow is about to collapse on the city and all those who are not evacuated will die.  You run down the street and see a bar full of people.  Run there and report this news.  It turns out that this is a sports bar and the audience watching football.  They slowly turn their heads, stand up, come up to you, cut down from the elbow, kick for a long time and return to viewing.

      Do you like the best?  Yes.  Fans lost?  Yes. <br><br>  Ok, more specifically.  Now Habr is a lot like this bar.  Someone just scared to go into it.  Someone has already gone and got a head, so the second time will not work.  Someone at all prefers to stay away from him.  Who loses from this?  We all.  Many excellent articles are unpublished, many opinions are unspoken.  I know what I'm talking about - among such people there are many of my friends and acquaintances who have something to say.  The same opinion can often be found on the net. <br><br>  Meanwhile, a well-known fact - differences in culture, past, attitudes, approaches, and environment strongly contribute to the creation of great ideas.  For example, Steve Jobs and Google hire a lot of very strange people and introduce them into working groups.  Yes, and you yourself, for sure, felt that the greatest growth occurs when you are faced with a task that you did not solve before, when you switch to a new job or a new project.  People with different views are not enemies, but friends, as they allow you to grow and learn something new if you are open to it. <br><br>  I propose to try to make Habr more tolerant of alternative opinions for which I accept for myself and I suggest that everyone accept the following rule: <br><br>  <b>I do not minus habratopiki, habrakommenti and habrayuzerov, if my opinion does not coincide with the expressed.</b>  <b>Instead, I state my reasoned opinion and listen to the arguments of my opponent, especially if my arguments are not sufficiently substantiated.</b>  <b>If the habrayuser really does not understand something, then I make an effort to bring it to him, but I don‚Äôt put a minus on any outcome.</b> <br><br>  In other words, I propose to use the minus mechanism only for filtering really bad content (stolen, non-thematic, upyachkovidnogo, but not just uninteresting to you), punishments for rudeness and other antisocial acts. <br><br>  Friends, you do not beat the face of your friends, if you do not agree with them.  Let's do the same here.  Pressing a minus is simple, but learn to control your disgusting tsarist ambitions.  You would not want to be impaled? <br><br>  And no, it's not about karma.  It's all about the attitude.  It is not very pleasant to be in a community that, instead of open discussions, prefers to quietly shit and slip away. <br><br>  Always open to any contact and I hope for understanding.  Thank. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/45960/">https://habr.com/ru/post/45960/</a></p>
