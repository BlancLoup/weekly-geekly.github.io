  <section class="page js-page"><h1>The fate of Linux in schools. Personal opinion of the teacher.</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Good day.  Over a year has already passed from the memorable speech of Dmitry A. Medvedev on the transfer of Schools to a free software product.  The mechanisms of the state machine began to spin as usual and the process began ... But, as always, apart from real life.  THOSE.  Funds, corporations, information resources are being created, but schools do not know about them, and thank God. <br>  Of course there are results.  And the main positive result can be called, if not strange, the activation of MS in the Russian segment.  An enormous amount of work was done on localizing and promoting MS products, very liberal licenses were created and distributed, and there was a competent propaganda of MS solutions.  And, in general, if we exclude various semi-corruption schemes of promotion, all this activity deserves respect and praise.  For example, the Russified Visual Studio made me doubt the usual ‚ÄúMS - Mazda‚Äù.  And, most likely, the Russification was done with an eye to education - the professionals will prefer the English interface. <br>  What about Linux? <a name="habracut"></a><br>  First of all, Alt-Linux should be confidently ahead of competitors in the fight at the state feeders.  My first acquaintance and first disappointment in Linux is connected with this company.  The second way too.  And since the distance between them is about 5 years, then I decided on the third experiment only after I learned that the project ‚ÄúSTRS for Schools‚Äù was supervised by this company.  The result is the same.  Of course, I downloaded the younger version for the weakest computers, but the design is generally below any criticism, with all the discounts on my hardware.  This is not even the embodiment of the thesis ‚ÄúLinux is a sad crap‚Äù, this is its apotheosis.  The acquaintance begins with a huge rectangle placed on the screen for inputting a login and password.  Design zero, color scheme disgusting (IMHO).  Of course, older versions with KDE should be better, but than to make the system an BAD system for weak machines, it‚Äôs better to refuse to support them altogether.  The student is oriented not at the functionality, but at the interface.  And scaring him once in the second roll does not lure. <br>  Mandriva is my long attachment.  Qualified product.  Support for education in Russia, as I understand it, was taken over by enthusiasts.  And successful. <br>  Ubuntu  It is presented in the Russian segment by two companies. <br>  For a long time I could not install it because of the default installation method - via Live-SD.  I have iron, I repeat, weak.  Especially since the original design did not particularly impressed me.  But the solution from Infra-Linux with an alternative boot allowed me to reconsider my opinion.  The design is stunning (in my unprofessional and not very spoiled look).  But at work, the system did not become on more powerful machines than at my home ‚Äî it simply did not boot from the CD and that‚Äôs all. <br>  On this, my acquaintance with Linux systems is limited, but let me conclude on this modest basis that schools will not accept Linux.  Why? <br>  Schools formally (according to the curriculum) are interested in 2 things. <br>  1. High-quality office package for the subject "Information Technology". <br>  2. Pascal / BASIC programming system to choose from.  With a quality development environment.  (For the subject of Informatics). <br>  This is quite enough, and Linux and Windows can provide it all. <br>  But in order to force teachers to switch from a familiar environment to another, it is necessary to offer a decent alternative.  + a lot of literature + approximate lesson planning, lecture notes, etc., etc., etc. Otherwise, just after the Free Computer Assistance deadline, money will be collected from the parent committee, Akademik will buy a license and everything will go along the groove. <br>  In general, in order to overcome the inertia you need an impulse.  But I still do not see the prerequisites for such an Impulse. <br>  From the discussion, I expect that someone will convince me <br>  This is the first.  And second, I want to offer a solution, but for now I‚Äôm shy, as you probably understand, and I don‚Äôt have enough experience and status in Linux. <br>  PS Habr is already one, and I, not an IT specialist, feel not comfortable in it.  So if something goes wrong, please do not judge strictly.  I just want to hear a discussion of this problem from the experts. </div>
