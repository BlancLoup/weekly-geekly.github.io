There are dozens of video instructions for finishing and other works: primer, putty, painting with decorative plaster, installation of partitions from blocks, laying floorboard, fugovka, wiring electricians, installation of lamps and sockets - anything you like.  Theoretically, you can build a whole house from YouTube videos!  Although ... why theoretically?  A large single mother from Arkansas has proven that it can be done by anyone without any prior training.  For nine months, she independently (with the help of children) <a href="http://www.cbsnews.com/news/mother-of-four-cara-brookins-builds-her-family-a-house-by-watching-youtube-tutorials/">built a whole house according to video instructions from YouTube</a> . <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  There are a lot of step-by-step instructions on the construction of houses alone on your own on the Internet: for example, see the epic thread <a href="https://www.yaplakal.com/forum46/topic655903.html">My House-Garage in Moscow</a> , where the topstarter described in detail the steps of converting an ordinary garage into a comfortable two-story house. <br><br>  Such projects can be found a lot on the Internet.  Many are confused by the lack of experience in construction.  Some believe that only men should be involved in construction.  The American <a href="https://twitter.com/cmbrookins">woman Cara Brookins set</a> an example that in the Internet era all the necessary information can be obtained and the dream can become a reality.  Even a mom with many children.

It is logical that in the development of the project she applied the usual computer technology.  True, she and the children had to work very hard, but they managed. <br><br><div class="oembed"><twitter-widget class="twitter-tweet twitter-tweet-rendered" id="twitter-widget-0" style="position: static; visibility: visible; display: block; transform: rotate(0deg); width: 500px; margin: 10px auto; max-width: 100%; min-width: 220px;" data-tweet-id="820835813978243076"></twitter-widget><script async="" src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div><br>  Kara's last marriage was unsuccessful: her husband began to suffer from full-blown paranoid schizophrenia, using violence against his wife and children.  Even after the divorce, he continued to appear and threaten the family.  The woman had nowhere to go, left with four children, who in 2008 were 17, 15, 11 and 2 years old.  She decided that the only way out would be to move to another safe place.  But she did not have the money to buy comfortable accommodation for such a large family.  So she moved from the house where she lived with her husband to a tiny house near the town of Little Rock (Arkansas).  And there once happened an event that was a real revelation for Kara. <br><br>  Driving once past a dwelling destroyed by a hurricane, the woman paid attention to how the house is arranged - the foundation, partitions, and rectangular cells of the rooms.  For the intelligence of a computer analyst, this has become a revelation - is it really that simple? <br><br>  Cara thought that such a house could be restored on its own.  Or even build from scratch.  So began this project.  It turned out that there is enough money to buy land and the necessary building materials.  A woman with children did this - and threw herself headlong into this unknown work for herself.  After the purchase of building materials, there was no money left.  Construction teams in the United States earn <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3DLufWRYCdmWk">at least $ 10 per hour for each person</a> , the family has not drawn such expenses.  The first instruction on the mixing of cement mortar Kara found on YouTube. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/31b/9bc/b38/31b9bcb3863630ce8277f82a36588950.jpg"><br><br>  Then YouTube became its main source of all information, although in 2008 there wasn‚Äôt nearly as many valuable video instructions and specialized DIY channels for building houses as it is now. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/b70/02f/070/b7002f0703064eeba429171c21ca87ff.jpg"><br><br>  But even then the information was enough.  Kara says that each work can be done in different ways, so that she watched three or four videos before filling the foundation or installing windows in order to understand the best algorithm and method of doing the work.  All the children helped, except for the two-year-old Roman, who only climbed through the mud at the construction site - but also participated in the common cause. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/79c/6e8/b1c/79c6e8b1cb71471aa0a78247d1fb47df.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/2e2/478/ba4/2e2478ba405c409597acb5e9ca230db5.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/e93/79d/947/e9379d9470e745008f51e5db9aa02589.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/006/ab7/ef7/006ab7ef767a4701834e30465c6151ff.jpg"><br><br>  The project took nine months and demanded very serious efforts.  The woman with the children did everything with her own hands: from pouring the foundation to laying the walls and, reportedly, even laying a gas pipeline.  This is hard to believe, because some work is allowed to be done only by licensed professionals.  True, to save money, you can do everything yourself and call a professional only for inspection, it will be so much cheaper. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/433/7a5/962/4337a5962126f13daf692e318bb88b38.jpg"><br>  <i>One of Kara‚Äôs daughters works like a plasterer.</i> <br><br>  Mom of four children said that physically the work was difficult, but every day the children became stronger - due to natural growth and training. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/bb1/ede/c46/bb1edec460444fe3a3fce404dc3de5d3.jpg"><br><br>  For nine months, the whole family had only work - construction, no rest, cinema, dates and so on.  It was very hard, but Kara says that there is a positive side: the work rallied the whole family together and made them more friendly than ever.  According to her, she was most afraid that teenage children one day would wake up in the morning and start whining: ‚ÄúNo, I will not do it anymore.‚Äù  Nothing like this happened.  Kara then even wrote a <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Rise-How-House-Built-Family/dp/1250095662">book</a> about how working together unites a family. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/-GqLfEIuNHs" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br>  Some people think that the Internet has turned into a big social network for idle talk and does not fulfill its initial tasks - sharing knowledge and disseminating valuable information.  However, from time to time there is evidence that not everything is lost for mankind, and some people know how to use the Internet for its intended purpose - to gain knowledge.  For example, there are many <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/post/247893/">channels for learning web programming</a> .  If you want to learn something, there is all the necessary information on the Internet for this.  What can I say, even if robots are <a href="https://geektimes.ru/post/245162/">trained on videos from YouTube</a> . </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/370125/">https://habr.com/ru/post/370125/</a></p>
