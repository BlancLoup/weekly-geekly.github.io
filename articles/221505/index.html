Now I‚Äôll tell you just the enchanting story of buying a camera, in which everything is fine - from rude operators, delivery without sale documents and to couriers selling documents. <br><br>  So, it all began with the call of conditionally accessible stores: there were about a dozen of them.

    <h4>  Hole 8-800 </h4><br>  Several stores have an answering machine for 8-800 - this is a good hole to attack the budget overflow.  Vulnerability has long been described - competitors can make a bot four-second calls to the number of 8-800, and, without waiting for a live operator, hang up.  The owner pays for 800 (store), so at the end of the month in this situation a large bill can arrive.  I‚Äôm pretty sure that a competent admin will keep track of such situations - but I‚Äôm not sure if he has small shops.  Actually, we ourselves learned about it from the topic on Habr√© and immediately closed the hole. <br>  <b>Check out yours.</b> <a name="habracut"></a><br><br><h4>  Electronic currencies </h4><br>  Less than a dozen of the 50 stores accept WM / Poison, of which only two are worth more than 15.000.  Of these, one works "blindly", simply asking to transfer funds to the R-wallet account.  However, not all give the data to the Market - this means that if a person is eager to pay with electronic currencies, he may simply not find a store. <br><br>  <b>Useful info: if you take poison - do not forget to give this data to the Market.</b> <br><br><h4>  Abandoned basket and vulnerability PD </h4><br>  Utinet managed to call an hour after the goods placed in the basket, with the words "You place an order."  ‚ÄúNo,‚Äù I say, ‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt make out.‚Äù  "No, have issued."  I do not like when such things are decided for me.  It seems like, sorted out.  I also wondered if they had the right to process my PD without consent.  Prostestil offer - yes, exactly, only after the order.  Accordingly, I asked the operator not to process my PDs anymore. <br><br>  After 15 minutes, they also received an SMS about the fact that I have a discount of 500 rubles.  <abbr title="Who buys in Yutinet - take it on board, they have the mechanics of processing an abandoned basket.">Do not buy anything at once</abbr> .  The second call to KC immediately after the SMS went more fun - they tried to turn my phrase about ‚Äústop processing personal data‚Äù into ‚Äúunsubscribe from the mailing list‚Äù.  Nevertheless, I insisted on the first.  To their credit - it seems, well. <br><br>  <b>Take care of your PD - some use them and despite the agreement.</b>  <b>For me personally, this is still one of the main reasons to go shopping instead of ordering deliveries.</b> <br><br><h4>  Hello!  Technical support? </h4><br>  Beautiful girl Maria of one more store managed to get nasty with me for not having received the password from her personal account - it‚Äôs my fault that I‚Äôm personally guilty that my idiotic gmail doesn‚Äôt accept their letters.  And the letter is not from the registration, nor from the form of recovery.  Well done, what.  The prize went to another store, the review fell on J.Market. <br><br>  <b>Experience: the operator should be able to recover the password to the client (or give access to his account) directly from his interface.</b>  <b>As an option, change mail to work.</b> <br><br><h4>  Rostest </h4><br>  Those stores that sell Rostest for some reason forget to write about it right on the product page in the description.  A couple of times there were comments like ‚ÄúIs this Rostest?‚Äù Hanging for weeks without an answer. <br><br>  <b>You sell something that can be imported ‚Äúgray‚Äù or tampered with - write that this is the original, and how to specifically distinguish it from counterfeit.</b> <br><br><h4>  Reality dance </h4><br>  Another store works with Yandex.Market furiously - when switching from Market, the price for my position is one, and when cleaning cookies (old memory after flight sites) - already higher by 8 thousand rubles.  Great plan.  Sometimes in the same scenario, the price is lower, but rarely. <br><br>  <b>It is useful to check such things.</b> <br><br><h4>  Promo code </h4><br>  Another one of the stores in the basket had a form for inserting a promo code.  Short googling showed that there are promotional words, and in general - are available.  It can offend ordinary users (‚ÄúPromo code is asked, but I don‚Äôt‚Äù). <br><br>  <b>Correctly together with the promotional code, explain that you need to enter it in the note to the order, and not to create a special field.</b> <br><br><h4>  When will the courier arrive? </h4><br>  6 stores did not know their delivery time.  To achieve certainty without the ‚Äúearliest‚Äù, ‚Äúfrom‚Äù, ‚Äúmost likely‚Äù, ‚Äúif brought to the warehouse tomorrow‚Äù and other phrases failed.  So, at the earliest, most likely, from Thursday, if brought to the warehouse tomorrow.  Wait for the call of our courier service in 3-4 days, they will tell you more precisely.  Another cool moment is when the site was marked on Tuesday, the operator said, ‚Äúwill arrive on Thursday, not earlier, set for Thursday,‚Äù and on Wednesday came the SMS ‚ÄúYour delivery was postponed on Thursday‚Äù with apologies. <br><br>  <b>Operators should be in close contact with couriers and be responsible for each other.</b> <br><br><h4>  Out! </h4><br>  Shops with fast delivery did not always report this explicitly. <br><br>  <b>This is an advantage.</b>  <b>It should be shown directly on the product page when it will be at the buyer.</b> <br><br><h4>  Payment </h4><br>  Three stores hid payment methods until recently - it turned out to be found only in the basket when sending an order. <br><br>  <b>It is necessary to clearly and clearly write the order of payment and delivery - right down the steps so that the buyer understands everything and calms down.</b> <br><br><h4>  Pre-sale </h4><br>  Only one store tried to sell before the sale - I was quite intrusively offered to buy a memory card, a slot for which is simply not in the camera.  By the way, earlier Yulmart, who was bought on the advice of their own consultant in the offline DVI cable store together with the monitor (instead of a suitable HDMI slot), was abruptly noted earlier for a long time. <br><br>  <b>Good to do smart after-sales.</b>  <b>For example, unobtrusively ask when confirming whether a second battery is needed.</b> <br><br><h4>  Descriptions </h4><br>  Most of the stores used the same description of the camera, written immediately after the release.  Digging in previous models showed that the situation there is the same - that is, in an attempt to compare the model of 2013 and 2010, both will be ‚Äúnewest‚Äù with ‚Äúmost modern sensors‚Äù and ‚Äúfast processors‚Äù, for example. <br><br>  <b>Write your descriptions.</b> <br><br>  No store advised similar products more expensive (directly).  For Canon, this is painful - for example, I only understood in an hour what happened in three years between the flagships of their one-bit lines. <br><br>  <b>‚ÄúBut the same one, only iron, with a larger screen and 2 times faster‚Äù - a good jump from a three-digit model to a two-digit one at the end of the description.</b>  <b>Roughly speaking.</b> <br><br><h4>  Call further </h4><br>  A good find was ‚ÄúIf you want to talk to the management, press 0 during the conversation.‚Äù  True, I tried 3 or 4 times (why there is so much - a little further, there is a whole epic), but every time I got on the IVR chipper about "everyone is busy, call back later, farewell."  The idea is awesome, the implementation is not very. <br><br>  A very good thing was ‚ÄúTo improve the quality of service, conversations with specialists are recorded.  If you do not want your conversation to be recorded, press 2. ‚Äù  This is the official Canon customer service in Europe. <br><br><h4>  Reviews </h4><br>  The store, the operator of which I got nasty, was immediately honored with the star of the hero with overlap on the back in Yandex.Market.  After 5 days, their manager called me, said that they had fired the operator and offered some ‚Äúmoral compensation‚Äù to choose from in the form of some accessory.  In general, everything was fine, except for the fact that I felt like a person who is being tried to bribe for deleting a review.  If they immediately said - excuse me, cant, here's a flash drive or filter for any next order - no question, I would probably become their regular customer.  And so - politely sent.  But the fact that someone is working with reviews is already good. <br><br>  We have, by the way, reviews understood within 24 hours.  Six months ago, we were slower, and therefore often suffered from the actions of delivery services in other cities (not ours).  It is clear that shoals happen to everyone, and it is clear that the buyer absolutely do not care who doed it - he took the goods from us. <br><br>  So, now we have learned to solve these rare problems almost immediately.  The difference is this: if the goods are crumpled on the road, and delivery is today for the afternoon, it is bad.  You can do nothing.  And you can immediately understand this and call the customer at 11, describe the problem and propose a solution - either deliver with mint packaging, but urgently (sometimes it is necessary, for example, before the holiday: from us - free delivery), or postpone delivery already normal for tomorrow (from us - again - free shipping).  The person does not wait in vain and fully controls the situation. <br><br><h4>  And now the epic </h4><br>  So, the camera is ordered and paid.  The courier arrives, brings the device.  I check - ok (a couple of years ago in the Player they tried to sell used as new, for example).  And then the extravaganza begins, because Canon's original guarantee is empty.  And I already had to hammer in the shop to me - I gave the money by prepayment.  The quality department does not get through, the head of the call center does not pick up the phone, the PR manager does not respond to the letters.  They offered to come to the office, because "the courier can lose documents."  I put the ticket and honestly waited a week.  At the same time, an extravaganza was revealed in IT - for example, ‚Äúyour order was canceled because the courier product is not in stock‚Äù ‚Äîand inconsistencies fell one after the other.  Then I got tired, and I wrote to the founder.  In a magical way, a courier with a guarantee arrived at the door the next morning.  But not the family, and the store.  Finite <br><br>  If we talk about us, Mosigre, then we too kosyachy.  Actually, you often on Habr√© write about it to me, for example.  But there is a moment: we disassemble every joint, change processes and include it in training. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/221505/">https://habr.com/ru/post/221505/</a></p>
