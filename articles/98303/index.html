  <section class="page js-page"><h1>PlayerOK</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  There is such a player as <b>iAudio 9</b> - it‚Äôs strange that I‚Äôm writing about it just now, because I went with it last summer, when modelka only slanted on the Russian market.  Then I worked at Just, where I had a separate small room with a semi-gloss white table and a white board in the background ... then I photographed exclusively in JPG ... oh, there were times) At about the same time I sketched the text, but everything was lost and forgotten - I dug out against the background of a recent review. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/6f2/ea4/4ca/6f2ea44ca9d9058ad0e32ded5d6f59e0.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  So today, no balconies or loggias - just a table and bare walls. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  To begin with, I don‚Äôt know for certain what is the connection between Cowon and iAudio, but apparently this is the same thing, or the second is the brand of the first.  No matter how it was there, this time the player is called <b>iAudio 9</b> and it came, it seems, to replace the 7th model.  If you tilt the PMP device away from the company, you can roughly position the position of the device in the model range - this is not yet a shuffle-like <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/hardware/75434/">Cowon E2</a> (‚Äúkeychain‚Äù without a screen), but also not an ‚Äúovergrown‚Äù <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/hardware/72322/">Cowon S9</a> , which easily gets and with music and with video.  This time the golden center is a compact player with a small display.  The model is interesting primarily because it is relatively inexpensive, but for this price it offers a traditional company device.

    <h2>  Inbox </h2><br>  Once again, I would like to mention the company's approach to creating a packaging device in which the player is mounted on a special runway.  This time it‚Äôs not just some kind of box ... it‚Äôs a special conical container made of transparent plastic in which you can plant a plant after removing the device!  In any case, on the stand icons drawn instruction.  It is a pity that the set did not have seeds, land and a bottle of water for irrigation ... otherwise, the need to plant a tree hasn‚Äôt been canceled yet) In any case, I love these little things and it seems to me that they deserve a small plus sign. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/eaf/acb/0e4/eafacb0e44d253cc734380fe49d93a93.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/9d3/574/d81/9d3574d81d1fa25ed051e38af2499543.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/ec1/bb7/15c/ec1bb715c444041e841dfc227ca85140.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  The package bundle is more than modest - the player itself, a CD with software, headphones for the first time, a USB cable and paper instructions. <br><br><h2>  Appearance </h2><br>  The player has nothing to do with all previous devices - a kind of step forward and aside for the company, because this time the player is very beautiful. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/31e/90f/0d0/31e90f0d0835b4db302e9a17c9738d5a.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  It is very compact (43x95x8.9 mm and weighs 40 grams) - it can easily fit in even the smallest hand, be it an adult hairy man, a fragile girl, or a school child. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/3d0/13d/ccc/3d013dcccde2525e112bf6283ade9e09.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  More precisely, even the player is not so much small as thin - I had to get used to this for about a day or even two.  At least, to press the button on the end, sometimes you had to get the player out of your pocket - it is not an easy thing.  What can we say about the microscopic switch - the easiest way with him is when you hold the player with your second hand. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/0ad/99a/968/0ad99a96890f6a86ede4ba63f4bf19ee.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/5b9/eaa/f68/5b9eaaf680fc5a07e73c9e4f550a01ca.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  The case is made of matte plastic and there are several colors to choose from - I had a black one. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/0fc/ae4/d9f/0fcae4d9feb62cd698aa321d5b1d7d92.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Almost the entire front side is occupied by a glossy (brand) glass insert, behind which approximately a third of the area is occupied by a bright screen (2.0 '', 320x240, TFT LCD, 262 thousand colors), but it is not touch-sensitive - a third touchscreen is provided for control.  Even lower is the speaker - surprised that with its size it is relatively loud, although the quality is very mediocre. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/702/f4d/44c/702f4d44c1d715baa180dd1281dc55c1.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/68c/db4/bdc/68cdb4bdc4ef030aa6ebbeb137bb7129.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Top empty, bottom - headphone jack, microUSB-port and a hole for the strap. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/b81/27d/2ba/b8127d2ba004d1188889488303de61df.jpg" alt="image"><br>  <i>Photo taken from the <a href="http://hi-tech.mail.ru/review/item/1841/">review</a> on Mail.ru</i> <br><br>  On the right is a lever for power management and locking, as well as a button to go to the main menu. <br><br>  On the left side are conveniently located buttons for volume control and a microphone. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/b89/021/84c/b8902184c783a2547b7fd941b063adcc.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  On the right is a menu button and a ‚Äúlever‚Äù to lock and lock the device (s). <br><br>  In contrast, for example, from the recent <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/hardware/98117/">V5</a> , in which the screen was located primarily for video, and only then for music ... here everything is the opposite - the main task is to play music, and everything else is just a bonus, for a tick. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/eab/65c/2de/eab65c2deadff768089e4929e18f7349.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  We get a barrel organ. <br><br><h2>  Turn on and work </h2><br>  The player turns on very quickly - the main menu immediately appears on the screen, consisting of several icons.  All of them are very standard for this type of player, so I will not particularly stop.  Let me just say that, as before, the main sharpening is here to the music, so everything else is just a bonus, which can be useful only for a small percentage of owners. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/b16/6fb/620/b166fb6203a92b673895994c899b0f8d.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  As I said, the company likes to experiment with the interface - in all the devices that I used to use, it was different.  Not an exception, and iAudio 9 - an unusual, but quite attractive shell.  The menu in it is located diagonally, and since the screen is not touch-sensitive, it is necessary to move through all the points sequentially - to do this, you need to slide your finger across the touch strip.  The next experiment from the company, which seemed to me not very successful - it takes more time to go to the menu, it is easy to miss, and sometimes you really want to poke your finger on the screen (and at first I repeatedly poked out of habit).  Of course, you can get used to it ... but it doesn‚Äôt compare with the convenience of S9 <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/bcf/c4c/4d3/bcfc4c4d3baab4cb51ac8498d04da0e2.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Beautiful icons, easy to read text.  Since it was not possible to make screenshots of the screen directly in the system, only pictures remained.  I will show a couple for a general presentation.  See the rest in the video below. <br><br>  Music&gt; Video&gt; Photo&gt; Documents&gt; Radio&gt; Voice recorder&gt; Settings. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/bdf/283/c7c/bdf283c7c12cd3981c137d5c7fedbe78.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  The screen resolution can be ‚Äúhigh‚Äù, but the physical size of the screen itself is very small in our time - to read, watch videos and photos from it ... well, you understand.  However, there is support for files in AVI, WMV, ASF (Xvid SP / ASP, WMV 7/8/9; MPEG1 Layer 1/2/3, WMA), JPG, TXT, LDB and SMI formats.  It may be useful to someone, but I used music exclusively. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/030/f7d/e7d/030f7de7d24cf95b87f2d454e58144fe.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  And with the music there is a complete order - from the traditionally chic sound, to just a good list of supported files (see the specifications below).  There was a place for the radio, which (really!) Works (with the possibility of recording) without headphones, i.e.  through the built-in antenna!  But also a speaker on board ... <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/ab6/2cc/07d/ab62cc07de221d40865518412efa5c6e.jpg" alt="image"><br>  <i>Photo taken from the <a href="http://hi-tech.mail.ru/review/item/1841/">review</a> on Mail.ru</i> <br><br>  The player has a fairly advanced system for working with music files - there are many ways to sort them, be it artists, genres, and so on.  Opening any file, it starts playing, and the album cover appears (if registered in tags) on the screen.  And if you go up a level, then thumbnails of the albums of the other tracks in the folder will appear on the screen.  Swiping between them takes place again sequentially, from screen to screen - sometimes with a finger on the touch panel one had to solidly poelozit. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/cd1/3ee/ac8/cd13eeac8bcd6292b9a7dc267864ee8c.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/407/3f7/e3d/4073f7e3dddd44f71612ffb05d7a58ad.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Thanks to the touch area under the screen, you can flush the track to the desired position or go to the track menu.  In this case, the composition can be added to favorites or bookmarks, you can adjust the settings of the preset equalizer or do something else - all functions are again located diagonally on the ‚Äúchessboard‚Äù board.  And despite the seeming primitiveness of the interface, it inherits almost all that is in the "adult" players - whether it is the same equalizer settings or a huge number of different options.  So, for example, what is the cost of setting up the order of reproduction: looping a track or folder, playing a category (!), The next (!) Folder after completing the current one (or stopping after the end of the folder), separately into all folders ... very cool!  And, by the way, there is also a bonus for audiobooks - you can bookmark. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/62b/be1/ff4/62bbe1ff49b98dda066e59749c97fbdd.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  In fact, I don‚Äôt really want to describe in detail the sound of this player.  Not because it doesn‚Äôt deserve it - not at all, the sound quality is as always at a height ... it‚Äôs just hard to choose adjectives other than ‚Äúloud, high-quality‚Äù, etc.) Otherwise, the sound quality is extremely close with the Cowon S9, about which I already wrote before.  If you can find some minor differences, then you cannot do without a microscope ... in the sense of lossless music and headphones of the highest class and most importantly, understanding ears.  At least I have problems with the latter and in my unbalanced hearing, the hero of the review simply does not have any differences from the multimedia S-ki.  As if the same romance sings all the same singer, but located only in a more compact body. <br>  Well, I will add that the player easily gives all the musical directions - from hard rock to melodic "air" melodies.  Everything is good in general) Naturally, if you change the squalid regular headphones for something more worthwhile. <br><br>  Unlike WinCE, which was used in some PMP models and where it was possible to install different software, everything is becoming stricter - the proprietary platform doesn‚Äôt go too far.  But you can reflash - since I gave the player, three new firmwares have been released - the volume of the change lists is not amazing, but everything that has to be ‚Äúpolished‚Äù.  Yes, and what else to expect from such a crumb, if initially almost everything was? <br><br><iframe width="420" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/KXy19sYlCBQ%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700023,15700186,15700190,15700253,15700256,15700259&amp;usg=ALkJrhi8YN0nqPFAblDciytyi2n2Y5p-5g" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  The manufacturer‚Äôs work time is somewhat overestimated - I‚Äôm not going to mention exact numbers in practice, but the player doesn‚Äôt play for 30 hours - 22-25 maximum.  Although there are many different criteria - the brightness of the screen and the frequency of its use, the bitrate, that-that ... But there was no such thing that I drove and the music suddenly stopped - if you keep the battery icon in focus, the player will not fail. <br><br>  Pleasantly surprised by the speed of work when connected to a computer: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/59d/7fe/30d/59d7fe30ded17d050fb708e60278a8a2.png" alt="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/a9c/f6d/810/a9cf6d8100d85c2a5c145ca304dce9c3.png" alt="image"><br><br><h2><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/af2/94a/228/af294a2281f2c106ec7aac2f877a8602.png" alt="image">  Check weighing </h2><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/881/117/ccb/881117ccbc836c685868fb19a2bf46c1.png" alt="+">  A hint of "green" technology in the package) <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/881/117/ccb/881117ccbc836c685868fb19a2bf46c1.png" alt="+">  Full-featured player, many settings <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/881/117/ccb/881117ccbc836c685868fb19a2bf46c1.png" alt="+">  Built-in antenna and external speaker <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/881/117/ccb/881117ccbc836c685868fb19a2bf46c1.png" alt="+">  Tiny size and light weight <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/881/117/ccb/881117ccbc836c685868fb19a2bf46c1.png" alt="+">  Sound! <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/881/117/ccb/881117ccbc836c685868fb19a2bf46c1.png" alt="+">  Price <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/24f/0ae/920/24f0ae920b085ead2e6d649649177122.png" alt="-">  Glossy front side <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/24f/0ae/920/24f0ae920b085ead2e6d649649177122.png" alt="-">  The screen is not touch that will require addiction <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/24f/0ae/920/24f0ae920b085ead2e6d649649177122.png" alt="-">  Not the most convenient management <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/24f/0ae/920/24f0ae920b085ead2e6d649649177122.png" alt="-">  No memory card support <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/24f/0ae/920/24f0ae920b085ead2e6d649649177122.png" alt="-">  Few hardware buttons <br><br>  The battery life did not dare to add to the pros or cons - on the one hand, for a device with a screen of 20-25 hours it is not bad, on the other hand - I wanted the same feats that D2 / S9 is capable of. <br><br>  With prices everything is fine - the 4GB version costs 4,000, 8GB - 5,000, and 16GB - 7,000 rubles.
