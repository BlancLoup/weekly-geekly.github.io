  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Service Desk - quick start. 1 part. Defining the purpose of implementing the Service Desk</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Today I begin a small series of articles "service desk - quick start." <br><br>  In the cycle it is planned to describe your own experience and give recommendations on how to build the Service Desk system in the company from scratch, based on the ITIL methodology.  The introduction of a module for handling incidents, appeals and asset accounting is considered.  Other modules in this course of the articles are not considered. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/77f/cb7/07c/77fcb707c3df43c29f5311506f81be87.png"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  It is understood that the reader is at least superficially familiar with the basics of the methodology, but does not yet have practical experience of implementation.  The article may be of interest to IT managers, senior IT professionals, entrepreneurs. <br>  The cycle is planned to include the following articles: <br><ul><li>  Definition of the purpose of implementation of the Service Desk, strategic advantages. </li><li>  Creating a service catalog. </li><li>  Creating a single window, single entry point. </li><li>  Asset accounting. </li><li>  SLA. </li></ul><br>  ITIL is a library describing the best practices used in practice for organizing the work of departments or companies engaged in the provision of information technology services. <br>  These are not ready-made solutions, but only a set of general rules on the basis of which you can build your Service Desk, which will be unique for your company. <br><br>  The very first question you need to ask yourself: for what purpose do you implement the Service Desk system?  And do you need it? <br>  If you are a business owner, then it will depend on your answer whether the system is implemented or not.

      If you are an IT manager, or a senior IT specialist, then the answer to this question will determine whether you will promote this system to the owners or not. <br><br>  When is the Service Desk system necessary?  It seems to me easier to answer when you can do without it - in small companies, with the number of jobs less than 100, located in one location with the number of IT staff not more than 2-3 people. <br><br>  As soon as your company outgrows these volumes, the number of requests increases and the following questions start to the IT department: <br><ul><li>  Why did you forget about my request? </li><li>  When will you finally do what I asked for? </li><li>  Why does a computer / internet / printer, etc., work so badly (substitute the required one) </li><li>  What do these parasites do in the IT department?  etc. </li></ul><br><br>  If such questions begin to appear, then the business becomes dissatisfied with the quality of work of the IT department. <br><br>  What does the introduction of Service Desk: <br><ul><li>  Lets understand what's going on in principle.  How often these or other users turn, how often this or that equipment breaks down, how well these or other services are provided. </li><li>  Based on the information obtained above, you can draw conclusions about weak points.  And not necessarily the problem may be in the technique.  Sometimes it's enough just to remake the interface of the program, and the number of hits is reduced by half. </li><li>  Gives you the opportunity to plan as the development of IT infrastructure, and the planned update, prevention, and p. </li><li>  Gives the opportunity to justify a decision in numbers.  ‚ÄúThe computer‚Äôs chief accountant often breaks down‚Äù is not an argument.  ‚ÄúOver the past six months, a public accountant broke down the computer 4 times, which led to 20 hours of downtime for this specialist,‚Äù this is a more weighty argument for making this or that decision. </li></ul><br><br>  Service Desk will help you in the first stage to answer the question - what exactly does the IT department do.  Is everything as bad as the users describe or are they trying to cover up their laziness / incompetence with problems with IT equipment? <br><br>  If everything is really bad, then, with the above statistics, the IT department can answer what can be done to change the situation.  And then the business will have to understand whether it is ready to invest the amounts announced to achieve the requested level of service or not. <br><br>  And this is where the formation of the SLA begins and the specification of the service catalog, where the business measures its desires with its capabilities. <br>  After this comes the third stage, when the business ensures that it receives the desired in exchange for its funds. <br><br>  When negotiating with a business, it is important to remember - business thinks in terms of money.  He is not interested in technical terms.  Within the framework of the ITIL concept, a business acquires a service, not equipment.  If the problem sounds - 1C Accounting often does not work, then the business is not interested in either the server device or the cause of breakdowns.  He is only interested in how much it will cost to fix it and how much money will be lost if it is not repaired. <br><br>  The implemented Service Desk system allows you to abstract from specific calls and observe general trends, identifying unobvious connections and finding the root causes of problems.  And as a result, to deal with the problem, not the consequences. <br><br>  If you have a Service Desk, then you will be able to explain what is happening to you, what problems you have, how to fix them, the cost of eliminating and the cost of risk if you don‚Äôt eliminate it. <br><br>  The most important and most difficult thing is that a business should be set up for dialogue.  If there is no trust in the IT department, then your calculations about the need to replace equipment, investing in infrastructure, hiring specialists will simply not be believed and will be forced to solve all problems solely with available resources. <br><br>  If you did decide to implement the Service Desk, then be prepared for an increase in overhead costs for the execution of applications.  Now it is not enough for the technician to pull the jammed paper out of the printer.  He must register the application, classify it, make a comment, and only then close it.  Business should understand this and be ready for such expenses.  Especially in the first time, while the system is only being introduced and driven around. <br><br>  PS <br>  The process model can be used not only when building an IT service, but also in any other department.  This will allow a better understanding of the functions of the department, its workload and will improve the control over the work of staff. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/294244/">https://habr.com/ru/post/294244/</a></p>
