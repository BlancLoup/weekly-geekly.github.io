  <section class="page js-page"><h1>We read the news correctly. Skype will not ban in Russia</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  On July 22, 2009, the whole RuNet spread around the <a href="http://www.securitylab.ru/news/382828.php">news</a> that Megaphone calls for banning skype in Russia (here are links to this topic only on Habr√©: <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/telecom/65036/">1</a> , <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/telecom/65044/">2</a> , <a href="http://mtr.habrahabr.ru/blog/65234/">3</a> ).  A huge number of users erupted in this regard with righteous anger against Mr. Yermakov as a representative of Megafon and other cellular network operators.  The reaction can be understood, but the question is - were they justified? <br><br>  Let's analyze the news point by point and try to figure out where the facts are in it, and where our conjectures are with you and the incompetence of journalists. <br><br>  For the original news, I will take the text of the <a href="http://www.securitylab.ru/news/382828.php">first</a> link given, with the undoubtedly authoritative resource <a href="http://www.securitylab.ru/">www.securitylab.ru</a>

      <b>UPD1: I</b> strongly advise you to read the record to the end.  Snatching a few paragraphs from the long (what to do) text, you are unlikely to understand the basic idea. <br>  <b>UPD2:</b> thanks for the karma, moved to <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/i_am_clever/">"I - smart</a> . <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/i_am_clever/">"</a> <br>  <b>UPD3: the</b> topic was moved by the moderators to the blog <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/telecom/">"Telecoms"</a> . <br>  <b>UPD4:</b> in the comments it turned out that initially the news <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/telecom/65036/">appeared</a> on Habr√©.  published without indicating the source by the user <a href="http://geektimes.ru/users/goodlark/" class="user_link">goodlark</a> (it is in the comments to this entry). <br>  <b>UPD5:</b> found <a href="http://www.thinkit.ru/blog/viewblog/908">news</a> in one place.  there is a podcast, but the text is read by a robot, take care of the brain! <br>  <b>UPD6:</b> user <a href="http://geektimes.ru/users/gorbarsky/" class="user_link">gorbarsky</a> found indirect confirmation about the planned PR action. <br>  Megaphone is the first in the list of clients of the <a href="http://snetwork.ru/">Social Networks</a> agency, which was quite capable of publishing the discussed news with the hands of the same <a href="http://geektimes.ru/users/goodlark/" class="user_link">goodlark</a> .  according to him, the forums have already started creeping newcomers to the praises of the Multi-Phone, which is apparently also included in the package of services of this agency. <br>  <b>UPD7:</b> there was another <a href="http://www.content-review.com/articles/10611/">link</a> on the topic, I hope that the latter. <br>  <b>UPD8:</b> <a href="http://www.rspp.ru/Default.aspx%3FCatalogId%3D283%26d_no%3D6626">news</a> on the site RSPP. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a>  Let's start with the headline news: <br><blockquote>  <b>Skype can ban.</b> </blockquote><br><h5>  what can I say?  the news headline itself is surprisingly short, but at the same time in the style of the yellow press.  why not say who will ban?  Where?  for now let us postpone these questions ... </h5><br>  first paragraph: <br><blockquote>  Yesterday the meeting of the RSPP Commission on Telecommunications and Information Technologies was held.  On the agenda was a discussion of the prospects for IP telephony in Russia ... </blockquote><br>  <b>... a discussion of the prospects for IP telephony in Russia ...</b> <br><h5>  everything seems fine, right?  are going to discuss prospects, what's the ban skype? .. </h5><br>  second paragraph: <br><blockquote>  Valery Yermakov, First Deputy General Director of OJSC Megafon, made a report, in which he clearly disliked IP-telephony as a phenomenon.  The words ‚Äúcannibalize traffic‚Äù, ‚Äúparasitize‚Äù were heard.  Yermakov and his colleagues or, rather, competitors from other companies, are not very happy that IP-telephony operators use the existing infrastructure for their enrichment, and network owners do not get anything from this.  Megafon does not want to accept the subscription fee and the cost of traffic. </blockquote><br>  <b>... "dislike of IP telephony" ... "cannibalizes traffic" ... "parasitizes" ...</b> <br><h5>  sounds unpleasant for us (as simple consumers in the mass) phrases.  we are all adults and therefore we decide that Mr. Yermakov wants to turn the listener against SIP. <br>  but at the same time, we rank ourselves and these listeners, which in turn leads to a wrong perception of the subsequent information. </h5><br>  <b>... IP-telephony operators use the existing infrastructure ... the subscription fee and the cost of traffic in the calculation of "Megaphone" does not want to take ...</b> <br><h5>  two sensible but unconditional mercantile thoughts.  I will leave an assessment of these thoughts on the conscience of every reader (bearing in mind the incorrect positioning of myself as a listener), but let me remind you one phrase from the well-known anecdote: ‚ÄúGena, let me carry a suitcase, and you me?‚Äù </h5><br>  from the third to the sixth paragraphs there are numbers that are unimportant in themselves for the perception of information, but in general they additionally set us up against the ‚Äúgreedy‚Äù operators. <br><br>  Scroll further, the seventh paragraph: <br><blockquote>  Ermakov sees two ways to solve problems that have arisen for operators with the development of IP-telephony: <br><br>  - protect investments and fight VoIP-services; <br>  - provide similar services. </blockquote><br>  <b>... protect ... provide similar services ...</b> <br><h5>  our fears multiplied by the headline of the news begin to surface.  ‚ÄúProtect‚Äù is equivalent to ‚Äúprohibit‚Äù, the initiative of operators to provide their own services in general passes by the backyard of the central brain, perceived as something flawed. </h5><br>  By the way, here is a <a href="http://www.3dnews.ru/software-news/_megaskaip_ot_megafona/">link</a> to the news about the SIP-service from Megafon.  You will not believe it, but the news dates from the same July 27th of this year!  ( <b>upd!</b> messed up with dates: the initially discussed news appeared on July 21 on Habr√©, without specifying the source, then on July 22 on the lab, and (sic!) again without specifying the source. And the SIP news from MegaFon - 27.07) In the service description : <br><ul><li>  MTS and VimpelCom users can download the software and connect to the authorization server (only computer-to-computer calls are available) </li><li>  for calls in the direction of PC-&gt; phone, the metropolitan branch of MegaFon plans to charge - either as per the user's ‚Äúhome‚Äù tariff or slightly less </li></ul><br>  excerpt from the news: <br>  " <i><b>... Most likely, in MegaFon it was reasonable to assume that fighting with VoIP and SIP solutions is useless (especially by acting prohibitive measures on 3G networks) ...</b></i> " <br><br>  <b>note:</b> another journalist is another presentation of information ... <br><br>  but back to the news on securitylab.  eighth paragraph, the interim conclusion of the author's news: <br><blockquote>  It is clear that for users the second way is the most attractive.  But, unfortunately, it‚Äôs not a fact that in the event that operators start providing similar services, this competition will be fair.  There is a big risk that Skype will simply be banned in Russia.  And this will surely happen if Skype does not connect to SORM (telephone tapping system). </blockquote><br>  <b>... Skype ... will be banned in Russia ... if Skype does not connect to SORM ...</b> <br><h5>  where does this conclusion come from?  where does this information come from?  read on ... </h5><br>  ninth paragraph, the outcome: <br><blockquote>  In his report, Yermakov focuses precisely on the fact that now the voice will pass through channels uncontrolled by the state.  And by 2010, according to some calculations, 40% of the traffic will pass through IP telephony operators.  Also, operators very much hope to draw the attention of officials to the fact that Skype earns money in Russia and does not pay taxes here, it does not invest in infrastructure.  And users, according to Yermakov, should be wary of service providers who are not officially represented in Russia, their activities are not controlled, therefore the interests of subscribers are not protected. </blockquote><br>  <b>... now the voice will pass through channels uncontrolled by the state ...</b> <br><h5>  firstly, a funny typo, it is clear that the author of the news did not know what he really wanted to say, but we will not quibble. <br>  secondly, what channels are we talking about?  about the channels of the ISP / PPSOS level or about the skype protocol itself?  it is obvious that about the protocol, the ISP / PPSOS are somehow controlled, and this is a fact. </h5><br>  <b>... by 2010, according to some calculations, 40% of the traffic will pass through IP telephony operators ...</b> <br><h5>  There is no doubt that such calculations are, it is unlikely that Mr. Yermakov or his subordinates will take the numbers from the ceiling.  but did the 40% surprise you?  According to how such estimates this figure in just one year can soar to such heights?  I will answer - according to estimates of the traffic that will go through the 3G networks of mobile operators.  where do such bright prospects come from?  There is an answer to this, here's the news from 03/30/2009: <a href="http://www.webplanet.ru/news/soft/2009/03/30/skype_iphone.html">‚ÄúSkype will launch an iPhone-client for iPhone‚Äù</a> ... again, it‚Äôs no secret that for other mobile platforms, customers also already exist. </h5><br>  <b>... according to Yermakov, service providers who are not officially represented in Russia should be wary ...</b> <br><h5>  No, Mr. Yermakov, you will not deceive us!  - we think together with the journalist. </h5><br>  tenth paragraph, it's time to think: <br><blockquote>  As a result, at the last meeting, the RSPP Commission on Telecom and IT decided to create a working group that would propose measures to improve the regulatory legal framework. </blockquote><br>  <b>... measures to improve the regulatory framework ...</b> <br><h5>  Of course, we are talking about banning skype all over Russia!  - we have no doubt about this ‚Äúfact‚Äù. </h5><br>  in the eleventh paragraph is another personal conclusion of the author's news: <br><blockquote>  The main legislative problem is that calls between fixed phones and SIP are not regulated at all.  However, it‚Äôs not a fact that the measures proposed by Megafon with TTC will be in the hands of users.  Operators are afraid of competition and strive to keep their sources of income, to leave things as they are.  Therefore, the risk that Skype will still close is very great. </blockquote><br>  <b>... the risk that Skype ... will close is very large ...</b> <br><h5>  trust but check.  This rule should be attributed not only to our authorities and corporations, but also to any other incoming information. </h5><br><br><h4>  Let's think ... </h4><br>  Why did we decide that we are talking about the ban on the use of skype throughout Russia?  Personally, when I first read the news, the phrase that SIP traffic will increase to 40% and that skype is not connected to SORM has finished it.  Indeed, after these words, it is believed that the government will take such a desperate and difficult step as banning the whole protocol in runet.  But if you think a bit, read the security links offered by the securitylab ( <a href="http://www.securitylab.ru/bitrix/exturl.php%3Fgoto%3D%252Fnews%252F382547.php">‚ÄúIsrael forbade operators to block Skype‚Äù</a> , <a href="http://www.securitylab.ru/bitrix/exturl.php%3Fgoto%3D%252Fnews%252F376947.php">‚ÄúDeutsche Telekom will block Skype‚Äù</a> , <a href="http://www.securitylab.ru/bitrix/exturl.php%3Fgoto%3D%252Fnews%252F368743.php">‚ÄúEuropean authorities want to listen on Skype‚Äù</a> , <b>upd:</b> found <a href="http://www.webplanet.ru/news/telecom/2009/04/03/skypesoangry.html">‚ÄúMobile operators will block Skype‚Äù</a> ) then, in my opinion, it becomes obvious that: <br><br>  <b>1.</b> There is nothing terrible (surprising, unusual - pick a word that suits you more) in that the authorities want to listen to the conversations of citizens in the manner prescribed by law.  A discussion of what to listen to can, regardless of legality, be better left to other news. <br><br>  <b>2. The</b> conversation at the meeting was exclusively about the ‚Äúpermission‚Äù of the EPOS, in law, to prohibit the traffic of third-party VoIP-providers in 3G networks.  This is indirectly indicated by the above link about Israel.  As far as I understand, now no one from the PEPOSs can legally prohibit the use of skype in 3G. <br><br>  <b>3.</b> After the creation of a legislative base for such measures of PEPOS, skype will again be of no interest to anyone, including those working with SORM, maybe no 40% will be seen closely even after 5 years.  In connection, the main thing is mobility, and for the time being only cellular operators can provide it.  There is of course such a cool word as WiMax, but for now I wouldn‚Äôt be in a hurry to talk about it as a real competitor to EPOSOS. <br><br>  <b>PS</b> : be careful on the Internet, and take care of yourself. <br>  <b>PPS</b> : I am not an insider of the POEPOS, although I once worked in this area :) but perhaps this fact helps me to look at them less biased and first try to understand the claims against them. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/65478/">https://habr.com/ru/post/65478/</a></p>
