  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Microsoft returns money to Call of Duty: Infinite Warfare customers in the Windows Store</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/4f9/73a/030/4f973a0304fa6a59ab053c3b0621cf22.jpg"><br>  <em>In the version of the game for the Windows Store online only two players</em> <br><br>  New parts of Call of Duty, as in the Battlefield competitor franchise, are released almost every year.  Product Activision differs in that the emphasis in it is not only on the network game, but there is also an interesting single-player campaign. <br><br>  A number of customers of the new Call of Duty in the integrated Windows Store have encountered an unexpected problem: their versions of the game do not have access to Steam servers and are transferred to separate servers.  And to enjoy the network game is possible only when there are other players.  Buyers of new CoD through Windows Store are deprived of this pleasure. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Online on Microsoft's servers is almost zero, as the vast majority of gamers acquire games in Valve's digital Steam store (even if this game is launched through another proprietary client, as is the case with the <a href="https://www.origin.com/rus/ru-ru/store">EA Origin</a> digital platform).  The fact that, for some reason, Call of Duty customers through the built-in Windows store do not have access to the rest of the community, put Microsoft in a difficult position.

That's exactly what Microsoft did: they returned one of the players money for the game, thereby creating a precedent for all other buyers. <br><br>  At the same time, Microsoft representatives <a href="http://www.windowscentral.com/call-duty-coming-windows-store-not-without-some-drawbacks">disclaim responsibility</a> for the situation, indicating that the decision to divide PC-platform players on the basis of the store was made by Activision. <br><br>  ‚ÄúWe support cross-platform games if the manufacturer wants this,‚Äù said a company representative. <br><br>  In their address regarding the situation with Call of Duty, Microsoft representatives point out the fact that Activision refused to support cross-platform within the Microsoft ecosystem, that is, between Xbox One and Windows 10. To play on the console and PC, you need to purchase two different versions games, even if the purchase is made for the platform of Windows 10. <br><br>  Microsoft writes that isolation of console players from PC players is expected due to the gap exactly between the gamepad and the mouse, but isolation by the store‚Äôs basis on one platform came as a surprise. <br><br>  Whether the main reason for this situation was unsuccessful PR company from Microsoft, which tried to attract customers in the Windows Store, or Activision‚Äôs reluctance to build a network between customers of different stores, is an open question.  In any case, whoever is ultimately guilty, players can get their money back to buy the game already on Steam and fully enjoy the multiplayer mode. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/399031/">https://habr.com/ru/post/399031/</a></p>
