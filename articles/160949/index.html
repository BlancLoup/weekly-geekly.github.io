  <section class="page js-page"><h1>There will be no price increase for domains in the .COM zone!</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  We already wrote that VeriSign planned to conclude a <a href="http://www.webnames.ru/scripts/newsmaker.pl%3Fnews_id%3D988">new registration agreement</a> with ICANN and the US government, according to which the company will be entitled to increase the cost of registering domain names in the zone in the next four years. OM by 7%.  At least, the fact that ICANN, after its approval, would increase the annual income from domain registration in the .COM zone by $ 8 million, says how much this contract is beneficial.  And ICANN has already approved this contract, contrary to protests from the general public. <br><br>  However, the US Department of Commerce <a href="http://www.webnames.ru/scripts/newsmaker.pl%3Fnews_id%3D1143">expressed doubts about</a> the legality of such price increases and launched an investigation that lasted more than a month. <a name="habracut"></a>  Director of VeriSign Jim Bizos soon after the appearance in the media of open information about the conflict with the US government <a href="http://www.webnames.ru/scripts/newsmaker.pl%3Fnews_id%3D1147">said</a> that the company had no complaints, and the new contract would soon be signed. <br><br>  But, as it turned out, these words were aimed only at comforting VeriSign partners.  A sensational news was announced on November 30: The US Department of Commerce <a href="http://www.ntia.doc.gov/files/ntia/publications/amendment_32_11292012.pdf">prohibits</a> VeriSign from increasing the cost of registration operations in the .COM zone, and the maximum price for a domain should not exceed $ 7.85.  Now, according to the terms of the contract, VeriSign can increase the cost of domains only by special agreement with the US Department of Commerce and only in force majeure circumstances (major security problems on the Internet or drastic changes in the economic situation).

      Thus, the company had to conclude a new agreement on the registration of domains in the .COM zone for a period of six years (until November 30, 2018), and there is no longer a scandalous clause on increasing the cost of domains in the zone. OM by 7%. <br><br>  Head of the Ministry of Commerce Larry Strickling <a href="http://www.ntia.doc.gov/press-release/2012/department-commerce-approves-verisign-icann-com-registry-renewal-agreement">said</a> that the new contract has become much more profitable for consumers, and at the same time does not pose a threat to the security of the DNS, as it stipulates that, if necessary, VeriSign will be able to agree on a temporary increase in the price of domains in protection needs.  Recall that VeriSign justified the price increase by the cost of protection against cyber attacks and possible technical failures. <br><br>  Entering into a contract without a price increase is beneficial to all domain owners in the .COM zone, especially large companies that register multiple domains in order to protect their trademarks.  For example, more than 91,000 names have been registered to Microsoft, and most of them are in the .COM zone.  Also, domain businessmen, who also have hundreds and thousands of names in their portfolio, will be delighted. <br><br>  ICANN has somewhat spoiled its reputation with its desire for profit at any cost, but the US government did what ICANN itself had to do according to its own charter: manage the domain name registration policy for the benefit of all Internet users. <br><br>  VeriSign and its partners will lose tens of millions of dollars, which, it would seem, were already in their hands.  The company, if it plans to continue development, remains to invest all its strength in promoting its developments in the field of Internet security and hope for the success of new gTLDs: VeriSign has applied for registration of .COM and .NET analogues in other types of letters. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/160949/">https://habr.com/ru/post/160949/</a></p>
