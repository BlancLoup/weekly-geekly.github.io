      Why is it so important to turn new customers into loyal customers and further into brand evangelists?  A satisfied customer brings 10 times more than the cost of his first purchase. <a name="habracut"></a>  But truly successful companies use the following principle: 80% of profits bring only 20% of customers.  This is possible, provided that they are loyal customers.  And the most important thing in all this is that the cost of such a client is close to 0 rubles. <br><br>  If the goal of your business is to live long and prosper, then any efforts aimed at customer loyalty will certainly pay off.  The trouble is that few of the businessmen of the post-Soviet space clearly understand what customer loyalty is and why their business needs it. <br><br>  The main principle according to which medium and small businessmen carry out their business processes is to sell and forget.  A valid approach, but it does not guarantee that the business will break away from competitors or at least survive. <br><br>  It was here that we had an idea: didn‚Äôt we hold a series of lectures on ‚ÄúAttracting and retaining customers in the Network‚Äù for our beloved Petersburg businessmen and business ladies.  We were puzzled by the format.  What time is convenient?  How to gather people with a constant lack of time?  Entrepreneurs are busy people - they often don‚Äôt have time to have breakfast, let alone attend evening lectures.  It was decided to collect them in the city center in a cozy cafe and feed breakfast.  And just at breakfast to give a lecture on customer loyalty on the web.  Certainly not free, because everything in this world has its price, and expert knowledge is even more so, but for the purely symbolic cost of 500 rubles. <br><br>  The first <a href="https://improschool.timepad.ru/event/255922/%3Futm_refcode%3D06e788da0b2230e824bb8207d633217a5775e12c">business breakfast</a> will be held this Friday, October 23 at 10:00.  The next one is planned for November 3, by the way, we will conduct crash tests on the websites of all the guests at breakfast.  And further on a regular basis in the form of a series.  We will carry the torch into the dark rows of Russian business.  At the end of the first event, we undertake to provide a report in the spirit of ‚ÄúHow was it?‚Äù, So that there is no doubt that our mission is high, educational, and not purely material. <br><br>  We are for the prosperity of the Russian entrepreneur ... and for high-quality, precisely calibrated marketing, which solves business problems without demanding permanent cash flow budgets. <br><br>  <b>Thanks for attention!</b>  <b>Come to our events and subscribe to our newsletter.</b>  <b>Your school of Internet marketing <a href="http://impro.pro/">IMpro</a> .</b> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/295590/">https://habr.com/ru/post/295590/</a></p>
