      <b>Maxim Bukhteev (Project Manager):</b> <i>‚ÄúWe are the ONLY project of such a level in Russia that has full access to the unique high-quality humor content of the TNT channel.</i>  <i>According to unrelenting statistics, netizens are interested in more professional videos than amateur videos.</i> <i><br></i>  <i>Having a huge television experience, we know how to produce it SPECIALLY for the network.</i>  <i>In addition, we are ready to pay users real money for high-quality and funny video.</i>  <i>We have developed a rather complex and unique system that allows us to determine the actual popularity of the video and the corresponding amount of material incentives.</i>  <i>This mechanism is currently being tested and will be launched soon.</i>  <i>Some features, such as rating - are already working on the site "</i> <br><br><br><h4>  8th place </h4><br> <a href="http://www.mydreamis.ru/"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/8fa/c78/a6d/8fac78a6d11f3aa353a69d266b4fb676.jpg" alt="image" width="240" height="84"></a> <br>  <a href="http://www.mydreamis.ru/">www.mydreamis.ru</a> <br>  Mydreamis.ru - online piggy bank of your desires.  The project is not new in its own way.  However, it seemed to me that it was made very nice and comfortable.  In addition, the very approach to the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãvis lists has been changed.  Here you can not just see what your friends and other people want as a gift, but also give them a couple of hundred rubles so that they can quickly save up for their dream. <br><br>  <b>Aleskey Rybin (Founder):</b> <i>‚ÄúOur project Mydreamis is very young.</i>  <i>We launched it in test mode quite recently and a lot has not been done yet.</i>  <i>The habr-community helped in this respect very much, after the publication of our post, people wrote and suggested good ideas, some of which are now being completed and will be added to the next.</i>  <i>a week</i>  <i>While we are not building distant plans, we are now working with might and main on the second stage of the project: various beautiful widgets will be finally added for posting on blogs, also now if you are registered and replenish someone‚Äôs dream, the donations will be counted on your page and top patrons to somehow encourage and highlight people who help others.</i>  <i>Anyone who writes us with wishes for improving the service - thank you very much! ‚Äù</i> <br><br><br><h4>  7th place </h4><br> <a href="http://www.krolik.ru/"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/637/e91/ca0/637e91ca0a89a65fac8f9f9a6d8d8058.jpg" alt="image"></a> <br>  <a href="http://www.krolik.ru/">www.krolik.ru</a> <br>  Krolik.ru is a social network that unites people connected with cinema, show business and / or advertising: professionals of various markets of mass communications, as well as viewers, critics and observers.  This project is especially interesting in the context of the fact that people like Fyodor Bondarchuk, Polina Deripaska and Daria Zhukova will invest in it, and Nikita Mikhalkov will conduct master classes on it.  The total amount of the planned investment is approximately $ 8 million. <br><br>  <b>Fyodor Bondarchuk (Founder):</b> <i>‚ÄúThere are 200 short professional films, it is assumed that they will be uploaded to the site, where I will take master classes with my participation, Nikita Mikhalkov and other directors.</i>  <i>The situation with this project crippled crisis.</i>  <i>Investors who were supposed to invest in Krolik.ru, abandoned their plans "</i> <br><br><br><h4>  6th place </h4><br> <a href="http://www.risovaska.ru/"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/114/a8d/7c9/114a8d7c9f6610617cb95b843e5c8e2e.jpg" alt="image"></a> <br>  <a href="http://www.risovaska.ru/">www.risovaska.ru</a> <br>  Risasaska is ICQ in which words are replaced by visual images.  Communication tool with which you can draw together with friends, create jointly comics from pictures, and even your own TV channels based on shared online drawing. <br><br>  <b>Roman Vorushin (Project Manager):</b> <i>‚ÄúOur advantages are:</i> <i><br></i>  <i>a) New mechanics.</i>  <i>Not a collaborative drawing, but an instant messaging postcard.</i>  <i>The differences are the same as between microblogging and blogging.</i> <i><br></i>  <i>b) Our experience in creating community environments (to make a full</i> <i><br></i>  <i>channels, you need to grow a community in size and complexity comparable to</i> <i><br></i>  <i>community Habra)</i> <i><br></i>  <i>c) Pure bright idea of ‚Äã‚Äãthe project, bright memorable brand.</i> <i><br></i>  <i>We plan to earn money by selling individualization tools.</i> <i><br></i>  <i>users - clipart, drawing tools, avatars, etc.</i> <i><br></i>  <i>Examples of projects that successfully implement such a business model:</i> <i><br></i>  <i>meez.com, imvu.com ¬ª</i> <br><br><br><h4>  5th place </h4><br> <a href="http://www.worksection.com/"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/8bf/e37/a6f/8bfe37a6f06435f091235e5bb1b29b79.jpg" alt="image"></a> <br>  <a href="http://www.worksection.com/">www.worksection.com</a> <br>  Worksection is a project management system.  The system is paid, however, 30 days can be used for free.  Of the advantages I want to highlight a very pleasant, I thought the design.  It's nice that full privacy is provided.  Some tariff plans have a secure SSL data transfer protocol.  The creators themselves from the pluses distinguish, for example, a convenient personal notepad, the ability to prioritize tasks, a minimal visual text editor. <br><br><br><h4>  4th place </h4><br> <a href="http://www.kommandcore.ru/"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/56f/a6e/ea4/56fa6eea4be1ae63ae060dc75fc90f5e.jpg" alt="image"></a> <br>  <a href="http://www.kommandcore.ru/">www.kommandcore.ru</a> <br>  Kommandcore is a project management system that incorporates new information principles.  This primarily resulted in an innovative program interface.  The creators promise us a simple, dynamic, lively project management, effective interaction of all project participants, their joint promotion to the project goal. <br><br>  <b>Mikhail Savinov (Founder):</b> <i>‚ÄúOur service is designed for people working in project and network logic (by network logic, we mean network and network-centric organizations located in the public and business spheres).</i>  <i>Potentially, the range of users of our system is not limited to small and medium-sized companies.</i>  <i>Moreover, the logic of the implementation of large complex projects with a large number of</i> <i><br></i>  <i>information and can easily be used by many participants</i> <i><br></i>  <i>at the same time maintaining transparency of management and work with</i> <i><br></i>  <i>information "</i> <br><br><br><h4>  3rd place </h4><br> <a href="http://www.liveexpert.ru/"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/9dd/ce0/83d/9ddce083d36f70ddd1879c7ab8b5bd20.jpg" alt="image"></a> <br>  <a href="http://www.liveexpert.ru/">www.liveexpert.ru</a> <br>  LiveExpert is a voice consultation system for all questions.  Consultations are carried out on a fee basis.  Pay per minute, however, sometimes experts provide their services for free.  The site already has experts from various fields, from plant care to spirituality and law.  For consultations you do not need anything other than a microphone, all the software provides the site.  Download also do not have to.  In addition, you yourself can become an expert and earn from their knowledge. <br><br>  <b>Oleg Oks (Founder):</b> <i>‚ÄúThe project will be successful at the expense of a unique business model that has proven itself in the West and is slightly adapted to the Russian audience.</i>  <i>The rest of the projects in our niche in RuNet do not have the opportunity to conduct a direct dialogue with a consultant, but you can communicate only on the forum, or in the form of question-answer.</i> <i><br></i>  <i>A business model is a community of experts in various fields where you can get online consultation in the form of a dialogue (that is, in a video chat, not on the forum, in the future we also plan a telephone connection), while you can choose an expert yourself and communicate with him in advance.</i> <i><br></i>  <i>Monetization is a small commission from paid consultations.</i>  <i>We are planning to get a plus in 2 years. ‚Äù</i> <br><br><br><h4>  2nd place </h4><br> <a href="http://www.yatv.ru/"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/5dd/5f9/fed/5dd5f9feddc1f7c4eead68f0cb80b513.jpg" alt="image"></a> <br>  <a href="http://www.yatv.ru/">www.yatv.ru</a> <br>  TV is an online personal TV service.  A platform that allows any network user to loudly say "Television is me!".  In order to open your channel you do not need multimillion investments; now you just need a webcam and your desire.  You can not only broadcast live, but also create a network of programs, record your broadcasts, and receive instant feedback in the chat.  In the west, such projects have long been successful.  Whether our market is ready for them, we will soon find out. <br><br>  <b>Anatoly Vorontsov (Developer):</b> <i>‚ÄúWe are not a project, but a resource that provides services to users who want to create their own TV channel on the network.</i>  <i>A wide range of services, such as creating live broadcasts from anywhere in the world, creating and storing data recordings of broadcasts, creating and editing the schedule of your own broadcasts and broadcasts, the possibility of public and private broadcasts with a password and only for friends‚Äôs friends is now aimed at changing the way people see network, and behind its expanses about television, which it is in its usual form at this stage.</i>  <i>Television in the near future will not only be personal and interactive, but will also completely change from the inside. ‚Äù</i> <br><br><br><h4>  1 place </h4><br> <a href="http://www.chat.ru/"><img src="http://chat.ru/img/logo.png" alt="image"></a> <br>  <a href="http://www.chat.ru/">www.chat.ru</a> <br>  Chat.ru is the reincarnation of a very popular earlier project.  Moreover, the reincarnation is very fresh and interesting.  The approach to the chat, as such, is conceptually changed.  Now you can discuss any page on the Internet without leaving it, but simply by clicking on the link ‚Äúchat.ru/ URL of the page‚Äù.  Provided very convenient tools for discussing online projects and news.  Very viable English version.  It's nice that you can chat on Chat.ru with the help of Jabber. <br><br>  <b>Daniil Bratchenko (Developer):</b> <i>‚ÄúThe very concept of the chat has changed.</i>  <i>If earlier chat was a separate page of a separate site, then now you can discuss any page without leaving it.</i>  <i>Of course, you will say that there are comments here, and so on, but after all, comments are not at all the same as live, real-time communication.</i>  <i>In addition, not all sites the ability to leave reviews made really convenient.</i>  <i>And what if you want to discuss some kind of page on which commenting is not provided at all?</i>  <i>Then the new Chat.Ru comes to the rescue. ‚Äù</i> <br><br><h4>  Six other startups in January: </h4><br>  <a href="http://www.linkphone.ru/">www.linkphone.ru</a> - cheap phone call internet service <br>  <a href="http://www.vkoshelke.ru/">www.vkoshelke.ru</a> - personal finance accounting system. <br>  <a href="http://www.abyrvalg.com/">www.abyrvalg.com</a> - true reviews of real people about all the places in your city <br>  www.brainstock.ru is a naming and branding exchange where you can earn with your mind. <br>  <a href="http://www.tvnewz.ru/">www.tvnewz.ru</a> - Video news leading channels. <br>  <a href="http://www.progg.ru/">www.progg.ru</a> is a project that will help find interesting links to information technology topics. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/50959/">https://habr.com/ru/post/50959/</a></p>
