Select a domain.  Most novice merchants for their IM choose the most consonant with the selected product domains.  There are many clone sites with similar names.  That can greatly hinder in the future: unfair competition or dishonest merchant (all the lumps of dissatisfied customers will fall on you).

      Practice: in Ukraine there is a site elitparfum.com.ua, there is also elit-parfum.com.ua, elite-parfume.kiev.ua, elite-parfum.com.ua.  Some of them sell fakes. <br><br>  2. Business with a friend or relative.  Here opinions differ.  But from personal experience: ‚Äúif you want to quarrel with a friend, invite to business.‚Äù  At first everything goes well, trust each other.  Then money becomes more, views on business diverge dramatically.  The problems begin. <br><br>  3. The desire to implement a bunch of cool ideas prevents common sense.  Ideas are good.  But the implementation of these ideas can not only harm sales, but also in vain to eat the money invested.  It is necessary to think carefully over ideas, consult with professionals. <br><br>  Practice: due to an unsuccessful choice of an engine 1000 cu <br><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  5. Miser pays twice.  You are an online marketer, but you have not yet learned this postulate?  You were either lucky or you did nothing.  Work with professionals, even if they require more.  But no one is immune from the fact that the professionals will be ‚Äúlime‚Äù.  Be careful. <br><br>  Practice: working with some freelancers has caused the project to freeze for a while. <br><br>  6. Calculated income, but did not consider the increase in costs.  So do inexperienced businessmen.  The level of income, the time to reach the level is calculated, but it is not taken into account that certain costs are required to achieve this level.  It is here that rainbow fantasies are crumbling. <br><br>  Practice: reaching an income of thousands of cu  costs also increased by orders of magnitude. <br><br>  7. Complication of everything from the very beginning.  Remember, simplicity = success.  The easier it is to get the goods from you, the more customers there will be. <br><br>  Practice: for beauty and originality, the Ajax catalog was invented, which caused a problem with returning to the previous page.  There were other problems. <br><br>  8. Wrong planning of the advertising budget.  The launch of advertising will not give an instant increase in the client.  Even from contextual advertising effect begins in a week.  For banner not less than a month.  Plan not coverage sites, and the duration of advertising on the sites. <br><br>  Practice: 500 USD were thrown. <br><br>  9. Terrible service.  It is not ironic, but many stores forget what good service is.  The client is willing to pay more for quality service.  Your low price can be interrupted by a lower price.  Quality service is difficult to kill. <br><br>  Practice: the notorious callback within 15-20 minutes, as it turns out to be a rare phenomenon among MI.  In 90% of cases, our managers call in this gap.  According to our customers, many competitors do not even care about the callback. <br><br>  10. Dumping.  Too low price scares buyers.  Human psychology is built on choosing a middle ground. <br><br>  Practice: There is always a lot of hungry freebies, but doubts about the quality of the product due to low prices are still in my head.  This is shown by the words of our customers. <br><br>  Figures: Marketing Director nadavi.com.ua (price comparison service for goods) announced the figures that the main clicks fall on mid-price offers </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/57148/">https://habr.com/ru/post/57148/</a></p>
