At the moment when the number of terminals and their suppliers began to go off-scale, and the OSMP system itself was not fundamentally different from any of them, the company made a ‚Äúknight's move‚Äù - created a new brand ‚ÄúQiwi‚Äù.  They say that the company spent several hundred thousand dollars on rebranding, of which about a hundred were spent on a new style, and the rest of the money was spent on technical expenses - changing interfaces, replacing terminals and other pleasant things. <br><br>  Until today, I have come across only the positive side of the service, but recently I got into a stalemate situation, which I would like to tell you about, and at the same time warn other users.

    <a name="habracut"></a><br>  At the beginning of the year, I made one of the most popular operations, ‚ÄúQiwi‚Äù, replenished my mobile phone account with 10,000 rubles, making it in three calls due to some terminal restriction.  A few minutes later the payment confirmation came to my phone: 4000 rubles were credited to my account.  Beeline‚Äôs support informed me that they were seeing the remaining two payments and that they would soon be credited.  Fine! <br><br>  Problems began a little later.  Two weeks later, I received a message from Beeline, reporting that the money in the account is running out and I need to replenish the account.  A few minutes later I learned that those two payments had not reached them.  The call to Qiwi support was very pleasant: the girl on the other end of the line introduced herself as ‚ÄúNatalia's personal assistant‚Äù, after which she found my payments, apologized and said that in the coming hours the payments would be confirmed.  A few days later the payment did not appear.  Ok, repeat the call to Qiwi.  Again, apologies, please write to the address help@qiwi.ru.  No question - a letter with a detailed story is sent to this e-mail.  Wake-up call: in response, a letter comes with a request to ‚Äúkeep the subject of the letter‚Äù during repeated calls.  It was not difficult at all, since there was no topic at all in that letter.  In addition, the letter had the inscription "In response to:" after which nothing was written either.  Well, okay, the letter was sent, it remains only to wait a measly 14 days before the answer to the support. <br><br>  Two weeks later, I decided to ask again about the fate of 6,000 rubles.  This time, the support was already set up more strictly: I was sent to the terminal itself with a request to print a repeat check, but, alas, the terminal did not know anything about it and did not give a check.  :-) When I called again, I was asked to send another email to help@qiwi.ru, but then I already understood that it wasn‚Äôt that someone read and tried to find out who could help me in less than two weeks.  The answer was a handset put in a couple of minutes of questions.  Thank you, personal assistant Marina. <br><br>  <i>I answer the question about the check in advance: for the month of carrying the check from the thermal printer in my pocket, it just collapsed, and besides, ‚ÄúQiwi‚Äù never said that money was not received.</i> <br><br>  <b>Bottom line: if you do not have a scan or photo of your check, the exact number of the terminal, then your money may just disappear.</b>  <b>A customer service outside of a baseline scenario just won't talk to you.</b>  <b>The same situation can happen with your online store or another service connected to Qiwi.</b> <br><br>  upd .: 3 months have passed, there is no solution. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/84917/">https://habr.com/ru/post/84917/</a></p>
