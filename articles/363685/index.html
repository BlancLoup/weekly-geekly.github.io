It is increasingly overgrown with functional tools that help speed up the process of transmitting information and at the same time increase the amount of information transmitted.  Our civilization has certainly succeeded in this.  We shorten words, simplify sentences, and invent "special" words.  It seems that in our information age, human speech has reached a certain peak of development. <br><br>  But, in my opinion, we turned the wrong way and reached an impasse. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  I propose to start from scratch, so that we understand each other better. <br><br>  What is the word? 
      <br>

      <br>
      The word is a materialized thought. <br><br>  In conversation, in order to convey to the interlocutor some information, we use words.  Each of us is sure that he fully understands which word should be used at one time or another and how the listener will perceive it.  If everything is so simple, if we know how to speak and how to listen, then why then what can I imagine in my mind instantly, do I have to explain for hours? <br><br>  Why is speech so imperfect?  Why can't I convey - even if not at such a speed, the image that I imagine in my head?  After all, it is he, or rather the desire to show / convey it, is the cause of speech.  How is it possible that for the transfer of such a voluminous and multidimensional image a person only thought of what to invent such an imperfect instrument - speech? <br><br>  The answers to all these questions are not straightforward, but I can say with confidence that we have missed something.  Man could not create such an imperfect tool for the transfer of extremely voluminous and multidimensional thinking. <br><br>  Well, I will try to restore the original model of speech. <br><br>  What is the structure of the word as a unit of information? <br>  The structure of the word can be divided into three levels: <br><ul><li>  Sound component; </li><li>  Semantic component; </li><li>  Emotional component. </li></ul><br>  First of all, we create sound with the help of air and vibrations of vocal folds.  The sound component plays the role of a ‚Äúshortcut‚Äù that triggers the mechanism for the formation of the transmitted image.  Try to think why certain words sound exactly the way they sound? <br><br>  Next, we determine the meaning of the spoken word, the information it carries.  This is a very important stage of information transfer.  Each of us must clearly understand that the meaning of the spoken word may differ from the person who utters the word and who accepts it.  From here comes the first problem of the speech system.  In order to convey to the person the image that is needed exactly, you have to use a pile of complementary words, this very slows down the process of transmitting information and greatly loads it. <br><br>  And finally, in every word there lives an emotion.  There are many words in our language with which we can describe ‚Äúmood‚Äù; I call these words ‚Äúatmospheric‚Äù.  For example, to describe something vile, I can use words like: <br><ul><li>  Slime </li><li>  Pus </li><li>  Bile, etc. </li></ul><br>  These words are unlikely to be needed if you suddenly want to describe the past children's holiday (although ...), since they initially carry a certain emotion that does not correspond to the atmosphere of the holiday. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/402/31b/2c4/40231b2c4b2c4cf89059b6f6de1c9f55.png"></div><br><br>  Having described three ‚Äúlevels‚Äù of a word as a unit of information, we can arrive at an amazing conclusion.  With the sound component of the word everything seems to be clear, but with the other two stages, which just give rise to an image in our mind, things are worse.  Over time, we have lost the accuracy and clarity that is essential for the formation of the correct and, most importantly, the same image of the interlocutors.  When you pronounce certain words, laying the meaning and emotions in them, to form a certain image, you may encounter that the ‚Äúreceiver‚Äù simply means that the words that you say may be associated with a completely different meaning and other emotions.  As a result, the information is not transmitted or transmitted in a distorted form, and everything that is not the truth is a lie! <br><br>  Our civilization must pay special attention to this problem.  We have one very unpleasant feature to me, we are disfiguring everything with materialization, often forgetting about energy, and in fact it is always and in everything primary, and it is energy that is the cause of everything.  In the case of language, we have overwritten its energetic (imaginative, emotional) part with information, this has made it stupid and soulless, like a computer.  Yes, he is fast;  yes, it is informative;  Yes, it is universal, but how can a computer know the beauty of a butterfly's flight over a poppy field?  With the help of informational content, can we convey the pleasure from the smell of freshly cut grass and the emotional memories of the months spent in the village with my grandmother that this smell gives us in our mind? <br><br>  Not!  Only energy can do this. <br><br>  The article is introductory, it reflects only one facet of the problem, the problem is much wider.  The knowledge that I have tried to convey is needed only to stir up the thought processes in your heads.  I got it or not, read in the comments. <br><br>  I would like to express special thanks to Marina Moiseeva for writing this article.  I am eternally grateful to you for bringing so much creativity into my life, so much emotion, so much tenderness.  I love you dear. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/363685/">https://habr.com/ru/post/363685/</a></p>
