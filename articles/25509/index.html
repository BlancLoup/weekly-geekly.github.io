  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Novice programmers</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"><h1>  Foreword </h1><br>  Not so long ago, I saw on Habr√© a topic in which a link was given for those who want to get a job with a guru who would become a mentor.  Naturally in the initial positions.  Break the whole habr, I never found that topic, if anyone remembers, give a reference in the comment. <br><br><h1>  Topic </h1><br>  I have a good friend, a former colleague, let's call him Kolya.  Kohl - a novice programmer, with experience less than a year as a web programmer.  He knows PHP5, MySQL and how to administer Apache.  His main experience is the development of cms under the guidance of a guru for a large project, which, unfortunately, not by the decision of the developers, was closed.  Now Kolya was out of work. <br><br>  I think you all understand that the current situation in the labor market is such that more or less serious projects require only a guru, and no one wants to engage in mentoring - not everyone can afford it financially.  Specialists such as Kolya are needed primarily for projects where the leader is headed, according to knowledge, not superior to Kohl, otherwise he would understand that this person will have to invest time and knowledge and a quick payback should not be expected. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Separately, I will say that Kolya received a higher education diploma this winter.  Last summer, he worked only as a PC operator (work on database), and it sufficed him so much that he just took a php tutorial and started to figure it out.  Looking for a job as a programmer, he certainly didn‚Äôt go right after he managed to write ‚ÄúHello World!‚Äù, But he really didn‚Äôt have experience of participating in projects.  He was very lucky when his burning eyes and desire to work saw the guru, with whom he later worked for almost a year.  Please do not ask what happened to the guru, I will only say that he decided to go underground for a certain time.

    <h1>  Work for Kolya </h1><br>  Dear gurus!  Let's help Kolya to become the right programmer!  The php language is already being scolded for the fact that almost everyone can write on it and because of this there are a lot of projects with poor code quality.  Kohl really wants to increase his level of knowledge of php5 and really does not part with the books.  But to stay at home and write something of your own without a mentor will not work - you need to earn, Kohl is a man, he already has a family (in the summer he will be 23 years old :) It would be wonderful if you could consider the possibility of Kolya‚Äôs participation in large interesting projects . <br>  Naturally, the study of new technologies, he welcomes. <br><br>  For employment issues, you can write to Kolya in lichku or mail mc@surkova.net.  Thanks for attention. <br>  PS: Kohl does not know about this habratopic =) </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/25509/">https://habr.com/ru/post/25509/</a></p>
