  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Facebook, Reddit, Twitter keep in mind: Steemit is already here with you and your news feeds</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"><p>  Steemit is going to take the world by storm, faster than Myspace, YouTube, Facebook, Reddit or Twitter did. </p><br><p>  I have been using social networks since the popularity of Myspace, I have seen waves of people switching from one platform to another for 2 years, amid a 100-fold increase in social media audience.  I remember searching for new songs online to add them to my Myspace page, learning HTML just to add a new background image to my profile and the worst of all is having to choose the best 8 tracks.  At that time, these things were very important for a 14-year-old me and I did not have any problems in order to understand how and to do what I needed.  My page was the most attractive among my 200 friends!  My top 8 was hidden, my song was included in the general playlist, and my HTML was so strong that I could add a separate background to each page.  I was delighted. </p><br><p>  And then Facebook appeared ... </p><a name="habracut"></a><br><p>  At first, I continued to be a loyal user of Myspace, and for years laughed at how uncomfortable Facebook was, useless, and ugly.  But one by one all my friends went on Facebook, some went on Twitter, and some stuck with me on Myspace.  However, less than a year later, I ended up on that boring, ugly, useless Facebook, and I fell in love with it.  Why?  No idea.  It just happened. </p><br><p>  After several years of using Facebook, you can notice the changes that have occurred in it, appearing more and more day after day and, before anyone has noticed, Facebook has become the # 1 social network on the Internet, even without typing a billion users.  For some reason, I always didn‚Äôt like Facebook, I don‚Äôt like it now, but that doesn‚Äôt stop me from using it.  How can I keep in touch with everyone I know?  Even after learning about Facebook‚Äôs relationship with the US government, I continued to post pictures, photos of life, and chat with friends every day.  I am surprised at my carelessness, but I continue to sacrifice my privacy for the sake of a convenient opportunity to contact someone ... Do not jump off the hook </p><br><p>  Let's go back in today.  Steemit is designed to change the usual course of things. </p><br><p>  Steemit is finally here.  Just like Facebook, YouTube, Twitter, Instagram appeared many years ago, it appeared as a project with a goal, and this goal is users.  Unlike the others, Steemit has one important advantage over its competitors - it pays users for using the site, and it does this in the most natural way.  Should I focus on the importance of this feature?  This means that we no longer need the content monetization model using advertising.  FOR EVERYTHING AND FOREVER.  And now think about how many people have united Facebook, united, making it possible to communicate with each other a little easier ... Steemit will change this, making up a competition that has never been seen before. </p><br><p>  Think again: the world, without advertising, where every author receives money for his / her articles without a mediator. </p><br><p>  PS As for me, it is a bit exaggerated for a startup, but the startup is already working, and quite successfully.  Isn‚Äôt it time for the administrations of Facebook, Twitter, Vkontakte, HABRAHABR to really pay attention to it and think? </p><br><p>  PPS Although this is unlikely to change the impression that the post is an ‚Äúadvertisement‚Äù, I still mention that everything is mixed up on the blockchain with the issuing of its own cryptocurrency used as payment to the authors. <br>  PPPS <br>  So <a href="https://steemit.com/ru-steem/%40usefree/facebook-reddit-twitter-imeite-v-vidu-steemit-uzhe-tut-s-vami-i-vashimi-novostnymi-lentami">welcome to Steemit</a> <br>  PPPPS <br>  <a href="https://steemit.com/steem/%40hipster/bumaga-pro-stim-steem-whitepaper-translated-into-russian">White-paper</a> Translation </p></div>
