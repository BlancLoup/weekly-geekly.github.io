Like any such tool, it has its advantages and disadvantages and, as I believe, it has more of the first ones. <br><br>  Oddly enough, on Habr√© I did not find a single topic dedicated to this frame.  Apparently the reason is that the framework has no documentation at all, which is why it resembles a ‚Äúframework in itself‚Äù and ‚Äúfor its own‚Äù.  However, this is not entirely true, but more on that later.

    <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  The purpose of this note is to draw the attention of the professional community to a truly worthwhile development, as well as to combine the existing knowledge about this framework and the experience of using it.  Perhaps in the future, it will turn out to compile at least some documentation from the collected material, so I will be very grateful to you for the information that you will share. <br><br>  I note that I am not one of the creators of the framework, but I am a user of it and want to learn more about it, and also, perhaps, lay out my work on its basis.  So, let's begin. <br><br><h4>  Introduction </h4><br>  The framework was born and grew up in a team of people who created it and developed it for their own needs, as far as I understood, since 2005.  The earliest publicly available version is version 0.2, dated September 3, 2005.  Since then, the framework has changed dramatically, new features have been added to it, and bugs have been fixed.  Now onPHP is a worthy candidate for the role of the foundation for a web project of any scale.  The latest stable version is 1.0. <br><br><h4>  Advantages and disadvantages. </h4><br>  As I have already said, any tool (or rather simply any tool) has its advantages and disadvantages, and onPHP is no exception.  Among the <b>advantages</b> I could highlight the following: <br><br><h5>  1. Rapid application development. </h5><br>  The onPHP tools allows you to quickly create the necessary classes and connections between them, build a database structure and check dependencies.  All this is done using an XML schema that describes the project entities.  More on this below.  In addition, there are convenient tools for accessing data: Criteria (well thought out port from Hibernate) and OSQL. <br><br><h5>  2. Horizontal scalability. </h5><br>  Deeply worked out the issue of caching.  As I understand it, this is the pride of the framework.  You can cache in different ways and very cleverly (file system, memcached, etc).  In addition, the database work layer supports work with several connections, and each managed entity can be specified which connection to use, i.e.  in fact, transparently store data in different databases. <br><br><h5>  3. Flexibility. </h5><br>  It lies in the fact that in the overwhelming majority of cases, the framework does not impose specific action patterns to create any functionality in your project.  At the same time, the framework provides all the necessary features to create what you want.  In the architecture of the framework, many well-known design patterns are used, and the framework itself provides opportunities for the ‚Äútemplate‚Äù of your own classes (StaticFactory, Singleton). <br><br><h5>  4. Speed. </h5><br>  As I understand it, it is achieved mainly due to very flexible caching.  But there is another factor - the module for php, which comes in the kit.  Some of the classes that are required constantly were designed as a module, which undoubtedly accelerated their work. <br><br><h5>  5. Quality and reliability. </h5><br>  The code is covered by unit tests.  Each new functionality that appears in the framework is covered by tests.  From the experience of use, I was pleasantly surprised by the stability and predictability of the behavior of the constructed system. <br><br><h5>  6. High-quality, clean and clear code. </h5><br>  Perhaps this is subjective, but this is my opinion and, apparently, the creators, too.  Strict <a href="http://git.shadanakar.org/%3Fp%3DonPHP.git%3Ba%3Dblob%3Bf%3Ddoc/CodingStyle%3Bh%3Db5cc95b21d991c619cca817af970ecd7a9d94dbc%3Bhb%3D1.0">coding slyle</a> , which you quickly get used to, contributes to the rapid perception of the code and even to some kind of aesthetic pleasure that occurs every time you look at the code. <br><br>  Perhaps of the merits is all.  <b>Disadvantages</b> : <br><br><h5>  1. Lack of documentation. </h5><br>  The creators of the framework believe that the API is the best documentation.  Personally, I disagree with them, so I decided to write this note with the hope that during the discussion and subsequent notes, at least some semblance of documentation will be born. <br><br><h5>  2. Small community. </h5><br>  This deficiency is a consequence of the first, because, due to the lack of documentation, the threshold of entry greatly increases, and the desire of many disappears.  Discussion of issues and proposals is carried out mainly through <a href="http://lists.shadanakar.org/onphp-dev-ru/">the mailing list</a> , in which there are discussions once a month or two. <br><br><h5>  3. Conflict classes. </h5><br>  The framework classes do not have a prefix, which creates problems when migrating projects to this framework.  Therefore, it is sometimes necessary to invent other names for those classes whose names are occupied in onPHP. <br><br><h4>  Where to begin? </h4><br>  In the git master, there is a <a href="http://git.shadanakar.org/%3Fp%3DonPHP.git%3Ba%3Dtree%3Bf%3Ddoc/tutorial%3Bh%3D43c6727e131f7d956ceed5513f5b57742ea2c86b%3Bhb%3Dmaster">very short tutorial</a> that contains recommendations on the typical structure of the project, the entry point (index.php), the use of the database, the use of forms (a powerful tool for accepting and validating input data) and an unfinished article about ACL, since it is still in the incubator. <br><br><h4>  Incubator. </h4><br>  This is the part of onPHP, in which there are those parts of the framework that have not yet officially acquired the final form and in which changes are possible, non-working functionality and other disorders.  Here is the development, debugging and testing.  New parts of the framework pass through the development in the incubator, and after stabilization they fall into the main section. <br>  For example, Acl, Tsearch (full-text search for PostgreSQL), FormRendering (centralized display of forms ‚Äî the Form object and its primitives), Application (an application and a set of its settings for easy customization), and several other packages are currently in the <a href="http://git.shadanakar.org/%3Fp%3DonPHP.git%3Ba%3Dtree%3Bf%3Dincubator%3Bh%3Db252f1badcbf599ff4e930c36ed3478d2840bc19%3Bhb%3Dmaster">incubator</a> . <br><br><h4>  Meta. </h4><br>  This part of the framework, located in the <a href="http://git.shadanakar.org/%3Fp%3DonPHP.git%3Ba%3Dtree%3Bf%3Dmeta%3Bh%3D84b338082f4f89fc57428d59812b53b2f3d2cfa1%3Bhb%3Dmaster">meta</a> folder, provides the ability to describe entities and their properties, as well as create the necessary classes for your future application.  The scheme is in XML format, which can be validated by the attached <a href="http://git.shadanakar.org/%3Fp%3DonPHP.git%3Ba%3Dblob%3Bf%3Dmeta/dtd/meta.dtd%3Bh%3D35a0b81a57a08f74ef9f8d00e0a98947f8ed8214%3Bhb%3Dmaster">meta.dtd</a> . <br><br>  Example schema: <br><blockquote><pre>  &lt;? xml version = "1.0"?&gt;
 &lt;! DOCTYPE metaconfiguration SYSTEM "meta.dtd"&gt;
 &lt;metaconfiguration&gt;
 &lt;classes&gt;
         &lt;class name = "Author" table = "authors"&gt;
                 &lt;properties&gt;
                         &lt;identifier /&gt;
                         &lt;property name = "name" type = "String" size = "50" required = "true" /&gt;
                 &lt;/ properties&gt;
                 &lt;pattern name = "StraightMapping" /&gt;
         &lt;/ class&gt;
         &lt;class name = "Book" table = "books"&gt;
                 &lt;properties&gt;
                         &lt;identifier /&gt;
                         &lt;property name = "title" type = "String" size = "50" required = "true" /&gt;
                         &lt;property name = "author" type = "Author" relation = "OneToOne" required = "true" fetch = "lazy" /&gt;
                 &lt;/ properties&gt;
                 &lt;pattern name = "StraightMapping" /&gt;
         &lt;/ class&gt;
 &lt;/ classes&gt;
 &lt;/ metaconfiguration&gt; </pre></blockquote><br>  What is interesting here: <br><br>  - For each entity, it indicates what properties it possesses and what their type is.  Based on this, meta-builder will recommend what changes to the database schema should be made, and also this can be used to validate these objects according to the form (Form). <br><br>  - You can immediately specify the relationship between entities, which will then be reflected in the generated classes.  OneToOne, OneToMany and ManyToMany are available.  It so happened that I always used the OneToOne connection, but I would like to know about the other types of connections (meaning not the theory, everything is in order, but the implementation in onPHP). <br><br>  - Pattern - is a pattern of the future class.  Unfortunately, I don‚Äôt know the features of all the templates, but here are some of them: <br><ol><li> <i>StraightMapping</i> - from the name it is clear that this is a direct object mapping for one record in the database table.  This is nothing but M. Fowler's ActiveRecord. </li><li>  <i>EnumerationClass</i> is an enumeration.  A class that does not have a table in the database, but is a linear list (id =&gt; name).  Used for data that never or almost never changes (for example, the month, zodiac signs, etc.) </li><li>  <i>AbstractClass</i> is an abstract class.  Used to define abstract classes in the schema, from which other classes will be inherited from the same schema. </li></ol>  The rest of the patterns ( <i>DictionaryClass, SpookedClass, SpookedEnumeration, ValueObject and InternalClass</i> ) are still unknown to me, I hope those who know will tell, and I will write it down. <br><br>  - fetch = "lazy" is an indication that when assembling an object, the Author property does not need to be loaded before accessing it.  In the example above, if I unload the Book object by ID: <br><blockquote><code>$book = Book::dao()-&gt;getById(1); <br> $author = $book-&gt;getAuthor();</code> </blockquote>  then for the Assembly of the Author object, a query will be made to the database to obtain the values ‚Äã‚Äãof its parameters.  With fetch = "cascade", all data on all connections is retrieved from the database in one request, after which the related objects are collected and available for use without additional requests. <br><br>  This is not all that can be used in meta, but for a brief overview it is enough.  Let's start generating classes. <br><br><h4>  Code Generation </h4><br>  In the <b>meta</b> folder there is a script <b>bin / build.php</b> , which with the help of nearby classes and turns the scheme into classes.  Let's see how to use it: <br><blockquote> <code>Usage: build.php [options] [project-configuration-file.inc.php] [metaconfiguration.xml]</code> </blockquote> <br>  Meta we have, but the configuration file is not.  Create it. <br><br>  There is a <b>global.inc.php.tpl</b> file in the <b>root</b> , which is the template for the configuration file.  Copy it and modify it as follows: <br>  a) add the constant <b>PATH_CLASSES</b> - where you will have generated classes. <br>  b) Add to set_include_path (): <br><blockquote> <code>.PATH_CLASSES.PATH_SEPARATOR <br> .PATH_CLASSES.'Auto'.PATH_SEPARATOR <br> .PATH_CLASSES.'Auto'.DIRECTORY_SEPARATOR.'Business'.PATH_SEPARATOR <br> .PATH_CLASSES.'Auto'.DIRECTORY_SEPARATOR.'DAOs'.PATH_SEPARATOR <br> .PATH_CLASSES.'Auto'.DIRECTORY_SEPARATOR.'Proto'.PATH_SEPARATOR <br> .PATH_CLASSES.'Business'.PATH_SEPARATOR <br> .PATH_CLASSES.'DAOs'.PATH_SEPARATOR <br> .PATH_CLASSES.'Proto'.PATH_SEPARATOR</code> </blockquote>  c) add the parameters of the connection with the database: <br><blockquote> <code>DBPool::me()-&gt;setDefault( <br> DB::spawn('PgSQL', 'user', 'password', 'localhost', 'dbname') <br> -&gt;setEncoding('utf-8') <br> );</code> </blockquote> <br>  Then, run <b>build.php</b> : <br><br><blockquote><pre>  $ ./meta/bin/build.php ./global.inc.php ./schema/project.xml <font></font>
