We prefer to search for ‚Äúcracks‚Äù, hack our devices or even pay money (!) To specialists who will help us with this. <br><br>  All attempts to inculcate a culture of buying licensed software, a film, a book, or music came down to threats, sanctions, and sentimental stories that the "poor creators" were starving.  These techniques were used so often that even if they once worked, they now definitely do not work. <br><br>  Ôøº <img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/6a2/bca/9dc/6a2bca9dc92343772928931e8c6dd7ac.jpg">

      But, from the general to the particular, and I would like to consider the expediency of such a thing as Jailbreak (‚Äúhacking‚Äù the iPhone, iPad).  Viewed from several points: <br><ul><li>  the benefits of the device </li><li>  the possibility of "upgrade". </li><li>  cost of ownership. </li></ul><a name="habracut"></a><h5>  The ideology and the benefits of the device </h5><br>  Apple's product, with its advanced industrial design and innovative technology, can be anything - an indicator of status and, even, a work of art, but its main function is to be an assistant to its owner, fulfilling its endless desires. <br><br>  People who buy an iPhone, iPad or iPod Touch can be beautiful, smart, and even brilliant, but not necessarily ‚Äúyou‚Äù with technology.  Therefore, Apple devices are easy to use and friendly to their owners. <br><br>  The company has created the devices and infrastructure around them so that people do not have the feeling of incorrectness of their actions.  Feelings that with one wrong decision they can lose their assistant.  Each new version of the operating system includes fantastic hitherto features, the transport of which to a human device is a matter of one button. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/425/471/ca9/425471ca9478caf91b229d2233fb80d6.jpg"><br><br>  ‚ÄúBurglars‚Äù tell people the opposite: ‚Äúbe careful with the changes in your phone, be careful when you synchronize it with your computer and, most importantly, do not update it!‚Äù. <br><br>  All these things worsen the quality of using the device and reduce the benefit for which the person initially paid. <br><br><h5>  Upgrade </h5><br>  The technology has a completely dizzying pace of development.  What was a ‚Äúhot‚Äù novelty yesterday, tomorrow is already in the hands of everyone, and the day after tomorrow - we give it to mothers.  Often, obsolescence, rather than physical deterioration of the device, causes the modern city dweller to change his device every couple of years.  As a rule, this is a painful process - you need to transfer contacts, photos, music, applications ... <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/24a/788/d05/24a788d052ebe51bebea0d2b6bb96175.jpg"><br><br>  Sounds like an advertisement, but Apple also took care of that.  This is part of the value for which you pay money when you purchase an i-device.  However, if it is ‚Äúhacked‚Äù, there is no guarantee that your ‚Äúdigital life‚Äù will move to a new ‚Äútoy‚Äù, that it will not be necessary to re-adjust everything for hours and that in a month it will not become clear that the ‚Äúphoto‚Äù is irretrievably lost. <br><br><h5>  Cost of ownership </h5><br>  Go to the numbers!  ‚ÄúCommercial jailbreak‚Äù today costs about $ 70 (in Kazakhstan) - somewhere more expensive, somewhere cheaper.  Perhaps the familiar ‚ÄúIT-Schnick‚Äù, by old friendship, will do everything in the best possible way and for $ 35.  This is several times less than the money spent on ‚Äúlegal‚Äù purchases.  Or not? <br><br>  Apple recently published its annual report and included application sales data.  The conclusion reached by <a href="http://www.asymco.com/2012/02/19/app-developers-get-12-for-each-ios-device-sold/">analysts</a> by simple calculations is as follows: on each device during its ‚Äúlife‚Äù, 75 applications are downloaded from the official site on average (including free ones).  It is interesting that at the same time, again, on average, only USD 17 is spent on their purchase, which is about 2 times less than the resulting ‚Äútax‚Äù for hacking services. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/c30/341/019/c3034101983f746f98db2fb392bc64da.jpg"><br><br>  Moreover, it can be assumed that in one visit to the ‚Äúhacker‚Äù a person will not get off - he will buy a new device, a new version of the operating system will be released, or the device ‚Äúsuddenly‚Äù will stop working.  In this case, for several years, you can overpay the cost of purchased applications several times. <br><br>  Statistics is an averaged thing and the choice is a personal matter, because someone can spend $ 50 a day on applications.  However, in most cases we see a person who has spent $ 1000 on a device and now saves on matches, making his purchase not only less useful, less reliable and less convenient, but also more expensive. <br><br><h5>  PS Perspective </h5><br>  Once upon a time there were two different cultures: in the Windows environment, it was not customary to pay for software, while the culture of Mac users assumed this. <br><br>  Many small and medium-sized teams of talented developers were simply not profitable to create products for the PC and they paid attention to a less common, but more attractive platform.  As a result, today, the quality of the average software product for Mac is much higher than the equivalent for Windows. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/663/deb/76e/663deb76e60fb7e77aefb3f32e74c79e.jpg"><br><br>  Now the app stores are booming and how good products they will make us happy in the future depends not only on Apple and Google, but also on us. <br><br>  Images taken from sites: <a href="http://www.iphoner.by/">www.iphoner.by</a> , <a href="http://www.stihi.ru/">www.stihi.ru</a> , <a href="http://www.gubkabob.rolka.su/">www.gubkabob.rolka.su</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/139100/">https://habr.com/ru/post/139100/</a></p>
