Comments include: <br>  - prerequisites <br>  - implementation scheme <br>  - budget :) <br>  - terms :)) <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  As far as I know, the quality of service in Kiev banks leaves much to be desired (almost everyone, I personally had to spend about 50 minutes in a certain branch of a certain bank to fill in one piece of paper - I had to pay, Internet junk, I decided to pay off online, not Internet Bank, as always I do).  They do not have a cashier staff, looking for.

      On the scale of the banking system as a whole - the press writes, as much as it chokes.  For example, the last Correspondent is ‚Äúretail swells, there are not enough people in banks‚Äù.  Those who are, banking erudition do not shine.  The result is a general decline in the quality of service. <br><br>  On the scale of everyday logic, banking retail swells, <br>  skilled labor does not increase, it is necessary to work on <br>  loyalty to somehow compensate for the decline in quality <br>  service and, perhaps, to make a normal reserve for the future (in terms of loyalty). <br><br>  The proposed scheme is as follows: <br>  1. A certain place is formed, where it is clear and (fun, pleasant, entertaining, <br>  interesting, professional) is about actual for people <br>  things related to money: mortgage, consumer lending. <br>  Outwardly, it looks like some kind of association wanting to know something about <br>  money.  The association itself is not necessary to register, but it depends on the scope of the project. <br>  2. For some short time - 5-6 months - this site develops <br>  (people ask, experts answer, people share their experiences and <br>  etc.).  During this time, you need to make sure that the topics covered are <br>  useful, and so as not to give the impression that this is all going under <br>  by a bank :) During this period, a system of criteria develops, <br>  encouraging people to contribute to the community - ‚Äúfinancial adequacy ratings‚Äù are some ... In general, I think it is understandable - a system of positive feedback is created so that adequate visitors develop the community. <br>  3. After some time has passed, some niche products are slowly and carefully introduced into this community.  Whose?  Bank (or banks), under which it all really goes. <br><br>  Those.  this is a kind of pocket banking site where banks get <br>  loyal audience.  Loyal because if people like the site (the information on it is the most important thing), then all that it will be <br>  to offer, people will also like it (by inertia). <br><br>  Approximate budget for the first half-year. <br><br>  One-time costs: <br>  - development of the site itself - a maximum of $ 2,000 (a-la Web 2.0) <br>  - advertising on the web - about $ 1'200 - buying banner-shows, etc. <br><br>  Monthly operation: <br>  - technical (website hosting) - $ 10 :) <br>  - staff (experts, avataring - type, first active <br>  visitors) - $ 2,500 - they work at a remote home, 5 people ... <br><br>  Perceived price - no idea :) for the project, which included: <br>  - a site with attendance of about 1,500 per day; <br>  - customized production process associated with this site <br>  (experts and people involved in filling). <br><br>  The most far-sighted may want to - after all, have their own <br>  A normal tool is much cheaper than removing a user‚Äôs ad. <br><br>  In general - like this.  As they say, RFC :) </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/8782/">https://habr.com/ru/post/8782/</a></p>
