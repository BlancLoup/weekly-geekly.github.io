  <section class="page js-page"><h1>The most depressed offices in the world</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Wired magazine held among its readers an interesting <a href="http://blog.wired.com/business/2007/10/enter-our-sadde.html">contest</a> for the most <i>depressive cubic</i> .  All people could send their photos with a brief description.  It's amazing how Americans can work in such conditions. <br><br>  According to the results of the voting, David Gunnels, an IT specialist from the University of Alabama, was recognized as the most unfortunate office poor.  His ‚Äúworkplace‚Äù, if you can call it this rat corner, is made as an extension to a massive cabinet with a card file in a windowless conference room next to a poorly ventilated toilet and microwave.  Behind the wall is parking with noisy cars.  The lamp on the ceiling does not work.  David's stepmother, who visited David, was so depressed by what she saw that she brought him a home floor lamp, so that the boy would not be completely blind. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/olpictures/4b1/5c4/94b/4b15c494b2fbfe7e633c428f83f3f3e8.jpg" width="385" height="289" hspace="10" vspace="10"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  2. When the office does not have enough jobs, normal firms send employees to remote operation.  But not every leader does this.  Some believe that places for a computer can always be found.  This unfortunate picture in the photo below did not even have a table.  He pulled the cabinet out of the documents room and hoisted the monitor right on it.

The depressed look of a young man in the photo speaks for itself, despite his thumbs raised upwards.  Just look at the size of his table, as well as the space under the table, where theoretically you need to put his feet. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/olpictures/8bf/3d2/046/8bf3d20465c9440063d562a04b76b5ea.jpg" width="450" height="337" hspace="10" vspace="10"><br><br>  4. Sales and marketers should work side by side.  The management of this company took the slogan too literally.  As a result, the two men share among themselves and so not very spacious cubic.  A weak fluorescent lamp one for two and inverted cardboard boxes add color.  No phone, no windows too. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/olpictures/90f/5fb/de2/90f5fbde2cf225f2f3124970f346ce3e.jpg" width="435" height="580" hspace="10" vspace="10"><br><br>  5. In Minnesota, winters are very cold, and the owner of this cubicle recalls this fact every time someone enters a room.  The door is literally a meter behind him. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/olpictures/a70/211/e25/a70211e252b3b56029bf15a4709eede3.jpg" width="450" height="337" hspace="10" vspace="10"><br><br>  6. You may think that all the office spaces in these photos are temporary.  They say that a person was put on a day or two, and he immediately begins to complain.  Maybe so, but nothing is more permanent than temporary.  In the photo below is a geek's workplace, for which he has been working for a year.  Right in the corner, on the aisle, like a doghouse.  People constantly walk behind them and conversations do not subside (the guy probably already knows all the office rumors).  Recently, his table began to be used to make coffee. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/olpictures/721/9b8/7b8/7219b87b8a91250d2d7e752cd3c6c974.jpg" width="450" height="337" hspace="10" vspace="10"><br><br>  7. If you are on the San Francisco marina, take a USS Pampanito submarine from the Second World War on an excursion.  When you see this tiny corner, measured in centimeters, you will not even realize right away that this was also someone's cubic. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/olpictures/c2e/ea0/6de/c2eea06de4db67956002afaf77f883af.jpg" width="450" height="337" hspace="10" vspace="10"><br><br>  8. This guy returned from the meeting and found that all the furniture had disappeared.  He sat on the only remaining chair and spent a whole hour there in woeful thoughts, until someone told him that his office had just been moved to another place. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/olpictures/677/2a8/b0d/6772a8b0dd5816e304149b7716dad4c1.jpg" width="450" height="335" hspace="10" vspace="10"><br><br>  9. The huge corporation, which is engaged in maritime freight and rolls millions of dollars, did not find anything better than to build a workplace for a contracted computer technician in a 15-meter steel cargo container.  To simply turn on the light in the morning, he pulls a 30-meter cable to the power substation.  In winter, he connects a small portable heater, so as not to die from the cold in this iron crypt.  There is nothing to say about the quality of GSM and WiFi reception. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/olpictures/83c/80f/924/83c80f924870508245a068ffa84cee29.jpg" width="318" height="580" hspace="10" vspace="10"><br><br>  10. In the photo below - a typical anthill of the cheapest and smallest cubicles you can think of. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/olpictures/ab8/4c5/0d3/ab84c50d374a20fe874d47ffdf00ee2b.jpg" width="450" height="337" hspace="10" vspace="10"><br><br>  11. When you look at this picture, the thought comes that the author is just a bad photographer, but he assures that the photo exactly conveys the lighting that is in his office.  More precisely, which is almost there. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/olpictures/cf1/8d6/9d1/cf18d69d124953999da7faaf5d6849b6.jpg" width="450" height="337" hspace="10" vspace="10"></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/15819/">https://habr.com/ru/post/15819/</a></p>
