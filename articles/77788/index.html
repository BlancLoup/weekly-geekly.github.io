  <section class="page js-page"><h1>GaGaGames as a source of all the best that is in the world of board games</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Get ready, now I will motivate you to get up from the computer, ring up friends, get together in the evening, pour something tasty into glasses (yes, the same tea, at least) and do one of the most pleasant things that you can engage with friends - board games.  Since associations of the first level are usually erroneous, we will still talk about board games, and not about what might have occurred to you a second ago. <br> <a href="http://gagagames.ru/"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/243/92e/7f1/24392e7f153e0da48e993c3488499141.jpg" alt="image"></a> <br><a name="habracut"></a><br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/a27/7c4/941/a277c4941083b9329e2fc57f8f002055.jpg"></a>  It so happened that we loved the board games.  As it turned out, this is a much more fascinating pastime than household drinking, watching TV or talking about anything (although this also has its pleasant sides). <br>  And we wanted that the pleasure of games was received not only by us, but by all, all-all, people in the Universe.  Well, for starters, at least in St. Petersburg. <br>  We sat down at the tables with games, picked up keyboards, cameras, phones, and set to work, the outcome of which was the board games store in St. Petersburg - <a href="http://gagagames.ru/">GaGaGames.ru</a> . <br><br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/ecf/b23/cb0/ecfb23cb0f49783d9ccb4a628bef440d.jpg"></a>  The process was not easy.  We played dozens of different games.  Some were interesting and exciting, some were not.  Some games took hold on the fly, while others had to sit for hours on the rules, but even then there were questions.  Finally, there were games that we liked to play, and there were others.  Of all these games, we have selected the best.  The criteria were different: high world rankings, awards, critical acclaim and ordinary players, and, in the end, our subjective opinion.  One thing is unchanged: for all these games we are not ashamed, and we believe that you will like any game presented in our store.  We are even sure of this.  We‚Äôre probably ready to eat our hats if you don‚Äôt like any of the games we‚Äôve selected.  Although, just in case, we don‚Äôt wear hats. <br><br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/319/197/b70/319197b70da36b99898dbade0eecb56e.jpg"></a>  Our mini-revolution in the industry of modern board games - you have the right to <a href="http://www.gagagames.ru/rent/">rent</a> any game: try, make your own opinion, but maybe you just want to play, and reluctant to keep boxes with all your favorite games at home.  And yes, nobody will offer you that anymore.  We are the only ones.
