      What criteria to use for evaluating the safety of instant messengers can be seen from fighters for digital immunity - <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronic_Frontier_Foundation">Electronic Frontier Foundation</a> (EFF).  By the way, the question is, are these criteria exhaustive or additional (for example, about masking metadata) needed? <br><br>  To increase the degree of objectivity and independence, please comment in the comments of those who understand the issue about the security of instant messengers. <br><br>  <b>Based on what data can you draw conclusions?</b> <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/55b/faf/59d/55bfaf59da824b0bb9a5afb8751ade5c.jpg"><br>  <i>Strategic Intelligence Information Work</i> Washington Platt <br><br>  <b>Electronic Frontier Foundation</b> <br>  <a href="https://www.eff.org/secure-messaging-scorecard">www.eff.org/secure-messaging-scorecard</a> <br><br>  The Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF) has published a serious analytical material (last updated 2015-11-03), assessing the degree of security and privacy of mobile and online messengers.  EFF awarded points to the participants, evaluating the applications by seven parameters. <br><br><ol><li>  Is the data encrypted during transmission? </li><li>  Is the data protected from reading by service providers? </li><li>  Can the user verify the identity of his interlocutor? </li><li>  Is the correspondence history protected from decryption when intercepting the current key (this question implies that the encryption key must change constantly, and the keys used are safely deleted along with the random data on which they were built)? </li><li>  Is the solution code open? </li><li>  Are the encryption methods described in detail? </li><li>  Has an independent security audit been conducted in the last 12 months? </li></ol><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">More about the criteria in English</b> <div class="spoiler_text">  METHODOLOGY <br><br>  Here are the criteria for various communication tools. <br><br>  <b>1. Is your communication encrypted in transit?</b> <br><br>  This criterion requires that all user communications are encrypted.  If you‚Äôre not interested in a network connection, it‚Äôs not recommended.  We do not require that metadata (such as user names or addresses) is encrypted. <br><br>  <b>2. Is your communication encrypted with a key the provider doesn‚Äôt have access to?</b> <br><br>  This criterion requires that all user communications are end-to-end encrypted.  It means that it will be generated and stored at the endpoints (ie by users, not by servers).  Endpoints but it is not necessary to end the keys or synchronize the keys between two devices.  It is fine if users have public keys are exchanged using a centralized server. <br><br>  <b>3. Can you verify your identity with identity?</b> <br><br>  It is a criterion that has been compromised.  Two acceptable solutions are: <br><br>  There are no translations available. <br><br>  A key exchange protocol with a short-authentication-string comparison, such as the Socialist Millionaire's protocol. <br><br>  Other solutions are possible between the users and the cryptographic channel.  For the scorecard, we are simply not evaluating the security of that mechanism. <br><br>  <b>4. Are your communications secure if your keys are stolen?</b> <br><br>  This is a criterion that requires it to be encrypted with the ephemeral keys.  It is imperative that these keys can be reconstructed.  Note that this criterion requires criterion 2, end-to-end encryption. <br><br>  Note: For example: TLS with a Diffie-Hellman cipher suite) and non-forward-secret end-to-end encryption plus an explicit guarantee that you are not logged by the provider.  It is not a cessation of secrecy at all. <br><br>  <b>5. Is the code open to independent review?</b> <br><br>  This criterion requires that it can be independently compiled.  Although it is preferable to be a license.  This is a case in point: backlash, back doors, structural problems.  Note: When the tools are used, it is not a complete OS.  This is a compromise, but it‚Äôs beyond the scope of this project. <br><br>  <b>6. Is the crypto design well-documented?</b> <br><br>  This criterion requires clear application.  This is a white paper written by the audience of professional cryptographers.  This must provide answers to the following questions: <br><br>  What are the algorithms and parameters (such as key sizes or elliptic curve groups)? <br><br>  How keys are generated, stored, and exchanged between users <br><br>  Their key <br><br>  This is a clear statement about what the model aims to provide.  This should also be a clear statement. <br><br>  <b>7. Has there been an independent security audit?</b> <br><br>  This criterion requires an independent review.  This is a review of the instrument of the development team.  Audits by an independent security team within a large organization are sufficient.  It is not a problem. <br>  [ <a href="https://www.eff.org/secure-messaging-scorecard">source</a> ] <br></div></div><br><br>  Top list of the most protected instant messengers according to EFF: <br><br><ul><li>  <a href="https://chatsecure.org/about/">Chatsecure</a> is a free open source iOS and Android messaging application with encryption support.  The developer is the Guardian Project.  The messenger complies with all the necessary parameters proposed by the EFF, guaranteeing the highest degree of security and privacy (but only if used with the Tor-based Torb plugin). </li><li>  <a href="https://crypto.cat/">CryptoCat</a> is an open encryption messenger that works with Chrome, Firefox, Safari and Opera browsers, as well as a separate service on Apple OS X and on the iPhone.  This summer, the developers of CryptoCat were looking for sponsors to develop the Android version and create an encrypted video chat - perhaps soon a ‚Äúcryptoclot‚Äù will appear on this platform. </li><li>  <a href="https://whispersystems.org/">Signal, RedPhone and Textsecure</a> are Whisper Systems' products, designed, respectively, for messaging on iOS devices, making confidential calls from Android devices and chatting between Android users.  Each of the applications is open source and offers full encryption of data transfer and storage. </li><li>  Silent Phone and Silent Text are secure call and messaging services from <a href="https://silentcircle.com/">Silent Circle</a> .  Of course, they are paid, but they are compatible with iOS and Android platforms, and also work on traditional PCs.  Silent Circle has also developed its own model of a penetration-proof smartphone based on a modified Android build called Blackphone.  Corporate support is also offered. </li><li>  <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telegram_(%25D0%25BC%25D0%25B5%25D1%2581%25D1%2581%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B4%25D0%25B6%25D0%25B5%25D1%2580)">Telegram</a> is a free cross-platform messenger that allows you to exchange messages and media files.  The system uses a proprietary server part that runs on the facilities of several hosting companies in the USA and Germany, and several open source clients (under the GNU GPL).  For the messenger, MTProto protocol was created, which implies the use of several encryption protocols.  When authorizing and authenticating, RSA-2048, DH-2048 algorithms are used for encryption, and when sending protocol messages to the network, they are encrypted with AES with a key known to the client and the server.  Also used cryptographic hash sum SHA-1 and MD5. </li><li>  <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pidgin">Pidgin</a> is a multi-protocol, open-source IM client with support for Jabber, AIM, ICQ,

What tools to solve it (exclude from the system centralized servers or something else) I propose to discuss in the comments. <br><hr><br>  <b>UPD</b> <br>  <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/users/ru_crypt/" class="user_link">ru_crypt</a> : <br><blockquote>  ‚ÄúThe latest results from the analysis of the MTProto protocol: <a href="http://eprint.iacr.org/2015/1177.pdf">eprint.iacr.org/2015/1177.pdf</a> .  This paper shows that this protocol is not persistent in the IND-CCA model, i.e.  It is possible to convert any ciphertext to some other ciphertext that can be decrypted into the plaintext source.  Despite the fact that the attack is theoretical, the authors recommend not to use self-made solutions, but to implement well-tested designs, and they suggest changing the protocol so that the attack does not take place. ‚Äù </blockquote><br><br>  <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/users/valdikss/" class="user_link">ValdikSS</a> : <br><blockquote>  ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt like Telegram, but, in general, it is definitely better than other popular messengers, at least because there is an opportunity to make an encrypted chat with a more or less normal matching of the key fingerprint, but for normal chat, only the transport is protected, as well as , in fact, the majority of other popular messengers, and the media, for the most part, describe Telegram as a super secure solution that even terrorists use, so you, like, will definitely do it.  I consider such an exaggeration on the part of the media to be quite a big problem, no kidding, because  Such news attracts many technically illiterate new users to Telegram.  If in the same Tor security is built architecturally, then the security of the correspondence of illiterate Telegram users rests only on the principles of developers about data disclosure and physical security of servers, and in the case of compromise, not only the users themselves suffer, but you too, if you corresponded with the user, the data which, for example, was given to government organizations. ‚Äù </blockquote><br><br>  <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/users/zhovner/" class="user_link">zhovner</a> : <br><blockquote>  ‚ÄúThis topic is much bigger than all of us, because such important technology for humanity as IM and audio-video calls cannot be managed by one company.  There are all sorts of work groups supporting industry-critical libraries and programs, such as openssl, apache.  I think some IETF should do this. <br>  It‚Äôs just that at some point they squander this and open standards didn‚Äôt manage to do commercial work.  The fact that IM is now monopolized by companies is terrible.  Ideally, all instant messengers should maintain a unified minimum standard sufficient to communicate with anyone, like email, and all of their branded pieces to be implemented within the network for their users. <br>  Imagine that emails could only be sent between outlook, but you can‚Äôt go to gmail anymore.  Or you could only call from Nokia to Nokia, but not to Samsung.  This is exactly what the messengers look like right now. ‚Äù </blockquote><br><br>  <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/users/j_o_k_e_r/" class="user_link">J_o_k_e_R</a> : <br><blockquote>  ‚ÄúThe most obvious and obvious file telegram: centralized servers.  Take the ass those who manage them - and everything.  No telegraph.  Even if no one read my correspondence in the past. <br><br>  This file follows from a slightly less obvious file - the closeness of the source code of the servers. ‚Äù </blockquote></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/273001/">https://habr.com/ru/post/273001/</a></p>
