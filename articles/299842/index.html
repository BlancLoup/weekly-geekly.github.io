      I watch this film regularly, because it always - even when it seems that things are hopeless - gives me the incentive needed to continue working. <br><br><h3>  <font color="#0071c5">2) <a href="http://www.kinopoisk.ru/film/6034/">‚Äú</a> The Secret Life of Walter Mitty‚Äù</font> </h3><br>  Yes, I know that Ben Stiller confirms his bad reputation from time to time.  But honestly, it seems to me that in this film he is really good.  See how disgruntled Walter is going out of work and going on a journey.  Literally. <br><br>  Perhaps the plot is not so deep, but I think it will add a few drops of superb carelessness to this motivating mix. <br><br><h3>  <font color="#0071c5">3) <a href="http://www.kinopoisk.ru/film/260162/">"</a> Dallas Buyers Club" ("Dallas Buyers Club")</font> </h3><br>  In my opinion, Matthew McConaughey, who plays Ron Woodruff, shows the social side of an unhealthy lifestyle.  The hero has AIDS and goes from drug trafficking to helping a whole group of people dying from the disease. <br><br>  He seeks to show what can be done when something terrible falls on you. <br>  Matthew's game really deserved an Oscar. <br><br><h3>  <font color="#0071c5">4) <a href="http://www.kinopoisk.ru/film/448/">"Forrest Gump"</a> ("Forrest Gump")</font> </h3><br>  Although the story is invented, I see Forrest Gampa as an inspiring character who teaches people to live, acting as if they always have only one attempt.  Tom Hanks brilliantly embodies this when his hero goes to war, falls in love, faces disappointment (several times), plays ping-pong and runs a whole year without stopping. <br><br>  And you know what?  People call Forrest backward and dull.  And I would say that he just knows how to block the surrounding noise and do what he wants.  A peculiar, but <a href="http://blog.mbaconsult.ru/blog/personal/5-urokov-zhizni-iz-filosofii/">useful philosophy</a> . <br><br><h3>  <font color="#0071c5">5) <a href="http://www.kinopoisk.ru/film/462515/">"Life is beautiful"</a> ("50/50")</font> </h3><br>  Joseph Gordon-Levitt and Seth Rogen!  But no.  This is no ordinary film about male friendship. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/4a7/047/1a4/4a70471a4c3741b990aeea5e6afe249b.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Levitt plays Adam Lerner, a young man with cancer.  Watch how he struggles with his illness with the support of his best friend, who seems to be eager only to use him to meet girls;  terrible girlfriend, with a delay bringing him to the chemistry;  and the great buddies who appeared during his chemotherapy sessions. <br><br>  I find the film inspirational because it shows how people react differently to cancer.  You will find out who really surrounds you. <br><br><h3>  <font color="#0071c5">6) <a href="http://www.kinopoisk.ru/film/450213/">‚Äú</a> The Blind Side‚Äù</font> </h3><br>  A homeless black teenager cannot build a relationship with life until two guys take him to their company.  The heroine of Sandra Bullock delightfully demonstrates how serious support can form or destroy human life. <br><br><h3>  <font color="#0071c5">7) <a href="http://www.kinopoisk.ru/film/6123/">‚Äú</a> Patch Adams‚Äù</font> </h3><br>  I got to a marathon movie with Robbie Williams after his death.  This tape stood out. <br>  Healer Adams is a disgruntled doctor, tired of the system.  He throws a career to help those in need.  One person can really make huge changes if he wants to. <br><br><h3>  <font color="#0071c5">8) <a href="http://www.kinopoisk.ru/film/539/">"</a> Good Will Hunting"</font> </h3><br>  Matt Damon plays the role of Will Hunting, a completely self-contained genius.  Strictly speaking, he has emotional problems.  He pushes people away, which prevents him from <a href="http://blog.mbaconsult.ru/blog/personal/7-shagov-navstrechu-svoim-tselyam/">realizing his full potential</a> . <br><br>  This film seems to me inspiring, because it shows that everyone has problems, and everyone suffers from their own complexes.  But with a little help, we can go far. <br><br>  Moreover.  We are just people.  Therefore, everything is fine.  But push yourself and strive for what you want.  Yes, and Robbie Williams plays the therapist who manages to reach Will. <br><br><h3>  <font color="#0071c5">9) <a href="http://www.kinopoisk.ru/film/662149/">"The Treasure Hunters"</a> ("The Monuments Men")</font> </h3><br><blockquote>  ‚ÄúYou can destroy an entire generation, level their houses with the land, but they will somehow find a way back.  But if you destroy their history, their achievements, it turns out that they never existed.  That‚Äôs what Hitler wants, and that‚Äôs what we‚Äôre fighting for. ‚Äù </blockquote><br>  - Frank Stokes by George Clooney <br><br>  This quote fully captures the essence of the film.  We all chase in life for the same superficial things.  And only a few stop to think and evaluate high. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/38e/8a0/b4a/38e8a0b4a3774b4ea991f2f76b1a8349.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Encouraging the knowledge that some are willing to fight for it. <br><br><h3>  <font color="#0071c5">10) <a href="http://www.kinopoisk.ru/film/397494/">"District No. 9"</a> ("District 9")</font> </h3><br>  This may not be the traditional inspirational movie, but I decided to include it in the list because it is one of my favorite films. <br><br>  What is he talking about?  About aliens.  They landed on Earth and live next to us.  Humanity and aliens are trying to coexist alongside.  But the people here are bad guys. <br><br>  Why is this tape inspiring?  It makes you think.  If one day you feel like a bad guy, perhaps this is a signal: it's time to take a step and change something.  Not all external forces invade your life.  Plus, here is a very touching ending. <br><br><h3>  <font color="#0071c5">11) <a href="http://www.kinopoisk.ru/film/423210/">‚ÄúThree Idiots‚Äù</a> (‚Äú3 Idiots‚Äù)</font> </h3><br>  People call three friends idiots.  But they did everything to do what they loved and <a href="http://blog.mbaconsult.ru/blog/personal/kak-pravilno-vybrat-klyuchevye-aspekty-zhizni-dlya-togo-chtoby-vkladyvat-v-nikh-energiyu-i-vremya/">made their dreams come true</a> . <br><br>  I do not think that many have heard about this film.  But it must be looked at.  It will make you think about how education is given today. <br><br><h3>  <font color="#0071c5">12) <a href="http://www.kinopoisk.ru/film/518037/">‚Äú</a> Lo imposible‚Äù</font> </h3><br>  Love your family.  Treasure your life.  What else can I say? <br><br><h3>  <font color="#0071c5">13) <a href="http://www.kinopoisk.ru/film/102260/">"42"</a></font> </h3><br>  The story of Jackie Robinson, the first black player in Major League Baseball.  See how he overcame inequality. <br><br><h3>  <font color="#0071c5">14) <a href="http://www.kinopoisk.ru/film/361/">"Fight Club"</a> ("Fight Club")</font> </h3><br>  The film is much deeper than it seems.  Tyler Darden - the hero of Brad Pitt - inspires his friend, a nameless character, played by Edward Norton.  He makes him stop obeying and teaches to live without the shackles created by work and property. <br><blockquote>  "Only having lost everything, we become free" </blockquote><br>  - Tyler <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/c9a/050/b41/c9a050b4113c4eb190bf1fb20d0466e8.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  One of the best quotes of the film.  Review it again and again, and every time you will find something new in it.  Yes, and for the first time, be prepared for an unexpected plot twist. <br><br><h3>  <font color="#0071c5">15) <a href="http://www.kinopoisk.ru/film/391772/">‚ÄúAlways say‚Äú yes ‚Äù‚Äù</a> (‚ÄúYes Man‚Äù)</font> </h3><br>  Another unusual spiritual film! <br>  Funny and eccentric hero Jim Carrey agrees to literally everything. <br>  Perhaps you should open up, stop doing old boring chores and grab the opportunity while there is still time. <br><br>  PS We recommend another article on the topic - <a href="http://blog.mbaconsult.ru/blog/personal/10-udivitelnykh-urokov-liderstva-i-komandnoy-raboty-pozaimstvovannye-iz-dzhaza/">10 amazing lessons of leadership and teamwork, borrowed from jazz</a> . <br><br>  Translated by Vyacheslav Davidenko, founder of <a href="http://www.mbaconsult.ru/">MBA Consult</a> . </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/299842/">https://habr.com/ru/post/299842/</a></p>
