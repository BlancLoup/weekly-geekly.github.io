Version 1.1</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  The site has a lot of posts about what conditions need to be included in the contract for the creation of sites and programs (a short list below), but there is no contract in a format that can be taken as a basis for drawing up your contract.  We studied the conditions of the posts (thanks to the authors), thought about them, reworked them and took into account the form of a contract offered to your court.  So the contract so far can be considered partially "zahabrenny." <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/3b2/c32/d4a/3b2c32d4a96efad20582ae2d6b3ffe1b.jpg"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Fulfilling the earlier promise of <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/173265/">habrahabr.ru/post/173265</a> , we take the trouble to finalize the contract on the comments and suggestions in the comments.  In the case of successful collaboration, the contract can be considered ‚ÄúHacked.‚Äù <br><br>  If the positions on a specific condition are not exemplary, then in the contract there will be 2 variants of one condition.  Everyone will be able to choose according to their interest.
