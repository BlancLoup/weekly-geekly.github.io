Initially, I made a note in my blog, then I decided to publish here, because the described technique does not have a specific binding to the type of resource. <br><br>  Came across an interesting site, <a href="http://meettheboss.tv/">MeetTheBoss.tv</a> .  The resource posted interviews with business leaders.  And the leaders to whom MeetTheBoss.tv pays attention are really business sharks, experienced players.  For example, you can watch / listen to interviews with Adidas president Herbert Hainer, head of Rolls-Royce Motor Cars Tom Purves, chief techie of Amazon Werner Voegels.  The Free icon on the Register button attracted attention (rarely this kind of content in the English-language network is distributed free of charge), but did not want to register right away.  However, an attempt to view one of the interviews revealed the urgent need for registration: the site gave only the trailer recordings, strongly urging to get to know each other better. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a>

      The interest was quite large, and I went to register.  Three steps of registration were indicated, which in itself is unusual - today people don‚Äôt want to register, and if you have to fill many fields, no, thank you.  However, in the first step, there were very few fields; moreover, the three steps, coupled with the general entourage of the site, gave a certain sense of seriousness to the whole process.  It seems like we don‚Äôt have toys here, so check in as an adult.  The second step was a little surprised: it was suggested to recommend MeetTheBoss.tv to a friend.  On the screen - the relevant fields (your address, the recipient's address, the text of the letter (already filled out, but editable), etc.).  Here are the options to post a link to the site on Twitter or facebook, instead of sending a recommendation to one person via email.  Not a word more about any data for your profile.  Only recommendations.  And everything is arranged as this step will be - absolutely obligatory, registration without it will not take place.  There is a Cancel button under the form, but it is painted in a frightening gray, and there is no desire to click on it.  In addition, the first step has already been taken, what really stop.  I filled out the fields, sent (to myself, nothing else came to mind) recommendation, clicked the appropriate button to continue registration, and was in the third step.  They didn‚Äôt have to fill in anything at all - the system notified me of a successful registration, announced that I was logged in, and offered to enjoy all the benefits of such a legal status.  Everything. <br><br>  In fact, I signed up at the very first step.  On the second, he acted as a ‚Äúvolunteer‚Äù in the MeetTheBoss.tv promotion.  The third step is a chimera in general, but when you are at the first, you do not know this, and the magic number 3, as noted above, looks serious. <br><br>  Moral: a person is not so difficult to push for him to recommend your site.  The MeetTheBoss.tv example shows that this is a technical matter. <br><br>  - via <a href="http://shopolog.ru/">shopolog</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/85356/">https://habr.com/ru/post/85356/</a></p>
