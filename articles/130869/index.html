      Under the cat a small description of the next functions in the queue and the problems encountered. <br><br>  The client works through the official API, respectively, authorization is implemented through the built-in browser. <br><br>  <b>Source</b> <br>  Source code and xap file can be found at: <br>  <a href="http://vkontaktewp.codeplex.com/releases/view/75456">http://vkontaktewp.codeplex.com/releases/view/75456</a> <br><br>  <b>Expected features:</b> <br>  Soon the following functionalities will be added: <br><br>  ProgressBar is one of the smallest and yet the most necessary function - an indicator of the process of downloading content. <br>  Pin to start - now almost all pages can be fixed on the main page, if possible we plan to add different styling for each page. <br>  Saving contacts is an easy-to-implement, but sometimes very necessary function (I apologize for taftology :) saving a contact from VKontakte to the contact list on the phone. <br>  Navigation - at the moment the navigation is not quite correctly built.  The Home button on each page was intended to enable the transition to the root page when opening an application from pinned icons.  In theory, this button should be displayed only if we moved from the pinned icon.  At the moment, the implementation of this function was impossible due to problems with AppBar (described below).  I was not sure how correct it is to leave it as it is now.  It might be better to disable the transition to the main one in general than to always show these buttons. <br><br>  In the future, it is supposed to add the ability to comment on photos, add new ones, support ‚Äúwall of messages‚Äù, etc.  etc.  as required. <br><br>  <b>Problems with the code:</b> <br>  The code itself also has an uncountable set of flaws and flaws. <br>  <i>I just want to warn you that the code is far from ideal, it has refactored many times, in some places there are copy-pastes, in some places it is not optimal, in some places it violates the MVVM principle, but nevertheless decided to post it as it is.</i> <br><br>  Error handling is the main problem that is currently underdeveloped - partially implemented error handling.  For example, the authorization error is processed correctly, but at the same time, the application now crashes when there is no network connection, which is not good, to say the least. <br><br>  AppBar is another significant problem that needs to be fixed now.  This is the famous, infamous problem with data binding to AppBar - any data binding attempt results in an exception. <br>  The second problem with the same AppBar is related to the fact that the buttons in the AppBar do not have the IsVisible property - i.e.  just take and hide the button will not work.  In another project, this problem was solved by the own implementation of ApplicationBar - here, most likely, there will also be the same solution. <br><br>  The code has changed many times, some things have remained "in inheritance".  For example, the DataLayer assembly, intended for storing data in the cache, for offline operation, is currently disabled, the code is almost cleaned, and this assembly is not used.  On the other hand, the ‚Äúinherited‚Äù code is not so much in fact. <br><br>  <b>PS</b> <br>  <b>Report / detailed article</b> <br>  I would like to write an article or make a report on the development of applications for WP7, as always, stops the unknown about the target audience.  On the one hand, one does not want to tire with banalities, on the other hand, one does not want to miss important details.  I would welcome any suggestions / questions / comments, which later could help to highlight the emphasis in the article / report. <br><br>  <b>Pps</b> <br>  To the merging karma, I don‚Äôt care how much karma will remain, just to be able to write, it would just be interesting to find out what caused dissatisfaction - can the writing style or errors in the article, errors in the code? <br><br>  <b>PPPS</b> <br>  I posted several screenshots of <a href="http://vkontaktewp.codeplex.com/">http://vkontaktewp.codeplex.com/</a> .  A little later I will try to make your home page more decently. </habracut></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/130869/">https://habr.com/ru/post/130869/</a></p>
