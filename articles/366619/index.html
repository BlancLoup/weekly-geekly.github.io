      The list is not sorted by either the release date or alphabetically.  I just wrote them out as they go on my list of <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/overcast-podcast-player/id888422857%3Fmt%3D8">Overcast</a> subscriptions. <br><br>  I also do not want to sort it by rating or anything else.  But, of course, you can consider that I [in absentia] like what is represented here, because I have been listening to other works of these people for some time. <br><br>  <b><a href="https://itunes.apple.com/de/podcast/accidental-tech-podcast/id617416468%3Fmt%3D2">Accidental Tech Podcast:</a></b> Marco Arment (Marco Arment), Casey Liss and John Siracusa discuss all weekly (mostly Apple-related) technical news on the latest topics every week. <br><br>  <b><a href="https://itunes.apple.com/de/podcast/the-critical-path/id442816705%3Fmt%3D2">The Critical Path:</a></b> Yes, another Apple-oriented podcast.  But Horace Dediu [Horace Dediu] [one of Apple‚Äôs largest independent analysts] keeps the bar and doesn‚Äôt look like an Apple fan, talking about recent developments in the mobile device market. <br><br>  <b><a href="https://itunes.apple.com/de/podcast/debug/id578812394%3Fmt%3D2">Debug:</a></b> His hosts are Guy English and Rene Ritchie.  Debug delves into software development topics, but information is provided at an easy and understandable level. <br><br>  <b><a href="https://itunes.apple.com/de/podcast/how-to-start-a-startup/id922398209%3Fmt%3D2">How To Start A Startup:</a></b> Stanford University this semester offers its students a course to which they invite entrepreneurs from all over the world, including, for example, Dustin Moskovitz.  For those of us who are not part of the Ivy League, these lectures are published in the form of a free podcast series. <br><br>  <b><a href="https://itunes.apple.com/de/podcast/iterate/id447063932%3Fmt%3D2">Iterate:</a></b> Renee Ritchie, Marc Edwards (Marc Edwards) and Seth Clifford regularly talk about the entire application development process, covering everything that happens along the way: from design to implementation and testing. <br><br>  <b><a href="https://itunes.apple.com/de/podcast/jobs-to-be-done-radio/id499859427%3Fmt%3D2">Jobs-to-be-Done Radio:</a></b> I really like the metaphor: ‚ÄúJobs-to-be-done‚Äù [the concept of ‚Äúwork‚Äù that a product or service ‚Äúperforms‚Äù], and therefore I simply have to listen to this podcast.  Moderators: Bob Moesta and Chris Spiek. <br><br>  <b><a href="https://itunes.apple.com/de/podcast/dorm-room-tycoon/id355125543%3Fmt%3D2">Dorm Room Tycoon:</a></b> Excellent interviews with the founders of startups about their difficulties.  William Channer has already met with such famous people as Joshua Topolsky, Patrick Collision and Cameron Moll on his show. <br><br>  <b><a href="https://itunes.apple.com/de/podcast/mvp/id918020905%3Fmt%3D2">MVP:</a></b> Former AOL Journalists, Ryan Block and Peter Rojas recently revived their attempts to record podcasts, created this new show and enthusiastically talk about ‚Äúgeek themes‚Äù from a ‚Äúnon-journalistic‚Äù point of view. <br><br>  <b><a href="https://itunes.apple.com/de/podcast/startup-podcast/id913805339%3Fmt%3D2">StartUp Podcast:</a></b> I already mentioned this podcast when I talk about my favorite shows in the latest Weekly Favorites, but I just have to recommend it again.  The most recent review contained audio recordings that both founders made independently of each other along with their wives, and hid it from each other for several months. <br><br>  <b><a href="https://itunes.apple.com/de/podcast/neunetzcast/id487652919%3Fmt%3D2">neunetzcast (German):</a></b> Discussions on the topic of technology from Marcel Weiss (Marcel Weiss), which mainly focuses on one or two topics, instead of trying to fit all the technical events of a week or month in one episode. <br><br>  <b><a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/the-rocketship-podcast/id808014240">The Rocketship Podcast:</a></b> Excellent job interviews with entrepreneurs about product launches (ideally directly about income), from Joelle Steiniger, Matt Goldman, and Michael Sacca. <br><br>  <b><a href="https://itunes.apple.com/de/podcast/pragmatic/id765842433%3Fmt%3D2">Pragmatic:</a></b> ‚ÄúPragmatic is a weekly show about the practical aspects of technology.‚Äù  Presenter - John Chidgey. <br><br>  <b><a href="https://itunes.apple.com/de/podcast/release-notes/id650358643%3Fmt%3D2">Release Notes:</a></b> What makes the Release Notes a bit different is the emphasis on independent development, instead of the usual chatter about technology.  Charles Perry and Joe Cieplinski really bring something new to their podcast. <br><br>  <b><a href="https://itunes.apple.com/de/podcast/the-talk-show-with-john-gruber/id528458508%3Fmt%3D2">The Talk Show:</a></b> You can consider that this podcast, the creator and presenter of which is John Gruber, is the one that you should listen to in matters of Apple technology. <br><br>  <b><a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/successful-users/id890672253">Successful Users:</a></b> Samuel Hulick and Robert Graham (Robert Graham) communicate on all topics related to attracting users and optimizing the conversion, not taking themselves too seriously. <br><br>  <b><a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/product-hunt/id862714883%3Fmt%3D2">Product Hunt Radio:</a></b> If you love <a href="http://www.producthunt.com/">Product Hunt</a> , you will probably also want to hear its founder interviewing the creators of startups and technology journalists from around the world on the latest news from our industry. <br><br>  <b><a href="https://itunes.apple.com/de/podcast/nyrd-radio/id919615842%3Fmt%3D2">NYRD Radio:</a></b> Alexis Ohanian [co-founder of Reddit] finally started recording his own podcast and the first two episodes immediately made us demand to continue.
