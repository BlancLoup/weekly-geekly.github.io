Thousands of independent <a href="https://bugcrowd.com/">Bugcrowd</a> researchers will work to identify potential vulnerabilities that Bugcrowd will sort, manifest, and then provide to the Dash Core team for correction. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  At first, the process will be conducted in a closed mode - access will be available only to specialists by invitation, and then it will be transformed into a public program when the next release of Dash Evolution is ready for launch. <br><br>  ‚ÄúOur goal is to become a safer and more secure payment network,‚Äù says Jim Bersch, creator of the budget proposals, Dashincubator and Bugcrowd.  ‚ÄúIt's about money - the digital equivalent of real cash.  Significant amounts of digital money generate a powerful incentive for thieves to become more active globally. <br><br>  This Dash project is similar to the creation of a bank vault with the subsequent invitation of ‚Äúrobbers of elite banks‚Äù to participate in the design of its defense, so that it subsequently could not be robbed by other criminals. ‚Äù

      ‚ÄúAs the Dash cryptocurrency is developing dynamically and attracting more and more attention, the identification and timely elimination of vulnerabilities is absolutely necessary,‚Äù said RAO Dash Core CEO Dyan Taylor.  ‚ÄúBug finders are a fresh look at the code, and it ensures that‚Äú white ‚Äùhackers can help identify any flaws in our security system.  Providing strong incentives to engage experienced programmers is one of many tools we have to ensure maximum reliability of the Dash code base. ‚Äù <br><br>  More than 60,000 different researchers are now participating in Bugcrowd.  On average, in two weeks of their work, they discover about five critical vulnerabilities, 70 unique vulnerabilities and 200 global vulnerabilities. <br><br>  ‚ÄúThere is currently a huge shortage of cybersecurity experts,‚Äù said Casey Ellis, CEO of Bugcrowd.  ‚ÄúMatch this with an expanding set of attack vectors, and you will understand why companies are at a disadvantage in terms of security.‚Äù <br><br>  ‚ÄúWe have accumulated a solid resource of professional researchers and many years of experience managing very complex programs.  We live in the era of digital transformations, and cryptocurrency is the next stage in this evolution.  Given globalization and the distribution of labor, it is reasonable to assume that demand for cryptocurrency will grow. ‚Äù <br><br>  Ryan Taylor from the Dash Core team is confident that this project will help improve the product that is currently under development. <br><br>  ‚ÄúOur landmark upcoming release, Dash Evolution, aims to completely rethink the operation of the digital currency, and it will be available for alpha testing as early as December 2017. It demonstrates how the optimization of user experience requires significant changes in the underlying technologies.  The more improvements Dash brings to the original Bitcoin code on which Dash is based, the closer we get to the fact that our product will meet the highest standards.  Since digital currencies contain great value and facilitate remittances, it is extremely important to take all possible measures to be absolutely sure that all, even minor software errors have been identified. ‚Äù <br><br>  ‚ÄúRegardless of their size, organizations trying to independently identify vulnerabilities in their software quickly realize that this is a very difficult task,‚Äù says Mr. Ellis.  ‚ÄúIdentifying problem areas, determining access levels, creating a vulnerability management program, and even setting deadlines for resolving problems within this program ‚Äî all this takes time and resources both when the program is launched and on an ongoing basis as it develops.  By choosing Bugcrowd to manage the search for bugs, the Dash team has separated its work from this process, so all they see is the results. ‚Äù </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/335196/">https://habr.com/ru/post/335196/</a></p>
