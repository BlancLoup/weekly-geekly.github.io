  <section class="page js-page"><h1>I will give the project in good hands</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Good day,% username.  Not hello, because the post is a little sad, namely, a tired "good afternoon."  Today I would like to ask your help.  If you still believe in the future of the Windows Phone platform, as I believed a year ago, then you might be interested in my project.  I feel only disappointment.  And yes, a small clarification, this is not a project like ‚ÄúI am promoting‚Äù, it‚Äôs rather ‚ÄúI was disappointed‚Äù and ‚Äúraise the flag for those who still believe.‚Äù  And now, if you allow a small introduction. <br><br>  Last year, I bought my wife a gift phone on Windows Phone.  While setting up the phone, inevitably imbued with the beauty of the system.  Everything is bright, beautiful and very succinctly.  The problem was that at that time (in general, and at the moment, too) there were no adequate resources in Russian devoted to programs under WP7.5. <br><br>  Picking around among applications, I armed myself with a rating from Gizmodo and riveted <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/136581/">Habratopic</a> about the best applications for the platform.  Since I had a gift domain from one of the hosters, then, according to the results of the topic, I riveted a small website <a href="http://bestwp7apps.ru/">bestWP7apps.ru</a> , where I posted a description of the applications.  It was assumed that once a month I will review the rating and add / change some applications.  This, I repeat, was in February of this year.  Those.  almost 9 months ago.  My grumbling hasn't scared you off yet,% username?  Then I ask under the cat. <a name="habracut"></a>
      <br>
        <script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>
        <ins class="adsbygoogle"
          style="display:block; text-align:center;"
          data-ad-layout="in-article"
          data-ad-format="fluid"
          data-ad-client="ca-pub-6974184241884155"
          data-ad-slot="8945601208"></ins>
        <script>
          (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
        </script>
      <br>
      So for a couple of months I really did it.  The problem is that the rating has hardly changed.  Those.  the number of really good applications practically did not grow.  Accordingly, there is no need to make changes.  As the poor reader FB2 READER was the best for the platform, it remained so.  And this, I repeat, with its absolute wretchedness. <br><br>  Further more - Gizmodo stopped keeping its rating, focusing on iOS and Android.  And then the amazing thing happened - Microsoft threw current users with an upgrade to Windows 8. Moreover, it turned out that the only available update (which is 7.8) by and large will differ only by changing the size of the icons on the desktop.  This is happiness. <br><br>  To be honest, I did not believe it to the last.  Even the <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/143645/">post</a> in the heat of the day wrote, they say, not figs to speculate, they can not update.  The post was fairly zaminusovan, in the comments made reasonable arguments, but I was blind.  But the presentation put everything in its place.  In essence, Microsoft doesn‚Äôt care about those 2 under-users who walk with their phones.  This is not the goal to which the corporation is headed.  In fact, 2 percent is a statistical error and can be started from scratch.  Actually, yesterday‚Äôs presentation confirms this - many words were said about Windows Phone 8 and not a word about Windows Phone 7.8.  In other words, there are no users with a platform below WP8.  Cool!  Adnroid can count on at least one update. <br><br>  Now back to the site.  As already mentioned, I have not updated it for a long time, although there is nothing special to update there.  The site still comes about 30 people a day.  The resource even has some pagerank.  I don‚Äôt want to sell a domain, I still didn‚Äôt have enough to be taken by some optimizers.  Therefore, I am ready to give the project in good hands to anyone who wants to breathe life into it.  Take who wants.  At the same time, there is one very fundamental point (for which, I probably deservedly get a minus) - I don‚Äôt want to give it away for free.  Therefore, I ask for a symbolic 100 rubles, as a kind of filter that cuts off those who just want a freebie.  We will assume that it is you who treat me to a cup of coffee.  Well, or we will agree, if only the project was useful to someone. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/156719/">https://habr.com/ru/post/156719/</a></p>
