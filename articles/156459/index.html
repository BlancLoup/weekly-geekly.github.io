  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Corporate portal to help HR</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Intranet, the company's internal corporate network, provides unique opportunities for an HR specialist.  It is an effective tool for shaping the necessary corporate attributes, ranging from the implementation of corporate standards to the management of information channels and business processes. <br><br>  Of particular need for a portal are, as a rule, large organizations with regional, and in some cases, international representations.  But, unfortunately, not all managers of such companies are sure of this need.  It is then that the most difficult task for an HR specialist arises, how to convince the boss of the effectiveness of using this tool. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  In this article I will describe the real experience of creating a corporate portal in a large holding company.  This duty fell heavily on the shoulders of my colleague, who at the time was the director of the HR department.  Due to some circumstances, we will not disclose the name of the company, all of a sudden some of the respected readers will have to work there.

      <b>Cheerful beginning</b> <br><br>  We omit the part of the description that is devoted to the goals, choice of the portal, the stage of preparation and implementation, since  in our article they play a minor role.  In return, I propose to dwell on ‚Äúproblem‚Äù points, which in theory do not raise unnecessary questions, but in practice are difficult to achieve. <br><br>  It is worth noting here that, following long discussions and approvals, it was decided to purchase a ready-made portal solution.  It was a kind of designer with an intuitive interface, it allowed to manage the internal portal without special knowledge of programming and layout skills.  In addition, it consisted of elements known to all Internet users - search, blogs, tags, social services, etc.  As it turned out, these ‚Äúsocial‚Äù principles are easily transferred to the corporate environment and help to work with information - to collect, structure, publish, edit, search, etc. <br><br>  One would like to write, work has begun to boil - the instrument has been selected, the budget has been allocated - and this is where our enthusiasm was interrupted by the question of general: ‚ÄúAre you sure that we need it?  Prove? ‚Äù- and this is in the company, where at that time there were more than five hundred employees only in the main office, not counting the regional branches! <br><br>  <b>Economic justification</b> <br><br>  It is considered that personnel officers do nothing but spend money on the company.  But not in this case, believe me.  Therefore, having decided on the choice, my colleague began to prepare ‚Äúreinforced concrete‚Äù substantiation of his ‚Äúventure‚Äù: <br><br>  1. Saving of working time: <br>  ‚Ä¢ since all the information necessary for the work will be accumulated on one resource, the costs of finding the necessary data at a particular time will be reduced.  Over time, this will accelerate the company's business processes; <br>  ‚Ä¢ the risk of leakage of corporate information will be reduced due to the communication of employees on the intranet, and the number of conflict situations between employees will be significantly reduced; <br>  ‚Ä¢ Adaptation of newcomers will take place in an accelerated mode - the need to search for the necessary HR will disappear, all documentation (list of documents for registration, employment contract, provision for leave, bonuses, etc.) will be available on the internal resource. <br>  2. Optimization of business processes: <br>  ‚Ä¢ The corporate portal allows employees to simultaneously work on documents, so that the company will significantly save on the speed of approval processes; <br>  ‚Ä¢ horizontal communication between departments will be much more efficient and will unite the team; <br>  ‚Ä¢ the need for business trips will disappear with a geographically distributed company structure. <br>  3. Improving the quality of management decisions: <br>  ‚Ä¢ The results of the work of staff and departments will gain transparency through joint discussion in working groups; <br>  ‚Ä¢ solutions of typical business problems can be found by employees in the corporate library. <br>  4. Improving employee performance: <br>  ‚Ä¢ Experience will be accumulated and stored in the corporate library, and will also be reused and more efficiently within the company.  As a result, the staff will be constantly trained and trained. <br>  5. Ensuring control and manageability: <br>  ‚Ä¢ internal correspondence of employees will be monitored, thus avoiding noisy discussions in the smoking room. <br>  ‚Ä¢ employment and lack of staff will be monitored; <br>  ‚Ä¢ Feedback from the staff will be faster and more efficient. <br>  6. Business efficiency: <br>  ‚Ä¢ the quality of work performed and customer service of the company will increase and the competitiveness of the company in the market will increase; <br>  ‚Ä¢ The company's image will rise in the eyes of employees, customers, partners and investors (all leading companies have their own corporate portal). <br><br>  A structured presentation, convincing argumentation and the necessary figures in the ‚ÄúSavings / Benefits‚Äù section became sufficient for the approval of the budget estimates and the launch of the project, which brought tangible dividends as a result. <br><br>  <b>"Money saved is money earned"</b> <br><br>  The corporate portal is a solution to save resources and increase employee productivity.  Any organization that follows the right path of development measures savings in monetary terms.  In respect of employees, their working time is money.  If they spend less time searching for information for work and other routine daily operations, therefore, they spend more time on the work itself. <br><br>  Due to the use of the portal's capabilities, each employee saves at least 5 minutes a day ... And now count and compare how much it will cost to implement the portal, taking into account saving 5 minutes of working time for all employees per year!  And if you think a little more, you can calculate the profitability from the implementation of this solution!  Agree, a weighty argument in his favor! </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/156459/">https://habr.com/ru/post/156459/</a></p>
