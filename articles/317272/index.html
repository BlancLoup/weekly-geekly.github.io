  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Security Week 49: Google fuzz open source, Android Trojan steals user accounts, Microsoft fixes old bug</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/24d/53a/75f/24d53a75faf04d239ae0425de42f5ff3.jpg" align="right">  On December 1, a team of security experts Google announced a new program, OSS-Fuzz, in which it plans to allocate resources for continuous fuzzing open source software ( <a href="https://threatpost.com/google-debuts-continuous-fuzzer-for-open-source-software/122250/">news</a> , <a href="https://security.googleblog.com/2016/12/announcing-oss-fuzz-continuous-fuzzing.html%3Fm%3D1">post</a> on the Google Security blog).  Fuzzing is an automated program testing method, the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãwhich was formulated back in the late 80s ( <a href="http://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~bart/fuzz/CS736-Projects-f1988.pdf">PDF</a> ).  With the increase in computer performance, a fairly straightforward process of feeding arbitrary data to software in the search for vulnerabilities is becoming more and more important.  And indeed, in a world where computers are increasingly being run by other computers, this is a good topic, already included, for example, in Microsoft's <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/sdl/">Secure Development Lifecycle</a> methodology. <br><br>  Explaining the success of the approach with respect to free software, Google gives <a href="https://bugs.chromium.org/p/oss-fuzz/issues/detail%3Fid%3D53">an example of a</a> vulnerability in the Freetype library, discovered by OSS-Fuzz fuzzer.  Freetype is installed on billions of devices, and therefore it is important to explore such software.  Serious open source vulnerabilities such as Heartbleed have shown that the very possibility of independent auditing does not equal increased security.  People just do not have enough hands to analyze everything, so robots come on the scene.  It's strange that Google doesn't say anything about Android fuzzing, although researchers from other companies <a href="https://www.blackhat.com/docs/eu-15/materials/eu-15-Blanda-Fuzzing-Android-A-Recipe-For-Uncovering-Vulnerabilities-Inside-System-Components-In-Android-wp.pdf">do it</a> . <br><br>  In fact, the main benefit of the project is that Google invites third-party researchers and open source software maintainers, in essence, providing them with computing resources within the project.  In his <a href="https://alexgaynor.net/2016/dec/03/oss-fuzz-initial-impressions/">impressions,</a> researcher and developer Alex Gaynor writes that in less than a day his test code added to OSS-Fuzz processed 17 trillion test cases, which would have taken him a month at home. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/245/8ed/9eb/2458ed9ebef84aafa9fdaea678e8157f.jpg"></div><br>  <i>Visual demonstration of fuzzing technology</i>

      <b>Android Trojan attacked more than a million users, possibly with a burglary Google account</b> <br>  <a href="https://threatpost.com/gooligan-malware-breaches-1-million-google-accounts/122195/">News</a>  <a href="http://blog.checkpoint.com/2016/11/30/1-million-google-accounts-breached-gooligan/">Research</a> Check Point Software.  Google <a href="https://plus.google.com/%2BAdrianLudwig/posts/GXzJ8vaAFsi">response</a> . <br><br>  The very news in which the estimates of the consequences of the work of a malicious program differ between the researcher and the vendor.  Everyone agrees that the Gooligan campaign has been around for a couple of years, its traces were found even in malicious attacks on Windows systems.  The spread of the Android Trojan occurs through unofficial app stores.  In Check Point, found more than 80 applications for smartphones with built-in malicious code, with their help allegedly managed to infect more than a million devices.  After the Trojan is activated, additional software is downloaded from the command server to obtain root privileges: Android 4 and 5 smartphones are subject to privilege escalation, by the way, almost <a href="https://developer.android.com/about/dashboards/index.html">three-quarters of</a> active devices still work on these versions. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/b82/0ce/ee6/b820ceee61d14ad38ac6738417e5ced0.jpg"></div><br><br>  All gestures are made to ‚Äúhijack‚Äù a Google account, but then the readings start to differ.  Check Point claims that the theft of an authorization token allows attackers to gain access to all user resources ‚Äî mail, disk, and so on.  Adrian Ludwig, chief Google security officer for Android, says that in fact personal data is not stolen.  Profit is achieved by creative interception of access to the official Google Play store.  Infected phones without demand begin to download applications, which affects their rating.  Apparently, the shop will soon be covered.  And not because Google will convince everyone not to install applications from unverified sources anymore.  And because it bans applications that are actively using a malicious campaign for promotion, in the official Google Play. <br><br>  <b>Microsoft without fanfare closed a two-year-old bug in the Windows kernel</b> <br>  <a href="https://threatpost.com/microsoft-silently-fixes-kernel-bug-that-led-to-chrome-sandbox-bypass/122179/">News</a>  <a href="https://bugs.chromium.org/p/project-zero/issues/detail%3Fid%3D206">Description of the</a> vulnerability in the Google Project Zero bug tracker. <br><br>  And this is news about third-tier vulnerabilities - which do not carry an immediate threat, or are exploited under some rare combination of circumstances.  However, here, too, it all depends on the evaluation of the parties involved.  Two years ago, an expert with the Google Project Zero reported to Microsoft the details of the Windows kernel vulnerability related to the operation of the SeFastTraverseCheck method, which is responsible for checking whether an object has permission to access a particular type of access to files or directories.  In some cases, the vulnerability allowed to get (fairly limited) access to the hardware, and in situations where this should not happen at all, for example, when executing code in the sandbox of Google Chrome. <br><br><div class="oembed"><twitter-widget class="twitter-tweet twitter-tweet-rendered" id="twitter-widget-0" style="position: static; visibility: visible; display: block; transform: rotate(0deg); width: 500px; margin: 10px auto; max-width: 100%; min-width: 220px;" data-tweet-id="803919573409992708"></twitter-widget><script async="" src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div><br><br>  In general, the situation is like in a joke: ‚ÄúDoctor, when I press this way here, it hurts here.  - And you do not press.  The researcher honestly said that this feature can be considered not a bug, but features, and simply taken into account when developing.  Microsoft two years ago rather quickly replied that it did not consider this a serious enough problem to qualify as a vulnerability.  At that time, the problem was confirmed by a researcher for Windows 7 and 8. And at the end of November, the same researcher suddenly discovered that the problem was solved, though already in Windows 10. <br><br>  That's how we live. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/1a3/d84/77c/1a3d8477c94641beaa19694292d10b54.png" align="right"><h3>  Antiquities </h3><br>  "Ufa-1201" <br><br>  Nonresident very dangerous virus.
