Got a decent bunch :) <br><br>  I divided them into two categories: in the case and "freak himself."  I want to start with "self-freaks" and other non-constructivism. <br><br><h4>  Arrivals: The design is very similar to Lebedev ... </h4><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Rebound: What is it like?  That in the center on the main the big picture is used?  Or the fact that the unvisited links are blue, and the visited ones are purple?  Or the fact that the structure of the pages is designed correctly?  And the fact that the information is easy to read from the screen?  What exactly?

      Bespontovy hike, hike.  If it looks like, in fact, that is fine.  "There" professionals work, very competent and correct guys.  And if they set the "height", then we must strive for it.  I think so. <br><br><h4>  Spit: The author‚Äôs desire to grab a piece on car enthusiasts is too great. </h4><br>  Jump to the side: Yes, the author has a desire to earn his piece of bread.  I would be cynical - on a piece of bread, on top of butter, I want to spread caviar without sparing.  This is bad?  I didn‚Äôt steal anything anywhere.  I honestly stick and I want my work and the work of people involved in the project to be worthy - I emphasize, worthily - paid.  And if, at the same time, I can also help someone - in general, lepotism. <br><br><h4>  Submission: While you have already made more than one site, then you can obviously have money for it ... or this is a goof or hell knows what ... </h4><br>  Return of the ball: This is to the fact that I asked for the free help of the flasher, despite the fact that I have a whole studio at my side? <br><br>  I will say this: it is important not to confuse ‚Äúsoft‚Äù with ‚Äúfluffy‚Äù.  Commercial studio work is one thing, this is work, business, if you like.  ‚ÄúThe right driver‚Äù is my personal, yet non-commercial project.  And to do it for the money of the studio, for the money of the partners is stupidly wrong.  The project will start on its feet, it will start making money - great, I will start ordering situations in the studio and so on.  In the meantime, there is not the slightest desire of partners to put on ‚Äúbablos‚Äù. <br><br>  I have another petty remark.  People wrote that they don‚Äôt want to work for the link.  No problem, no offense.  But, if you are a beginner flasher, designer, etc., then having links to your portfolio in a normal visited project is not so bad.  But this is my personal opinion, I do not impose it on anyone. <br><br><h4>  Ba-bang: For me, the project is a dummy.  But once again I repeat to children and people with the sign 70 probably it may seem interesting. </h4><br>  Oppanki: I constantly say in private conversations: the site is designed for people who are able to think, analyze and learn, if possible, from the mistakes of others.  To be honest, I myself, constantly reading articles from the site, changed my attitude towards the road.  He began to give way to the restructuring, he ceased to obscure the right and left of all in a row.  So the site is useful not only for "teapots", but also for me, with my experience of 8 years. <br><br>  And the fact that there are people who sneeze on everything is their problem, this is not my ‚Äúgoal‚Äù.  Their life and without me teach. <br><br><h4>  Fie again: How annoying are your ‚ÄúI am a goon‚Äù, ‚ÄúI am a fool‚Äù, ‚ÄúI am a freak‚Äù on the main page.  With the expression you need to be able to play. </h4><br>  Ugh in response: If you were cut off by a bastard on the road or a brainless sheep fell asleep at a traffic light, what do you say?  Yy, what offender is bad?  Not.  You say: "Here is a ram (ass, asshole, * blanc, freak)" and signal that there is urine or the distant cut in, is it true?  The site is made about people and for people.  For the lively and emotional :) <br><br>  The next post will consist of normal answers to constructive questions.  Thank you for reading to the end :) </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/58075/">https://habr.com/ru/post/58075/</a></p>
