      We are always frank with you, and now a few words in defense - this means "in defense of our product."  We <a href="http://medgadgets.ru/shop/intrarich.html%3Futm_source%3Dgeek%26utm_medium%3Dteip%26utm_campaign%3Dteip">sell kinesio tapes</a> . <br><br>  This product has become massive, and in the course of a year there has been a lot of landings, and sometimes descriptive articles on some sites are so <a href="http://fysiotape.su/kinesio-tape-benefits/">similar</a> to Jeans that you stop believing in the miraculous power of kinesio-teips yourself. <br><br>  Taking into account the fact that tapes of different quality <a href="https://www.google.ru/webhp%3Fsourceid%3Dchrome-instant%26ion%3D1%26espv%3D2%26ie%3DUTF-8">reached</a> stores such as Sportmaster and even Wildberry, this has ceased to be directly related to sports, and it seems like nothing at all: don‚Äôt understand what. <br><br>  <b>What it is</b> <br><br>  Physio-teip or kinesio-teip means ultra-elastic tape-patch for the prevention of sprains, bruises, manual dysfunctions, which is recognized as an effective therapeutic method for treating diseases of the musculoskeletal system and a number of others. <br><br>  <b>The use of physio-tapes</b> <br><br>  First of all, when it comes to taping, they cite the example of athletes.  However, the use of physio-tapes is much wider.  Including they are recommended to use for pregnant women to eliminate swelling of the legs or <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4837927/">relieve back pain</a> . <br><br>  <b>In sports</b> <br><br>  Of course, this is the central scope of kinesio-tapes.  The main advantages for athletes are that with reliable insurance against sprains, tapes do not restrain movement, as they are extremely flexible: they can stretch up to 60%. <br><br>  According <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5291586/">to the doctors</a> , taping methods are effective for relieving pain, due to the fact that patches affect the skin receptors: this is how we ourselves would lose our bruise. <br><br>  The studies show the results of randomized tests, indirectly confirming that kinesio tapes have a positive effect on the biomechanics of movements, including some <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4415822/">examples</a> where tapes contribute to an increase in the angle of the knee, but with appropriate equipment. <br><br>  Sports where tapes are seen: tennis, cycling, jogging, football and even!  <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3820175/">horse racing</a> <br><br>  <b>In medicine</b> <br><br>  Currently actively used in the treatment of articular diseases, diseases of the spine, <a href="http://www.ottobock.ru/media/local-media/for-specialists/orthotics/646a274-patella_pro.pdf">patellofemoral pain syndrome</a> , and <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4968501/">quite thoroughly</a> . <br><br>  Also, in some works, you can find indications that tapes are able to ‚Äúpump out‚Äù the elasticity of muscles, <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4175239/">adding flexibility</a> .  Moreover, the effect of this "doping" disappears after some time after removing the patch. <br><br>  The only thing about which, of course, they forget to write on the websites of the stores is that kinesio tapes are not an independent treatment method, but only a part of general therapy.  Yes, in most cases they have a positive effect, but together with other therapeutic and conservative methods. <br><br>  The latter is also important: do not impose a tape on the seam from the operation!  In other words, there are also contraindications to kinesio taping. <br><br>  <b>How much is it all learned</b> <br><br>  Kinesio tape has been known for almost 50 years, and its creation is the merit of <a href="http://medicine-and-sports.com/dr-kenzo-kase/">Kenzo Kase</a> . <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/7ed/4cb/a36/7ed4cba363fb45e089645a2a07803bdb.jpg"><br><br>  Strictly speaking, if you say ‚Äúkinesio-teip‚Äù, then it is necessary to imply a strictly specific brand, so that physio-teip is often found, which is essentially the same thing.  The word has become a household name, like "Xerox" and "Pampers."  Success! <br><br>  Without exaggeration, all this time, since the 70s of the last century, one way or another the mechanism of the effect of these tapes on the body is being studied, and now you can immediately find hundreds of articles devoted to this topic. <br><br>  <b>Are there any bad articles?</b> <br><br>  Yes, there are critics of this method.  One of the materials rather strictly proves that the kinesio tape is a <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4668342/">placebo</a> , and there was no difference in the two control groups of participants according to the results of the experiment. <br><br>  Also, the physicians <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4629941/">did not find</a> any substantially distinguishable effect when using kinesio-tapes in order to increase the elongation of the joints. <br><br>  The relevance of kinesio tapes in football <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4481836/">is</a> questioned. <br><br>  In the bulk, doctors recognize the taping method as positive.  In a number of publications, it is noted that the use of tapes helps to improve communication with mechanoreceptors, aligns fascial tissues, relieves pain from bruises, participates in the <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3812836/">treatment</a> of ankle injuries, etc. <br><br>  <b>How to use</b> <br><br>  The kinesio tape is stuck for up to 5 days, it has a water-repellent coating, and you can take a shower with it.  Then the old part is removed and, if required, a new tape is superimposed. <br><br>  <b>In the dry residue</b> <br><br><ul><li>  Despite hundreds of articles and a long history, the method is still recognized as controversial.  However, it is significantly saved by a negligible number of contraindications! </li><li>  It is proved that in some cases tapes are relevant in sports as the prevention of muscle injuries and pain relief tool. </li><li>  The teip properties associated with improving the biomechanics of movements, increasing the elasticity and flexibility of the body are not proven - they do not pull on doping. </li><li>  Athletes around the world have used and continue to use them. </li></ul></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/373311/">https://habr.com/ru/post/373311/</a></p>
