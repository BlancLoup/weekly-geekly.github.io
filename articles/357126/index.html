  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Roskomnadzor: control the data of Russian Internet users need to instruct the "national operator"</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/ae5/a79/39a/ae5a7939ad25358a97b11132c8599339.jpg" width="750"><br><br>  The head of Roskomnadzor, Alexander Zharov, announced the possibility of creating a ‚Äúnational operator of big data‚Äù in Russia.  According to the head of the agency, such an operator should be responsible for the ‚Äúturnover‚Äù of data from users of the Russian-speaking segment of the Internet, RBC <a href="http://www.rbc.ru/technology_and_media/17/06/2016/5763dbdf9a79478149ac7ff2">writes</a> .  The same operator, according to Zharov, will be directly responsible for the use of personal data that users place at the disposal of private companies and services. <br><br>  Zharov also said that a national operator could be created under the new law on big data regulation in Russia.  Appear this law can "in the medium term."  In order to establish the rules according to which the data of Russian users of the network are processed and stored, cooperation of representatives of business, society and the state is necessary. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  The head of Roskomnadzor believes that the scope of big data should be regulated.  The reason - now any data that is not directly relevant to personal data can be used to identify the user.  According to him, ‚Äúone global social network‚Äù analyzed the data of all its users.  Before the analysis, the data were depersonalized.  But with the help of "smart" algorithms, users, whose data were analyzed, were able to identify.  Therefore, according to Zharov, even indirect data can easily become personal.

      With Zharov, the presidential aide Igor Schegolev agrees.  He believes that companies need to work out special algorithms to assess the methods of collecting, processing and transmitting user data.  In addition, it is necessary to tell the user exactly what data this user gives and why.  ‚ÄúIn each application, you should probably write in large letters:‚Äú Carefully, you give those and those your data, they will be used this way, but you can prevent it, ‚Äùsays Schegolev. <br><br>  She argues that the regulation of big data is not only a matter of economics, there is also a moral and ethical component.  So, at the moment, the average user gradually disappears the ability to protect themselves and their data from prying eyes.  Shcheglov says that in the near future "your refrigerator will be spying on you". <br><br>  Ilya Massuh, President of the Information Democracy Foundation, confirmed the government‚Äôs intention to develop a domestic portal for controlling the dissemination of personal data.  Such a portal with a single database of personal data of users from Russia, he said, could work as the main tool for identifying a person‚Äôs identity.  Now, says Massuh, the personal data of the visitor can be received by the janitors, guards, employees of clinics in the registries.  As a result, these <a href="http://izvestia.ru/news/614837">data appear</a> in the databases of collectors, insurers and other "incomprehensible personalities."  In fact, there is a direct trade in personal data.  After the creation of a single portal, the same watchmen and guards will be obliged to enter the visitors' data into the database of this site, and not to record the passport data of citizens on paper. <br><br>  Let me remind you that on September 1, 2015, the Law on Personal Data entered into force in Russia.  It is he who regulates the storage and processing of personal information.  This law obliges Russian and Western companies to store personal data of users of the Runet in Russia.  There is an interesting moment in the law, according to which foreign embassies and air carriers located in Russia, as well as reservation systems and the media, are exempt from the need to store personal data of their own users.  This year, the agency has already checked about 600 companies for compliance with the conditions voiced earlier by Roskomnadzor.  By the end of the year, 900 more companies are planned to be tested.  Among other things, it is planned to check the Russian social network Vkontakte. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/357126/">https://habr.com/ru/post/357126/</a></p>
