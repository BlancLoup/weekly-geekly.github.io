In version 6, the long-awaited support for working with several projects was added, to speed up the work, the Ruby parser was rewritten, which at the same time added support for Ruby 2.1-preview1.  IDE has become much more productive, and we plan to support Ruby 2.1-preview2 in RubyMine 6.0.1. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a>

    <h4>  Important Improvements in RubyMine 6 </h4><br><ul><li>  built-in SSH-console and local command line, run from IDE; </li><li>  general improvements in code analysis; </li><li>  integration with Zeus; </li><li>  Improvements in the Ruby-code graphical debugger and debugger gem support with the ability to debug multiple processes in parallel; </li><li>  customizable delay auto run tests. </li></ul><br><br>  RubyMine 6 also includes many enhancements and new features of the IntelliJ platform, common to all our IDEs.  Of these, I want to highlight: <br><ul><li>  GitHub pull requests directly from the IDE, </li><li>  Improvements in working with SQL databases </li><li>  Subversion 1.8 support. </li></ul><br><br>  If you have not used our database support plugin in RubyMine before, then you are welcome to read our <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/JetBrains/blog/204064/">post yesterday</a> about working with it. <br><br><h4>  Details about some of the features of the new RubyMine </h4><br><h5>  Opening multiple projects in one window </h5><br>  The <a href="http://confluence.jetbrains.com/display/RUBYDEV/Working%2Bwith%2BMultiple%2BProjects">instructions</a> for working with multiple projects in one window tells how it works.  Among other things, it is convenient to navigate through the files of all projects at the same time, which facilitates both banal copy-paste and orientation in the code of related projects.  Now you can simultaneously work on the Rails application and the source code of the gems used in it in one IDE window. <br><br><h5>  Especially for speakers and screenmasters </h5><br>  Now in RubyMine there is a presentation mode and full-screen mode.  Called via <b>View |</b>  <b>Enter Presentation Mode</b> and <b>View |</b>  <b>Enter Full Screen</b> respectively.  In the presentation mode, only the editor window with the code is shown, and an enlarged font is used to make it easier to show the code on the big screen.  Switching back from both modes is very simple: mouse up until it stops, menu pops up, choose <b>View |</b>  <b>Exit Presentation Mode</b> or <b>View |</b>  <b>Exit Full Screen</b> . <br><br>  If you still have unassigned hotkeys, you can assign them the choice of presentation mode in <b>File |</b>  <b>Settings |</b>  <b>Keymap</b> <br><br>  By the way, about hot keys: thanks to Nikolai Chashnikov for the entire IntelliJ platform (and for the new RubyMine, therefore, too) the <b>Presentation Assistant</b> plugin appeared, which shows the shortcut keys that you press in large print at the bottom of the screen.  This is simply an indispensable thing for anyone who makes reports or screencasts.  Put it soon right from the JetBrains repository! <br><br><h5>  Improved Extract Method </h5><br>  Now, when calling the Extract Method, an automatic search for all duplicates in the code is done, which should be replaced with a method call.  When replacing the IDE shows duplicates found, allowing you to replace both all at once, and only some of them. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/aac/b5f/b9b/aacb5fb9b346f996d72a25352d06d7fb.png" alt="image"><br><br><h5>  Integration with Zeus </h5><br>  Zeus preloads your Rails application to speed up its launch.  The Zeus author in the <a href="http://vimeo.com/55184148">screencast</a> shows how he achieves acceleration 10 times.  What is the integration? <br><br>  First, you can start the Zeus server directly from the IDE.  Secondly, if it is running, then all Rails applications from the IDE can be run with it.  Thirdly, it is possible to debug applications with it.  <a href="http://confluence.jetbrains.com/display/RUBYDEV/Faster%2BRails%2BDevelopment%2Bwith%2BZeus">Read the instructions</a> for using Zeus from RubyMine. <br><br><h5>  Debugger </h5><br>  Our optimizers tried their best, and their efforts were not in vain: the JRuby debugger was 30% faster, and the Ruby 2.0 debugger was twice as fast!  In addition, RubyMine 6.0 has built-in support for the gem debugger. <br><br>  In addition, for all debuggers except Ruby 2.0, we added the ability to see the status of all threads of commands (threads) in a process that stopped at a breakpoint. <br><br><h5>  Tests </h5><br>  In the new version there are custom delays for automatic launch of tests - up to 10 seconds.  In addition, RubyMine is now better integrated with the RSpec test framework: it began to understand the dynamic matchers be_ * and have_ * and support auto-completion when using let, let!  and subject.  We also updated the relevant inspections, so nothing superfluous when using RSpec is no longer underlined in red. <br><br>  For more information about the release, read <a href="http://www.jetbrains.com/ruby/whatsnew/index.html">What's new</a> on our website. <br><br><h4>  What's next? </h4><br>  <a href="http://www.jetbrains.com/ruby/download/index.html">Download a</a> free 30-day trial version of RubyMine 6. <br><br>  Upgrading to version 6 is free for anyone who has acquired a license after November 26, 2012. <br><br>  Comments and suggestions on the new version will be very welcome in our <a href="http://youtrack.jetbrains.com/issues/RUBY">bug tracker</a> or in the comments to this post. <br><br>  And subscribe to <a href="https://twitter.com/rubymine">RubyMine Twitter</a> to always be aware of our news (and so there was where to write, if there is no time to write more than 140 characters)! </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/204198/">https://habr.com/ru/post/204198/</a></p>
