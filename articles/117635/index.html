However, the popularity of the console has recently waned.  And no wonder - before Wii was so popular thanks to its unusual manipulator, which, one can say, made a revolution in the world of gaming consoles.  But after a short time, similar manipulators were created for both the Xbox and PS3.  Now Wii had no advantages, since the device configuration is significantly losing to its competitors.  Guide Nintendo, apparently, has long suggested something similar, since recently it became known about the new version of the Nintendo Wii. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a>  The first rumors about the Wii 2 appeared in 2009, when the Nintendo Wii began to call the Wii HD.  I must say, these rumors were prophetic, apparently, some of them were based on some real facts.  Indeed, this console will produce a ‚Äúpicture‚Äù with a resolution of 1080p.  In addition, according to some reports, this console will not only not give in, but may even exceed Xbox 360 and PS3 in some parameters (although, it should be noted, in order to surpass the PS3, you have to try very hard).  Blu-ray drive can also be added.

      The same sources that tell about the Wii HD, say that it is quite likely that 3D will appear in the new console.  However, it was the lack of HD, and not the relatively weak configuration of this console, previously criticized by many gamers.  Now, in the case of the appearance of the Wii 2, this console may well become a new leader in the world of gaming consoles. <br><br>  New Wii, most likely, will be presented at the most famous event E3, which will be held June 7-9 in Los Angeles.  True, the release of the device to the market is planned in 2012, apparently, developers have a lot to do.  No wonder, because the Wii competitors are really very strong, so you have to try to become No. 1 competitor in the world of gaming consoles again. <br><br>  Naturally, since so far only rumors have been circulating about the Wii 2, although no one has yet said anything about the price of the console, although it is semi-official, so to speak.  Of course, if Nintendo wants to make their new brainchild a really dangerous competitor, then the price of such a device should be approximately equal to the price of other gaming consoles, Xbox and PS3. <br><br>  Via <a href="http://news.yahoo.com/s/nf/20110415/tc_nf/78172">yahpp</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/117635/">https://habr.com/ru/post/117635/</a></p>
