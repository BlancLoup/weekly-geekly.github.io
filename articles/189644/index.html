This is normal for small unclaimed projects.  It may seem sad, but such projects do not have the resources to sift ambiguous situations, you have to chop off the shoulder. <br><br>  Another thing is when projects that have a leading position in their field, projects that have a fairly long history for the Internet come in the same way.

      Should the user be photographed with a passport in his hands each time the project administration suspects inaccurate data?  Is it possible, based on user behavior on third-party projects, to accuse him of fraud?  Is it possible to analyze the behavior and information about the user on third-party projects? <br><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  It seems that all this is not very good.  But I could be wrong. <br><br>  Dry facts: <br><br>  Project weblancer.net.  I have been registered on it for more than 5 years, I am not a very active user of it, but there are several projects on which work has been done.  Somewhere half a year ago I could not remember the password, the recovery procedure did not produce results.  By contacting the support service, I learned that something had changed on the site and I had to provide my full name, date of birth, city, otherwise my account is not being processed normally.  Strange, but understandable.  You can certainly make a pop-up window, which will require this data, but apparently did not have time or scored, it happens. <br><br>  The next time I failed to enter after 3-4 attempts, I did not begin to wonder what was wrong, and turned to the support service, already feeling that I could not figure it out without them.  Password recovery works in 2 modes for email and for phone.  The catch is that if a phone number is specified, it is no longer possible to recover by email.  And in order to use the project normally, the phone must be indicated. <br><br>  I wrote a letter asking for help, the phone numbers I constantly use did not fit, exhausted all possibilities to enter the site without contacting support, can remind the last digits of the phone.  In response to the letter I received a sad reply, no one was going to help, advise, or at least send to help.  In the letter that I sent, mail.ru inserted the name from the settings, the name of the woman invented by chance, somehow did not notice.  Apparently, on this day, support decided to definitely ban someone, because based on the fact that there are other names in the letter than what is indicated on the site, my account was blocked.  Neither that I have access to a registered email, nor that I have access to a phone number tied to this account (I still tensed and remembered the phone number after a long correspondence, I hadn‚Äôt used it for a long time), and my explanations cannot convince the support that I am not a camel. <br><br>  In summary: After the first letter of the rhinestone bann.  I sent them reliable data, I wrote from the registered email, I remembered the phone number myself, nobody was saving me about it, I was immediately banned.  I turned to the support service only because before that there were problems with authorization which they themselves recognized. <br><br>  It would be clear if this would be done to save time, well, I‚Äôm tired of them, I‚Äôll appeal for the second time, give them feedback on authorization problems, it‚Äôs easier to ban and close the question.  But the support regularly responded to my explanations with new and new items from their user agreement, which at least somehow explained their unwillingness to meet the user. <br><br>  In order not to get into such a situation, I apparently should have been everywhere where I register on the Internet to write my exact full names.  Otherwise, you will send the letter with the wrong name, send the link to the wrong account and support you for suggesting that the name on mail.ru is correct, but after you agree to provide reliable data, you are lying.  The assumption is sad, unfounded. <br><br>  The loss is not great.  But the lost time to communicate with support, and 5 long years, during which I, although rarely, used their project led me to thoughts of responsibility.  Responsibility is borne by the administration of Internet projects, not only before saving personal data, providing paid services, but also to users who spend their time on this project. <br><br>  I do not mean now the case described above, he just pushed me to this reflection and is not the most vivid example of such behavior.  I understand that more unpleasant situations happen when certain organizations do not even fulfill their well-regulated obligations, paid services.  But this is the Criminal Code, if you can prove and get a crook. <br><br>  I want to pay attention to the moral part of the issue.  A priori user is an enemy and a potential fraudster?  Or the fact that he uses your project, spent time familiarizing himself with it, showed some activity on the site, told friends about it, told you about problems on the site, is it a reason for respecting him? <br><br>  After all, for whom we create projects, if not for other people?  Doesn't the heart tremble when the first users appear on the new project?  Do not want to ask them all whether they like everything in its place?  Should we appreciate the users who enrich our projects, create content, lead activity? <br><br>  I do not want to go to extremes.  People are different, users also understand when the user goes over the edge and starts a project to harm the task sometimes not easy.  Captchas, email activation, phone verification, all of this is aimed at separating the fraudster (the fraudulent bot) from the user. <br><br>  On my projects I try to always meet the user.  If the user abuses my attention, it is extremely rare, then I ask you to apply only in cases when without my participation in any way.  In cases with pavements, nothing is heard about them after the banna.  A dishonest user knows that he violated some rules and does not waste time to prove the opposite. <br><br>  Perhaps on larger projects you need to treat users differently.  But I don‚Äôt think it should be tougher. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/189644/">https://habr.com/ru/post/189644/</a></p>
