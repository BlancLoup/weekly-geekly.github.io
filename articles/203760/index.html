      Of course, every recruiter working in a particular specialization has the necessary knowledge to work in this specialization. <br>  I am familiar with technology and IT terms at the level at which I need it at work and I know how Java differs from JS (These are different programming languages, they have only 4 first letters in common in the title. <br>  Java is used in the development of desktop and server-side web applications. <br>  JS - in the client and server parts of web applications.  Very rarely JS is used in desktop applications). <br>  As for the computer hardware, I can hardly choose all the components in the store and assemble the computer.  But if one day I need computer assembly skills, for example, in search of a system administrator, then I think I will master them. <br>  I do not conduct a job interview.  I ask only clarifying questions about the reason for changing jobs, the wishes of the new team, the project.  I ask about salary expectations. <br>  Technical knowledge to a certain extent is necessary for IT recruiter, but the main role, I repeat, is played by communication skills. <br>  Establishing a fruitful relationship with the customer and the candidates - this is the main criterion for the skill of the recruiter. <br><br><blockquote>  Interested in failure statistics for job seekers not on professional skills: how often and common causes. </blockquote><br><br>  Cases of refusal to applicants are not in the level of professional skills, and in my practice, too.  The most common cause of failure is personal qualities and perceived incompatibility with the existing team.  No matter how cool this or that specialist is, if at the interview the manager sees that this job seeker is rude or most likely will not fit into the team, he will be most likely denied. <br>  I have never met an external data failure in IT.  This is too much.  This is true if it happens, it is very, very rare. <br><br><blockquote>  At what points in the resume does the recruiter pay attention to at least make an appointment for the candidate? </blockquote><br><br>  The question is really worth it, because whether you place a resume on work sites, such as Hh.ru or send it directly to the company you want to work in, anyone can read it first: secretary, office manager, recruiter, HR manager, technical director .  And the fact that this ‚Äúfirst‚Äù sees in him often determines whether the company will continue to communicate with you. <br>  In addition, we must not forget that in addition to the human factor there is also the relevance of the summary for search filters (on job sites). <br>  The first and basic rule of the summary is that it should be universal.  After reading it, both the secretary and the technical manager should understand your level of qualifications. <br>  A few tips on how to make a resume versatile and easy to search: <br>  - one resume - one position.  If you have a heterogeneous experience, build and present it so that your strengths get a general direction, important for the desired position; <br>  - do not be afraid to indicate contacts.  Write mail, phone, skype and link to the account in the professional network.  Give the work more opportunities to find you; <br>  - specify the move only when they are ready to move; <br>  - pay attention to the photo in the resume - it should be disposing and not too outrageous; <br>  - specify the desired level of income, but be prepared to move in small limits in both directions; <br>  - write in detail in the ‚ÄúExperience‚Äù section about projects in which you participated and about the technologies that you used in each of the projects; <br>  - write not only common words, but also specific abbreviations and terms, perhaps the recruiter will set up a search just for this keyword; <br>  - at the end of the summary write a little about which company and project you would like to work on.  This will help the recruiter to offer the most interesting job for you when searching for similar positions, but for different companies, in agencies this happens quite often. <br><br><blockquote>  Staff turnover among the candidates hired by you personally, if there is such statistics? </blockquote><br><br>  I personally have little experience to talk about some statistics, so I‚Äôll give the agency‚Äôs experience: only 3% of the applicants employed by us again change jobs in the first six months.  3% - no more no less.  Why is the figure so small?  We work only with good vacancies in large IT companies whose name is known to many, or we offer vacancies in cozy start-ups with a bright future.  People like to work on interesting projects in a good team, therefore there is almost no turnover. <br><br><blockquote>  What is the weight for a recruiter: education, employment record, vendor certificates, completed projects, articles (karma) on the same Habr√©, letters of recommendation or something else? </blockquote><br><br>  Probably it is more correct in this situation to talk about the importance of certain items not for the recruiter, but for the employer. <br>  Of course, the most important thing is implemented projects.  Because it is in practice, and not while studying at a university, a specialist receives the bulk of those skills and abilities that are of value to the employer.  Therefore, projects and technologies used in them need to be written and talked in sufficient detail. <br>  The presence of vendor certificates or employment records does not guarantee your professionalism (for example, there are dumps for passing Microsoft certificates), and you could get a lot of experience in an unofficial place of work.  But this is more of an exception.  Yes, recruiters look at the availability of certificates and job titles in a resume, but neither one nor the other does not overshadow projects. <br>  Publishing books and speaking at conferences is quite controversial.  In each case, you need to individually look at how serious the conference is and whether the content of the book is sensible. <br>  Do I need letters of recommendation?  I would say no, for IT it is not so relevant.  The maximum that occurs here is a call with a recommendation request from a previous place of work. <br><br><blockquote>  Why in the post-Soviet IT space mostly recruiters got accustomed, but hr is practically not.  They sent the offer, took the person and forgot about it, until he comes with a statement on dismissal.  Most of the companies do not have any developed permanent measures to retain, adapt, or develop a specialist. </blockquote><br><br>  Yes, indeed, HR is not a personnel officer in the Soviet sense of the word.  Why HR'ov can be found not in every company? <br>  The first and, probably, the main reason is the company's leadership misunderstanding how important HR functionality is.  The importance of a recruiter, by the way, is understood by everyone who has ever encountered the problem of finding a new employee.  After all, to find one suitable person and conduct a full circle of interviews with him, the recruiter needs about 30 hours - almost a working week.  Heads of companies and group leaders naturally don‚Äôt have that amount of time to recruit new team members, so the recruiter‚Äôs function is clear to them. <br>  The fact that a company needs an HR manager, the same leaders think only when the internal problems in the team are so serious that it is simply impossible not to notice them (up to mass layoffs).  Caught in such a deplorable situation, the leadership hastily looks for a person who fixes these problems and solves them.  Recognizing and trying to understand what this work is called and who to look for, they understand that we need HR. <br>  No less serious problem of the HR industry is the lack of high-quality specialized education.  HR is practically never taught anywhere, which is why people with different liberal arts education come to work, and sometimes even techies with developed communication skills. <br>  We must pay tribute, more and more IT companies understand the importance of adaptation and motivation of employees and give a sufficient amount of attention to this issue.  I am sure that this trend will continue and in a few years will gain momentum in the regions. <br><br><blockquote>  When will begin to make out normally the offer on work, but not to write about cookies.  Is it really so difficult to attach a 2-3 sheet document with a detailed description of a vacancy, a description of a company, a project, contact details, a map to the office for an interview and, most importantly, an approximate salary? </blockquote><br><br>  We, recruiters, are happy to send just such job descriptions if we had them.  But they are often not.  This begs the question: why? <br>  Often, the manager only at the interview understands which of the three projects is better to invite one or another specialist, where he will be more comfortable and what tasks are most interesting for him.  It is for this reason that in the description of the vacancy there is no particular specifics on the tasks and the project description is not detailed. <br>  Why are the conditions (cookies) described in such detail?  This information is added to the vacancy text by the recruiters themselves, knowing the strengths of the company's corporate culture.  No one wants to work on the outskirts of the city in an unrepaired office, without a VHI and get a gray salary, so the recruiter is in a hurry to inform the candidates that his company offers comfortable working conditions. <br>  Why is there no mention of salary in the vacancy text? <br>  For each position there is a minimum and maximum levels of remuneration for the specialist. <br>  We have already said that the labor market now is a candidate market.  They assess their experience and knowledge, and then communicate this price in a resume (or keep in mind in the form of certain salary expectations). <br>  The employer and the recruiter are able to roughly estimate the experience of a candidate, but the final word is still for those who are looking for work. <br>  I will give a simple analogy with the market: applicants are sellers, and recruiters are buyers.  The price is set by the seller.  Agree, you do not come to the market and do not say "I will buy you apples for 50 rubles"? <br><br><blockquote>  More than once the topic of the importance of activity on github, stackoverflow and similar resources was raised.  Is this important for recruiters or not?  And is it possible that in the future without a profile pumped up on the same GitHub, the recruiter will consider the resume last? </blockquote><br>  Of course, resumes without reference to GitHub were considered and will be considered.  However, a profile pumped on GitHub is important, because almost always bundled with a resume you need to show the customer (for example, the head of the development department) also examples of the candidate's code.  Not everyone can provide a piece of code from the current place of work: ‚ÄúI have a secret project‚Äù, ‚Äúclosed repositories‚Äù, ‚Äúthere is nothing like that‚Äù and so on.  The link to the pumped GitHub directly into the resume makes it much easier and faster to review your candidacy.  The key word here is "pumped".  It is necessary that your profile in all its glory reveals your technical level at the moment. <br>  Summing up, I would like to once again note that the main goal of the recruiter is to establish communication between the employer and the applicants at the proper level.  As a result, the search efficiency and the speed of closing a job is greatly increased. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/203760/">https://habr.com/ru/post/203760/</a></p>
