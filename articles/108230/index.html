      Over 2 years of existence, the company was able to create a quality product that can be conveniently used anywhere, anytime, and in any way.  Just the other day, HootSuite.com entered the TOP 500 sites rated by Alexa. <br><br>  Total application is used by about 1,000,000 users. <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  <b>A warning</b> <br>  The entire post - a set of subjective opinions of one person.  My impression of HootSuite is influenced by the fact that <b>I have been working with them</b> for 3 months already, and that I have <b>been using their product</b> for a year now. <br><br>  At the same time, it is obvious that my primary opinion was formed long before employment. <br><br>  This post should not be considered official.  My goal is to share a cool project with the community that is somehow underestimated here. <br><br>  So, 10 reasons to make friends with HootSuite. <br><br><h4>  1. The main client is in the browser </h4>  HootSuite is, first of all, a <b>web application</b> .  Built without the use of Flash and other weighting technologies, this client is accessible from any popular browser, and therefore <b>on any computer</b> : home, work, university, Internet cafe.  There are also additional benefits. <br><br>  Firstly, the <b>operating system is not important</b> .  Whether Windows, Mac OS or Linux, you will have access to all the features of the client. <br><br>  Secondly, there is no need to install anything and, consequently, to occupy extra disk space and memory cards. <br><br>  Thirdly, HootSuite can be easily combined with <b>browser plug-ins</b> , for example, with those that check spelling.  This removes a lot of inconvenience in many applications built, for example, based on Adobe Air.  My favorite <a href="http://punto.yandex.ru/">Punto Switcher</a> also works. <br><br>  Despite the fact that HootSuite is <a href="http://hootsuite.com/pro">shareware</a> (freemium), 94% of users will not even notice this - most of the functionality is available indefinitely. <br><br><h4>  2. Free mobile apps </h4><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/18ef0835/5baef27f/a2b65daa/705583e0.png"><br><br>  HootSuite is also available <b>on many mobile platforms</b> .  Do you have an iPhone?  Fine!  Do you have a phone with Android?  Cool!  Even if you have a Blackberry from somewhere, the application works on it.  All mobile programs are free, stable and convenient. <br><br>  By the way, which is good, the <b>migration</b> between versions is completely painless - knowing how to use the web version, you instantly learn from the mobile (in my case, iPhone).  In the near future, the company promised to release a <a href="http://hootsuite.com/ipad">version for the iPad</a> . <br><br><h4>  3. More than twi </h4><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/095c76c4/83fc6263/527819de/74aa669e.png"><br><br>  HootSuite is not just a twi client.  The application allows you to easily manage Facebook profiles and Facebook pages, LinkedIn, Foursquare, Wordpress, MySpace, Ping.fm, and Mixi (Japan) ... * breathless * <br><br>  In general, the entire API that these networks are willing to share, HootSuite uses. <br><br>  Moreover, we are working on the release of <b>our own API</b> , which will allow third-party developers to add other social networks themselves, as well as create other plug-ins.  Thus, in the future it will be possible to manage, for example, LJ or Tumblr. <br><br><h4>  4. OpenID authorization </h4>  There is nothing easier than to log into HootSuite via OpenID, add an account via oAuth and start working.  <b>No long registration forms.</b> <br><br><h4>  5. Anything </h4>  The application, as mentioned earlier, is designed for very active users.  Therefore, the tools here are appropriate. <br><br>  <b>Planning publications.</b>  In HootSuite, you can easily set the date of any publication in advance or save the post as a draft.  Personally, I use it often when I ripen on something clever in the middle of the night, but I don‚Äôt want to speak with emptiness :). <br><br>  <b>Multichannel.</b>  In HootSuite, you can create up to 10 columns with different data: mentions, retweets, lists, search queries.  And now we multiply 10 by 20, since there are tabs in HootSuite, and in each of them you can create different columns. <br><br>  The latter is very convenient for <b>tracking</b> topics, your brand, competitors and customers.  Among other things, each column can be filtered by keywords. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/bc5eb74a/a6cb20af/38d31421/2d479530.png"><br><br>  <b>Contact Management.</b>  All followers and followers can be viewed, evaluated and done something with them: for / otfollovit, scatter through the lists, etc.  HootSuite also provides Insights, which automatically gather additional information about people based on their tweets.  It works very well for Russian-speaking users (see screenshot). <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/912acb69/96812010/4c5e1e94/95a288c3.png"><br><br>  <b>RSS import.</b>  You can import and publish entries from the RSS machine.  Replaces <a href="http://twitterfeed.com/">Twtitterfeed</a> . <br><br><h4>  6. Analytics </h4><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/098918bc/71d74dff/5867512a/040da306.png"><br><br>  In HootSuite there is a whole bunch of analytic gadgets.  For example, you can connect <b>Google Analytics</b> from your site and watch graphs, comparing with the number of tweets and the popularity of your links. <br><br>  And, more recently, there is a cool-designed statistics of Facebook pages.  And detailed information on retweets using <a href="http://topsy.com/">Topsy</a> . <br><br>  If you are connected to the English-speaking market, you will also find convenient <a href="http://klout.com/">Klout-assessments</a> .  With the Russian guys are not friends, unfortunately. <br><br><h4>  7. Abbreviations </h4>  The system has its own <a href="http://ow.ly/">ow.ly</a> and <a href="http://ht.ly/">ht.ly</a> services through which you can shorten links and upload images.  Services also <b>count clicks</b> and show them in analytics, as mentioned earlier. <br><br><h4>  8. Corporate happiness </h4>  The pro-version of HootSuite opens up a whole new world of features and capabilities.  The application was originally designed for business use and there are probably no competitors for it. <br><br>  You can <b>create a team</b> , distribute <b>tasks to the</b> right and left in the style of "reply to this tweet", "comment on this message." <br><br>  There are also opportunities to <b>distribute rights</b> , share search columns and each social.  network separately. <br><br><h4>  9. In Russian </h4>  Now HootSuite is actively being <a href="http://translate.hootsuite.com/">translated by fans into various languages ‚Äã‚Äãof the world</a> .  When everything is translated, HootSuite will be one of the first products in its category available in Russian.  Even the web-based Twitter interface, as you know, does not allow this to itself. <br><br>  Those.  Support and news in Russian can be received via @ <a href="http://twitter.com/HootSuite_RU">HootSuite_RU</a> .  Yes, I am driving it now. <br><br><h4>  10. Owl </h4><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/8fe25a34/716332ec/703285d2/7a983cfd.png"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/fae53548/e65c8bda/5669e341/774f8915.png"><br><br>  Isn't that pretty?  :) <br><br>  Here, perhaps, that's all.  If you have questions, ideas or comments, I will be glad to discuss them in the comments. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/108230/">https://habr.com/ru/post/108230/</a></p>
