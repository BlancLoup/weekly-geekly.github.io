  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Service-oriented technology or a small introductory orientation in the world of SOA</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Hello, haberdasher and all good people. <br><br>  I have been sitting here for a long time, but so far I have only been reading.  It's time for me to bring something into this interesting resource. <br>  What interesting things can I tell you?  I am engaged in web development, css, javascript, php and others, but my main job is working at the Bank (Banking Systems Development Specialist). <br><br>  At the moment I am actively working with the Oracle product - <i>Oracle SOA Suite 11g, MiddleFusion Controll 11g, Enterprise Manager, Weblogic</i> .  On Habr√© I met quite a few articles about this, but partly on java-development.  And I want first of all to introduce readers to Oracle SOA Suite 11g, to talk about some of the features that can really be learned only by working with this technology.  And since now such an integration bus is only beginning to interest many financial institutions with its perspective, and in general, therefore, I think this topic is relevant, especially since I can share my experience. 
      <br>

      <br>
      Also, all the software that I use is licensed and paid - which means for you this is an opportunity to learn about the product and its benefits without buying it. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h5>  <b>So, what makes this product interesting?</b> </h5><br>  - today service-oriented technology (Service Oriented Apllication, SOA) allows you to expand the capabilities of the IT sphere.  Oracle SOA Suite 11g greatly simplifies the process of creating and deploying SOA, as well as managing it with best-in-class, integrated, open, integrated technology. <br>  From the official site - like a book: <br><br><blockquote>  ‚Ä¢ <i>Simple and high-performance development</i> ‚Äî a unified, easy-to-use set of tools that improves developer productivity, encourages asset reuse and encourages collaboration between the information system developer and business representatives. <br>  ‚Ä¢ <i>Highest performance and scalability</i> ‚Äî real-time event handling, high-bandwidth utilization, and the use of the industry's most scalable grid of application servers for high performance and reliability. <br>  ‚Ä¢ <i>Unified management and control</i> - a unified infrastructure for events and services, as well as end-to-end tracking of copies across all applications, provide integrated management and protection of the system. </blockquote><br><br>  This is all almost true. <br>  I believe that for a real user, 3 things are important - the speed of processing and executing Services and applications, flexibility in development and configuration, and of course protection, and all this can be found here.  And of course Oracle SOA Suite and the bus transforms a single IT infrastructure into a more flexible and manageable one.  The only problem is the lack of <s>Brains</s> specialists in this service-oriented technology in the CIS countries. <br><br>  From personal experience - the Indian caliper of Orakla did not distinguish itself in my memory for its effectiveness, but as always it was necessary to take on the Tambourine.  Just want to note that this is a very flexible system - this is both good and bad.  Well - you can integrate everything that integrates - I would, perhaps, in a couple of years, with this system I would automate my house into a single console under integration <br>  Oracle SOA.  Bad - this system is still quite new and not as common as, for example, photoshop, and even a support or helpers will hardly give you an answer to your questions. <br><br>  And for each web developer it is familiar - such a system works the fastest under Linux, although its administration and development works well under Windows. <br><br>  For greater credibility, this is how <b>Orakl supports my motivation</b> to work with this system: <br><blockquote>  ‚Ä¢ University of Adelaide optimizes performance with Oracle SOA Suite <br>  ‚Ä¢ The University of Virginia uses the Oracle SOA Suite to manage risk compliance. <br>  ‚Ä¢ Rosendin Electric automates Procure-to-Pay processes using Oracle SOA Suite <br>  ‚Ä¢ The integration of Oracle SOA Suite with Facebook allows GM OnStar to bring new services to the market faster <br>  ‚Ä¢ Using Oracle SOA Suite allows Telenet to bring new services to market faster <br>  ‚Ä¢ With Oracle SOA Suite and bus, Dell transforms its unified IT infrastructure into a more flexible and manageable <br>  ‚Ä¢ Using the Oracle SOA Suite enabled the Belgian federal government to reduce service development time from 12 to 2 months. </blockquote><br><br><h5>  <b>Oracle SOA Suite 11g Composition</b> </h5><br>  Oracle SOA Suite 11g includes: <br><ol><li>  Oracle Service Bus </li><li>  Oracle BPEL Process Manager </li><li>  Oracle B2B Integration </li><li>  Oracle Business Activity Monitoring </li><li>  Oracle Event Processing </li><li>  Oracle Business Rules </li><li>  Oracle JDeveloper </li><li>  Oracle Enterprise Manager </li></ol><br><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/168/789/5f8/1687895f84fa50338c8aeef53213a263.png" alt="Oracle SOA 11g"><br><br>  Here (in the corporate standard), of course, cheating with patches, cracks, and broken licenses no longer rolls, unfortunately. <br><br>  The Oracle SOA Suite is based on standards, with the ‚Äúhot-pluggable‚Äù infrastructure capability interacting with existing IT investments, reducing initial costs.  All of these components provide a sequence of tools and the actual functionality, a single implementation and management of the model, the provision of end-to-end security and a unified management of metadata - this is what these components will give you.  Managed automation orchestration service rules improve efficiency and flexibility.  A complete SOA platform provides the necessary unified and ‚Äúend-to-end‚Äù business model across all enterprises.  So in theory.  In practice, all components are used very rarely.  Firstly, it is expensive.  You should not even mention the caliper from Orakla and further support.  Secondly, in such a package many opportunities are realized for all sorts of tasks and few people need the full range of such large-scale and expensive software.  You will not install the full Adobe package if you need Photoshop. <br><br><h5>  I actively use: </h5><br>  - <i>JDeveloper</i> - in reality, it is an editor for creating various kinds of composites, applications and in general projects.  What does he give me?  - quick ability to simulate, program, debug, test, profile, configure and implement applications.  Also, I optionally set myself - the Composite Assebly Editor, in order to perform the assembly of various composites and technologies in virtual mode. <br>  - <i>Oracle Enterprise Manager</i> is in fact a very convenient and intuitive policy manager ‚Äî web access, service logging, content checking, caching, throttling ‚Äî a threshold of simultaneously incoming messages that, when reached, the bus stops calling the service provider and begins to add messages in queue.  This protects the service provider from Denial of Service attacks. <br>  - <i>Oracle BPEL Process Manager</i> - I use for convenient construction of BPEL processes. <br><br>  It is also worth noting that for all developers and integrators, without exception, a new stage in the development of management is now approaching - namely, Cloud Management, which is most welcome here and implemented. <br><br><h6>  Interested? </h6><br>  Who likes or who is interested in this technology and software, I will tell you many more interesting, important "pieces" in future reviews and specific experienced examples, because in due time, knowing the Zen of this software, I simply had no one to ask for advice. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/164909/">https://habr.com/ru/post/164909/</a></p>
