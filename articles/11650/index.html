Breakthrough in the spirit of time ‚Äùabout the history of the IT giant, Google search engine.  Read quickly and with interest. <br><br>  The book contains 26 chapters, telling about the development and formation of a company in chronological order: from the problem of finding information on the Web, the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãcreating a new search system to an IPO and future plans for the company's founders (Larry Page and Sergey Brin).  By the way, Bryn was born in the Soviet Union. <br>  Preface to the Russian edition was written by V. Dolgov, director of the Russian representative office of Google, in which he speaks more about the power of the giant than about the usefulness of the book.  Also, Mr. Dolgov writes that it will be possible to learn from the book the causes and features of such a large-scale development of the company.  Exaggerates a bit.  You can learn a lot, but not the main thing.  which allowed the search engine to seize the world, including China, where far from simply the situation with censorship and the Internet in general. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a>  The book is worth reading.  Even because it serves as a guide for a specialist in any field of business in an extraordinary business management that makes a profit and, most importantly, customers.

      Each chapter of the book is not only a stage in the development of Google, but also a new idea that can be applied in your company.  I really liked the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãa letter to ‚Äúfriends of Google,‚Äù which was sent out by the founders every time something significant happened.  True, on 368 pages I did not find the answer, who are these same friends.  An important thought passes through the whole book - Google was the first to do nothing, the company created only more sophisticated products that satisfied consumers the most (contradiction of Trout's theory) and thus made them loyal to the brand. <br><br>  The book has a lot of useful information for managers who can learn about building corporate culture and motivation systems.  Pleased with the rule of 20% from Google, which allows employees to pay 1 day per week to developing their own ideas.  Thanks to this, many projects have been created that are now actively used by Google visitors.  An example is Froogle.com (Yandex.Market has become an analog in Russia). <br>  In the book a lot of interesting things.  Total and not to list.  If you read, you will learn about the problems that arose at the initial stage with Larry and Sergey, about their studies at Stanford, about financial successes, IPO, struggle and opposition to Microsoft, Yahoo!  and other companies and the current state of affairs. <br><br>  Of course, not without a fly in the book.  I didn‚Äôt like the fact that Vise (the author of the book) in every paragraph speaks about the superiority of Google, its uniqueness, success and so on.  There are too many repetitions in the text.  And for me, Chapter 18 ‚ÄúCharlie‚Äù, which tells of the chef, became incomprehensible.  Why write on 15 pages about the kitchen. <br><br>  In my opinion, little attention is paid to the launch of Gmail.  The author focuses solely on litigations that were associated with the release of the postal service, but did not at all mention the unique marketing ploy, which allowed Gmail to become the most popular free postal service. <br><br>  If you decide to open a new project or company, but I recommend reading this book.  The success of others will set up in a positive way, as well as give strength to the creation of good. <br><br>  What are your impressions after reading the book?  Share. <br><br>  Source: <a href="http://www.preveryday.ru/">PReveryday.ru</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/11650/">https://habr.com/ru/post/11650/</a></p>
