  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Who do Ukrainian recruiters hunt on the Internet?</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  We are watching the emergence of the labor market in Ukraine.  In this case, the analysis was carried out using the portal Rabota.ua - as the largest portal for employment.  The choice is due to the fact that 85% of vacancies posted on the Internet go to this site.  Therefore, exploring the data of this site can determine the trends in the labor market of Ukraine: which specialists in our country have a shortage, and where there is a competition.  We can also see what level of salary is offered for different specialties.  Today we publish an analysis of the work of recruiting agencies.  Many large Ukrainian companies are currently looking for staff through agencies.  Therefore, we will try to look at the labor market and search for candidates through their eyes. <br><br>  In Kiev, the demand for closing some vacancies is five times higher than the supply of the labor market.  It is therefore not surprising that even many large companies can not cope with the independent selection of leading employees.  In such a situation, they are forced to use the services of recruiting agencies that earn money on finding qualified personnel to order.  You can find out who recruiters hunt for and what they are offered in return by analyzing online vacancies of recruitment agencies. <br><br>  On the largest Ukrainian portal on employment - Rabota.ua (www.rabota.ua) 18 recruitment agencies place an average of 266 vacancies.  Moreover, sales managers are in the greatest demand among recruiters - 55 vacancies.  Great attention to this profession is explained by the fact that in Ukraine a substantial part of business is concentrated in trade.  And since competition in the market is palpable, it is not surprising that the best companies want to get the best sellers.

      The second and third place in the demand of recruiting agencies are divided by vacancies of top managers and heads of departments - 47 proposals for each.  Despite the fact that at the moment on the portal Rabota.ua more than 1300 resumes with applicants for these positions are posted, recruiters continue to publish their vacancies, hoping to find the best specialists.  High requirements for applicants determine the offer of favorable working conditions and remuneration. <br><br>  After analyzing the statistics, it can be noted that specialists with technical education are also in demand.  This is confirmed by the fact that the fourth and fifth places in the ranking are occupied by engineers and equipment sales managers - 34 and 30 vacancies, respectively. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/olpictures/082/5e2/cf6/0825e2cf65390fd9871b6b2748181174.gif" width="450" height="233" alt="Job Rating" hspace="10" vspace="10"><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/olpictures/e94/83d/d17/e9483dd17838baec95f271ca2531eb10.gif" width="450" height="209" alt="Job Rating" hspace="10" vspace="10"><br>  Unexpectedly, large salaries were offered to HR specialists and business coaches - an average of 1,672 USD.  if necessary, to close only 13 vacancies.  In turn, the most demanded specialists - sales managers are offered only an average of 885 cu.  Although it is correct on the part of recruiting agencies to bid for a sales manager, after all, these specialists receive a percentage of sales.  Also interesting is the fact that the salary offer for marketing professionals is higher than for top managers - 1559 cu  against 1542. On average, the difference is small, but the situation itself is illogical, because the top manager makes the final decisions. <br><br>  The geography of personnel search remains unchanged.  The largest number of employees is necessary for Kiev - 54% of vacancies posted by recruitment agencies.  This is not surprising, since almost all the offices of large companies are located in the capital.  As for the regions, here, as one would expect, Odessa is in the lead - 18%, Donetsk - 11% and Kharkiv - 10%.  In other cities, this figure is less than 7% of vacancies. <br><br>  In addition, the portal Rabota.ua is used by foreign recruitment agencies, in order to recruit staff to work abroad.  For example, the Austrian agency ARTHUR HUNT and the Czech Grafton periodically search for staff for their clients on Rabota.ua. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/olpictures/c78/360/93c/c7836093cd4e43bf9291cd8b66958fc4.gif" width="450" height="203" alt="Proposed salary for job seekers" hspace="10" vspace="10"><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/olpictures/d69/a0e/7ec/d69a0e7ec2163ff34123e76177c14d37.gif" width="450" height="209" alt="Proposed salary for job seekers" hspace="10" vspace="10"><br>  Judging by the constant updating of the list of vacancies of recruitment agencies, the demand for recruitment services on the Internet is stable.  This means that applicants will be able to choose lucrative job offers without leaving their computer, and employers will receive qualified personnel.  Let's hope that all parties will be pleased with such cooperation! <br><br>  Information for reference: <br><br>  RABOTA.ua (www.rabota.ua) is the largest domestic employment portal and the leader of Internet recruiting in Ukraine.  More than 800 resumes and about 4,000 vacancies are added to RABOTA.ua daily.  Every day the portal is visited by about 30,000 people from all regions of Ukraine.  More than 50,000 people have signed up for the posting of vacancies posted on RABOTA.ua. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/3107/">https://habr.com/ru/post/3107/</a></p>
