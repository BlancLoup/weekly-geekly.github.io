Based on the data provided, such users turned out to be more than 90%, about 9% still continue to use 6 iOS, and about 1% remained on earlier versions of iOS. <br>  iOS 7 bypasses the pace of adaptation of iOS 6, as well as Android KitKat, from its main competitor.  As a result, the release of iOS 8 is also expected to be very successful and quick to learn by users.  The iOS 8 interface will be based on iOS 7, but many useful features will appear, including: interactive notifications, support for third-party keyboards, integration between iOS and OS X. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br><h4>  The European Commission again looks at Apple's in-ups </h4><br>  The European Commission said that Apple does not solve the problems associated with in-app purchases on its platform, although in February clearly outlined recommendations for how to work with similar applications were made.  The statement also says that no specific and explicit decisions have been made by Apple, especially related to payment authorization issues.  And in general, they did not make any firm statements and promises to correct, and they didn‚Äôt even designate when they would be corrected, hell be like that!  To which the company objects that it, of course, deals with the issues identified, and somewhere deeply concerned about the topic raised ... it simply cannot precisely define the time when everything will become ‚Äúas it should.‚Äù  ‚ÄúFor this year, we made it so that applications with in-app purchases are clearly marked, and we will continue to work on these issues with members of the European Commission.‚Äù  And in general, soon (in the next version of iOS?), The company will roll out the associated family accounts, with the activated function ‚Äúmaaa, well, cuopiii!‚Äù, What more?

      Google, meanwhile, made these hardest statements and set the time frame - promising to stop advertising applications with the word "free" by September, if in-app purchases are used in the application.  And besides, before each purchase will add a verification procedure.  Wanted?  Hold on!  It is unclear whether the changes will be applied to google.play worldwide, or will affect only Europe. <br><br><br><h4>  Mobile games account for 84.9% of all revenue in the stores. </h4><br>  Midia Research prepared a report in which it calculated the amount of revenue of applications depending on categories for Google Play and the Apple App Store <br>  This statistic does not show any surprises, the vast majority of revenues came from gaming applications - 81.4%.  Then follow social networks with 4.1%, data with 3.9% and closes the top four, travel applications - 2.3%. <br><br>  It is safe to conclude that gaming applications are the driver of revenue growth from mobile platforms, and apparently there are no changes foreseen, the main problem lies in the fact that the monetization mechanisms of games are understandable to the majority, while they have not learned how to monetize applications.  The popular trend - hemification, has not yet given its fruits and colleagues from Ubergizmo advise starting their marches on mobile platforms with gaming applications - though Ubergizmo forgot to mention how fierce competition exists now in the market and places have not been enough for a long time. <br><br><br><h4>  Additional ways to increase revenue from your game. </h4><br>  The competition is high.  A game without marketing with a probability of 95% will be immediately and forever buried in the depths of App Strore or Google Play.  The <a href="http://gamasutra.com/blogs/JayPowell/20140715/221128/Six_Ways_to_Squeeze_More_Revenue_From_Your_Game.php">article</a> offers additional ways to increase the number of purchases mainly Paid games by entering new distribution sites. <br><br>  1. Maximize distribution.  In addition to Google Play, there is Amazon and about 30 android app stores. <br>  2. Bundles.  Sites with bundles are great selling small paid games, collecting them in one pack.  I hope everyone at least heard about the Humble Bundle and its successes.  But he is not alone. <br>  3. Sites with daily discounts.  C sales do not help much, but they can slightly raise the load. <br>  4. Look for unconventional ways for people to find out about you.  For example, the creator of Ridiculous Fishing raised a big bucket in the media when they learned that they were redirecting users from their Twitch account to their online store and attracted a lot of attention. <br>  5. Forums and pirates.  If for Paid games they are death, then for f2p games pirates are ideal distributors if the game is really good. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/230901/">https://habr.com/ru/post/230901/</a></p>
