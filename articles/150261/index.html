  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Review of points-video recorder Camsports Coach</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"> Today it will be a question of still fresh impressions from acquaintance with such a gadget as DVR glasses.  Honestly, when Camsports Coach points were in my hands, I almost wondered why it should be done at all - a certain interest came right away.  The idea of ‚Äã‚Äãrecording my adventures almost out of sight seemed to me very interesting, for athletes and outdoor enthusiasts this device can become a revelation in the literal sense of ‚Äúunleashing the hands‚Äù.  They will also be very helpful in ‚Äúdebriefing‚Äù and analyzing errors if some kind of trouble happens.  In general, according to the first impressions - the thing from the section ‚ÄúMast hev‚Äù, it remains to get acquainted with its implementation in hardware. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/345/b93/7d5/345b937d5424529e921ebf3906bfd13a.jpg"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/054/b4f/024/054b4f02418ebf2afafc5dd4066c49e0.jpg"><br><br>  The gadget is sold in an aggressively colored cardboard box.  Package includes the following items:

    <img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/f98/e2a/d28/f98e2ad28ebbed7581aca57b6efe2c91.jpg"><br><br>  ‚Ä¢ Points <br>  ‚Ä¢ Two additional interchangeable glass sets. <br>  ‚Ä¢ miniUSB cable <br>  ‚Ä¢ 4GB microSD memory card with adapter. <br>  ‚Ä¢ Hard case. <br>  ‚Ä¢ User manual in Russian. <br><br>  As you know, the guest is met by clothes, so I will start with a cover.  In appearance, the case makes quite an unambiguous impression; it looks like a convenient and reliable storage for Camsports Coach. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/061/d9a/639/061d9a639c83a61ba5d8108de6df45f8.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/16f/7ff/b83/16f7ffb836e4e719ca2f43d6a0ea589a.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/056/372/a0b/056372a0bc705d5309fe574393f3c1ab.jpg"><br><br>  It consists of two hard halves, which a small lightning bolts between them.  Inside, the plastic halves are covered with soft material, so glasses will not be scratched against the walls of the vault.  You can fasten it on equipment either with a plastic carabiner or through a special belt loop on one side.  Among the shortcomings can be noted plastic carbine is not clear what kind of strength and the fact that the halves of the cover during compression go for each other.  So I wouldn‚Äôt sit on a closed case with glasses, they‚Äôll probably end.  Lightning between the halves also does not look very reliable, but this is already from the area of ‚Äã‚Äãquibbles. <br><br>  I figured out the case, everything is fine, but not perfect.  Now the glasses themselves.  Camsports Coach are made completely plastic, from glass to the power button.  Taking them into the hands immediately marked a good rigidity of the structure and solid performance. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/f5b/b5c/229/f5bb5c2299bd3e6b7c7ca40c16e86b93.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/d0c/8ee/714/d0c8ee714c0f30941155e8e1bc27f6c9.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/a2c/8f4/0d1/a2c8f40d1944222487d7e692efb7578a.jpg"><br><br>  The whole body of the gadget has a Soft-Touch coating, which is the place there.  To the touch Camsports Coach pleasant, the elements that touch the head, do not scratch and do not have pronounced seams in plastic.  On the points of the glasses there are rubber pads to improve the ‚Äúgrip‚Äù with the operator‚Äôs head. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/57d/c0c/21b/57dc0c21bf69b9bddbdfdc2b1b0d134f.jpg"><br><br>  Wearing glasses Camsports Coach sit on your head comfortably, like a glove, shake them off without the help of hands, I did not succeed.  Despite this, I would like to see a hole under the emergency lanyard in order to keep a valuable gadget with you in case the glasses fly away.  First of all, after trying on, I wanted to change the lenses to dark ones.  To replace, you just need to take the lens and pull over, slightly straightened frame.  No screws or latches are provided.  Lenses are fixed in the frame due to its complex shape and small protrusions.  The reliability of attachment is sufficient - they will fall out only from strong physical impact.  The quality of the plastic lenses themselves is average, there are no complaints, but you can still see better without them.  Distortions from them are present, but very small.  In the center of the frame is a camera covered with a protective glass.  We write glass - we mean plastic.  Unfortunately, this piece of plastic can not be called scratch-resistant, which can negatively affect the quality of the recorded image.  In my opinion, for a gadget worth about <a href="http://www.ulmart.ru/goods/277296/">seven thousand</a> rubles, this is one of the key points to which the manufacturer should pay close attention. <br><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/c3b/6ac/1d1/c3b6ac1d1054dba0b7c16c0f9a302453.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/d0c/8ee/714/d0c8ee714c0f30941155e8e1bc27f6c9.jpg"><br><br>  All controls and connectors are located on the right arc of points.  There are only two of them, the main one is the record on / off button, which is disguised as a red strip.  In order to start or stop recording, you just need to briefly click on it, all the rest will be done by Camsports Coach yourself.  There are no beeps at the same time, which at first is a bit annoying.  But there are two LEDs, from the inside, which are not visible when wearing glasses.  One is a two-color charge indicator, the second flashes in blue when recording is in progress.  The second button is Reset, disguised as a rubber plug.  It will allow you to lose points if something goes wrong.  The microphone is located there, there is a special hole for it.  The memory card slot and usb port are covered with rubber plugs that close tightly enough.  There is no need to talk about any serious protection from moisture, but it can help from a couple of random drops. <br><br>  Before the test, look at the characteristics from the manufacturer's website: <br><br>  ‚Ä¢ Resolution: High Definition (Real HD) 30 frames per second, (1280x720) <br>  ‚Ä¢ Camera viewing angle: advanced, 135 ¬∞, <br>  ‚Ä¢ Audio: built-in microphone <br>  ‚Ä¢ 4 GB memory card, included <br>  ‚Ä¢ Convenient stylish and durable case, <br>  ‚Ä¢ The battery provides a shooting time of up to 2 hours, <br>  ‚Ä¢ Working temperature: from -10 to +40 degrees Celsius, <br>  ‚Ä¢ A USB cable for recharging and connecting to a computer is included, <br>  ‚Ä¢ Weight: 57 grams <br><br>  Glasses are pretty simple to understand, just unscrew the three screws on each of the panels and they can be easily removed.  To my regret, it was impossible to establish what kind of hardware is used in the production of the gadget, the manufacturer simply ticked off the marking from the main chip. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/225/1d5/e2a/2251d5e2a3b3f74f7ff7a2877ee6ded0.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/088/0d0/c26/0880d0c26cf8861a5517b3110bf1260f.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/1b1/ba7/aaa/1b1ba7aaa299cf449a821257cff6496e.jpg"><br><br>  But with the battery everything is not so clear.  In the user manual enclosed in the box, we were promised an element with a capacity of 550 mAh, but inside the left-hand arc there was a significantly less capacious battery labeled as 3.7V 460mAh. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/d16/346/106/d16346106644b18e8db033608a30a677.jpg"><br><br>  Where the error has crept in: it‚Äôs unlikely to install in the Russian manual or in the battery labeling, so in the test for the battery life I will start from the real time recording. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/835/9a6/a47/8359a6a4758990fb06ab04215575a888.jpg"><br><br>  The quality of the image itself is difficult to find fault with, the Camsports Coach glasses are a rare enough product to compare them with something similar.  In general, the picture quality resembles a medium level webcam with a comparable resolution, which is quite expected.  Due to the optics of the camera, the video has a pronounced ‚Äúbarrel‚Äù at the edges of the frame. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/064/bb6/636/064bb6636c31abfd3319e5f4fa160877.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/329/4dd/cd6/3294ddcd62658abd48c29dd38fc8e71d.jpg"><br><br>  The video also has compression artifacts.  In low light conditions, the camera in glasses works pretty well, almost no noise is added.  The sound is also recorded normally, when playing back, what is happening around is audible quite clearly. <br><br>  An example of a test video in a darkened room with this instance of points: <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/qzt7GQeY5Gc%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700023,15700186,15700191,15700253,15700255,15700259&amp;usg=ALkJrhiCmVwGN61z9xxZKgRwmLO5u5wQPA" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  Testing battery life showed that these Camsports Coach points can work from one full charge for approximately 1 hour and 40 minutes, that is, within the stated time.  The test used a memory card A-Data microSDHC 32Gb Class 10. The video is written with a bitrate of ~ 7.4 Mbps, so if you do not plan to store a large amount of footage in glasses - use a memory card more than 4-8GB of special need not, ‚Äúeight ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs no longer possible to fill in with one battery charge.  When recording for a long time, the board inside the case heats up a little, but this does not cause any inconvenience to the user. <br><br>  Final impressions.  Camsports Coach points, despite some flaws in performance, remain an attractive gadget, with a bunch of interesting application features that will depend mainly on the imagination of the operator.  After several days of intensive use, for me they continue to be an interesting and useful thing that does not get tired after five minutes.  All the declared functions work well, the glasses are quite capable of recording a video that can amuse or surprise your acquaintances.  What, in general, from them and required. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/150261/">https://habr.com/ru/post/150261/</a></p>
