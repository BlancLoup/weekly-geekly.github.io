  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Yury Luzhkov already knows how to repurpose a casino</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  At a meeting of the metropolitan government, where a reading propaganda program was considered yesterday, the mayor seriously suggested converting casinos to bookstores.  ‚ÄúThere are about two thousand gambling establishments in Moscow, which we will close in the near future,‚Äù noted the mayor, proposing to create ‚Äúbook-reading centers‚Äù in their place.  ‚ÄúWho's stopping us from solving this problem?‚Äù <br><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  In the Moscow mayor's office it has already been estimated that the share of actively reading people in Russia today is 26%, which is almost below the world average.  Despite the fact that Moscow, compared to other Russian regions, still looks more enlightened, taking, according to Vladimir Zamuruev, chairman of the telecommunications and mass media committee, 7th in the number of reading population among the major megacities of the world, the quality of literature absorbed by the capital officials are not satisfied.  ‚ÄúFiction has been supplanted by gloss, in which thoughts are cramped,‚Äù said Mr. Zamuruev.  According to him, Muscovites prefer entertaining reading and functional literature to highly cultured works of art and recognized classics.  According to the relevant department, there are not enough bookstores in Moscow - now there are 292 of them, 48 of which are state-owned unitary enterprises.  One bookstore accounts for 30 thousand Muscovites, whereas in Prague there is an average second-hand bookstore for 15 thousand inhabitants, and this indicator is even higher in Budapest.

      The chairman of the Moscow City Duma Vladimir Platonov, who is part-time head of the Moscow branch of the Russian Book Union, also beat the alarm.  According to him, the number of families in which the love of reading is instilled from early childhood is inexorably decreasing.  If in the 80s children were read in 70% of Russian families, today only 6% of parents acquaint the child with a book.  In addition, the analysis of the literature itself for a minor audience causes the city committee on telecommunications and the media fears about the ‚Äúintellectual gene pool‚Äù of the capital.  Therefore, representatives of the legislative branch of power are now agitating, along with reading propaganda, for prohibitive methods of influence on the literary choice of adolescents.  ‚ÄúYoung people read a lot of obscenity magazines,‚Äù said Lyudmila Stebenkova, chairman of the Moscow City Duma health and public health commission.  Today, according to her, from periodicals, dangerous for the young consciousness, ‚Äúthe market should be freed‚Äù. <br><br>  In their search for methods of influencing Muscovites, city deputies and officials started from extreme to extreme.  In addition to the aforementioned idea of ‚Äã‚Äãthe mayor to repurpose casinos, there were suggestions to print quotes from Agnes Barto and Samuel Marshak on packages of sweets, advertise books on billboards along city streets, and link the production of printed materials to television series.  The inspired rescuers of the gene pool, capable of mastering any budget for their programs, even had to be cooled by city financiers.  ‚ÄúThe promotion of reading provided for 622.1 million rubles.  for 2007‚Äì2008, but there is not a single project of extrabudgetary funding, ‚Äùrecalled Yury Roslyak, head of the city‚Äôs economic policy and development complex. <br><br>  In general, the program of propaganda of reading, which also includes a banal allocation of funds for the purchase of literature for city and school libraries, was approved by members of the Moscow government as a ‚Äúfish‚Äù, which should be finalized within a month taking into account all the proposals, the most important of which are to interest publishers and printers.  ‚ÄúThere is a business that wants to participate in the expansion of the book trade,‚Äù said Yuri Luzhkov, ‚Äúand the budget needs to be spent on expanding and expanding libraries.‚Äù <br><br>  Source: <a href="http://dengin.ru/">Dengin.ru</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/3713/">https://habr.com/ru/post/3713/</a></p>
