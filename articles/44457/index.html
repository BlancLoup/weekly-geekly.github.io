It so happened that today Habr experienced a very real update, which brought us all three nice things: the distribution of invites, the separation of blogs and favorite tags.  In addition, some bugs, glitches and shortcomings were corrected (as well as new ones were probably added, where without them), and also a partial refactoring of the code was made. <br><br>  But first things first. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h5>  <b>Invites</b> </h5><br>  Invites with us, as you know, <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/ilhh/43144/">appeared on October 24</a> , but so far no one really knew how they are distributed and how to earn them.  So right now, I'll tell you everything.  So, now you can get an invite: <br><br>  - for every 50 points of karma (50, 100, 150, etc.) <br>  - for the post in the profile blog *, who collected 50 or more votes ** <br>  - at the sudden request of a UFO <br>  <sup>* what is a profile blog, I will say a little below</sup> <br>  <sup>** the rule is valid from November 13, 2008</sup>

      As soon as the user receives an invite, a notification immediately arrives at the post office, and since then no one and nothing can take away this invite from the user.  However, it must be remembered that there is an invisible connection between the inviting person and the invited person, so giving an invite to just anyone is more expensive. <br><br><h5>  <b>Profile blogs</b> </h5><br>  This is a kind of experiment, the results of which directly affect the further development of Habr's personalization for each user.  That is, the system is not perfect, sometimes it may not be the most convenient, but we tried to make it work well and for the benefit of everyone.  In general, now all blogs are conditionally divided into two types: <br><br>  - oftopik: blogs having a very mediocre relation to the main topic of Habr and not having it at all, as well as <i>some</i> blogs dedicated to Habr himself.  Topics in them are visible only to subscribers; <br>  - profile: blogs that are directly or slightly distantly related to the main topic of Habr.  Topics in them are visible to all. <br><br>  The first type includes blogs "Humor", "Proverbs", "Politics", "I Habrahabr" and others.  To the second - all the rest :) It is possible that some blogs will change their status from time to time.  Affiliation of a blog to one of two types is determined automatically by a very tricky scheme and rather strongly depends on which posts prevail in the blog.  This means that if (all of a sudden!) In the Politics blog posts about polytechnologies on the Internet and political start-ups will actively appear, then after a while this blog will move from oftopica to ‚Äúprofile‚Äù.  The reverse is also true.  You can see what type of blog is relevant when writing a topic.  And yes, publications in oftopikovyh blogs are not visible to logged-in users, do not participate in ratings and, as a result, in some contests. <br><br>  The difference between the two types of blogs is that all users see posts in a profile blog (unless the post is hidden by the author independently), and posts in an offtopic blog can be seen only by those who subscribe to it.  Thus, those who, say, do not want to see "Humor on Habrahabr", simply unsubscribe from it and become happy.  Hooray!  In the end, all the posts and blogs as they were, and remain in place, just some of them are visible only to subscribers of relevant blogs.  In other words, the author used to be able to ‚Äútamp down‚Äù the post independently, and now oftopic posts are ‚Äúplugged‚Äù by default. <br><br>  Why did we do this?  In order for Habr to fill in with profile content, develop in the right direction and not turn into not understand what. <br><br><h5>  <b>Favorite tags</b> </h5>  (telling <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/users/rossomachin/" class="user_link">rossomachin</a> ) <br><br>  Another cool new feature is the tag cloud, which is now visible in the profiles of many of you.  Its essence is that tags from those topics that you add to get into this cloud by a certain algorithm.  It is easy to guess that this cloud is very similar to a cloud of interests.  Now this information is visible to all.  By the way, the cloud may produce at first glance rather strange results, but this is a temporary phenomenon :) <br><br>  In the near future, this thing will gracefully help us develop the site, based on how you work with it, again moving towards reasonable personalization. <br><br>  By the way, we want to thank especially Denis Egorov ( <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/users/ur001/" class="user_link">ur001</a> ) for the ideas and implementation. <br><br><h5>  <b>miscellanea</b> </h5><br>  In addition to all the above, we fixed many bugs (thanks to <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/users/dizews/" class="user_link">dizews</a> ), conducted partial refactoring of the code (thanks to <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/users/mdevils/" class="user_link">mdevils</a> ), and updated the parser (thanks to <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/users/ur001/" class="user_link">ur001</a> ).  All this made it possible to somewhat improve the usability of the site, reduce the load and speed up its loading.  In particular, now Habr is loaded much faster on mobile browsers, and the check of filled forms is now performed on the client side. <br><br>  Behind this all! </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/44457/">https://habr.com/ru/post/44457/</a></p>
