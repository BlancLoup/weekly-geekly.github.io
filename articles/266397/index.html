We outgrow our own predictions, that's cool!  A new interview with the speaker - <b>Andrei Kumanyaev</b> , the developer of COUB. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/279/c5e/401/279c5e401e643de849b84573aadab1c3.jpg" alt="image"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  <b>How did you get into Ruby development?</b> <br><br>  I came to the world of Ruby from the world of PHP.  Then Ruby was not fashionable (at least in our town) and I heard about him not long before the junior ruby ‚Äã‚Äãprogrammer got a job.  And then I learned about all the delights of this language.  Since then, more than 3 years have passed, and ruby ‚Äã‚Äãand RoR have not disappeared from my toolkit.

      <b>What are you working on right now?</b> <br><br>  I don‚Äôt see any point in talking about where I work.  But about the fact that we in a small team, especially for RailsClub, write the service for profiling production Rails applications, is worth mentioning.  Yes, there are analogues of what we do, but everything we do will be in OpenSource.  It is important for us that people understand how such things work from the inside.  We hope that there will be those who want to join, make their contribution to the development of the project and help make life easier for the same developers as we are.  How it will work will tell at the conference.  And ... it would be great if we manage to bring it to the ‚Äúnot ashamed to show‚Äù state :) <br><br>  <b>In your opinion, in what direction will Ruby and Ruby on Rails develop in the coming years?</b> <br><br>  I wish they worked more on productivity.  For the last six months, I have repeatedly returned to the profiling of the rail stack and the application code.  Much that I saw makes me very upset. <br><br>  <b>What, in your opinion, is the most important problem that the Ruby and Ruby on Rails developers community is facing now?</b> <br><br>  Sometimes I get the feeling that they are trying to smelt a silver bullet from Ruby on Rails.  Naturally, it will not lead to anything good.  When I met Ruby on Rails, he then seemed to me too heaped up, but everything was clear.  Now I understand that then it was simple, and the level of abstractions is growing every year and after some time, articles about ‚ÄúBlog on RoR in 15 minutes‚Äù will look ridiculous in front of a monstrous framework.  I could be wrong, but I got the impression that the developers of Ruby on Rails want to give maximum syntax sugar and chips that can be useful at the very beginning of the development of the project.  But about how to live with it and what the life of a programmer who supports a large project turns into, somehow no one thinks.  And the most important issue is that Ruby on Rails gives you too much freedom, which you have to pay for later. <br><br><br>  <b>What is missing in Rails?</b> <br><br>  Rails is not good enough to support large projects.  For example, when there is a question of scaling a project, many questions and problems arise. <br><br><br>  <b>Favorite programming language after Ruby, why him?</b> <br><br>  I love Erlang, lately I have been looking at Rust more and more. <br><br><br>  <b>What is open source for you?</b>  <b>What projects are you participating in and why?</b> <br><br>  OpenSource means a lot to me. <br>  First, when someone puts his code in the public domain, he will certainly change the world for the better. <br>  Secondly, looking at the project code, I see how ‚Äúdifferently‚Äù one can implement this or that functionality.  And the more examples you see, the more widely you look at solving problems that come to you every day.  In the end, it's easier for you to make the right choice. <br>  Thirdly, OpenSource is an excellent platform where you can express yourself.  The more you work on opensource projects, the more people know you and this often plays into the hands.  You can ask for help if you get into a dead end and you will certainly be helped by good advice.  In the programming world, people like open people who are not afraid to share their experiences. <br><br><br>  <b>Best read book on programming / technology?</b> <br><br>  I would like to quote the book ‚Äú <a href="http://www.ozon.ru/context/detail/id/4341360/">Purpose.</a>  <a href="http://www.ozon.ru/context/detail/id/4341360/">The process of continuous improvement</a> ‚ÄùGoldratt.  After reading this book (and its continuation), I began to look at everyday things differently.  In my opinion, this is another book in the list of Mastrids for everyone (including, necessarily, programmers). <br><br><br>  <b>What advice would you give to developers who want to achieve great success?</b> <br><br>  It is important not to be afraid to make mistakes, and more importantly, to be able to recognize them.  Only in this way can you become a professional.  There is no point in reading books if you do not put your knowledge into practice.  Yes, and the effect of reading a number of books is manifested only if you already have experience in a particular area, so practice, practice and practice again. <br>  And, of course, always show the result of your work to someone.  Only a side view will allow you to quickly find your gaps and become better.  It does not matter who will be your mentor, colleague or participant of the opensource project, it is important that he was.  You can even help each other, each of us is stronger than a neighbor in something.  The main thing is not to be a loner. <br><br><br>  <b>Who wanted to be in childhood?</b> <br><br>  As a child, I wanted to be like my father.  Always admired him.  He worked as a forester, and I wanted to be a forester when I grew up. <br><br><br>  <b>Not tired of programming?</b> <br><br>  I am a creative person, for me programming is a way to make something out of nothing.  I don't think I ever get tired of it. <br><br>  <b>Thank you for the interview and see you at the conference!</b> <br><br>  On September 26, Andrei will give a speech at RailsClub with a report on a tool that helps to find where and why rail applications in production slow down. <br><br>  Many of the developers of the world of Ruby on Rails are familiar with a rich set of tools for profiling applications in the development environment.  Often, work with these tools ends before / after rolling out features in production.  At first, everything can work well and quickly, well, then ... how lucky. <br><br>  In the report, he will talk about how it is possible in the production environment to monitor application performance indicators and catch those cases when it starts to behave differently than we would like. <br><br>  Full program and registration <a href="http://railsclub.ru/">on our website</a> . <br><br><h4>  Our sponsors </h4><br>  General partner: <b><a href="http://www.toptal.com/">Toptal</a></b> <br>  Gold Partners: <b><a href="https://cloudcastle.ru/">Cloud Castle</a></b> and <a href="http://npoprogress.com/"><b>Progress</b></a> <br>  Silver Partners: <b><a href="http://www.at-consulting.ru/">AT-Consulting</a></b> , <b><a href="https://www.honeybadger.io/">Honeybadger</a></b> and <b><a href="http://www.insales.ru/page/vacancy-ruby-on-rails">InSales</a></b> <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/53d/bb6/7eb/53dbb67eb58716a677c90d655cc8be74.jpg" alt="image"><br>  <b>InSales.ru</b> is a professional platform for creating online stores and sales, which already has more than 5,000 successful online stores.
