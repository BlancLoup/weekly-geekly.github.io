  <section class="page js-page"><h1>The dark side of SEO - Getting links from non-existent pages</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"><h2>  The dark side of power </h2><br>  Last year, the Williams Publishing House published a book by a group of authors edited by Igor Ashmanov and Andrey Ivanov <a href="http://www.optimization.ru/book/">‚ÄúWebsite Promotion in Search Engines‚Äù</a> .  Judging by the reviews, the work was not bad.  The profession of an SEO specialist is shown from an attractive enough side, and the optimization needed by everyone - customers, search engines, users who are looking for information. <br>  Against this positive background, Igor Ashmanov‚Äôs speech on the RIF looked rather unusual, in which he spoke about the upcoming <a href="http://www.optimization.ru/subscribe/178.html">deep crisis of the</a> SEO market and the negative consequences from the activities of ‚Äúoptimizers‚Äù.  The point is this. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  The phenomenon (market, profession, business) of website promotion in search engines did not arise from disinterested desire to help users find information or help search engines make better results.  It is obvious and natural that the desire of any webmaster or website owner is primarily to attract visitors to their own website.  This is normal, as is the normal desire of any person to take care of himself and his family first and only then about the stability and welfare of the society in which he lives.  But life is arranged in such a way that, in taking care of ‚Äúour own,‚Äù we almost always have to compete with ‚Äústrangers,‚Äù who also have families and desires.  As they say, ‚Äúresources are limited,‚Äù there is not enough for everyone ... <br>  In our case, the number of places on the search results page is limited, and they all have different value.  For the first position in the issue of popular requests dozens are ready to fight, but she is alone.  For Tor3 - hundreds, but only three positions.  Those wishing to get at least in Tor10 even more, but only ten places.  It is obvious that <i>any effective</i> methods will be used to win in such a struggle. <br>  Some of the effective methods of promotion in search engines in our book are either mentioned briefly or not mentioned at all.  They are very badly associated with the ‚Äúbright appearance‚Äù of SEO, as their use either cripples the search indexes or causes outrage of users who observe such search results.  There are other consequences, for example, crowding out non-commercial sites from search results, reducing the quality of the information presented on sites, the uniformity of issue in response to information requests, reducing the motivation of companies and individuals to create their own sites and replenish Runet with new information. <br>  Nevertheless, the audience is interested in such techniques, so we decided to write several articles about the ‚ÄúDark Side of the Force‚Äù.  Perhaps readers will better help present the state of the market, understand the processes occurring on it and understand why Igor Ashmanov spoke about his crisis.  Let's start a little ... <br>  * * * <br><br><h3>  Getting links from non-existent pages </h3><br>  Disputes about what is more important for the promotion of links in the top search results - texts or external links - with varying success go a long time.  Today, most experts recognize that hitting with external links provides more predictable and consistent results.  Therefore, the main question of the profession - where exactly to place links to the promoted resources? <br>  Backlink analysis is used to answer it, i.e.  pages where search engines found links to the site of interest to us.  This analysis very often leads to very entertaining results.  For example, in Yandex, on request, <a href="http://www.yandex.ru/yandsearch%3Ftext%3D%25E1%25E5%25F1%25EF%25EB%25E0%25F2%25ED%25FB%25E9%2B%25F5%25EE%25F1%25F2%25E8%25ED%25E3">free hosting</a> on the third position is a link to the website <a href="http://dama-pik.ru/">dama-pik.ru</a> .  Yandex sees about 1150 sites with links to this resource. <br>  If you look closely, in the long list of found pages we will see some kind of ‚Äúweird, long‚Äù addresses, which include the words search, send, finder, for example, <br><ul><li>  <a href="http%253A%252F%252Fdama-pik.ru%252F%253EWeb-%25F5%25EE%25F1%25F2%25E8%25ED%25E3%2B%2528%25E1%25E5%25F1%25EF%25EB%25E0%25F2%25ED%25EE%2529%253C%252Fa%253E%253Ca%2Balt%253D%250D%250A">www.volley.ru/search.php?iq=search&amp;sword=%3E%3Ca+href%3Dhttp ...</a> <br>  <a href="http%253A%252F%252Fdama-pik.ru%252F%253E%25CA%25E0%25F7%25E5%25F1%25F2%25E2%25E5%25ED%25ED%25FB%25E9%2B%25E1%25E5%25F1%25EF%25EB%25E0%25F2%25ED%25FB%25E9%2B%25E2%25FD%25E1-%25F5%25EE%25F1%25F2%25E8%25ED%25E3%2B%25F1%2B%25EF%25EE%25E4%25E4%25E5%25F0%25E6%25EA%25EE%25E9%2Bphp%2B%25E8%2BMySQL%253C%252Fa%253E%253Ca%2Balt%253D%250D%250A">sparta.crimea.com/search.php?words=%3E%3Ca+href%3Dhttp%3A%2F%2 ...</a> <br>  <a href="http%253A%252F%252Fdama-pik.ru%252F%253E%25CD%25E0%25E4%25E5%25E6%25ED%25FB%25E9%2B%25E1%25E5%25F1%25EF%25EB%25E0%25F2%25ED%25FB%25E9%2B%25E2%25E5%25E1-%25F5%25EE%25F1%25F2%25E8%25ED%25E3%252C%2B%25E1%25E5%25F1%25EF%25EB%25E0%25F2%25ED%25FB%25E9%2B%25E4%25EE%25EC%25E5%25ED%253C%252Fa%253E%253Ca%2Balt%253D%250D%250A">stomat-korolev.ru/search.php?PHPSESSID=d51f7a630acf13beed1 ...</a> <br>  etc. <br><br>  Pages are site search results, but due to a minor flaw in the error handler, the script that produces search results takes into account the html markup and allows you to place a direct link with the necessary text on that page.  In this case, these are links to the site dama-pik.ru.

It turned out to be enough to replace a piece of code in the address after the token denoting the search query <b>sword =, words = and search =</b> with such a ‚Äúphrase‚Äù: <br><br> <code>%5C%22%3E%3Ca+href%3Dhttp%3A%2F%2Fya.ru%2F%3E%D2%E0%EA+%EC%EE%E6%&lt;br&gt;ED%EE+%EF%EE%EB%F3%F7%E8%F2%FC+%E4%EB%FF+%DF%ED%E4%E5%EA%F1%E0+%&lt;br&gt;F1%F1%FB%EB%EA%F3+%F1+%ED%E5%F1%F3%F9%E5%F1%F2%E2%F3%FE%F9%E5%E9+%&lt;br&gt;F1%F2%F0%E0%ED%E8%F6%FB%3C%2Fa%3E</code> <br>  And the phrase itself is taken from the address bar of Yandex itself - pay attention to <a href="http%253A%252F%252Fya.ru%252F%253E%25D2%25E0%25EA%2B%25EC%25EE%25E6%25ED%25EE%2B%25EF%25EE%25EB%25F3%25F7%25E8%25F2%25FC%2B%25E4%25EB%25FF%2B%25DF%25ED%25E4%25E5%25EA%25F1%25E0%2B%25F1%25F1%25FB%25EB%25EA%25F3%2B%25F1%2B%25ED%25E5%25F1%25F3%25F9%25E5%25F1%25F2%25E2%25F3%25FE%25F9%25E5%25E9%2B%25F1%25F2%25F0%25E0%25ED%25E8%25F6%25FB%253C%252Fa%253E">which query</a> . <br>  As you can see, the pages where we just ‚Äúput a link to the site being promoted‚Äù, as they say, do not exist in nature.  These are site search results generated in response to a user request.  Naturally, as soon as the user closes the browser window, the page will disappear.  And, of course, there are no links to such pages, according to which the search robot can find them ... unless they are specifically placed for this purpose.  What is being done, as we have just seen.  In order for the search robot to find all these links, it is enough to create a page (link list) somewhere on a free hosting, laying out a complete list. <br>  And only in this case, these links may appear in the list of backlinks of the site.  We are not seeing a single case, but a <i>technology advancement</i> .  Questions about legality, legality, ethics remain on the conscience of those who apply it. <br><br>  In our example, more interesting statistics.  The site is in third place for a very popular request.  At the same time, 318 links from the general list of 1144 backlinks are made up of links from just such non-existent pages.  This is 28 percent, almost a third. <br>  Obviously, this technique is difficult to classify as legal means of promotion, this is the so-called <i>technical spam</i> .  But, judging by the results, it is quite efficient, this technique is actively used, and sites where there is such a possibility of installing links to a non-existent page, it‚Äôs easy to find several thousand. <br>  Author: Andrey Ivanov <br>  Source: Newsletter <a href="http://www.optimization.ru/subscribe/179.html">‚ÄúWebsite Promotion.</a>  <a href="http://www.optimization.ru/subscribe/179.html">Professional expert advice</a> </li></ul></li></ul></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/7039/">https://habr.com/ru/post/7039/</a></p>
