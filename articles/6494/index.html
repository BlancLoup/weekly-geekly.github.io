  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Skypecast: first pancake - in the "basket"</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Actually, skypkast conceived yesterday caused a stir that was completely unexpected for me.  I got a job in a cafe with fast wi-fay, laptop and my main (part-time hiking) studio.  Everything is adjusted, set up and checked.  I was worried almost like before the first broadcast on the radio.  60 seconds before the start, the Internet was lost in the cafe.  A savior daemon called me (a demon in the sense of deamon - he was apparently resident nearby), we tried to solve the problem, but nothing happened.  It was at this time that the moment was missed, but more on that later, in the conclusions. <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  After 40 minutes, I was in soap, foam and thickly red with shame, I landed at another cafe, with more or less stable Internet.  By this time, there were more than 40 people on the air, including frank rowdy and hooligans.  But more about that later in the conclusions. <br><br>  The next stage of this theater of the absurd became permanent linings with Skype.  As soon as I took power into my own hands and tried to carry out my plans, I was immediately taken out of the conference.  With this one on one I could communicate without problems.  That is, it took me out of the conference.  But more about that later in the conclusions.

      Toward the logical conclusion of this disgrace, in private correspondence, several people insistently asked me to cover up this horror, for he had gone into some kind of squabbles, swearing and noise.  I turned off the right to speak to everyone, closed the laptop, put away the microphone, finished my coffee and went to work, realizing that I had never tolerated such a fiasco in my life ... <br><br>  And now - the conclusions. <br><br>  1) Any Skypepast must be strictly controlled by the organizer.  If someone is hard to hear, someone speaks past the topic, something goes wrong - turn off the microphone immediately.  Just as in the radio.  If the listener goes the wrong way and redirect him to the right direction does not work - the listener is disconnected from the air.  To perform this item, it is necessary to monitor the situation on the air from the FIRST MINUTES. <br><br>  2) Themed skypcasts should be conducted in private.  All those who wish to receive an invitation link express their desire, describe in a few words their position, the desire to speak or just to listen.  The moderator (organizer) prepares carefully, writing down the nicknames (so as not to waste a minute searching for the right participant in the list), and builds the topic based on the submitted applications for participation.  As in the usual talk show on the radio with invited guests. <br><br>  3) Skypecasts has beta status.  Skype for Mac for half a version is older than Skype for Windows.  There may be difficulties on my side with participation in the conference.  They may also be associated with a public access point.  That is, technical preparation for broadcasting is of paramount importance.  As in any radio studio: no equipment - no air. <br><br>  Actually, the main conclusion - the theme and the idea were chosen correctly.  The tool for delivering these ideas was also chosen correctly.  But the human factor mixed all the cards, after which the cards were re-mixed with technical overlays on the side of the organizer. <br><br>  Many thanks to everyone who showed interest in skypkast.  I will invariably do it exactly as I intended.  It will be interesting, cheerful, relevant and topical.  Most likely - on the night from Friday to Saturday. <br><br>  And again, I'm sorry that it happened. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/6494/">https://habr.com/ru/post/6494/</a></p>
