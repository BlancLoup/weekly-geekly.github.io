And he will be right, as according to statistics, about 87% of this market is occupied by software products of this company. <br><br>  But, as in every large company, in the activities of 1C there is a huge number of holes and misunderstandings that make you just take up your head and ‚Äúbe in a state of prostration‚Äù on how it all still works. <br><br>  I will say right away that the quality of 1C products is currently quite good.  And if you look at the joint industry development, they are just magical.  But the price policy of the company and the way partners work are utterly disgusted. <a name="habracut"></a>

    <h4>  Fight with yourself </h4><br>  Recently, a large number of accounting startups have begun to appear that are trying to enter through the back door.  Namely, they direct their marketing campaigns to individual entrepreneurs and small firms that have difficulties in hiring full-time accountants. <br><br>  And the 1C firm is satisfied with the dumping, which is in the proposal, which can not be refused: <b>1C: Accounting.</b>  <b>Basic version.</b>  This program, which allows you to conduct almost all trading operations, is automatically updated from the Internet for free and costs only 3300 rubles.  Of course, there is a limit on one machine and on different bases for different organizations, but for small enterprises this is not necessary. <br><br>  And the most remarkable thing is that it is one of the few products that is not subject to a consolidating agreement.  It can be sold at least at the purchase price, which is mere pennies. <br><br><h5>  BUT </h5><br>  You, of course, say that the market dictates the conditions, survives the strongest and most adapted product.  If it were not for one thing ... In 2012, the marketing department of 1C provided a report, according to which the share of sales of this product became maximum, and the professional versions of the products (which bring the company a significantly higher profit ceased to be sold). <br><br>  And here comes the reference book ‚ÄúHello, we want to buy 1C‚Äù, where partners are actually forced to vyuhivat each client unreasonably expensive products, which for the most part they do not need.  And those who are still selling basic versions of the products are almost stigmatized. <br><br>  And this company calls customer-oriented approach, which is a real hypocrisy. <br><br><h4>  Three releases, three bases </h4><br>  The margin on the 1C products themselves is quite small and for this reason, local firms start to get bogged down, coming up with ‚Äúcomplex maintenance contracts‚Äù, where the customer pays for each sneeze. <br><br><h5>  By the way: </h5><br>  According to the 1C: ITS maintenance agreement, each user of the professional version of the program with an annual subscription to updates (24,000 rubles) is required to receive updates once a month for one database, regardless of how many updates there are, what the current version of the release is, and t .d  And all this can be done remotely in a few tens of minutes, if the program is without ‚Äúwhistles and caps‚Äù. <br><br>  <b>But this is not profitable.</b>  For this reason, the partners begin to invent step-by-step update of the program, begin to personally arrive at the clients office and create an imitation of vigorous activity, wasting the time of an accountant who sits out just doing nothing!  And all in order to issue an invoice for services, or to dissolve a client into a ‚Äúcomprehensive service contract‚Äù, which they simply need. <br><br>  And, of course, this is taught to beginners by special video courses with bald coaches on the background of flipcharts. <br><br>  Well, the phrase of one of the 1C service engineers can put an end to this point: ‚ÄúIf I set up the client correctly, they will not call me, and I will lose my money.‚Äù <br><br><h4>  Direct Marketing </h4><br>  In the price list of the company at the moment there are so many product names and various options that some questions on products cannot be answered even in regional 1C support centers. <br><br>  In other words.  The 1C partner company has developed a special version of 1C for the restaurant business, in which everything is in and out.  But in the sales department the restaurant owner will be advised to buy a whole set of different programs, where from each he will use a maximum of 1-2 functions.  Plus, for setting up this centipede, he will pay considerable money, and every month boys will run to him with a smile and a check for a good amount. <br><br>  And this is all due to the fact that in 1C they themselves do not know what they are selling.  More products, more confusion, less professionalism.  Great approach. <br><br>  And there is a chip with the name of the products.  We take the basic accounting, put in the box for the place of the book on the accounting directory of the entrepreneur.  This is not 1C: Accounting, this is 1C: Prednnimatel.  We put a book on taxes, this is no longer Accounting, this is already 1C: Uprosenka. <br><br>  And the prices for the same product in different candy wrappers will be different.  The steeper the name, the higher the price. <br><br><h4>  1C implementers </h4><br>  There is such a profession - to be a superman.  An implementer is a person who understands programming, knows tax and accounting, knows how to mount and lay wires, knows how to set up server equipment, understands business processes of an enterprise and knows how to suggest the optimal solution in a particular case. <br><br>  But you yourself understand that such people rarely work in 1C, which means that someone somewhere does an incomprehensible abracadabra.  And for extra time, implementers, for enterprise downtime, for extra buns, and so on, the client pays. <br><br>  Those.  it's not enough just to knock out the required software configuration from the 1C manager, you also need to ‚Äúinspire‚Äù the boys to set it up correctly.  And this job is not for the weak.  And these are all the advantages of working with 1C professionals. <br><br><h4>  Conclusion: </h4><br>  1C is a company that has a great product, but a pumping-out customer service system too.  For all errors, shoals and inaccuracies paid by the client.  All service and travel agreements are not based on practical justification.  And all this in 87% of Russian enterprises.  You can just wonder. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/215545/">https://habr.com/ru/post/215545/</a></p>
