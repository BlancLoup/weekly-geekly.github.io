It is very convenient, having searched a laptop in online stores once, to receive then a week in contextual advertising familiar pictures with attractive prices.  It is more difficult to explain to your wife that the appearance of underwear for women in the same contextual advertising is caused by the fact that you picked her a gift in half a day. <br><br>  But you can put up with it.  The concern is that much more global information about our behavior and about what we transmit and save is accumulated and can be used for completely unpredictable purposes. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  Everyone remembers the scandal with mail.ru when "completely deleted letters" surfaced in the boxes of other users.

      As it turned out, the cars that drove and took pictures of the streets also scanned the environment for WiFi, recording poppies and SSID (this alone surprised me).  And by a completely innocent coincidence, in addition to the fully documented ability to write poppies, they used an undocumented feature and wrote all the intercepted traffic ... <br><br>  At the same time, Google‚Äôs statement that all this was not known for three years of operation of the system in a heap of cities looks very strange.  It is clear that the pictures generate a large amount of information and the intercepted traffic against its background is not enormous, but the graphic data and the intercepted information have a slightly different structure, which does not give grounds for optimistic confidence that such a ‚Äúmistake‚Äù was single and random. <br><br>  [Changes, advised to clarify that the second part of the humor.  He did not delete, so that at least it was clear what he left for mine] <br>  I propose to work out a set of recommendations to Google, what to do if in some way someone‚Äôs private information is at the company's disposal. <br><br>  My suggestions: <br><ul><li>  Copy all data will be copied to one place and solemnly destroyed, vowing never to use any of the backup copies of this data. </li><li>  Download this data back to users via their own WiFi. </li><li>  Mail the printed captured data with an apology. </li><li>  Create a new Google trash service so that all users can set up the transfer of all data directly to Google, in order to save on cars that are forced to travel around the cities and collect this data. </li><li>  Put all the data in public, so that they cease to be public and the question would be removed by itself. </li></ul><br><br>  Here is a bootleg turned‚Ä¶ <br><br>  PS More and more often I think that the minimum security requirement is a VPN, and always and everywhere: ( <br><br>  [Add] <br>  It is a pity that the main idea went unnoticed amid the joke.  Really, nobody cares what happens to your data.  And will not care.  You and only you can try to somehow minimize the risks using these or other means of protection.  In the modern information society, anything can become the property of the public or those who can use this information.  Fraud is the easiest way to use your information against you.  Information allows you to manipulate both individuals and the community.  What is happening around us clearly shows that information management provides unlimited possibilities. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/94171/">https://habr.com/ru/post/94171/</a></p>
