It happens that interesting stories are made up.  One of them is below. <br><br><h4>  Story </h4><br>  So, I taught students the IT translation, we analyzed the switch device and the marketing booklet to it, we came across one interesting offer.

      I love these - they seem to have a second bottom.  The original looked like this: <br><br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/uf/kf/xu/ufkfxumdxpv09hooky4idnt2ykc.png"></a> <br><br><a name="habracut"></a>  Formally, the student translators more or less coped with it: <br><br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/nv/qm/ci/nvqmcip8_4pgqc1sceuubj9sg5u.png"></a> <br><br>  And yet I did not like the translations, I did not immediately realize why. <br><br>  The first question I asked was - <br><blockquote>  <strong>How do the signal power and NETGEAR Green relate to each other?</strong> </blockquote><br><br><br>  The logic began to crumble almost immediately, since the meaning was that the manufacturer boasted not that the signal power would be less, but that with a shorter cable length the power consumption would be lower.  And this already fits into the concept of <b>NETGEAR Green</b> . <br><br><br><br>  I checked my guess, 100% hit ( <a href="https://www.netgear.ru/about/environment/environmental-information/default.aspx">https://www.netgear.ru/about/environment/environmental-information/default.aspx</a> ): <br><br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/us/0g/v9/us0gv99xhckmvgdg0th-rxcaqzm.png"></a> <br><br>  But while I was looking for confirmation of my guess, I had another question: <br><br><blockquote>  ‚ÄúWhy is it actually about <b>10</b> m?  Not <b>5</b> , not <b>15</b> , not <b>25</b> , but exactly <b>10</b> ? " <br></blockquote><br><br>  Perhaps one of you will twist a finger at your temple (as one of the translator colleagues did) - and will be right in its own way: <br><br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/dh/mu/h8/dhmuh8jbqi2p2u1d1rjdev4ongm.png"></a> <br><br><br><br>  But I'm allergic to "white spots" in the text, so I continued my search. <br><br><br><br>  They led me to the <b>Green Ethernet</b> program, which was developed by several IEEE working groups.  The results of the work of these groups eventually turned into the <b>IEEE P802.3az Energy Efficient Ethernet standard</b> <em>(materials and reports can be found here - <a href="http://www.ieee802.org/3/az/public/index.html">http://www.ieee802.org/3/az/public/index.html</a> ).</em> <br><br>  Here's how it all began ( <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/224189701_IEEE_8023az_The_road_to_energy_efficient_Ethernet/download">https://www.researchgate.net/publication/224189701_IEEE_8023az_The_road_to_energy_efficient_Ethernet/download</a> ): <br><br><br><p>  <em>IEEE 802 Working Group in July 2005. This was a tutorial for many people who followed the meeting. IEEE 802.3 IEEE (CFI).</em>  <em>In November 2006, a CFI vote was given.</em>  <em>The first meeting of the EEE Study Group was held in January 2007.</em> </p><br><br><br>  There were a lot of committees; there were even more proposals to improve the efficiency of switches ‚Äî basically, they were aimed at optimizing ports ‚Äî de-energizing inactive, taking them to sleep, working in different power modes, depending on the data transfer rate, optimizing switching power consumption speeds. <br><br><br><br>  It's funny, but I didn‚Äôt find a single report on the link above that would concern cable lengths, although both Cisco and D-Link refer to the work of this group and this standard. <br><br><br><br>  <b>Cisco</b> specifically announced the <b>Short-Reach Mode</b> option ( <a href="https://www.cisco.com/assets/sol/sb/Switches_Emulators_v2_3_5_xx/help/250/index.html">https://www.cisco.com/assets/sol/sb/Switches_Emulators_v2_3_5_xx/help/250/index.html#page/tesla_250_olh/ts_port_management_09_25.html</a> ): <br><br><br><p>  <em><strong>Short-Reach Mode ‚Äî</strong> This feature provides for a short length of cable.</em>  <em>It has been analyzed for various cable lengths.</em>  <em>If the cable is shipped with the cable, it is saving energy.</em>  <em>This mode is only supported on RJ45 GE ports;</em>  <em>it does not apply to combo ports.</em>  <em>This mode is disabled by default.</em> </p><br><br><br>  So, the first figure appeared - <strong>30 meters</strong> . <br><br>  What does D-Link say? <br><br>  In its publication, D-Link (http://www.dlinkgreen.com/greensupplychainmanagement.asp) mentions <b>20 meters</b> already: <br><br><br><p>  <em>D-Link Green Technology Detects</em>  <em>This is a <b>cable that</b> only needs to be used for 100-meter cables.</em>  <em>If cable length is <b>less than 20 meters</b> , it can save up to 9.3% power used for each system.</em> </p><br><br><br>  It was rather strange to observe the silence on this topic of the <b>NETGEAR</b> company - it seems to have its own program, as we have seen, <b>NETGEAR GREEN</b> - and there are no details. <br><br>  I caught sight of two pieces that were suggestive. <br><br>  <strong>Short-Reach Mode</strong> in <b>NETGEAR</b> switches, it turns out, is provided <em>( <b>Cisco is</b> not alone here)</em> . <br><br>  Here is a screenshot from their guide to the switch, with more than 300 pages, where we see the mention of <strong>Short Reach Admin Mode</strong> : <br><br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/dk/5d/qk/dk5dqknkrlh-3as0xo2o57awoka.png"></a> <br><br>  Here are the explanations from this manual: <br><br><br><p>  <em>Selective <strong>Reach</strong> Admin mode.</em>  <em>With this mode enabled, it <strong>is less than a certain limit</strong> .</em> </p><br><br><br>  And yet the figure in the <strong>10 m</strong> never flashed. <br><br>  But where did she come from? <br><br>  In the end, I came across a small report ( <a href="http://www.ieee802.org/3/NGBASET/public/jan13/WuParnaby_01a_0113_NGBT.pdf">http://www.ieee802.org/3/NGBASET/public/jan13/WuParnaby_01a_0113_NGBT.pdf</a> ) within the framework of the IEEE 802.3 committee (dealing with Ethernet issues), in particular there is such a slide: <br><br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/ti/v8/-m/tiv8-m_11r1a6wdbojcw0nb8s2c.png"></a> <br><br>  Yeah, the figure in <strong>10 m</strong> appeared - the research began with it. <br><br>  It is precisely she who shows us that for transmitting a signal over a <strong>10 m</strong> cable, <b>65-85%</b> of the energy that would be required for transmission over a <strong>100 m</strong> cable will be required. <br><br>  This, by the way, opens up a veil for another translation puzzle, over which interpretation I also puzzled: <br><br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/xt/9h/jg/xt9hjgic6n0zugsulx-qenl2iwq.png"></a> <br><br>  Consumption <strong>down 60%</strong> ?  Or has it dropped <strong>to around 60%</strong> ? <br><br>  Translating students were not unanimous either: <br><br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/9b/mv/gk/9bmvgkpra1ehavlehl8sbqwct_c.png"></a> <br><br>  Well, now everything seems to be decomposed on the shelves. <br><br>  Or not everything?  No, not all, one question remains: <br><br><blockquote>  <b>Does NETGEAR have anything to do with this 10 meter cable report?</b> <br></blockquote><br><br>  Let's look at the title page of the report: <br><br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/rb/7r/cy/rb7rcye_qsvgmmiaeqfbn5crcbk.png"></a> <br><br>  Now let's see if <em>Margell Semiconductor is</em> a <em>NETGEAR</em> supplier? <br><br>  Yes!  And how it is!  They have been friends since at least <b>2003</b> (and the report was - for a minute - in <b>2013</b> ): <br><br>  Here is the publication ( <a href="https://investor.marvell.com/news-releases/news-release-details/netgear-gsm712-gigabit-ethernet-switch-utilizing-industry">https://investor.marvell.com/news-releases/news-release-details/netgear-gsm712-gigabit-ethernet-switch-utilizing-industry</a> ): <br><br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/ix/_a/je/ix_aje8lwd2fszpakirplo52isq.png"></a> <br><br>  Now, exactly <i>(as far as I can tell)</i> , everything fell into place. <br><br>  I hope it was interesting. <br><br>  <i>Respectfully,</i> <i><br></i>  <i>Eugene</i> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/449334/">https://habr.com/ru/post/449334/</a></p>
