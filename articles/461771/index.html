This is especially annoying at work, where productivity, multitasking and other positive things are expected from all sides.  A typical situation: the employee does not know and is worried, and the manager is busy and he has no time for answers.  And it happens the other way around: there is so much information that the employee is frightened of it.  And for an IT specialist this is a more recognizable situation.  But "under" or "re" is still anxiety. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/l-/n5/eh/l-n5ehehqlyyatgucodlnipqap4.png"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h1>  Kill Uncertainty: A Little Theory </h1><br>  Our world is still chaos, and the thought of this leads people to suicide.  That is why since childhood we have been trying to create around us a space of "known numbers." <br><br>  Every modern parent knows that the best way to have a calm child is to organize a routine for him.  And give surprises only as he requested.  And if you need to change something, then you should make a new plan together.  And ask for opinions.  At least for a look.

    <pre><code class="plaintext hljs">‚Äî  ,      .</code> </pre> <br>  And this scheme works for most of us at any age.  And at home, and even more so at work.  Tell me, talk to me - and I will be calm and productive!  Base.  PR and marketers add the word "illusion" to the formula.  In this form, it also works. <br><br>  Unfortunately, this base is not taught at all faculties.  And in most cases, we have to get to certainty on our own: ask questions, poke into the "black boxes", get annoyed by deafness, fantasize. <br><blockquote>  Sometimes it seems that there is almost no chaos, and the uncertainty is right there.  An employee comes to the head and asks: "What are my main tasks next month?"  And the leader told him: ‚ÄúWhy are you, the world is full of uncertainties, you need to get used to it.‚Äù  And this is not a joke. </blockquote><h1>  My child‚Äôs kindergarten: ‚Äúunder‚Äù </h1><br><pre> <code class="plaintext hljs">‚Äî       ? ‚Äî      ? ‚Äî         ? ‚Äî   ..?</code> </pre><br>  For the third year, educators have been asking these questions in a chat.  And each time, some of the most indiscreet mother replies: "Oh, and what kind of competition, we did not know."  And again, I am boringly adding: ‚ÄúPlease inform us about the activities in the chat, announcements on the stands in small print are rarely read.‚Äù <br><br>  Parent chats have been working for several years, and it is really often convenient.  But the tasks for which they are created (the very information and dialogue) are always solved in different ways. <br><br>  There are excellent examples, I am proud of them and tell everyone.  After each lesson, the teacher of the Around the World club briefly tells us what the children studied today and what their homework is.  Sometimes he sends photos.  And she does it all year.  She is cool! <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/0q/pv/xs/0qpvxs3kglbn5pxl6ohletqvpaw.png"><br><br>  Of course, I am in the know about loading educators.  But after all, with the help of timely (!) And complete (!) Information, they can more effectively attract parents to their tasks, to the tasks of the group, without fuss on the penultimate day ... <br><br>  No need for weekly dashboards, these are cherries for IT people.  You just need to timely inform about everything important.  And remember that in a timely manner is at least two times: in advance and the day before. <br><br>  <b>What to do?</b>  The main problem here is the lack of chat room etiquette.  No rules.  Educational institutions have not yet managed to incorporate technology into their regulations.  A matter of time.  Therefore, it remains to wait, modestly prompt and praise the pioneers. <br><br><h1>  The management company of my house: "under" </h1><br>  Management style: mumble :-) Or ignore.  Questions are poured into the chat, the manager answers one of ten, in the official group of the social network "Vkontakte" reports on the work done are not laid out.  People are worried, because payments come monthly, and his questions are ignored. <br><br><pre> <code class="plaintext hljs">‚Äî     , ‚Äî       .        .</code> </pre><br>  Silence always creates a negative from which sooner or later a revolution or some very pumped-up lawyer is born.  Even if the city is divided between the UK and it is almost a monopoly. <br><br>  UK, be a politician and focus public attention on the color of the urn.  The main thing is that people have information.  So that people know / think that they know what awaits them.  Only information should always be (!) - a one-time distraction to the ballot boxes will make us even more angry. <br><br>  Here is how the Criminal Code discusses with me: <br><br><pre> <code class="plaintext hljs">‚Äî   ,  ;    .</code> </pre><br>  I am an idealist, I suggested Trello to my UK.  Trello is still there.  Although here is a spokesperson, they say that the state also has contests in VK hacks.  Someone was offering Slack.  Today I tested voting in Google polls.  And on Saturday, I personally went to the manager, interviewed him and posted a squeeze on the chat.  The salvation of drowning people is the work of the drowning people themselves. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/eg/qt/ao/egqtaos-ckgyukmu_6yxd773lps.png"><br><br>  Alas, communication theory is not taught where housing and communal services workers study, now what. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/h_/ip/nm/h_ipnmulalr-pdll61bw1tkrtfw.png"><br><br>  Oh, I wish we had another Teamer.  Basic, neat. <br><br>  <b>What to do?</b>  Housing and communal services for the most part is definitely not about the 21st century, although in some Khrushchevs after overhaul smart intercoms begin to be installed.  But informing them for some reason is always an attempt on the opacity of financial flows, and this is still completely impossible.  What to do?  Again: wait, modestly prompt and praise the pioneers. <br><br><h1>  My IT company: nedo vs pere </h1><br>  More and more often: ‚ÄúYes, you got me with your corporate portals, news, and you‚Äôre getting into my telegrams!‚Äù <br><br>  And, shhhh, no one remembers what it was like in the era of the ‚Äúpre-portal‚Äù.  Because it was quiet.  Who needs it, he found out.  And he said to his neighbor: and away we go.  And if the portal has been almost a week already and the ‚Äúmirrors‚Äù are not working? !!! <br><br>  But the presence of a portal and stands, even gamified, does not guarantee a reduction in personal work uncertainty.  Because: <br><br><ul><li>  <b>HUMAN FACTOR: ‚ÄúI DO IT, I DO NOT SPEAK‚Äù</b> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/is/z3/bt/isz3btxw9bfr2ekkrwg9rassrjw.png"><br><br>  There are such people (and they are also leaders, which means they are the main news makers), who, due to the nature of their nature, tend to appropriate information. <br><br>  For someone, value is to share this information.  So they feel fuller, because they are useful / interesting to society.  And someone becomes ‚Äúfuller‚Äù from the fact that he accumulates this information.  Such people give it out only upon request.  Sometimes - persistent.  If such people fall into leadership and communication positions, then organizing the information process becomes not an easy task. <br><br>  There are still executives who do not see business value in saying something to someone.  Why chat, things are moving.  And it seems to employees that they are ignored. <br><br>  At the same time, the general process of informing can be customized in the company, but the human factor ensures slippage. <br><br>  <b>What to do?</b>  Change a responsible person.  As a rule, the absence of a ‚Äúsense of information‚Äù is not treated. </li><li>  <b>HAZEL OF BUSINESS PROCESS</b> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/q9/az/kg/q9azkgivmsaopj42xr8_jxakbwg.png"><br><br>  Often, all the turbidity is due to the fact that the process simply does not have an owner: a specialist who will formally and informally ‚Äúroot‚Äù for the effectiveness of the entrusted. <br><br>  Another common problem is the fear of the difficulty of organizing the process itself so that it is truly quality.  Have you described how the ‚Äúblack box‚Äù with feedback works? .. And are the feedback results visible? .. Do you know how long key contracts your company has? .. <br><br>  Yes, we must come to terms that the implementation of the communication process can be expensive.  Like any other.  And it‚Äôs better not to reinvent the wheel, but to call specialists.  To lower the budget. <br><br>  <b>What to do?</b>  Find the owner for the communication process from communication specialists and give him the opportunity to work. </li><li>  <b>OVERLOAD INFORMATION</b> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/kg/hb/rb/kghbrbokcezgrjkywj8c6gzi1gg.png"><br><br>  There is a great temptation to set up the information process once and not change it anymore.  First of all, budget owners can hardly make changes in the company's information system: what is the business value of replacing green buttons with red ones?  As a result, the employee gets bored with all the visuals and tools, and there is more and more information every day.  As a result, the employee simply disconnects from the stream, ignoring everything. <br><br><pre> <code class="plaintext hljs">‚Äî    ! ‚Äî    ,      .</code> </pre><br>  <b>What to do?</b>  Change ergonomics and clean content.  Regularly.  To start with the fact that to dissolve information at a mandatory minimum and all else.  Recall that the good old cascading works better than any portal. </li></ul><br><blockquote>  <b>HYGIENIC INFO LEVEL FOR COMPANIES &lt;100 EMPLOYEES</b> <br><br>  In small companies, the head is the main celebrity, the owner of budgets and a great example.  Therefore, it is worth trying to include it in the communication process at all levels. <br><br>  What should an ideal leader do? <br><br>  - Broadcast: where was the business, where now, where are we moving, why and why is all this movement. <br>  - Talk about what specific employee can do for a business. <br>  - Ask the employee a question about how he sees the business and himself in the business. <br><br>  All this is regular.  As a result of broadcasting, public meeting notes in the form of a todo-list. <br><br>  And for this to happen, you need to go through 3 steps.  These steps can only be done by communication fans (by position or temperament). <br><br><ol><li>  Understand why the leader does not want / cannot evaluate the power of information + convey this value to him. </li><li>  Define a format for information and dialogue (and the owners of these activities!): <br>  - monthly / quarterly meeting reports; <br>  - blog / news; <br>  - video conferencing. <br></li><li>  Define the format of attention to the employee: <br>  - 1 on 1; <br>  - lunch / smoking room; <br>  - ‚Äúhot lines‚Äù. <br></li></ol><br>  Yes, again about the base, sorry.  Why do I need your gamification with contests if I don‚Äôt know what‚Äôs going on with my project in a month? </blockquote><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/7n/jr/pn/7njrpnngyqq2ejtimpmih1qxkc0.png"><br><br><h1>  Summary </h1><br>  A sense of uncertainty is always about stress.  Wherever we catch him: at home, at work, in search of a price tag on a window display.  And we are constantly looking for a middle ground between "silent" and "chattering." <br><br>  In general, far from everywhere, sophisticated and complex branched portals and trackers are needed.  Very often you just need ONE special place with the functions ‚Äúpublish‚Äù and ‚Äúcomment‚Äù.  Another ‚Äúvote‚Äù would be.  And from time to time to look at the instrument with a fresh look and tighten up.  Well, the one who would love all this. <br><br>  In short, I‚Äôm looking for a simple service for these three tasks.  So that in IT startup, and in kindergarten, and in HOA.  Throw links, please! </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/461771/">https://habr.com/ru/post/461771/</a></p>
