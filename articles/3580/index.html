  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Mortgage answers.</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Now he answered the questions of a journalist respected by me and thought that perhaps the answers would be interesting to you too.  Let it turn out a little pop and short, but such ‚Äúmortgage loan bases‚Äù can be interesting. <br><br>  <b>Which borrowers are most desirable for bankers?</b>  <b>Why?</b>  <b>What does it depend on?</b> <b><br></b>  <b>Is it possible to describe the portrait of the ideal borrower?</b> <br><br>  The most desirable is the borrower who is likely to be able to repay the loan.  This, in general, is obvious.  Everywhere will be glad to the borrower with a completely white income, but it is quite normal to react to gray, with certain parameters of the borrower.  If we consider in more detail, interesting are hiring male specialists under 35 years of age who have experience in the current industry, who have been promoted and have high qualifications, confirmed by specialized education and other professional diplomas or certificates.

    <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  <b>What factors primarily affect the decision of the bank to issue a mortgage loan?</b>  <b>What pay attention besides salary?</b>  <b>Why?</b>  <b>What gives bankers an account of these factors?</b>  <b>Do bankers pay attention to the position of the client, the prospect of growth?</b> <br><br>  The degree of income confirmation is of interest first.  Those.  starting from fully official, then confirmation from the manual, verbally by the management, and so on, and ending with a completely black business. <br>  Also pay attention to the salary and qualifications.  Those.  A person who is currently receiving $ 2,000 must be able to receive no less when moving to another company.  This means that the driver with an income of $ 4,000 will most likely not be given a loan, or will be given a smaller amount based on the average driver's salary from the point of view of a bank employee.  Same with a secretary with a salary of $ 3,000. <br>  It is also important that there is a profession and qualification, i.e.  so that a person dismissed for any reason could find a job within a reasonable time without loss of income.  Therefore, they do not like professions that do not require special skills and with a high rotation of personnel (waiters, croupiers, etc.). <br>  The bank is important not only how much is the borrower's income at the time of taking the loan, but also how stable this income will be in the future. <br><br>  <b>For example, how important is the age of the borrower?</b>  <b>How does this affect the decision of the bank?</b>  <b>And marital status?</b> <br><br>  Age is usually interested in terms of the proximity of the pension.  Those.  at the time of repayment of the loan to the borrower should be no more than the age limit established by the bank.  Usually it is 60 years old.  Although there are exceptions, for example, for business owners.  Marital status is more interested in the plane of the presence or possible appearance of children.  Read the dependents.  Those.  a young married couple without children may be given a little less credit than a single man without children, but with the same income as the total for a couple.  They can also take a closer look at the assessment of the solvency of a young childless woman.  But this is not the rule, but depends more on the bank. <br><br>  <b>A borrower who can hardly rely on a mortgage loan, even with high wages?</b>  <b>Why?</b> <br>  See for example with a secretary or a driver. <br>  If the current income of the borrower is much higher than the industry average for his position, then they can cut the loan amount, or refuse at all.  The same situation when the income is within the framework, but the qualification is not sufficient for the position.  Sometimes it happens that it does not have a higher education, but an intelligent specialist grows well within the company, but he may be reduced in the amount of the loan due to the fear that he will not be able to apply for another position in another company. <br><br>  <b>Is it possible to somehow divide potential borrowers into groups?</b>  <b>Do you have any classification?</b> <br><br>  Yes, there is a classification.  We use the main factor - type of income confirmation.  Those.  employee with white income;  an employee with an income confirmed by a certificate from the management;  an employee with an income confirmed by oral guidance;  employee with an income not confirmed in any way;  a business owner with a fully formal income;  a business owner with minimal official income and ‚Äúdifficult cases‚Äù :) Difficult cases are, for example, an artist who does not sell paintings and receives income from a sponsor or a girl without official work, qualifications and with ‚Äúincome‚Äù from a ‚Äúpatron‚Äù.  Although, the rates here are from 15% in currency already. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/3580/">https://habr.com/ru/post/3580/</a></p>
