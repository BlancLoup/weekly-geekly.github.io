      If you dig deeper, then in psychology there is a narrower concept - the <b>motivation to achieve</b> .  This type of motivation determines whether a person will win, or be content with secondary roles, will he strive for growth, or find a comfortable place for himself from where he will be taken to the cemetery after N years and quickly forgotten. <br><br>  The creator of the subspecies, G. Murray, spoke of the following motivation to achieve: <br><br><blockquote>  <i>‚ÄúDealing with something difficult.</i>  <i>Deal with, manipulate, or organize physical objects, people, or ideas.</i>  <i>Do this as quickly and independently as possible.</i>  <i>Overcome obstacles and reach a high level.</i>  <i>Surpass yourself.</i>  <i>Compete with others and excel them.</i>  <i>Increase your self-esteem through the successful application of their abilities "</i> <br></blockquote><br><br>  Motivation to achieve can be developed due to certain character traits: <br><br>  1) Hardness - consistency and perseverance in achieving goals or upholding views (character trait of the Jedi). <br>  2) Ambitiousness - a passion for achievement, fame and recognition by other people (Sith character trait). <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/223/ef0/661/223ef06616445f99b83329e30f1fa0d5.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  And it's cool if you don‚Äôt have to strain yourself on that score, and you have inborn traits like the opposing forces of the Star Wars universe. <br><br>  If this is not the case, then the achievement motivation can be developed by the action of external forces, for example, by the <b>‚Äúteacher-mentor‚Äù</b> force. <br><br>  In order not to turn the article into a mortal boredom, I decided to transfer myself to a fictional space business university, and to show you why learning from well-known experts is more effective than learning from just an intelligent teacher. <br><br>  For example, in this fantastic school there are 3 teachers. <br><br>  Item - the ability to conduct business negotiations. <br><br>  The first teacher is a new model of the robot, which correctly, consistently and affordably presents the material, and correctly answers students' questions. <br><br>  The second teacher is an elderly lecturer, who is known for having already released 20 student streams, and there is no doubt about his teaching skills. <br><br>  The third teacher is a guest guest, the main sponsor of the university, the owner of a space shipyard and a descendant of the founder of the first space business club. <br><br>  So which of them should learn from the point of view of obtaining better knowledge? <br><br>  ... <u>absolutely no difference</u> , and even more - all these teachers are easily replaced: <br>  - A shabby book with the same information ... <br>  - One of the students with a report containing the same information ... <br>  - Even a pornographic film in which the plot will be built on the materials of lectures ... <br><br>  Theoretical information or even practical training is the basis that is needed before moving on to combat practice and turning knowledge into skills and abilities. <br><br>  What is really important? <br><br>  <b>What matters is a positive growth in student achievement motivation.</b> <br><br>  You need motivation to spend your time and energy on the exercises, and building up professional muscles.  We need faith that the teaching material will bring the student closer to the achievements of the lecturer himself. <br><br>  For a student to be self-confident and not afraid to practice in business negotiations, we need ambitions that would make him feel superior to others, or at least on equal terms.  A successful story of other people is a guarantee of our own movement. <br><br>  A greater positive growth in achievement motivation will be observed under the influence of a <b>third teacher</b> .  Anyone who is an authority with combat experience, who has proven in practice that this knowledge can be applied and become the largest businessman, is more likely to instill confidence in the audience. <br><br>  Here are some examples from the real world: <br><br>  - Photoshop expert performing orders for Hollywood, motivates course participants to continue classes, telling about themselves, revealing the poster design market, throwing insider information about opportunities, contests, and focusing on acquiring practical skills. <br><br>  - Bodybuilding expert, one of the champions in his state, shows himself at 19, and at 29, with a difference of 40 kilograms of muscle mass, without the use of nuclear chemistry, and says that such results can be achieved even by a sick person. the earth. <br><br>  - An expert on creating startups, shows dozens of projects that he oversawed, tells about the strategy of attracting venture money that unites these projects, about their current state of mega-wealth, and in every way inspires confidence in the audience that there is no magic in building an investment scheme. <br><br>  All this information can be found on the net (if you try hard).  You can learn how cool to make posters in Photoshop, how to swing to crazy sizes, how to properly pass the investment rounds.  But knowledge alone is not enough.  We need people who will hysterically urge to make upheavals in their lives, achieve success, and trample down all doubts on a personal cool example. <br><br>  That is why we, on LendWings, put achievements and regalia of experts on a pedestal. <br><br>  Thank you very much.  Platform release is expected in two to three weeks. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/187548/">https://habr.com/ru/post/187548/</a></p>
