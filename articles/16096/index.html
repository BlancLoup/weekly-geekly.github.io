  <section class="page js-page"><h1>User Experience 2007: first pancake, but not lumpy</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  The <a href="http://userexp.ru/">User Experience Russia</a> conference for usability professionals and all sympathizers, <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blog/ui_design_and_usability/27755.html">held</a> at the end of last week in the chic interiors of the Radisson SAS Slavyanskaya Hotel in Moscow, showed a great interest of business and the public to this, still new to Russia, industry.  <strong>Dmitry Volkov</strong> , CEO of <a href="http://it-online.ru/">IT-Online</a> , the organizing company of the event, believes that everything went well.  And, by and large, it is difficult to disagree with this conclusion.  Interesting reports from interesting speakers, both domestic and foreign, fell on the heads of participants one by one.  But the main component was, of course, communication with colleagues, opportunities for which we still have a large deficit. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  As Dmitry said, the results of the conference even exceeded the initial expectations.  What was initially planned as a celebration of <a href="http://www.worldusabilityday.ru/">World Usability Day</a> on November 8th, received so many responses from the interested public that the program had to be stretched for three days.  ‚ÄúAbout 550 people expressed their desire to participate in the conference, to cover it.  It seems to me that this is an indicator of a trend.  Some time ago, sites were created in order to like top management.  Today, obviously, not only aesthetics, but also convenience are important in order that users can achieve their goals, and Internet businesses can turn users into their customers.  Therefore, the topic of usability is now very relevant, and this conference will allow us to unite efforts, get together, talk about our projects and, in general, increase our awareness, literacy and professionalism, ‚Äùhe says. <br><br>  In addition to communication between professionals, the important role of the exhibition is to draw public attention to usability as an integral part of any product.  Now the demand for user-friendly interfaces is already growing, but there is still a huge field for speculation, when instead of a serious approach to the question, the user is offered beautiful words, demanding, however, much more money. <br><br>  A leg up with the dispelling of myths should be trained by specialists, since there will soon be no one to satisfy that very demand for ergonomics and usability professionals.  Today in Russia, courses that prepare specialized specialists can be counted on one hand.  Inviting foreign experts to conduct seminars, workshops that are held by the only <a href="http://edu.it-online.ru/">edu-itonline</a> training center have a tangible impact on the <a href="http://edu.it-online.ru/">development of a</a> professional environment, but such a vast body of knowledge and skills that the science of usability operates on has long required transferring to the ground classical higher education .  <strong>Maria Stone</strong> , managing usability at Google, is convinced that the first university to offer a program for preparing usability will gain fame and honor.  We had a <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blog/ui_design_and_usability/30085.html">short interview with</a> Maria.

      I managed to attend the second, most intense, day of the conference.  Everything was interesting, the speakers spoke at once in two, or even in three halls at the same time, so choosing where to go and where not to go was not easy.  At first I got into the section ‚ÄúUsability on the Internet‚Äù, which Gennady Dragun from <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/epam/">EPAM</a> <a href="http://www.userexp.ru/speakers/dragun/report/">started</a> vividly and meaningfully.  He was followed by <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/users/wklim/" class="user_link">wklim</a> Vladimir Klimentev and <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/users/melfa/" class="user_link">melfa</a> Mikhail Elfimov, who were supposed to tell about usability in social networks, but according to the vague feeling left after the report, they told about social networks in general.  What, however, inexplicably raised the mood of the audience.  Then a stormy applause broke an extremely interesting <a href="http://www.userexp.ru/speakers/moshkov/report/">report</a> <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/users/yomka/" class="user_link">yomka</a> Artem Moshkov from <a href="http://www.spbnet.ru/">SPBNET</a> . <br><br>  After that, I moved to another room, where <a href="http://www.qsoft.ru/">QSOFT</a> General Director <a href="http://www.userexp.ru/speakers/tokovinin/about/">Mikhail Tokovinin was</a> just beginning his <a href="http://www.userexp.ru/speakers/tokovinin/report/">speech</a> (by the way, hellishly similar to young Steve Jobs).  Taking away some time from dinner (none of the listeners, however, did not stir, despite the rumbling in their bellies here and there), Mikhail gave advice to those who want to spend the last $ 10 thousand on usability. <br><br>  Having absorbed the long-awaited dinner (I remember it with melancholy and tenderness), I, as a professional tormentor of texts, went to improve my professional <a href="http://www.userexp.ru/speakers/chebykin/about/">ability</a> to a seminar for <a href="http://www.userexp.ru/speakers/chebykin/about/">Rostislav Chebykin</a> , who <a href="http://www.userexp.ru/speakers/chebykin/report/">told me</a> very fun and entertaining about the rules for creating a good working text.  Those not included in the oral report, but Rostislav‚Äôs thoughts on his website that usability should not be taken as something separate from the rest of the development process of anything, described in his theses would definitely be considered a subtitle of the whole event. <br><br>  In general, the conference left a very pleasant impression.  In the future, she promises to be regular, which pleases. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/16096/">https://habr.com/ru/post/16096/</a></p>
