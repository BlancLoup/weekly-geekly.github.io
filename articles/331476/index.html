How do we solve this in WebCanape?</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/0b1/05d/8e3/0b105d8e33d045c7ab7c419dfa1706ed.jpg"><br><br>  Any successful entrepreneur leads his business to a specific goal.  Due to the fact that he clearly understands this goal, he focuses on it and tries not to deviate, he easily bypasses competitors, becomes a professional and ultimately achieves results faster and better than others. <br><br>  But business is not a single game.  Teamwork is important here, which means that everyone should see and understand alike his personal goal and the goal of the company.  The less often you remind the team what you are going to, the less often you adjust intermediate tasks, the more defocusing the goals.  And with the growth of the company, this problem grows exponentially.  That is why with the expansion of the company you, as an entrepreneur, become slow and clumsy. <a name="habracut"></a>

      We clearly recognized these problems when we were over 30 people (now 90+).  At that moment I began to work seriously on the task of synchronizing the actions of the whole team around specific tasks.  And it's better than visualizing goals in the areas of constant attention of employees, I did not invent anything.  I share with you the most successful solutions from my experience. <br><br><h2>  It is terrible not to spend much, it is terrible - to earn a little </h2><br>  Constant work on increasing revenues is significantly more important than constant monitoring and reducing costs.  That is why, in the most conspicuous place, we visualize the implementation of the financial plan in the following directions. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/bf6/495/f70/bf6495f7006a44aeaa43cba43ce601f4.jpg"><br>  <i>Example of Canape CRM Plan Achievement Indicators</i> <br><br>  Despite the fact that every month our plans grow, we almost always fulfill them to the nearest thousand rubles.  This is an amazing phenomenon, the nature of which I still can not understand.  Numbers that often seem unreachable are performed with a hit of 99-101%.  Apparently a person is designed so that, seeing the goal in front of him (in the literal sense of the word), he is looking for options for achieving it.  And when the goal is clear to the whole team, including developers and administrative staff, this has an additional energy effect. <br><br>  Have you ever noticed that when you plan to wake up at a certain time, you wake up exactly according to plan, even without an alarm clock?  The brain adjusts to the task and is looking for solutions to it. <br><br>  Layfkhak with the monitor made it possible to constantly adjust the whole team to the result.  If earlier, with a stable growth of the plan, we achieved its fulfillment only in half of the cases, then already for three years from the moment of visualization of the goal we have achieved 85% of the intended result.  An ideal example of a similar approach is the Dodo Pizza company.  Besides the fact that they visualize everything that is possible, they still open this data to everyone.  What for?  This gives an even greater focus for the team, stimulates it, does not distract from the main thing. <br><br>  So that everyone could take advantage of this idea, we asked our <a href="https://www.canapecrm.ru/%3Futm_source%3Dhabrahabr-bell%26utm_medium%3Dpost%26utm_campaign%3Dbell">Canape CRM</a> division to develop a goal visualization tool and make it more accessible.  Try, ask. <br><br><h2>  To improve something, it must be considered </h2><br>  Our subscribers and customers know that we are all fans of counting.  But few people know that this particular habit was a key driver for us to get into the top 5 studios in the budget web development segment.  Of course, it is not necessary to count everything, but the key parameters that affect: a) profitability, b) quality, c) motivation - you need to read and control in real time.  This will allow you to constantly keep your finger on the pulse, not waiting for when everything that you feared happened to predict the implementation of the plans.  But, what is even more interesting, visualization allows you to create an automated system for moving the company to the goal. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/a05/c2b/cad/a05c2bcad5bb46abb4996fb7e17fda80.jpg" alt="Statistics on the work of managers in Canape CRM"><br>  <i>Statistics on the work of managers in Canape CRM</i> <br><br>  At one time, we added the ability to automatically control and limit the load of project managers in <a href="https://www.canapecrm.ru/%3Futm_source%3Dhabrahabr-bell%26utm_medium%3Dpost%26utm_campaign%3Dbell">Canape CRM</a> .  By several parameters, the system evaluates the current effectiveness of the manager in points, says how many new projects he can take on while remaining effective.  With a large flow of projects, when classic tools do not provide an opportunity to quickly control the situation, this gives the manager the opportunity to understand the potential of their resources.  On the other hand, managers are motivated for specific indicators that are important for the company at the moment for a quick movement to the goal. <br><br>  You need to understand that such a tool is applicable not only to web development.  Similarly, a significant part of businesses can be optimized where there is a thread of processes and standardization of work. <br><br><h2>  About the achievements of individuals should know everything </h2><br>  Sales are made one by one.  The sale of a neighbor is the sale of the whole team, everyone should know about it.  This life hacking we took from Maxim Batyrev in the book "45 manager tattoos."  Work in the supercompetitive market for sales and implementation of Consultant Plus forced him to use all possible incentive tools.  One of these was the ‚Äúsales bell‚Äù.  When the employee closed the deal, he approached the bell and rang it. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/e2a/ed2/f27/e2aed2f274284241bbe7ff25ce306cd7.jpg"><br>  <i>Alert for sale.</i>  <i>Photo - maznij.ru</i> <br><br>  We have slightly modified (digitized) this idea, turning the ringing of a bell into money rain.  Remember, like google, the first sales of contextual advertising sounded notes of money rain.  So in Canape CRM, when closing a deal, you can set up pleasant sounds to the soul :) <br><br>  The larger the transaction budget, the longer and louder the sound.  When an employee hears about the sale of a ‚Äúneighbor‚Äù, he does not want to fall behind and wants to contribute to the common cause, knowing that everyone is in the same boat, and if successful, everyone will receive their reward. <br><br>  Looking forward to hearing about your goals visualization experience.  Share screenshots, photos.  I am sure it will be interesting.  We wish you all the achievement of the most difficult and cherished goals! <br><br>  * cover photo from <a href="http://gallery.world/wallpaper/313281.html">gallery.world/wallpaper/313281.html</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/331476/">https://habr.com/ru/post/331476/</a></p>
