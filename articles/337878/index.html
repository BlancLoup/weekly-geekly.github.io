  <section class="page js-page"><h1>A few words about the inevitable turn in the development of the IT industry</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Due to the fact that a relatively large (and very loud) part of IT lives in the next bubble of dotcoms (now startups), some representatives of this tribe, and especially all evangelists and even HR, have the illusion of the following property. <br><br>  They say some kind of device, framework or way of working dramatically increases the success of the enterprise.  For example, "we all use the MacBook, and we have the third round of investment."  Or "we decided to open a travel-agency, and hire only those programmers who do not get out of travel;  we want all employees to share our values, and we already have a turnover of $ 100 million. "  Or "as soon as we implemented React + Vue + Angular, our business went uphill, and Google bought us."  And so on. <br><br>  At first glance it seems absurd?  - Yes, but we recognize: HYIP and hubbub are undoubted accompanying elements of the modern IT-world.  Any phenomenon that is at the forefront of public attention, and IT, of course, of these, cannot but absorb the characteristic features of the society of its time.  In particular, the tendency to the prevalence of form over content.

The market is literally going crazy to pour money at least someone who can give a short-term result.  Those who are lucky with a gravy from investors, can program at least standing on their heads: in order to achieve a quick result that needs to be presented to the speculative market, companies are not required, and sometimes even harmful, to build correct, well-adjusted business processes.  The path to the first success is visible, and the portfolio investor or a large IT giant, who for billions will acquire a fired start-up, will be seriously engaged in the business.  While everyone is waiting for the growth of stocks and another record in the indicator ‚Äúthe amount paid for the company / number of developers‚Äù, you can feel free to declare any of your whims.  There are no problems in human vagaries, but there is that only now they are trying to justify the success of the entire enterprise. <br><br>  Since the flow of easy money is still very strong, and the streams diverge around the industry, various hacks and explanations flock to the hot.  Entire volumes appear with pictures on the themes ‚Äúhow to work standing up cool,‚Äù ‚Äúhow to increase the conversion, if your chef is a penguin,‚Äù ‚Äúaikido tabulation,‚Äù and other nonsense.  Trainings of effective pair programming, trainings of effective autistic programming, seminars on Python on the new technology of training, seminars on training on the new version of Python, etc.  That is, people start poking around in secondary factors, which are almost always some funny, but insignificant features of an enterprise that has become successful due to, as a rule, the infusion of funds from serious uncles.  If it is even shorter, real market success (and failure) is always a <a href="https://sheglov.su/articles/148-teorija-vlasti/27987-povest-o-dvuh-vassalah">combination of big money, power and leadership ambitions</a> , and not the result of following some clever strategies that are usually written post-factum. <br><br>  Anyone who works at work for at least 10-15 years will probably remember, like he read in his time, books about ‚Äú100 secrets of success‚Äù, ‚Äú200 reasons to give up and do everything‚Äù and the like.  The only reliable result, which leads to following these Osterovsky tips, is that you dangle exactly in the middle.  No, there is always an example of Washi, who fired a shot, but single emissions of statistics never refuted the general population.  Therefore, the theory is not supported by practice, and therefore is nothing more than speculation. <br><br>  Parrying obvious objections, the author of this pamphlet undoubtedly shares the approach that a programmer learns one way or another throughout his career.  There are new languages, frameworks, approaches to work.  Nobody wants to make up tables like 15 years ago, and SPA is easier and more efficient to write on special frameworks, and not on the old native jQuery.  The development of tools is unstoppable, as is human progress in general. <br><br>  However, the essence of the new instrument of labor is rarely in direct proportion to the marketing factors that contribute to its introduction.  There is no direct connection between ‚Äúnew, stylish, cool‚Äù and ‚Äúeffective, reasonable, worthy‚Äù. <br><br>  Let us venture to pronounce very obvious considerations about the secrets of long-term success in the IT industry.  Sooner or later, when the bubble deflates, and the interest of global capital moves to a new industry (space, biology, medicine?), IT will have an inevitable conservative turn.  Suddenly it turns out that the lover of travel and coding from under the palm trees elementary works 20 hours a week instead of 30-40.  Suddenly it will turn out that from programming standing in 10 years varicose veins will develop (ask any hairdresser), and sitting on ottomans, curled over your favorite macbook, means considerable expenses for a neurologist and chiropractor in the future.  People will be surprised to find that Agile is not a panacea for all ills, and in general should be applied in a very limited range of tasks, and modern gamification is primarily a way of self-fulfillment for bored employees without real work.  It turns out that the beloved lecturer with glasses in horn-rimmed frames was an ordinary swindler and went off abroad with money collected through crowdfunding. <br><br>  There will be those companies that will earn on the product and its service, and not on the growth of the stock price or even just on the <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/company/madrobots/blog/232059/">promise of at least something to do</a> .  The unbridled need of community members to meet at meetings, conferences, hackathons and camps will disappear.  The progressive shaft of new silver bullets and ‚ÄúC ++ killers‚Äù will fall down.  Suddenly, it turns out that without a person who owns a serious, time-tested development toolkit, it is difficult to maintain the existing, already rich enough infrastructure of the industry.  It turns out that new approaches, solutions developed within the company, as a rule, have a greater real effect than fashionable solutions from the outside.  Under the pressure of circumstances (read, in connection with the reduction of budgets for experiments), a person who invented a solution to a specific problem himself will be valued more expensively than someone who could sell his management a solution from Google or Facebook, <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/company/infopulse/blog/330708/">just because</a> it is from Google or Facebook. <br><br>  Someone will say that <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/post/326904">will be boring</a> .  Perhaps someone new times seem bland.  Where the quality of the company's code does not depend on Friday pizza and table hockey in the office, as well as on the business trips of the best employees to the Valley, the fun funny guys have nothing to do.  The new heroes of the articles around the IT industry will be business engineers who are each digging for their own topic and are seeking for small, but fundamental improvements for everyone.  Society will be all the same, this or that hero has achieved success at the age of 19 or 50. The label on the case of the laptop and the ability to keep yourself in the presentations will become unimportant.  The advanced developers will stop calling each other "gurus" and will simply become engineers. <br><br>  <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/post/324426/">Strong IT professionals</a> who really have experience in solving a wide variety of tasks, perhaps, like workers in other industries, will ask their employers the right questions: what about processing, necessary insolation and proper nutrition in the office.  Perhaps the answer to <a href="https://www.bfm.ru/news/326702">ousting workers for homework</a> and other reductions in real benefits that they receive will be the creation of trade unions. <br><br>  The explosion of innovations and innovations will dialectically turn into its opposite, removing (in the Hegelian sense) all those real contradictions that have accumulated in the industry at the moment of rapid growth.  Perhaps the time will come to solve <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/post/278655/">long-standing issues</a> , because the next round of development of IT-technologies will really affect everyone: the Internet of things or cyber-terrorism will not leave the choice on the issue ‚Äúdo it quickly in the hope of future improvements‚Äù or ‚Äúdo it right away‚Äù ". </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/337878/">https://habr.com/ru/post/337878/</a></p>
