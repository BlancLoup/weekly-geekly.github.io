The program and reports was carried out enormous work, which we describe under the cut. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  The first thing you'll notice is an increase in scale.  Last time in St. Petersburg, we had only one day - now we turned around for two full days. <br><br>  The share of English speakers continues to grow.  There were five English-language reports in Moscow, and now there are already ten.  Among the English speakers there are famous people and creators of technology, for example:

    <ul><li>  <b>Simon Stewart</b> is the creator of WebDriver, the leader of the Selenium project.  Prior to that, he was head of the build tools team on Facebook - they were developing the Buck system.  Prior to that, he worked for five years at Google and three more at ThoughtWorks.  He knows a lot about unusual things, like mono-repositories and reproducible assemblies.  <a href="https://heisenbug-piter.ru/talks/2018/spb/6m4bimfd5kaw4o6cssam6k/">His report is</a> worth listening to, because this is a person who was directly at the origin of many tools that we use every day. </li><li>  <b>Michael Bolton</b> is a tester, consultant, and co-author of RST (instead of with James Bach).  About him we have a <a href="https://habr.com/company/jugru/blog/354810/">separate article</a> .  Rapid Software Testing is a methodology and mindset that allows you to test under pressure and time constraints.  Michael is the leader of the context-oriented testing movement, having more than twenty years of experience in testing, developing, managing software development.  He currently leads DevelopSense, a consulting company in Toronto.  He has <a href="https://heisenbug-piter.ru/talks/2018/spb/17io9aysrmw88cisuqq86a/">two</a> <a href="https://heisenbug-piter.ru/talks/2018/spb/7zgdkrdbk800wcwsggsa6a/">reports</a> at the conference, which are worth listening to because of the vast practical concentrated experience that he puts into each of his speeches. </li><li>  <b>Christian Stein</b> is an open source developer who has been developing in Java since 1996.  He is an expert in automated testing and in 2017 he joined the development of the JUnit 5 core. His <a href="https://heisenbug-piter.ru/talks/2018/spb/6xyulhpxpqqasqak2am2gs/">report</a> is about testing in the world of winning Java modules from a person who is well versed in this. </li><li>  <b>Adam Goucher</b> - better known as the man who resurrected Selenium IDE.  But this time, he <a href="https://heisenbug-piter.ru/talks/2018/spb/6praqgqjngkmmomkeaogeq/">came with a report</a> on how to test cloud applications - not only their main functionality, but also the things that make them cloud-based. </li></ul><br>  The list of cool speakers goes on and on. <br><br>  Secondly, we clarified the general set of topics, technologies and programming languages.  For example, earlier most of the reports used examples in the Java language, and this raised questions.  Now there will be both Python and Ruby, and even C ++. <br><br>  The dominant framework was Selenium (again, in Java).  This time Iv√°n L√≥pez reports <a href="https://heisenbug-piter.ru/talks/2018/spb/1mevbbt3keeaeekg0cmcys/">about Spock</a> and Artem Eroshenko <a href="https://heisenbug-piter.ru/talks/2018/spb/2zwqae0onmsiw0c8e6ooca/">about Allure</a> will be added.  Tired of JUnit?  Pay attention to other tools!  However, Selenium and JUnit from the program also did not disappear anywhere. <br><br>  Interestingly, the nature of discourse has changed recently, and participants want from the testing conference more and more hardcore reports and less and less traditional topics like load testing.  It seems that everyone has finally learned to do the workload and they want to go further. <br><br>  And we have something to offer!  There will be <a href="https://heisenbug-piter.ru/talks/2018/spb/6feubdtqqwqocya2w4cwq2/">‚ÄúTesting on the basis of Petri nets‚Äù by</a> Alexey Rodionov about the transition from conventional tests to model-based testing.  There will be a <a href="https://heisenbug-piter.ru/talks/2018/spb/3iv16unfmsgccuisuw0s4o/">report by Maxim Kazantsev</a> on finding functional problems in the compiler of the Java-machine Zing using the automatic test program generator.  Victor Yastrebov <a href="https://heisenbug-piter.ru/talks/2018/spb/6z6qugqh6gqwwuskiocsge/">will tell</a> about the legacy code auto-testing with examples in C ++. <br><br>  What about other topics?  In Moscow, there was no report about security, <a href="https://heisenbug-piter.ru/talks/2018/spb/chexr4uzvkiqciysaogyo/">and now there will be</a> .  There were no reports about the backend, but now they have appeared ( <a href="https://heisenbug-piter.ru/talks/2018/spb/1jny85xvcg2qqg0c66ccwq/">one</a> , <a href="https://heisenbug-piter.ru/talks/2018/spb/3pnf97jpummk4yeociqwi0/">two</a> ). <br><br>  Many reports on unusual topics: <br><br><ul><li>  Anastasia Semenyuk <a href="https://heisenbug-piter.ru/talks/2018/spb/beyolylrla4eq244mg4oi/">will talk</a> about Beta testing on VKontakte, testing large-scale updates and completely new products, developing a community of 12 thousand testers, processing tens of thousands of bug reports and so on. </li><li>  Olga Megorskaya will tell about <a href="https://heisenbug-piter.ru/talks/2018/spb/6vm8srckjooygusg6quem8/">crowdsourcing in Yandex</a> . </li><li>  Finally, the blockchain!  Evgeny Nychegovsky, using the example of the blockchain platform, Waves <a href="https://heisenbug-piter.ru/talks/2018/spb/5r06wm0ivok6cy4me2yciy/">will tell</a> about the problems of testing the blockchain and how to solve them. </li></ul><br>  In general, the conference has grown in size and as a report. <br><br>  The descriptions of individual reports are minimized under spoilers, and if you like, you can choose the most interesting among them and read them separately. <br><hr><h1>  The first day </h1><hr><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">The logic of verification</b> <div class="spoiler_text"><h1>  <a href="https://heisenbug-piter.ru/talks/2018/spb//17io9aysrmw88cisuqq86a">The logic of verification</a> </h1><br><p>  Software testing is sometimes described as ‚Äúchecking and validation‚Äù ‚Äîaccording to Wikipedia.

It should be borne in mind that the search and correction of causes should be carried out as accurately as possible.

A year and a half ago, we learned from the developer HtmlElements about the existence of a new version.  Then we began to develop the project together and created a new framework for working with PageObject - Atlas (Application Test Layout). </p><br><p>  In the report we will tell you how the first HtmlElements did not satisfy us and why we abandoned the existing solutions in favor of ours.  We will show what kind of functionality lies at the core of Atlas, how our old projects have changed with it, what extension points there are and how to use them for ourselves. </p><br><p>  The report will be useful to both old users of HtmlElements, and new people who are in search of a framework for testing. </p><br><br clear="all"><br clear="all"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/fc9/aff/c04/fc9affc04f921665ae5bc0c07b9b256f.jpg" width="200" align="left">  <b>Yuri Kalinin</b> / Yandex <br><br><p>  More than six years in testing.
