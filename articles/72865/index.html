  <section class="page js-page"><h1>TeamWox enterprise management system becomes cheaper!</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  That came on October 20th.  It was on this day that in different years, American rapper Snoop Dogg, our football player Alenichev and actor Bela Lugosi, known for his role as Dracula, were born.  On the same day, the first edition of Sportloto, the sudden visit of Khrushchev to Poland, and the Netherlands banned the sale of marijuana to foreign tourists. <br><br>  We, <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/metaquotes/blog/71833/">as promised earlier</a> , begin a three-level sale of the <a href="http://www.teamwox.com/ru">TeamWox system</a> .  If before, there was a single price on TeamWox, now the client has a choice.  The cost of the system from today will depend on the size of the client‚Äôs business.  The fewer people working in the company, the less it will pay for TeamWox.  This logic is beneficial for small companies and is valid for large ones. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="http://i.teamwox.com/public/habr/teamwox_prices.jpg" title="TeamWox has become more accessible!" alt="TeamWox  !" width="444" height="306"></div>

    <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  Celebrities at the very beginning are mentioned for good reason.  After all, they all managed to congratulate us on a new pricing policy.  Snoop Dogg sang the song ‚ÄúGroove On‚Äù with the Russian boy Timati for the first time, where he outlined the business response to the price reduction of TeamWox:  Dmitry Alenichev, certainly possessing the gift of the visionary, knocked the ball in advance in the Champions League final back in 2004.  Bela Lugosi allowed to use his image in our campaign ‚ÄúTeamWox does not require implementation‚Äù: <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="http://i.teamwox.com/public/habr/no_implementation.gif" title="TeamWox does not require deployment" alt="TeamWox   " width="300" height="335"></div><br><br>  The new sales scheme means that companies will be able to buy TeamWox at more affordable prices without overpaying for ‚Äúextra‚Äù users. <br><br>  Recall that a <a href="http://www.teamwox.com/ru/teamwox/tutorials/37">version of up to 10 users is provided to the business for free</a> .  The price of the version up to 25 users is 100 thousand rubles.  Up to 50 - 200 thousand rubles.  A version with an unlimited number of users costs 300 thousand rubles. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="http://i.teamwox.com/public/habr/teamwox_price_ru.gif" title="New prices for TeamWox" alt="   TeamWox" width="771" height="163"></div><br><br>  The annual subscription to technical support and system updates is 20% of the license price.  Licenses for up to 10 users receive all system updates and limited technical support free of charge. <br><br>  The purchase price includes one year subscription, during which customers will receive technical support and updates.  Having bought any commercial version of TeamWox, the client will be able to contact the technical support of the development company and receive all updates within a year.  In the future, you can not pay an annual subscription, while continuing to work in the system without any restrictions.  This is just an additional option that the customer can opt out of.  However, in this case, the client will be able to receive only limited technical support through a public forum, system updates will not be available to him. <br><br>  All this means only one thing: small businesses have a great opportunity to automate and optimize their processes for reasonable money.  TeamWox is not Sportloto, because everyone is the winner.  This is not a joke, but a clear victory.  Yes, and the Dutch with their ban would remain today in the cold.  After all, the endorphins secreted when using TeamWox in the company are stronger than any drug, and you can buy the system from anywhere in the world.  Political leader Khrushchev, if he lived in our time, he would have definitely switched his attention from corn to TeamWox.  And the slogan "Catch up with and overtake America" ‚Äã‚Äãwould apply ... well, you understand what. <br><br>  In short, October 20 came.  Groove on! <br><br><h2>  About the system </h2><br><br>  TeamWox groupware system is designed to optimize management in the company.  With its help, you can optimize production processes, make them more transparent, speed up decision-making based on complete and reliable information. <br><br>  In addition, TeamWox stores all information on clients and the history of relationships with them, various internal documents, tasks and discussions.
