We went there as participants (exhibitor) - our company presented <a href="http://www.webasyst.ru/">web services WebAsyst</a> at the exhibition.  A small report on the impressions. <br><br><img src="http://webasyst.webasyst.net/PD/html/scripts/getfilethumb.php?nocache=1191333798&amp;basefile=JTJGaG9tZSUyRmNsdXN0ZXIlMkZob21lJTJGc2l0ZXMlMkZ3YSUyRmRhdGElMkZXRUJBU1lTVCUyRmF0dGFjaG1lbnRzJTJGcGQlMkZmaWxlcyUyRjglMkZEU0NfMDU5NS4xMDI0LmpwZw==&amp;ext=SlBH&amp;SIZE=512" alt="Web 2.0 EXPO"><br><br>  The exhibition was held from 5th to 8th January 2007 in Messe Berlin. <br>  Two exhibitions took place in one hall at once - Web 2.0 Expo and <a href="http://berlin.interop.com/">Interop</a> .  Although initially it was not planned - we (as exhibitors) were informed that the two exhibitions would be merged about a month and a half before the event.  The reason why they decided to merge was not indicated, but it was easy to understand that both exhibitions simply didn‚Äôt get as many participants and visitors as planned. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  In fact, the event began on November 5th with a speech by Tim O'Reilly, the person who coined the term Web 2.0.  The speech is of a rather general nature - he spoke about how important it is to make a user-oriented system, how much useful data can be extracted from user behavior (for example, a mobile phone cited - how much mobile providers could extract information from who I call, how many and SMS sending, etc.).  He called Google a company that correctly aggregates data :) He said that he sees a great future in the development of devices with touch controls (for example, iPhone).  And much more.  Personally, I liked the performance. <br>  See a <a href="http://youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3DB1nlhCPfJNI">fragment of the speech</a> .

      At lectures and various keynote'ah was not (all the days we spent at our booth in the exhibition hall), so I can not say anything about them.  But the opinions of other people about this part of the exhibition were not entirely flattering.  First of all, because <a href="http://berlin.web2expo.com/registration/pricing-packages.php">it was expensive</a> (1300 euros for a full conference pass!).  But this price included sandwiches and coffee in the buffet, so the most dissatisfied "beat off" the money spent there :) <br><br>  Companies <a href="http://berlin.web20expo.com/">exhibiting at the exhibition</a> hall were few - Amazon Web Services, G.ho.st, Zoho, Adobe, Nokia, Sun, Jive Software (a full list of companies is <a href="http://berlin.web20expo.com/">on the exhibition website</a> ) + Interop stands (Microsoft, Cisco, HP, etc. ).  A lot of space, which, apparently, was planned to hang out to exhibitors, was occupied by the organizers themselves - apparently, so that the exhibition itself did not seem empty. <br>  Moreover, some companies are not at all aware of how they are related to web 2.0.  Nokia, for example, simply showed its devices and how they looked at various popular resources like flickr, facebook, etc. <br>  The people in the espo hall had the most on the first day.  On the last day of the exhibition (November 8th), practically no one was there ... the exhibitors had to be bored at the stands. <br><br>  It was interesting to talk with different people, to meet with competitors and like-minded people personally.  It was the most interesting and useful in the whole event. <br><br>  By the way, it was interesting to meet Russian-speaking visitors to the exhibition, even though there were not many of them.  Unfortunately, there were no other exhibition booths from Russia. <br><br>  See a small <a href="http://webasyst.webasyst.net/photos/web2expoberlin">photo report from the exhibition</a> . </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/16182/">https://habr.com/ru/post/16182/</a></p>
