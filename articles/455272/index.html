For some time I am your reader and today decided that the time has come for my first post here. <br><br>  I have long wanted to learn how to program and spent the last couple of months all my free time, watching tutorials on youtube, reading answers and comments on stackoverflow, as well as studying other resources for novice developers, including Habr.  In order for all knowledge to be applied in practice, I decided that a full-fledged project should be done. <br><br>  The idea came to me when I began to spend a lot of time behind the wheel: I went to work and home, worked as a courier at a pizzeria and rode the countryside on weekends.  At one point, I was bored with these looped few songs on popular radio stations, and I switched to audio books.  But even this did not last long enough, as I sometimes forgot what was described there earlier and had to be listened to.  Then I thought that it would be nice to listen to some interesting articles and stories from popular resources on the net, such as Habr, vc, spark, meduza and many others. <br><a name="habracut"></a>

This is a small free portal where every author can voice his post or article and share the track with everyone else.  For some, this will be another excellent channel of communication with users, and for others - a convenient way to get interesting information, moreover, voiced by the author himself. <br><br>  You can say that this is very similar to the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãpodcasts, but this is not quite true.  On TheOutloud you will not need professional equipment to record audio, you will not need additional sound effects or musical accompaniment of the text, moreover, you will not need to maintain your channel and download tracks with a certain regularity. <br><br>  After you write your post or article, use a voice recorder on your phone or a regular microphone on your computer for voice acting.  Modern programs for recording sound cope with their task well enough, provided that you are in a quiet place, and not somewhere on the street.  However, there are some great applications for recording voices away from home. <br><br>  And so, having voiced your article and received an mp3 file, you simply upload it to the site in the necessary section, which is only six now.  You can add a link to a text article on any resource to the track so that those who want to read it more closely can easily do it. <br><br>  For ordinary listeners, I also tried to make some convenient functions.  For example, in addition to moving from the track to a link to a text article, the user can save the track for listening later, and also subscribe to the author to track his new audio. <br><br>  If on other resources, users can like or ‚Äúadd‚Äù articles, then on TheOutloud I implemented the function of assessing the voice of the author.  On a 10-point scale, you will be able to rate the record and thereby increase its rating.  A little later on the portal you can find the most popular articles and authors with the best voice acting. <br><br>  You can also enable autoplay of all articles on the portal in turn, or switch to playlists: from the author or from the section.  In other words, you can listen to all the articles of only your favorite author, or from the section on, say, psychology. <br><br>  As I said, the site is completely free.  Authors can download as many articles as they want, as well as listeners - to get acquainted with the tracks without restrictions, including in the background. <br><br>  I would appreciate your comments and feedback.  This is my first completely independent portal written in php, js, ajax and jquery.  Do not scold for code or function execution.  I am a beginner in this business and I will gradually study further. <br><br>  I would be glad if you rate my project and give feedback - <a href="http://theoutloud.ru/">theoutloud.ru</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/455272/">https://habr.com/ru/post/455272/</a></p>
