  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Top 10: best reports DotNext 2017 Moscow</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"><p>  Hi, Habr!  In April, we officially made public the best videos from DotNext 2017 Moscow.  The result was a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist%3Flist%3DPLtWrKx3nUGBfpyGWy9Qo8kd7r0sPiMFOF">playlist of 25 reports</a> .  Just remind here about this magical playlist. </p><br><p>  I am now watching the most interesting videos and invite to join!  To make it easier to join the review of the conference records, under the cut you are waiting for short notes on the ten reports that received the highest marks from visitors to the past DotNext.  If out of 25 pieces you feel able to see only a few reports, feel free to choose from this list. </p><br><p>  Formally, the lower the list, the higher the rating.  But there is an important clarification: all the reports from the top ten have a very, very high rating, and their exact position strongly depends on the nuances of counting.  For example, if you use soft quorum, then Andrey Okinshin's keynote about performance testing will overtake Sasha Goldstein's report on debugging and profiling on Linux.  In other words, see everything :-) </p><br><p>  Under the cut there will be a table of contents for easy navigation through the contents of the post. </p><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/ma/an/l5/maanl5218ybvmw1d8pruqkqmiqw.jpeg"><a name="habracut"></a><br><br><h1 id="oglavlenie">  Table of contents </h1><br><ul><li>  <a href="https://habr.com/company/jugru/blog/417265/">Final keyout: Unchain my heart</a> </li><li>  <a href="https://habr.com/company/jugru/blog/417265/">ASP.NET Core: Attack Prevention Mechanisms 2.0</a> </li><li>  <a href="https://habr.com/company/jugru/blog/417265/">Patterns for high-performance C #: from algorithm to low-level techniques</a> </li><li>  <a href="https://habr.com/company/jugru/blog/417265/">NUKE: Build automation for C # developers</a> </li><li>  <a href="https://habr.com/company/jugru/blog/417265/">Artificial Intelligence and Neural Networks for .NET Developers</a> </li><li>  <a href="https://habr.com/company/jugru/blog/417265/">Akka Streams for mere mortals</a> </li><li>  <a href="https://habr.com/company/jugru/blog/417265/">The Metrix has you ...</a> </li><li>  <a href="https://habr.com/company/jugru/blog/417265/">Life, liberty and the pursuit of APIness: the secret to happy code</a> </li><li>  <a href="https://habr.com/company/jugru/blog/417265/">Keynout: Let's talk about performance testing</a> </li><li>  <a href="https://habr.com/company/jugru/blog/417265/">Debugging and Profiling .NET Core Apps on Linux</a> </li></ul><br><a name="10"></a><br><h2 id="zavershayuschiy-keynout-unchain-my-hearthttp2017dotnext-moscowru2017msktalkskjv46xmfskuq4eaaggyew">  <a href="http://2017.dotnext-moscow.ru/2017/msk/talks/kjv46xmfskuq4eaaggyew/">Final keyout: Unchain my heart</a> </h2><br><p>  <em>Dino Esposito, JetBrains</em> </p><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/WtmM-xR7Z00" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><p>  When giving a task to a person, it is necessary to check that he does not just remember your words, but also understands what to do next.  What did you learn from our conversation?  What are the first steps?  Simple, effective questions. </p><br><p>  This Dino story is not a standard report, but a closing keyout.  Just as the goal of the opening keyout is to set the direction of the conference, the final keyout sets the future life of the participant.  What did you make of the conference?  How does this affect your life? </p><br><p>  In this report, Dino moves us 30 years ahead with a time machine and adds another level of depth to these standard questions.  Returning from the future, how will we relate to the present? </p><br><p><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/o1/de/nk/o1denkhogptvhmokxsjb57h9yog.png"></p><br><p>  Dino tells a big - for forty minutes - and a very reasonable forecast for the coming years.  Both the blockchain, and bigdata, and even the digital soul fall into it.  Will robots conquer us?  Spoiler: in the end everyone will die!  (Yes, there is a real game going on). </p><br><p>  But here I would like to argue.  I like very much the recent discussion on Reddit: ‚ÄúHow do you capture the world if you find yourself in 1990 with all the current memories, but in the body of the child you once were?‚Äù Vladimir Guriev, a short one of the answers, <a href="https://www.facebook.com/vguriev/posts/10155911933603305">recently</a> translated which previously gave us <a href="https://2k.livejournal.com/520078.html">a modern marketing textbook</a> ), but it is better <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/8xamvz/your_life_resets_to_1990_and_you_have_all_of_your/e22e55e/">to read the original</a> .  We, as engineers and people who have dedicated themselves to improving the world by creating some technical wonders, easily believe in a man of the future who, with sticks and ropes (the same as today, but a little better) can make a nuclear starship.  But if you return to reality, then ordinary stupid people (such as me, for example), do much more boring and nasty things. </p><br><p>  I advise you to look at keynoout Dino and independently decide on this.  Perhaps write your story in the comments on Habr√©?  What are we worse than Reddit? </p><br><a name="9"></a><br><h2 id="aspnet-core-mehanizmy-predotvrascheniya-atak-20http2017dotnext-moscowru2017msktalks56xfqlt2aq44wauewm0u2q">  <a href="http://2017.dotnext-moscow.ru/2017/msk/talks/56xfqlt2aq44wauewm0u2q/">ASP.NET Core: Attack Prevention Mechanisms 2.0</a> </h2><br><p>  <em>Mikhail Scherbakov</em> </p><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/YAedU19N59w" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><p>  The new part of the report of Michael about the following types of defense: </p><br><ul><li>  Open Redirect protection; </li><li>  Data Protection; </li><li>  XSS protection; </li><li>  CSP setup; </li><li>  Anti-Request Forgery; </li><li>  CORS setup; </li><li>  Use of cookies. </li></ul><br><p>  The report was a result of the participation of Michael in the indefinite Microsoft Bug Bounty Program.  The first bug he found was just in protection against Open Redirect, which is shown at the beginning of the report in just a minute. </p><br><p>  To understand the topic in other parts of the report, we are told about changes to the Data Protection API, after which we immerse ourselves in work with security and holes in it for forty minutes.  Understands how the built-in XSS and CSRF protection mechanisms work, what cryptography features are available out of the box, how session management is organized, and so on. </p><br><p>  I myself am interested in this topic and often watch security reports on YouTube.  The worst thing that awaits you as a spectator: two hours of nudyatiny, 90% consisting of the banalities of the form "if you are stupid, then everything is very bad", at the end of which you find yourself sleeping with a nose in the keyboard.  Misha's report compares favorably with the fact that there is no time to sleep on it: clearly delineated thoughts, real examples of code to illustrate them, if some concepts are introduced - slides with wordings and links to extended materials. </p><br><p>  Such reports should be viewed immediately, as I learned to write my first controller, just to not rewrite a lot of code in vain. </p><br><p>  By the way, in February we published a transcript of the report of Michael on Habr√©.  If you do not have time to watch, you can always <a href="https://habr.com/company/jugru/blog/350188/">read</a> . </p><br><a name="8"></a><br><h2 id="patterns-for-high-performance-c-from-algorithm-optimization-to-low-level-techniqueshttp2017dotnext-moscowru2017msktalks3dzbwqxenm6eqkai4giygw">  <a href="http://2017.dotnext-moscow.ru/2017/msk/talks/3dzbwqxenm6eqkai4giygw/">Patterns for high-performance C #: from algorithm to low-level techniques</a> </h2><br><p>  <em>Federico Lois, Corvalius</em> </p><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/7GTpwgsmHgU" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><p>  The brutal story of how to treat C # so cruelly that it becomes different from itself - but it starts to work very quickly and well. </p><br><p>  For the sake of justice, about every second thread on the performance on Habr√© or every first discussion for a beer can pretend to this. </p><br><p>  We after all quite often write reviews of something on Habr and for a long time already understood the essence of the concept "hardcore" for the Russian developer.  Hardcore and performance are twins.  We talk about performance - we mean hardcore, we talk about hardcore - we mean performance. </p><br><p>  Federico developed his own scale: </p><br><p><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/6o/18/cj/6o18cjqxu1bqxjbjydfjcmguv10.png"></p><br><p>  This is a talk about performance, everything as you like.  And very cynical and intelligible.  It‚Äôs not very easy to argue with the speaker, given that he is one of the developers of RavenDB, and she‚Äôs all about speed.  There will be unpleasant things about the fact that you cannot use try-catch and LINQ, it will be about inling, about Pareto's law (turned into a checklist) - anything, just to deceive the system and achieve significant acceleration. </p><br><p>  All this reminds me of this video: </p><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/df7HymzZBao" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><p>  <strong>Operator</strong> : Wait a second, let me take off the height.  Well nafig!  Here on this roof you jump. <br>  <strong>Tracer</strong> : Ready? <br>  <strong>Operator</strong> : Yes. <br>  <strong>Tracer</strong> : <em>silently runs, jumps, silently punches the roof of the building and with an ax goes into the depths</em> </p><br><p>  The need to use such cheating to speed up the code now seems to me to be such a ‚Äúleap of faith‚Äù.  But if one day you have to jump, it is better to see this report than not to watch (and if you are too lazy to watch, then read our <a href="https://habr.com/company/jugru/blog/352362/">translation</a> ). </p><br><a name="7"></a><br><h2 id="nuke-build-automation-for-c-developershttp2017dotnext-moscowru2017msktalks3kegqjhxtyyo4g28wmwo6c">  <a href="http://2017.dotnext-moscow.ru/2017/msk/talks/3kegqjhxtyyo4g28wmwo6c/">NUKE: Build automation for C # developers</a> </h2><br><p>  <em>Matthias Koch, JetBrains</em> </p><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/7gEqxzD6hbs" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><p>  <a href="https://nuke.build/">NUKE</a> is one of the projects Mathias is working on.  This is such an assembly automation system where everything can be described on C # DSL. </p><br><p>  C # here, despite the fact that it allows you to describe the assembly in the familiar infrastructure, in the IDE, with a decent auto-completion, and not suffer with clicking on the buttons in Jenkins or, for example, cram conditions as strings in MSBuild.  Almost one fifth of the report is devoted to a discussion of the applicability of jenkins and mbsilds. </p><br><p>  Very cool that this video appeared in the public domain.  The fact is that I have a long personal history of dislike for Jenkins, and each new person needs to re-explain the same balalaika about the causes and conclusions.  Now it‚Äôs enough to give a link to this video. </p><br><p>  As for the main part of the report, this is a bunch of practical material on what Nuke is and how to live with it.  Now <a href="https://github.com/nuke-build/nuke">they have</a> more than seven hundred commits and more than a dozen contributors <a href="https://github.com/nuke-build/nuke">on a githaba</a> , so probably this can already be used.  A report from the creator of the technology can best help in mastering. </p><br><a name="6"></a><br><h2 id="iskusstvennyy-intellekt-i-neyroseti-dlya-net-razrabotchikovhttp2017dotnext-moscowru2017msktalks3emvrfszfcuieigqe0cimq">  <a href="http://2017.dotnext-moscow.ru/2017/msk/talks/3emvrfszfcuieigqe0cimq/">Artificial Intelligence and Neural Networks for .NET Developers</a> </h2><br><p>  <em>Dmitry Soshnikov, Microsoft</em> </p><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/E4mP1slv4oI" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><p>  A very cool report that lays the foundations for programming neural networks in C # for those who have not yet been able to, but really want to. </p><br><p>  I had a situation where you need to quickly pick up image recognition.  I took up the popular courses on neural networks and found that they didn‚Äôt respond to my request, but rather were engaged in general education.  As a result, friends wrote the signer :-) And this report by Dmitriy is a balm for the soul, because it answers all the actual requests of an ordinary person, after which it‚Äôs clear what to read and what to understand. </p><br><p> Initially, there is a small introduction on what Microsoft does and what neural network technologies they have.  Dmitry clearly said that he had reduced the number of Microsoft marketing slides to a minimum, although it is here that I don‚Äôt understand this marketing heyte - anyway, we‚Äôll use these technologies, we‚Äôll look for them.  As if there is some choice. </p><br><p>  Further briefly indicates how Satanists live data in their Jupyter Notebook and that you can not install it, and get in the cloud.  Tellingly, Jupyter Notebook from Dmitriy started right at the time of live coding - in my opinion, the best demonstration of why C # is needed, and it‚Äôs impossible to think up. </p><br><p>  A significant part of the report is a story about whether it is difficult to write all this yourself.  Examples are shown based on the recognition of numbers in the pictures. </p><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/o0/y7/6h/o0y76hattk19w8qpbs8k5whduw8.png"><br><p>  At first, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K-nearest_neighbors_algorithm">k-nearest neighbors are</a> written with handles on the cycles, which is accurate (94%), but wildly slow - not a single k-NN demo has worked to the end of the report.  Then the same k-NN is encoded on Accord.NET, and it works a little faster, but not really, because the algorithm is the same.  But the feature of Accord.NET is that it is already a decent looking code, and you can quickly replace the classifier with some other one.  Dmitry set up a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Support_vector_machine">support vector machine</a> , and everything accelerated sharply (the set of 5 thousand pictures began to run in seconds, the accuracy almost did not fall - 92%). </p><br><p>  But you can still do steeper and drag neural networks.  In the Accord.NET SVM demo, it was replaced with a neural network, almost without changing the code.  But this is not necessary, because there are other, more cool and fast frameworks.  Dmitry said a few words about TensorFlow and the rest of the report spoke about the Microsoft Cognitive Toolkit (formerly known as CNTK).  After reviewing many demos, we saw that the result is ultra-accurate networks (98%) with complex, but, nevertheless, quite understandable code. </p><br><p>  Having seen this report, now I can‚Äôt just fall asleep just like that.  All these things are written in clear code, and they seem to have a clear mathematical basis that a student can understand, but as a result they work wonders.  Distinguishing a photo of a cat from a photo of a dog is a miracle, you will never think of an algorithm for this, and the neural net somehow does it right before your eyes. </p><br><p>  What if my brain is just an apparatus that approximates a function?  And the whole life is just one more multiplication of matrices with a small non-linear part, which can be written with a relatively small piece of code ... How to live with it now? </p><br><p>  ( <a href="https://habr.com/company/jugru/blog/352138/">the link</a> is available to decipher the report) </p><br><a name="5"></a><br><h2 id="akka-streams-dlya-prostyh-smertnyhhttp2017dotnext-moscowru2017msktalks3n90v5rogcu2cyq4s4awuc">  <a href="http://2017.dotnext-moscow.ru/2017/msk/talks/3n90v5rogcu2cyq4s4awuc/">Akka Streams for mere mortals</a> </h2><br><p>  <em>Vagif Abilov, Miles</em> </p><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ibpnza_PCr0" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><p>  This is a concept report about life in the world of streams.  There are examples of this kind: </p><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/ou/dg/ur/oudgurncbss5wyryuyyxjk1h1ok.png"><br><p>  They show a gradually becoming more complex quite specific code, details are discussed.  Still, the main thing is the general idea of ‚Äã‚Äãthe question. </p><br><p>  For people who are not immersed in the topic, it may seem that to understand Akka Streams you need to understand Akka perfectly and understand reactively well.  Vagif argues that this is not entirely true, which removes the load from the soul and lowers the threshold for entering the topic. </p><br><p>  For me personally, the whole topic of streams seemed (and it seems so far, it‚Äôs impossible to believe reports without trying) rather creepy, just because it is directly related to the topic of functional transformations and data management outside the usual thread-lock model.  Yes, managing threads and building constructions from old school frameworks for them is a vile thing, but understandable and hackneyed over the years. </p><br><p>  Vagif explains for the transition to actors, <a href="https://tech.kinja.com/5-myths-about-actors-1190754834">reveals the theme that actors are not assembled</a> (more precisely, they are assembled in the sense in which human society is assembled), and from this moves to Reactive Streams as a means to raise the level of abstraction and expression even more. </p><br><p>  There is a set of interfaces on the Reactive Streams stack (Publisher, Subscriber, Subscription, Processor), but no one expects us to manually resolve these interfaces.  There are library developers who will do it for us - for example, this is done in Akka Streams. </p><br><p>  For me, it was a discovery that dynamic push / pull in Reactive Streams is out of the box, and it doesn‚Äôt hurt at all - or rather, it‚Äôs not so painful when you try to code backpressure yourself. </p><br><p>  Moreover, the author does not strike at some kind of fanaticism and does not forget about alternatives (RX, TPL DataFlow, Orleans Streams), talks about the pros and cons.  The absence of fanaticism is a huge bonus in comparison with the typical story of a reactive lover who has become attached to one particular library. </p><br><p>  In general, I understood the idea this way: when we use microservices and other multicomponent architectures, there is no forest behind the trees, and streaming is such a way to rise to a higher level and get an idea of ‚Äã‚Äãthe overall process.  To go on such rails, you need to take Akka Streams, and everything will be in chocolate. </p><br><p>  Want to motivate yourself to go on streaming?  Must watch. </p><br><a name="4"></a><br><h2 id="the-metrix-has-youhttp2017dotnext-moscowru2017msktalks2wij6mss4oea0mqi2g0ewk">  <a href="http://2017.dotnext-moscow.ru/2017/msk/talks/2wij6mss4oea0mqi2g0ewk/">The Metrix has you ...</a> </h2><br><p>  <em>Anatoly Kulakov, Paladyne Systems</em> </p><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/AFB89L8DLpE" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><p>  Many developers do not like to think about the terrible things that users do with their applications.  Often, when the colleagues asked the question ‚Äúhow to view the metrics,‚Äù they would say a fierce game about ‚Äúbog logs‚Äù, ‚Äúlook in MySQL‚Äù and so on, and it was not easy to persuade them to think about the question. </p><br><p>  This report of Anatoly is just such a moment of enlightenment.  It begins with an explanation of the differences between monitoring and logging, with a detailed statement of motivation.  Further, our supposed amateur lover is immersed in concrete examples of what needs to be done. </p><br><p>  We'll have to do the Time Series (about which the theoretical minimum is told - why we are needed, what are the advantages, what the essence of the optimizations are) using the example of the well-known InfluxDB database (about which the specifics, possibilities and disadvantages are analyzed).  And so on and so forth.  A lot of good content, including live demos with experiments on a local Grafana and an archiver application, whose performance data is collected via BenchmarkDotNet. </p><br><p>  If you don‚Äôt care about reading-writing time, if you don‚Äôt run into throughput, if you don‚Äôt know what downsampling is, if you don‚Äôt need specialized statistics and aggregation functions, if you want to delete all data on one line with your hands, if you don‚Äôt rest data and know for sure that you will never have high loads - you can continue to save metrics data in the RDBMS, log logs and live happily.  All others need to use modern tools and watch this report (or <a href="https://habr.com/company/jugru/blog/352624/">read the</a> transcript). </p><br><a name="3"></a><br><h2 id="life-liberty-and-the-pursuit-of-apiness-the-secret-to-happy-codehttp2017dotnext-moscowru2017msktalks4ptxeq6flmeeqekygw4iws">  <a href="http://2017.dotnext-moscow.ru/2017/msk/talks/4ptxeq6flmeeqekygw4iws/">Life, liberty and the pursuit of APIness: the secret to happy code</a> </h2><br><p>  <em>Dylan Beattie, Spotlight</em> </p><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/gJW7XqVx-qE" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><p>  Dylan Beattie is a person with so many work achievements and interesting projects that it is easier to read the full list <a href="http://2017.dotnext-moscow.ru/2017/msk/talks/4ptxeq6flmeeqekygw4iws/">on our website</a> .  In the context of the report, it is interesting that Dylan is a system architect who right now is working on building complex modern distributed applications, and, accordingly, on developing the right APIs for them.  Well and, of course, absolutely everyone who visited DotNext parties knows him. </p><br><p>  Whether we are aware or not, every time we create new programs, we also create user experience.  People will interact with our code - as end users or maybe as members of the development team.  Or maybe they are mobile application developers using your API, or is it someone who needs to go to the night to fix the problems that have arisen.  From the outside, this may seem like quite different cases, but in fact they have something in common.  Dylan calls this the word " <em>discoverability</em> ." </p><br><p>  This is where this very philosophical and at the same time purely practical report came from.  First, Dylan gives a detailed introduction to the psychology of learning and various learning models.  What do you think, which of the learning curves is better? </p><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/j-/wp/bu/j-wpbumdxpg4f0r6skr-ult4lb4.png"><br><p>  Next comes the story of how <em>discoverability</em> manifests itself for the end users of the system, and then - most importantly - how it all relates to the code, data, API and other things that make up the life of a programmer.  Step by step, at all levels of the application. </p><br><p>  Do not believe that autocompletion, hypermedia or fluent API make life better?  What about beautiful dashboards, understandable metrics or, for example, logging levels that are named not by threat, but by meaning?  Maybe you understand all this, but you do not know how to tell your colleagues about this so that they finally start using all this?  Then you urgently need to watch this report (by the way, in the spring we have already published a <a href="https://habr.com/company/jugru/blog/351144/">translation</a> on Habr√©). </p><br><a name="2"></a><br><h2 id="keynout-pogovorim-pro-performance-testirovaniehttp2017dotnext-moscowru2017msktalks6a4afxs2sqmwws0yuoc06s">  Keynout: <a href="http://2017.dotnext-moscow.ru/2017/msk/talks/6a4afxs2sqmwws0yuoc06s/">Let's talk about performance testing</a> </h2><br><p>  <em>Andrey Akinshin, JetBrains</em> </p><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/LEy3_2ZzWpk" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><p>  Andrei had a very difficult task: to tell about the performance, but at the same time - in the format of the opening keyout.  As you probably know, keyout has several goals, the main one of which is to convey the spirit and essence of what will happen at the conference.  From this it follows that such a report should understand more or less everything.  On the other hand, performance is the second name of hardcore, that is, the topic is complex and specific. </p><br><p>  No wonder Andrei constantly receives his highest ratings, he got out.  It is clear that most companies now do not test performance in any way, or they are already testing it on living people in sales.  There is no coherent theory of solving this kind of problems, so it‚Äôs not necessary to tell a gear-crushing materiel.  Need some basic understanding of the topic. </p><br><p>  The report is devoted to 13 notes on performance.  I will not tell all thirteen, for why produce spoilers.  For example, the first article is devoted to sources of performance data.  Or, for example, if you have a list of performance anomalies, then removing the small problems that Andrei talks about will simplify the analysis of performance problems (problems that you haven‚Äôt yet written but will write soon).  One of these options, which is devoted to ‚Äúnote 6‚Äù - clustering on the example of operating systems. </p><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/j8/uu/qg/j8uuqgevmk-xqjslnfvohclzhza.png"><br><p>  Performance testing is interesting, but difficult.  Moreover, performance testing can and should be done.  IMHO, the report is unique in that a bunch of things are revealed here that people would like to do, but either don‚Äôt do, or lie, what they do.  Therefore, see the report by Andrey, collect performance-purity and performance-culture, and then your products will be super-fast, responsive, smooth and silky. </p><br><a name="1"></a><br><h2 id="debugging-and-profiling-net-core-apps-on-linuxhttp2017dotnext-moscowru2017msktalks2dfoltply8kscqeoa6444g">  <a href="http://2017.dotnext-moscow.ru/2017/msk/talks/2dfoltply8kscqeoa6444g/">Debugging and Profiling .NET Core Apps on Linux</a> </h2><br><p>  <em>Sasha Goldshtein, Sela Group</em> </p><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/O4kTJW91Ri4" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><p>  Sasha is an outstanding performance engineer, and there is nothing surprising that he got to the very top of the rating.  Another reason for the victory: it has become very fashionable to add ‚Äú.NET Core‚Äù to the title of the report just for the sake of hyip.  There are not so many stories about something where .NET Core plays a meaningful role, and this report is one of them.  Or here's another idea: this is a purely practical report on the use of free tools that immediately go along with the operating system and runtime, and all this is quite convenient and works with low overhead - it would be a shame not to figure it out. </p><br><p> Imagine having managed to run your favorite ASP.NET application on Linux or even something with a console interface.  What's next?  A happy ending?  Oh no.  In fact, you will have to encounter memory leaks, strange crashes, performance problems, and many other troubles - and what to do when all this happens in production?  On Windows, we have a bunch of interesting tools, but they won't work in Linux, and there are no simple alternatives yet.  In this report, Sasha explains how debugging and profiling of .NET Core applications on Linux now looks like.  How to investigate using <code>perf</code> , how <code>LTTNG</code> used as a replacement for <code>ETW</code> events, how to compile and understand LTTNG <code>LTTNG</code> and more.  Sasha will talk about collecting <em>core dumps</em> and how to get information interesting for the .NET developer using <code>lldb</code> and <code>SOS</code> . </p><br><p>  In short, everyone who decides to watch the video will go on an uneasy detective journey through the jungle of unfinished utilities and special command line magic.  With a happy ending (but this is not certain). </p><br><blockquote>  If the reports from the list interest you, we would like to draw your attention: we have already <a href="https://habr.com/company/jugru/blog/416807/">announced the</a> <a href="https://dotnext-moscow.ru/">next DotNext</a> , and there you may be equally interested.  At the same time, tickets are getting more expensive over time, so you shouldn‚Äôt postpone <a href="https://dotnext-moscow.ru/tickets/">buying a ticket</a> to a new DotNext before reviewing all the reports from the previous one! </blockquote></div>
