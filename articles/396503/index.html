The third season of the show will consist of six episodes, to which will add a special "Christmas series".  The team of the series remained unchanged: the author of the script remains its creator - Charlie Brooker, responsible for the appearance of the previous two seasons (and the special episode of "White Christmas"), and Annabelle Jones, formerly involved in the first series of "Black Mirror", was announced as an executive producer. <br><br>  Thus, last year's rumors about the return of the series to the screens under the leadership of the old team were <a href="https://geektimes.ru/post/262176/">confirmed</a> .  It is also interesting to note that the season contains seven episodes at once, which looks unusual compared to the previous two, which consisted of three episodes. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Netflix also published the titles, cast and directors of each episode.  Judging by the list, the show was approached quite thoroughly - as actors, participants of other popular projects like Netflix and other TV channels were announced.

Earlier, Brooker explained the meaning of the ‚ÄúBlack Mirror‚Äù: ‚ÄúAll stories are united only by satire on the lifestyle that is common in modern society‚Äù.  An additional advantage of the show can be called the fact that its authors are British, so the original image of the ‚ÄúBritish‚Äù series with its intrinsic thoroughness only plays into the hands of the audience. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/396503/">https://habr.com/ru/post/396503/</a></p>
