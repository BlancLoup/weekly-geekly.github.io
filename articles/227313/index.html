Over the years, he has seen many online stores and can clearly say what most of them lacked.  He compiled a list of the 46 most relevant tips that he gave to his clients. <br><br>  1. Never leave a letter without an answer.  Only 48 hours, and your client will stop waiting. <br><br>  2. Let the customer see the shipping cost without registration.

      3. If you deliver goods to different regions (countries), make a list of regions in alphabetical order. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  4. Take a photo of your office and add photos to your contacts page. <br><br>  5. The product page should be contrast and concise, without unnecessary information.  Use great quality photos. <br><br>  6. You make a website for the buyer, not for the search engines. <br><br>  7. The client should easily find links to your security and privacy policy, delivery terms and payment methods. <br><br>  8. Inform the customer about the status of his order before he asks about it. <br><br>  9. Use the same type of visual design for each action of the buyer. <br><br>  10. Provide complete information about the product and its models that are in stock. <br><br>  11. Detailed answer all possible questions about the product on the page with its description. <br><br>  12. If you are not sending goods to specific regions, notify the customer in advance. <br><br>  13. Let your employees periodically check the content of your store for spelling errors. <br><br>  14. Make calls free for your customers. <br><br>  15. Show your site to as many friends as possible, let them test it.  And the less they understand in websites, the better. <br><br>  16. Listen to customers, give them the opportunity to comment, adjust feedback, use the information received. <br><br>  17. Specify the real phone number of your office on the ‚ÄúAbout Us‚Äù page. <br><br>  18. Learn to use basic photo editing software and make product photos better. <br><br>  19. Remove all auxiliary navigation elements from the purchase process.  Make the order form one-page, if possible. <br><br>  20. Write, or rather call your client to thank him and confirm the order, it inspires confidence. <br><br>  21. Add your phone number or online consultant window at each stage of the order so that the client can ask for help at any time. <br><br>  22. On your page there should just be a section "popular products". <br><br>  23. Prices must be indicated without reservation and are visible at every stage of the purchase. <br><br>  24. Make sure that by clicking on the thumbnail, the client will see a full-size photo. <br><br>  25. On the product page, make a block that will always be visible.  It should contain the name of the product, its price and the "buy" button. <br><br>  26. The link to the ‚ÄúFAQ‚Äù should be noticeable. <br><br>  27. Deliver the goods as quickly as possible.  Preferably on the same day as possible. <br><br>  28. Make sure that contextual ads send the buyer directly to the product page, the customer is not interested in your home page. <br><br>  29. Make a list of related products and a list of ‚Äúwith this product also buy:‚Äù for each product. <br><br>  30. Send not only promotions and special offers.  Prepare and send really useful material. <br><br>  31. If the product is delivered through an intermediary, supply the client with his coordinates so that he can track the status of the package. <br><br>  32. If you sell the same model, made in different colors, provide a photo of each of them. <br><br>  33. Use large print (14 +) for titles and product names to highlight them and, possibly, increase the number of transitions. <br><br>  34. All calls and questions of the online consultant should be answered by a real person, not a car. <br><br>  35. Promise less, do more. <br><br>  36. Customers with problems have often become loyal fans of your store if their problem has been solved at the highest level. <br><br>  37. Understand when a customer goes to your competitors. <br><br>  38. Make sure that your ‚Äúbuy‚Äù button is always visible and noticeable enough so that the client does not search for it. <br><br>  39. Make sure that the title of the product page is the name of the product, not your company. <br><br>  40. Guarantee a refund and provide a guarantee for all products. <br><br>  41. Experiment with the wording on the CTA button.  It may be better to use ‚Äúadd to cart‚Äù, which sounds less binding than ‚Äúbuy‚Äù or order ‚Äù. <br><br>  42. If you are going to ask the client to subscribe to the newsletter at the time of the order, do it after processing the payment. <br><br>  43. If you can not compete in pricing, compete in the service sector, the range and speed of delivery. <br><br>  44. Add thanks to each message about the order received.  Use your photo and personal data such as your full name and phone. <br><br>  45. Aim for profit. <br><br>  46. ‚Äã‚ÄãContinue to learn: the more you know, the more effective your actions. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/227313/">https://habr.com/ru/post/227313/</a></p>
