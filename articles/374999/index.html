Although education itself cannot ensure sustainability, it is obviously one of the key tools of society.  Educational goals require a fundamental shift - from learning to remember and understand - to learning new, systematic thinking. <br><br>  The real challenge is to develop the ability of all students to solve problems, as well as the development of critical, independent and original thinking.  An education focused only on the mind is no longer enough.  A radical reorientation of the content of education and pedagogy should include the transfer of knowledge derived from past experience, and should also be aimed at expanding the knowledge, skills and capabilities that will be needed to adapt and creatively respond to the future that is still envisaged.  If education is a contract between society and the future, now a new contract is needed;  a contract that is no longer intended to prepare young people for the future, which in many ways is a copy of the past.

      The challenge facing education today is to create conditions that will enable young people to develop what the world social science report calls <b>‚Äúliteracy for the future‚Äù</b> - the ability to withstand the complexity and uncertainty for dynamic participation in the future that we have to collide.  The following are some aspects that we think are necessary for an educational system of the future that is suitable for supporting sustainable development. <br><a name="habracut"></a><blockquote>  Box: UNESCO: Education for Sustainable Development <br>  After the UN General Assembly approved 2005-2014 as the decade of education for sustainable UN development, UNESCO, as a responsible institution, pursued the goal of integrating the principles, values ‚Äã‚Äãand practices of sustainable development into all aspects of education.  This educational work was aimed at changing the behavior of young people and future generations in order to create an ecologically holistic, economically viable and socially equitable future.  At the end of the program in 2014, UNESCO launched a global program of action to stimulate global efforts in education for sustainable development to ensure its contribution to the achievement of the sustainable development goals (SDGs) and the 2030 agenda for sustainable development.  Last July, about 100 participants in the global action program met at UNESCO in Paris to receive a monitoring report, followed by an interim response in 2017 and a final report in 2019. These reports are a label in terms of implementing ESD to provide better and more sustainable future for all. </blockquote>  <b>Education of the future must be active and collective.</b>  Research confirms that perception is weakest for such pedagogical methods as reading or listening to a lecture and that learning is most productive when it is collective, for example, during a discussion, group project or study group.  Eight hundred meta-analyzes covering 50,000 studies of 80 million students between 2009 and 2012 showed that collaborative learning and individual counseling have a positive effect on student learning.  While the average percentage of retention of students with a passive listening to lectures in a class is 5%, with practice it rises to 75%.  The highest percentage ‚Äî 90 ‚Äî is achieved by teaching one student to others.  Thus, the role of the teacher should vary from lecturer to guide, from simply conveying information to promoting self-study and mentoring. <br><blockquote>  Insert: Case from Napa, California <br>  New Technology High School in Napa, California adopted a cooperative education model after Napa turned to a group of companies to help rebuild the high school curriculum so that students are better prepared for a successful career.  Based on company feedback that education was primarily focused on individual activities, rather than the ability to collaborate, the school restructured the pedagogical system to focus on the person, not on the subject.  Today, it instills not only textbook knowledge, but also life skills, a culture of respect, trust and responsibility.  Students organize their own projects and work in groups of their choice.  They are included in the school's decision making process.  The curriculum is project-based, and teachers lead activities instead of lecturing.  One of the criteria by which students are evaluated is work ethic.  The school forces students to help each other and see the benefits that can be obtained when competition is replaced by collaboration.  This model gave rise to a new technological network, consisting of more than 160 schools based on a cooperative learning model. </blockquote> <b>Education of the future should be based on "connectedness".</b>  On a global scale, a developing learning model is a network of relationships between people.  With electronic devices penetrating every aspect of life and learning, it is very easy to forget that education was originally an organic exchange process between two people.  Advances in the Internet and communication technologies that drastically change education through massive open distance courses (ISTC) and virtual reality are valuable and effective only <b>if they contribute to establishing connections between people</b> .  Similarly, education should generate interest, release energy, and actively use each student‚Äôs ability to learn for himself and help others learn. <br><br>  <b>Education of the future must be valuable.</b>  Values ‚Äã‚Äãare the quintessence of human wisdom, accumulated over centuries.  And in a new evolving system, they must embody the fundamental principles for sustainable individual or social implementation.  Values ‚Äã‚Äãare even more than inspirational ideals that provide the energy necessary for the realization of human aspirations.  Values ‚Äã‚Äãare a form of knowledge and a powerful determining factor in human evolution.  These are psychological skills of great practical importance.  Education must be based on values ‚Äã‚Äãthat promote sustainability and overall well-being.  The transition to inculcating sustainable values ‚Äã‚Äãwill mean a paradigm shift in the value system of our present society.  As its goal, it will consider increasing the well-being of both people and the natural systems on which they depend, and not an estimate of the cost for production and consumption.  A conscious focus will be placed on truly universal values, as well as respect for cultural differences.  At the grassroots level, the movement towards sustainable development can be based on deep local values.  Values ‚Äã‚Äãcan create transformational leadership, as well as leadership in thinking that leads to action. <br><br>  <b>The education of the future should focus on sustainability.</b>  Since the science of sustainability is a relatively new discipline, only if it is not part of the traditional culture or the culture of indigenous peoples, including in the educational system, it cannot be based on the centuries-old work or the collective knowledge of many generations.  There is a growing awareness of the need to develop a methodology that could ensure sustainable development.  Not all answers are ready;  in fact, not even all the necessary questions were asked.  Thus, extensive research is needed in all sectors, including the use of interdisciplinary groups in which all interests and points of view are represented, as one of the prerequisites for education in the field of sustainable development.  Thus, research results should be widely reported in discussion clubs and public debates, in which both citizens and politicians will be present.  The wider and more meaningful education and citizen participation will be, the more effective the implementation will be. <br><br>  <b>The education of the future should cultivate integral thinking.</b>  During the last half of the twentieth century, some limitations of analytical thinking (see 2.7) began to be solved by shifting the emphasis on systemic thinking.  Systems thinking focuses on the interconnectedness and interdependence of phenomena and recognizes the complexity, aiming for the concept as a whole.  However, in systems thinking there is a tendency to view reality in rather mechanistic categories, unable to grasp its organic integrity.  The limitations of systems thinking require a transition from mechanistic ideas to more organic ideas about reality.  Our greatest inventions, discoveries, and creative acts become reality when the obvious contradictions disappear.  Integral thinking is thinking that is capable of perceiving, organizing, harmonizing and reuniting individual fragments and achieving a true understanding of the underlying reality - it differs from system thinking, as well as integration differs from aggregation.  Education should present such a comprehensive view of students, regardless of their specific areas of specialization.  <b>Each discipline must also learn to consider themselves in the light of social community.</b> <br><br>  <b>The education of the future must proceed from the pluralism of content.</b>  A change in pedagogy must be accompanied by a change in content.  In this age of information overload and easy access to big data, choosing the right content and developing a curriculum is a very big responsibility.  Social reality is complex and integrated and cannot be explained by a single theory.  Many universities advocate a certain school of thought, especially in the field of law and economics, instead of giving young minds a whole range of conflicting and complementary perspectives. <br><br>  Today's students need an inclusive education in which some forms of knowledge would complement others, rather than exclude and reject them.  An encouraging sign is the recent movement of economists and students of economic universities in Europe, North America and other regions, who have united in protest of intellectual sectarianism in order to demand that all important views be taught, not just a small part of Orthodoxy.  Just as genetic diversity has proven to be critical for human evolution, cultural diversity is necessary for social evolution.  The Finnish education system (and also the French one) is working to overcome sectoralization of curricula, so less attention is given to subjects and more attention is paid to broader topics, such as the European Union or ecology and space, which are interconnected from the point of view of many different disciplines and give students wider overview. <br><br>  Such reflections on the education of the future become practical both at the secondary school level and at the university level, for example, in the schools of the Club of Rome and in North American universities: <br><br>  Inspired by the ‚ÄúNo limits to learning‚Äù report of the Rome Club, the German association has created the Rome Club network of schools.  Under their slogan ‚ÄúThink Globally, Act Locally,‚Äù 15 schools lead students to develop a consciousness of global citizenship.  Schools create learning environments to find global perspectives and reflect on them.  The curriculum is mainly organized into project tasks, in which students focus on the phenomena that they study in groups a year.  Education is focused on interdisciplinary skills, including self-organization, self-awareness, knowledge in the field of large amounts of data and collaboration.  Schools also encourage students to actively participate in meaningful local projects, where they have the chance to train their self-efficacy and develop their potential as a citizen of the world. <br><br>  McGill University and York University in Canada, together with the University of Vermont in the USA, are engaged in education for the Anthropocene, or Ed4A, a complete graduate school system that helps students get to the master's and doctoral studies in management, law, economics and social sciences, as well as systems science and modeling, new professional challenges all over the world.  The existing concern is expanding with massive open online courses mentioned above to double the current number of students (from 40 to 80) and expand its outreach to North America for participating universities in Australia, China and India.  The program recognizes the role of ethics and values ‚Äã‚Äãin shaping managerial and economic experts who understand both natural and social systems in their current form, and not how they have been described in the past.  Member of the Club of Rome Peter Brown is one of the creators of Ed4A.  According to him, the new education system is necessary in order to cope with the new requirements of research in the field of sustainable development.  It is impossible to do "without a complete rethinking of the project of humanity." <br><br>  This is quite a challenge, but the urgent need for education in the field of sustainable development requires this kind of new paradigm.  It is necessary to include sustainability issues in curricula at all levels;  however, this is also not enough to achieve the desired rapid and radical changes in the global economy and in the way people live.  This will require nurturing the next generation with other techniques that can provide greater opportunities for adapting to rapid social change, as well as a strong sense of social responsibility, innovation, and creative thinking.  The educational system of the future is now only in the early stages of its revolutionary transition.  It will have a huge impact on the future of global society because it violates the boundaries established by the physical class, the monastic isolation of the student campus, the unreasonable stability of degrees, courses and hour lectures, social barriers of class divisions and especially economic barriers to accessibility. <br><br>  <i>To be continued...</i> <br><br>  <b>If you are interested, I invite you to join the ‚Äúflashmob‚Äù to translate a 220-page report.</b>  <b>Write in a personal or email magisterludi2016@yandex.ru</b> <br><br><h3>  "Analytics" </h3><br><ul><li>  <a href="http://malakhov.link/come-on-report">"Come on!" - the anniversary report of the Club of Rome</a> </li><li>  <a href="http://perevodika.ru/articles/1197575.html">The anniversary report of the Club of Rome - embalming capitalism</a> </li><li>  <a href="https://www.planet-kob.ru/articles/6832">Club of Rome, jubilee report.</a>  <a href="https://www.planet-kob.ru/articles/6832">Verdict: ‚ÄúThe Old World is doomed.</a>  <a href="https://www.planet-kob.ru/articles/6832">New World is inevitable! ‚Äù</a> </li></ul><br><hr><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">About #philtech</b> <div class="spoiler_text"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/vq/um/p6/vqump6po8z9qddw4v2mmrm7uuks.jpeg" alt="image"><br><br>  <b>#philtech (technology + philanthropy)</b> is an open, publicly described technology that aligns the standard of living of as many people as possible by creating transparent platforms for interaction and access to data and knowledge.
