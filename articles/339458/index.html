  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Uneducated youth: an attempt to summarize and some personal</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  So, in the wake of the three publications of <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/post/339022/">September</a> <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/post/339208/">30</a> , <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/post/339208/">03.10</a> and <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/company/regionsoft/blog/339284/">04.10</a> I decided to take a chance and try to summarize.  Of course, there are not enough comments from large companies with their private schools, internship programs and other things, comments from the university administration (although I will try to cover some of them) and some others.  Of those that I considered (the most difficult thing was to view this bunch of comments) - <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/company/regionsoft/blog/339284/">1</a> , <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/company/regionsoft/blog/339284/">2</a> , <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/company/regionsoft/blog/339284/">3</a> , <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/post/339022/">4</a> .  Therefore, I urge all authors to comment on whether I correctly conveyed their position: <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/users/enchantinggg/" class="user_link">enchantinggg</a> , <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/users/san-smith/" class="user_link">san-smith</a> , <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/users/axelus/" class="user_link">Axelus</a> , <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/users/moondear/" class="user_link">MooNDeaR</a> ,&gt; <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/users/varim/" class="user_link">Varim</a> , <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/users/ternaus/" class="user_link">ternaus</a> , <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/users/pavelmstu/" class="user_link">PavelMSTU</a> . <br><br>  So, at first there will be a simple comparative table, and then some thoughts and suggestions on what to do. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><table><tbody><tr><td>  Controversial position </td><td>  Students </td><td>  Teachers </td><td>  Employers </td></tr><tr><td>  Education system </td><td>  <i>"Yes, everything is rotted here, the system must be changed!"</i> </td><td>  <i>"Yes, everything is rotted here, the system must be changed!"</i> </td><td>  <i>"Yes, everything is rotted here, the system must be changed!"</i> </td></tr><tr><td>  Subjects </td><td>  Absolutely outdated or not necessary in practice. </td><td>  We cannot even change anything, because these are the plans of the Ministry of Education. </td><td>  Are they there pants sit ?! </td></tr><tr><td>  Teacher Competence </td><td>  If you get a strong enough teacher - already luck, if he is also interested in your development - success! </td><td>  The most adequate teachers are ‚Äúasked‚Äù, there are practically no specialists: either the old school or the ideological + routine remains. </td><td>  How can a teacher be competent if he is a theorist ?! </td></tr><tr><td>  Personal qualities of students </td><td>  Well, yes, we are not experienced, but we want to learn and not survive!  We can prove <br>  that we will be useful, just tell me how and give a little time. </td><td>  For the whole group, one and a half Anonymous, who are interested in studying.  In general, 5% of interested students is not so bad. </td><td>  Inexperienced people come, without knowledge and skills, who are unlikely to join the company and ask for wages of their superiors. </td></tr><tr><td>  Practical skills system </td><td>  They don‚Äôt learn anything useful, they don‚Äôt take a job, it‚Äôs impossible to combine, it‚Äôs difficult to get experience, there‚Äôs no time left for the rest (taking youth into account). </td><td>  Even students cannot do all the laboratory work as needed, so what can we say about something more serious? .. You can still do something with one and a half Anonymus, but there is not always time and motivation to teach them to eat. </td><td>  Universities absolutely hammered into practice. </td></tr></tbody></table><br>  At this point, the table ends, because it becomes difficult to isolate something fairly common (however, if I missed something, I will be glad for your additions), and the review of the situation begins. <br><br>  A little bit about yourself.  One of the best students of one of the best gymnasiums in Yekaterinburg, a rather mediocre student at Matmeha St. Petersburg State University (2 years), a fairly good student at ITASU MISiS (3rd year).  As part of the Student Council at MatMeh, I worked actively with the teaching and methodological committee of St. Petersburg State University, including regarding the presentation by students of their wishes in the educational process (up to the opening of a new direction), cooperation with companies in practice and other things and other attempts to build trilateral relations. -Trained-Business.

    <ol><li>  About the education system, as you can see, there is nothing special to say.  As long as the Ministry lowers instructions from above, loading all of the bureaucracy, red tape and reporting, tries to introduce KPI among teachers on the number of students who have settled down or decides which of the two books is strongly recommended for the educational process, and which is not very good is unlikely to become better.  According to my observations, the rigid vertical hierarchy in education practically never worked, except in extreme situations. </li><li>  But with the subjects taught already interesting.  Formally, they must meet the curriculum, the number of hours, competencies and anything else, so much so that it is easier to put to study the creation of cartoons in PowerPoint and declare that it develops a lot of all sorts of skills.  The commission will be pleased.  Informally, a teacher with the approval of the department (and sometimes even without it) can include almost anything in his subject, if the above-mentioned criteria can be justified.  For example, that a commit provided with a comment is a team work and the skill of self-presentation (after all, they are written so that <br>  Committed approved, well, why not electoral speech?!) </li><li>  With the competencies of most teachers in most universities, everything is sad enough, judging by the picture I know, but I‚Äôm not actively agreeing about theorists.  MatMech, where I studied, gave mainly theoretical education.  Only math.  And once again mathematics.  Well, a little physics, mathematical.  Pluses to work with mathematics.  Well, run and talk in English, since the Ministry wants ... For a casual employer, a mathematics student does not know anything useful, and only companies where mathematics is needed in projects understand the price if a particular student has it, of course. </li><li>  Students  These are young people who are quite socially protected so that they do not have to leave school and go to work.  These are people who want to choose a job, moreover, when they are ready for it.  For a part of them questions such as a hostel or an army may be critical, but no more.  They can afford a choice, and as long as the status quo is preserved - they will want a lot, and be able to do a little.  And before that, the grass was greener, yes. <br>  Among all this number of students there are indeed people with burning eyes (ideally), people who want to study (also good) or people who understand why they need to study (quite well).  So they are quite desirable for the recurters, if the students needed the recurters. </li><li>  But with practice everything is bad.  And not the fault of universities, no.  The fault of the companies.  Several large IT companies united at one time and opened the Computer Science Center, because they needed people.  Some small companies openly want to find themselves a cheap and decent programmer among students in exchange for some help to the university.  Other companies enter into agreements with the university on cooperation and give lectures, even supplementary courses lead.  The problem of universities here is one - mostly in the conclusion of such a contract is so much bureaucracy that it is easier to do everything in gray or not at all. </li></ol><br>  What to do with all this? <br><br>  Students - to kick everyone and everyone you can to get the right to manage their education.  Search for lectures, courses, negotiate practices and internships.  And yes, your project is really a great idea, developing a bunch of skills.  But this is all, of course, if you have already played enough in your youth and your future is more precious than your current hobby.  As practice shows, you can ask for as long as you want, if you have something to offer for it.  And this is not a trivial ‚Äúability to learn,‚Äù ‚Äúa desire to work in a team,‚Äù but, first of all, an interest in business. <br><br>  To teachers ... I have only one idea in my head - to conduct private education in the type of clubs for those who need it.  Picking up anonymous and a half from the stream, reading the same thing in different universities, everything can turn out.  But in general - thank you.  And with the holiday. <br><br>  Companies - understand that they do not teach more professionals.  Experts will not go to you just like that.  They can try to buy, you can bring up (also buy, only in a different format) and that's it.  Even students have the right to choose and, all other things being equal, the waiter‚Äôs career may suit them more.  Therefore, if you do not want to be stylish, fashionable and youthful, think about what else can be attractive to a person whose workforce you would like to use.  Only a flexible schedule for a young specialist is a huge plus to the vacancy. <br><br>  Young people are not uneducated.  She is still young and can not cope with the edifice of the Ministry to become a specialist in spite of.  And about those students who are no longer young, you yourself know everything. <br><br>  PS I will tell about my experience and results separately, in the comments, if there is a desire. <br><br>  <b>UPD1:</b> Thanks to <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/users/bopoh13/" class="user_link">bopoh13</a> , which pointed to the <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/users/easimonenko/" class="user_link">easimonenko</a> article, the <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/users/easimonenko/" class="user_link">mdanshina</a> comment in the <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/post/339434/">article</a> from the point of view of the university and ‚Äúas I have a soul‚Äù, the <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/users/aleshqqa1337/" class="user_link">aleshqqa1337</a> <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/post/339512/">article</a> I decided to interview familiar teachers, pick up old contacts and tell about one more side of this problem. <br>  1. As I said, for me, as a participant, at that time, of the student council, it was quite surprising that SPSU takes some courses with Coursera.  Moreover, a sufficient number of teachers (60-80% of my circle of contacts) are ready to regard these courses as actual knowledge of the subject. <br>  2. Since there are private universities both for obtaining a higher education diploma and <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%259D%25D0%25B5%25D0%25B7%25D0%25B0%25D0%25B2%25D0%25B8%25D1%2581%25D0%25B8%25D0%25BC%25D1%258B%25D0%25B9_%25D0%259C%25D0%25BE%25D1%2581%25D0%25BA%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B2%25D1%2581%25D0%25BA%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B9_%25D1%2583%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B2%25D0%25B5%25D1%2580%25D1%2581%25D0%25B8%25D1%2582%25D0%25B5%25D1%2582">not giving it in principle, but with international recognition</a> , speaking about higher education as a whole, it makes sense to exclude similar peaks from both sides.  Including the one and a half Anonymus, who really know why they went to the university, and could even do without it (I could, for example, but the career of a system administrator is not the one I would like to build), as well as the people who come only for the sake of dormitory and respite.  De jure, we have at the exit a lot of qualified software engineers, de facto they are inferior in qualification to schoolchildren with burning eyes.  This is the problem of the industry that needs to be addressed. <br>  3. At the moment, the market really adapts quite well to the existing situation, assessing first of all the profile of the githaba, various courses, even just listened to lectures and internships as more important than a certain diploma.  This is perhaps the best of the indicators available at the moment, but there are often no room for reading books and skills in related fields there. <br><br>  Summary: At the moment, there is practically no education system in IT.  At the very least, the mathematical system of education copes as an adjacent one, but good mathematical universities can be counted on the fingers (IMHO).  And with all this within the framework of the current reality, I personally can offer only 4 solutions: <br><ol><li>  To achieve greater freedom of universities from the Ministry of Education, to raise teachers' salaries, to establish cooperation with business (unrealistic) </li><li>  Try to arrange the educational process in universities so that it formally fits the criteria of the Ministry, but focuses on the laboratory at the university, on the Cursor, on the actual business request (optimistic) </li><li>  Establish cooperative educational institutions such as Computer Science Center, ShAD and others aimed at catching one and a half Anonymus from each stream of each university, to train them and to be an example (because they are highly appreciated from a professional point of view) to the rest (optimistic) </li><li>  Actively, in places, to offer internships and internships with pre-selection (realistic) </li><li>  Leave the situation as it is, hoping that people willing to learn independently (you could) will be enough to meet the demand (pessimetic) </li></ol><br><br>  I will be very happy to make a mistake, honestly.  But when I look at (and looked at) groupmates, for some reason I only remember this monologue. <div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">18+</b> <div class="spoiler_text"><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/l05e8IV5JEQ" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br></div></div></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/339458/">https://habr.com/ru/post/339458/</a></p>
