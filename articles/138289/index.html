  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Overview of a secure flash drive Aegis Secure Key</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  From time to time, here and there, the news of secured flash drives with hardware encryption slipped.  Time passed, the awl grew and then one day I realized that the time had come.  First of all, I opened Yandex Market and through an advanced search began to look at what the market offers us.  The list of proposals was just a couple of sheets.  As I studied the specifics, I outlined the basic requirements.  Perhaps the most important was the question of working without additional programs from any OS.  Thus, almost all the proposals instantly disappeared from view, as most flash drives, when connected to a PC, launched the firmware, requesting a password and further decrypting the container.  And as expected, this approach worked only under windows.  As a result, devices with a physical keyboard began to spin in sight - entered the code, inserted it into usb, and work.  Yandex offered only Corsair Flash Padlock 2. But in many security parameters, it did not suit me.  Searching on the Internet was decently surprised by the fact that there is practically no information about such devices in Russian.  On Habr√©, I skipped a post about an amazing <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/gadgets/135378/">IStorage datAshur</a> flash drive.  Impressive.  But that's not the problem.  Such devices are prohibited for sale in Russia.  Ebay, Amazon - the search did not give the desired results.  And then I see the Aegis Secure Key.  By type and by description - one to one datAshur, only from another company.  Ebay - the result is 0, Amazon - the result is positive.  16Gb - $ 125.  Month of waiting, notice, turn, joy. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/f01/79c/93a/f0179c93acff64c4c118e7821b318f3d.jpg"><br><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  Holding for the first time in the hands of a new toy, first of all you pay attention to the pleasant weight, the slight coolness of the metal case.  Smoothly remove the case and ... intercom, covered throughout the body with material similar to soft-touch. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/539/0d9/3b4/5390d93b4ac405d9f65b4ba6de02b9e1.jpg"><br>  On the front side are ten number buttons, one system and three LEDs. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/8f4/f4b/144/8f4f4b144f27b079cfa5d5d12eb8ba7c.jpg"><br>  On the reverse side - useful information that tells us that the flash drive is 16gb, uses AES 256 bit encryption, and works from a lithium-polymer battery that is recharged from usb.  Despite the fact that the specification indicates protection against water and shock, I‚Äôm not ready to check this yet. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/a76/c35/7d1/a76c357d1a48d9ac6a0dd376314f4229.jpg"><br>  Let's go back to the button bar.  Despite the fact that the physical dimensions of the 80x20x10 mm flash drive (along with the case), the buttons turned out to be very successful, of sufficient size, 5x5 mm.  Since my fingers are not large, pressing the buttons is not difficult.  The buttons are quite tight, tactile move.  Pressing feels good with a slight click.  The material of the buttons is made of good, hard rubber, on which no traces (dents) of solid objects, such as nails, are left.

      Well, it's time to see how it works!  We stick in usb ..., the red LED flashes several times, then the blue flashes constantly and ... oh, the usb device is not recognized. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/c9b/c21/0bf/c9bc210bf86152d617c90d668b8c7c42.jpg"><br>  Open the instructions, find out the factory password, press the key, enter 11223344 and again the key.  Friendly blinking green LED and now we have 30 seconds to connect the drive to the port.  Installation of new equipment, 10 seconds and a window with a choice of tasks.  We open properties. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/736/931/fe6/736931fe6ec0d35692eb0e2a910b18d6.png"><br>  We try to throw the film, weighing 700mb.  The speed starts from 42mb / s and ends with 21mb / s.  The read speed does not exceed 12mb / s.  Apparently affects the decoding on the fly.  Neither fat32 nor ntfs make a significant difference. <br><br>  Breaking into: <br>  Check protection against brute force.  We make 10 incorrect attempts and the red LED is lit without blinking, the more it tries to enter codes does not give us.  We program a new password, connect to usb and voila, we are asked to format the disk. <br>  I certainly will not open the flash drive, so we will believe the manufacturer.  According to the manufacturer, everything inside is covered with hard epoxy, which destroys the chip when trying to remove it. <br>  Thermorectal cryptanalysis?  As far as I understand, there is no possibility to customize the data deletion code ... <br><br>  Total. <br>  Pretty high quality and reliable product, relatively inexpensive, compact and stylish.  Excellent data protection in case of loss or theft of the device.  I wanted to try to break into sections and see what happens, but hard disk programs do not see it.  I will be glad to answer questions. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/138289/">https://habr.com/ru/post/138289/</a></p>
