  <section class="page js-page"><h1>On the issue of Federal Universities</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Yeah, you guessed it, now there will be a cry from the heart.  So, in the glorious city of Yekaterinburg there were two universities of the USTU-UPI and the USU.  Good such universities, normal, at the UPI, for example, the only academic group in the country remained, which is engaged in the development of processors, with that, to provide spacecraft, and not coffee makers.  Ural State University is the forge of programmers for the entire region, for Microsoft (for there are connections: the current head of Microsoft Research is a graduate of the Ural State University), for Yandex (because they are in Yekaterinburg) and for Intel with Google (for they teach really well). <br><br>  But it took our government to unite these universities in the Ural Federal University.  No sooner said than done.  And it turned out as a result of UrFU, which has the 2nd place in the country among universities in terms of science and success.  The organization is now new, you need to renegotiate labor contracts, and here is the clarification I received about the level of new salaries: <br><br><a name="habracut"></a>

    <blockquote>  Michael, hello, come to my department, I'll show it to you.  We otkserokopili.  I can only say that the basic rate of the assistant is 5500, the senior is 6195, the associate professor is 6820, the professor is 7260, the head of the caf√© is 7735. These are the basic rates (without extra charges for the position, academic title, degree, etc. </blockquote><br><br>  It is surprising two facts.  First, it is some kind of nonsense, when the difference between a professor and an assistant is less than 2,000 rubles.  I myself am an assistant, and I know professors, and the difference in coolness is certainly not for 2000 pulls, but many, many, many, many more.  Okay, let's say, I agree that the assistant is a petty position, which costs 5,500, but, fuck, professor!  I'm just in shock. <br><br>  Secondly ... Gentlemen, the <strong>Federal</strong> University, which is ranked number 2 in the country (and not just. For example, RuCTF is the brainchild of USU employees; regular high places of USU students at ACM Olympiads are their own (other people, but USU staff) merit; 4th place in the qualifying round for DevCon 19 is also; this is only one department, without mentioning his scientific work) ... What kind of fucking innovations are all the time when the salary of cleaning staff at the <strong>regional</strong> hospital is twice as high ( understand, really 2 times higher) than that of Professor Federal  Foot of the University? <br><br>  To make it immediately clear, I am not complaining about the level of my income, because in Ural Federal University part-time part-time, there are other sources of funding for my ideas, but, damn, for the Power, something bitter and insulting ... <br><br>  I just want to publish this information so that ... Well.  There was knowledge among people about how really our government relates to science, innovation and education ... Do not ... Well, judge for yourself, the Federal University, which has a close to a billion budget (if it believes TV).  And such a crap ... </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/122989/">https://habr.com/ru/post/122989/</a></p>
