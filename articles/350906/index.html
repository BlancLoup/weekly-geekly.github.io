      Perhaps you also made any predictions, so now you have a great opportunity to understand how accurate your predictions were. <br><br>  And of course, observing all the traditions of the Internet community, in the second part we will try to predict what 2018 will bring to us.  Measure in a year. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h3>  Forecasts for 2017 </h3><br><ol><li>  <b>Apple will continue to lose its steepness</b> - Well what can we say, there is some truth in this.  First, the sales of the new iPhone 8 and X fell short of the expectations placed on them;  secondly, the list of complaints from users is growing exponentially and it is increasingly possible to hear from people that the company is losing its grip and reputation.  And thirdly, how many people, disappointed with the poor quality of iOS 11, have switched to the Galaxy?  - LOT! </li><li>  <b>The introduction of cloud technologies will slow down</b> - does anyone really think so?) No guys, this technology is in full swing.  It is possible to say more, the year 2017 was marked for them by such significant progress that even simply listing all the new cloud products and services on one line is not real, because  there were a great many </li><li>  <b>China will lose its greatness and glory as a gigantic manufacturing center</b> - obviously, this did not happen.  And, probably, it will not happen in the coming years. </li><li>  <b>The Internet of Things will continue to rotate the wheel of progress</b> - 2017 was marked by an increase in the number of various devices and ways to connect them.  At the moment, there are more IoT devices in the world than smartphones or PCs.  In addition, the Internet of Things is being actively implemented in all areas, including the greatest progress seen in the automotive industry.  And this trend will continue in 2018.  Therefore, the forecast is completely true. </li><li>  <b>AMD will take the lead in sales</b> - it‚Äôs said - done!  AMD significantly increased its benchmarks throughout 2017.  Sales are growing, analysts who predicted a different result are nervously sweating their palms, the consumer segment is expanding, performance is better than ever.  2018 will open up even more new opportunities for AMD and its partners, so this is a great chance for AMD to consolidate the success of products released in 2017.  Recall that the world saw AMD Ryzen and AMD EPYC processors, as well as Radeon RX Vega video cards. </li><li>  <b>Augmented reality (AR) will overtake virtual reality (VR)</b> - And again to the point.  Well, of course, a huge role was played by the success and general fanaticism of the game Pokemon Go, which (for those who may not yet be in the know) is an application that works with augmented reality.  Some analysts and companies believe that at the current level of development of technologies, AR is more ready to enter the mass market than VR.  Microsoft Hololens, as well as Apple and Google with their ARKit and ARCore tools, are also grateful for the successful forecast. </li><li>  <b>Network neutrality in the United States will fail</b> - one of the most high-profile forecasts came true.  On December 14, 2017, the Federal Communications Regulatory Commission of the United States voted by one vote to abolish the principle of net neutrality, introduced in 2015 under President Barack Obama.  Recall the essence of the principle: any information on the Internet is considered equally important, regardless of its source, in other words, access to services and sites on the network must be unhindered for all users.  According to this principle, providers were forbidden to block or regulate Internet resources and charge a fee for priority access from sites or other online services. </li><li>  <b>Windows 10 will improve sales results</b> - Web analysts from Net Applications examined the results of Windows 10 and Windows 7 sales (compared with results for December 2016 and 2017), the results showed that the percentage of sales of Windows 7 remains higher, but in 2017 Windows 10 added 9 points, while Windows 7 lost 4. That is,  it is technically possible to say that the forecast was justified. </li><li>  <b>Amazon and Microsoft continue to dominate the cloud area</b> - it was not hard to guess, however, Google does not agree with this.  By the way, if we are talking about cloud resources, in the near future there will be an article-review of the list of clouds, where you can get a free place to use </li></ol><br><h3>  What brings us the year 2018? </h3><br>  Ok, now let's try to play psychics and predict what awaits us this year.  Place your bets, gentlemen. <br><br><ol><li>  <b>The stunning success of serverless data processing</b> - perhaps this is already clear to everyone.  Discussions and disputes around this topic have been boiling for a long time, progress does not stand still and technologies are developing at a breakneck pace.  As soon as people cast aside the name of technology into a stupor at the first glance and realize all the advantages, deafening success will not keep you waiting. </li><li>  <b>Google will strengthen its position</b> - of course, it will not take the lion‚Äôs share of the market from Amazon and Microsoft, but it will definitely be able to present competitive products to users.  Currently, Diana Green, head of cloud technologies at Google, is redrawing the company's system of interaction with its customers, and Cisco, which is a partner of Google, will contribute to strengthening market positions. </li><li> <b>Peripheral computing will continue to grow</b> - Due to the increasing popularity of the Internet of Things, the increasing amount of data used by mobile devices, and the growth of highly distributed applications in enterprises, we are faced with the fact that data processing must be more extensive.  Of course, the construction of large data centers will help solve some problems, however, there are things that require a more balanced approach. </li><li>  <b>2 functional advantages of artificial intelligence</b> - One of the main functional advantages of using artificial intelligence will certainly be the use of this technology in areas where a one-second response is necessary, for example, in terms of intrusion detection.  The firewall certainly performs its functions, but it is obvious that simply notifying the administrator of suspicious actions is not enough.  Artificial intelligence will not only detect penetrations, but also take all possible actions to ensure security until the administrator directly confronts this fact (after all, people are not robots and cannot spend 24/7 at the computer).  Another major functional advantage will be the possibility of correcting or correcting the so-called ‚Äúhuman factor‚Äù.  After all, even the most attentive workers sooner or later make a mistake, artificial intelligence does not make mistakes.  Of course, if he is well programmed (by man). </li><li>  <b>Big data will be less</b> - A recent study by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology has shown that big data often means bad data.  And as data increases in exabytes, companies will finally become more discriminating about the data they collect and store, following the path of discarding unnecessary information. </li><li>  <b>The growth of smart cities</b> - the Internet of Things will find its vocation to cut ‚Äúsmart cities‚Äù - intelligent street lights and bus stops, autonomous public transport, traffic, weather, and other decisions related to quality of life.  If now this prevails mainly in the capital giants, then expectations are placed on the reincarnation of smaller cities and towns.  The only barrier will be whether there is money in the city‚Äôs budget for such technologies. </li><li>  <b>Companies will no longer need HDDs</b> - we expect two things: the amount of memory will increase many times and it will be possible to fully support SSD in a virtual environment.  In combination, these things will make the SSD very promising, not only within the buffer between the memory and the traditional disk, but also within the framework of the usual full-fledged storage.  And right now, there are many supplies of NAND memory, so prices will remain low.  We remind you that <a href="https://vps.house/">VPS</a> (virtual server) on SSD works many times faster than on HDD </li><li>  <b>‚ÄúWhite-box‚Äù servers will dominate the IT industry</b> - Even now, non-titled low-end server manufacturers, such as Quanta and SuperMicro, are particularly popular in hyper-scalable data centers (from Amazon to Facebook), but the conservative IT environment is still preferred by Dell and Dell brands. HPE.  Let's see what happens in 2018, we put the fact that the unbranded servers will get everyone's attention and show that the label is not the main thing. </li><li>  <b>Closing data centers will slow down</b> - More recently, IT has literally become obsessed with the desire to become independent of its data centers, to put it simply, to get rid of this headache.  But ... faced with a number of difficult but instructive lessons, the fervor subsided a bit.  After all, everyone understood that the cloud service from Amazon will not be able to accommodate everything they want (especially data storage).  Therefore, no matter how much I want to get rid of the centers, IT will still have to reluctantly be content with their services, albeit with less commitment. </li><li>  <b>Intel will buy Marvell</b> - after buying Cavium, Marvell is ready to become a major player in the ARM market.  In turn, this fact will help Intel get into the ARM business and thereby increase its revenues.  Therefore, we expect transactions and the release of Intel to a new market. </li><li>  <b>The popularity of water cooling will continue to grow</b> - initially the technology of water cooling was used "for fun", so to speak for overclocking.  And what do we see now?  This method is firmly included in the proposed options for cooling in data centers.  Of course, the air performs its cooling function, but with an increase in the density of the racks, something more is required.  Water is hundreds of times more efficient than air and is ideal for cooling new 32-core server processors.  By the way, our <a href="https://vps.house/">VDS</a> servers with <a href="https://habr.com/company/vps_house/blog/354940/">extreme performance</a> work on water cooling. </li></ol><br>  <b>Maybe you have your own rating expectations and forecasts?</b>  <b>- We will be happy to discuss in the comments.</b> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/350906/">https://habr.com/ru/post/350906/</a></p>
