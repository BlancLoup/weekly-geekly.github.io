When I asked why, a friend told me about the general impression that he had in the process of interaction with the products of these companies. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  It is worth making a reservation that we are both students of the Bauman Moscow State Technical University, third-year students who do not carry out an in-depth analysis of serious issues, but simply exchange views. <br><br>  So, my friend noticed that on the one hand we have a nice looking Yandex, with flexible search and lots of useful products that the company is developing, like Taxi, Drive and the like, but also that it uses a convenient Yandex Browser, which, though written on Chromium, has a ton of useful chips on top.  And on the other hand Mile.  Ugly mail, few opportunities, no such abundance of projects as Yandex and, of course, Amigo's browser with Mail.ru Agent, which are installed on your PC with any pirated software from the Internet (here he clearly forgot YandexBar).

    <h3>  What happened next </h3><br>  It was difficult to argue with his arguments, but I also did not agree with the conclusions my friend made.  Then we decided to discuss seriously all the pros and cons, based primarily on personal experience. <br><br>  I began by saying that if Mail does not use the name of a company in the name of its units, as Yandex does (Yandex.Food, Yandex.Taxi, etc.), this does not mean that they do not have similar projects (Delivery Club, Citymobile, etc.).  Moreover, I noticed that there are even more large projects that connect the site to Mail, the latter, comparing it with Yandex.  Among them are social networks such as VKontakte, Odnoklassniki and My World. <br><br>  The key point in our dispute was the <b>educational programs of</b> companies.  This did not affect online courses, we discussed only face-to-face classes. <br><br>  Yandex Business Card is <a href="https://yandexdataschool.ru/">School of Data Analysis.</a>  There, students and graduates of engineering universities are trained in four areas - Data Science, BigData, Machine Learning and Data Analysis in Applied Sciences (whatever that may mean).  And the backbone of the educational program of Mile is formed by Technoprojects - semester and two-year courses that teach students on the basis of leading technical universities of Moscow and St. Petersburg - <a href="https://park.mail.ru/">MSTU</a> , <a href="https://track.mail.ru/">MIPT</a> , <a href="https://atom.mail.ru/">MEPI</a> , <a href="https://sphere.mail.ru/">MSU</a> and <a href="http://polis.mail.ru/">St. Petersburg Polytech</a> .  Both those and others, I think, need no introduction. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/7b7/cb9/6ca/7b7cb96ca1af79a2eb3bded2f49ca73a.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/f80/2eb/ad6/f802ebad67a0a62b210d64dd2aea4757.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  The range of specialties of Maila is much broader than in Yandex, but in terms of preparation we decided to keep Mail and Yandex on the same level. <br><br>  Educational programs are free and available after passing the entrance test.  Why do companies do this?  To popularize the it sphere in the Russian Federation, perhaps.  But, to be sure, one of the main goals is to recruit interns. <br><br><h3>  Compare offices </h3><br>  Maybe my natural interest played, or maybe there was just nothing to do, but I visited the offices of both companies more than once. <br><br>  First, I got into Mail.ru, which is located at Metro Airport.  They told about the educational program there, they took excursions.  I will not go into details.  And Yandex had open lectures on working with data in the company.  There was also a job fair for students and graduates who want to try themselves in IT. <br><br>  And what will I say?  Both here and there the information was presented in an accessible and interesting way, but in Yandex, after all, the speakers handled a little better.  For the rest, I prefer mail.ru.  Why?  Let's start with the fact that the excursions around the offices in Mail were conducted by people who are not the first year in the company, occupy high positions and answered a lot of questions in the process, which then interest me.  The girls who communicated with us in Yandex were only pleasant and sweet, and only their work ended in taking us from point A to point B, it was difficult for them to learn something about the company.  Here, I believe, Mail approached more responsible.  Well, the office itself at the last one I liked more, on a large scale somehow everything is done, cordially and more majestically, although there is completely a matter of taste.  Pleased with a fresh bar with fruit and orange juice for visitors, cookies and coffee.  While in Yandex, although it was possible to drink hot tea with biscuits, the service was clearly inferior to Maila.  Trifle, but nice. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/bd4/31e/74c/bd431e74cf29a2a7d73c6fbb6feac30a.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/e69/1fc/689/e691fc689d5b867374077d2d3e362185.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><h3>  What is the result </h3><br>  Surprisingly, after an hour of reasoning, each remained with him, and I could not convince a friend.  Although my other friend, with whom we visited both Yandex and Mail.ru, also treated the latter with great warmth.  But to each his own. <br><br>  <b>And what do you think?</b> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/445486/">https://habr.com/ru/post/445486/</a></p>
