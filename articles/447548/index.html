However, how practical is this solution for small and medium enterprises?  Will an enterprise with 100, 50 or 15 computers gain significant benefits by implementing virtualization technology? <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  <b>Pros and cons of VDI for small and medium businesses</b> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/i2/by/ii/i2byiih-uiordywy_-juyyp7tag.png"><br><br>  When it comes to implementing VDI in small and medium-sized enterprises, you need to take into account a number of pros and cons.

    <h3>  Benefits </h3><br>  - <b>Reduced administrative costs</b> <br><br>  Despite the fact that most small and medium-sized enterprises have IT departments, they are usually quite small and overloaded with routine tasks, such as troubleshooting network problems and server failures, fighting malware, and even handling requests for changing passwords.  The centralized nature of VDI helps to reduce the burden on IT professionals by removing from them a number of administrative and maintenance tasks for end devices. <br><br>  - <b>Increased service life of legacy client devices</b> <br><br>  Due to budget constraints, small and medium-sized enterprises seek to maximize the life of each device.  Since most of these applications are processed on a central server, VDI allows enterprises to repurpose obsolete devices, postponing their replacement. <br><br><h3>  disadvantages </h3><br>  - <b>Absolute dependence on Internet connection</b> <br><br>  VDI desktops are delivered over the network, so they are inefficient in environments where the Internet connection is unreliable or completely missing.  For this reason, most VDI solutions include global network optimizers to compensate for network connection problems to some extent. <br><br>  - <b>Difficulty to deploy</b> <br><br>  Most VDI solutions, such as Citrix Virtual Apps and Desktops (formerly called XenDesktop) and VMWare Horizon, are very difficult to configure, so enterprises have to contact third-party IT consultants who have been certified by this solution, or acquire their own expensive certified professionals. <br><br>  - <b>Impractical for organizations with very few computers</b> <br><br>  Among other things, most VDI solutions are very expensive.  It is hardly worth investing in VDI, having a small number of physical computers.  In this situation, it would be wiser to use the services of third-party providers offering managed VDI services. <br><br>  There are several exceptions, such as Parallels RAS, that are easy to install and are not so expensive.  However, there are difficulties here: it may be difficult to convince of the need to purchase executives who are used to trusting only world famous brands. <br><br>  Despite these difficulties, current and new technological and economic factors in Russia favor the introduction of VDI. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/nr/ci/rz/nrcirzlwf9qzjmofmshxopqzuwg.png"><br><br><h3>  Ideal environment for implementing VDI </h3><br>  First, it is an inexpensive Internet connection service.  A broadband connection in Russia costs an average of just $ 10 (about 645 rubles) per month ‚Äî a third or even a quarter of the cost of such a connection in the United States.  And cheapness does not mean bad quality at all: the speed of Internet connection in large cities is very high. <br><br>  Since VDI desktops are usually delivered over the Internet (unless used within the same local network), this factor is a huge advantage in terms of total cost of ownership. <br><br>  Currently, wireless connectivity is provided over 4G networks, but the leading mobile operators in Russia have already begun to deploy LTE Advanced networks.  Thus, preparations are underway for the launch of 5G networks in 2020, and that by 2025, 80% of the population should become 5G networks. <br><br>  These ambitious plans are carried out with the support of the state and such major telecommunications operators as Megafon, Rostelecom and MTS, which makes the prospects for the introduction of VDI even more promising. <br><br>  With a speed of several gigabits and delays of less than a millisecond, 5G networks will significantly improve the convenience of VDI users: in terms of speed, virtual desktops can be compared with locally installed computers.  It is likely that after the introduction of this technology, there will also be no need for global network optimizers or application accelerators. <br><br><h3>  How small and medium enterprises can recoup investments in VDI </h3><br>  Even without 5G networks, the high availability of the Internet in Russia today makes VDI an acceptable option for small and medium businesses.  At the same time, enterprises need to exercise due diligence in choosing a solution that does not carry undue risks.  If they manage to find a supplier offering trial versions of their product, they should not miss this opportunity and assess whether a particular solution meets their needs before purchasing it. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/447548/">https://habr.com/ru/post/447548/</a></p>
