This document assumes the introduction of the responsibility of Internet sites for the safety of user data from closed profiles.  The developers of the bill believe that social networks can monopolize the data market, therefore they offer certain measures to overcome this situation. <br><br>  The document proposes informing users of the user‚Äôs account‚Äôs Internet sites about the type of social network.  For example, if the site is open, the user must agree that his data will become publicly available to an unlimited number of people. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  If the site provides privacy settings, giving the user the opportunity to close his account, then it is responsible for the security of non-public information.  The authors of the bill believe that any legal restriction of access to publicly available information allows creating unequal conditions for domestic and foreign data market players.

      The authors intend to prepare the text of this bill by the end of November.  Then he will be sent for consideration to the CE working group, and after that - for approval to the federal government bodies, as <a href="https://www.kommersant.ru/doc/3804410">reported by Kommersant</a> . <br><br>  By the way, Deputy Prime Minister Maskim Akimov knows about the preparation of this bill.  Moreover, his representatives report that the document is not included in the priority package.  In turn, in "Rostelecom" claim that the amendments are already being studied, and representatives of the department will participate in their discussion.  According to the Ministry of Economy, in case of liberalization of the mode of working with publicly available data, it is necessary to provide for compensation mechanisms, as well as additional protection of human and citizen rights. <br><br>  The authors of the bill call the most popular sites "Vkontakte", Instagram, Facebook, YouTube, "Classmates" and Twitter.  In the social networks of the Russian-speaking segment of the Internet more than 200 million Russian-active profiles.  They generate more than 90 million messages per day. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/70b/2d7/195/70b2d7195a79bc8c997dcd03331b1e51.jpg"></div><br>  <i><font color="gray">Source: kommersant.ru</font></i> <br><br>  With regard to the current situation, personal data can be publicly available only with the consent of the subject.  Experts believe that if the data will be disclosed without warning to an unlimited number of persons, this may lead to a violation of the rights of citizens, as well as jeopardize the business of Internet companies.  ‚ÄúThis may affect the rights of users who choose public accounts to post data,‚Äù said Karen Ghazaryan, leading analyst at the Russian Association of Electronic Communications. <br><br>  As for the social networks themselves, representatives of both Vkontakte and Odnoklassniki stated that the initiative of the authors of the project does not prioritize the interests of users, and also does not take into account world trends in working with their data.  <a href="https://tass.ru/obschestvo/5808764">Reports</a> about <a href="https://tass.ru/obschestvo/5808764">it</a> TASS. <br><br>  ‚ÄúThe bill threatens the confidentiality of information from Russian Internet users; in fact, it allows any third-party organizations to collect data without their demand.  Our team is confident that every person has the right to independently determine what information and with whom to share, ‚Äùa Vkontakte representative said. <br><br>  ‚ÄúIf the data will be transferred to third parties for commercial use and without the consent of the users, no one can guarantee protection against their malicious use.  At the same time, users will not be able to control in any way what information about them is currently available, ‚Äùthe Odnoklassniki say. <br><br>  As for the concept of regulating the turnover of user data, there is no text yet.  According to representatives of the Digital Economy Autonomous Non-Profit Organization, the business has just begun to discuss the main points of this concept.  The content will be determined by the business community with the support of state representatives. <br><br><blockquote><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/jy/sd/rr/jysdrr7tqgfjt50wtcshw89ctho.png" align="left"><h3>  Minute of care from UFO </h3><br>  This material could cause contradictory feelings, so before writing a comment, refresh something important in your memory: <br><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">How to write a comment and survive</b> <div class="spoiler_text"><ul><li>  Do not write abusive comments, do not go to the person. </li><li>  Refrain from using obscene language and toxic behavior (even in a veiled form). </li><li>  To report comments that violate the rules of the site, use the "Report" button (if available) or <a href="https://habr.com/feedback/%3Ftype%3D4">a feedback form</a> . </li></ul><br>  What to do if: <a href="https://habr.com/info/help/karma/">minus karma</a> |  <a href="https://habr.com/info/help/sandbox/">blocked account</a> <br><br>  ‚Üí <a href="https://habr.com/info/help/other/">Code of authors Habra</a> and <a href="https://habr.com/info/help/other/">habraetiket</a> <br>  ‚Üí <a href="https://habr.com/info/help/rules/">Full site rules</a> </div></div></blockquote></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/430462/">https://habr.com/ru/post/430462/</a></p>
