The Bridge by Ty Tailor</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Habr√© is full of mathematicians and physicists who will be interested to learn about one interesting computer game ‚ÄúThe Bridge‚Äù.  She is not so fresh, I am not her author, and she hardly gets into the subject of Habr, but I think that for this indie game there will be admirers here.  Already 30 minutes as I completed the passage of the mirror part of the game - still impressed, and I would like someone else except me to be pleased with myself, mathematics, Newton and Escher. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/622/ad6/b10/622ad6b105b53105361d937982ba4c09.png" alt="image"><br><br><a name="habracut"></a><h4>  Beautiful words about the game </h4><br>  First of all I will give a link to the game site and translate the description from off.site: <a href="http://thebridgeisblackandwhite.com/">http://thebridgeisblackandwhite.com/</a>

      The Bridge is a two-dimensional puzzle game that forces the player to overestimate his understanding of physics and perspectives.  This is the meeting of Isaac Newton and Maurits Cornelis Escher.  Control the forces of gravity to move across the ceiling, as if on the floor, traveling through impossible architectural objects.  Explore the worlds that with each step become more complex and diverse, full of unique details and bringing intellectual satisfaction to completion.  The Bridge presents the game as an art, with exquisite hand-made graphics, made in black and white lithography technique. <br><br>  From the outset, The Bridge was conceived as an affordable game and intellectual occupation.  The minimum set of character and world controls allows anyone to concentrate on the game, whether you are a gamer or not.  Each stage of the game opens up new nontrivial tasks, built on concepts, presented in previous levels.  The stunning design of the game, the unison of the fantastic visual world and the addictive environment resulted in a dozen awards and nominations from international gaming competitions. The Bridge is still the subject of attention of the gaming press. <br><br><ul><li>  48 puzzles unlike each other, requiring a new approach to solving </li><li>  Gravity control, vortexing, parallel measurements and other concepts in a world where the laws of physics appear in a new form </li><li>  Esher worlds with non-existent architecture in the style of black and white lithography </li><li>  An alternative version of the game opens upon completion of the main story, including alternative advanced versions of 24 previous puzzles </li><li>  The system of unwinding reduces the fear of making a mistake when passing and try any idea. </li></ul><br><br><h4>  Your 5 kopecks </h4><br>  If you are interested in The Bridge, then you can already go buy and start turning the world upside down.  And I still have to sweat and justify the Game Development hub assigned to the post, which prompted me to publish this post. <br><br>  The Bridge authors: Ty Taylor and Mario Casta√±eda.  The project began as Tilor‚Äôs master‚Äôs thesis at Computer Science.  At the very beginning, Mario joined the project, becoming the main artist, who also performed the architecture project at that time.  The authors continued working on the game after graduation from the institution - turning it into a professional indie game of high quality. <br><br>  Everything, the whole three lines about Game Dev wrote - did not begin to dig more.  I add my own words, and then a complete translation.  The game is very exciting and really makes the brains move, especially pleased with the mirror part.  In the credits for the game, I did not see information about the Russification, he played in English.  However, there are few words there, thoughts of a mad mathematician at the end of each part and a couple of phrases on the bridge and when approaching the house.  The game still has achievements and hidden fireflies, which I never found except for one random one.  Achievements 9 out of 16, maybe I will finish it later, there are moles and puzzles left ... <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/daea9cMh67g%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700021,15700186,15700191,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhguK0w0xsgRxbXW9UZNkvR_6h8AFw" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  The game is approved by the quantum astrophysicist guild and has no ESRB restrictions.
