The last couple of months we have devoted to the manufacture and debugging of prototypes.  And one of them got to testing one very good person.

      Peter took part at the start of the project, having completed a couple of tasks in the programming part (at that time Emvio was still at the layout stage).  But after that I switched to another project and was not aware of the latest changes in ours.  Therefore, the proposal to test the prototype for compliance with the testimony of the device internal sensations was for him a pleasant surprise.  We got the opportunity to take a fresh look at our device.  And Peter - see first-hand how his stress level changes during the day. <br><br>  So, I give the floor to the author of our post today. <br><br><h4>  One day with Emvio or tracking the level of stress in action (by <a href="http://geektimes.ru/users/petrpopov/" class="user_link">petrpopov</a> ) ... </h4><a name="habracut"></a><br><br><h5>  8.15am </h5><br>  I take a test sample of the device for the test.  I have been studying psychology and internal processes in a person for quite a long time, which is why it is quite interesting for me to participate in testing.  Look at your condition and correlate it with ‚Äúreal‚Äù data.  Assess your ability to control emotions and stress.  I am familiar with the Emvio project itself and even participated in it a little, so testing is doubly interesting to me.  Recently, the concept of the project has changed several times.  The current version of the project is very interesting - you can monitor the level of stress, analyze the data, compare them with some events from your own life.  This opens up a lot of opportunities to change your own emotional state, if you, of course, are ready for it yourself. <br><br>  I put the device on my hand.  At first, there is pressure from the optical sensor.  After about half an hour, this sensation completely disappears and the device, by analogy with the wristwatch, ceases to be felt completely.  Only constantly attracts attention to itself.  Still, this is a new thing for consciousness.  I constantly want to check the current readings, see what the device is now showing.  Soon the brain gets used to this, allowing you to do all your business, not paying attention to the prototype. <br><br><h5>  8:47 on the clock.  Stress level, according to the sensor - 3 </h5><br>  Well, quite a ‚Äúhealthy‚Äù meaning.  Morning, the working day has not yet begun, the brain is in a calm state. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/d0a/090/c68/d0a090c68a464ac6b14d15c1cbb1ddae.jpg"><br><br>  In the current period of life, my working day is not quite typical.  I do not go to the office and work for myself - I invent and implement various projects in which one way or another there is a need to develop server-side web applications.  This allows you to build a working day at your own discretion, so at 9 am I usually do not stay in the subway, but put my brain in order for a productive day. <br><br>  For this, breathing exercises and meditation are performed every morning.  Sometimes yoga. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/a1d/1a0/47d/a1d1a047d0cd4984b13f1b96f21ba092.jpg"><br><br>  Today - quickly enough, about 20 minutes for everything.  But the result is still there, and its device also fixes. <br><br><h5>  9:20 AM  Stress Level - 0! </h5><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/038/442/bb7/038442bb722545c58098b3d98a1753d6.jpg"><br><br>  However, this quickly passes, it is impossible to be constantly in such a ‚Äúalpha‚Äù state, to the successes of Buddhist monks I am still very far away.  For the sake of interest, I sometimes glance at the device - the level quickly rises to the value of 1, and then, after a while, to 3. Indicators 3 and 4 hold on for quite a long time, almost all day. <br><br><h5>  11:45 am </h5><br>  Going to the subway to the other end of the city.  The Moscow metro can not be loved for a lot of things.  It is dark, dirty and incredibly noisy.  This noise is very painful for the brain, so noise canceling headphones are a real necessity for those who have sensitive hearing.  And the subway can not be loved for a large number of people, an extremely small zone of personal comfort and, frankly, not always convenient navigation. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/da7/093/fd8/da7093fd82ec433d909266de3216f9db.jpg"><br><br>  In general, this place can be a real nightmare for the introvert.  However, this is only my opinion and it describes the whole set of inconveniences that I once experienced in this place.  At some point in time, a few years ago, I was able to negotiate with myself and stop experiencing the stress of visiting the subway.  Now I love to use the subway.  First of all, due to the fact that it allows you to very accurately calculate your time.  In the second, no matter how paradoxical it may sound, because of that very small comfort zone - for the opportunity to be alone with yourself.  Good music and good headphones allow you to almost completely abstract from external inconvenience.  The stress level is about 3. <br><br><h5>  12:30  Stress level - 3 </h5><br>  And here is the other end of Moscow, the Otradnoye district.  Sometimes readings jump up to 4x.  I do not know what is affected exactly here.  Perhaps quite a fast paced walk, maybe something else.  Level 3-4 is considered to be within the normal range. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/b66/5f0/02f/b665f002f1a04895a32d33714da99792.jpg"><br><br>  Again, I will express my personal opinion, no offense to someone said, but some areas of our capital are very dull.  I do not want to say that they are bad, they can cause the brightest feelings to someone!  In the end, everything in this world depends only on our perception.  But I personally don‚Äôt like the architecture of such areas.  However, such external factors do not give rise to sadness or stress.  In the photo you can see the orange building of the business center, if I am not mistaken, then there is an office of my beloved company Parallels.  However, I need these green buildings of another business center.  This is the building where I worked several years ago and now decided to visit old colleagues and discuss possible participation in new projects. <br><br><h5>  13:00  Discussing work projects </h5><br>  In general, quite emotionally, in the process of discussion a bunch of ‚Äúinconsistencies‚Äù and disagreements occur.  However, the general mood is very calm.  In the end, it's just a job.  Being nervous about her is not productive.  Especially if we take into account the fact that the real activity on the project has not yet begun. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/8cf/9fc/a01/8cf9fca019ee483cb7754f6b3df816d9.jpg"><br><br>  Level of stress 3-4 in the process of talking.  And - yes, on the laptop screen - not the design and not even the prototype of some great startup.  Just one of the templates for Twitter Bootstrap, as a demonstration of the capabilities of modern web frameworks. <br><br><h5>  3:00 pm  I look into the server </h5><br>  Some wires are hanging, on the gateway server some rubbish is lying around, ah-ah-ah, in general. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/93f/2f8/808/93f2f88080f54e79a043fb96339beaca.jpg"><br><br>  And there are such temporary solutions. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/e43/fe2/a94/e43fe2a949404f3db4fac01d7866eab9.jpg"><br><br>  As is often the case, temporary servers become permanent.  On the other hand, this is not my area of ‚Äã‚Äãresponsibility, therefore I have nothing to worry about here :) <br><br>  According to the data, the stress level is 3-4, sometimes 5. Colleagues staged a small improvised banquet on the occasion of an extra day off and several days of employees' birthdays (it was February 20), so everyone‚Äôs mood is quite elevated.  Including me.  Perhaps because of this, the level rose to a value of 5. <br><br><h5>  18:00  Moscow metro again </h5><br>  You have to use it quite often, every day for several trips.  As already described above - it does not cause me any discomfort, rather the opposite.  For the sake of interest, I check the data on the device and notice that at some point the value rises from 4 to 7. According to the analysis of the data, then there are jumps from 2 to 7 for about half an hour, a little more. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/398/10f/228/39810f22826c4aa7b0f19910eb387c1c.jpg"><br><br>  What is completely incomprehensible to me, since the general condition has not changed much, the emotional background has changed a little.  I do not feel any anxiety, fear or discontent.  It may be affected by a small amount of alcohol in the blood after the ‚Äúbanquet‚Äù).  <i>Note</i>  <i>developer - it is in alcohol the whole thing!</i>  <i>This is not emotional, but physiological stress.</i>  <i>With early testing, it was unexpected to see that alcohol does not reduce, but almost always increases stress.</i> <br><br><h5>  18:40.  The transition from the ring to the radial branch </h5><br>  The end of the working day, everyone is in a hurry to go home.  The first time such a spectacle can shock, cause anger, denial and irritation, especially if you are in a hurry.  The main thing here is to reach the ‚Äúacceptance‚Äù stage very quickly, since you cannot change anything already.  It is advisable to be able to do this in a few seconds.  :) <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/355/051/952/3550519526444d45b978e4589d1ae130.jpg"><br><br>  Stress level - 4-5.  Saved so slightly elevated, the last hour - one and a half.  Perhaps an additional slight fatigue.  Overall, the condition is good.  I am heading for another job - quest network ‚ÄúClaustrophobia‚Äù.  Do not think for advertising, it's just really part of the job and part of my day.  Without showing this place the story would not be full, and to remove the name of the network in all the photos is quite problematic. <br><br><h5>  19:00 - 21:00 </h5><br>  I drove to the location of the quest to make sure that everything works correctly.  It runs a small server software of my production.  Recently, sometimes with a quest, small, subtle in the working conditions of the location, almost 24/7, bugs and errors occur.  Remotely catching such problems is extremely difficult, so sometimes you have to stop by.  On the other hand, everyone here is very friendly, you can always meet friends and, on the whole, a friendly atmosphere reigns. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/0b3/26b/d24/0b326bd24ac5453182ea60e13dedfded.jpg"><br><br>  Visitors are greeted by such a wall, covered with graphite paint, which allows you to draw on it with various crayons and easily erase the resulting inscriptions and drawings.  Visitors usually love to show their creativity. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/8a6/813/4e3/8a68134e34db4160ac06ed52d85f5fa7.jpg"><br><br>  Operator Lera monitors the game and helps players with puzzles. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/01d/489/c52/01d489c52ba049e3aba3fa1996bc33f2.jpg"><br><br>  This time I sit next to her and watch the game too, I see that everything is going right, the server is working, all the software is OK, all the hardware is OK, and at the right moment everything opens, closes, lights up, and the players have time leave the spacecraft before colliding with an asteroid. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/e54/771/257/e54771257956497692cd29720526acf1.jpg"><br><br>  Stress level 4-5.  Almost every time I enjoy visiting this place. <br><br>  21:30 on the clock.  It's time to go, give the device.  In Moscow, the main traffic jams ended, the main streams of people subsided in the subway and the city gradually acquires other colors.  Night lighting appears, and now the city emotionally looks completely different. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/52b/9a3/7dd/52b9a37dd9664286ab5294f68e9ee44b.jpg"><br><br>  The stress level is 3-5.  I already have no data for this period, but sometimes I glanced at the device.  Perhaps it affects fatigue, perhaps the emotional burden of meeting different people during the day, maybe something else.  Actually, after the device returns, the working hours at home are still waiting for me in silence, under the knocking of the keys of the laptop, but this will not be able to fix the device, as I had about a day for my testing. <br><br><h4>  Conclusion </h4><br>  In general - quite interesting sensations.  You can ask the question - why measure the level of stress, if your own emotional sensation is usually always understandable? <br><br>  First, it is not always possible to feel that you are really under stress.  Very often in some situations you catch yourself thinking that you are in a nervous, stressful state for quite a long time.  If this happens with a certain periodicity, then sooner or later it will begin to cause severe discomfort and health problems.  For example, most doctors agree that many gastrointestinal diseases, such as gastritis, are the result of constant excitement or stress.  As a confirmation, I can give an example from my own life, since this is a story from the first person.  Several years ago I was in the clinic with suspicions of gastritis.  After all the examinations and the discovery of some problems, the head manager of the gastroenterology department advised only one thing at discharge - stop nervous and change lifestyle (as a result).  And these tips helped.  If the device will give signals immediately upon the occurrence of certain levels of stress, this can help control it, if it occurs in your life. <br><br>  Secondly, even if you control yourself well, then with such a device you can take a more objective look at your own stress indicators, test yourself. <br><br>  I would like to give an analogy with the calculation of own costs.  We all consider our own money, expenses, incomes, we save somewhere, we plan somewhere, we build a budget, and so on.  However, many put special software for the accounting of own money and house accounting and more carefully approach to the analysis of expenses.  After all, when there is a complete picture of actions before your eyes, it is much easier to analyze something for yourself. <br><br>  Thank you very much for your attention! <br><br>  Respectfully, <br><br>  Petr Popov <br><br>  and the Darta Systems team. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/376963/">https://habr.com/ru/post/376963/</a></p>
