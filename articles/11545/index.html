And every time you have nothing to do, you look at people.  Each person is not like the other, everyone has different tastes and interests.  The one that doesn‚Äôt survive the minutes in big headphones without music, and the guy with the camera over his shoulder clearly loves to "take a picture", but the gentleman in a jacket cannot imagine life without fast Internet and office.  To the well-known saying that everything should be fine in a person, many react with the phrases ‚Äúthis does not happen‚Äù or ‚Äúthere are no ideal people in the world‚Äù.  Smartphones from the advanced N-series line also have a bias in one direction or another.  So it was before the appearance of the hero of the review. <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  On the new flagship of the Nokia N95, unlike people, you can really say - everything is fine in it.  This smartphone is like the girl or boyfriend of your dreams.  In life, the N95 would be the perfect partner for most.  He is serious and very smart, but not a nerd nerd, as in the evenings and on weekends he will be pleased with his musical abilities and love of entertainment.  And if you find yourself on a journey, show the shortest path and be able to shoot you near the Eiffel Tower, for example.  As stated in the advertisement, ‚ÄúI have one thing, or rather not one, there are a lot of it ...‚Äù.  Enough for every taste :)

      The most long-awaited smartphone of 2007, information about which appeared on the network at the end of 2006, we ruthlessly used a whole month.  Looking ahead, I note that ninety-fifth by 90% met expectations.  But I will tell in more detail below. <br><br>  So briefly.  Nokia N95 is a 3G smartphone with a unique case opening mechanism (double slider), having everything that was invented by mankind in the mobile phone field.  Fast Symbian S60 OS, 16 million colors screen, 5 megapixel camera, GPS, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, all possible office applications, fast Internet, separate music and video control keys, two external stereo speakers ... The list is very long.  All that made an impression on me for a month of operation, read on. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/olpictures/3de/2de/175/3de2de17571ec4faa1b5ba2cbdc8393c.jpg" width="385" height="550" hspace="10" vspace="10"><br><br>  Externally. <br><br>  If I didn‚Äôt know about the abilities of the Nokia N95, I would have passed by, considering it to be another product from the N-series.  Just a slider with just the usual look.  Such a gray box with decent dimensions (weight 120 grams and thickness 21 mm) in order to know the device status every day.  Maybe not a catchy look for the better: such an expensive toy will not attract suspicious eyes. <br><br>  The case materials are not easily soiled or slippery, the phone is securely fixed in the hand, especially in the open position.  For a month there were no situations where the N95 could fly out of hand. <br><br>  The unique mechanism of a double slider for a month was used by me only in one usual position with the screen shifting upwards.  This action itself, by the way, happens pleasantly with a light auto-guide.  Click click and in front of you is the second mini keyboard with four player control buttons.  As I wrote, its practical use is questionable.  In most cases, there are enough buttons available.  Such a mechanism is rather a Nokia ponte and a demonstration of extraordinary solutions.  But in the end, everyone decides for himself how to use his N95.  For a month, there was a slight backlash of this mechanism, which can be treated with understanding: the phone can transform almost into a coffee maker :) <br><br>  The creators didn‚Äôt leave a living place on the case either: Nokia N95 is stuffed with connectors of all stripes.  Reminds the back panel of some cool Hi-Fi system.  3.5mm input, TV-connector, mini-USB, IrDA, input for ‚Äúcharging‚Äù, microSD card slot.  It seems to have forgotten nothing.  Oh yes - two stereo speakers.  And that's not counting the side buttons.  Such an abundance of connectors is caused by the lack of a proprietary universal Nokia port, which is for the better. <br><br>  The keyboard, thanks to the large and convex buttons, is very convenient.  The course is optimally verified, there were almost no double-tapping cases on the neighbor.  In a hurry this is very helpful.  Five-way navigator also did not cause complaints.  As for the small keyboard, I will only add that the four buttons (play / pause, stop, fast forward and rewind) are combined into one block, have a small stroke and their own backlight (though not very even).  On the side, you will find the sound / zoom adjustment (when shooting), as well as two buttons for working with the camera. <br><br>  As a result, the Nokia N95 month passed as it should be for such a device.  The paint has not faded, the details have not fallen off (except for the play of the slider mechanism), and the N95 did not show a tendency to micro-scratches (this happens when wearing a mobile phone without a cover in your pocket).  ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not handsome, but smarter than all my peers‚Äù - probably, this would be what I would say to myself, as they like to call all N-series in Nokia, a mobile computer, if I could speak.  Read about the richest filling of smarttop. <br>  Inside <br><br>  The traditional power button on top shows the gorgeous device screen.  Nokia N95 is equipped with a 2.6-inch TFT-display QVGA (240 √ó 320 pixels) with a light sensor that displays up to 16 million colors.  Already by dry numbers we can say that the screen is excellent.  In practice, everything was confirmed.  After reviewing for 1 month on this display a lot of pictures, websites, videos and photos with confidence I state - this is the best screen for today among all Nokia phones, and he will also knock out many other phones of this company on this item.  In the heat, in the sun, you will not have problems with image readability - anti-glare copes perfectly.  By the way, he has no protective glass, which makes the picture even brighter, but the screen itself is more vulnerable.  Hints at the imminent appearance of touchscreen smartphones?  It‚Äôs time already, and with the appearance on June 29 of the Apple iPhone, the ninety-fifth will not be so sweet. <br><br>  The menu and firmware have already been tried on the N93i cameraphone.  Well, in general - this is a well-tested Symbian S60 3rd Edition, modified in accordance with the flagship.  And let them say that all Symbianovskie smarts brakes in life.  This is not about the N95.  In practice, it has become much faster than all previous smartphones (who cares, here stands the most powerful processor of all the N-series - 330Mhz).  The menu runs fast, files open without delay, and in the gallery, the conversion of icons into pictures also happens faster.  And what is most pleased, the trend of speed will be applied in all subsequent smartphones of the company.  The long-awaited progress on the face. <br><br>  The second problem of smart phones is ‚Äúglitches‚Äù.  I will not hide, for a month they were.  All devices from the first batch will be just that.  To save yourself from such troubles, you can absolutely officially, from the site Nokia reflash the "mobile" from version 10 to 11th.  I did just that, and the ‚Äúglitches‚Äù disappeared, and those that remained you would not notice at all.  Nice innovation.  When you open the device in player mode (small keyboard), an animated menu of multimedia functions appears.  By the way, the device can work both in vertical and horizontal orientation, which is convenient when browsing websites or reading office files. <br><br>  As for any useful applications, the N95 is just a collection of all possible functions from all N-series smartphones.  The menu is just bursting with various icons. <br><br>  Such a monster can not be imagined without an impressive amount of memory.  N95 is endowed with internal memory of 160MB, and also has a slot for microSD memory cards, where you can stick a USB flash drive up to 4GB.  Take at least 2GB if you use the device to the fullest. <br><br>  I don‚Äôt even want to talk about basic functions: I just have everything.  I note, finally, a normal alarm clock (now there are several of them, as it should be), but a calculator for a first grader.  They would not be lazy, but looked to the guys who made the Nokia 5300, that there is real engineering in it.  However, the Internet will find a bunch of different calculators for every taste. <br><br>  One of the main features of this clever is the camera.  One of its kind already commands respect.  And the characteristics add intrigue.  Here is a lens with branded Carl Zeiss lenses (Vario-Tessar) at 5 megapixels (2592 √ó 1944 pixels).  There is an autofocus, an electronic stabilizer, a built-in flash and a 20-fold, but only a digital zoom, from the use of which it is better to refrain.  Amateur photographers will appreciate the abundance of shooting modes and the ability to adjust the main indicators.  As soon as you open the mechanical shutter that protects the lens (by the way!), The camera will turn on automatically, and the backlight of the side keys will immediately light up.  The whole process of shooting will bring you only pleasant emotions. <br><br>  The main question is the quality of the images.  After all, today only N95 has 5 megapixels.  I took off during the month different pictures in different conditions.  As he did not try, the photos did not pull on this permission.  I can safely say that the eloquent inscription 5 megapixel is just a lure for the buyer.  God forbid, the quality of 3.2 megapixels will pull, but not by 5. The difference, for example, from the camera Nokia N73 is minimal.  There were rumors that early prototypes were shot much better, but supposedly Nokia deliberately squeezed the camera.  What for?  Maybe to bring down so not a low price?  We already will not know the answer.  Some of the pictures posted in the photo gallery. <br><br>  But the video N95 shoots perfectly.  The recording is done at 30 frames / s, and the resolution is 640 √ó 480 pixels.  Like the cameraphone N93.  And the sound is written in stereo!  Video file formats: .mp4 (not to be confused with DiVX!) Or 3gp.  If you know what a video is, filmed on N93, then you will understand.  And if not, then take a mediocre video camera - the quality is comparable, both in image and sound.  True files are huge, but worth it.  For a month was a couple of times in the club.  Even in extreme lighting conditions, everything is seen very well, and the sound is transmitted as if you are still at a party, especially the bass. <br><br>  The built-in music player will also help you remember the fun moments of the night.  For music, the N95 has a separate keyboard, a 3.5mm input, and two external stereo speakers.  The menu is pretty standard and convenient.  There is an equalizer with a large set of adjustments, as well as a function of 3D sound.  Of course, two dynamics - this is a plus, obviously speaking about the musical orientation of the apparatus.  They are quite loud, but not record-breakers at maximum speed.  But the bell is heard perfectly, and most importantly loudly. <br><br>  To assess the sound quality, there was plenty of time.  Listened to all styles and directions.  In the end - the sound of a good four.  I admit, in my heart I was hoping to hear the sound as in the N91.  Compared with this musical guru with brains from the famous brand of audio equipment "Harman Kardon" he can not.  For not very picky about the quality - N95 just right.  In the metro, with standard headphones, everything is clearly audible at 70% volume.  There is a good FM radio, but again without the RDS function. <br>  About GPS separately. <br><br>  For the first time, a built-in GPS receiver was used in the Nokia smartphone.  This has become one of the main features of the device.  The thing is, of course, convenient, but still here it is not implemented at 100%.  This applies to the absence on the maps of houses with numbers.  Those.  The use of GPS is reduced only to the possibilities of finding the nearest metro, cafe, cinema or to understand which street you are on in order to find the shortest way to the desired point.  For those who have not used such a system before, it will cause puppy enthusiasm and surprise, especially in the early days.  You can surprise your friends with a fascinating action with the view of our planet from space, which then comes close to the point of your actual location.  Recalls an excerpt from the movie "Enemy of the State" with Will Smith in the title role :) <br><br>  For GPS there are several applications.  The main thing is "Maps".  Here actually your location is shown, and also it is just possible to find the interesting address.  The map of Russia (together with Moscow) takes 86Mb.  There are other countries whose maps can be found on the Nokia website.  There is also a compass showing where to go to the cardinal points via satellites.  This application measures the distance traveled, walking / driving speed, etc. <br><br>  Satellite navigation is not a stable thing.  Sometimes walls, windows and even clouds interfere with it.  In the first times, connections to satellites will be held with varying success, as lucky.  The smartphone will choose the most optimal transmitters.  To search for them will take more than one hour, or even a day!  It happened to me.  But for a month, I still felt the beauty of GPS, especially in the car and the countryside, where it is very important not to get lost.  A toy is what you need.  We are waiting for the autumn of the appearance of maps with the designation of houses. <br><br>  The king of communications is the Nokia N95.  Perhaps, only communication with the international space station and with other galaxies is absent :) This device works in the WCDMA HSDPA 2100 and EGSM850 / 900/1800/1900 networks.  Moreover, the standard for connecting to the Internet HSDPA provides a speed of 3 times higher than 3G!  The device with a reserve for the future.  In Russia, only the video link starts, and here it is.  You can also access the network using Wi-Fi, the benefit of access points is growing (cafes, cinemas, shopping centers, etc.).  By the way, it is planned to place transmitters in the metro, within the ring.  But when it will be - it is not known for sure.  On the N95, this thing works fine.  The maximum noted speed per month is 1.5 Mbit / s.  in the cafe. <br><br>  Excellent screen, its horizontal orientation, fast access speed - what else is needed to climb on the Internet perfectly :) The whole world is in your pocket.  Talking for a long time about the fact that there is Bluetooth, antediluvny infrared, USB connection does not make sense, so much in the coolest smartphones without them.  The phone provides all sorts of things, such as creating your on-line blog directly from the N95 and other wireless chips.  Maybe someone will be interested.  The connection is excellent, without fail.  The interlocutor on the other end of the wire can be heard without interference. <br><br>  If not a car battery, then what can ensure the functioning of all the functions of the sophisticated device? :) Nokia thought that the BL-5F battery (950 mAh) would suffice.  During the month, the phone behaved differently.  In the first days I was a little shocked that the charge lasted half a day!  But after two weeks, the battery got stuck up to one day, which in principle is expected with such a heavy load of functions and a huge screen. <br>  Total. <br><br>  Four weeks is a good time to evaluate all sides of this flagship.  Within a month, the Nokia N95 delivered only positive impressions.  I did not find any noticeable minuses at all.  Worth thing!  The only possible aspect against the N95 is consumers choosing touch controls, i.e.  communicators.  But, according to the creators, the cool smartphone is designed for a different audience.  And their number is sufficient to ensure stable demand for the Finnish mobile computer.  Without exaggeration, Nokia N95 proved with deed that today it has the best smartphone in the world and it has very few competitors.  Fast, functional, original, able to satisfy the desires of any very picky buyer.  Phone without compromise, created for the same uncompromising people who want to have everything in their pockets at once.  So if you have extra 40,000 rubles in your pocket (this is the official price for today), feel free to go to the nearest communications salon for the uncrowned king of smartphones. <br><br>  Pros (+): <br>  original form factor <br>  great screen <br>  the richest functionality, <br>  GPS receiver <br>  speed of work. <br>  Minuses (-): <br>  The camera does not pull on 5 megapixels. <br><br>  <a href="http://www.indarnb.ru/hi-tech/%3Fid%3DF7EAA22111F5EC14">Original article + video + photo</a> <br>  <a href="http://www.nokia.ru/A4374213">Specifications</a> <br><br>  ZY  He cited the article completely because many people do not like to follow the links, and it is interesting too.
