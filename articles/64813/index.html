      - Hello, Yandex.Money!  I want to know what happened to the account number 000000000000? <br><br>  - Your account is blocked and will be closed within 10 days. <br><br>  - Can I find out what happened?  After all, six months ago we fulfilled all your requirements, passed authorization, there are no conflict situations on the account ... <br><br>  - (in a puffy voice) No, you can't.  We are not obliged to give you such information and in general any explanations.  If closed, it means that there are grounds ... <br><br>  The last story of blocking our Yandex.Money account received yesterday-today an unexpected <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  ... the beginning: " <a href="http://futbolkin-blog.livejournal.com/73491.html">Yandex.Money: love in Russian</a> " and " <a href="http://futbolkin-blog.livejournal.com/73770.html">Yandex.Money: love-in Russian (2)</a> " ... <br><br>  I go, Znachitstsa, in the online exchanger to withdraw the hard-earned money to his wife on a pin, his daughter on a new racket.  I submit an application, everything seems to be as usual ... and then a message flies out: "The movement of funds in the specified direction is prohibited."  This means that Yandex.Money (PO) blocked the account. <br><br>  I wonder: six months ago the poison already blocked our account.  Then we fulfilled all their requirements (authorization of an account for a Russian resident, provision of passport data, etc.), and the account was successfully opened. <br><br>  There are no conflict situations in the account either. <br><br>  I am writing in support of the request, what happened.  I get the answer: <br><br>  - ... Consumer operations are suspended in order to identify the owner of the Wallet. <br><br>  In order for the account transactions on your account to be resolved again, you need to submit an application in accordance with clause 4.6.2.3 of this Agreement according to the attached sample ... <br>  - Chu, I think, sho for garbage.  We already passed it.  I am writing further: <br><br>  - Dear ... <br><br>  Probably, I do not understand something, but we have already passed through this procedure. <br><br>  Our account 0000000000000 is identified in the name of my business partner from St. Petersburg <br><br>  It was at the end of December 2008.  Our account was blocked, my partner submitted an application and all necessary documents to the St. Petersburg office of Yandex. Money, and after some time the account was unblocked. <br><br>  Please clarify: is this some kind of error or should we go through some other ADDITIONAL identification ??? <br>  - In response - like a bolt from the blue: <br><br>  - According to clause 9.2.1 of the ‚ÄúAgreement on the use of the Yandex.Money System‚Äù, the agreement may be terminated at the initiative of the user and / or the System Operator at any time. <br><br>  The initiator of the termination of the contract shall send the appropriate notice to the other party.  The contract is considered to be terminated ten days after the receipt of the said notice. <br><br>  Based on the foregoing, Yandex.Money Substation LLC reports that after ten days from the date of receipt of this notice, the Agreement on the use of the Yandex.Money System is deemed terminated and the virtual account you use 000000000000000 will be closed by the System Operator. <br>  - This letter surprised me unpleasantly - I will not hide it.  But no more than that: firstly, something about 16 thousand rubles (about 500 bucks) is hanging on the account - the amount is rather big, but at the moment it is completely uncritical.  Secondly, my third day hellish tooth hurts, and compared to this the blocking of the account at the POISON is heavenly apples, believe me. <br><br>  But the following conversation on the phone just killed me: <br><br>  - - Hello, Yandex.Money!  I want to know what happened to the account number 000000000000? <br><br>  - Your account is blocked and will be closed within 10 days. <br><br>  - Can I find out what happened?  After all, six months ago we fulfilled all your requirements, passed authorization, there are no conflict situations on the account ... <br><br>  - (in a puffy voice) No, you can't.  We are not obliged to give you such information and in general any explanations.  If closed, it means that there are grounds ... <br>  - I, of course, heard different reviews about Yandex in general and Yandex.Money in particular.  I myself was outraged and displeased with him - in the first part of our ‚Äúseries‚Äù.  But then I was at least given an explanation (and, by the way, afterwards - ways to solve the situation). <br><br>  Today, Yandex.Money simply blocked the account, without even bothering with explanations.  What, the crisis hit so hard?  Can it really be that the money is needed so that their selection will be carried out ‚Äúpure and chaotic‚Äù? <br><br>  PS It's not even a shame.  And the fact that there was an idea was a preliminary conversation with Sergey Petrenko from Yandex.Ukraine about how to make a joint project of ProstoPrint.com and one of the Yandex services.  A good project would be interesting.  But - alas, does not take place. <br><br>  Because we are not "observers in a war where ours are killed."  (c) One good person <br><br>  And money - yes figs with them, with money. <br>  - ps  blog is not mine.  Just became interesting, as it is called. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/64813/">https://habr.com/ru/post/64813/</a></p>
