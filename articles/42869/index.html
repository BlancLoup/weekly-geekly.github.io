  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Using online tools from Google</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Today, there are many online services that provide interesting opportunities.  I want to tell you about the use of one of them (GoogleDocs SpreadSheets) in our company.  The interest of this article is that this is <b>not just a description, as ‚Äúit would be cool‚Äù, but about real implementation.</b> <b><br></b> <br>  The implementation I want to talk about is the online sales chart in Google Docs platform. <br><br>  The specifics of the work of our sales department is that: <br><ul><li>  we hold many presentations throughout Moscow; </li><li>  we work mainly with students with a constantly changing schedule; </li><li>  managers are divided into three groups; </li><li>  the work of managers is regulated by two coordinators and the head of the sales department and the deputy. </li></ul><br>  The main task that we decided to use an online table with a schedule, operational management of the schedule of the department and operational reporting. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  The graph itself is a spreadsheet (a la Excel) on the GoogleDocs platform.  For those who have never used it, it seems like Excel, only in your browser and access to the file can get someone who has access.

      In our file, a separate sheet is selected for each month and this month looks like this: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/5d2/9a9/bc0/5d29a9bc0607ac4578a1ab3bf0277841.png" alt="1224592175-clip-21kb.png"><br><br>  In the left column are the names of managers, then the columns go all the days of the month, where managers make their schedule. <br><br>  After the managers have made their schedule - the coordinator of the department starts working, which distributes the meetings between the managers and sets their status after the meeting passes: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/e75/eb6/610/e75eb661086ece098994c67f34670a3e.png" alt="1224595225-clip-8kb.png"><br><br>  By the end of the month or on any of its days, we can sum up the results and effectiveness: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/b91/ec9/bd7/b91ec9bd76edf82f1d9359c6e4774100.png" alt="1224592565-clip-7kb.png"><br><br>  It turned out that writing formulas in Google SpreadSheets is more difficult, nezhli I used to in my favorite Excel. <br>  Firstly, it contains formulas in English and their names in 30% do not coincide with the English name Excel.  Secondly, there are not all Excel formulas there, and sometimes it was necessary to excel, for example: <br> <code>=CONCATENATE(IF(INDIRECT(ADDRESS($F11;U$4;1;1;$C$3))="";DAY(INDIRECT(ADDRESS(3;U$4+3;1;1;$C$3)));"-"). (  28       :)..=IF(INDIRECT(ADDRESS($F11;BA$4;1;1;$C$3))="";DAY(INDIRECT(ADDRESS(3;BA$4+3;1;1;$C$3)));"-"))</code> <br> <br>  Based on these statistics, we can quickly respond to changes in the efficiency of holding meetings or reducing the workload of a particular manager. <br><br>  The most convenient in this implementation is that every employee who uses this schedule can fill it from home, from the office, from an Internet cafe.  This is extremely important for us, because  Our managers are mostly students who appear in the office several times a week and their schedule changes every two to three days. <br><br>  Another feature of our company is that some of the employees work in Linux Ubuntu, so the cross-platform solutions from Google (it can work on Win, Linux, MacOS) were only to our advantage. <br><br>  The only disadvantage that we are deciding for now is the regulation, and not technically, the absence of restrictions on filling certain cells, i.e.  the manager cannot be prohibited from changing the cells that the coordinator or the head of the department fills in.  But here we are saved by notifications that Google kindly sends every time there are changes in the cells that are important to me. <br><br>  For those who want to gain access to read the file - write me on gumoza (gav-gav) gmail.com </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/42869/">https://habr.com/ru/post/42869/</a></p>
