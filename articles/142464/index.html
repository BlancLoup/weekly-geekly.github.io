Every qualified professional today is an almost independent combat unit, a ‚Äúmini-startup‚Äù independently deciding who and how best to sell his services, and how to optimize his performance. <br><br>  As with any startup, for an IT-specialist it is important not only the excellent quality of the product or service provided, but also the ability to show themselves and draw attention to themselves.  And also - the ability to soberly assess their strengths and weaknesses, to match them with the needs of the market and to maneuver in time, sometimes even to start everything from scratch.  A musician and sound engineer, inspired by the Internet boom of the late 90s, starts making websites and eventually creates CodeIgniter.  The sysadmin gets tired of the Apache patch and writes Nginx from scratch.  C-programmer decides to use JavaScript to bind his workings out into event-oriented network applications and creates Node.js.  There are many such examples. <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  Being engaged in recruiting for many years, we have accumulated a wide experience of personnel evaluation, and we are ready to share this experience not only with employers, but also with the IT specialists themselves.  Today, <a href="http://www.luxoft-personnel.ru/">Luxoft Personnel</a> together with the training center Luxoft Training announces the launch of a career consulting project <a href="http://www.luxoft-personnel.ru/services/maximum/">‚ÄúMaximum‚Äù</a> .  Now anyone can contact us and get an expert assessment of their knowledge, skills and personal qualities and make an optimal plan for professional growth.

      We are one of the first in the CIS to offer this service as a full-fledged independent product, separate from employment or recruitment. <br><br>  How it works?  First, you will receive a technical interview to determine the professional level of the client, which is carried out by experts in relevant areas - Luxoft professionals and <a href="http://www.luxoft-training.ru/">Luxoft Training</a> practicing trainers.  Then - deep psychological testing and analysis of personal qualities.  This is often forgotten, but it happens that it is precisely the lack of social skills or <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/digitaloctober/blog/142203/">‚Äúemotional intelligence‚Äù that</a> prevents a technically excellent technician from fully realizing his or her capabilities. <br><br>  After going through all the stages of the interview and testing, you receive a detailed report containing an individual assessment of your professional qualities and prospects for your growth.  We not only evaluate, but also give a lot of practical recommendations, in accordance with your goals.  For example, if you want to find a new job, we can advise how to improve your resume, how to prepare and pass the interview.  We give an estimate of the salary range and a list of companies that may be of interest to you as a possible future place of work. <br><br>  If you are more interested in career or professional growth within the company, then in your recommendations we will elaborate on what personal and professional qualities you need to develop, identify your ‚Äúgrowth points‚Äù and draw up a plan of classes and trainings that Luxoft training center can offer Training, we give literature lists for self-study. <br><br>  On the one hand, career consulting is a new and unusual service on the labor market.  On the other hand, practically the same packages of tests and recommendations that have been successfully and successfully ordered by managers and owners of companies for their employees, and this pays off and gives real returns.  The only difference is that when personnel assessment is done at the initiative of the company, the recommendations of the recruitment agency take into account, first of all, the interests and goals of the employer, and not the employees being assessed.  And when you buy a similar service for yourself, the focus of your interests and goals is the growth of your income, your professional level and the pleasure of working. <br><br>  It takes about a week to complete the process from applying to receiving a package of detailed recommendations.  All interviews are held in the form of a personal meeting in our offices in Moscow and Kiev. <br><br>  The cost of the service is from $ 600 to $ 1,500, depending on the set of services in the package of services, which is determined by your goals of seeking advice. <br><br>  To order a service - <a href="http://www.luxoft-personnel.ru/services/maximum/">fill out the form</a> on our website or write to one of the managers in these cities. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/142464/">https://habr.com/ru/post/142464/</a></p>
