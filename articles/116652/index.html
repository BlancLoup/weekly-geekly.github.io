  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Spring update, part 2 "Program of Encouragement of Authors"</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Following the <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/announcements/115700/">first part of the spring update,</a> it's time to announce the second.  So, today we are pleased to announce the launch of PPA - Authors Promotion Program. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h4>  What is the PPA? </h4><br>  As you know, all the blogs on the site are divided into two large groups - corporate and thematic.  In the first they write only companies, in the second - only users. <br><br>  Now some of the thematic blogs stand out among other special icon.  Such blogs are considered to be specialized and 100% relevant to the site.  The posts published in profile blogs will be encouraged not only by the attention of readers, but also by a ruble, provided that the author participates in the Promotion Program. <br><br>  The link to the PPA is available to all registered users and is located next to the nickname on the left in the header of the site.  In the same area displays the state of balance.

        <ins class="adsbygoogle"
          style="display:block; text-align:center;"
          data-ad-layout="in-article"
          data-ad-format="fluid"
          data-ad-client="ca-pub-6974184241884155"

        </script>
      <br>
    <h4>  Who can participate in PPA? </h4><br>  Users with the following icons: "Author", "Star", "Legend" and "Old-Timer".  Users who have at least one of these icons can participate in the PPA.  Every new UFO participant credits 1000 rubles to the account. <br><br>  Owners of other icons (“Commentator”, “Translator”, “Podkaster”, “Humorist”, “Troll”) do not participate in PPA.  For more information about the system of icons you can find in the <a href="http://www.habrahabr.ru/info/help/badgets/">corresponding section of the</a> site's help. <br><br><h4>  What posts will be encouraged? </h4><br>  Blog posts are of the following types - “Post”, “Translation”, “Link”, “Survey”, “Podcast”, “Event”, “Vacancy” and “Voice”.  In PAP, only “Posts” and “Translations” are encouraged - other types of entries do not participate in the program. <br><br>  If the post in the profile blog following a vote scores a rating of 50 points, then 500 rubles will be credited to the user's account.  For each rating unit over those 50 points, the user gets another one ruble.  That is, if the post rating after the end of a vote was 170 points, 620 rubles are credited to the user’s account (500 rubles for 50 rating points and 120 rubles for 120 points from above). <br><br>  Only 50% of the total amount is paid for posts of the “Transfer” category, that is, if the “transfer” earned 170 rating points, the author will be credited with 310 rubles (620/2). <br><br>  Money to the user's account is not recorded immediately, but only after the expiration of the vote for the post - now it is three days.  As soon as this period passes, on the “Balance” page the user displays the name of the post, the final score and the amount of money earned for it.  The total balance is displayed next to it - the entire amount of money earned by users for posts in specialized blogs. <br><br><h4>  How to get the earned money? </h4><br>  The minimum amount for withdrawal is 3,000 rubles.  All user money will be accumulated on the account until it activates the “Automatic Withdrawal” setting. <br><br>  Money is withdrawn automatically no more than once a month, at the end of the calendar month and no later than the 15th day of the month following the reporting month.  That is, if you start writing articles in profile blogs in early January, then the first cream can be removed somewhere from February 1 to February <nobr>15</nobr> , provided that in January at least the minimum amount for withdrawal was earned.  Well, so on. <br><br>  All money is withdrawn to the account in the <a href="http://money.yandex.ru/">Yandex.Money</a> system.  Before withdrawing funds, the user must pass an identity check and send us some personal information about himself so that the accounting department can process all transactions in accordance with the legislation in force in the Russian Federation and pay ALL taxes. <br><br><h4>  What will happen to the posts of PAP participants? </h4><br>  According to PPA rules, all posts of the program participants are distributed under the <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/">Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 Unported license (CC BY 3.0)</a> .  This type of license allows others to freely distribute, process, correct and develop the work, even for commercial purposes, provided that the author of the work is indicated. <br><br><h4>  What else? </h4><br>  Just the other day at <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/users/boomburum/" class="user_link">boomburum</a> ended the trial period.  In this regard, we are pleased to introduce Alexei as a new project manager and wish him every success.  We decided to continue the tradition that was interrupted by <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/users/mio/" class="user_link">mio</a> and invited a user to this position, who managed to pump himself up to <nobr>the 1st</nobr> position and stay on it for a long time. <br><br><h4>  It's all? </h4><br>  No, not all.  In the coming days, we plan to make changes in the ranking of users, blogs and companies.  In this regard, please do not be afraid and treat with understanding - changes are needed in connection with the latest updates in the engine of the site. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/116652/">https://habr.com/ru/post/116652/</a></p>
