Kalashnikov </blockquote><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/909/3e2/de8/9093e2de88a444429f8a619f12970548.jpg"><br><p><br>  In the <a href="https://geektimes.ru/post/280952/">first part,</a> we began to consider the system of the voracious Monkey and Cheater Palm with energetically valuable Bananas, figured out the degree of gluttony, identified the Need, and settled on the Control Mechanism that encourages collecting more food than Monkeys are going to eat in Monkey (I wondered, if this mind tells not to overeat), thereby balancing the Flows of Energy. </p><a name="habracut"></a><br><p>  Here and below, Special Concepts are written with a capital letter for greater importance and difference from simple words that can be used for explanation and examples. </p><br><h2>  About needs </h2><br><p>  Strictly speaking, the need of a separate Monkey is satisfied even with the help of efficiency of 100%, when it eats as much as it needs every day.  But every single monkey is an animal, it grows old and dies.  And the Monkey population remains in time, which means that the Monkey has an additional, improved Need not only to eat itself, but also to have at least one descendant, for this you need to make friends with the Neighbor. </p><br><p>  By the way, for the sustainable survival of a species with sexual reproduction, two descendants are needed, for the same species with developed care for the elderly, there are already three children.  And what happens if at some point is not reproducible, you can see it under the spoiler. </p><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">picture with primates</b> <div class="spoiler_text"><p>  A schematic diagram of the life of several generations of bisexual upright-eater primates, whose grandchildren wanted to live for themselves, like humans. <img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/bf3/031/9d0/bf30319d06fe435184301d7bba3effe7.jpg"></p></div></div><br><p>  For a descendant, additional 100% of bananas are needed, for a nursing mother for a period, you also need to give out more bananas, while the second half also works on a palm tree and with its additional 100% feeds the second little monkey. </p><br><p>  Even if we eliminate the dangers at every step, the conclusion is the same: the need for bananas is growing.  But in principle, <b>these 200% are limited to the Biological Needs of the monkey</b> , in the conditions of the Paradise Palm there is nothing more necessary.  The whole essence and purpose of life of the Monkey lies in these needs. </p><br><h2>  Control Mechanism (TM) </h2><br><p>  The fact that Biological Needs is a direct guarantee of the survival of a species imposes a serious responsibility on each capable individual.  The brutal need to go and collect bananas every day for no less than 5000 kcal.  No exceptions.  You will not be able to save on yourself, the forces will be weak, you will not be able to save on children, you will not be able to save on your wife.  And then the old parents began to live longer than usual.  You think about it ... And there is something to think about. <img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/94f/d43/13f/94fd4313fcb7456a8c51b2b1ad7de787.jpg" align="right"></p><br><p>  At some point, our Monkey hero realizes that the daily balance of bananas and effort is directly related.  It becomes clear that it is impossible to have fun all day in the clearing, because fatigue from fun is the same as from picking bananas, but bananas are not increasing from fun.  That is, the daily goal of collecting bananas is not fulfilled.  Fun is inappropriate. </p><br><p>  And here, the UM assumes not only the function of controlling energy consumption, but also the control of energy expenditure.  There are some rules of appropriate behavior: the number of bananas collected over time should not decrease, you can not spend on collecting more energy than you can fill, you can not collect the necessary bananas for too long.  All this gives a fundamental law of expediency: the <b>ratio of the result of work to the cost of energy for work does not decrease with the passage of time</b> . </p><br><h2>  Algorithm to ensure expediency </h2><br><p>  As already mentioned, the UM has the ability to learn in various ways.  In this case, specific methods do not matter (you can think of it as finding a local minimum). </p><br><p>  At some point in the UM a final algorithm is formed to ensure the expediency of the operation of the primate body: </p><br><ul><li>  Remember the sequence of costly actions (for example, the path to the Palm, intercepting vines, well, or, fun on the meadow) </li><li>  Calculate the total cost of these actions. </li><li>  Remember the sequence of useful actions that can be done after receiving the Result (he ate himself, fed the children, drove off the enemy) </li><li>  Calculate the total value of the result of these actions (children sleep, the female loves) </li><li>  Calculate Result / Cost Ratio </li><li>  Divide the Attitude by Time from the Start of the Costs to the Full Result Obtaining a Quantitative Expression of the Degree of Feasibility <br>  <i>and the most important</i> </li><li>  Compare the obtained result with the previous assessment of the Feasibility and in the case when the current result exceeds the previous ones - take the new sequence of cost actions as optimal, otherwise remember these actions as Inappropriate. </li></ul><br><p>  Such an algorithm at the most abstract level ensures the long-term survival of the species <i>while maintaining the</i> tendency to expand its habitat. </p><br><h2>  First Labor </h2><br><p>  Every time, waking up in the morning, the Monkeys understand - something must be done.  But what?  Consider the simplest action - get up from the grass on its feet.  The monkey is large, for simplicity, imagine that the Monkey lifts its own weight of 75 kg.  1 meter to get up.  At the same time, the work of the muscles is performed, the internal energy of the body is consumed, the whole process takes some time.  Time depends on the total muscle power, and energy consumption for useful work will be accompanied by the release of heat. </p><br><p>  It is easy to see that in the above example, the internal energy of the Monkey was spent on a useful thing, get up on his feet, and then go to Palma.  They do not go lying (in the army they go, but this is a separate story).  So you have to get up. </p><br><p>  The work was done with the aim of collecting bananas, which means that the energy expended is already included in the total Costs of banana production.  The fact that <b>there is no such Monkey action that can occur without the cost of internal energy</b> is the basis for the entire physical economy system.  The flow of energy from the monkey, dissipating in the form of heat or turning into an impact on nature, embodied in bananas, is inevitable.  Even the work of the UM leads to the loss of stored energy in order to then indirectly turn into tasty bananas. </p><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/44b/148/61d/44b14861d9a74f7fa58b85d74de801a9.JPG" align="left" width="50%"><br><p>  But let us ask the question: Is there anyone who needs this perfect work?  Of course have.  This is Primate himself, and his family.  That is, this work was done to meet the needs (i.e., i.e.) and Needs.  So <b>this job is Labor</b> . </p><br><p>  Get up from the <s>couch</s> grass - it's work!  Any work is a banana, but not every banana is work.  Good morning, Paradise! </p><br><h2>  First Tool </h2><br><p>  It is easy to understand that the Expediency algorithm will use every opportunity to optimize and minimize the balance of Energy Flows and make the most complete use of the capabilities of the monkey's body.  In this sense, UM is a rational mechanism.  But nature is often irrational, and a rational solution can get stuck in a local optimum without going to a qualitatively new level of benefit. </p><br><p>  Therefore, the DM, in addition to the expediency algorithm, quickly realized that the use of the nonlinearity of nature can also be useful.  This gives primacy some unpredictability, allows it to do arbitrary, random things.  And that's where it led. </p><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/85a/521/f0b/85a521f0b8554e069bc4e1dcd03572e1.jpg" align="right"><br><p>  Monkeys every day lifts its weight to a height of 10 meters.  The most optimal paw movements have already been found, the shortest paths along the trunk and lianas have been tried.  But the optimization limit has been reached.  And so, at some point, tired but pleased, Primate takes home a bunch of bananas and stumbles upon a familiar path on a dry branch.  It is light, long and durable. </p><br><p>  Primate puts a bunch of bananas on the ground to remove the obstacle, grabs the stick, touches the bundle and raises it without effort due to the lever.  The MIND cannot fail to take advantage of this moment, and immediately calculates the energy benefits of an easier way home with this ... Instrument. </p><br><p>  There is a great turning point.  Primate takes something from nature and uses it not as food, but as a means of obtaining / transporting food.  In the following days, Monkeys find a stick with hundreds of applications, which increases the efficiency of banana production and, most importantly, increases its capabilities.  With a stick, the primate can do more than without it.  You can knock bananas, even shoot down the whole day, get tired less.  It seems, it is time to <s>talk to</s> moan with the female about the third child. </p><br><h2>  Second Tool </h2><br><p>  The tool (instrument of labor) expands the technical capabilities of the monkey, strengthens it, adds its coefficient to the formula of Work, and although the efficiency of any tool is less than one, strengthening the capabilities of the monkey allows you to drastically increase the efficiency of the entire system. </p><br><p> But at this stage, the monkey still takes something from nature and directly uses it in work.  Sticks, stones.  But at some point, the UM demonstrates one more skill - combinatorial abilities.  A stick in one hand, a stone in the other.  Tyts-tyts, a stick appeared at the stick.  You can stick a stick in the ground, hang bananas on it and the children will not get them, you can not go for bananas tomorrow (in fact, you cannot but walk). </p><br><p>  Let me remind you that all inventions of the UM have a positive effect on the efficiency of the system.  So, they make their own amendments to the Expediency algorithm.  Regular combinatorial exercises with sticks and stones eventually take up more and more in the cost chain, as this gives an even greater increase in results.  The capabilities of the Monkey‚Äôs body do not grow much, but the tools can be combinatorially developed to infinity. </p><br><p>  This turns an experiment in tool development from experiment into Need.  This is a completely new, non-biological need.  You can say this is the second most important event in the history of monkeys - the emergence of non-monkey needs.  She can not be satisfied with nature.  Now, <b>any work that is capable of ensuring that the Expediency function does not decrease is obliged to include work on tools</b> . </p><br><p>  Here we stop, leaving the Monkey for his new combinatorial entertainment. </p><br><h2>  PS They write to us </h2><br><p>  H.  Commentators asked a number of questions, for example, <i>am I going to write the Matrix?</i> <br>  Answer: I would like to, but this is a dubious undertaking. </p><br><p>  Or, <i>aren't I taking a lot when modeling the complex non-linear behavior of a monkey?</i> <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/44a/7e3/490/44a7e34903f74fa6a4ab46416fc187a6.jpg" align="right" width="40%">  Well, here you can argue for a long time how it (the behavior) is non-linear, in its mass and according to statistics, but I will answer within the framework of the system under consideration - for a system that serves to calculate the energy exchange of Primate with Nature, all the behavior of the monkey, all its grimaces, jumps on the head it seems only from the point of view of sensors and software in the fitness bracelet: "Kcal spent per day: 2500". </p><br><p>  For this, in fact, they build abstract models: they stick out the analyzed properties, exclude non-significant properties.  Nonlinearity can be taken into account as a factor, but for this, definition is sufficient. </p><br><p>  Of course, one can argue what are the significant and insignificant properties of the model, and there are comments for this. </p><br><p>  To be continued... </p></div>
