As the main vector of development, ASUS chooses technological innovations.  Including releases very interesting hybrids and the continuation of the tradition was the release of VivoTab RT. <br><br>  In the ‚Äútablet building‚Äù, as it was recently with smartphones, there is a fierce fight: a race of cores, screen resolutions and megapixels.  ASUS is the absolute leader in introducing the latest OS from Windows.  On the Russian market, VivoTab RT is the first device on the new Windows RT operating system.  Today we will study a sample with a 3G module. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/4fe/081/7a8/4fe0817a83ef8e1130e89b3060c1bb57.jpg"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h5>  Appearance and positioning </h5><br>  Design VivoTab RT is designed in the concept of "all the best you will see here." <br>  And indeed, thanks to the latest developments and recognizable style, ASUS has received a product that can confidently compete with other sharks of the IT industry.

      Contents of delivery: <br><ul><li>  the tablet; </li><li>  collecting charger; </li><li>  adapter, with which you can get a full USB-connector; </li><li>  napkin; </li><li>  clip to remove the SIM card. </li></ul><br>  You can also purchase a keyboard dock. <br><br>  Dimensions - 262.5 x 170.9 x 8.3 mm. <br>  The display size is 10.1 ". <br>  Weight - 535 g. <br><br>  Of the design features of the tablet, you can note its thin body (the tablet is thinner than many smartphones).  VivoTab RT is assembled with a minimum number of joints between the case and the display.  The display "merges" with the frame, forming a monolithic glossy surface, it is covered with a scratch-resistant protective glass Corning Fit.  All faces and corners of the tablet are rounded.  The back of the case is made of silver-colored metal, and the upper insert in the area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe camera has a soft-touch plastic finish with a nice ribbed texture. <br><br>  On the front side there are various sensors and sensors, a front camera, a logo and a touch button ‚ÄúWindows‚Äù.  On the top there is a microphone and an on / off button.  On the right side of the side there is a mini-jack hole for headphones (3.5 mm) and a volume rocker.  On the left side there is a slot for micro SD memory cards, a Micro-HDMI connector closed with a rubber stopper, an auto-rotate screen adjustment button and a sliding button that blocks the disconnection of the keyboard.  Below there are two openings for holding the VivoTab RT in the keyboard dock and a charging connector.  Behind - the main camera with LED flash, 4 speakers, as well as the logo.  ASUS thought out the ergonomics of the device well: due to the roundness, minimum thickness and the use of successful materials in the decoration of the case, the tablet fits perfectly in the hands, does not slip, it is convenient to work with it with one hand.  There are no complaints about the build quality;  There was no backlash, squeaks and pushing. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/127/301/2c6/1273012c6c0b8e4c4db6e4b351f2ff8d.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/760/246/ad3/760246ad3e460a3b93b211e4b442ceea.jpg"><br><br><h5>  Keyboard docking station (hereinafter - the keyboard) </h5><br>  The keyboard is designed in the style of ASUS, has a wedge-shaped profile, the working area and the side faces are made of metal.  On the right there is a USB 2.0 connector, on the left - a connector for recharging.  The docking station has its own battery.  The lower part of the metal with a plastic coating;  There are 4 rubber feet.  The connection point of the dock with the tablet, you can adjust and change the angle of the screen. <br>  It is not very convenient to work simultaneously with the keyboard and the screen, since  the deflection angle is not too large.  The keyboard layout and the size of the keys are optimal for comfortable work, the keys are easily pressed and tactilely pleasing, the multi-touch touchpad responds quickly to various manipulations. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/b19/9cd/759/b199cd759e1ef342fd230d56b3ba99c9.jpg"><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/a96/fba/40c/a96fba40c7acb7016fc581ee4c8e5d05.jpg"><br><br>  In general, the design is thought out to the smallest detail.  Connected devices look organic. <br><br><h5>  Screen </h5><br>  Display specifications: ‚Äì10.1 "diagonal; WXGA resolution (1366x768). <br><br>  The glass plate on the ASUS VivoTab screen has a very high-quality oleophobic coating, on which fingerprints are almost invisible, and if they are, they are easily removed.  Using an effective anti-glare filter has a positive effect on working with the tablet in the presence of bright light sources (sun, lamps, etc.).  The Multi-touch technology used to create the screen supports 10 simultaneous clicks.  The response time is very high, which is definitely a plus. <br><br>  The Super IPS + matrix technology gives a large margin of brightness (about 700 cd / m¬≤) and good viewing angles (178 degrees) without inverting the shades.  The image looks good, but there are also disadvantages: black and shades of gray are transmitted less accurately than those of AMOLED matrices. <br><br>  The device used software technology ASUS TruVivid, which increases the efficiency of the screen backlight for more vivid colors. <br><br>  The screen makes a good impression, it is convenient and pleasant to play, read, surf the Internet, watch movies on it. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/a77/680/f94/a77680f949d9d7fcd741fe194e827985.jpg"><br><br><h5>  Performance </h5><br>  The ASUS VivoTab RT hardware platform is based on NVIDIA¬Æ Tegra3 with a quad-core processor operating at 1.3 GHz.  A powerful video accelerator provides support in graphics processing, the presence of 2 GB of RAM has recently become the standard.  User memory is presented in two versions: 32 and 64 GB.  This ‚Äústuffing‚Äù provides high performance in any applications, including three-dimensional games, playing HD-video, with web-surfing, and the animation and smoothness of the interface deserves special praise. <br><br><h5>  OS, software and features </h5><br>  VivoTab turned out to be one of the first devices working on the basis of the Windows RT operating system.  When turned on, we see the ASUS screensaver, then the start page, which you can slide up with your finger, then the famous Windows RT interface opens before us.  Everything is very stylish, concise and colorful.  Drawing and "physics" of tiles fully reflects the concept of a tiled interface.  Then you can go to the more familiar to us Desktop interface (classic Windows 7), where there is a basket, shortcuts, folder system, etc.  It will be necessary to get used to the logic and intuitiveness of the interface.  Although Microsoft assures that this is a step in the future.  When you first turn on (or later), you need to activate your version of Windows via the Internet, otherwise the ability to change many settings will not be available.  And get ready for the constant requests for system updates and applications, the system is actively developing. <br><br>  With Windows RT comes a fully functional version of Microsoft Office 2013 with Word, Excel, PowerPoint and OneNote programs - this is a definite plus. <br>  Only Internet Explorer that supports Flash is preinstalled from browsers. <br>  Standard maps are uninformative and still raw for Russia.  All applications can be downloaded exclusively from Windows Store - a kind of analogue of Google Play and the Apple App Store.  This gives the right to use this software on 5 different machines at the same time (scenarios ‚Äì tablet, home PC, laptop, etc.), which ultimately reduces the cost of ownership.  Almost all applications are optimized for the system interface and have a similar design style.  The choice of applications is not very large, but you can easily find the most necessary ones.  The platform is actively developing, and the number of programs is growing every day. <br><br>  In VivoTab RT you can find interesting pre-installed programs and services: <br><br>  ASUS camera - a camera with advanced settings; <br>  AMAZON KINDLE - the service of "cloud" storage of books; <br>  ASUS @vibe Fun Center - music; <br>  Guide ‚Äìguide on the device; <br>  MyLibrary is a firmware for reading; <br>  My Dictionary - built-in dictionary with the function of the translator; <br>  SuperNote - Asus' own note service;  allows you to record notes and save information from a variety of sources (keyboard, finger input, photo and video, audio notes); <br>  ASUS WebStorage - free three-year access to the "cloud" online file storage of 32 GB. <br><br><h5>  Sound </h5><br>  SonicMaster audio technology is implemented in VivoTab RT, providing excellent sound quality.  Specialists from Waves Audio, the owners of the Technical GRAMMY award, took part in its creation. <br><br>  This unique hardware solution in combination with four speakers gives ASUS the right to set the bar in the field of sound in mobile devices.  The sound is very clear, surround, well listened to both high and low frequencies, at maximum volume there are no artifacts. <br><br><h5>  Camera </h5><br>  The tablet uses a 8 megapixel camera, equipped with a back-illuminated CMOS-sensor with a large aperture, auto focus and LED flash.  Front camera 2 megapixel.  The main camera has a maximum resolution of 3280 x 2460 pixels and Full HD video. <br>  The advantages of the camera include high-speed shooting, as well as a wide range of settings and parameters that will help to achieve the best result.  Pictures are sharp, accurate in color, with an acceptable white balance.  But, alas, when shooting with insufficient light, noise is visible, which is present on many ASUS devices. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/f9d/231/d00/f9d231d0057cb79836eff5db4c4b8f46.jpg"><br><br><h5>  Wireless modules </h5><br>  Wi-Fi 802.11a / b / g / n - the signal takes well, but there are cliffs.  I think this is a test sample flaw. <br>  Bluetooth 4.0 - data transfer speed is standard for this modification. <br>  GPS, A-GPS, Glonass. <br>  NFC is a short-range wireless high-frequency communication technology that enables data exchange between devices located at a distance of about 10 centimeters. <br><br><h5>  Working hours </h5><br>  The advantages of VivoTab RT include autonomy and low power consumption.  By itself, Windows RT is economical in terms of resources, and in conjunction with optimizing the operating system and the latest matrix production technology, we get a very ‚Äúrobust‚Äù device.  The built-in lithium-polymer battery is able to provide 2 days of work at moderate loads, and at maximum (watching video at maximum brightness, using background programs, wireless modules included) - about 7‚Äì8 hours.  When you connect the keyboard dock, this figure increases to 15 hours. <br><br><h5>  Conclusion </h5><br>  VivoTab RT can definitely be called a breakthrough from ASUS.  It is instantly transformed from a tablet into a compact netbook, has powerful technical characteristics and a unique design.  The buyer has a wide range of modifications, which helps to choose the best option.  The first delivery in the Russian Federation - with a dock, 3G, with a memory of 64 GB. <br><br><habracut></habracut></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/169555/">https://habr.com/ru/post/169555/</a></p>
