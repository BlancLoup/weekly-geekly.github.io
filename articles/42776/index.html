  <section class="page js-page"><h1>"The Big Bang Theory"</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  We all undoubtedly love comedy.  It seems to me that this is caused by our need to smile, fill your body with large doses of endorphin and get pleasure from life.  The comical sitcom about young physicists ‚ÄúThe Big Bang Theory‚Äù is a great way to laugh heartily and raise your spirits to the ‚Äúmaximum‚Äù mark. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="http://zigazaga.tv/blog/wp-content/uploads/2008/10/big-bang-1.jpg" alt="The Big Bang Theory"></div><br>  The story begins with two brilliant physicists, Leonard and Sheldon, who are extremely closed on their favorite science.  They consider themselves to be young geniuses and are well aware of how the universe works.  Fans of computer games, comics, science fiction - all these phrases best reflect their way of life.  Sheldon, among other things, is extremely arrogant and "botanical", which affects the attitude of others around him. <br>  At this point, it was safe to assume that not everything worked out well for girls with young talents.  To be frank, they have nothing to do with anyone, and their fate is unfavorable to them.  But our world is full of paradoxes, and everything changes abruptly when the pretty blonde Penny moves into the apartment opposite.  Quantum mechanics, elementary particles, the theory of relativity - these words are completely alien to her, but this does not prevent Leonard, despite the active protests of Sheldon, to get acquainted with Penny, to become friends with her and then fall in love.  It turns out that physicists can have feelings not only for atoms and particles. <br><br>  All cycles in the series do not pass without the influence of Volovitts and Kutropali - two more friends of our dear scientists.  Of course, they are also scientists and, of course, physicists.  Physicists do not like non-physicists - this is a fact.  If you try to describe these two characters in a few words, then Volovitz is sex obsessed, dandy and loving to throw out various phrases in foreign languages, including Russian, a little man, and Kutropali is an intelligent Indian young man who loses the gift of speech at the sight of pretty women and acquiring him back after heavy drinking of alcohol.

      The main feature of this sitcom is that with each new series it does not become more boring or less cheerful - the bar taken by the creators after the pilot series is shown keeps everything at the same height, or even higher.  The most interesting thing is that from the Theory of the Big Bang, many viewers can learn something vital for themselves.  For example, in one of the last episodes, the current issue of gaming addiction was wonderfully ridiculed - besides the comedy, the writers put instructive notes into the series and, apparently, they are doing quite well. <br><br>  By the way, the series began its march on television screens only a year ago, and at the moment only the second season is broadcast in full swing.  Believe me, this interesting, instructive and cheerful sitcom will not leave anyone indifferent. <br><br>  <a href="http://zigazaga.tv/us-tv-shows/the-big-bang-theory/smeshnye-fiziki/">Cross-post</a> from a great blog about TV shows - <a href="http://zigazaga.tv/">ZigaZaga</a> . </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/42776/">https://habr.com/ru/post/42776/</a></p>
