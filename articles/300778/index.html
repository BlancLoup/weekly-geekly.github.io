      A word to the professional. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  <b>Current Location:</b> <br>  Moscow, Russia <br><br>  <b>Current place of work:</b> <br>  Representative office of Calix in Russia, the CIS and Mongolia <br><br>  <b>Education:</b> <br>  Higher, State University of Management, Information Systems in Management, <br>  MBA, Academy of National Economy under the Government of the Russian Federation, IBDA (Institute of Business and Business Administration). <br><br>  <b>One word that best describes how you work:</b> <br>  Committed to <br><br>  <b>How many hours a day do you work?</b> <br>  8-10. <br><br>  In the morning I plan meetings, while my head is fresh and I have the strength to convince.  Also in the morning I work on all new ideas and projects.  In the afternoon, I do things that are postponed: I sort out the mail, create new presentations, write regulations, or discuss business issues. <br><br>  In the evening, time for maximum concentration on a specific task, when the phone is not disturbed and the mail is closed. <br><br>  <b>Current mobile device:</b> <br>  iPhone 6S Plus <br><br>  <b>Current computer:</b> <br>  Macbook Air 13 " <br><br>  <b>Without any applications, programs, utilities you can not live?</b> <br>  Corporate applications that are established in our company are Outlook and Salesforce.  Characteristically, they are not enough for productive work.  To help them, I have AmoCRM, where we work as a team.  I also use Evernote as a knowledge base, for example, to store descriptions, procedures, instructions.  I also work in MindNode on an iPad / iPhone, it's easier in a spare moment to reset the picture of logical connections from the head into the scheme. <br><br>  All files and data I store in the cloud in order to access them from different devices. <br><br>  <b>Which life hack helps you save time?</b> <br>  - Quarterly action plan tied to sales figures helps to set long-term priorities correctly and not waste time on unnecessary projects <br><br>  - For about two months, I estimate the schedule of trips, key meetings, as well as speeches and publications that we need to do. <br><br>  - Every week I make a list of the first and second priority - the first are important tasks, the second are urgent tasks <br><br>  - To delegate and involve the team in the work is more important than to achieve perfectionism in the "do it yourself" mode.  For this you need to hire independent people. <br><br>  <b>What kind of to-do manager do you use?</b> <br>  Three or four times I started using the application on the iPhone, but it quickly becomes overwhelmed with unfulfilled business and I refused. <br><br>  I use A4 notebook for lists and a diary as a weekly priority planner. <br><br>  Outlook I use for the plan of meetings, performances and trips. <br><br>  <b>What do you listen when you work?</b> <br>  Silence <br><br>  <b>What are you reading now?</b> <br>  "World War II" by Anthony Beevor <br><br>  <b>Which book from the last read was remembered the most?</b> <br>  "Flow: the psychology of optimal experience" Mihai Cikszentmihayi, <br>  "Volokolamsk Highway" Alexander Beck <br><br>  <b>Do you use e-readers or prefer paper books?</b> <br>  I use electronic readers and iPhone. <br><br>  <b>How long do you sleep?</b> <br>  7-8 hours <br><br>  <b>Are you an owl or a lark?</b> <br>  A lark who is friends with an owl. <br><br>  <b>How do you have breakfast?</b> <br>  Breakfast forms the day, so I take it seriously.  On those days, when I go to the gym, I have breakfast twice - oatmeal before workout, plus proteins and carbohydrates after. <br><br>  On other days I try to eat in a variety of ways, so that I charge with short and long carbohydrates and vitamins. <br><br>  <b>How do you spend your time on the way to work / from work?</b> <br>  I listen to "Business FM" or podcasts, if I go by car.  I choose the music heavier, if I go on a motorcycle. <br><br>  <b>What advice you have ever been given can you convey to others?</b> <br>  1. Submit a result before starting a business.  Think what answer you want when you ask a question. <br><br>  2. Always do what you want.  It is better to err than to regret not having tried. <br><br>  And remember that the journey of a thousand li begins with the first step (Lao Tzu).  In other words - any task becomes easy if you break it down into simplest elements (make decomposition). </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/300778/">https://habr.com/ru/post/300778/</a></p>
