And for good reason, because it is quite a convenient device for reading websites and working with e-mail.  It can perform most daily tasks.  Many users are very fond of playing games, which appeared on the tablets a very large number.  All this was made possible thanks to the niche that occupied the tablet.  A good tablet has almost mobility smartphone performance, which is close to the netbook.  Very successful middle ground. <br><br>  Once a computer made its way from the world of scientific and industrial applications into the world of home appliances and consumer goods.  Now the tablet (and the tablet is a kind of computer) travels in the opposite direction. <a name="habracut"></a>  Now the tablet computer has become an indispensable attribute of youth culture, students.  Many business people also use the tablet for business purposes, and the corporate sector has adopted a tablet.  It's really convenient: the Internet, mail, messaging and video chat are very useful features that, while remaining comfortable, are now placed in a jacket pocket. <br><br>  Consumer and corporate markets are the most obvious areas in which a tablet can be in demand.  But that's not all.  Here is a small example of using the <a href="http://www.kpda.ru/BSP/PlayBook">BlackBerry PlayBook</a> in a police car.

Access to the database, control devices in the machine, video registration, etc.  - With this, the BlackBerry PlayBook copes perfectly.  Later, the second version of this concept car appeared.  Such necessary things for traffic police as a mobile printer and a rights scanner were added. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/-q1ZCH6qIFA%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700022,15700186,15700190,15700253,15700255,15700259&amp;usg=ALkJrhjoWRUiwtIQ6vA7gXwb2IqSOBUWjQ" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  I wonder why both of these concept cars are based on the BlackBerry PlayBook?  It seems to me that this is not a random choice.  The main highlight of the PlayBook is an operating system based on QNX.  <a href="http://www.kpda.ru/QNX6/Neutrino">The QNX real-time operating system</a> has proven itself in many areas of responsible use: nuclear power, aerospace, military use, medicine, automotive, robotics, the metro, ATMs and payment terminals.  This is not a complete list.  Surely, you often, if not every day, come across QNX, but you may not even know it.  On Habr√© there is my note about QNX, I invite everyone interested to <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/nix/124656/">get acquainted with it</a> . <br><br>  An important factor when choosing a QNX RTOS as the ‚Äúheart‚Äù of the police concept car was <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/infosecurity/125065/">FIPS 140-2 certification</a> .  The BlackBerry PlayBook is the first tablet certified for use in US federal organizations.  FIPS 140-2 certification is not the only QNX certification example.  More information about certificates can be read on the official website qnx.com ( <a href="http://www.qnx.com/products/certifications.html">here</a> and <a href="http://www.qnx.com/products/neutrino-rtos/index.html">here</a> ).  It will certainly be interesting to know that the QNX RTOS was certified not only abroad, but also in Russia.  Based on QNX, <a href="http://www.kpda.ru/Solutions/KPDA">ASTVA CPDA.00002-01</a> and <a href="http://www.kpda.ru/KPDA6/KPDA6">AORSPCPA.10964-01 are based</a> . <br><br>  An additional advantage of the PlayBook is the tight integration with BlackBerry smartphones.  For example, a tablet can act as a terminal for a smartphone, and in this case, the confidentiality of smartphone data is not compromised. <br><br>  In the world of tablets, as in the world of operating systems, there is a division into the scope of application.  And if there are entertainment tablets and tablets for business, then there are tablets for industrial and responsible use.  The QNX RTOS, which lies at the heart of the PlayBook, allows the latter not only to easily cope with consumer and business tasks, but also to guarantee high reliability of applications. <br><br>  Where else can a tablet be used?  This is probably the perfect terminal.  Lightweight, compact, fairly productive, fairly autonomous.  Imagine yourself as an engineer or technician who needs to collect evidence from a variety of devices in a huge factory or in a large number of dispersed objects.  With the tablet and its wireless connectivity this task becomes much easier.  It is enough to go to the equipment and run the application for data collection.  If necessary, you can make adjustments to the equipment: restart the system or individual tasks, set new operating parameters.  Similarly, you can not only read the report files (logs), but also install updates.  The BlackBerry PlayBook has a good screen.  It will allow completely or almost completely abandon monitors where the monitor is required for five minutes twice a year.  Simply connect to the rack via VNC or another similar protocol and monitor in your palm. <br><br>  As I wrote at the very beginning, a tablet computer has recently appeared on the market, its potential has not yet been fully revealed.  It seems that in industry and other areas of responsible use, he has not yet spoken.  I think that this device alone in many cases will be able to replace a smartphone, computer, terminal and monitor.  When to wait for this?  We'll see. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/137085/">https://habr.com/ru/post/137085/</a></p>
