  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Results of the year from Samsung</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  The new year is getting closer - now is the time to take stock of the year.  We have something to be proud of: this year ... But let's get everything in order.  We decided to recall all the main areas in which we worked in the past year, and recall the most interesting devices of the years. <br><br><h4>  Samsung's Trends of the Year </h4><br><br><h5>  In 3D format </h5><br>  Now this is hard to believe, but a year ago, stereo television could still be found only at exhibitions, and they were not yet in free sale.  In the spring of 2010, we were the first in the world to launch mass production of 3D TVs, and today a whole line is on the market: from budget plasma to huge home theaters. 
      <br>

      <br>
      Generally, if you remember, we started producing the first 3D TVs three years ago, but the real vision was only in 2010.  In many ways, it‚Äôs worth saying ‚Äúthank you‚Äù to the content producers - the film industry, game developers, TV companies, etc. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/42b/6ab/093/42b6ab093416c2cfa42c37b28bc0be8b.jpg" alt="image"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  Especially I want to note that in Russia the assembly began almost simultaneously with the whole world - the first 3D TV in Russia went off the assembly line of our plant in the Kaluga region in April;  in the West, sales on Amazon began in March. <br><br><h5>  "Smart House" </h5><br>  Our concept of Smart Life was invented, of course, not in the outgoing year, but it can be called boldly the trend of two thousand and ten.  Now not only the smart phones have become, but the rest of the equipment has also begun to grow smarter - and televisions, refrigerators, washing machines, etc. <br><br>  ‚ÄúComplying with the principles of Smart Life for Samsung means giving users the opportunity to be constantly in touch without knowing the boundaries.  Being socially active, enjoying vivid, vivid images and creating your own delightful stories is the exciting and interesting life in the style of Smart Life, ‚Äùsaid BooKeun Yoon, President of our Visual Display division at the 2010 IFA conference. <br><br>  An important trend is the transformation of the TV into a kind of Internet access console.  Already, the Samsung Internet @ TV service is available on many TVs and Blu-ray players, allowing users to have access to more than 40 applications, from LoveFilm to Skype.  In the near future, we plan to increase the number of proposed applications three times, adding support for Blinkbox, AceTrax and 4oD. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/3ef/f18/218/3eff182187ee79e58779f19cdcf5fee7.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Meanwhile, in our online app store <a href="http://www.samsungapps.com/">Samsung App</a> s, which recently celebrated a kind of anniversary - a million downloads, applications have appeared not only for phones and mobile devices, but also for home appliances - applications for televisions and high-definition television, for example. <br><br><br><h5>  Ecology </h5><br>  In August this year, at the IFA conference, the aforementioned president of our Visual Display division, Mr. Yun, recalled that until 2013, Samsung plans to become one of the greenest companies in the world.  However, already this year we have done a lot: <br><br>  - In March, together with the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), the program ‚ÄúChange the World with Energy Star‚Äù was launched, aimed at actively promoting the Energy Star energy saving standard; <br><br>  - With our partner support, the eCycling program was launched, which encourages and encourages consumers to recycle their old electronics for recycling or recycling; <br><br>  - At the beginning of the year, at CES 2010, we presented a range of environmentally friendly and energy-efficient products, including the new series of LED TVs and digital photo frames with an OLED display; <br><br>  - a new series of energy efficient Eco Basic microwave ovens, Eco Bubble washing machines, etc .; <br><br>  - introduced the eco-friendly 2TB F3EG hard drive for high-performance home PCs <br><br>  - just a few weeks ago, the market introduced the line of the most compact monochrome printers in the world with the function of environmental printing. <br><br><h5>  Ocean bada </h5><br>  In 2010, our own mobile platform bada was launched.  For the first four months of its existence, it was in greater demand than Android for the same period immediately after the release, and by the end of the third quarter of 2010, it was already 2% of the global market, and this was despite the fact that it was placed only on a limited line of smartphones - Wave (S8500), Wave 2 (S5250), Wave 2 Pro (S5330), etc. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/97e/c56/291/97ec562919636e90a11885f8dd057b3c.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  At the core of the bada open platform is the RTOS or Linux kernel.  And it is used not only on smartphones, but also on TVs.  In the above mentioned Samsung Apps store you can find quite a few applications for bada - we actively support developers, conduct bada Developers' Challenge, a post about the final of which will soon appear on Habr√©. <br><br><h4>  Devices of the year </h4><br><br><h5>  Mobile computing </h5><br>  In general, the popularity of portable devices can be called this year a global trend. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/870/ce3/4fd/870ce34fde4a1d3e64911ad220d75c23.png" alt="image"><br><br>  Note, of course, the Galaxy Tab tablet (on Android).  During his presentation on the Russian market, <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/samsung/blog/105148/">Anatoly Wasserman</a> tested it.  The main thing about this device: 7-inch display, weight 350 grams, full Internet navigation, multimedia (up to HD video playback), Samsung bookstore, connection to social media via Social Hub, augmented reality through Layar, etc. <br><br><img src="http://www.cndlive.com/image/cache/data/gimage/samsung_rf510_2_medium-500x500.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  It is worth remembering the line of laptops RF - RF510 in particular with such pleasant things as recharging via USB-port in sleep mode, accelerated file transfer via USB 3.0, high-speed connection according to the standard BlueTooth High Speed. <br><br><h5>  Smartphones </h5><br>  In the past year, we launched many smartphones on the market, including flagships such as the Galaxy S and Wave. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/d7a/f55/1ed/d7af551ed879a450aa29bb0beb624953.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Galaxy S (on the Android platform) is equipped with a huge Super AMOLED four-inch display, a 1 GHz processor and a large 16GB memory, and also supports Micro SD cards.  It supports the functions of SWYPE and the functions of Write &amp; Go, Layar (augmented reality), ThinkFree, AllShare, and others. In just the first ten days of sales in Korea <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/samsung/blog/98594/">,</a> more than 200 thousand copies were sold. <br><br><img src="http://www.reevoo.com/decidewhattobuy/wp-content/uploads/2010/05/samsung-wave.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Galaxy Wave (on the bada platform): a super-bright AMOLED-display a little smaller (3.3 inches), the processor frequency is the same - 1 GHz.  The smartphone allows you to record and play videos in HD-quality, as well as synchronize work in social media through the Social Hub. <br><br><h5>  Other news </h5><br><img src="http://www.home-entertainment-news.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/Samsung-SP-H03-front.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  We should also mention the unique ultra-light portable LED <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/samsung/blog/102225/">pico-projector</a> SP-H03 the size of a pack of cigarettes (7x7 cm) and weighing only 170 grams, which allows you to create a small open-air cinema or ride around the city with presentations. <br><br><img src="http://www.jessops.com/ce-images/PRODUCT/PRODUCT_ENLARGED/CSAMSCM195158292_003.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  And about the NX100 camera released this year (NX line), a unique feature of which is the i-Function lens, by pressing which you can choose the desired parameter (ISO, shutter speed, aperture, exposure compensation and white balance) and easily change the value of the parameter by turning one ring lens mount.  NX100 already became the key model in the new category of mirrorless system cameras <br><br><br><h4>  Future </h4><br><br>  The other day we have already <a href="http://www.3dnews.ru/software-news/samsung-obnarodovala-podrobnosti-bada-20/">announced the</a> release of a new version of the bada 2.0 mobile platform in the first half of next year.  The new operating system will provide support for multi-touch technology, NFC (like Android 2.3 Gingerbread), HTML5, FlashLite 4, increased security and enhanced integration with popular social services.  In total, in the first half of 2011 alone, at least 10 million smartphones on our platform should come out.  But, as you know, we just started to reveal our ‚Äúcards‚Äù. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/42d/9b5/9ea/42d9b59eaa4b8c579697559360df63cd.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Wait for the next surprises at the beginning of next year - in January and February, when CES will be held in Las Vegas and the third Samsung Forum for CIS countries.  And there will be surprises;) </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/110496/">https://habr.com/ru/post/110496/</a></p>
