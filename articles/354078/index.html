In a blitz-interview format, Oleg Khaustov's Head of Performance Marketing (Delivery Club) shares grosh hacks and monetization trends in products. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/8Y-oWnsMvCk" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br>  Watch the interview and read the transcript under the cut. <a name="habracut"></a><br><br><h3>  3 products - synonymous with growth-hacking? </h3><br>  I am very pleased with what Skyeng does in Russia, what Foodadil and Tinkoff does - these are real groos hackers.  For me, these are three products, three businesses that, in a sense, turned the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãhow a product should be transformed to show the real Growth Hack.

    <h3>  Growth-story product? </h3><br>  The biggest player in the cleaning world is Handy service.  The largest cleaning service in the world, which, in my opinion, is 10 times more than Qlean.  One of the biggest hacks that changed the business and which will largely be the next step for Qlean and for similar services is a hack when the product completely abandons offline operations.  When the project abandons the office, from live interviews, and completely goes to the online funnel. <br><br>  The classic example in Russia is Dostavista - a service that refused offline dialing, switched to online, and due to this, it showed a multiple growth.  All projects that switch to online funnels in the supply part start and scale sharply at 10, 20, 30 times. <br><br><h3>  Quick wins in the product? </h3><br>  In the case of Qlean, strong growth has shown happy week days.  This is a sale of slots for cleaning inside the week, which are not profitable for the majority of the population, and for which we can make a small discount and give it back cheaper.  What have we done?  We looked at the distribution of our orders;  understood which of the days of the strong subsidence, and shifted the opposite.  Quickly made the page design and hung the first slots. <br><br>  Thus, we downloaded the cleaners, allowed customers for less money to get the product that they want to try.  Did it in a week.  The first version was raw.  The user left the phone in the application form, the application fell into the call center, and the call center manually scheduled the cleaning.  There was no automation.  In one day on weekdays, this hack increased the load on orders by 30%.  Then we began to scale, and in a couple of months we made a complete product out of it.  The users liked it.  People were ready to give up their convenient time in order to save a little.  It was a real breakthrough. <br><br>  In the case of Delivery, the gros hacks are more in the marketing plane.  We have collections of various restaurants for a particular subject.  At some point, we realized that the selection is not only a content story, when we can tell where to have breakfast and so on.  We began to use collections for marketing purposes, to organize various contests.  This also showed the most powerful result.  You slightly change Call To Action, and for the user it becomes not just a content history, but a marketing tool. <br><br><h3>  What product on the market are you missing? </h3><br>  I will answer as a marketer.  There is a lack of a full-fledged automated platform for working with bloggers.  Anyone who makes a full-fledged tool, will turn the process into a digitized economy - get rich and change the market. <br><br><h3>  The trend in the monetization of the product? </h3><br>  Here it is necessary to separate the products that live in the field of content, that is, first of all, they supply users with content and products that live as a transactional business.  If we talk about content, then the trend in the transition to the transaction is logical.  If you have, for example, the information application "Theater", which informs about the latest news in the world of theater.  It is logical that the user in the application can make an order, pre-order or other call to action. <br><br>  For applications that work with content, the monetization trend is a transition to transactions.  And just in the question of those services that are already working on a transaction - this is an appeal to the content. <br><br><h3>  How to work with a team? </h3><br>  What happens if you don‚Äôt tell people what to do?  Every new day you begin to see how people begin to cooperate in a fantastic way, set themselves tasks, go to the product and say: ‚ÄúWe lack this.‚Äù  When this starts to happen, then the leader only directs people. <br><br>  We have now checked one interesting feature - KPI for the team, which the team has set for itself.  I said, "Write a plan, how you see, how we should grow further."  The guys wrote, we discussed this one by one, then we discussed it all together and came to the conclusion that this format is much more convenient: people understand and form their responsibility.  And as soon as the employee directly forms his responsibility, synergy occurs here - the person begins to feel part of the business. <br><br><h3>  What will the product profession look like in five 5 years? </h3><br>  The profession of the next 5 years is a marketing product that does smart things, integrates with the advertising services that are now.  Targetologists, contextual advertising managers will quit or transform into marketing products. <br><br><h3>  Best services for work? </h3><br>  What attracted me a lot and what I use quite actively now is the ‚ÄúNotion‚Äù service.  I'm starting to notice that more and more product managers and marketers are starting to use this service.  Notion is a complete platform that combines the ability to create, store content.  This is Dropbox Paper in combination with Trello and Jira.  There are a lot of convenient features inside the project. <br><br>  Another excellent analytic service for work is Airbnb Open Source BI. <br><br>  Share your Facebook stories with the hashtag #epicgrowthstory.  The best authors will receive prizes from Gett and fall into the selection of the <a href="http://egconf.ru/growthstory">best stories</a> . </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/354078/">https://habr.com/ru/post/354078/</a></p>
