  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Brain and computer. Is the comparison appropriate?</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Many have seen, heard and read about how people compare a person and a computer.  It‚Äôs interesting to watch this process, especially when you understand what is really happening.  But in fact, nothing happens, neither more nor less than a comparison of the creator with the creation.  In order for this comparison to take place, people even make robots look like people.  But still, inside such subhumans ‚Äúgears and light bulbs‚Äù, as the hero of the film ‚ÄúI, Robot‚Äù said.  But the point is not that those compared to people differ in their chemical composition.  After all, the subject of comparison is the principle and effectiveness of their work. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/habraeffect/fd/e0/fde0f5e2bdd527ff1b1f81232db8a948.jpg" alt="image"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  All aspects of the work process and the results of this very work of both compared sides can hardly be embraced in one small article.  Therefore, I will touch on only one aspect, which in computer language is called ‚Äúmultitasking‚Äù.  Some people think that this is unattainable for the brain, others share the exact opposite point of view.  I will not go into such jungles like numbers, calculations and statistics, since comparing systems of different origins is not possible to achieve accurate results.  But there are some thoughts on this. <br>  So‚Ä¶

      I am sure that when creating a computer, a person was guided by the fact that he is close and familiar.  When creating the operating system in the mid-60s of the last century (it was then that the beginnings of multitasking began to appear in some operating systems), programmers, it was also possible that they were thinking about giving the computer something human.  And gave it a subconscious, only in computer sense.  Although many people know the fact that the human brain at a certain point in time can consciously reflect on one thing, but this does not at all mean that our brain is devoid of "multitasking."  After all, it is unlikely that anyone will deny that, in addition to the basic idea, which is consciously spinning in our head, there are processes somewhere deep in the subconscious that are only known when the result is visible. <br><br>  If you allow, compare the consciousness and the subconscious with the processor cores.  True in this comparison, these cores will be of different capacities.  Since there is information that the power of the subconscious is much more power of consciousness.  The speed of information processing in conscious thinking is <b>2 Kbit of</b> information per second, for comparison, the same speed in the subconscious reaches <b>4 Gbit of</b> information per second.  But how does this power of the subconscious manifest. <br><br>  For example, it often happens that by applying efforts to solve a complex task consciously, it is impossible to achieve the desired result, as if there was a hitch.  In this case, I leave this task for later and accept the next, simpler one.  But suddenly, not even having time to tackle a simple task, I say to myself: ‚ÄúIdea!‚Äù.  After that, that difficult unsolved problem turns out to be solved!  But how?  I'm already desperate and did not even think about it consciously.  It is due to the fact that we put a lot of effort in the search for a solution, the process starts and, if necessary, can go into the ‚Äúbackground‚Äù of the subconscious, where neurons will continue to select the right combinations, in search of a solution with even greater speed. <br><br>  On a computer, this happens, it seems, a little easier or somewhat clearer.  Starting one process, we turn off the program and take on another.  In this case, we are confident that the operation will be completed.  Of course, sometimes it seems that the capabilities of a computer are limited by the capabilities of a person.  For example, we cannot work simultaneously in several programs, if only because for this we would need additional manipulators and, in the end, additional hands.  And is it really necessary, if sometimes we cannot even control 10% of the capacity of our brain? <br><br>  There are quite a few books written on how to train your brain, as many films were shot, but it seems that in order to ‚Äúbreak up‚Äù your brain, you need to remember just a few simple rules: <br><ul><li>  Meditate </li><li>  Analyze </li><li>  Do not give up </li></ul></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/98044/">https://habr.com/ru/post/98044/</a></p>
