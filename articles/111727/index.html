  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Educational complex "42.School"</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Good day! <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/5f2da773/20896489/845be1bc/1e6c47e0.png" align="left">  ‚Äú42.School‚Äù is an educational complex for teaching economics, entrepreneurship and financial literacy in schools.  It is clear that the project includes two components: methodology and theory, as well as implementation.  I will not write about the methodology in this article, as I understood that theories that are not supported by the result can cause irritation.  For the same reason, I ask you to leave the reasoning that ‚Äúthere are no computers in schools, teachers are not paid, but children are not interested‚Äù aside, especially since they are wrong. <br><br><h4>  Beginning of work </h4>
      <br>
        <script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>
        <ins class="adsbygoogle"
          style="display:block; text-align:center;"
          data-ad-layout="in-article"
          data-ad-format="fluid"

      <br>
      Each student for whom the license is paid is given a password, and the login is his last name.  In addition, teachers who work with the system receive their passwords. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/c9b38923/ea306873/fc0926fc/d0f603e4.png"><br><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Since students can be 20-30, and computers - 10-15, several students can log in at once. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/6f635a2c/2f194c42/78410522/f7334205.png"><br><br>  The teacher can choose the class with which he wants to work. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/2adf22f6/eba03fbb/5df25bbd/76fac363.png"><br><br>  The next thing you need to do is choose the desired lesson.  This is done by clicking on the Play button. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/2c9dba7a/a79790c4/ccec65e1/f4e45084.png"><br><br>  The icons on the right reveal the content of the lesson: industry (11 pieces available), test availability, scenario availability (changes in the external environment) and advanced modes (marketing, innovations, finance and equipment).  Clicking on the icons brings up a lightbox with their description, and clicking to the left opens the lesson plate.  The light bulb on the right is green for the selected lesson. <br><br>  To start a game or test, you need to open the plate of the corresponding lesson and click the button. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/fd0efe8a/85d50bf3/d8c5dfd4/e5d24ef8.png"><br><br>  At the top of the screen, the selected lesson is always visible, the current game / test or their number, if greater than 1, as well as the articles included in the lesson. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/5e12b7e8/acc5d5c1/124b90e2/51c5ef93.png"><br><h4>  Games </h4><br>  When the teacher has chosen a game, players are automatically transferred to the page for choosing a company name.  The name is necessary, because  one player may be several students, besides, so interesting. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/3af1639d/de4c90d4/f94c1020/881eeee6.png"><br><br>  The teacher has a setting: you can switch all modes at once for all students, or you can select them from the list by ticks, then you can run different modes for different groups of students.  This is more complicated and is not considered further. <br><br>  The process itself, the options, the possibilities of games are quite diverse, but the basic version is simple. <br>  And so, in any case, all players compete with each other in the same market, make decisions for each period, and then the period is calculated and the result is obtained in the form of players' profits.  Profit along with other parameters determine the number of points that determines the winner.  There is an automatic prompt system to avoid completely bad results in case the teacher does not follow. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/193eec6e/ac517526/af31e8cc/3fea0080.png"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/783cc529/66620da2/6fce4fd9/658661b2.png"><br><br>  Nothing is required from the teacher at this moment, everything works itself.  In general, in order for the game to start, the teacher only needs to log in, open the lesson and click Start.  Everything.  Given that they are obliged to use the sites of the district and so forth - a task feasible for anyone.  Someone who is more advanced can use additional chips. <br><br>  In general, the teacher sees the game as something like this: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/e19f3329/f9cc4b41/788b6a92/182ead3c.png"><br><br>  If the game has a script, the teacher will see it.  At the same time, convenient text is generated automatically (‚ÄúDemand will drop by 20%‚Äù). <br><h4>  Tests </h4><br>  Everything is simple, the students are shown questions with answer options or a field for a free-form answer.  In the end, the accumulated number of points from the maximum possible. <br><br>  Each question is assigned a difficulty.  For closed questions, the correct answer is == maximum score.  For open - set by the teacher. <br>  At the teacher, everything is displayed in real time, the students' answers are loaded and statistics are output.  If you need to evaluate something (free response), then this also happens without departing from the cash register. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/0901e2c6/6d7e55f9/14002bcc/8731db58.png"><br><br>  Assessment is not specifically translated into a five-digit scale, because  boundaries may be different for different teachers. <br><br><h4>  User Content </h4><br>  In general, everything can be different for different teachers. <br>  Therefore, everything can be changed.  The editors of games, tests, articles and their collections (lessons) are available to teachers, and they can also group lessons into training courses. <br>  At the same time, there is a ‚Äúversion‚Äù mechanism, so each teacher has his own content.  With the permission of the teacher and the approval of the moderator version becomes available to all participants in the system. <br><br>  Unfortunately, the editor of all this does not shine, so far, the beauty and originality of the solutions, because without any screenshots. <br><br><h4>  Equipment </h4><br>  The system is based on CodeIgniter, PHP5, MySQL. <br>  The code is currently quite confusing due to the change of several developers, and cleaning is expected before adding new features. <br><br><h4>  Conclusion </h4><br>  "42. School" is recommended for use in schools in grades 9-11 methodical centers of the northern district of Moscow.  Ready to work on a regular school curriculum (although this concept is extensible, there are at least two ‚Äúregular‚Äù ones), you can modify it to any  Or generally use only the mechanism of games / tests, the theory does not include.  Fortunately, in any case, you first need to explain verbally. <br><br>  There are three people in the team now: a methodologist / marketer, a developer, and I, for simplicity, we say that it is also a developer.  Sales are not very good, although everyone likes it.  Variants are being prepared for other uses (colleges, universities, business trainings).  I invite everyone who is interested to cooperate. <br><br>  The company was established in the business incubator of the Bauman Moscow State Technical University.  I think about him and the projects that are there, as well as about the development of the company and the peculiarities of working with schools, I will tell in separate articles, especially if the community is interested. <br><br><hr><br>  Used scripts to create screenshots from an <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/devexpress/blog/106611/">article</a> from <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/users/beliakov/" class="user_link">beliakov</a> , thanks! </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/111727/">https://habr.com/ru/post/111727/</a></p>
