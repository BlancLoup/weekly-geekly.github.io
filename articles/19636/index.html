  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Local networks are 30 years old, will they live to forty?</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  In December 1977, the New York-based Chase Manhattan Bank Bank implemented the world's first commercial project to install a local area network (LAN). <br><br>  LAN made a real revolution in business.  Prior to this, people did not even suspect that it was possible to combine all computers into a single network with shared resources.  Previously, only a pair of computers combined dedicated lines, and it was very expensive and difficult.  With the advent of network protocols ARCnet, Token Ring and Ethernet, everything has changed.  First, a real battle of standards occurred, but gradually Ethernet took over. <br><br>  Unlike competitors, Ethernet had a major technological advantage: an algorithm for randomly resolving collisions.  While the other ‚Äúserious‚Äù protocols ideally did not allow for collisions and worked according to strict rules, on an Ethernet network it was possible that two devices could start simultaneous data transfer.  Such a conflict was solved by a random method: each device began a retransmission through a random number of milliseconds.  Authoritative engineers said that they would never allow a random house in their every detail thought out systems, but this approach was ultimately advantageous because it simplified the construction of networks by an order of magnitude. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Ethernet protocol was developed by engineer Bob Metcalf in the early 70s at the Xerox Palo Alto Research Center (PARC) research center.  In the first experiment, he and his colleagues achieved data transfer at a speed of almost 3 Mbit / s.  The experiment was codenamed ‚ÄúInternet‚Äù, but such a term was considered too frivolous.

      There were only about 100 nodes on all experimental LANs on the planet when Bob Metcal published his <a href="http://portal.acm.org/citation.cfm%3Fid%3D360253%26coll%3DACM%26dl%3DACM%26CFID%3D50907435%26CFTOKEN%3D49315255">revolutionary research paper</a> describing Ethernet in July 1976.  After the successful implementation of the project, Bob Metcalf left PARC to establish 3Com in 1979.  They launched the first Ethernet network card for PCs in 1981.  She worked at 10 Mbps and cost $ 5,000. <br><br>  For comparison, now Ethernet ports are so cheap that they are even embedded in smoke detectors in buildings.  Ports at 100 Mbit / s are a consumer standard, while in data centers they install ports of 10, 40 and 100 Gbit / s.  In research laboratories are very close to terabyte line. <br><br>  LAN technology recently overcame a jubilee milestone of thirty years.  Now local computer networks on Ethernet can be found everywhere, literally in every city house and in every company, but their future causes great doubts among specialists.  Some of them predict that a LAN can, in principle, disappear very quickly.  This happens in two stages: first, the company establishes a wireless LAN (this is like switching from wired telephones to cordless telephones), and then each device connects directly to the Internet without intermediation of the local network (switching from cordless telephones to mobile).  In the future, they say, each computer will have its own IPv6 address and its own separate gigabit wireless connection to the Internet. <br><br>  via <a href="http://www.computerworld.com/action/article.do%3Fcommand%3DviewArticleBasic%26articleId%3D9060198">Computerworld</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/19636/">https://habr.com/ru/post/19636/</a></p>
