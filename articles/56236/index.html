But since Evernote developed until recently mainly in the United States, and on the RuNet few know about it so far, it makes sense to tell more.  Story and video under the cut.

    <a name="habracut"></a><br>  <b>How it was</b> <br>  It all started in April 2007 in the small California town of Sunnyvale, which is known primarily as the geographical center of Silicon Valley and, perhaps, as the location of Yahoo headquarters.  By that time, there was already a small program for saving notes in the asset, but in our webbing era, this was clearly not enough.  It is not enough for users who spent most of their day in the browser, and for our investors, who believed that the offline utility under Windows is not very promising in terms of business development.  It was decided to shift to online and cross-platform, simultaneously dramatically increasing functionality, and a new plan of action was born, and some time later a new service, Evernote.  The logo has been updated, and the face of our service has become the elephant that Americans associate with the proverb ‚ÄúElephants never forget‚Äù, popular in local places. <br><br>  The past year (from February 2008 to February of this year) was full of almost continuous addition of new features to the service, so we did not suffer from lack of reasons for press releases and topics for the corporate blog.  Viewing chronologies is a rather dull exercise, better just tell you what happened in the end. <br><br>  During the year, the number of Evernote accounts exceeded 900 thousand people, and we managed to get several awards, including a victory for Crunchies 2009 in the Best Mobile Application nomination (this is for an iPhone client).  When the question arose of going beyond the borders of the United States, we realized that in addition to the general obsession with service, we are also united by something else - knowledge of the Russian language.  So the choice of the first country for localization was made unanimously. <br><br>  <b>About the service</b> <br>  The purpose of Evernote is to quickly and conveniently memorize everything that you want to remember, and view your notes, wherever you are, from any computer or mobile phone.  The service can be used on the web or through a local application for Windows, Mac OS, Windows Mobile and iPhone. <br><br>  While at the computer, you can create notes and to-do lists, memorize web pages, screenshots, digital images and PDF documents.  Using a mobile application - take pictures of ads, price tags, schedules;  save voice, print and handwritten notes, if possible with reference records to geographic coordinates.  All this information is synchronized with the Evernote servers and other user devices and becomes available wherever it is required. <br><br>  One of the most interesting features of Evernote is the ability to recognize text in images.  Previously, it worked only for English text, but now <b>Evernote recognizes text in Russian</b> !  I must say that this moment was the most critical and constantly hung over our heads with a Damocles sword, threatening to disrupt the launch. <br><br>  Attention!  In order to enable recognition in Russian, you must select the Russian language in the settings of your account in the Evernote web client (‚ÄúSettings‚Äù link).  In this case, the recognition of English words will also be preserved. <br><br>  The video gives a basic idea of ‚Äã‚Äãhow it works and why it is needed. <br><br><iframe width="420" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/rZXFTHmwmRQ%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700022,15700186,15700191,15700253,15700256,15700259&amp;usg=ALkJrhh6BRj4V3hC04jfVAywFdFApIX2zg" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  <b>Evernote main features</b> <br><br>  ‚Ä¢ Convenient tools for creating notes, including text entries, web pages, to-do list, shopping list, photos, pictures, e-mail, etc .; <br><br>  ‚Ä¢ automatic synchronization and access to notes from the web, from a desktop or mobile phone; <br><br>  ‚Ä¢ Sort notes by attributes and tags; <br><br>  ‚Ä¢ filters for quick search of notes, including name, date, tags, picture presence, etc. The search also uses text recognition in images (this is our unique technology); <br><br>  ‚Ä¢ bookmark / add-on in the browser (Internet Explorer, Firefox, Safari, Opera, Chrome, etc.) to save selected text to the notes, the entire web page, as well as create quick entries; <br><br>  ‚Ä¢ the possibility of opening public access to individual notebooks; <br><br>  ‚Ä¢ Geotagging notes, are made using GPS and allow you to find notes "taken within a radius of several kilometers." <br><br>  We will be very grateful for the feedback on the service and the site, on the quality of localization.  Any questions will be answered with pleasure.  :) <br><br>  In conclusion, a few screenshots. <br><br>  <i>Evernote for Mac</i> <br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/602/83a/acc/60283aacc2b830a5d1e76669b7cf2595.png" width="200" height="120"></a> <br><br>  <i>Web interface</i> <br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/7a0/cf8/413/7a0cf841379646173541d418b1c49dba.jpg" width="200" height="123"></a> <br><br>  <i>Evernote for iPhone</i> <br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/162/903/dca/162903dcaaf1cef8c5e3d072574770f8.jpg" width="100" height="150"></a> <br><br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/5d4/112/cc7/5d4112cc77f53665181208f910efe21d.jpg" width="100" height="150"></a> <br><br>  You can also follow our news and chat with us on <a href="http://twitter.com/evernote_ru/">twitter.com/evernote_ru</a> , and on a more ‚Äúofficial‚Äù corporate blog: <a href="http://blog.evernote.com/ru/">blog.evernote.com/ru</a> . </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/56236/">https://habr.com/ru/post/56236/</a></p>
