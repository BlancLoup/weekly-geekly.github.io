  <section class="page js-page"><h1>AppStore perodolemark 10,000 applications. How will this help the Android Market?</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  The Apple iPhone Store now has about 10,000 titles available for download.  If you look at the number of applications in the Android Market, the comparison is clearly not in favor of the latter.  The Android Market has just over 460 apps.  The AppStore opened on July 11, while the Android Market was launched only in October.  Practically from the moment of launch and until now, they often write in the blogosphere, they say, the Android Market will overtake the AppStore as well as in quantity and quality. <br>  However, for some reason this does not happen and we do not observe an explosive growth in the number of applications. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  First, let's pay tribute to Apple and the iPhone.  I hope Android fans understand that the success and experience of the iPhone can be used for the benefit of Android.  After all, let's not be cunning, but Apple with its iPhone raised the bar high enough and you need to put a lot of effort to conquer this bar, and even more so to exceed.  Recently, Apple has published a list of its most popular download applications.  If I were a developer for Android, I would pay close attention to this list and determine which type of applications have the greatest potential.  This is a kind of market research. <br><br>  Although Android and iPhone have their own differences, yet their main value - providing users with a central selection of links for downloading the right applications - is almost identical.  The iPhone is several months ahead of Android in the life cycle of applications, and Android developers can use this as a guide to achieving similar success and avoid such failures. <br><br>  Apple has published a list of top applications - paid and free in all key categories.  If you look at the top ten paid and free applications, you can draw a few conclusions.  Of the 10 top applications, 6 turned out to be games.  It is also important that the low cost of this score also played an important role.  Meanwhile, if you look at the top ten free applications, we will see clients for popular social networks and services.  Similar programs already have Android. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/d23/ca3/b8f/d23ca3b8f3f9948f1ac29d24a6cbae96.jpg" alt="image"><br>  I bet that after the beginning of 2009 there will be an opportunity to publish paid applications in the Android Market we will see a huge influx of new games.  Why should developers release their programs now for free, when in a couple of months they will be able to make a HUGE profit, and with the prospect of getting into the top ten paid applications?

      Now if you look at the quality of programs in the AppStore, then you can see that quite a lot of applications are ‚Äútrash‚Äù, they are written, it‚Äôs just a feeling.  On the one hand, this is a minus of iPhone popularity.  By and large, it is no secret that many developers write the best programs not for money.  The idea and enthusiasm are the main components of open source.  But if the material component is added, isn‚Äôt this the secret of a quality program for any platform? <br><br>  And in the end ... this is a marathon ... Apple's operating system is limited only to the iPhone, however, the number of applications for it is incredibly impressive, but the fact is: The OHA (Open Handset Alliance) Association, which includes many global manufacturing companies, supports Android  And because I do not see the point in the opinion that Apple can get ahead of Android in areas such as the number of applications released and their quality for a long time.  We can not talk about rivalry in its direct sense, rather it is a parallel development of Google and Apple.  And who will be able to offer the end user more high-quality content, only time will tell. <br><br>  I would like to add that this is only my IMHO. <br><br>  PS <br>  The latest news about Android can be read on <a href="http://googlephones.ru/">googlephones.ru</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/47008/">https://habr.com/ru/post/47008/</a></p>
