And since it has become fashionable, people pay attention not only to the resolution of the main camera, but also to the front one.  In the end, it was not for nothing that the British declared ‚Äúselfies‚Äù the word of the year in 2013, and 2014 became the unspoken year of self portraits.  As a manufacturer of gadgets, we cannot ignore such a trend, and therefore we have released our self-bonding equipment - Lenovo S90.  It is about him today and want to tell you. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Of course, the marketing people and developers from the central office, of course, didn‚Äôt orient themselves to those who make selfies. They represented S90 users as follows: young people, not geeks.  And we in Moscow are in complete agreement with such positioning.  You must admit that it is difficult to imagine young people who do not like to have a good rest or just have fun spending their free time.  And it is not so important what is meant by this: there are thousands of options, and in many of them it is not necessary to be an extrovert.  And along the way, why not take a picture for memory? <br><br>  Taking into account the set criteria, the appearance of the S90 should have been such that it was pleasant to take a smartphone in hands, put it on a table in a cafe, show it to friends.  The idea seems to be quite successful: the design of the device is very actively discussed in many resources and forums.  We have already read about comparisons and analogies and are not fully integrated on this topic.

      Monolithic body of brushed aluminum looks beautiful under any lighting.  Our colleagues from China also completed the package with a protective bumper cover.  We fully approve of such a decision, because if someone seems to be sliding metal, then the accessory will help out.  Well, the developers tried to reduce the weight with dimensions to a reasonable minimum: they turned out 129 grams with a screen diagonal of 5 inches and a thickness of 6.9 mm. <br><br>  The Lenovo S90 uses Samsung's Super AMOLED matrix with a resolution of 1280x720 pixels.  In our opinion, this choice gives the user many advantages compared to IPS: deep black, high contrast and good readability under direct light sources.  At the same time, the PPI index for an HD screen is quite high: nearly 300 pixels per inch.  Individual points can be distinguished, but only if you look at the picture very closely and closely.  You probably already guessed about the color coverage yourself - the range is traditionally wide for AMOLED.  Most users like saturated colors, but we cannot deny the fact that there are also quite a few supporters of a low-key balance. <br><br>  Lenovo S90 is not a gaming smartphone, but it definitely does not fall into the category of low-power ones.  The Qualcomm Snapdragon 410 (MSM8916) chipset is such a golden mean, perhaps even with a plus.  It uses 4 processor cores (Cortex-A52) with a clock speed of 1.2 GHz and a graphics accelerator Adreno 306. Plus, a substantial supply of RAM is 2 GB.  In principle, experienced users simply seeing these words and numbers are unlikely to argue with the fact that some serious problems when working with the interface, browser, mail, cameras and while watching a video are unlikely.  Here, by the way, it is appropriate to say a few kind words to the developers of our <a href="http://geektimes.ru/company/lenovo/blog/244522/">Vibe UI</a> shell, who never forget about the important word ‚Äúoptimization‚Äù. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/918/487/7ca/9184877cae514d9d8e7c3280afc2e8d8.jpg"><br><br>  Support for Russian LTE frequencies certified for sale in the territory of the Russian Federation S90, of course, is.  Many already simply can not live without fast mobile Internet, and we understand them perfectly.  Another advantage of the S90 is the ability to use two SIM cards.  Even if you have only one number, it still remains a plus.  During a vacation or business trip in another country, it can definitely come in handy - here you cannot guess. <br><br>  The amount of permanent memory in the modification for the Russian market is fixed - 32 GB, of which the Android 4.4.4 system and pre-installed applications occupy around 7 GB.  The remaining, as it seems to us, will be enough for all cases, except, perhaps, those when the user is constantly shooting the video.  Although, why argue, a slot for a microSD card would definitely not be superfluous.  But then we immediately announce the good news: Lenovo S90 is listed in the list of devices that will receive an upgrade to Android 5.0 in the very near future with an absolute probability. <br><br>  The resolution of the main camera of the Lenovo S90, as well as, for example, in the Vibe X2, is 13 megapixels, but we decided to use the new module from OmniVision.  Formally, it is not ‚Äútop-end‚Äù, but in fact it allows you to get great shots, which is greatly facilitated by the PureCel noise reduction technology.  We like the results, but the pictures will speak much better than words. <br><br> <a href="http://http:https:"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/6d2/5d2/ef3/6d25d2ef3f4e4ab596f348cf289e2c30.jpg"></a> <br><br> <a href="http://http:https:"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/0dc/507/b95/0dc507b95f624361af558be20eab3cd5.jpg"></a> <br><br> <a href="http://http:https:"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/e8e/7fe/ba8/e8e7feba826f48b880027a3c2453e8d5.jpg"></a> <br><br> <a href="http://http:https:"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/fe9/fc9/a96/fe9fc9a9692f4022b06c1e657a1cd039.jpg"></a> <br><br>  And at the mercy of automation given not all processes.  The user is free to choose a white balance preset, change the ISO value and even switch between the two methods of metering exposure.  Of course, it was not without HDR, built-in filters and panoramic mode.  For those who have problems with a collapsed horizon, there is an electronic level. <br><br>  And finally, the most interesting, our pride is the front camera with a resolution of 8 megapixels and a built-in flash.  Not every flagship has this, although it is probably a matter of time.  However, anyway, with S90 you will make really good selfies without any ‚Äúbuts‚Äù.  In daylight, everything will be absolutely wonderful, but even in the pitch darkness, a ‚Äúshot‚Äù of the frontal flash will add some grain, but still you will have great photos, while your friends with other smartphones will only envy and ask for the frame. <br><br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/eb4/361/72d/eb436172d16d42dcb447437f4c132812.jpg"></a> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/de8/e83/4a3/de8e834a337a4ef5be0e480e54087a5a.jpg"></a> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/fe8/d70/f08/fe8d70f084fc4a2a9a178c9381979f8c.jpg"></a> <br><br>  By the way, the user can make the black border of the Camera application interface pink or yellow, thus providing additional lighting.  And when shooting, the fill ‚Äúspreads out‚Äù on the whole screen, plus it is possible to slightly adjust the color temperature of the image.  Also included in the ‚Äúbundle‚Äù is a skin smoothing mode for girls and as many as 5 options for remote shutter release. <br><br>  As for the battery, inside the smartphone is a battery with a capacity of 2300 mAh, and one full charge on average is enough for a day of work.  On sale gadget appeared literally the other day.  And here at once we want to warn you against buying a ‚Äúseryaka.‚Äù  The S90 prices in small stores are ‚Äúdelicious‚Äù, but the devices there are from the Chinese market: with 16 GB of memory, only a gigabyte of RAM and other LTE frequencies.  Be carefull!  Well, or just know in advance what you agree to;  ) And if there are questions, then we, as always, will be happy to answer them. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/365193/">https://habr.com/ru/post/365193/</a></p>
