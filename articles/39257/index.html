    <h4>  Exploitation of stereotypes </h4><br>  The overwhelming majority of those who have encountered Saul note that it is very difficult to work with the program primarily psychologically.  Many because of this program throw.  And many, you know like.  In these people, a well-known "professional masochism" works, when a person is so depressed at work that he himself convinces himself that it is useful for him (hello to office plankton). <br>  Once again the exploitation of the stereotype of the form: <br>  Since expensive is good, <br>  once unpleasant - it means useful. <br><br>  But all this would be a trifle, if not for the rational and objective reasons for this displeasure. <br><br><h4>  Human factor </h4><br>  On the pages between the exercises, the doctor with an ingratiating, slightly indulgent voice tells us that everything will be fine, that they will cure us, make us a <s>real</s> person who owns the method of blind ten-finger dialing.  It would seem that there is nothing strange in it - the doctor came to help us.  However, for some reason we feel akin to a political prisoner of the 70s who were sent to psychiatric hospitals, "so as not to say nonsense."  Imagine, you are sitting there normal <s>in front of the monitor</s> , and with you as if you are mad.  Unpleasant ... <br>  (and some have associations with the army, when a soldier is given a spade / mop / trowel and is loaded with household / construction work all day, explaining that this is a combat task, and it is honorable and very patriotic to do it). <br><br>  And well, if this feeling was false, but ... <br><br><h4>  Technique </h4><br>  ... but the program itself contains several gross methodological errors, which is why working with it is at most a monkey job, which is intuitively felt by most users.  I'll show you now ;-) <br><h5>  And by the way, how does the brain work? </h5><br>  The human brain, unlike a computer, where each memory cell is independent of others, and the execution of processor commands almost does not depend on their history (except status registers), works quite the opposite: every object or phenomenon is memorized and analyzed in the environment of all relevant phenomena and objects, and <b>each skill is formed and fixed in the environment relevant skills and states</b> . <br><br>  There is no ‚Äúskill of typing the letter o‚Äù, but there are skills of typing letter combinations -pn, -n-o-, -s-l-o-, etc. <br>  Similarly, there is no in itself the skill of printing a letter combination, but there is the skill of printing a letter combination surrounded by other letter combinations. <br>  And the skill of printing a single word either.  Each word in print (and reflection) is associated with other words. <br>  <i>(To be convinced of this, those who can print quickly can make an experiment. Take any word that is not too fast and start typing it in a row with a space of about 5-10 copies, you will begin to stumble, even though during normal printing typing text without hesitation with pages or at least with large paragraphs. This proves that the <b>skill of printing connected text and the skill of printing individual syntactic units are different skills</b> , and having one does not mean having another)</i> <br>  At the same time, what are we invited to print in Solo?  -o &lt;space&gt; -o- &lt;space&gt; - <br>  As a result, we have <b>fixed a harmful skill, a harmful conditioned reflex ‚Äúafter o - space‚Äù</b> .  and with further training will have to destroy this reflex. <br>  How often are letter combinations in Russian?  what about oldj?  Here you have another meaningless skill. <br><br>  Another interesting fact.  In the area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe cerebral cortex, which will be responsible for the skill of touch typing, the data are not given by letters, or even by syllables.  They are served there by <b>images</b> .  <b>Natural is the skill of printing what we understand</b> , not gibberish.  For the sake of experiment, try typing a meaningful text and a word that has no meaning (at least for you).  You will see that these are completely different activities. <br><br>  And how often do we have to print many identical letters in a row?  And by printing them in a row in Solo, we create positive feedback in the cerebral cortex, which also in our life will never come in handy and will interfere with practical printing many times, and also training one. <br><br><h5>  And by the way, why am I doing this? </h5><br>  There is such a wonderful thing in the Solo program as an error limit for an exercise ;-) I made more than 5 typos and hello, start over.  No, first read what the doctor says, and then start over.  (i.e., again we are dealing with the monkey labor).  In the days of typewriters, it was vital to type without typos, because they were very difficult to correct.  But we all work on computers.  And looking at the monitor, we immediately see our typo and can fix it.  There is a reasonable question: what is more valuable: to be able to print at a speed of 90 characters per minute with 2% typos, or 320 characters per minute, but at the same time, 3-5% of typographical errors from which all are noticed and corrected? <br><br>  But people are very, very different ... For someone it is easier to reduce the percentage of typos from 5 to 2, and for someone it is easier to raise the speed of your dialing to 300 and these typos will no longer play any significant role, and Solo does not leave a person a choice . <br><br>  In general, people have different tasks.  Someone needs a blind set it is not clear why, someone else for some reason, but someone just to then print.  With normal speed and acceptable purity. <br><br>  I think speed is important ... <br><br><h4>  My personal experience </h4><br>  When I had a desire to learn the ten-finger blind method of recruitment (about 6 years ago), I, like everyone else, got acquainted with the ‚ÄúSolo‚Äù first of all, but it did not give any positive effects, because  even then he was a very clever child, and understood almost everything that I am writing to you about now. <br><br>  And a program developed by a child in one of the Dnipropetrovsk lyceums turned out to be useful and practical, which did not contain any excesses and unnecessary restrictions, but instead of a flush, they offered to type perfectly normal phrases, and later texts.  Even out of the letters of the main row there were made up more than 50 even funny, but meaningful phrases (some I still remember) <br><br>  <i>the cook stole firewood</i> <br>  <i>Ella fell into a rage</i> <br>  <i>Frol broke the wire</i> <br>  <i>the widow was waiting for a reason</i> <br><br>  And no restrictions, just accounting for speed and error statistics. <br><br>  Unfortunately, I can not put this program, because  I do not have the right to publish it, but I cannot find the author. <br><br><h4>  findings </h4><br>  The conclusions are disappointing ... <br><br>  PS Wrote this text, focusing on his memories of the seventh version of Solo, downloaded the ninth version just in case - nothing has changed. <br><br>  PPS And tell Dmitry Mitrofanov that he has a non-reentrant procedure for handling the event of pressing the button ‚Äúcreate a new account‚Äù (such, healthy, green with an arrow like everyone) on the occasion of the previous pressing with all fields empty <br><br>  PPPS Printed blind tenfinger method. <br></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/39257/">https://habr.com/ru/post/39257/</a></p>
