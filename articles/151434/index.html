As a guinea pig - an interview with CEO OZON.RU Mael Gave. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/de9/5d3/e81/de95d3e81edef479b6c08021cb22543e.png" alt="image" align="left">  Ozon, the first Russian e-commerce giant, which started as an online store of books and electronics, but soon expanded to fashionable clothes and logistics services for other companies, often referred to as the Russian version of the Amazon website for appropriate sizes and immodest scope.  But in today's interview with CEO Mael Gave, he argues that it is still too early to compare these two sites.  According to her, despite some tests, Ozon.ru has no current plans on the agenda for developing its own e-books, tablets and other devices. <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  This announcement was made on the same day when Ozon published its six-month results, which show continuous growth: 78% over the past year, that is, more than $ 232 million.  These figures include the valuable February acquisition - a site with shoes and accessories Sapato.ru.  These results seem modest compared to Amazon, which published income data of 12.8 billion dollars for the last quarter.  But now Ozon is developing faster, and Gave points to the fact that Russia still has untapped potential - less than 20% of Russia's population ‚Äúwalks‚Äù shopping online.

      As for other indicators: the number of registered users on Ozon.ru reached 11.1 million, 17.3 million visitors.  These figures include the base of the fashion site Sapato.ru, purchased at the beginning of this year and now, according to Gave, ‚Äúsmoothly‚Äù mixed with Ozon.ru.  The offer on the site has 2.2 million goods, but it will soon grow to 9 million as soon as the second warehouse opens.  Gave argues that income is growing due to the high productivity of all industries - Ozon.ru, Sapato.ru, O-Courier and Ozon.travel - a site for online booking of tickets. <br><br>  <b>Despite the sale of clothing, travel and logistics services, at the moment books and electronics are still the main focus of the site.</b>  <b>(On Ozon.ru, the main percentage of sales is books (34.3%), electronics (34.3%): DVDs, software, games and music, products for children and their parents, sports goods and goods for personal care. , antiques, and some other products).</b>  <b>Will the creators of the Russian site follow in the footsteps of Amazon?</b>  <b>Will sell e-books and tablets?</b> <br><br>  A year ago, we analyzed the Russian market and realized that he was not ready for this yet.  A lot of modern devices are already on the Russian market (considering the recent attempt to create a Russian OS-tablet), so we focused on something else.  The digital market in Russia is not like the American.  Piracy still flourishes here, and many publishers still do not have digital rights.  That is, this market is still in the making, and still too small. <br><br>  But we constantly pay attention to different possibilities and continue to ensure that site content is available on all interfaces (for example, through applications for iOS, Android and Samsung), because we believe that there will be enough devices on the market to use it. <br><br>  After 6-12 months, the situation may change.  We try to be present at each forum, but when it comes to creating our own product, we cannot yet say anything definite. <br><br>  <b>What about cloud computing services or Amazon Web Service equivalent?</b>  <b>Any plans?</b> <br><br>  This is a very good question, although it is still very early to talk about it.  We are going to analyze a lot of different functions in the next 12-18 months.  But not a word about it anymore: in France there is a saying ‚ÄúDo not sell the bear's skin until you have killed him.‚Äù <br><br>  <b>What about logistics?</b>  <b>In Russia, we see many examples of e-commerce - KupiVIP and Lamonda - which created their own distribution of services, partly due to the lack of existing infrastructure, and now sell their services to third parties.</b>  <b>And I see that now you have 2100 points in Russia and Kazakhstan.</b> <br><br>  Since we are well invested in infrastructure and logistics, we can now offer our services to third parties.  We already have 70 small wholesale specialists working at the outlet, but we have not yet begun to increase the volume.  Our difference from KupiVIP is that we work not only with famous fashion brands.  This part of our business is developing well: we expect that the majority of stocks passing through our system will soon be from third parties. <br><br>  <b>What about the initial public offering?</b> <br><br>  This is definitely not on the agenda right now.  It's too early for us.  We are too focused on the growth of the company, the main thing for us is to achieve high growth rates.  We earned 100 million dollars last year and now we have to do a lot to declare ourselves internationally. <br><br>  <b>And what is the international strategy?</b> <br><br>  Like other Russian e-commerce companies, we are following the example of the neighboring republics, but here in Russia there is a very big potential - only 20% of the people in Russia buy goods via the Internet.  Now the growth of international rights is not our main goal, as this will mean less focusing on development within the country. <br><br>  <b>What about valuable acquisitions?</b>  <b>Will there be new Sapato?</b> <br><br>  Our plans began to grow since we earned $ 100 million (Ozon.ru investors are Baring Vostok Private Equity, Index Ventures and ru-Net Ltd, as well as Rakuten, Intel Capital, Holtzbrinck and Cisco).  The problem is that there are not so many goals.  We never found anything worthwhile to invest.  If we find the same type of company as Sapato.ru, with the same potential, we will definitely make friends with it.  But so far we have not found anything worthwhile. <br><br>  Reference to the original article: <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/09/04/ozon-russian-amazon-result/">techcrunch.com/2012/09/04/ozon-russian-amazon-result</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/151434/">https://habr.com/ru/post/151434/</a></p>
