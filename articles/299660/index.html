Accordingly, they open letters, click on links and make purchases.

      In addition, CTLV (Customer LifeTime Value) customers who shop from mailings are 12% above average. <br><br><blockquote>  Therefore, it is not at all surprising that the average return on investment in Email Marketing is $ 44.25 for every dollar invested. </blockquote><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Sounds cool, right? <br><br>  If you are already inspired by these numbers, look at which mailings are the most profitable for an online store: <br><br><h4>  1. A reminder of the "abandoned basket." </h4><br><br>  According to the Baymard Institute, an average of 67% of the baskets remain abandoned.  In other words, 67 customers out of 100 browse through the pages of your site, add products to the cart, go to the checkout page ... <br><br>  And go a step away from the purchase. <br><br>  It turns out that if you sell $ 2,000,000 a year, you lose another $ 4,000,000 in abandoned baskets. <br><br><h5>  How to setup. </h5><br><br>  <i>Letter number 1. Just remind about the unfinished order.</i> <br><br>  <i>Dispatch time: within 1 hour.</i> <br><br>  Many companies add discounts, gifts in the first letter.  Customers are aware of this and can throw the cart on purpose to get a discount and buy cheaper. <br><br>  In the first letter, it is enough just to remind about the ‚Äúabandoned‚Äù order, add photos of the product, its description, the advantages of buying it in your store and the button ‚ÄúReturn to purchases‚Äù. <br><br>  <i>Letter number 2. Fighting objections.</i> <i><br><br></i>  <i>Dispatch time: 24 hours.</i> <br><br>  Why the client did not place an order?  - If you do not know the answer to this question, ask him about it. <br><br>  Add a few questions to the letter about what went wrong?  What did not work / do not understand? <br><br>  Even if you don‚Äôt succeed in getting your customer back for buying it, you‚Äôll get valuable information about where your weak points are and what needs to be corrected. <br><br>  <i>Letter number 3. Time to give gifts.</i> <i><br><br></i>  <i>Shipment Time: After 3 days</i> <br><br>  The customer needs a push, you need to carefully push him to buy.  Send a 5% or 10% discount (or as much as your margin allows). <br><br>  A series of 3 letters is not a panacea.  There are companies that send 7 reminder letters about an abandoned basket.  Why so much?  - They conducted testing and it turned out that for them this is the most optimal amount, which brings the highest conversion. <br><br><h5>  A few examples‚Ä¶ </h5><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/megamozg/post_images/312/a71/dbf/312a71dbf7500065f55b7e0f3ce5981b.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/megamozg/post_images/8f8/23c/86f/8f823c86fda81fe4ea3966e55b9f9739.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/megamozg/post_images/10c/81c/2e2/10c81c2e2db0fa927d7d01302830e8c4.png" alt="image"><br><br><h4>  2. Welcome letters after registration. </h4><br><br>  Did you know that 74.4% of customers are waiting for a welcome letter after registration?  In addition, customers who have received such a letter are 33% more loyal to the company. <br><br><h5>  How to setup. </h5><br><br>  Welcome letters can have the following tasks: <br><br><ol><li>  Greeting </li><li>  Introduce Your Brand </li><li>  Give customer incentive </li><li>  Share future plans </li><li>  Attract customers to communicate through other channels (except email) </li></ol><br><br>  <i>Greeting.</i>  The most simple and familiar to all email.  You just write to the customer "Welcome." <br><br>  <i>Acquaintance with the brand.</i>  An excellent opportunity to tell the story of the creation of your company, features or traditions of doing business and, why customers choose you. <br><br>  The main thing is to focus on what sets you apart from the crowd. <br><br>  <i>Stimulus.</i>  If you have promised the client a bonus, for the entered email - send it in this letter.  If the gift was educational content, attach a book, infographic, etc. to this letter. <br><br>  <i>Future plans.</i>  Surely you want the client to continue reading letters from you.  It's time to tell him about what kind of newsletter you plan to send him, what useful he will receive from you in the future. <br><br>  Other channels of communication.  How about being friends on social networks?  Offer the client to subscribe to your group Vkontakte, Facebook, Instagram, etc. <br><br><h4>  A few examples‚Ä¶ </h4><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/megamozg/post_images/80c/2fe/bf8/80c2febf87fbbf0673b72fa6c02ffe18.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/megamozg/post_images/7ca/5c6/d09/7ca5c6d093d34a5c10fd83425a135edb.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/megamozg/post_images/41f/84d/f04/41f84df04bccf348c098b263c4561f59.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><h4>  3. Useful content. </h4><br><br>  The client will never make a purchase that is imposed on him, while he happily spends money when he decides to buy something. <br><br>  Online stores that heat up their customers with useful content, 50% more often bring the customer to purchase.  In addition, the average check of such ‚Äúheated‚Äù customers is 47% higher. <br><br>  Rule 3/47/50 reads: <br><br><ol><li>  3% of visitors are ready to make a purchase immediately. </li><li>  47: Visitors are not ready to buy right now, but will do so in the future. </li><li>  50% of visitors will never buy anything from you </li></ol><br><br>  Most online stores are concentrated and live at the expense of purchases of these same 3%.  It turns out that out of 100 people who come to the site - 3 make a purchase and this is enough for shops.  They simply increase the amount of traffic. <br><br>  It turns out that with such a strategy, you lose 47 potential customers just because you do not bring them to the purchase using useful content and email marketing. <br><br><h5>  How to setup. </h5><br><br>  Send to customers: <br><br><ol><li>  Educational videos </li><li>  Interesting articles </li><li>  Secrets of the manufacturer </li><li>  Tips and tricks </li><li>  Online tests </li></ol><br><br>  For example, the online store of Leesa Sleep mattresses, send letters to their customers about: <br><br>  TO <ol><li>  How to choose the right mattress? </li><li> What threatens to sleep on a bad mattress in a 10-year term? </li><li>  Choosing the right pillow for a healthy sleep. </li><li>  Famous "Larks" </li><li>  Sleep Lab.  What sleep is considered the most effective and helps to restore the body? </li></ol><br><br>  No one knows your product better than you.  Train customers, help them understand complex product categories. <br><br><h5>  A few examples‚Ä¶ </h5><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/megamozg/post_images/a2c/eb9/0ab/a2ceb90abf05fdbc1813136ce61c6d29.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/megamozg/post_images/3af/4b6/a31/3af4b6a315c0155914c2408dd63cd900.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><h4>  4. Email to a new buyer. </h4><br><br>  Hooray!  You have a new customer.  Now you can relax and stop writing letters to him?  - In no case, if you want him to buy from you again. <br><br>  This is a crucial moment in your relationship.  If you screw up, the customer will never return to you for shopping. <br><br><blockquote>  Bare numbers.  It is 10 times more expensive to attract a new client than to sell something to someone who already bought from you.  In addition, regular customers buy 67% more than new ones. </blockquote><br><br><br><h5>  How to setup. </h5><br><br>  <i>Letter number 1. Thank you for purchasing from us.</i> <br><br>  Send this email immediately after ordering.  In this letter, tell the customer details of his order, delivery time, return and exchange conditions. <br><br>  By the way, just the right time to offer related products.  Add a small block with product recommendations to the letter footer. <br><br>  <i>Letter number 2. Is everything in order?</i> <br><br>  Send it in 3 days.  Just ask the client how are you doing, did he get all the necessary information about his order? <br><br>  Very often sellers ignore customers at this crucial moment after placing an order, do not be one of them ... <br><br>  If something went wrong, ask the client to write about it immediately in response to your letter. <br><br>  <i>Letter number 3. Have you already received your order?</i> <br><br>  Ask the customer whether the ordered product came to him a few days after the expected delivery date.  Just make sure that the goods are delivered safe and sound. <br><br>  <i>Letter number 4. Ask for a review on this product.</i> <br><br>  After another 3 days, just ask the customer to share their impressions about the product. <br><br>  <i>Letter number 5. Bonus to the next purchase.</i> <br><br>  Send the customer an offer of super-advantage to buy something from the same product category that he purchased earlier. Be sure to limit the offer by the time of action.  Send this email 4 days after the request to leave a review. <br><br>  <i>Letter number 6. The bonus expires today.</i> <br><br>  A reminder letter that the special offer expires today.  The client should hurry up in time to use it.  Send this letter the next day after the previous one. <br><br><h5>  A few examples‚Ä¶ </h5><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/megamozg/post_images/512/30e/836/51230e8364eef33e21c043ca93853f97.png" alt="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/megamozg/post_images/afb/ace/7bb/afbace7bb972d6d1fb5c1c5503dc27bf.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/megamozg/post_images/e1f/3f2/296/e1f3f2296fc11d883c05324b27aced19.png" alt="image"><br><br><h4>  5. Involving inactive customers. </h4><br><br>  Over time, customers get tired of your letters.  They stop opening them, stop clicking ... then stop buying. <br><br>  This campaign aims to return such customers. <br><br><blockquote>  You want to sell more, right?  But besides this, you want to show Gmail and other mail clients that people really want to receive your letters. </blockquote><br><br><br>  In other words, if a large part of your subscriber base does not show any activity, it is more likely that you will get into the SPAM folder. <br><br><h5>  How to setup. </h5><br><br>  There are a few simple rules: <br><br><ol><li>  Start your letter with the phrase ‚ÄúWe miss ...‚Äù or ‚ÄúWhere have you gone?‚Äù </li><li>  Add an offer you cannot refuse </li><li>  Write that you will unsubscribe them from your mailing list if they do not show any activity. </li><li>  Remove them from your subscriber database. </li></ol><br><br>  <i>Letter No. 1. We miss ...</i> <br><br>  Add a sad kitten or puppy to this letter, it works :) <br><br>  <i>Letter number 2. Big discount.</i> <br><br>  It's time for the last attempt.  Send the customer the biggest discount you can afford.  Here, either all or nothing. <br><br>  <i>Letter number 3. I will remove you from our base in X days.</i> <br><br>  Politely warn the client that if he does not open your letter or make a purchase within the next 7 days, you will delete it from your subscriber database and say goodbye to him forever. <br><br>  Be sure to remind about the super bid that was sent earlier. <br><br>  <i>Letter number 4. I wrote to you from our mailing list.</i> <br><br>  Notify the customer that you have unsubscribed.  At the same time, once again remind you of the special offer and that he can still use it. <br><br>  Just add the button ‚ÄúSubscribe again‚Äù, in case the client decided to return to you. <br><br><h5>  A few examples‚Ä¶ </h5><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/megamozg/post_images/21e/41c/b8b/21e41cb8bd0264a2e9abaace79d18c8a.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/megamozg/post_images/8e0/3a8/f70/8e03a8f707e278e6615b15fd015bf848.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/megamozg/post_images/e8c/335/f7e/e8c335f7ea70188804f1fff1f5c869cc.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Now you are ready to create cool trigger ezines. <br><br>  Successes! </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/299660/">https://habr.com/ru/post/299660/</a></p>
