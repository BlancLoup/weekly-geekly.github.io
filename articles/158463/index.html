  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Advertising bubble: show must go on! We are the creators of the history of the Internet</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  I propose to recall the not so distant past: <br><blockquote>  The dot-com bubble is an economic bubble that existed from about 1995 to 2001.  The climax occurred on March 10, 2000, when the NASDAQ index reached 5,132.52 points during trading and fell to 5048.62 at closing. <br><br>  The bubble was formed as a result of the rise of shares of Internet companies (mainly American), as well as the emergence of a large number of new Internet companies and the reorientation of old companies to Internet business at the end of the 20th century.  Shares of companies that offered to use the Internet to generate income, fabulously soared in price.  Such high prices justified numerous commentators and economists who argued that the ‚Äúnew economy‚Äù had begun, but in fact these new business models were ineffective, and funds spent mainly on advertising and large loans led to a wave of bankruptcies, a sharp drop in the index. NASDAQ, as well as the collapse of prices for server computers. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h6>  Root causes: </h6><br>  If we discard the superficial and obvious reasons mentioned above (comments on the "new economy", investing investor‚Äôs funds in advertising and marketing instead of business development), we can single out the true cause of the collapse.  It consists in the fact that by efforts of both not entirely clean businessmen and enthusiastic apologists for the new economy, in the minds of investors and creators of the dot-com there was a change of concepts: doing business through the Internet is only a tool for carrying out a business process, but not an independent business process able to generate income from invested capital. </blockquote><br>  <a href="http://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25CF%25F3%25E7%25FB%25...%25EA%25EE%25EC%25EE%25E2">ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%CF%F3%E7%FB%...%EA%EE%EC%EE%E2</a> <br><br>  And pay attention to a brief news from a series of <a href="http://roem.ru/2012/11/07/akar3q56445/">boring reports</a> : <br><blockquote>  The Association of Communication Agencies of Russia estimated the third quarter results for the advertising market, which is much less turbulent than the same period last year. <br>  Runet companies, announcing their own financial performance this year, and especially in the third quarter, noted a slowdown in market growth.  At the same time, for <i>some reason</i> , several experts (and Mail.Ru management) have slowed down the growth of media advertising for an outflow of budgets on TV. </blockquote>

      I see in all this some kind of similarity of processes.  Now a lot of money goes to the black ‚Äúadvertising‚Äù market, goes away for nothing, is simply stolen from advertisers.  Pay for impressions on websites for twisted indicators, which no one actually looks for, traffic that actually does not exist, which at best pops up an extra tab, and often <a href="http://www.xiki.us/index.php%3Ftitle%3D%25D0%25A2%25...%2584%25D0%25B8%25D0%25BA">gene traf</a> in general, in simple terms, something like a weak DDoS botnet. <br><br>  Particularly impressive is the hypocritical ‚ÄúPurpose: White: to increase the attendance of a legal site, or cheat the popularity rating or the number of ad impressions.  Often advertisers pay for ad impressions. ‚Äù <br><br>  Are there many benefits to the advertiser from such a ‚Äúwhite‚Äù application? <br>  <b>Advertisers pay for air</b> , and this is called white appointment. <br>  Advertisers' money is going nowhere.  More precisely in the wallets of hacker chains.  Real money, which advertisers pay, and which give too little effect, except for the inflated indicators of the soap-trap bubble.  By the way, this is a lot of money.  There is a whole industry of underground black Seo, affiliate programs, which bring in a very rather large income, and are considered to be one of the safest ways to honestly take money from the population. <br><br>  As in the case of the dot-com bubble, the swelling of the bubble trap was made possible by the substitution of concepts.  The Internet should <b>bring real benefits to</b> both ordinary users and businesses, and not to be especially unwanted unproductive entertainment for chatting clerks and housewives.  And for this, it must be <b>safe and informative</b> .  It is then that he will be able to generate income from invested capital (servers, websites, stores, advertising, software development).  It is when people begin to buy, make deals, pay for services, save their time thanks to portals (public and private) services, the Internet will become a real and essential tool for carrying out business processes, and not promoted by romantics and speculators as another funnel for pumping money from advertisers. <br><br>  Take the simplest example: online shopping.  In addition to the extremely low efficiency of online advertising, which costs money and should pay off, online shopping and marketplaces account for about half of DDoS.  And this is again expenses, and expenses are rather big, especially if the owner failed to find an intelligent administrator and had to turn to the so-called ‚Äúdefenders‚Äù.  Services which are prohibitively expensive, but there are cheaper.  At one of the closed hacker forums, one of these ‚Äúcheaper‚Äù offers DDoS services: ‚Äúwe set the serv of any complexity‚Äù.  Well, we defend, of course (on the white site), to whom you need to contact. <br><br>  Thus, the activity of online stores becomes unprofitable or unprofitable, and as a result, only the strongest (richest) will survive in this situation, there will be no flourishing of small and medium-sized businesses on the Internet.  In the end, the Internet can remain only a hundred of the largest sites like Google-contact-cloud supermarket-site president-newspaper Pravda.  All the rest will be unprofitable due to the exorbitant costs of anti-evil antidos.  To entertain the bored population, google blogs with gaming android applications are enough. <br><br>  Sounds frighteningly implausible?  Leading Internet companies and analysts are looking to the future with optimism and predict only growth?  See the quote: <br><br><blockquote>  The collapse of the dotcoms was a loss of confidence in the securities of high-tech firms associated with the provision of services via the Internet.  This was due on the one hand to a significant revaluation of the so-called.  post-industrial technologies, which in practice did not live up to the expectations attributed to them, on the other hand, there were uncontrolled speculations on these expectations, which many times increased the negative effect of a fall in confidence.  In fact, the whole service sector has ceased to exist, the demand and the value of which turned out to be exaggerated.  This was accompanied by the ruin of thousands of firms and companies of various levels, mostly newly formed ones. <br>  <b>Incompetence in economic issues of</b> the investors themselves was caused by intensive processing of public opinion, which was convincing of the emergence of a new ‚Äúafter‚Äù industrial era, which <b>allegedly canceled any requirements for the availability of real productive resources for economic activity.</b>  <b>Thus, the information superstructure was issued for the entire economic mechanism.</b> <br>  Many technologically suspended experts, such as programmers, are faced with a sated labor market.  Jokes about programmers returning to study to an accountant or lawyer were popular. </blockquote><br><br>  Isn't it very similar to our current situation?  Pink dreams of the rapid development of business on the Internet, speculative warming up of these dreams, exaggerated traffic and false ratings, and extremely low efficiency for the business of the advertiser. <br><br>  <i>Any far-fetched, exaggerated value, such as virtual games</i> for hacking-protection, vulnerability-patches, ddos-antidos, advertising campaigns and ratings, one way or another will collapse under the weight of inefficiency and no one needs.  Such games in themselves do not benefit mankind, but are only a burden on the economy, and if this bolivar is able to endure one, it will not bear the three. <br><br>  Neither the state nor the system-forming Internet giants struggle and practically do not interfere in any way with living a real threat to the development of the Internet - <b>cybercrime</b> . <br><habracut text=" "><br>  The efficiency of the departments K is almost zero.  Despite the fact that they recently <a href="http://www.ib-bank.ru/bis/a/177">reported loudly</a> about the "long-awaited breakthrough in the fight against" high-tech "crime," I ask you to note that only 8 members were caught, and the "leaders" were boys 83 and 86 years of age.  And the state spent for this: for 2 years, God knows how many employee hours, which cost God how much taxpayers money. <br>  Even the <a href="http://www.cnews.ru/top/2012/11/12/aeroflot_ne_poluchit_millionov_za_ddosataku_509338">dismantling of the business giants</a> , Aeroflot and VTB 24 with the participation of the FSB led to nothing (could not bring to justice, find a real customer, prove the guilt). <br><br>  The backbone Internet giants either wash their hands or play games themselves. <br><br><h4>  How is Yandex. </h4><br>  Yandex believes that the search engine should index (and advertise in this way) everything, including hacker, spam, docer, hacking services and websites that distribute malicious software. <br><br>  However, he allows complaining about search spam and promises to react.  Especially for selfish reasons, as usual.  Because as soon as a certain amount of garbage is exceeded, the very meaning of the existence of Yandex is lost.  Well, in fact, who will use the search, which gives only spam on the first pages? <br><br>  But nevertheless, Yandex itself kindly provides a whole list of sites for the request " <b>generator of doorway downloads</b> ". <br><br>  Personally, Yandex offered me a choice of download: Umax Doorway Generator, Red button transformer, JakoDorgen PRO, PandoraBox, Dynamic Door, red.buttonxrum.  And also my attention is invited to the mass of sites that teach the construction of doorways, inviting affiliate substitution programs, etc., and so on, from the mass of free articles to inexpensive trainings, with the prospect of leaving in private to closed forums and earning real money. <br><br>  In addition, the generator doorways wormed even in <b>Yandex.Direct</b> .  Along with heat guns and diesel generators, Yandex.Direct in its column literally yesterday offered me: <br><br><blockquote>  New doorway generator <br>  Simple, convenient, fast and most importantly very cheap.  Come in to find out! <br>  _getred button.  * com </blockquote><br><br>  <i>Service at the highest level.</i>  <i>Yandex fights spam with one hand, with the other hand carefully and kindly gives out <b>fishing rods</b> to everyone.</i> <br><br>  One of the latest sensational stories about paid subscriptions MTS little bit covered here. <br>  I will cite one <a href="http://www.pvsm.ru/informatsionnaya-bezopasnost/18736">quote</a> : <br><blockquote>  In my opinion, there are signs of a violation of the law in MTS actions, but I am not a lawyer, and I cannot clearly state what exactly they are violating.  The fact is that they <b>carried the criminal component to outsourcing</b> themselves, as it were, not during business.  Specific fraud facts are handled by applications using PhoneClick.  At the same time, it is impossible to determine who exactly is responsible for fraud (the application developer or the developer of PhoneClick) without decompiling and reverse engineering.  <b>Each of the participants in this scheme separately does not commit acts that entail a full-scale corpus delicti.</b>  <b>The crime is committed as a result of the cumulative action of the participants who are not familiar with each other, and it is almost impossible to catch them by the hand.</b> </blockquote><br><br>  I fully support the author. <br><br>  The same can be said about all criminal activity on the Internet. <br><br>  The hoster provides the criminal with hosting, not requiring documents and not wanting to know what happens to him, thus supplying the criminal with the necessary ‚Äúmeans of production‚Äù, but he is not in the business either.  Should not, has no right to interfere, know, look, etc. <br><br>  Yandex advertises and delivers in this way criminal content to potential criminals, but it‚Äôs just a search engine, and also, as it were, not during business.  Should not, is not eligible. <br><br>  Reg.ru refuses to close domains, as he is just a registrar, and also, no matter how.  He <a href="http://www.rbcdaily.ru/2012/11/12/media/562949985111860">refuses</a> to even provide information about the <a href="http://www.rbcdaily.ru/2012/11/12/media/562949985111860">admin domain</a> , because  attention: someone gave him the right to cover criminals.  Who was that?  Freedom of the internet? <br><br>  Yandex has the right to hide and not disclose completely the conditions of ratings and issuances.  But it has no right to remove anything from the issue. <br><br>  <i><b>And no one is specifically to blame.</b></i>  <i><b>Only in the aggregate there are excellent conditions for criminals.</b></i> <br><br>  Yes, and of course, ordinary Internet users were not cheated either: <br><br>  - they have the right to spend money on the most "safe" software and the coolest antiviruses;  the coolest admins and the most sophisticated defense against DDoS attacks; <br>  - have the right to spend as much time as they like trying to understand the intricacies and constant updates in the ‚Äúsecurity sphere‚Äù.  Well, the second or third higher will not hurt anyone, let them study.  And who could not - to blame; <br>  - have the right to spend money on advertising, have the right to write letters and go with statements to the Ministry of Internal Affairs. <br><br>  Actually, all rights are concentrated at users.  Neither domain registrars, hosters, nor search giants have any rights. <br><br>  It happened historically.  And no one wants to restrict the freedom of the Internet, especially the giants, the pillars of the Internet.  They are modest, civilized, democratic, and they should not be touched even by a shadow of suspicion of involvement in the organization of freedom. <br><br>  <b>So play on, show must go on.</b> </habracut></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/158463/">https://habr.com/ru/post/158463/</a></p>
