In this review, I filled this gap and talked about UMZCH of this period, which largely determined both marketing and philosophical approaches, as well as some areas of development (and regression) of the circuit design of modern amplifiers. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/ae1/e61/289/ae1e61289686436cb6b3b76c2021a19d.jpg"><br><br>  As in previous posts, to create materials I relied on the opinions of experts Pult.ru, the publication of such resources as network54.com, soundandvision.com and many others.  Pricing information is derived from materials and announcements on 2ndhandhifi.co.uk and similar publications.  The publications in the audiophile press of the period under review were also analyzed, in particular, some issues of the magazines ‚ÄúSoundStage!‚Äù, ‚ÄúStereophile‚Äù, ‚ÄúThe Absolute Sound Magazine‚Äù, ‚ÄúPositive Feedback‚Äù.

      In addition to the above, the choice of devices for the title of cult took into account the opinions of such comrades as: Robert Green (Robert E. Greene) (not a writer - ed.), Harry Pierson, Jonathan Valin (Jonathan Valin) , as well as chronological and price data published by manufacturers. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h3>  The Sabbat of subjectivism, 18 watts, KNI 3%, Soviet lamps and tens of kilobaksov </h3><br>  It will be about one of the most controversial amplifiers of the end of the last century, which was developed by our compatriot, engineer Vladimir Lamm.  Being an experienced engineer, Vladimir immigrated to the USA in 1987, where he started producing expensive Hi-End tube amplifiers.  It should be noted that Lamm chose a blessed time for immigration, interest in lamp technology in the west experienced another rise. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/bd4/ebc/728/bd4ebc728ea34b468c32f5cad5856a0b.jpg"></div><br>  It was in the late 80s that audiophile dreams of uncompromising sound were revived, like a phoenix from the ashes, and the ex-Soviet engineer (a fierce advocate of the lack of environmental protection) found opportunities to implement ambitious plans.  By the 90th, when the subject of these lines was created, the tube trend re-captured the heads of audiophiles, especially in the countries of the former Soviet Union, where lamps had been an attribute of reliable military equipment for many years. <br><br>  Soviet engineer Shushurin (he is in Lamm immigration), in 1997, he completed work on the creation of a tube mono amplifier Lamm ml 2, based on the Soviet triodes 633 (horned beasts).  Interestingly, as a true traditionalist, Lamm preferred the horn lamps, produced before 1985, noting that their quality had been much higher before that time. <br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/98b/f17/3a9/98bf173a9e1643eaae1e6da285b74738.jpg"></div><br>  Not without the help of publications in a number of ‚Äúomnipotent audiophile media‚Äù, this component is recognized as one of the best low-power amplifiers without environmental protection.  Experts praise the engineer and his unique product.  But the trouble is, the harmonic coefficient in this miracle of lamp circuitry does not even meet HI-FI standards and is 3%, and the level of intermodulation distortion reaches 8%. <br><br>  It is interesting that at the same time the <s>comrade</s> Mr. Lamm himself is sincerely convinced that: <br><blockquote>  ‚ÄúYou only need to listen to music.  The equipment should not worry you, it should disappear.  But only the highest-quality equipment has the ability to fade. ‚Äù </blockquote><br><br>  Proceeding from the developer's passage, the question arises: how, essentially distorting the recorded sound, the equipment can simply "disappear"?  In my opinion, the answer is simple, you need to convince the listener that she can (should) do it.  In almost every interview Lamm refers to the subjectivity in the perception of sound (and, in my opinion, he is largely right), but at the same time, to enhance the effects of subjective perception, he often mentions the number of audiophile publications that have approved his next development. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/1a3/89e/7fb/1a389e7fb6a542e696d8ed7a6b4a41e7.jpg"><br><br>  I happened to hear the magic amplifier already in the Lamm ml 2.1 version, the experts of the Consumer Electronics Show recognized this version as the best low-power amplifier.  I did not experience the delight of the ‚Äúdivine sound‚Äù of this tube toy, but I want to note that, reading about the first ml2, I expected the worst. <br><br>  Our experts also note that this legendary cult sample has the following significant disadvantages: <br><br><ul><li>  extremely low temperature stability of parameters </li><li>  input cascade with common cathode is too high </li><li>  unacceptable even for the hi-fi class nonlinearity component in all modes of allowable stress </li><li>  high grid current does not allow the use of A2 mode </li><li>  low reliability of the used type of lamp terminator at close to the maximum allowable values ‚Äã‚Äãof voltages and powers. </li></ul><br>  In addition, the Lamma amplifier has a really warm sound, in the literal sense of the word - the heat generated during its operation is so great that the device can be switched on in the winter as a heater.  And all these pleasures of the warmest tube delight just for ... drumming ... <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/3b4/850/cb6/3b4850cb62cb459eadfffc86672782a9.jpg"><br><br>  35 990 dollars (the price is indicated for a couple of pieces, the calculated gain of each of the stereo channels). <br>  Specifications of the improved model Lamm ML2.2 <br><br><blockquote>  Rated output  power: 18 W / 16 Ohm (18 W / 8 Ohm, 18 W / 4 Ohm) <br>  Maximum power: 21 W / 16 Ohm (20 W / 8 Ohm, 20 W / 4 Ohm) <br>  Rated output  voltage: <br>  24 V / 16 Ohm @ 36 W (peak) <br>  17 V / 8 Ohm @ 36 W (peak) <br>  12 V / 4 Ohm @ 36 W (peak) <br>  Frequency range: 20 Hz - 20 kHz (-0.3 dB @ 18 W / 16 Ohm) <br>  (+0, -3 dB) 3 Hz - 80 kHz (-3 dB @ 1 W / 16 Ohm) <br>  Slew rate o.  signal: (10 kHz, square wave with a span of 48 V, 16 Ohms) 15 V / Œºs <br>  Intermodulation distortion: no more than 8% <br>  Inputs: 1 pseudobalanced non-inverse XLR / 1 unbalanced non-inverse RCA <br>  Login  sensitivity: 0.85 V RMS @ 18 W / 16, 8, 4 Ohm <br>  Input impedance: 41 kŒ© (470 pF) <br>  Output impedance: 1.68 ohm @ 1 kHz (oh. 16 ohm) / 0.84 ohm @ 1 kHz (oh 8 ohm) / 0.42 ohm @ 1 kHz (oh 4 ohm) <br>  Damping factor: 9.5 @ 1 kHz / 16, 8, 4 ohms <br>  9.5 ¬± 0.7 @ 30 Hz - 20 kHz / 16, 8, 4 Ohm <br>  Weight, kg: 36.8 </blockquote><br><h3>  Johnson's multi-bulb monsters </h3><br>  When you first look at the amplifier, which I describe below, I thought that the developers are increasing the number of lamps not for the sake of circuit design, but for the brutality of design.  I was mistaken, not for the sake of design, because the RMS, the amplifier we are considering, is not at all, but 600 W (PMPO is more than 2200 W).  I'm afraid to guess why Johnson created the Hi-End amplifier with a power of more than half a kilowatt, but he managed to impress the experts of world audio magazines. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/bc6/d50/626/bc6d5062694241d4ae8388a6f2fd3598.jpg"></div><br>  In particular, Robert Green from the pompous audiophile edition of The Absolute Sound Magazine noted that: <br><br><blockquote>  ‚ÄúAudio Research Reference 610T immediately set a new standard in high-quality music playback.‚Äù </blockquote><br>  So, in 1995, the disinterested enthusiast of uncompromising sound from Audio Research, William Zane Johnson, created, as Hi-end apologists, one of Audio Research reference 610T, one of the best high-power audio amplifiers.  As befits the TruHiendu, the UMZCH was monophonic, so a pair of devices provided independent amplification for each channel (with a total RMS of 1200 W).  The huge power of 600 W for this class of devices (with an output resistance of 4 Ohm, 8 Ohm or 16 Ohm) is provided by the output stages created on the basis of 16 6550C lamps.  The amplifier is built on a push-pull, fully symmetrical scheme. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/050/88c/714/05088c7145ac41b38c33ffbce45de69c.jpg"><br><br>  Lamps of a wasteful giant are designed for 2,000 hours of work, but, according to some authors, with a long load close to the limit, they rarely fail, much earlier. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/e1a/c40/848/e1ac408482a942aaa9ef9b90ea19af2c.jpg"></div><br>  So, briefly about the characteristics: <br><br><blockquote>  RMS: 600 W / channel <br>  Frequency range: (-3dB points) 15 Hz to 150 kHz. <br>  Input sensitivity: 4.2V (24dB gain at 8 ohms) <br>  Input resistance: 200 KŒ© <br>  Output impedance 4, 8, 16 ohms. <br>  Total negative feedback: 13dB <br>  Cushioning: approximately 16 <br>  THD: below 0.1% <br>  IMD: below 0.5% <br>  Lamps: (8 pairs) 6550C matched power output;  (1) 6550C regulator;  (1) preamplifier 6H30 regulator;  (2) 6550C driver;  (2) 6NIP input, (1) 6H30 in series. <br>  Weight: 225 kg per pair. <br>  Price per pair: $ 40,000 </blockquote><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/226/0df/308/2260df3086d940d2918de896b7ba398d.jpg"><br><br>  The construction of the three-unit chassis of the hulk, called the Tower (Tower), was equipped with a converter cooling system, i.e.  completely devoid of coolers, and accordingly, the heat transfer from 16 lamps of the end can completely compete with household heating appliances.  Input and output lamps are placed on the top of the tower, which according to the creator should be covered with a vented casing.  However, the majority of labor lovers TLZ remove the casing in order to <s>stick</s> in the dark <s>to</s> delight the gaze of the light burning radio tubes. <br><br>  Everything related to this amplifier, and other miracles from comrade Johnson, I associate with the concept car for automotive exhibitions.  They are also created to demonstrate the possibilities, but not to ride them. <br><br><h3>  Integral Killer TLZ - NAD-3020 </h3><br>  The NAD-3020 is the only component in this review that received the title of cult without the help of high-profile publications in the audio press and speculation about the aspirations of retrograde owners of gold ears.  This UMZCH can not be called a masterpiece of three-dimensional design, it is simple and practical, and most importantly it sounds great. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/8bc/de1/fe1/8bcde1fe1986474dab58b019d8aa5700.jpg"><br><br>  The integrated amplifier NAD 3020 appeared in 1979, and was designed under the guidance of one of the best amplification engineering engineers in Europe, Bjorn Erik Edwardsen (Bjorn Erik Edvardsen).  A talented innovator was able to create a unique UMZCH for its time, which surpassed almost all competing counterparts, and in some cases, competed with devices that were 5-6 times more expensive. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/71d/c68/43a/71dc6843a1274165a818fff6232c1e6f.jpg"></div><br>  For more than 10 years, the NAD 3020 has remained the benchmark of an integrated HI-FI amplifier, has been updated and modernized many times, until the early 90s.  This UMZCH practically destroyed the myth that expensive and short-lived lamps are the only alternative.  The emergence of this product led to the fact that NAD was among the most successful global manufacturers of UMZCH in the 80s.  There was no better selling Hi-FI class UMZCH in the world; the NAD 3220 sold more than 500,000 components. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/fac/47c/2ac/fac47c2ac6924699b3b8f941e5a6b514.jpg"><br><br>  The reason for the popularity of this amplifier was the low cost, and accordingly, the optimal price / quality ratio, high efficiency and economy, high build quality, unattainable for other products in its price category characteristics: <br><br><blockquote>  Rated power: 28 watts per channel with 8 ohm load <br>  S / N ratio:&gt; 75 dB (1 W) <br>  Channel separation:&gt; 60 dB <br>  Frequency range: 20 Hz ~ 20 kHz at ¬± 5 dB <br>  Infrasound filter: 24 dB / octave at -3 dB, at 15 Hz <br>  Ultrasonic filter: 12 dB / oct at -3 dB, at 35 kHz <br>  Nominal distortion: 0.02% (from 20 Hz to 20 kHz) <br>  Input impedance: 47 kŒ© <br>  Input sensitivity: 2.5 mV, 20 W at 1 kHz <br>  IHF dynamic range: +3 dB at 8 ohms <br>  IHF dynamic power: 40 W per channel at 8 ohm load <br>  Electricity consumption: up to 70 W (maximum) <br>  Weight: 5.3 kg </blockquote><br>  And ... price ... drum roll: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/574/405/135/5744051351424f89843194a835c15b42.gif"><br><br>  ¬£ 79 (US $ 133) No, I did not forget to add a zero, just so much!  In view of inflation, today the price of this amplifier would be $ 410. <br><br>  I deliberately completed this publication exactly NAD 3220, so that the 80s and 90s did not remain for the readers an exceptionally bleak time and permeated with red threads of warm lamp marketing.  Signed development left quite a few, if readers are not tired, we will continue the series, ready to announce at least one more material. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/401889/">https://habr.com/ru/post/401889/</a></p>
