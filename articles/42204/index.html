  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Videoconference for 120 people - a real reality!</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  A little earlier, I wrote here about the fact that they say so and so, there is such a project VZOchat.  So this project is the ONLY Internet video conferencing service for 120 people.  Do not confuse - do not broadcast ala SmotKom.  Namely videoconferencing.  Where you can chat in real time!  ‚ÄúWhat the fuck is that ?!‚Äù the ardent lovers of David Blaine will shout, ‚ÄúBut such a crowd is unreal! ..‚Äù And they will be wrong.  To communicate in such a large group just need to learn how to follow the rules.  And these rules are implemented in a special VZOchat video conferencing mode called ‚Äú2x120‚Äù.  What does it mean?  SchA everything will be! <br><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  To begin with the theory.  The 2 to 120 mode resembles a lecture hall with a podium.  120 people in the hall and two seats on the podium.  Everyone sees these two places at the same time.  Everyone can send notes to everyone, and to someone specifically (chat). <br><br>  The one who initiates a group conference is called a host.  The conference is tied to him, to connect to the conference if you are not called, just call the host.  He can set the auto-accept mode for new members or manually confirm each request. 
      <br>

      The host calls the empty tribune, he also has the right to throw someone out of the conference (Kick).  The host always occupies one of the two stands. <br><br>  Mode "2 120" is available starting with version 6.2, which you can download now.  This version (or older) is required for both the organizer and the participant. <br><br>  <b>Now, the details and pictures</b> <i>(by the way, if you still NEVER, then you should download and install the application, otherwise it will not be clear ... I remind you - <a href="http://www.vzochat.com/">www.vzochat.com</a> );)</i> <br><br>  To start a video conference click on the button. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/161/5e0/427/1615e0427a5ec944d67cc66c8abab93c.png" alt="image"><br><br><br>  The Video Conferencing Wizard opens. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/208/6e0/0a3/2086e00a3a1b624828a8f6b39002efaf.png" alt="image"><br><br>  What does that mean: <br><br>  1. Topic (Topic) Theme of the conference.  Just a few words.  Can not fill <br>  2. Type Type of conference.  There are symmetric "6 by 6" and broadcasting "2 by 120" <br>  3. Scope (Scope) Will your conference be displayed in the list of conferences on the web server vzochat.com This function is under development and will be available for several weeks. <br>  4. Auto accept participation requests - when checked, all callers will automatically join the conference. <br><br>  User selection window.  Left are online users from your address book.  On the right is the conference participants window.  Users can be transferred from the left to the right window with the help of arrows. <br><br>  To create a 2 to 120 conference, check <br><br>  * Topic (optional) <br>  * Type - broadcasting "2 to 120" <br>  * Scope - Public <br>  * Allow participants to log in automatically - yes <br>  * Dial initial users (at least one).  The rest can join the conference call, they just need to call you. <br><br>  Click Start. <br><br>  Congratulations, the conference has begun.  You are now the host of the conference, the other participants are told about this by an asterisk in front of your name in the list of participants of the conference. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/565/d68/3a4/565d683a4be0c3bf9f1f2a01481e2dc6.png" alt="image"><br><br>  You can now invite someone to the podium.  Simply select the item ‚ÄúInvite to the podium‚Äù in the drop-down menu when you hover the mouse on the participant. <br><br>  If someone behaves indecently on the podium, he can be removed from the conference by the Kick team from the same menu. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/ed1/e12/eaf/ed1e12eaf7868590b53ce295a0a84393.png" alt="image"><br><br>  To end the conference, click on "hang up."  The conference will end, everyone will be disconnected. <br><br>  Now we will look at the 2 on 120 conference with the eyes of a participant.  You either accept the call from the Host or yourself, knowing that the Host is hosting the conference (an asterisk appears next to his name in the contact list), you can call him as usual.  If he confirms your participation or the auto join mode is set to his conference, then you will easily join. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/325/b78/162/325b78162f4659ec3c8f880c680673d0.png" alt="image"><br><br>  When you look at a performance, you can: <br><br>  * Change the volume of its broadcast for yourself relative to other participants, turn off its sound altogether. <br>  * Temporarily disable his video broadcast <br>  * Send him a message in general and private chat <br>  * ‚ÄúDisconnect‚Äù its picture from the VZOchat program window and, for example, enlarge it. <br><br>  For all these operations, hover the mouse over the video speaker and use the menu that appears. <br><br><img src="http://vzochat.com/en/images/conference/2120_5.png" alt="image"><br><br>  You can also speak.  To do this, hover the mouse over your image from the camera, in the drop-down menu you will see the buttons ‚ÄúTake a Tribune‚Äù, ‚ÄúRelease the Tribune‚Äù (one of them is always inactive) and ‚ÄúExpress a replica‚Äù. <br><br>  Click ‚ÄúTake a Tribune‚Äù and your request will be sent to Host, if it approves it, your image and sound will be broadcast to all conference participants.  At the end of the speech, click on the ‚ÄúRelease Tribune‚Äù button and your broadcast will stop, you will become just a listener. <br><br>  It is possible in the course of the performance of another participant to make a reply (thought out loud, all participants will hear it).  To do this, press and hold the button "Reply cue".  All that you say at this moment, all participants will hear.  Release the mouse button after the end of the replica.  Only one participant can speak at any time.  The rest at this moment the button "Replica" is not available. <br><br>  Opposite the participant pronouncing the cue in the list, the special symbol lights up. <br>  (unfortunately, it is still impossible to make a regime when the leader decides whether it is possible to give a reply now or not, which does not exclude the possibility of hooliganism ... soon will be;)) <br><br>  To exit the conference call, end the call (red). <br><br>  I think that such a regime can be useful in many places - seminars, presentations, press conferences, etc.  What do you think, habrovchane? <br><br></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/42204/">https://habr.com/ru/post/42204/</a></p>
