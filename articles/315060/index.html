In the sense that I want to get to the root causes, to the fundamental principles of the human psyche.  To the point that in principle leads (or does not) move us.  Before our desires, motives, needs. <br><br>  But, since in the previous article I indicated that there are many desires and all of them must be taken into account, let's try to think what desires we do not take into account.  And, guided by the principle of ‚ÄúBack to basics!‚Äù, Let's define what desires are at the basis of everything.

    <a name="habracut"></a>  To do this, let's consider the imposed in the teeth, but still largely true "Maslow pyramid."  Do not worry, we will also consider it not as you are already tired! <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/05d/d89/11c/05dd8911c2915c02bf6fd9a04197e675.png" alt="image"><br><br>  So, here is the pyramid.  The pyramid, as you know, has a peak and ... a base.  Base?  Yes exactly!  We say - "Back to basics!".  Or, to put it another way, to the basics. <br><br>  What do we have at the bottom?  At the base we have physiological needs.  Or, let's say a little differently - the desire of the body. <br><br>  Desire of the body, I note - this is not only to eat, drink, sleep.  This is how it functions and how our entire body moves.  What moves he makes.  What poses to take.  How does each of the internal organs. <br><br>  And this level, the fundamental level, the level at which everything else is held - in modern man, as a rule, is ignored most of all.  But as for us, for programmers, it is generally beyond.  Almost all of our body work does not require participation at all.  No wonder we forget about him. <br><br>  So, most likely, it is the dissatisfaction of the needs of the body that blocks the satisfaction of the needs of higher levels. <br><br>  Well, well, okay, you have to do something with the body.  So what to do?  After all, of course, we don‚Äôt want to do exercises ... Stop, why don‚Äôt we?  This is the realization of the needs of the body, because we must want it, according to everything written above! <br><br>  And here we go back to the previous article.  The essence of which boiled down to the fact that it is useless to stupidly cast ‚Äúmotivating‚Äù techniques on yourself - you must first figure out what we really want. <br><br>  And with the body - the same thing.  We must not stupidly cast exercises from school physical education on ourselves, but figure out what our body needs specifically now.  Explore the real desires of your own body. <br><br>  And here we will help the usual attentiveness.  Start listening to your body.  Pay attention to what it feels pleasure from, and from what - suffering.  What movements he likes.  What poses.  What kind of food.  And so on and so forth.  Learn all the details. <br><br>  And here, I believe, suddenly it turns out that with a competent restructuring of work with your body, you will feel other desires in yourself.  Higher level.  Because this higher level has finally got a foundation. <br><br>  And I believe that it works for all the other levels of Maslow's pyramid.  If you experience a ‚Äúplug‚Äù at a higher level - pay attention to the lower ones.  Most likely, the reason for plugging is inside them. <br><br>  Please leave comments on the results of the use of this advice in the comments, unless, of course, you want to follow it.  However, if you do not want to - write too.  We want to understand what we really want, and not stupidly to cast my articles on myself, right?  :) </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/315060/">https://habr.com/ru/post/315060/</a></p>
