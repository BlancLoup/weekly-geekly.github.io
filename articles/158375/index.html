  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Roskomnadzor registry. More questions than answers</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  I decided to bring together all the facts, conjectures and questions regarding the registry of banned sites that had begun to operate, and now I‚Äôve got such a list. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  1. <b>Who is the creator of the site <a href="http://www.zapret-info.gov.ru/">www.zapret-info.gov.ru</a> ?</b>  Although this is not fundamental for the very facts of blocking, everyone in general is not aware of the love of our state bodies for creating in-house information systems.  Practically everything is given to third-party companies and conducted through public procurement with millions of price tags. <br>  In this case, it turns out that the site was created, bypassing the procedure of public procurement.  In addition, there is such <a href="http://izvestia.ru/news/538678">strange news</a> about the transfer of some software for maintaining the registry and contacting providers from the Safe Internet League to Roskomnadzor, which raises even more questions.  What is this software, on what basis was it transmitted and accepted, and why free of charge. <br><br>  2. <b>How do providers block and how is the law permitted?</b>  By law, providers have the right to block sites or pages either by URL, by domain or IP, and the type of blocking is left to the discretion of the provider, depending on the availability of technical capabilities.  This was also confirmed in <a href="http://www.rsoc.ru/press/conference/conf8.htm">the Roskomnadzor online conference</a> .  Accordingly, although many small and medium-sized providers express readiness to block access by URL, nevertheless some trunk providers have already begun blocking in the most direct and least expensive way for them.  They just send the IP addresses that hit the registry to null-route, as a result, when trying to access forbidden sites, no warnings or blocking pages are seen, but the request just falls off by timeout.  According to reports, one of the few operators who did more or less correctly is MTS.  They use a bunch of their DPI (Cisco SCE) with a filter from Netpolice.  As a result, sites remain accessible, and only banned URLs are blocked. <br><br>  3. <b>Do all providers turn on filtering?</b>  In the future, this should be done by everyone and regional Roskomnadzors are already beginning to put pressure on providers to connect to the registry.  In addition, even if your provider does not put any filters yet, this does not mean that you will get access to the sites from the registry.  The backbone providers, as already written above, begin to block sites and to small providers the traffic will most likely come already after filtering at the backbone provider.

      4. <b>Will other sites be blocked other than the registry?</b>  By law, all sites for which court decisions to ban information have been included should be included in the register.  In the online conference, Roskomnadzor used a somewhat strange formulation that ‚ÄúCourt decisions on the recognition of prohibited information taken before November 1, 2012 will be taken into account.‚Äù What does this threaten?  The fact that in the end get into the registry and livejournal.com and youtube.com and a bunch of other sites.  Deputies Edra say about 12,000 sites.  The search for Federal Law Services gives about 6000 court decisions, so in principle this number of sites is fair.  And youtube.com will have to get into the registry not even in connection with the ‚ÄúInnocence of Muslims‚Äù, but on the basis of earlier decisions.  By the way, prohibited content specified in these solutions is still available on youtube. <br><br>  5. <b>About the strangeness of locks.</b>  The registry was allegedly created primarily to combat child porn.  However, the texts of the law use slightly different wording, what is pornography and especially childish.  As a result, those two items in the registry, where they allegedly have child porn, are actually illegally blocked, based on the mere allegation that the pictures are child porn.  The first photo of kissing gay men is not in doubt about pornography, but it raises doubts about the age of the models.  Allegedly there are fully adults.  The second photo with dvachcha with naked girls does not cause doubts that the models are minors, but it does not at all fall under the definition of pornography.  That is, in fact, the decisions of Roskomnadzor experts about blocking this content are arbitrary and not based on the norms of the laws.  Also, the decision that the image is pornography and especially a child should be made on the basis of art criticism expertise, which was definitely not done. <br><br>  6. <b>Big problems with the search form on the registry website.</b>  Without actually knowing the exact registry entry, it is impossible to understand whether your site or its page is in the registry.  Adding / deleting www, other get-parameters in the URL and the registry already says that there is no such entry.  Whether this will be fixed is not known.  The best option would be for the entered name of the site to issue, whether he himself or any of his pages in the registry.  Although it may in Roskomnadzor win their paranoia and will result in the issuance of results in a form suitable for use. <br><br>  And what is the result?  As a result, it turns out that Roskomnadzor, along with other government agencies, where requests for expertise are being transferred, are busy in fact for concealing crimes.  Instead of fighting with manufacturers and distributors of prohibited content, they actually condone the concealment of relevant crimes.  For example, Article 242 Part 1 of the Criminal Code of the Russian Federation on child pornography indicates the proliferation of such pornography via the Internet as an aggravating circumstance.  However, were any requests for initiation of relevant criminal cases based on references to the register transferred to the Ministry of Internal Affairs?  I strongly doubt it.  The same applies to sites with drugs. <br><br>  In light of this, it seems necessary to send a complaint to the General Prosecutor‚Äôs Office about the actions of Roskomnadzor and the Federal Drug Control Service, so that the prosecutor‚Äôs office would check their actions against articles of Criminal Code 285 Abuse of official duties and 293 Negligence.  The Internet will become cleaner only if Roskomnadzor and the Federal Drug Control Service not only block websites for us, but actually fight against prohibited content on the Internet, especially since they have all the possibilities for this. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/158375/">https://habr.com/ru/post/158375/</a></p>
