      <b>Why such a study seems to me interesting</b> <br><br>  I have been working in the gaming industry since 2003.  Recently celebrated 10 years.  He started from a small startup, worked in mobile phones, went through Allods, and now I'm working on the company's flagship project.  During this time, the industry has changed a lot, but unfortunately, many people still think that games are a lot of freaks and asocial personalities.  And both from the point of view of company employees and the audience.  Such a presentation, frankly, annoying, and I want to fight with him. <br><br>  In terms of employees, it's a little easier for us to dispel myths, because  we ourselves are not freaks.  We teach at the Technopark in Baumanka, speak at conferences and in a different way show that very creative and at the same time skilled employees work in games. <br>  But in terms of players is much more complicated.  Of course, it is possible to talk about the generation that has already grown up, which has been playing since childhood.  But although it seems obvious (consoles appeared in the 90s), nevertheless, many do not believe in the image of a normal person with family and healthy values, who also love to play. <br><br>  So, now, thanks to the research that the gaming department has prepared, finally, there are numbers with which to operate to show the maturity of the gaming industry in the Russian Federation. <br><br>  From the research it is clear that the Russian gaming industry is actively developing, more and more resembling the largest, long-established western markets and competing with other forms of entertainment.  So at the end of 2012, the gaming industry overtook film distribution in terms of development speed and market volume. <br><br>  It is worth making a reservation here that a similar post could have been written a year ago, but then the results were only for internal use.  This time the company decided to share it with everyone and expanded it, adding to the data on the market volume and comparative analytics, a study of the image of the modern Russian gamer, which is most interesting to me personally. <br><br>  <b>About big money</b> <br><br>  The turnover of the Russian gaming market in 2012 continued to grow and reached $ 1.3 billion, showing a 1.5-fold increase in two years.  For me personally, this figure is interesting because we made a film distribution.  I think this is very revealing, because  Cinema is one of the recognized community of entertainment.  And we made them!  Well, and secondly, this figure sobers up some fellow students who twisted a finger at their heads when 10 years ago, I said that I wanted to make games.  They said that I did not earn a normal life.  And I said that if you combine inspiration, hard work and education, then success will come.  So it turned out.  The film industry is over, the concert industry is ahead, but there, however, there is still digging and digging. <br><br>  But, generally speaking, the first 11 pages of the report are more likely for people from the industry, big bosses and investors.  There's a lot about money, income, trends, and so on and so forth.  This is not the topic of this post, so I‚Äôll just show you beautiful pictures with infographics, of which so much is clear. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/b47/f15/a9a/b47f15a9a53aa1d130bb241a898170cd.jpg"><br><br>  But the dynamics of the structure <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/eed/981/5ae/eed9815ae4cded5a6af1dded10ae9989.jpg"><br><br>  <b>And now about gamers</b> <br><br>  First, a small quote: ‚Äúthe study included qualitative and quantitative steps.  The qualitative stage took place in Moscow in November 2012. 15 in-depth ethnographic interviews with players and 8 focus groups with people who did not play computer games were conducted.  Based on the results of the qualitative phase, a methodology was developed for a quantitative online survey.  The survey was conducted in cities of Russia with a population of 100 thousand people and more in December 2012 (the sample was 2033 respondents, over 13 years old). ‚Äù <br><br>  I specifically bring it here, so that fans of jokes about ‚ÄúInternet site research showed that 100% of Russian citizens use the Internet‚Äù, have calmed down a bit.  This research is really serious, because  Here, the very game direction is extremely interested in the high quality of the sample - we need to understand our audience well. <br><br>  So, the study showed that today 87% of the Internet audience in Russia plays games more than once a month.  The average age of a gamer was 33 years old (in this we ‚Äúcaught up‚Äù with the European countries), mainly specialists with higher education and students (44% of all players).  Those.  it is either already educated people, or those who strive for it.  Moreover, if you think a little, it becomes clear that games in moderation do not make it impossible to finish the university.  After all, they have been playing in Russia for about 20 years, and during this time many issues have just accumulated, in which players quietly passed the exams.  Of course, many of us remember classmates who flew out of the university because of the games, but the numbers show well that such cases are an exception.  Most know how to combine hobby games and study, and then a career.  About a career, I returned to finance, there is a point in the study about expenses, from which it is clear that the players are not rogue. <br><br>  Another fact that the study showed well is that there is no gender advantage.  There are genre dependencies, but in general there is a gender balance.  According to the data received, 54% of the players are women.  At the same time, socio-demographic portraits of players show that men and women choose different games: for example, women play more often in social networks (61% of women and only 39% of men), while men prefer client games (65%). <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/25f/035/214/25f03521414a5ce74763ffcace7304a1.jpg"><br><br>  Now look at the game experience.  It should be understood that the strong bias online in paragraph 1-5 years, rather due to the growing popularity of the genre.  In fact, the offline figures show that each generation gave its gamers.  Just in the last 5 years, with the growth of Internet speeds and the release of IMOs, which were designed for a wide audience, online has dramatically raised its momentum.  Therefore, personally in my opinion, the numbers just show that games gradually occupy their niche in the culture of leisure, and there are more and more people for whom this is absolutely normal.  Therefore, I repeat, not freaks play, but ordinary people around us.  Just the culture of society does not change in one day, it always happens gradually. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/678/d34/d50/678d34d508d9c062868370b64f05ac66.jpg"><br><br>  Also in the study there is a very beautiful picture that refutes the myth that the games devour the time of those who play them.  The numbers perfectly show that the number of fanatical players on average corresponds to any hobby or entertainment.  It should be understood that they are usually the most visible, and their stories are the most colorful, but this is a consequence of their fanaticism, and not the subject of fanaticism. <br><br>  But ordinary players, most of whom, who spend 0-30% of their leisure time on games, calmly finish university, get acquainted with the opposite sex, create families, have children, do not create shocking news around themselves.  They are normal, and they do not make hot news.  Perhaps that is why public stereotypes are so skewed.  But just look at the numbers, add up the three lower categories, and you will see a portrait of the majority.  It spends on games less than a third of the time.  This is quite a normal percentage for any entertainment. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/713/dde/04c/713dde04c9a887cfd9841fa2835a204a.jpg"><br><br>  In conclusion, I want to say that I really hope that this really high-quality and detailed research will allow people to open their eyes to reality.  Perhaps this reality is unpleasant for generations who used to go to the cinema and watch TV, but even their grandparents saw something new, unusual and, possibly, dangerous in mass cinema and TV.  But I repeat, in my opinion, this is absolutely normal.  Society always changes gradually, simply by virtue of human properties.  And now games are becoming the norm.  It will take 100 years and something else will be the norm, and former players will lament, about the <s>times of Ochakovsky and the conquest of the Crimea</s> that now in our times went to raids, gatherings of clans, and now the youth ... but it always has been and will be. <br><br>  This is actually all I wanted to say.  If someone is interested in the details, then here‚Äôs the <a href="http://corp.mail.ru/press/research/">link</a> again.  If you still want to see in such studies, write.  After all, they are games for the players, for the audience.  We, of course, will be happy to pay attention to other aspects, downloading analysts with new work))). </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/183248/">https://habr.com/ru/post/183248/</a></p>
