      Once again, with a friend, we waved to our relatives, to the beautiful city of Bratsk.  My uncle is a real Siberian and a connoisseur of those taiga edges.  To coordinate their actions, we decided to buy a radio.  I opted for an inexpensive Chinese device.  Experts say that the price is normal, and the quality of communication is bearable.  Well, I ordered it at ‚ÄúAli‚Äù. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  <i>Screen with aliexpress</i> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/6c6/5e3/e46/6c65e3e461d54b5cada0d28aa06bd62b.png"><br><br>  She came to me, tuned it through the computer somehow and took it with him.  Claims to her work was not particularly, except that the battery is weak. <br><br>  I returned home.  Then they somehow went fishing on the canal to them.  Moscow, well, included.  It turned out that you can listen to the talks of the Ministry of Internal Affairs (148-149 MHz) on it. <br><br>  In a week I am going to work - the doorbell rings: ‚ÄúOpen, radio frequency service!‚Äù.  It turned out that serious people from Roskomnadzor came, they say, a complaint about you came from the police, you get on someone else's air. <br><br>  In general, they caught us in radio hooliganism, they imposed a fine of 300 rubles.  based on this <a href="http://ds.mos.ru/contractors-and-suppliers-/memo-to-construction-companies-on-the-legality-of-the-use-of-radio-electronic-means/%25D0%259F%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BC%25D1%258F%25D1%2582%25D0%25BA%25D0%25B0.pdf">article</a> .  The radio was not taken away, because  we were not malicious radio hooligans-recidivists. <br><br>  From a conversation with an employee, I found out that in order to use Baofeng, you must register the radio in Roskomnadzor, but first pass the exams for the radio amateur category.  Then I can use the radio legally on a larger frequency range than those who do not have this category. <br><br>  So <a href="http://news.srr.ru/%3Fpage_id%3D869">began</a> my journey on the air.  It was not easy, but fascinating. <br><br>  <b>Amateur Radio Exam</b> <br><br>  First of all, it was necessary to prepare for the exam.  On the website of the Union of Radio Amateurs of Russia (SRR), I found <a href="">questions for the exam</a> and the <a href="http://news.srr.ru/%3Fpage_id%3D5110">program</a> for self-testing.  For dummies there is also a <a href="http://www.cqham.ru/xe1.htm">manual</a> .  It became clear that it is better to take the exam at the RFTC of the Central Federal District, because  CPP requires the exam to enter into and pay a fee. <br><br>  It turned out that there are as many as four ranks of radio amateurs, just like in sports. <br><br>  <u>The fourth category</u> is for beginners.  Radio amateurs of this category are allowed to work on all VHF bands with a maximum power of 5 watts.  Requires minimal knowledge of the rules for the use of radio stations, the rules of radio communications. <br><br>  <u>The third category</u> is also for beginners, but the possibilities are much greater.  It is allowed to use not only all the VHF - ranges, but also specially designated areas on all HF (except 30, 20, 17, 12 meters).  The device can have a power of 10 watts. <br><br>  <u>The second category</u> is the most widespread; it is much more difficult to pass the exam than on the 3rd and 4th.  To the knowledge of technology are much higher requirements.  Received a certificate for 2 cat.  can use VHF and HF bands with a capacity of 100 VA. <br><br>  <u>The first category</u> is the most serious of all.  Surrenders will be asked to accept Morse code at a speed of 60 characters per minute.  But they also have more rights than others on VHF - the power range can be 500 W, and on the HF - the range is 1000 W. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/8fa/956/cbf/8fa956cbf83a4a82b1a3f8effba6b93b.png">  " <br><br>  I decided to take the third category, because  the requirement for it is not much tougher than the fourth.  I signed up for the exam in RFC CFD on the phone (495) 2588050. Before going to the exam, you must fill out an <a href="http://rfs-rf.ru/upload/medialibrary/141/27_proverka-sootvetstviya-ekspluatatsionnoy-i-tekhnicheskoy-gotovnosti-operatorov-lyubitelskoy-sluzhby.doc">application</a> , a sample of which is on the RFC website. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/ebf/e94/fe3/ebfe94fe33ec4d2690e6bc7453d5f53b.png"><br>  <i>Sample application</i> <br><br>  Then I sent the scanned application and a copy of the passport of the Russian Federation to info@rfc-cfa.ru, in the subject line of the letter, please indicate ‚ÄúRFTC CFA‚Äù.  I was called back and scheduled an exam. <br><br>  At the appointed time, I arrived with a printed application and <a href="http://rfs-rf.ru/upload/medialibrary/94a/019617.doc">payment order</a> at the address: ul.  Starokrymskaya, 13 Building 1 (this is Butovo), where he passed the exam. <br><br>  I came, they put me behind a computer, and I answered the test questions.  It reminded me of the theory in the traffic police, only simpler.  After an hour and a half, they gave me a certificate of the third category. <br><br>  <b>Receiving callsign</b> <br><br>  Having passed the educational program, I received the call sign on the HRCHC site in <a href="http://grfc.ru/grfc/new_kz/">the applicant's</a> office.  They said that this is better: and the request will not be lost, and in case of loss of the document you can always restore it, which you cannot do by e-mail. <br><br>  At the top, I found the tab "Generate a call sign." <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/311/f12/011/311f1201182d461a96e6954a4234cd3b.png"><br><br>  In the end, I attached to the request a certificate of assigning a radio amateur category along with <a href="http://www.grfc.ru/upload/medialibrary/d24/010891.doc">this</a> form.  I did not indicate the number and date of the cover letter. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/cdc/0e7/dc2/cdc0e7dc277548c08616c7cf92d96804.png"><br>  <i>The last step in the applicant's office</i> <br><br>  <u>Registration of RES</u> <br><br>  After a couple of days I received a certificate of call sign education through the office in an electronic form, it only remains for me to register the distribution zone via the website of <a href="https://www.gosuslugi.ru/">public services</a> .  Immediately make a reservation, without a <a href="https://www.gosuslugi.ru/pgu/htdocs/docs/DS_Manual_RTK.pdf">digital signature,</a> you can not submit an online application. <br><br>  To make life easier for beginners, telling how to do it.  You need to go through the following tabs on the site: <br><br>  <b>All services</b> ‚Üí <a href="https://www.gosuslugi.ru/structure">Government authorities</a> ‚Üí <a href="https://www.gosuslugi.ru/structure/10000002842">Roskomnadzor</a> ‚Üí <a href="https://www.gosuslugi.ru/163084">Registration of radio-electronic means and high-frequency devices for civilian use</a> ‚Üí <a href="https://www.gosuslugi.ru/pgu/service/10000039573_10000019026.html">Registration of a certificate of registration of radio-electronic means</a> ‚Üí <b>Tab to receive a service</b> . <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/c66/5c8/1dd/c665c81dd9574850a439ace7c3054612.png"><br>  <i>This is how the form of filling looks, which must be carefully filled.</i> <br><br>  It is necessary to carefully fill in all the fields with an asterisk in exact accordance with the passport of the radio (information about the call sign, the emission class at VHF frequencies F3E, transmitter power, information about the antenna and the category of radio amateur).  The applicant may even choose the method of receiving the application: in person or electronically through public services. <br><br>  After filling out the application, you will receive an electronic copy of the certificate of registration of RES in your personal account on state services. <br><br>  Most of all I had to travel in preparation for the exam, and the call sign and registration of the RECs is a remote process.  It certainly makes life easier.  It is also not very costly, because the only expenses were the payment of the fee for the exam at the RFRC CFD, everything else was done for free. <br><br>  Now I am the legal owner of a walkie-talkie with basic knowledge of radio business.  And I do not regret the time spent.  A walkie-talkie is like a car, a device that needs to be able to use, so as not to harm others.  Without proper training and without knowledge of radio laws, a radio can interfere with communications services. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/396983/">https://habr.com/ru/post/396983/</a></p>
