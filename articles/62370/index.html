  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Once again about life in the present</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  A couple of days ago, I stumbled upon the ‚ÄúSelf-Development‚Äù blog on a rather old <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/selfdevelopment/41197/">habratopeic of the</a> respected <a href="http://geektimes.ru/users/dilesoft/" class="user_link">DileSoft</a> ‚ÄúAlgorithm of Life in the Present‚Äù.  Speech in habratopik was about how to learn to "live in the present."  Being engaged in this issue for a long time and being somewhat in the subject, I would like to propose another algorithm for "life in the present." <br><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Immediately make a reservation that all of the below is based on the philosophy of Buddhism.  And on enough basic and common to many areas of things.  There are no religious aspects and no specialized chakra-type moments. <br><br>  "Life in the present" in the language of Pali is called "sati".  I will use the terms in this language (it was spoken at the time of the Buddha), because in translation the terms become inaccurate due to the mixed meanings.  Sati is a constant awareness of the current moment and yourself in it.  If you simplify, then it is to live without distraction.

      For example, if you write code and think about whether the previous 10 lines are well written - you are distracted.  You live not real, it is not ‚Äúsati‚Äù.  If you plan your business for the day in the morning - you are not distracted, this is ‚Äúsati‚Äù.  The principle is approximately the same. <br><br>  Of course, it‚Äôs important not only <b>what</b> you think, but also <b>why</b> you think.  If you remember where you could leave your phone yesterday, this is ‚Äúsati‚Äù.  If you remember how well you were with your ex, then it is not ‚Äúsati‚Äù. <br><br>  Two factors help not to be distracted and to perceive life ‚Äúhere and now‚Äù - the intensity of the moment and the sharpness of the mind (it is best to use the term ‚Äúpanna‚Äù from Pali). <br><br>  With the intensity of the moment everything is clear - you are rushing along the slope on a snowboard, you just have no time to be distracted.  That is why many are looking for thrills - they give a sense of life "here and now." <br><br>  But there is also a ‚Äúpanya‚Äù.  If you have a keen mind that can concentrate, then you can concentrate on any moment ‚Äî code, ice cream, your favorite, good book, etc. I wanted to write how to reach Pannja. <br><br>  This is the basic technique of meditation, which the Buddha taught, in the Pali language it is called ‚ÄúAnapanasati‚Äù (‚ÄúAnapana‚Äù + ‚ÄúSati‚Äù). <br><br>  This technique is, shall we say, an application / base purpose.  Unlike other techniques of meditation, it is allowed to pass on to friends, acquaintances, ets.  What I will try to do. <br><br>  The essence of the technique is in observing your breathing.  We must sit in a comfortable position.  Anywhere - on the floor, chair, couch.  The only condition - straight back and neck.  After that, you just watch your breath. <br><br>  Do not try to influence or control your breath in any way.  This is a very common mistake.  Breath control is included in many other meditation techniques, but here you are just a passive observer. <br><br>  Feel your breath.  Be aware of it.  Concentrate all your attention on the sensations on the upper lip, where it is touched by the air from the nostrils, and feel these sensations. <br><br>  Your mind will be constantly distracted by thoughts, emotions, sensations in the body.  No need to respond to them - neither positively nor negatively.  Just do not give them value and they will leave themselves.  If you can‚Äôt keep your attention on breathing - do not worry, wait a bit and go back to watching the breath. <br><br>  This technique trains the mind to be aware of the emotional and thought processes, sensations on the body and develops concentration.  I would advise you to give her 30 minutes in the morning and evening - it will pay for itself, believe me.  Despite the simplicity in theory, in practice it is quite complicated - the mind will resist attempts to control it, so be prepared for failure.  Take them calmly, and remember that at least one guy named Gautam succeeded.  ;-) <br><br>  Well, almost everything.  I am happy to answer any questions.  =) </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/62370/">https://habr.com/ru/post/62370/</a></p>
