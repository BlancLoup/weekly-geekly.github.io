Let's take a look at what topics the guys picked at conferences last year and which reports got the best marks.

      Before we start looking at the best reports, something needs to be clarified.  Although the titles of our conferences contain the words Student / University, it is important to note that these are professional conferences, in fact designed for students working for Junior positions and looking for their way in the Java world.  <i>By the way, this is our first Java-TOP without Alexey @shipilev Shipilev :)</i> <br><br>  So, let's see which reports have collected the maximum response among young audiences: <br><br>  <b>Victor <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/users/gamussa/" class="user_link">gAmUssA</a> Gamov, "Distribute and conquer: an introduction to distributed systems"</b> <br>  The report by Senior Solution Architect from Hazelcast, which deals with distributed data processing (open-source in-memory data grid), includes both a general introduction and review of terms from the field of distributed computing, as well as specific code samples and live demos.  It is noteworthy that Victor did not dwell on basic examples, but also spoke about the pitfalls of different approaches to the organization of distributed systems. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/J68pBDicGII%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700022,15700186,15700191,15700248,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhgcvUXHfCaWeP_jjsPz484ExLD0aA" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  <b>Maxim Dorofeev, "Student syndrome: why are we doing everything at the last moment?"</b> <br>  If you have ever been visited by the thought ‚ÄúI will never postpone work on the last night before the deadline,‚Äù which you successfully ignored in a month, then this cheerful report is for you.  The report on the shelves lays out the causes of such behavior and gives food for thought about how to fix it. <br><br>  In general, if you do not have 50 minutes to watch, I do not recommend to start, because it is impossible to break away.  Leave bookmarks for the evening. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/qBzPXXsQOeo%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700022,15700186,15700191,15700248,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhhj6q9u2cwl82BByTBzHD-IA5Szmg" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  <b>Josh Long, Pivotal, "The Bootiful Microservice"</b> <br>  You will start the demo report, in which you and the speaker (one of the world's best live coders), with the development of a simple web application using Spring, and finish it with a secure messenger compiled in 1 hour.  I am glad that the reports are excellent "come" in English. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/YCRt5VjQSCc%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700022,15700186,15700191,15700248,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhggyOtME9iuN6kZo-M4lZJkl92TdQ" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  <b>Idel Pivnitsky, ‚ÄúWhat can open source give a student.</b>  <b>Squeeze the maximum pleasure and benefit "</b> <br>  A report for those who do not know where to start.  Great motivation if you think that a developer without experience is not needed by anyone.  Needed! <br>  In the video you will find an overview of support programs for novice developers from Google, Mozilla, KDE and many others;  instructions on how to start commit in Open-Source;  FAQ, why you are exactly suitable for working with Open Source;  selection of tools for this. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/Kw1gQTqFPVY%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700022,15700186,15700191,15700248,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhhwcMe6kku0PkehDRPnwyhGNxXJJA" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  <b>Baruch <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/users/jbaruch/" class="user_link">jbaruch</a> Sadogursky, Kirill <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/users/tolkkv/" class="user_link">tolkkv</a> Tolkachev, ‚ÄúBattle of tools for assembly - Maven vs Gradle‚Äù</b> <br>  Maven is the most popular tool for building Java applications.  Gradle is gaining popularity faster and soon will eclipse the leader.  In this report, we understand what is better?  Interactive, fun, affordable ‚Äî in this JavaOne Rock-Star format, Baruch Sadogursky and Kirill Tolkachev talk about popular build systems and the dangers they pose to themselves. <br><br>  In this video on live-examples, the guys discuss not only the criteria for choosing a system and approaches to assembly.  After the report you will understand (if you did not understand before).  what the assembly system is in general, what continuous integration is, what it integrates with, and how the abbreviation ‚ÄúCD‚Äù stands for. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/6tnefehAmj0%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700022,15700186,15700191,15700248,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhgLAcgXm0UNdAFf1QiQU-EfDWCXMQ" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  As you can see, the reports are completely different, and it pleases!  At the conference, everyone finds something interesting for himself: someone needs to learn more about the approaches and development tools, someone about free software and new technologies.  It can not but rejoice, there is interest.  The question is how this interest is satisfied. <br><br><h4>  <b>What do they get?</b> </h4><br>  In fact, students and novice developers have a place to roam: the Internet is full of video courses, training programs and internships.  However, it is much more difficult to find suitable courses that can help young professionals decide on the direction in which to grow.  Usually, this is either completely introductory information or training for those who want to deepen their knowledge in some area. <br><br>  At the beginning of the article we talked about the fact that Joker 2016 Student Edition is a professional conference, one of a kind.  Here, students in one day will be able to get a complete overview of the available paths in the Java world ( <s>but without Scala, but we are not sadists</s> ): from low-level performance studies to the latest tools.  And here students and juniors will not be treated like students, here they will be able to feel like professionals.  And it costs a lot. <br><br>  <b>What will happen on Joker 2016 Student Edition?</b> <br><br><img align="left" src="https://habrastorage.org/files/ea2/6f0/a12/ea26f0a1298445008eba412ca7873898.jpg">  <a href="http://jokerconf.com/"><b>Andres Almiray, Canoo Engineering AG - Java libraries</b></a> <br><br>  Dedicated to the 20th anniversary of Java, a review of the most popular and efficient Java libraries and frameworks from Java Champion with over 16 years of experience in software design and development.

But, while in the capitals give rock concerts, on the ground master the balalaika.  It is not always clear how to start making a system based on microservice architecture.  What problems await the architect and developers, what bottlenecks can meet and how to prepare for this?  Does it make sense to start with a monolith, or should I immediately break the system into microservices?  How to determine the boundaries that will arise between your microservices? <br><br>  In this report, Maxim will not only discuss the problem areas of microservice development, but will offer tips and solutions that will help correct or even avoid difficulties and, consequently, waste time and resources to correct them. <br><br><img align="left" src="https://habrastorage.org/files/da1/075/566/da10755665b542569867170911d523ab.png">  <a href="http://jokerconf.com/"><b>Sergey Vladimirov, Moscow Institute of Physics and Technology (GU) / Sbertech - Optimization: all is not gold ...</b></a> <br><br>  Do you think optimization is an assembler, a struggle for nanoseconds and a GC control?  Do not flatter yourself, most often in the code there are dozens of completely frivolous errors in the field of performance.  The report contains examples of real code optimization, when the changes in the algorithms used were accelerated 100 or more times: <br><ul><li>  Pattern matching.  How to check 1000+ line matching patterns per microsecond; </li><li>  Work with ORM, hidden connections and losses that even a poor person profiler will reveal; </li><li>  Batch.

Happened such that you could not understand why someone made a specific decision, not another?  Would you like to exclaim: "And I would have done even better!"?  If you thought about it, you will be interested to hear the story of how these questions arose from Alexander and Cyril and how they were solved in the conditions of a large corporation. <br><br>  During the report, the difficult questions that arise when making decisions about how the system will live and evolve will be discussed. <br><br>  Together with the listeners, Alexander and Cyril will do an exercise to create a "table of technologies" and its evolution.  They will also show how important the engineering solution is at any stage of the system‚Äôs development. <br><br><br><br><br><br><h4>  <b>Discussion areas and stands of sponsors.</b> </h4><br>  As in the big <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/company/jugru/blog/306468"><b>Joker</b></a> , there will be discussion zones on the Student Edition: one of the key pieces of our 2016 conferences.  In short - after the report, the speakers will answer questions for an hour, holivarit, if it is necessary and generally communicate with the participants in any way in a free format. <br><br>  Almost immediately, the guys will be able to meet and talk with developers and PMs from large IT companies, such as Odnoklassniki, Luxoft, T-Systems, EPAM, JetBrains and many others.  It is important to remember that at Joker SE they will speak with the participants not as with students / students, but with novice professionals - as practice of past conferences shows, this changes a lot both in the heads of the students and in the minds of employers. <br><br>  In order to immerse our young participants into the atmosphere of an ‚Äúadult‚Äù Joker, as well as give them the opportunity to communicate not only with fellow students, but also with experienced colleagues (more than 80% of Joker participants are Senior / Middle level developers), we conduct <a href="http://jokerconf.com/se.html"><b>Joker 2016 Student Edition</b></a> October 15, in parallel and on the same platform as the "adult¬ª Joker 2016. <br><br>  <i>Joke problem instead of a postscript: write in the comments, on what principle the participants of JPoint Student Day are placed in the picture below.</i> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/70c/773/13c/70c77313ce8e4c42a5315528dafe74b8.jpg"></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/308112/">https://habr.com/ru/post/308112/</a></p>
