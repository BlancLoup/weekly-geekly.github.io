  <section class="page js-page"><h1>All life is a game, maybe TD?</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Hello, residents of Friday and Habra.  I submit for your consideration 6 games of the Tower Defense genre, with my brief comments, there is no time to write in detail - it is necessary to ‚Äúdefend the towers‚Äù).  And there‚Äôs no need for detailing, it is better to try (in fact, to describe each TD separately, it makes no sense, since they are all made in one image and similarity).  But I want to warn you that it is very fascinating (!), You can easily get carried away and lose track of time), although ... it's a Friday. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  The goal of any TD is defense, of its fortress, diamonds, women.  Towers of help and sometimes magic-skills are given to you, try to place and choose them correctly.  It often happens like this: there are ordinary towers and towers against a separate type of monsters (creeps), for example against flying ones, but they are weak or generally ineffective against ordinary ones.  So, six TD this Friday. <br><br>  <b>1. Cursed Treasure</b> is my latest hobby.  There are only three types of towers, but each one improves and eventually evolves into a super tower).  The game has a tree of talents, each tree belongs to the same type of tower.  For example, the tree of demons, and the tower of demons is such a pyramid scorching with magma rays.  There is magic in the game, the use of which sometimes makes life extremely easy, and sometimes without any means.) <br><br> <a href="http://www.towerdefence.net/games-276-Cursed_Treasure.php"><img src="http://s39.radikal.ru/i084/1005/19/e02b5caf33ee.jpg" alt="image"></a>

      <b>2. Bloons 4</b> - the fourth part of the Bloons series, it is possible to register to save progress.  This is quite an old and successful series, I remember how excitingly they poured balls (baloons) at the very beginning of the series.  So, 12 types of towers, there is even an airplane that flies over the card, scattering darts and a frigate (sailboat) firing cores.  Each tower can be nehilo so improved, the last improvement is the most expensive and the most ultimatum.  Do not deny yourself the pleasure of playing Hard.) By the way, I recommend playing the same in the 3rd part, although it is almost the same, but it is also very playable. <br><br> <a href="http://www.towerdefence.net/games-254-Bloons_TD_4.php"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/6fb/4a1/85d/6fb4a185ddd36b8b1825a07d69b3af1a.jpg" alt="image"></a> <br><br>  <b>3. GemCraft Chapter Zero</b> is a rather serious game, briefly like this: several game modes, towers are a set of gems inserted into them.  Gemes come in different colors and types, inserting them into a tower can and should be combined, from this they get an additional effect.  And then there are mines that can also be upgraded and a tree of talents and many, many game hours) <br><br> <a href="http://www.towerdefence.net/games-231-Gemcraft_Chapter_Zero.php"><img src="http://i057.radikal.ru/1005/37/459643db11c0.jpg" alt="image"></a> <br><br>  <b>4. Warzone</b> - we are defending the checkpoint from the armies of the enemy, we have at our disposal 9 types of beautifully drawn guns and 4 types of auxiliary devices.  The task ... the task is always the same - to hold out for as long as possible.  Build machine guns and flamethrowers, put fencing enemies will be many and they will be of different types.  Fun game. <br><br> <a href="http://www.towerdefence.net/games-204-Warzone.php"><img src="http://i073.radikal.ru/1005/5f/4db343d7e583.jpg" alt="image"></a> <br><br>  <b>5. Vector TD</b> - in this game there is a battle of ... geometric shapes), like you - square vs triangle.  There are three lines of cannons, cannons can be improved, each cannon is strong against a separate type of enemy, but the rule is ‚Äúagainst scrap, there is no reception‚Äù.  For external simplicity hidden "fascinating plot (joke)", but in general the game is cool, otherwise it would not appear in this review! <br><br> <a href="http://www.towerdefence.net/games-29-Vector_TD.php"><img src="http://s57.radikal.ru/i156/1005/72/946bb49c0ef4.jpg" alt="image"></a> <br><br>  <b>6. Onslaught</b> - a game for several evenings, there are many types of towers in the game, new ones appear as you progress, you can make combinations of towers that gives a completely stunning effect (towers should be put next to each other in a certain order) up to new special effects.  The difficulty level is below average. <br><br> <a href="http://www.towerdefence.net/games-24-Onslaught.php"><img src="http://s43.radikal.ru/i101/1005/29/23446df4cb29.jpg" alt="image"></a> <br><br>  I must say that for me the first TD - was a card in WarCraft III, remember it)?  I also really liked Starcraft2.pro, they also talked about it on Habr√©, but I couldn‚Äôt play it, try <a href="http://starcraft2.pro/tower-defense">starcraft2.pro/tower-defense</a> yourself (there is a portable version <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/games/67340/">http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/games/67340/</a> ) .  Information collected (played) here: <a href="http://towerdefence.net/">towerdefence.net</a> - a huge (possibly the largest) collection of TD games, there are offline versions.  Good luck. <br><br>  PS Yesterday I was thinking about TD in my life, imagine that the road is a map, and the traffic cops are towers, straight one to one TD.  And the way of life as a whole, all people have ‚Äútheir own way‚Äù, there will certainly be towers on it: an examination commission at the university, an interview, work performance, etc.  Perhaps nonsense. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/94722/">https://habr.com/ru/post/94722/</a></p>
