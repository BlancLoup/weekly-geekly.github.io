  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Despite the controversial results of the division of Hewlett Packard, Xerox is also split into two companies</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xerox">Xerox</a> decided to split into two companies.  Today the corporation must announce this officially.  Today she will publish fresh financial results. <br><br>  After the division, one of the companies will deal exclusively with the production of printing equipment, while the other will focus on providing professional services and servicing business clients.  It <a href="http://www.wsj.com/articles/xerox-plans-to-split-in-two-1454015527">clarifies</a> The Wall Street Journal, this decision was made possible after the acquisition of Xerox company <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Affiliated_Computer_Services">Affiliated Computer Services</a> , which is engaged in the provision of services. <br><br>  It was bought by Xerox back in 2010 for $ 5.6 billion.  This deal was an attempt by Xerox to expand its operations and make a profit by providing services for the business.  The CEO of Ursula Burns, who initiated this scheme, defended it to the last, but after that she revised her position.  But did the decline in sales and the decline in the value of Xerox shares make the management think about such drastic changes? <a name="habracut"></a>

      The New York Times <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2016/01/29/business/dealbook/pressured-by-icahn-xerox-will-split-in-2.html%3F_r%3D0">writes</a> that investor Carl Aikan influenced the decision.  He acquired an 8.13% stake in Xerox and stated that the company's securities were undervalued.  He also noted that he met with her leadership and gave them his thoughts on how to increase the quotes.  It is known that the aforementioned investor was one of the initiators of the separation of <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/EBay">eBay</a> from <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/PayPal">PayPal</a> . <br><br>  <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hewlett-Packard">Hewlett-Packard Corporation</a> in the past was the largest manufacturer of PCs and servers in the world.  But the company's business was getting worse and worse.  In 2011, HP executives thought about separation.  And in 2015, this process was <a href="http://megamozg.ru/post/20878/">completed</a> . <br><br>  New <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HP_Inc">HP Inc.</a>  received all the assets for the development and production of personal computing systems and printers.  Hewlett Packard Enterprise ( <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hewlett_Packard_Enterprise">HPE</a> ) went to the entire corporate business.  For the corporation, these changes have become the largest since it bought Compaq with 63,700 employees in 2002 for $ 25 billion. <br><br>  However, after the division of the corporation into two companies, the affairs of each of them are not easy.  So far, business restructuring <a href="https://megamozg.ru/post/22148/">does not give</a> positive results.  Taking into account the ambiguous results of the division of Hewlett Packard, it is difficult to say what Xerox is counting on in this sense.  Perhaps more eloquently, we will later be told about this new financial report and management. <br><br>  While it is known that Xerox quotes fell by 28% yoy.  At the moment, the entire company is estimated at $ 9.3 billion.  In the past three years, its annual profit amounted to about $ 1 billion. <br><br>  Xerox was founded in 1906.  Then she worked under the Haloid brand and initially specialized in the production of photographic paper.  Her story changed after the acquisition of a copy machine patent.  In 1949, the first model was released, called Xerox, and after another 12 years, the company changed its name and began to get more profit due to the massive sales of copiers.  Now in the Xerox company 147 thousand employees worldwide work. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/298260/">https://habr.com/ru/post/298260/</a></p>
