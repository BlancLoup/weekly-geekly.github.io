And usually there is no problem ... except for one.  Her name is "webmoney".  No, they are a great company, they can earn money and provide, perhaps even a convenient, service.  It would seem that there is nothing difficult, received a personal passport and go!  But alas, if you live in a small town, then the path to obtaining a certificate is full of surprises and surprises. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Somehow this was the case, a year ago, I overcame my love for their abstruse, super protected from people service.  And I decided to start using it.  Registered, went to receive a formal certificate.  And then on you, it turns out, I, ay yay, do money laundering, and I banned it for life.  As it turned out 8 years ago, I was already registered in the system, which is probably already a crime.  Yes your well ..., I thought, and went to Yandex money, hoping that the competition heals and from insanity. <br><br>  And so the years go by.  There are still a lot of webmoney users.  And we must somehow receive payments from them.  A good webmoney company puts special demands on the design of the site and what's even more surprising is the personal passport of the site owner, even if you use a payment aggregator.  No one else has such requirements, but they are apparently special to them, but oh well.  Long correspondence with support and Hurray!  Here is the coveted Formal Passport in my hands. <br><br>  Go to the next level.  The task is to get a personal certificate. <br>  Our town is small and the centers of issuing certificates have not started yet.  But there is a way out, go to the notary to certify the application to send them and everything will be the type of top.  I run to the notary, certify the signature on the application, send, wait.  Two weeks later, the answer comes:

      ‚ÄúDocuments for obtaining a personal certificate for WMID 00000000000 received. <br>  The notary does not provide information about the authenticity of the signature, in connection with this certificate you will not be issued. " <br><br>  As it turned out, they called the notary and asked to give them a certificate.  The notary naturally sends them, as the law does not have such a right.  And all this is a dead end. <br><br>  He cited an excerpt from the law of the Russian Federation on the notariate, but alas, the answer is: "You somehow agree with the notary to answer us, otherwise we will not give you a personal certificate."  But oh my goodness!  How can I negotiate with a notary about a violation of the law, is this an article ?! <br><br>  But the competition has been growing in recent years, Qiwi is pressing on the left, Yandex on the right, and liqpay has been attached to the back.  It is now easier for me to refuse to accept webmoney than to get involved in this insanity.  Ways of payment in RuNet, and so abound.  What do you think, is the game worth the candle? <br><br>  PS Excerpt from Article 5, Law of the Notary of the Russian Federation: <br>  "Notary on duty, as well as persons <br>  working in a notary's office is prohibited to disclose information, to disclose <br>  the documents that became known to them in connection with the notarial <br>  actions, including after the addition of powers, or dismissal, for <br>  Except as provided in this Basics. <br>  Information (documents) about notarial actions performed may <br>  issued only to persons on behalf of or on whose instructions these <br>  actions. <br>  Certificates of notarial acts are issued on request. <br>  court, prosecutor‚Äôs office, investigative bodies in connection with <br>  criminal or civil proceedings, as well as upon request <br>  arbitration court in connection with disputes which are in its permission.
