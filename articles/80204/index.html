  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Allods Online. Inside view</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  With the purchase of Astrum Nival'a Mile.rushami, the commercialization of the ‚Äúfree‚Äù (yes, the subscription fee is still not taken!) Of the Allods Online project is gaining momentum at an accelerated pace.  Everything you read <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/games/50536/">about Allods Online</a> before the Open Beta Testing is implemented less, although there are a lot of small and not very flaws available (I won‚Äôt go far, but the raid interface is still in poor condition. Crafting exists only by name - There are practically no normal things in the craft). <br><br>  Observing the New Year fever thought - what will the developers prepare for the New Year?  It turned out that the amount of the purchase was large and there was not enough salary for programmers and designers, or for some other reason, but the company decided to squeeze a bit of dough from the players.  What was done for this? <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  1. High-level content. <br><br>  As it was, and remains unfinished.  And this is despite the fact that the number of players who have reached the maximum level is already a lot.  The system of heroic adventures (quest to the instance for a group of high-level (38+) players) by the new year was spared the possibility of abandoning the quest and going through it again (in order to get loot from the bosses in the instance, but not close the adventure for a day).  Thus instansov any more became.  The five existing players are traversed by a group of well-coordinated and ‚Äúdressed‚Äù players (and they were dressed according to the scheme outlined above - with the help of repeated instances) passing these instances in 4-6 hours.  And a group assembled at random or ‚Äúnot dressed‚Äù does not actually have any instance to go through.  As a result, we have the following item: 
      <br>
        <script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>
        <ins class="adsbygoogle"

          data-ad-layout="in-article"

          (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
        </script>
      <br>
      2. Ships and Astral. <br><br>  Before NG additional quests were introduced to accelerate the construction of the ship.  These quests are done simply - you buy the required number of items in the Rarity Shop (the local name is Item Moll) and you hand them over to the NPC.  At the maximum, about 2000 rubles are wrung out from you and you reduce the construction of the ship by 20 days (maximum).  Let me remind you that with a base period of 100 days, this is very significant.  Of course, there is also a free version with two daily quests that reduce each time of construction by one day.  Given that one of the quests involves getting things from a heroic adventure, and a ‚Äúnot dressed‚Äù player cannot get it in either solo or in a group, only one quest remains. <br><br>  Also considering a permanent group of players of 6 people (maximum), given that each of them may have already laid the ship at the shipyard, then having 5 heroic adventures, one of the group members flies with one of the quests to speed up the construction. <br><br>  Further, considering the Astral Islands and the adventures on them, you understand that again, a ‚Äúnot dressed‚Äù group of players cannot survive in Astral and do not complete quests on the Astral Islands. <br><br>  3. In-game currency. <br><br>  In connection with the recent pre-New Year changes, it was virtually impossible to get game currency in sufficient quantities to build a ship, which is no less than 1,500 gold.  What was done for this?  But that - the treasure system was actually abolished.  If a player previously could collect several treasures and get high-level things from them and put them up for auction at a normal in-game price, then due to the latest changes, things from the chests are now tied to the bag and you can only sell them to NPCs at a ridiculous price.  Plus the chance of dropping a really good thing has become very low.  And considering that you can now collect a maximum of 3 treasures, the player‚Äôs daily income from the chests can be no more than 30-50 gold at best.  Considering that to get the number of chests other than one, you need to use a special ingredient. The action of which is 30 minutes and can be obtained either for real money or by completing a quest that is not difficult but lengthy.  In principle, it is possible to earn a craft in view of the competition between crafters and the constant price reduction due to competition.  As a result, the crafter must either negotiate and keep prices at an acceptable level, or continue to sell items at their own cost. <br><br>  4. Life after death. <br><br>  Also, with the latest changes, the PvP system was somewhat eliminated (would you agree is strange for an online game?).  A penalty was introduced after death (for many online games this is not an innovation, but it is mainly aimed at balancing between warring players, rather than pushing money from them), which firstly contradicts the legend of some races in the game - I will explain, the penalty is called Fear of Death, but a quote from off.sayta from the section "Death in the game" <br><br><blockquote>  Residents of Sarnaut treat death on the battlefield differently, but, in general, quite philosophically.  For gibberling, death is just an annoying misunderstanding, for the Kanians, a break from everyday worries, and elves see death as the culminating moment of their earthly existence. <br><br>  Similar subjects to death in battle are experienced by subjects of the Empire: the average orc gives it no more significance than losing the favorite goblin-ball team in the final match for the Empire Cup.  It is sad, but the resolute Hadagan people are resigned to accept their life: for them it is just a hindrance on the way to a great goal.  And only the people of Zem, for understandable reasons, value death above life, for it is immortality for those who have risen from the dead. </blockquote><br><br>  Secondly, it is proposed to remove this ‚Äúcurse‚Äù by paying a special NPC not a small amount of game currency, which was not very easy to get, or (attention!) Using a special ingredient to get which, as I said, you can either get for the quest (one unit that is enough for 30 minutes), or for real money.  It turns out that the developers are pushing with all their might, although not forcing for now, to buy this special ingredient. <br><br>  After analyzing the data of ‚Äúinnovation‚Äù from, as I suspect, marketers Mile.Ru, I have no desire to continue playing, let alone invest at least a ruble in this project (I vote with a ruble so to speak), but I will follow the project as I‚Äôm not indifferent and his world managed to catch my fancy. <br><br>  PS By the way, having written above about voting, I remembered that there is a voting system in the game, in the Shop you can get a free vote ‚ÄúFor‚Äù and a vote ‚ÄúAgainst‚Äù, but as far as I know this system has never been used by developers.  Here is such a democracy in Russian - you can vote, but there is no sense from this.  =) <br></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/80204/">https://habr.com/ru/post/80204/</a></p>
