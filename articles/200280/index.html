  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Hello and welcome</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Hello, dear users.  Welcome to our corporate blog, the HackStore team.  On Habr√© was already a <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/180457/">post</a> about our application store, so I would like to welcome you and tell you what has changed since the publication. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Perhaps the most important thing that has emerged in our country is people.  During these few months we were joined by several wonderful people, each of whom found something that could be useful for our project and perfectly fit into our team.  First is our designer.  At this point in time, we are engaged in a new version of our store, and design is something that we have been working on for a very long time and with which we paid a lot of attention.  After all, the application should combine the convenience and beauty, and really want to hope that we could achieve this.  I can not very beautifully describe what you need to look, and the saying was ... <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/6e7/fe3/c86/6e7fe3c86b4f7775fbf09e2b5768b3df.png"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/70e/e5f/066/70ee5f066e54f78b00844fbfb6362418.jpg">

        <ins class="adsbygoogle"
          style="display:block; text-align:center;"
          data-ad-layout="in-article"
          data-ad-format="fluid"
          data-ad-client="ca-pub-6974184241884155"

      <br>
      Secondly, our team has been replenished with developers who are currently engaged in the implementation of a new application interface.  Thirdly, wonderful editors are working with us, who are looking for interesting acquaintances for us, helping us to develop the HackStore. <br><br>  But despite this, we continue to look for help in working on the project, we still need developers who would help improve what is not yet improved and speed up the development process as a whole, we need specialists who would engage in attracting potential partners and further promotion our application on a global scale. <br><br>  Probably, as in any other young team, we are interested in working and having fun, even though we all live in completely different cities and even in three different countries.  But even territorial distribution practically does not interfere with our joint work.  Let many of us have not so much experience, but thanks to this project we learn from our own mistakes, look at competitors and learn from their mistakes, make pleasant acquaintances with various software developers with whom we are trying to establish mutually beneficial relationships.  We are not conducting any promotions at the moment and are not engaged in the promotion of our application, since all efforts have been devoted to the development of a new version, but we would not like that, that someone would have thought that the project had faded away, no, we are full of strength, ideas and we embody them, and also very much hope that in the near future, we will be able to please you even more, attracting developers to our store, improving HackStore itself. <br><br>  I would like to separately contact the software developers for Mac OS, which are also present here on Habr√© - we are open for cooperation and just for communication, we are interested in your opinion about our project, we want everyone who does not go to the official MAS to not deprived of "a single, convenient point" of contact with the end user.  If you want to cooperate with us, we will be happy to tell you about our ideas and methods of software delivery to consumers, and I hope you do not want to say goodbye to us. <br><br>  We welcome your comments, suggestions and advice, write - we always answer! <br><br>  Website: <a href="http://hack-store.com/">hack-store.com</a> <br><br>  We are in social networks: <br>  Our <a href="https://twitter.com/HackStoreTeam">Twitter</a> <br>  Our <a href="https://www.facebook.com/pages/HackStore-Team/476054662412666">FaceBook</a> <br>  Our <a href="http://vk.com/hackstoreteam">VKontakte</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/200280/">https://habr.com/ru/post/200280/</a></p>
