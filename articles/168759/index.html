Accordingly, once upon a time, I installed myself a ‚Äúwatch‚Äù Windows 8 developer preview ...

      I really liked it (system) pretty much - I just didn‚Äôt bother with the Start button.  Quickly, competently without any questions, I got up, I decided to solve all deployment issues, and I worked very smoothly. <br>  And her desktop version looked very advanced - the taskmanager a'la Russinovich caused a special delight;) <br><br>  However, after a while, this &lt;sensored&gt; took me a screw nafig; (("Well, oh well," - I thought, developer preview all the same: help colleagues - send a dump .... and thought a second time .... and the third was no longer the strength to swear. <br>  Yeah - returned 7-ku. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  But nevertheless, it is necessary to somehow sniff the WDK8 (by the way, for the first time the installation is not in the form of a printed description: ‚Äúwhere are the ways to write‚Äù;) - I recommend) and see what awaits us. <br>  Here it should be noted that I, unfortunately, do not have the possibility of normal virtualization, so we put all this stuff on a physical machine. <br><br>  Well, published a Customer preview - respectively, I bundled got a new look of BSOD. <br>  By the way, somewhere at the same time and aero disappeared.  By the way, I like it better. <br><br>  At the same time, life went on as usual, a little defined by the OS on my old (3 years) laptop.  At the end of August server 2012 appeared in the set of virtual machines azure, which was immediately deployed. <br>  What struck first of all was the experience of saving.  I periodically transferred (usually at the end of the month) VMs into extra small mode (which is 768MB of memory and 1 shared core).  After such abuse, IIS, SQL, etc., feel fine. <br><br>  Hmm, now turn to the main topic. <br>  And why not use Windows server 2012 as a system on the old laptop (4Gb DDR2 RAM, Intel T4300 @ 2100 MHz, 2 Core ...) <br><br>  Autumn came, msdn didn‚Äôt come with yellow leaves, but the image of windows server 2012. Let's install! <br>  The first admiration is that the default interface is not ‚Äúmetro‚Äù - this is a ctrl-alt-del request without a domain (as it was in NT3.51, if I'm not mistaken) <br>  The first disappointment - what the hell is the resolution on the display; ((((((((((then installed drivers from the manufacturer for win7, and later MS appeared)) <br>  So.  Here is the first problem, the usual one.  The driver for wi-fi of this laptop even Ax does not see.  Well, I know that - I boldly slip a flash drive ...  - ‚ÄúHow see?‚Äù <br><br>  ‚Ä¢ By default, server 2012 does not have the WLAN feature. <br>  So go to Server Manager&gt; Add Role and Feature Wizard -&gt; Futures -&gt; Wireless LAN Services, install.  After that, we set up the network as usual. <br>  Whew, this is the most important.  Once there is a network you can google. <br><br>  Well, yes, of course, you can.  If there is enough patience for each sneeze confirmation button to press.  In addition, the problem of displaying ‚Äúplain html‚Äù in the ‚ÄúHelp Viewer‚Äù also applies to this setting. <br>  ‚Ä¢ The question is solved simply: ‚ÄúServer Manager&gt; Local Server&gt; PROPERTIES&gt; IE Enhanced Security Configuration‚Äù is set to Off (if it does not help for the help viewer, then manually enable IE-&gt; Internet Options to allow scripts). <br>  And now, when everything is already working, you should create a user in order not to litter the Administrator. <br><br>  ‚Ä¢ In addition to being added to the local administrators group of this user, you should allow the user to install software. <br>  By the way, it‚Äôs interesting, looking ahead, I want to note that the System prohibits doing something in the application store from the built-in account (Administrator) - I didn‚Äôt even try to edit it. <br>  So, now we are working in a normal form, it seems like 2008K2 and win7. <br>  Ooooops, what about new technologies? <br><br>  Well, yes, we want to work. <br>  ‚Ä¢ Using GUI - there too <br>  Server Manager&gt; Add Role and Feature Wizard -&gt; Futures -&gt; User Interface and Infrastructure <br><br>  ‚Ä¢ After that, without seeing your favorite movie, and even without listening to the best mp3, we tick the ‚ÄúServer Manager&gt; Add Role and Feature Wizard -&gt; Futures -&gt; Media Foundation‚Äù <br><br>  ‚Ä¢ We‚Äôll add a final touch - I‚Äôm used to the fact that by ‚Äúclosing the lid‚Äù the computer goes to sleep, but by ‚Äúpressing power‚Äù it makes hibernate and at 5% of the charge is also not a Shutdown.  Little is applicable to the server, however we set up the notebook, not the failover cluster - so the ‚Äúpowercfg / HIBERNATE‚Äù command helps a lot. <br><br>  Actually, I can no longer remember all the settings that I applied to Windows Server 2012 Standard, but right now he is working on the laptop described above, it works VS 2012 Pro, IIS 8, MSSQL 2012 Web, MS Word 2013. <br><br>  Memory by Task manager: In use: 1.7Gb, Committed: 2.0, Paged pool: 208 MB. <br><br>  And summing up, there is a wonderful system that will allow you to work in the usual way and scale in all directions. <br>  This system can be obtained by subscription msdn.  In Server 2012, well, just a huge amount of possibilities (to finish according to your taste), which is really better;) <br><br>  Of the annoying factors - not only does metro start by default, so is Server Manager at the entrance to the desktop. <br>  Most likely it can be won - but I did not watch. <br><br>  PS: Colleagues, I really do not remember all the forks that I had to face in the settings and policies, so ask and remind. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/168759/">https://habr.com/ru/post/168759/</a></p>
