The huge popularity of the approach caused a flurry of publications, which resulted in a lot of conjectures, inaccuracies and frankly incorrect information.  Including, there is a perception that one landing page is enough.  At the same time, they overlook the fact that a set of thought-out landings allows us to diversify directions from promotion and reach a large audience of users. <br><br>  Each new page is another opportunity to be found in a search engine, a chance to sell a product and get a customer.  Just do not get involved in, between the "many" and "enough" a huge difference. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h5>  Why should there be a lot of them? </h5><br>  <a href="http://offers.hubspot.com/marketing-benchmarks-from-7000-businesses%3F__hstc%3D20629287.9a56d950dd5949e7ef7e751efc4701ed.1399406364242.1401311377300.1401738440265.9%26__hssc%3D20629287.2.1401738440265%26__hsfp%3D3841261917">The study</a> , during which more than 7,000 companies were evaluated, covered various aspects of Internet marketing, and it provided interesting data on the relationship between the number of landings and the lead growth index. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/aa2/867/4cd/aa28674cd58ac9854b0f2491b3aac395.png"><br><br>  Most companies stop at 5-10 pages, and without getting noticeable results from increasing their number.  At the same time, the real effect begins to appear with an increase in the number of pages from 15 and more, and the real growth is observed when the line crosses 40+.

      The same information in the context of B2B and B2C business allows us to evaluate the effectiveness of increasing the number of landing pages for various areas of electronic commerce. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/fe2/585/f04/fe2585f046e167e2f6e0d13f195cb7c1.png"><br><br>  It is easy to see that when overcoming the turn of 40 pages, first of all, B2B companies win. <br><br><h5>  Why does such an effect occur? </h5><br>  There are several reasons for the correlation between the growth of the number of landing pages and the conversion: <br><br>  <b>1) More landing pages - more features.</b> <br><br>  Simply put, the more landing pages you have, the more opportunities you have to turn site visitors into potential customers.  The more landing pages you have, the more landing pages will be indexed in the search.  And if in a search engine a visitor gets a result that sends him straight to your landing page, you significantly shorten the path of turning a visitor into a buyer.  He does not need to deal with your site and look for CTA, he immediately gets access to the "magic button", while having all the necessary information about the product, which is presented on the landing page. <br><br>  <b>2) Each new page is a portion of new information.</b> <br><br>  The more landing pages, the more approaches you can use to present your offers and products.  The correct information about your products is the basis of your marketing strategy, without which you will fail.  By launching various options for pages, you can use several approaches to presenting information: what you tell the visitor and how you tell it.  However, you are not limited as in the situation with the site, no one forces you to choose.  If one page resulted in 1000 clients, and the second is only 100, this does not mean that you need to stop using the second page. <br><br>  <b>3) This is a great way to segmentation.</b> <br><br>  Segmentation of the market according to certain criteria is one of the best methods of point impact on a group of visitors.  Due to the increase in landings, you can work with each group without regard to the other, which will allow you to use materials that are close to the target audience and will have a high impact on visitors. <br><br><h5>  How to do it? </h5><br>  <b>Create more offers</b> <br><br>  No matter how good your product is, you should always have a few spare options.  You can divide your offer into several and offer both a range of services and each of them separately.  You can provide related services or something else, because there is always something else. <br><br>  <b>Modifying existing pages</b> <br><br>  Experiment with the design, make a minimal and wow version of your page.  Change its content.  Put other accents and priorities.  Make sure that your page uses those factors that the original did not use. <br><br>  Again, the number is not a decisive factor, you can not just rivet pages and wait for customers.  Each of the landings should be analyzed.  You need to understand what exactly and exactly how it works and brings you profit, not in order to reduce the number of landing pages, but in order for new pages to be even more effective than previous ones. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/225067/">https://habr.com/ru/post/225067/</a></p>
