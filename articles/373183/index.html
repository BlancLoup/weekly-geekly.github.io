The purpose of the research was simple - to generate an electric field in one place so that it could then be detected by its devices at a distance.  At the same time, attempts were made to supply energy at a distance not only to highly sensitive sensors for voltage detection, but also to significant energy consumers.  So, in 1904 at the exhibition of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louisiana_Purchase_Exposition">St.</a>  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louisiana_Purchase_Exposition">Louis World's Fair</a> was awarded a prize for the successful launch of a 0.1-horsepower aircraft engine, carried out at a distance of 30 m.

      The ‚Äúelectricity‚Äù gurus are known to many (William Sturgeon, Michael Faraday, Nicolas Joseph Callan, James Clerk Maxwel, Heinrich Hertz, Mahlon Loomas, etc.), but few know that the Japanese researcher Hidetsugu Yagi used a self-developed antenna to transmit energy.  In February 1926 he published the results of his research, in which he described the structure and method of tuning the Yagi antenna. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/703/a38/9bb/703a389bbfb68db37747bc1b826d0761.jpg" alt="image"></div><br><br>  Note: I deliberately did not mention about <a href="http://library.raikevich.com/tesla/01.htm">Tesla Nikola (Nikola Tesla)</a> : it was written a lot and a lot. <br><br>  Very serious work and projects were carried out in the USSR in the period 1930-1941 and in parallel at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3DGEvSalo1uRQ">Drittes Reich</a> .  Naturally, mainly for military purposes.  Naturally, mainly for military purposes: the defeat of enemy personnel, the destruction of military and industrial infrastructure, etc. <br>  In the USSR, serious work was also being done on the use of microwave radiation to prevent surface corrosion of metal structures and products. <br>  But this is a separate story.  Again you have to climb into the dusty attic. <br><br>  One of the greatest Russian physicists of the last century, the Nobel Prize winner, Academician <a href="http://kapitza.ras.ru/index.php%3Fcont%3Dkap%26lang%3Dru">Peter Leonidovich Kapitsa</a> devoted part of his creative biography to exploring the prospects for using microwave oscillations and waves to create new and highly efficient energy transfer systems.  In 1962, in the preface to his <a href="">monograph,</a> he wrote <br><blockquote>  <i>"... I want to remind you that electrical engineering, before coming to the service of the power industry, in the last century dealt widely only with telecommunication issues (telegraph, signaling, etc.). It is likely that history will repeat: now the electronics are mainly used for radio communication purposes, but its future lies in solving major energy problems</i> . <i>"</i> </blockquote><br><br>  From the long list of fantastic technical ideas implemented in the twentieth century, only the dream of wireless transmission of electric energy continued to remain unfulfilled.  Detailed descriptions of the energy rays in science fiction novels teased engineers with their obvious need, and at the same time the practical complexity of implementation. <br>  But the situation gradually began to change for the better. <br><br>  In 1964, an expert in the field of microwave electronics, William C.Brown, first tested a device (helicopter model) capable of receiving and using microwave energy in the form of direct current, thanks to an antenna array consisting of half-wave dipoles, each of which is loaded on high-efficiency Schottky diodes. <br><br>  In 1964, William C. Brown demonstrated on the CBS channel in the Walter Cronkite News program his model of a helicopter, which received enough energy to fly from a microwave radiator. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/80d/958/12a/80d95812a3b0d22884e3ad849eeb6f95.png" alt="image"></div><br>  Already by 1976, William Brown transferred the power of 30 kW to the microwave beam at a distance of 1.6 km with an efficiency of more than 80%. <br><br>  The tests were conducted in the laboratory and commissioned by <a href="http://www.raytheon.com/">Raytheon Co.</a> <br>  Read in detail (in English): <br>  <a href="http://www.iosrjournals.org/iosr-jeee/Papers/Vol4-issue5/D0452428.pdf">Microwave Power Transmission - IOSR Journals</a> <br>  <a href="http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/00222739.1966.11688626">The microwave powered Helicopter.</a>  <a href="http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/00222739.1966.11688626">William C.

Glaser proposed to place large solar panels in a geostationary orbit, and transfer the energy (5-10 GW) generated by them to the Earth‚Äôs surface with a well-focused microwave beam. , then convert it into DC or AC energy at a technical frequency and distribute to consumers. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/b70/e26/d9f/b70e26d9fce4c04234266567d37a5616.png" alt="image"></div><br>  Such a scheme made it possible to use an intense flux of solar radiation existing in a geostationary orbit (~ 1.4 kW / sq. M.) And transmit the received energy to the Earth's surface continuously, regardless of the time of day and weather conditions [2-12].  Due to the natural inclination of the equatorial plane to the ecliptic plane with an angle of 23.5 degrees, the satellite located in the geostationary orbit is illuminated by solar radiation flow almost continuously except for short periods of time near the days of the spring and autumn equinox, when this satellite falls into the Earth‚Äôs shadow.  These periods can be accurately predicted, and in total they do not exceed 1% of the total duration of the year. <br><br>  The frequency of electromagnetic oscillations of the microwave beam should correspond to the ranges that are allocated for use in industry, research and medicine.  If this frequency is chosen to be 2.45 GHz, then meteorological conditions, including dense clouds and heavy precipitation, have practically no effect on the efficiency of energy transfer.  The range of 5.8 GHz is tempting because it makes it possible to reduce the size of the transmitting and receiving antennas.  However, the influence of meteorological conditions here requires further study. <br><br>  The current level of development of microwave electronics suggests a rather high value of the efficiency of microwave energy transfer from the geostationary orbit to the Earth's surface - about 70-75%.  The diameter of the transmitting antenna is usually chosen to be 1 km, and the terrestrial rectenna is 10 km x 13 km in size for a latitude of 35 degrees.  SCES with an output power level of 5 GW has a radiated power density in the center of the transmitting antenna of 23 kW / sq. M, in the center of the receiving - 230 W / sq. M. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/a01/455/dc8/a01455dc8dc7eff2cba842652bb337c3.png" alt="image"></div><br>  Various types of solid-state and vacuum microwave generators for the SCES transmitting antenna were investigated.  William Brown showed, in particular, that magnetrons well mastered by industry and intended for microwave ovens can also be used in SCES transmitting antenna arrays if each of them is provided with its own negative feedback circuit in relation to the external clock signal (so called Magnetron Directional Amplifier (MDA). <br><br>  <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%25A0%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BA%25D1%2582%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BD%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B0">Rektenna</a> is a highly efficient receiving-transforming system, however, the low-voltage diodes and the need for their sequential switching can lead to avalanche-like breakdowns.  A cyclotron energy converter makes it possible to substantially eliminate this problem. <br><br>  The SCES transmitting antenna can be a reverse-re-emitting active antenna array based on slotted waveguides.  Its coarse orientation is carried out mechanically; for accurate guidance of the microwave beam, the pilot signal emitted from the receiving center is used and analyzed on the surface of the transmitting antenna by the network of relevant sensors. <br><br>  From 1965 to 1975  A scientific program led by Bill Brown was successfully completed, demonstrating the possibility of transmitting 30 kW of power over a distance of more than 1 mile with an efficiency of 84%. <br><br>  In 1978‚Äì1979, the first government research program aimed at determining the SCES perspectives was carried out in the United States under the leadership of the Department of Energy (DOE) and NASA (NASA). <br><br>  In 1995-1997, NASA again returned to the discussion of the prospects of SCES, based on the progress of technology achieved by that time. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/ada/a00/7fd/adaa007fd09d9a25e29d08542cd95122.jpg" alt="image"></div><br>  Research was continued in 1999‚Äì2000 ( <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_Solar_Power_Exploratory_Research_and_Technology_program">Space Solar Power (SSP) Strategic Research &amp; Technology Program</a> ). <br><br>  The most active and systematic research in the field of SCES was conducted by Japan.  In 1981, under the guidance of professors M.Nagatomo (Makoto Nagatomo) and S.Sasaki (Susumu Sasaki), the Institute of Space Research of Japan began research on the development of a prototype SCES with a power level of 10 MW, which could be created using existing launch vehicles.  Creating such a prototype allows you to gain technological experience and prepare the basis for the formation of commercial systems. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/bbd/32d/b30/bbd32db307643725956b61e600d11ec5.jpg" alt="image"></div><br>  The project was named SCES2000 (SPS2000) and received recognition in many countries around the world. <br><br>  <i>In 2008, Marin Soljaƒçiƒá, an associate professor at the department of physics at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), was awakened from sweet sleep by insistent squeaking of a mobile phone.</i>  <i>‚ÄúThe phone did not stop talking, demanding that I set it to charge,‚Äù says Soldzhachich.</i>  <i>Tired and unwilling to get up, he began to dream that the phone, once at home, would start charging by itself</i> . <br><br>  So <a href="http://witricity.com/">WiTricity</a> and WiTricity corporation appeared. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/361/1f9/99c/3611f999c68bf5e2ed9ff181fde7f14d.jpg" alt="image"></div><br>  In June 2007, Marin Soljaƒçiƒá and several other researchers at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology reported on the development of a system in which a 60-watt light bulb was supplied from a source located at a distance of 2 m, and the efficiency was 40%. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/9b6/c31/7a4/9b6c317a4ebda1c63145ed38cdea9ad9.png" alt="image"></div><br>  According to the authors of the invention, this is not a ‚Äúpure‚Äù resonance of coupled circuits and is not a Tesla transformer with inductive coupling.  The radius of power transmission today is just over two meters, in the future - up to 5-7 meters. <br>  In general, scientists tested two fundamentally different schemes. <br>  <i>1. In an induction coil or electrical transformer that have a metal or air core, energy is transmitted by a simple electromagnetic coupling, called magnetic induction.</i>  <i>Using this method, the transmission and production of energy became possible at a considerable distance, but to obtain significant voltage in a similar way it was necessary to arrange two coils very closely.</i> <i><br></i>  <i>2. If magnetic resonance coupling is used, where both inductors are tuned to mutual frequency, considerable energy can be transferred to a considerable distance.</i> <br><br>  Similar technologies are frantically developed by other companies: Intel has demonstrated its WREL technology with an efficiency of up to 75% energy transfer.  In 2009, Sony showed off TV without a network connection.  Only one circumstance is alarming: regardless of the method of transmission and technical tricks, the energy density and field strength in the premises must be high enough to power the devices with a capacity of several tens of watts.  According to the developers themselves, there is no information on the biological effects on humans of such systems.  Given the recent appearance, and a different approach to the implementation of energy transfer devices, such studies are still coming, and the results will not appear soon.  And we can judge their negative impact only indirectly.  Something will disappear again from our dwellings, such as cockroaches. <br><br>  In 2010, Haier Group, a Chinese home appliance maker, unveiled its unique product at CES 2010 - a fully wireless LCD TV based on research by Professor Marina Solyachicha on wireless power transmission and wireless home digital interface ( <a href="http://www.whdi.org/">WHDI</a> ). <br><br>  In 2012-2015  Engineers at the University of Washington have developed technology to use Wi-Fi as an energy source to power portable devices and charge gadgets.  The technology is already recognized by Popular Science magazine as one of the best innovations of 2015.  The widespread adoption of wireless data transmission technology has in itself produced a real revolution.  And now it was the turn of the wireless transmission of energy over the air, which the developers at the University of Washington called <a href="https://homes.cs.washington.edu/~gshyam/Papers/powifi.pdf">PoWiFi</a> (from Power Over WiFi). <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/24f/0b5/20a/24f0b520a549f9d8b766427f7c823e6d.jpg" alt="image"></div><br>  At the testing stage, researchers were able to successfully charge small-capacity lithium-ion and nickel-metal hydride batteries.  Using the Asus RT-AC68U router and several sensors located at a distance of 8.5 meters from it.  These sensors just convert the energy of an electromagnetic wave into a direct current with a voltage from 1.8 to 2.4 volts, necessary for powering microcontrollers and sensor systems.  The peculiarity of the technology is that the quality of the working signal does not deteriorate.  Just reflash the router and you can use it as usual, plus supply power to low-power devices.  At one of the demonstrations, a small covert surveillance camera with low resolution was successfully powered, located more than 5 meters from the router.  Then 41% was charged fitness tracker Jawbone Up24, it took 2.5 hours. <br><br>  Tricky questions about why these processes do not adversely affect the quality of the network communication channel, the developers responded that this is possible due to the fact that the flash router, during its operation, sends energy packets to the channels that are not transmitting information.
