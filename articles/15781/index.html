  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Factory startups (continued)</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Detailing and development of the article <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blog/startup/28305.html">Startup Factory</a> . <br>  This publication consists of three parts: <br>  1. The main problem of startups. <br>  2. Comparative analysis of similar projects. <br>  3. Part three, emotional. <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  <strong>The main problem of startups.</strong> <br>  I described the problems in the first article, and now I want to separate the derivatives and root problems. <br>  Problems: <br>  Lack of ideas?  Is it a problem?  After my first publication, many admitted that they had ‚Äúdry‚Äù excellent, very promising ideas.  Most of them lack a thoughtful business part, but there are others. <br>  Low performance?  Yes, there is a problem, i.e.  they all talk a lot, they write, but they practically do nothing.  In fact, this is not a root problem, but a derivative.  To solve it, there is a lack of a good incentive (money) and an organizing link (administrator and work plan). <br>  Lack of cohesive team?  This is closer to the root, but this problem is a derivative, not a root one.  She solved.  Look at how many good specialists here on Habr√©, how many can be attracted from other places under a good project, if you solve the main, root problem - the lack of trust! <br>  Lack of trust is the root problem of startups!  Root because it is impossible to agree on it.  Trust can only be obtained in two ways: <br>  - first: with the experience of previous projects; <br>  - I will describe the second method in the third part of this article. <br><br>  <strong>Comparative analysis of similar projects.</strong> <br>  Immediately after the publication of the first article, many thought that I was reinventing the wheel, and gave references to the already existing models of these ‚Äúbikes‚Äù.  Let us analyze them in order: <br><blockquote>  ¬∑ <a href="http://startupindex.ru/">Runet Startup Rating</a> <br>  Requirements for investment targets: <br>  1. The presence of a registered legal entity in the form of a company or company. <br>  2. The presence of a registered domain name on the Internet, corresponding to the name of the legal entity or the brand of the project. <br>  3. The presence of a permanent client base or audience of the project (give additional target parameters for each group of target objects). <br>  4. Having a permanent team of full-time developers or a long-term contract with developers and / or contractor. <br>  5. Estimated project cost at the time of the decision to invest at least 1.5 million rubles. <br>  6. Availability of the forecast of the growth of the estimated cost of the project for 3 years. <br>  7. The estimated estimated cost of the project one year after the decision to invest: <br>  a.  not less than 3 million rubles; <br>  b.  or a relative increase in cost - not less than 2 times. <br></blockquote><br>  I think that from the listed requirements it is clear that this system is not for building startups, but for rating the ones created.  This is a tool for investors who want to invest in a startup.

    <blockquote>  ¬∑ <a href="http://www.ycombinator.com/">Ycombinator</a> is an American system, the analogue of which is now launched in Vienna. <br>  The brief essence of the system - you send a description of the idea and if the organizers like it, you can be invited to implement it.  In this case, you will be paid for accommodation and running costs, as well as provide space and equipment for work.  You yourself must create a product that will help you sell to the following investors, retaining in favor of the organizers from 2% to 10% (usually 6%). <br><br>  Some excerpts from the conditions and comments: <br>  Ycombinator is a self-organizing system whose goal is to finance a prototype and then transfer it to larger investors. <br>  The main task is to create conditions for work. <br>  The lack of a business plan is uncritical. <br>  You need to come as a team - the probability of accepting an application from one person is extremely low. <br>  Inability to work remotely. <br>  The possibility of accepting applications from foreigners. <br>  No guarantees of non-disclosure of ideas. </blockquote><br><br>  In my opinion, the system is not bad and solves the following tasks: <br>  1. getting ideas; <br>  2. getting talented performers; <br>  3. creation of conditions for effective work. <br><br>  However, for us the system has a number of limitations: <br>  1. if I have only an idea, but no team - to set aside; <br>  2. If I have the knowledge and skills, but there is no idea - to set aside; <br>  3. if I am not ready to give up everything and go to another country (for example, I‚Äôve come out of student age, I have children, ...) - leave; <br>  4. if I want to connect to the implementation of someone else's ideas - set aside; <br>  5. if I am not a programmer, but an offline profile specialist (sales, marketing, copywriting, ...) - set aside; <br>  6. there is a language barrier - set aside; <br>  7. Yes, and take on an opaque competitive basis.  If you are not ready for this - set aside. <br><br><blockquote>  ¬∑ <a href="http://www.hse-inc.ru/">Business Incubator at the Higher School of Economics, State University in Moscow</a> . <br>  The essence is the same, but they take only their students, we must live in Moscow and don‚Äôt pay extra money (although they don‚Äôt probably take any interest. At least I haven‚Äôt found any information about this). <br></blockquote><br>  It is clear that the above systems do not solve the main, initial problem - the creation of a team to work on the idea. <br><br>  <strong>Part three is emotional.</strong> <br>  Nervous and impressionable are advised to refrain from reading. <br><br>  I summarize the problems of startups.  Although there are people with excellent ideas, excellent programmers, excellent designers, people who are ready to invest money do not have the main thing - the teams.  And the team problem is the problem of trust. <br><br>  ‚ÄúI have an idea, but I will not tell it to anyone without prepayment, without a guarantee of nondisclosure!‚Äù <br>  ‚ÄúI am a professional programmer, but I do not move without money, without a contract.  I‚Äôll work all my life for s / n or will write a little quietly! ‚Äù <br>  ... <br><br>  This is the state of the Cold War - everyone is sitting in cold trenches with the ‚ÄúI am professional‚Äù flag turned out, and we are ready to shoot everyone who pops out.  Therefore, we are digging, we are trying to connect with the neighbor's trench and quietly agree.  But the chance that a neighbor and I will become a team capable of winning is low.  The chance that we will have time to dig a trench to another neighbor before the final general defeat is also low.  There is only one way - to declare a truce, get out of the trenches, get together, tell who can, and join teams to implement the most interesting projects.  This is the second way to obtain trust, called "credibility." <br><br>  You can start only with yourself.  I started - I trust you.  I post the idea and lay out the following and the next ... I laid out a description of my capabilities and qualifications.  Why do they write to me only in lichku or by mail?  Are we ashamed to say out loud?  Are we embarrassed to write about your qualifications?  There is nothing to be shy, I took the place of the most stupid in this forum, I do not know programming, I know five main tags in NTML and get confused in the syntax, I do not know English - I took the bottom line, there is nothing more to be shy.  <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blog/startups_factory/28721.html">Sign up!</a>  Let's make a <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blog/startups_factory/">factory</a> together! </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/15781/">https://habr.com/ru/post/15781/</a></p>
