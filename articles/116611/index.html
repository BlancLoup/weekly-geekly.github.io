Users make purchases on the site and track the sources of traffic and the achievement of goals is not difficult. 
      <br>

      However, the task of most of the sites is to attract new customers to purchase by phone.  And here it is almost impossible to track or measure the required traffic.  Especially if the proposed service or product - single consumption. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Sometimes, especially diligent site owners ask the callers different questions, for example, ‚ÄúDid you find us on Yandex.Direct?‚Äù And ‚ÄúOn what request did you find us?‚Äù.  The best and most correct answer to the caller is ‚Äúon the Internet!  (the rest is in a fog) ‚Äù. <br><br>  As a result, new customers are greatly annoyed by unnecessary questions, and the site owner does not understand what traffic brings these calls to him, and the advertising agency sells ‚Äúeverything, more‚Äù, so that at least something will bring results and the client will stay with it. <br><br><h5>  And here the zomboyaschik gave the idea </h5><br>  On TV, they demonstrated another domestic innovation - an electronic passport. <br>  The official, with clearly uncharacteristic for him optimism and energy, explained that Russian society was ‚Äúon the threshold of a new information age‚Äù.  I immediately remembered the biblical apocalypse with the numbering of all upright citizens ... <br><br>  So why not give each visitor a unique number?  Which he can easily and quickly call on the phone and it is desirable to do it yourself, without any questions. <br><br>  ‚Äú <b>What traffic gives calls and what does not?</b>  ‚Äù- this was the main question, answering which you can significantly increase the number of these calls and at the same time reduce the cost of advertising and website promotion. <br><br>  Omitting the technical details and months of development, Kaizen and Studio 42 represent the <a href="http://sitetarget.ru/">siteTarget</a> call measurement service (alpha version). <br><br>  The basis is the same simple idea - a visitor on the site sees a personal code (usually 4 digits) and calls him by phone.  At the end of the month, we load the received codes into the system and are surprised to find out what kind of traffic actually brings customer calls. <br><br><h5>  SiteTarget features </h5><br><ul><li>  Obtaining information on each visitor (analog webmaster.ru) in real time. </li><li>  Simple and visual reports: </li><li>  Traffic sources </li><li>  Search engines </li><li>  Search phrases </li><li>  Transitions from sites </li><li>  Advertising campaigns (Yandex.Direct, Runner, Google.Adwords) </li></ul><br>  After entering the call codes, reports show the effectiveness of traffic channels and the number of calls to each of them. <br><br>  You can invite friends to the system by simply entering their e-mail addresses. <br><br>  There are also some other important features planned for the beta release - automatic calculation of call costs, convenient billing and an affiliate program for advertising agencies.  We will tell about it in detail in the next post. <br><br><h5>  Terms of Use </h5><br>  siteTarget can be used completely free of charge for any number of sites during the first two months.  As a rule, this is enough to analyze incoming calls and significantly improve the effectiveness of your advertising. <br><br>  After the free period - you can continue to use the service for a fee.  Read more on the fare page. <br><br><h5>  As it was in practice.  The first experience of using the system </h5><br>  On the website of one of our clients, the medical center, a counter was installed.  Next to the phones they indicated that everyone who called the code from the site has a 5% discount.  Two months later, carefully recorded codes were entered into the system and ... surprised - the softest definition of our reaction. <br><br>  Having opened the reports, we saw that: <br><ul><li>  9 out of 10 promoted requests did not lead to calls (!) - that was the first conclusion. </li><li>  72% of calls bring articles that the client himself writes for the site and has long been considered a waste of time. </li><li>  The cost of 1 call from the direct - 562 p., From the runner - 114 p.  As they say, feel the difference. </li><li>  Etc. </li></ul><br>  PS: did the client stay with us (did he appreciate honesty?), But now he promotes completely different requests, reducing the budget by 40% while increasing the calls twice. <br><br>  Want to know the truth about your customers?  Then welcome to <a href="http://sitetarget.ru/">sitetarget.ru</a> .  Be amazed at the data received and please your customers!  We will be grateful for any of your feedback and suggestions on how to make the work of the service better and more useful. <br><br>  <i>And we are looking for a team of interface designer, who are interested in writing - <a href="">team@sitetarget.ru</a></i> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/116611/">https://habr.com/ru/post/116611/</a></p>
