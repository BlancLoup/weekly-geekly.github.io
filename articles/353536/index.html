Many services quickly showed results and captured a significant share of this market through the active use of <a href="https://www.it-grad.ru/services/iaas/iaas-vmware-virtual-infrastructure/">virtual infrastructure</a> .  More about this - under the cut. <br><br> <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/company/it-grad/blog/353536/"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/q8/np/de/q8npdefzppcygrrosbz-cfbh_je.jpeg"></a> <a name="habracut"></a><br>  <font color="#A9A9A9"><i>/ photo <a href="https://flic.kr/p/bqxrwc">Str√≤lic Furl√†n</a> <a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nd/2.0/">CC BY-ND</a></i></font> <br><br><h2>  Promotes the development of car sharing services </h2><br>  There are three main types of car sharing services: car rental (ZipCar, BelkaCar), variations of a private ride (Uber, Yandex.Taxi, Blablacar) and travel without a driver.  All three types combine incredible growth rates of demand.  According to the <a href="https://www.abiresearch.com/press/global-number-of-car-sharing-users-to-reach-650-mi/">forecast of</a> ABI Research, by 2030, 650 million people will use such services.

      The first attempts to create car sharing services were <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carsharing">undertaken</a> in 1948 in Zurich, but due to the lack of scalable control systems and customer access to transport, the project did not take root.  However, the development of IT technologies and GPS navigation has led to the rapid development of the market.  In 2015, 7 million people have already <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/415636/car-sharing-number-of-users-worldwide/">used</a> car-shearing around the world, and according to a Deloitte <a href="https://www2.deloitte.com/content/dam/Deloitte/de/Documents/consumer-industrial-products/CIP-Automotive-Car-Sharing-in-Europe.pdf">study, by</a> 2020 the annual growth rate of this market will be 32%. <br><blockquote>  IaaS play an important role in this development.  Since the very first days of its existence, BelkaCar has <a href="http://iaas-blog.it-grad.ru/kejsy/novyj-operator-karsheringa-belkacar-ispolzuet-oblako-iaas-it-grad-dlya-obespecheniya-otkazoustojchivosti-i-masshtabiruemosti/">used</a> cloud infrastructure due to the possibility of operational scaling.  It was difficult for the service to predict the volume of loads in the new market, and already in the first year of the company's operation it was supposed to increase the number of cars from 100 to 500 </blockquote>  A similar situation <a href="https://cloud.google.com/customers/bulweria/">occurred</a> with Bulweria, the developer of the universal carsharing platform (CUP).  The platform is involved in more than 25 countries.  With the help of virtual infrastructure, the company was able to process data from hundreds of machines and quickly scale the platform over a couple of months. <br><br>  Domenico Mangiacapra, director of business development for Bulweria, said: ‚ÄúThe car sharing market has exploded.  Manage a huge fleet of machines without cloud technology was unreal.  For every thousand dollars spent on the cloud, we would have to spend many times more if we used the old approaches. ‚Äù <br><br>  Another advantage of IaaS is the ability to encapsulate or isolate services within a company.  At the stage of launching BelkaCar, some PHP services were <a href="http://iaas-blog.it-grad.ru/kejsy/novyj-operator-karsheringa-belkacar-ispolzuet-oblako-iaas-it-grad-dlya-obespecheniya-otkazoustojchivosti-i-masshtabiruemosti/">used</a> to solve trivial tasks.  For working with sockets, Python and NodeJS, the main database is PostgreSQL 9.5, and for raw data, MongoDB.  The cloud easily allows you to maintain such a distributed system with the ability to quickly increase the performance of a separate service during the day. <br><br><h2>  Used in security systems </h2><br>  Driving a car <a href="http://faculty.wcas.northwestern.edu/~ipsavage/436.pdf">is still the</a> second most dangerous method of driving after a motorcycle.  In this regard, there are more and more services designed to ensure the safety of driving.  One example of such solutions is the PotHole Alert technology developed by Land Rover.  The technology allows you to scan the road for the presence of holes, potholes, open hatches, as well as to warn drivers about dangerous areas.  Land Rover plans to use cloud technologies in order to transfer information about the imminent danger to other drivers, as well as to create road maps taking into account dangerous areas. <br><br>  Another way to improve security is timely diagnosis.  An example of a service is MECH5.  Using the OEM protocol, the service collects vehicle status data, detects malfunctions, and also generates vehicle health reports in the X-LInk cloud application interface.  IaaS infrastructure allows the service to work in real time, and find the nearest service centers for troubleshooting. <br><br>  Actively uses IaaS technology in their work and the giant industry General Motors (GM).  In 2013, GM <a href="http://media.gm.com/media/us/en/gm/news.detail.html/content/Pages/news/us/en/2013/May/0513-data-center.html">spent $</a> 130 million to create its own cloud center to support the company's operations.  The cloud <a href="https://www.enterprisetech.com/2013/05/17/gm_invests_in_hpc_center_for_crash_test_simulations/">allowed</a> GM to conduct virtual crash test simulations, each time saving $ 350,000 to conduct such tests with real machines. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/vo/rg/or/vorgorstzpbhugf0mybkdzojslu.png"><br>  <font color="#A9A9A9"><i>/ photo <a href="https://flic.kr/p/hQ2Vdu">OurWorld2.0</a> <a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/2.0/">CC BY</a></i></font> <br><br><h2>  Helps to modernize the work of car dealers </h2><br>  Analysts from consulting agency Frost &amp; Sullivan <a href="https://ww2.frost.com/research/industry/automotive-transportation/future-automotive-retail-aftersales/">claim</a> that in the next 10-15 years the auto market will change dramatically.  More than 70% of car sales will be carried out via the Internet, and dealers and manufacturers will invest up to $ 5 billion in computerizing the sales process.  Competition in the market, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automotive_industry">existing</a> since the 1860s, forces them to use any technology that allows them to gain a competitive advantage.  One such technology is IaaS. <br><blockquote>  Since 2011, one of the largest St. Petersburg automobile holdings, Terra-auto, has <a href="http://iaas-blog.it-grad.ru/kejsy/terra-avto-5-let-bezuprechnogo-ispolzovaniya-oblaka-iaas/">transferred</a> its infrastructure to the cloud: critical services, customer service, terminals, databases and servers. <br><br>  The advantage of cloud outsourcing is the ability to scale services at the right time, given the seasonality of the car sales market.  IaaS also allows the company to easily implement projects with an ever-increasing number of participants, for example, <a href="http://www.terravto.ru/new/semejiyj-automobile.html">support programs</a> for novice motorists or large families. </blockquote>  Cloud technologies help to keep the software of produced machines up to date.  For example, Ford <a href="https://www.computerworld.com/article/2898103/cloud-computing/ford-uses-microsoft-cloud-to-seamlessly-update-cars.html">uses</a> cloud services to solve this problem.  The cloud allows you to update the navigation system, communication and entertainment of the car in the background, without the need for owner intervention.  The update applies to released products up to 10 years old, which increases the value of such machines in the secondary market. <br><br><h2>  What's next </h2><br>  Self-driving cars are already becoming part of our lives.  In early 2016, General Motors, in collaboration with Lyft, presented a test project for autonomous machines in Texas, and in the middle of that year, nuTonomy <a href="https://phys.org/news/2016-08-driverless-taxi-firm-eyes-cities.html">launched a</a> similar experiment in Singapore.  Moreover, nuTonomy plans by 2020 to expand its activities to another 9 cities in America, Asia, and Europe. <br><br>  According <a href="https://www.mckinsey.com/industries/automotive-and-assembly/our-insights/ten-ways-autonomous-driving-could-redefine-the-automotive-world">to</a> experts from McKinsey, self-driving cars can save up to 30 thousand lives annually.  Such cars can be used both in the private sector and in the industrial transport sector.  Cloud technologies will allow you to quickly download current routes and traffic information.  The most important breakthrough <a href="https://cloudacademy.com/blog/car-cloud-computing/">will be the</a> ability of cars to interact with each other through the cloud.  This will lead to the formation of a safe transport ecosystem, which will have the possibility of self-regulation, prediction of traffic conditions and traffic jams. <br><br>  Another trend is the development of open source software for cars.  So, General Motors <a href="https://www.developer-tech.com/news/2017/jul/24/general-motors-beats-competitors-vehicle-testing-app-developers/">has released the</a> NGI SDK, which allows third-party developers to run and test their applications for cars.  For such initiatives, IaaS acts as a platform and developer interaction environment with the manufacturer, contributing to an open process of optimizing and improving the security of auto applications. <br><br>  More material in the First Corporate IaaS Blog: <br><br><ul><li>  <a href="http://iaas-blog.it-grad.ru/kejsy/novyj-operator-karsheringa-belkacar-ispolzuet-oblako-iaas-it-grad-dlya-obespecheniya-otkazoustojchivosti-i-masshtabiruemosti/">How carsharing BelkaCar uses the IaaS "IT-GRAD" cloud</a> </li><li>  <a href="http://iaas-blog.it-grad.ru/kejsy/oblachnaya-it-infrastruktura-v-realizacii-mezhdunarodnyx-proektov/">Cloud IT infrastructure in the implementation of international projects</a> </li><li>  <a href="http://iaas-blog.it-grad.ru/tendencii/9-poleznyx-sovetov-dlya-plavnogo-perexoda-v-oblako/">9 useful tips for a smooth transition to the cloud</a> </li></ul></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/353536/">https://habr.com/ru/post/353536/</a></p>
