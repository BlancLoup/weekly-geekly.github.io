      So‚Ä¶ <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  <b><u>Part one.</u></b>  <b><u>Problem.</u></b> <br>  Once upon a time I bought myself a Dell Inspiron 7720-9356 laptop.  I bought it for a number of reasons, one of which is the wide possibilities of an upgrade without digging into the gut of the device.  So the SSD appeared in the laptop, so the memory in it became 16 GB.  But not the point. <br><br>  After some time, Windows 7 offered me to upgrade to Windows 10. And I had the imprudence to agree.  As a result, I received a working system but without hibernation - it safely fell off.  I wrote about this both in the <a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_10-power/hibernation-fails-after-windows-10-upgrade/9cc45668-f36d-48cd-91cf-978cc004e959">Community</a> and in the support chat, but this is not important anymore.  At that time, the SSD was not yet installed, and therefore it is approximately understandable how pleased the laptop was without hibernation. <br><br>  Yes, I rolled back, but Windows 7 gloriously inherited all the problems of Windows 10, in total, a strong decision was made to install the system from scratch.  That's how the SSD appeared with a new breakdown by sections by a full-time installer, a workable Windows 10 that was updated to Anniversary Update at one time, and in general the story could happily end at this point ‚Äî and shouldn‚Äôt write anything, but Alas.  ‚ÄúAlas‚Äù is Creators Update. <br><br>  Currently, Microsoft offers <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/ru-ru/software-download/windows10">two ways to upgrade</a> : a special utility and through the creation of a bootable flash drive.  I tried both. <br><br>  Total: <br><br><ol><li>  When using Windows10Upgrade28085.exe, the system downloads files, checks them, unpacks, and then terminates with error 0xc1900107 </li><li>  When using a flash drive, everything goes well, but then throws out such a message: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/a3a/f1d/6ba/a3af1d6baf564421ad2ba4e8c3e7da07.png"><br></li></ol><br>  IMHO for some reason, the new update considers my SSD flash drive and does not want to work with it.  The fact that with <u>each launch</u> both utilities transfer the <u>entire</u> distribution kit to the C drive (even if I want to, say, create iso, and then create a USB flash drive), it also speaks of the manufacturer‚Äôs concern for users of SSD devices.  Yes, by the way, I have a Samsung 850 pro with Rapid enabled. <br><br>  I created the system images, installed the update as a new installation - everything works, except that I want to save over 9000 settings and installed programs after the update.  Therefore, I rolled back way. <br><br>  Digging into the network and dancing with a tambourine is not helping, and therefore I will be glad to hear any other experience. <br><br>  But at some point I remembered: I have the LICENSE OS!  And I turned in support. <br><br>  <b><u>Part two.</u></b>  <b><u>SUPORD</u></b> <br>  I do not want to be unfounded, just bring our chat with a respected specialist from Support under the cut.  "Dear" he is me, at least for the fact that he is trying very hard to be a good seller.  Which of them is a technical specialist - well, then let everyone decide for himself. <br><br>  If you are a technical specialist who just wants to discuss a problem - do not read this part. <br><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Communication with Support</b> <div class="spoiler_text"> Dmitrii S <br>  Please specify what exactly is the problem in the update? <br>  13:54 <br><br>  I <br>  On my system there are two hard drives: a 256 GB solid-state disk, which has a 100 MB partition created by the system upon installation, the rest of the space is occupied by the system partition C. <br>  The remaining partitions are located on a regular 1 TB hard drive. <br>  When you run the Windows10Upgrade28085.exe utility, it determines that all requirements are met, it downloads files, unpacks them, but then falls out with error 0xc1900107. <br>  When you run an update from a flash drive created using MediaCreationTool.exe, a message is displayed that "You cannot install Windows on a USB flash drive using the installer." <br>  It seems that for some reason the system identifies my SSD disk as a USB flash drive. <br>  Tell me what to do. <br>  13:57 <br><br>  Dmitrii S <br>  I understand you.  I will need information about the configuration of your system for further diagnostics. <br>  Press the key combination Win (checkbox) + i -&gt; System-&gt; About System.  Please rewrite the "Product Code", "Version", "Build OS Or Build OS". <br>  13:57 <br><br>  I <br>  Product Code: (deleted) <br>  Version 1607 <br>  Build OS: 14393.1198 <br>  2:00 pm <br><br>  Dmitrii S <br>  Thank you for the data provided.  Just a moment please. <br>  2:00 pm <br><br>  Dmitrii S <br>  I thank you for the wait.  I see that we are talking about Windows 10 Pro, please specify which device is it?  If it is a laptop or a monoblock, please indicate its brand and model, if it is a stationary PC, please indicate the brand and model of the motherboard <br>  14:02 <br><br>  I <br>  Dell Inspiron 7720 Laptop <br>  14:03 <br><br>  Dmitrii S <br>  Minute, please check compatibility. <br>  14:04 <br><br>  Dmitrii S <br>  The hardware supports the Windows 10 system. Tell me, please, do I understand correctly that you are performing updates by downloading the file and using the ‚Äúupdate this PC now‚Äù option? <br>  2:10 pm <br><br>  I <br>  According to this article here: <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/ru-ru/software-download/windows10">www.microsoft.com/ru-ru/software-download/windows10</a> <br>  There are two ways to upgrade: using the utility Windows10Upgrade28085.exe and using the created media. <br>  I tried both.  Both fail. <br>  14:13 <br><br>  Dmitrii S <br>  That is, do you prepare the media for a clean installation and get the error 0xc1900107?  In both cases, the error is the same? <br>  14:13 <br><br>  I <br>  Not.  Error when using the utility Windows10Upgrade28085.exe <br>  When upgrading from media - the message "Cannot install Windows on a USB flash drive using the installer" <br>  Currently on the C drive is free 176 GB. <br>  14:15 <br><br>  Dmitrii S <br>  I will need you to clarify the following data to continue the diagnosis: <br>  1) Do you have a product key from a Windows system?  Please write it in the chat. <br>  2) Internet connects to PC via - cable directly \ router \ Wi-Fi? <br>  3) Do you use the product at home or in an organization? <br>  4) Do you have an installed proxy server or domain login? <br>  5) Do you have an antivirus?  If so, which one? <br>  6) Do you have crypto-encryption programs? <br>  14:16 <br><br>  Dmitrii S <br>  I would like to tell you briefly about some terms that may not be clear.  Crypto-encryption programs are different, for example, bank clients and other data encryption and decryptors.  A proxy server is usually configured to crawl prohibited sites.  Domain login is usually used in organizations to configure different user profiles in a closed network, it is also possible to configure it at home. <br>  14:16 <br><br>  I <br>  1. There is no key, however there is GenuineTicket.xml. <br>  2. Through WiFi. <br>  3. At home. <br>  4. No. <br>  5. Comodo Internet Security Premium 10 + Windows Defender in disabled real-time protection mode (processed by another program, ie, Comodo). <br>  6. No. <br>  14:18 <br><br>  Dmitrii S <br>  Please specify how the Windows 10 system was purchased by you? <br>  14:19 <br><br>  I <br>  The laptop was installed Windows 7 "out of the box."  When Windows 10 appeared, an update was completed, which was completed successfully, but an error appeared: the computer did not go into hibernation.  As a result, the system was installed cleanly, the above-mentioned GenuineTicket.xml file, obtained when upgrading from Windows 7, was used for activation. <br>  14:21 <br><br>  Dmitrii S <br>  Please write the product key from Windows 7 to the chat. <br>  14:22 <br><br>  I <br>  Unfortunately, it has not been preserved. <br>  14:23 <br><br>  Dmitrii S <br>  The fact is that Entering an activation key is the main activation method, entering an account (activation using a digital license) is an auxiliary activation method and if it does not work, you need to enter the product key, and when you reinstall activation will be necessary, that's why I specify this data. <br>  The digital license is assigned to your device (set of components) and activated using the tools that request activation data on the server, after which activation occurs, if the components change, digital activation may not work and a troubleshooting tool is required.  A digital license does not imply the presence of an additional key, it is like an image of your license located on the server and assigned to your specific device. <br>  There is no other activation in Windows 10 when upgrading from a previous system. <br>  Please specify how this file was received: GenuineTicket.xml? <br>  14:26 <br><br>  I <br>  As I said, after upgrading to Windows 7, there were problems with hibernation.  I wrote about this back in Community: <a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_10-power/hibernation-fails-after-windows-10-upgrade/9cc45668-f36d-48cd-91cf-978cc004e959">answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_10-power/hibernation-fails-after-windows-10-upgrade/9cc66668-f36d-48cd-91cf-978cc004e959</a> <br>  Since they did not offer a solution to the problem, I decided to reinstall the system from scratch in order not to lose activation (and there was no key, as I already said) - I used this advice: <a href="http://winitpro.ru/index.php/2015/08/31/apgrejd-licenzii-do-windows-10-bez-vypolneniya-obnovleniya/">winitpro.ru/index.php/2015/08/31/ apgrejd-licenzii-do-windows-10-bez-vypolneniya-obnovleniya</a> <br>  This is how the GenuineTicket.xml file appeared, which I still keep. <br>  14:30 <br><br>  Dmitrii S <br>  Unfortunately, it seems you are faced with piracy.  The fact is that this service does not belong to Microsoft.  Reinstallation will require a product key.  Can you please tell me if you have any proof of the acquisition of Windows 7? <br>  Evidence of acquisition may be: <br>  ‚Ä¢ Check <br>  ‚Ä¢ Installation disc <br>  ‚Ä¢ Certificate of Authenticity <br>  ‚Ä¢ User's manual <br>  ‚Ä¢ License agreement <br>  14:32 <br><br>  I <br>  Unfortunately not.  The laptop was purchased a long time ago, it is no longer under warranty repair, and therefore all documents are lost. <br>  And how is the system activated now and passes all Microsoft checks? <br>  In addition, I can follow the recommendations from a Microsoft-based resource, namely: <a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_10-windows_install/activation-of-windows-10-and-transfer-of-license/780fab33-f4e5-4d31-b40b-c5e4899b6a8f">answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_10-windows_install/activation-of-windows-10-and-transfer-of-license / 780fab33-f4e5-4d31-b40b-c5e4899b6a8f</a> <br>  At the moment, according to these recommendations, my product is licensed. <br>  14:35 <br><br>  Dmitrii S <br>  Having an activated system and having a license are completely different things.  The license agreement reads as follows. <br>  2 Rights of installation and use. <br>  but.  License.  Software is not sold, but is licensed.  Under this agreement, we grant you the right to install and run one copy of the software on a device (a licensed device) for simultaneous use by one person, if you comply with all the terms of this agreement.  Updating non-genuine software to software from Microsoft or other authorized sources does not make your original version or updated version genuine, in which case you do not have a license to use the software. <br>  14:36 <br><br>  Dmitrii S <br>  In order to resolve the issue within the current system, you will need to purchase a Windows 10 license. The cost of the system currently is: <br>  Windows 10 Home 3699 UAH <br>  Windows 10 Professional 5999 UAH <br>  Are you interested in purchasing a Windows license? <br>  14:37 <br><br>  I <br>  Me, Dmitry, is interested in the update.  You do not find it strange to pay for what I already have, and besides, it does not work in the proper way stated? <br>  I would understand your proposal if the update was successful, and then the system would require me to confirm activation or something else.  But at the moment, instead of supporting, you offer me to buy a cat in a bag. <br>  What does the cat has already been paid for? <br>  14:39 <br><br>  Dmitrii S <br>  In order to get help with using the product, they first need to have it.  At the moment, we have not revealed that you have a license, and for this reason, unfortunately, I cannot now assist you with the installation.  But in case you decide to purchase a license, we will assist you in downloading, installing and activating this product on your device. <br>  14:40 <br><br>  I <br>  Thank you, Dmitri, but so far I have not seen evidence of efficiency, and therefore I see no reason to pay. <br>  Thank you for your participation.  I reserve the right to publish this correspondence in open sources so that existing and future users of Windows 10 can appreciate the level of support for this product. <br>  14:42 </div></div><br><br>  <b>UPD1</b> : <a href="https://linustechtips.com/main/topic/393851-windows-update-recognizes-ssd-as-usb-flash-drive/">Found an extremely similar problem on the network</a> , but no solution was found for it. <br><br>  <b>UPD2</b> : The <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/uk-ua/help/2778881/multiple-operations-fail-if-windows-8-is-improperly-identified-as-a-windows-to-go-installation">problem of recognizing the disk as a flash drive was solved simply</a> .  Of course, to solve this problem, a license key and a lot of additional information were required. <br><br>  However, after rebooting, the system was not installed.  I was tired of wandering around the net looking for solutions, and then rolled up the update from scratch.  The license picked up (this information is for those who continue to believe in the importance of this moment), and now I‚Äôm reinstalling the rest of the software. <br><br>  I wonder very much: if installing and configuring Ubuntu helps searching the Internet and communicating with communities, why is the same recipe true for paid Windows 10?  And if he is faithful, then why pay?  I leave this question rhetorically ... </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/329714/">https://habr.com/ru/post/329714/</a></p>
