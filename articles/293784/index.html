Now, of course, the picture is changing, due to the fact that there are a lot of different business courses that tell what, why and why is needed. <br><br>  At the time when I started my business in 2010, I did not know anything about statistics, about conversion.  I just read in the book what scripts should be.  And only a few years later, I fully understood the importance of scripts when I came up against Internet marketing and drew a clear analogy between land conversion and script conversion. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Statistics is a powerful thing, it‚Äôs just a trump card that covers all guesses and hypotheses.  I was very surprised when I saw visitors coming to my site and turning every day into buyers with the same conversion.  But the page will never show the same conversion, if you constantly change it.  Today, make the blue buttons, tomorrow red, rewrite the title and change the main picture.  The same happens with the script.  The manager cannot show the same conversion if he constantly changes the conversation script.

          data-ad-format="fluid"

      In fact, silence in the tube will also lead to sales with some very, very low conversion.  Having made this analogy, the understanding came to me that every word in the script is important.  And if you dig deeper then not only the word, but also timbre, emotionality, gender and other characteristics of the conversation.  Of course, the conversion from timbre will not dance for dozens or even not a few percent, and it can quite win back hundredths. <br><br><h4>  Algorithm for creating a script </h4><br>  First of all, you need to decide who our target audience is.  Does the decision maker (the decision maker) take the call himself), or the secretary answers the call more often, and he should be ‚Äúbypassed‚Äù before talking to the decision maker. <br><br>  After the picture of your target audience is ‚Äúloaded‚Äù in your head, you can start writing techniques for writing the script.  I will describe what scheme we make the scripts for.  You can use it as a checklist when creating your own script to talk with a client. <br><br><h4>  Clarity </h4><br>  When you call, it is necessary to clarify who you are and for what reason, call the company and what happens in general.  First, you need to say hello, secondly introduce yourself and thirdly explain why you are calling them. <br><br>  <i>The structure of the block of clarity:</i> <br><br>  <b>[Greeting].</b>  <b>[Representation].</b>  <b>[Precedent]</b> <br><br>  <b>Greeting</b> <br><br><ul><li>  Hello; </li><li>  Good day; </li><li>  Good evening; </li><li>  Etc. </li></ul><br><br>  <b>Representation</b> <br><br><ul><li>  My name is Alexey, I represent the company CallbackKILLER; </li><li>  I am from the company CallbackKILLER my name is Alex; </li><li>  My name is Alexey, company CallbackKILLER; </li><li>  Etc. </li></ul><br><br>  <b>Precedent</b> <br><br><ul><li>  You bought a phone from us last year; </li><li>  We noticed a missed call from you yesterday at 20:45; </li><li>  You left a request on the site at 12 o'clock; </li><li>  I am now on your site; </li><li>  Peter Alekseevich Lukoshnik recommended me to call you; </li><li>  At Telecom ++ you came to our booth. </li></ul><br><br><h4>  Contact receipt </h4><br>  The next step is to get the decision makers contacts, if you don‚Äôt already talk to him.  The options for getting contact are many, here are some of them: <br><br>  Tell me please, and who is engaged in advertising online store; <br>  You have a callback button on your site with whom I can talk about the effectiveness of its use; <br>  Who can talk about the purchase of stationery. <br>  Often secretaries "merge on KP".  Send us a commercial offer, we accept all offers by mail.  There is a little trick.  Try to ‚Äúextract‚Äù the name and patronymic of the LPR with such phrases: <br><br>  In whose name to send a commercial offer; <br>  We send letters from the CRM system here you must indicate the name and patronymic of the recipient.  Tell me whose name to enter. <br>  On the next call, you will be able to ask the decision maker by name and patronymic, and the probability of connecting with him in this situation will be higher. <br><br><h4>  Programming </h4><br>  This unit is needed in order to give the interlocutor a picture of how the conversation will be built.  What will be talked about and how long it will take. <br><br>  The basic rules in the preparation of this unit: <br><br><ul><li>  The use of the imperative imperative (Let's do it, I suggest to do the following); </li><li>  Explain what the person will receive in the end; </li><li>  To convey the principle of Yes-Yes, No-No (so that a person would understand that this sale is not treated as the last, and they will not take his wife hostage, that he would buy, but follow the principle should-must-no-no ); </li></ul><br><br>  Example: <br><br>  Ivan Petrovich, let's do this.  I will ask you a few questions to find the best option for you.  You will consider him, and if you like, we will continue to communicate, no - no, I will not insist. <br><br><h4>  Questions </h4><br>  As they say, "The word is silver, and silence is gold."  It is more interesting for all of us to talk about ourselves rather than listen to others.  Therefore, the block of questions is one of the most important.  These questions will help you understand what to offer to the client and what aspects of your offer you need to place accents. <br><br><h5>  Questions - Landmarks </h5><br>  Let us understand the approximate numbers of interest to you.  According to the client‚Äôs budget, by the volume of purchases, by when he wants to complete the project. <br><br><ul><li>  Orient me on your budget; </li><li>  Orient me according to your sugar purchases. </li></ul><br><br><h5>  Question-plug </h5><br>  Question-fork gives several options for answers prepared in advance.  These options can be laid in the CRM system in the form of a drop-down list.  It is convenient to set it if there are certain algorithms for working with the client, after having determined his profile. <br><br><ul><li>  How patient records are kept (On paper, In Excel, In a specialized program); </li><li>  What is the main channel to get customers (Internet, outdoor advertising, advertising in the media). </li></ul><br><br><h5>  Calibration calibration </h5><br>  Ask the client to show what they like, what they don‚Äôt like, to make an offer in the right categories. <br><br><ul><li>  Show examples of interiors that you like and dislike; </li><li>  What colors do you like and what colors do not. </li></ul><br><br><h5>  Question about important </h5><br>  What is important to you? <br><br><h5>  Question unacceptable </h5><br>  What is unacceptable for you <br><br><h5>  Question about special preferences </h5><br>  Do you have any special preferences regarding recreation? <br><br><h5>  Question about making a decision </h5><br>  It makes it clear who will make the decision and what will happen after they make a decision.  How work will be built. <br><br>  Tell me please, will you decide to cooperate?  If we get together how will you continue? <br><br><h5>  Assistant Question </h5><br>  Allows the client to say what is needed for him to make a decision in our direction. <br><br>  What you need to do to our transaction took place. <br><br><h4>  Purpose of the next step </h4><br>  Most importantly, at the end of the conversation, assign the next step.  This can be a call, a meeting, sending a letter and so on.  Under no circumstances should the conversation end with ‚Äúnothing.‚Äù  In fact, the sales department is the structure that allows you to assign and implement the following steps for communication with the client. <br><br>  Always free <a href="https://callbackkiller.ru/%3Futm_source%3Dskripti-prodazh-mmozg">CallbackKILLER</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/293784/">https://habr.com/ru/post/293784/</a></p>
