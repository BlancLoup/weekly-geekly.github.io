  <section class="page js-page"><h1>How is PayPal‚Äôs life after a ‚Äúdivorce‚Äù with eBay</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  On July 17, 2015, <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/PayPal">PayPal</a> completed the separation process from <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/EBay">eBay</a> .  Megamind <a href="https://megamozg.ru/post/17174/">wrote</a> that the cost of PayPal before the branch was $ 44 billion. <br><br>  Thus, PayPal was estimated at 60% of eBay value.  After the separation, eBay shareholders received one PayPal share for each eBay share. <br><br>  The decision to allocate PayPal to a separate company was made in mid-2014.  The company's specialists believe that this division will help increase the income of both companies.

      The shareholder and activist Karl Aykan, one of the ten richest people in the United States, insisted on the allocation of PayPal to an independent company.  Aykan argued that the division would increase the efficiency of the online auction business, increase the total value of the corporation and bring additional profit to eBay shareholders. <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  As a result, eBay entered into an agreement with Aykan to include his business partner, Jonathan Christodoro, on the board of directors.  In addition, it was decided to reduce the level of PayPal corporate protection after the reorganization. <br><br>  Aikan then sold his 46.3 million stake in eBay, which owns the same-name online auction, and announced it had acquired the same number of PayPal shares. <br><br><h4>  Audience expansion, new partners and acquisitions </h4><br>  After the payment service became an independent company, the growth of lending services became more active.  During a report at the Money 20/20 conference, PayPal CEO Dan Shulman announced that, since 2013, the company's credit division has provided small businesses with more than $ 1 billion in loans.  Credits received 60 thousand small enterprises in the USA, Great Britain and Australia. <br><br>  In August 2015, PayPal <a href="https://slon.ru/posts/55316">became the</a> owner of the <a href="http://modest.com/">Modest</a> startup founded in 2012, which helps trading companies create mobile apps for their stores. <br><br>  PayPal has 6.6 million new customers at the end of 2015, compared with an average of 4 million new accounts per quarter in the recent past.  PayPal now has 179 million active users.  It is noted that 1.6 million accounts with PayPal appeared after the purchase of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xoom_Corporation">Xoom</a> service, which allows you to transfer money and pay bills from the USA to 37 countries of the world through a mobile application. <br><br>  In addition, the new <a href="https://www.paypal.com/webapps/mpp/one-touch-checkout/faq">One Touch</a> technology allows PayPal customers to pay for Internet purchases from smartphones with one-touch. <br><br>  From January, residents and guests of London will be able to pay for the Black Cab taxi using payment cards, as well as Apple Pay.  This was made possible by PayPal, which introduces its <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/post/140166">PayPal Here</a> mPOS terminals into a London taxi.  When making a payment, the funds will immediately be credited to PayPal accounts.  At the same time, the company promises users of mobile terminals PayPal Here one of the lowest fees for conducting successful transactions. <br><br><h4>  Charity </h4><br>  PayPal <a href="http://news.finance.ua/ru/news/-/367018/paypal-popal-v-knigu-rekordov-ginnesa">hit</a> the Guinness Book of Records for his contribution to charity.  The book states that PayPal collected online a record amount for charity in 24 hours - 45, 8 million.  The company's previous record was $ 19 million. <br><br>  For the company, 2015 was the most favorable period for projects on charity.  From November 27 to December 31, $ 857 million was transferred to the needs of charitable organizations via the platform. <br><br>  The money was transferred to 7.24 million people from 183 countries.  During this period, PayPal customers often made donations from their smartphones.  A total of 21% or $ 9.1 million of the total donations were transferred from mobile devices. <br><br><h4>  Financial results </h4><br>  In the fourth quarter of 2015, the volume of mobile payments PayPal amounted to $ 20 billion - 45% more than in 2014. <br><br>  Quarterly revenue was $ 2.56 billion, compared with $ 2.19 billion a year earlier, while analysts had forecast $ 2.51 billion. Net income rose from $ 286 million, or 23 cents per share, a year earlier to $ 367 million, or 30 cents per paper and adjusted earnings were 36 cents per share, which exceeded market expectations by 34 cents. <br><br>  The net volume of payments made through PayPal for the reporting period increased by 29%, reaching $ 82 billion. The service revenue in 2015 grew by 15% compared with the previous year and reached $ 9.2 billion. <br><br>  PayPal expects that in the first quarter of 2016, revenue will show an increase of 16-18% and will be about $ 2.4-2.5 billion. <br><br>  After many years of ‚Äúattachment‚Äù to eBay, it proves the company's ability to function successfully as a self-sufficient organization. <br><br>  PayPal's bottom line results were higher than when the company entered eBay.  Shares of the company in the post-market trades in the United States rose 6.4% to $ 33.66, <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2016/01/27/paypal-shares-up-on-earnings-revenue-rises-17/">reports</a> TechCrunch. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/298288/">https://habr.com/ru/post/298288/</a></p>
