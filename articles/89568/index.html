According to the experts to whom we addressed, the main area of ‚Äã‚Äãits application is uranium enrichment. <br><br>  Enriched uranium is a key element of nuclear power, and a Google source told us that this is part of the <a href="http://www.google.com/corporate/green/">Google Green Initiative</a> .  The company intends to use the new technology for the development and possible production of compact, mobile and highly efficient nuclear power plants.  ‚ÄúGoogle has already begun the construction of an enrichment plant,‚Äù says a high-ranking source at the <a href="http://www.un.org/ru/ga/iaea/">IAEA</a> . <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  As <a href="http://green.venturebeat.com/2010/03/31/google-has-a-big-alternative-energy-announcement-forthcoming/">GreenBeat</a> notes, ‚ÄúGoogle finally decided to form a separate division in the company that develops and manufactures its own solar panels, wind turbines, energy-efficient devices, etc. Until now, it has been engaged in‚Äú green ‚Äùtechnologies within individual projects within the company.  Nuclear power is the obvious next step. ‚Äù

      GreenBeat was the first to announce the event (initially heading ‚ÄúGoogle is preparing a big statement on alternative energy‚Äù article) after several <a href="http://twitter.com/dannysullivan/status/11380080397">tweets</a> about the upcoming announcement. <br><br>  However, our other sources claim that Google has no definite plans to pursue nuclear power, despite its long-standing commitment to alternative energy sources. <br><br>  Special attention should be paid to the fact that the acquired company is located outside the United States, and very little is known about the enrichment technology developed by them. <br><br>  Nuclear power is a highly regulated industry.  And the production and distribution of enriched uranium are controlled especially strictly.  The reason for this is the use of enriched uranium for the production of nuclear weapons. <br><br>  According to one of the sources: ‚ÄúGoogle is going to submit information, emphasizing that a new technology is being created for clean energy production.  But all the research and development within the project is concentrated outside the United States, as is the processing plant itself. ‚Äù <br><br>  And more frighteningly: "With this technology, anyone can easily create nuclear weapons." <br><br>  Google, who was suddenly <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2010/01/12/google-china-attacks/">unable to resist Chinese censorship and cyber attacks</a> , could have taken up this research in order to protect itself from external threats. <br><br>  One source notes that if Google were an independent state, it would occupy the 74th line in the list of countries sorted by GDP.  "It is clear that the US government is not going to protect Google from China, so Google makes a logical step towards protecting itself by creating a weapon of deterrence." <br><br>  Of course, most of this is just assumptions.  All that we know for sure: Google has acquired a company that owns a new enrichment technology, and they have begun to study compact mobile nuclear reactors.  But there is also real evidence that Google can work on something more sinister to counter the Chinese threat.  Wait for details. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/89568/">https://habr.com/ru/post/89568/</a></p>
