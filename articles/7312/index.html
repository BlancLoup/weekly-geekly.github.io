This quantity includes: <br>  ‚Ä¢ 55.9 thousand communities <br>  ‚Ä¢ 3.1 thousand accounts RSS feeds <br>  ‚Ä¢ 1.9 thousand OpenID accounts <br>  ‚Ä¢ 200 other types of accounts <br>  ‚Ä¢ 890.1 thousand blogs (individual accounts) <br><br>  Every day, up to 2 thousand new accounts are created in LiveJournal.

      Currently, the basic type of accounts prevails, since historically it is the main type.  The improved account was introduced only in spring 2006 and since then it has been rapidly increasing its share.  Among the new registrations, about 90% fall on improved accounts.  The share of improved accounts since the beginning of 2007 has grown from 29% to 39%. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/olpictures/0c1/00f/9e8/0c100f9e85a3fa6d3fb658042aeb2c4f.jpg" width="450" height="265" hspace="10" vspace="10"><br><br>  <b>Geography</b> <br>  For 497 thousand accounts in the Russian-language LiveJournal, the country of Russia is indicated in the profile.  Another 113 thousand accounts have one of the republics of the former USSR, 3.7 thousand users indicated the USSR. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/olpictures/93f/0c6/6cd/93f0c66cdf6a27bd0a076f12aa786047.jpg" width="450" height="305" hspace="10" vspace="10"><br><br>  The remaining 336 thousand accounts were identified as Russian-speaking by the language in which the information in the profile is given and the posts are published in the journal itself.  The number of these accounts included blogs of representatives of Russian-speaking diasporas in Israel, the USA, Germany, and blogs of authors who did not indicate the country in the profile (as a rule, they are bloggers from Russia), and those blogs whose owners jokingly or negligently indicated the country incorrectly. <br><br>  Among 361 thousand Russian LJ accounts, for which the owners in the profile indicated not only the country, but also the city, 198 thousand accounts fall on Moscow.  In second place is St. Petersburg with 54 thousand blogs.  In total, the two capitals account for 70% of all Russian LJ blogs.  Among other cities, the number of users of LiveJournal leaders are Novosibirsk (8.4 thousand) and Ekaterinburg (6 thousand).  Another 14 cities have from 2 to 4 thousand users, in 28 cities - from 500 to 2 thousand <br><br>  <b>Age and gender</b> <br>  The bulk of LJ users are concentrated in the age range from 18 to 25 years.  Those born in 1981-1988 account for 57% of all accounts (including 22% for 18-20 year olds and 35% for 21-25 year olds).  If you also include an older group of 26-30 years, then the total for three categories will be more than 3/4 of all journals in LiveJournal (76%). <br><br>  Under 18 years old, 9% of LJ users, 15% of bloggers over 30 years old, including 7% over 35 years old and 1% over 50 years old. <br><br>  Among LJ users who indicated their gender (71%), 47% are women and 53% are men.  Men dominate among users of LJ over 25 years of age, while the majority of teenagers among LJ bloggers are girls. <br><br>  By occupation, almost every fifth LJ visitor is a manager. <br><br>  <b>Activity</b> <br>  For the month, the number of authorized users visiting LJ reaches 510 thousand. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/olpictures/7e5/c2b/6bc/7e5c2b6bc2193b5db686fae220783c4f.jpg" width="382" height="314" hspace="10" vspace="10"><br><br>  At least once a week, LiveJournal is visited by 310 thousand users - almost a third of the total number of accounts.  At the same time, a comparison of data on the number of authorized users (logins) per day and per week shows high activity of LJ users - on average, one authorized user is logged in LJ 4 days per week. <br><br>  Among almost 950 thousand Russian-language blogs, at least one record (for the entire time of its existence) contains 680 thousand blogs (72%).  Among the 270 thousand "empty" blogs there are also actually used - but only for reading through the formation of a tape of friends. <br><br>  On average, one blog contains about 70 entries. <br><br>  If we start from the frequency of blog updates, then 130,000 people can be classified as active LJ authors - just as many blogs are updated at least once a week.  For a month, 220 thousand blogs are updated, for a quarter - 300 thousand. <br><br>  As of mid-April 2007, there were 67 million posts in LJ.  Every week this number increases by more than 600 thousand - every weekday LJ users leave about 100 thousand new messages in LJ (and only on weekends this number is reduced to about 70 thousand). <br><br>  Of the total number of posts added daily, 74% are blog posts, 9% are posts in communities, and 17% are automatic RSS broadcasts from external sources. <br><br>  The content of LiveJournal is not limited to posts - about 2.7 million new comments appear on blogs and communities every week in LiveJournal (380 thousand per day).  On average, one post has 4.5 comments. <br><br>  <b>Attendance</b> <br>  Russian audience LJ - the most active.  On average, there are 62 hits per week per visitor from Russia, while 28 hits per visitor from other countries. <br><br>  The average daily attendance of LJ is 595 thousand people (according to server statistics SixApart).  On weekdays, the daily audience of LJ averages <br>  650 thousand people, 460 thousand people a day come to LJ.  The average daily Russian LJ audience is 360 thousand people. <br><br>  The weekly audience of the Russian-speaking LJ is 2.2 million people, incl.  more than 1.2 million visitors from Russia.  The monthly audience (according to March data) amounted to 6 million people, of which 3.3 million are actually the Russian audience. <br><br>  <b>Positions in RuNet</b> <br>  LJ ranks fourth in the rating of Top@Mail.Ru by the size of the average daily audience after Mail.Ru, Rambler and RBC (week 9‚Äì15 April). <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/olpictures/7e1/336/e0d/7e1336e0dcbf77d6fdd8f2b65d0d138d.jpg" width="368" height="360" hspace="10" vspace="10"><br><br>  According to the TNS Web Index, LJ by the size of the monthly and weekly audience in Moscow (among users 12-54 years old) ranks third after Yandex and Mail.Ru with a one and a half fold advantage over its closest competitor KP.ru. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/olpictures/d5f/629/25c/d5f62925cbdcf83a1a3c8b276ec423d2.jpg" width="450" height="424" hspace="10" vspace="10"><br><br>  <b>Traffic</b> <br>  Every week on the pages of LiveJournal more than 60 million hits are made.  On weekdays, attendance reaches 10 million hits, at the weekend traffic is 30% less - about 7 million. <br>  Of the total traffic, 18% of hits accounted for the service pages (including the start page <a href="http://www.livejournal.com/">www.livejournal.com</a> and the user profile pages).  82% of traffic is provided by blog and community pages (the first pages of blogs, friends feeds, pages of individual posts), including  23% of traffic comes from communities. <br><br>  Logged-in users, who make up only 30% of the average daily audience of LJ, provide 70% of the traffic. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/7312/">https://habr.com/ru/post/7312/</a></p>
