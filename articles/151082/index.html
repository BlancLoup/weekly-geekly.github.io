By the way, this autumn gadget harvest will not end, but the main players will report and it will be possible to imagine what technologies we will live next year. <br><br>  But what started in social networks and techno-blogs after the presentation of the Lumia 920 and Lumia 820 made me break my vow.  I really did not understand something!  Too obviously, deliberately and with passion, everyone started attacking Nokia, once again burying the lion, striving to climb the pedestal, from which he had already descended a long time ago.  And this is despite the fact that the products presented by the Finnish giant, at least one of them, the flagship, Lumia 920, is very, very good.  In any case, as far as it is possible to judge the device at all by descriptions and characteristics, and not live testing it. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a>

      Let's imagine that on September 12 Apple presents iPhone5 with: <br>  1) wireless charging, and will outline their plans for equipping urban public institutions with similar charges <br>  2) LTE support (which will generally be taken for granted and will not be mentioned at the presentation at all) <br>  3) innovative technology of photo, video and sound recordings, which (without exaggeration !!!) turn reality into a movie (in fact, this is not one point, but three, and each of them can be painted on the page; nevertheless, let's put them in one, for clarity and in order to avoid reproaches of exaggeration) <br>  4) HD + capacitive display, which for the first time will support the work not only by touching the fingers or the tip of the nose, but also with objects, or fingers with gloves, for example. <br>  5) Imagine that this is not Nokia, but Apple, in addition to the best mapping and navigation services on the market (which will now work offline, while Apple, you know what happens in this segment) will launch another map service - with the function augmented reality, which, when you hover the camera smartphone on the terrain, will give information about institutions, organizations, etc. around. <br><br>  Have you imagined that all these characteristics are not Nokia Lumia 920, but iPhone5?  And now fantasize what would begin around this device in social networks!  Every first person would have written about the coming future, and every second would have said that the spirit of Steve Jobs, who dictated all this, descended on Tim Cook.  Although, personally, in this case, I would have written something completely different: I would have written that Steve Jobs did not even die at all, but simply went into retirement, retired from what they said, and his death was the first precedent of the so-called digital death. when a public figure dies, and if the person himself physically dies, God knows him.  In general, I would have written, Jobs is alive and living in the Crimea, or in Tibet, or in the Himalayas. <br><br>  But Apple will also demonstrate that Jobs‚Äôs spirit has been dictated to Tim Cook.  And if it suddenly turns out that the spirit of Jobs only ordered to pull out a little iPhone, it would be embarrassing, for which, nevertheless, Apple only scolded a little, they say, you should be more creative anyway.  But Nokia for real breakthrough technologies has undergone such a massive attack that it was even unclear why and for what? <br><br>  Formally, because the commercial, which, by the way, came out before the premiere of the device, was filmed not on the Lumia 920, but on a professional camera.  Okay, let's break this incident. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/moJ9T5pgKkA&amp;xid=17259,15700021,15700186,15700190,15700253,15700255,15700259&amp;usg=ALkJrhjteg6qP8md9N9kUBOAVqEQrmXg1g" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  If at the time of shooting this video Lumia 920 was not yet ready, you could remove it on the Nokia 808 PureView.  As a person who has very thoroughly tested this device, I can assure you that it would turn out just as good.  Here is an example of a short movie with a girl, but without a great one.  I admit: I slightly corrected the colors in Canopus Edius.  (it is desirable to watch in Full HD resolution) <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/u1vuvqC3WDc%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700021,15700186,15700190,15700253,15700255,15700259&amp;usg=ALkJrhhM7El8es-DT09_uswBN0oVTYVWsA" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  Someone will say that the Nokia 808 PureView has 41 megapixels, and the Lumia 920 is only 8.7 megapixels, so on Lumia 920 this video cannot be removed.  Not true!  41 MP in the Nokia 808 Pureview in the video only affect the ability to zoom.  That is, thanks to 41 megapixel 3-fold digital zoom in the Nokia 808 PureView works the same as the optical one - without loss of quality.  But the video is still shot at 8 megapixel.  You can see this in this example, which is also recommended for viewing in Full HD resolution: <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/Y1QM262girY%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700021,15700186,15700190,15700253,15700255,15700259&amp;usg=ALkJrhjR6v-XSOqVcG13M8rPk3wm6QNzlA" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  So, in theory, the Lumia 920 should shoot a video just as good as the Nokia 808 PureView, just zooming the picture on it will not work as well.  But in the video with a girl on a bike, there is no zooming, so removing such a video on a Lumia 920 would not be a problem. <br><br>  And here, in fact, the question arises: why or why, in this case, this video was filmed not on PureView, but on a professional camera, and even so that this camera was reflected in the window opposite the van.  Blurt ?!  Everyone only does what they point a finger, cackle and shout: ha ha ha!  L√§√§√§√§√§ !!!  But personally, I somehow do not really believe in blunders of professionals who receive hundreds of thousands of euros for their work.  I'm not talking about the fact that you can pay for such a blooper and head.  And any person who has ever been in the editing program knows that there is no chance to miss such a blunder when looking through the material through frames.  He would have been noticed, 100% percent noticed!  Can you imagine what diagonal monitors stand for with editors at Nokia?  Anything more than monitors in the wording of The Verge, whose journalists seem to have discovered this blunder. <br><br>  Rather, another effect is used here, which in the jargon of the writers is called ‚Äúgag from scratch‚Äù, or ‚Äúvisual gag‚Äù.  In film films, this technique was used by many, both great and unknown directors.  For example, in Pasolini, in the film Decameron, which appears to be acting like the 16th century (or in the 15th?), The bra on the back of the exposed heroine suddenly shows up.  Or another, common example, when a microphone unexpectedly fits into the frame space.  Do you think Pasolini did not see a bra trace?  Or other directors did not notice the microphone that fit into the frame?  Of course not.  This is an absolutely conscious device aimed at attracting the attention of the viewer, a micro-scandal, counterpoint, disturbing calm perception and focusing the viewer on the material with a new force.  Hollywood psychologists explain this to writers like this: having seen a blunder, a discrepancy, a counterpoint, the viewer begins to feel smarter and better director, his self-esteem rises, and with it his attention rises. <br><br>  This is if in the cinema to explain.  And it can be explained in a media, in a journalistic manner.  And then it will turn out that: the reflection of the operator with a professional camera in the window of the van opposite appeared specially.  In order for the scandal to break out, which attracted to PureView the attention of probably more people than it would attract the attention of the video, albeit very high-quality (essentially exactly the same), but shot on the Lumia 920 or on the Nokia 808 PureView.  That is, in essence, I argue that shooting this video to a professional camera and reflecting the operator with it in the window of the van opposite, is the work of Nokiev's PR people and scriptwriters.  And the journalists of The Verge, I think (although I have no evidence), learned about this not without a hint from Nokia itself. <br><br>  As a screenwriter by training and a journalist with more than 20 years of experience, I barely know the kitchen of creating information leads.  Therefore, for me personally, this whole scandal is only the professional work of a shadow PR team in spike with journalists.  Incidentally, when such scandals, plums are planned, you can foresee and jumps in stock prices on the stock exchange and very good money for them. <br><br>  As for the two smartphones that Nokia introduced, the flagship, the Lumia 920, looks very cool, almost revolutionary, and I personally have no questions for Nokia itself.  Well done!  Nokia has once again shown who is actually the coolest!  Another thing is that the questions remained to Microsoft.  What is WP8?  First of all: what about multitasking?  - Because if WP8 is a conceptual clone of iOS, like WP7 was, then, I'm afraid Nokia‚Äôs revolutionary technologies may not be enough for the success of devices on this operating system.  Android users, despite the temptation PureView, wireless charging, three microphones, without any problems writing sound in 5 + 1 stereo at a pressure of 140 decibels, a live display, before touching which in winter you will not need to remove gloves and other other innovations - so Here, Android users of all this may not be enough, if it turns out that WP8 is a closed operating system with limited multitasking.  And what is the WP8, in fact, we learn only at the end of October, when the working devices Lumia 920 and Lumia 820 will appear on store shelves. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/151082/">https://habr.com/ru/post/151082/</a></p>
