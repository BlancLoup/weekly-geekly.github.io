We carefully analyzed your criticism of the site and suggestions and much has been redone, redone.  Details under the cut: <br><br> <a href="http://www.fidel.ru/"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/ba141585/a5c5dfd3/6b23f802/d853cb68.png"></a> <br> <a href="http://www.fidel.ru/"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/8617f03d/b397870a/f66ee64e/8b6f7baa.png"></a> <br><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  - Introduced the top bar with a common player.  Now a fixed top bar with a single player for albums and playlists. <br>  - Introduced global album and track functionality <br>  When you hover over an album or track, a special button appears that opens a menu with all the available actions for an album or track: share with friends, add a playlist, or buy an album / track. <br>  - The current listening queue has appeared <br>  When you start listening to an album or playlist, the track list will be added to the queue, which makes it easy to control playback even when you continue surfing the site and leave from the album page or playlist.  The same queue stores the history of auditions for the current session. <br>  - Sharing appeared, not only playlists, but also albums and tracks, and not only on Facebook, but also on Twitter, LiveJournal, and also through the embed-code for the blog.  You can listen to the shared album or track without registering on the site. <br>  - Altered the logic of buying content, it became easier and faster.  For users who have tied their bank card to the service, a one-click purchase is available. <br>  - Written new video player with progressive download. <br>  - Made a new design for the album page and playlist <br>  - Redone search results page.  Now you can see all the content that is in our catalog on one page. <br>  - Made saving the listening state.  If you listened to something and closed the tab with the site, then when you return to the site you will automatically continue to listen to music from the moment of disconnection.

      <b>And we are starting to test a new service for users, - uploading your own music files to Fidel servers.</b> <br><br>  Especially for you, we present an open API for uploading your own multimedia files to Fidel. <br><br>  The API can be downloaded from the link from our developer forum after quick registration.  <a href="http://devforum.fidel.ru/default.aspx%3Fg%3Dposts%26m%3D1">devforum.fidel.ru/default.aspx?g=posts&amp;m=1#post1</a> <br><br>  API features and available actions for downloaded files. <br><br>  You can download music files of any format.  After uploading to our servers, the downloaded tracks will be available for listening in a special playlist of the user called ‚ÄúDownloads‚Äù (for streaming purposes, all tracks are converted by us to mp3 with a different bitrate). <br>  If in the future you want to take your files back to the original format, then when loading you need to use the API function to store the original file on the server. <br><br>  You can upload only one file in one package, but the number of packages sent for users is unlimited. <br><br>  For downloadable files, there is one small restriction on use on the Fidel service: <br><br>  - If we do not have rights to the downloadable track (or we did not recognize it as a track to which we have rights), then it will be available only for your personal listening.  You can add it to various playlists, etc., but you will not be able to share it with your friends on Facebook, Twitter or a blog. <habracut><br><br>  We have no restrictions on the number of downloaded files or on the download speed.  So use, try and comment. <br><br>  <b>Over the past six months, we have a lot of new independent labels.</b>  <b>So sophisticated users can become even more sophisticated =)</b> <br><br>  Dig Dis is a company that represents 700 independent labels specializing in a wide variety of electronics genres, from lounge to industrial, but publishing a constantly interesting and high-quality music product.  Among the labels that are worth noting Caballero Recordings, ChinChin Records, Jubilee Records, BLACK RAIN. <br><br>  Ingrooves is the largest American distributor of indie music with a catalog of more than 250,000 tracks, including products from such well-known labels as ESL Music, Metal Blade Records, VP Records, Shanachie Records, Fat Possum Records. <br><br>  PIAS is one of the oldest integrators of the European independent scene, only one fact speaks about the level, the group Placebo, which recently left the legendary label Mute and the major EMI, released its last album ‚ÄúBattle For The Sun‚Äù on PIAS.  The company also publishes albums Ti√´sto, The Human League, Mr. Oizo, Grace Jones. <br><br>  In the near future, Fidel users will have a unique opportunity to get acquainted with the Beggars group catalog representing the largest independent labels 4AD, Rough Trade Records, Matador Records and XL Recordings in their catalog today, whose artists occupy the first lines of world charts, among such stars Adele and the legendary Radiohead . <br><br>  We hope that these changes and innovations will make working with the <a href="http://www.fidel.ru/">site</a> convenient and enjoyable.  We look forward to comments and criticism.  Your advice helps us to do service better. </habracut></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/129258/">https://habr.com/ru/post/129258/</a></p>
