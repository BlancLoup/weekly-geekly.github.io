After all, they are so different! <br><br>  And every time we find new solutions for this problem.  For example, this year the technical track will be presented in four specialized sections: FrontTalks, DevOps, Mobile and ServerSide.  Each of them will be rich and interesting, you can see for yourself (overview of <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/company/it_people/blog/280742/">Mobile</a> and <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/company/it_people/blog/280508/">DevOps sections</a> on Habr√©, <a href="http://dump-conf.ru/section/8/">FrontTalks</a> program). <br><br>  Of all the variety of interesting themes for backend developers, it was necessary to choose only 9 of the best.  How we solved this problem and what happened in the end, read under the cut. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  We introduced two criteria for selection: <br>  1. The topic should be interesting to someone from the program committee. <br>  Since our areas of interest vary greatly, the section turned out rather mixed and covers several areas of interest.

In our conference represents the interests of web developers from studios. <br>  ‚Ä¢ Daniel Skrobov leads development at Vostok projects.  Represents the interests of small start-up teams, developers of their own projects and those who are constantly looking for new solutions. <br>  ‚Ä¢ Andrei Fefelov leads web development in Ruby and Python in Mastery.pro. <br>  ‚Ä¢ Konstantin Beklemishev leads the development department of Naumen Contact Center, whose telephone platform is written in C ++ and Python, and the business system is written in Java. <br>  ‚Ä¢ Alexander Kokovin - developer from SKB Kontur. <br>  Kostya and Sasha represent the interests of enterprise developers in java and .Net. <br><br>  Thank them for their work! <br><br>  2. Often, viewing IT conference programs causes a feeling of deja vu. <br>  Therefore, we decided to give priority to new trends - the fact that it is only gaining momentum and is seen as promising and applicable in some approximation now.  Naturally, in this case we are focusing not just on the educational program in the reports, but on real experience, on our own tangible results, which speakers should share. <br><br>  Now more about each report. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/451/9fc/146/4519fc146b9fbcf9cc280d283f81d610.jpg" width="100" height="100" title="petunin.jpg" alt="petunin.jpg" align="left">  Representatives of the Java-world are eagerly awaiting the appearance of Java 9. Anticipating this event, the head of the prototyping department <b>Sergey Petunin</b> from <b>the IT Center</b> will share the results of the preparation of the new ‚Äúsmart‚Äù compiler sjavac.  You will learn what it is worth waiting for from him and in what cases it should be used without fail. <br><br>  The topic of choosing a database architecture, increasing its speed and performance is relevant for most projects.  Therefore, several slots are devoted to databases at once. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/497/743/b5b/497743b5bbc2d0d60c77fa010e5545ad.jpg" width="100" height="100" title="bartunov.jpg" alt="bartunov.jpg" align="left">  <b>Oleg Bartunov</b> , the leading Russian developer of PostgreSQL with 20 years of experience, the general director of <b>Postgres Professional</b> , the Russian vendor of this DBMS, will talk about the direction in which PostgreSQL is developing and how important for all serious products will be solved: resiliency and scalability . <br><br>  In addition, during the conference, Oleg will hold a separate meeting with fans of PostgreSQL, where he will tell about the place of PostgreSQL in the modern IT landscape in the world and our country, about the prospects of PostgreSQL and the domestic industry of system software development.  At the meeting, you can share your opinion about PostgreSQL and ask any questions. <br><br>  All are welcome.  If you are not participating in the conference, but want to attend the meeting, <a href="http://bit.ly/1ME78rR">register</a> .  Participation in the meeting is free. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/5c0/f22/42f/5c0f2242f62258656c5ac3af84bec785.jpg" width="99" height="100" title="arkaev.jpg" alt="arkaev.jpg" align="left">  <b>Andrei Arkaev</b> from <b>Naumen</b> will share practical cases on how to use the jsonb in PostgreSQL and xmltype in Oracle to speed up the database: how to solve the problem of storing attributes with jsonb in PostgreSQL and xmltype in Oracle;  what profit in terms of size, indexes and speed of the queries can be obtained;  what search tools for this type of data are in the database, indexing;  limitations of this approach. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/ea0/629/bfc/ea0629bfc94bb0111990e60fb1cd9542.jpg" width="100" height="100" title="grishenko.jpg" alt="grishenko.jpg" align="left">  But no matter how cool the database on your servers, in the world of mobile devices and the unstable Internet, you cannot access it for every user action.  <b>Victor Grishchenko</b> , an independent consultant, the author of <b>Swarm.js</b> , will tell you how to exist in such conditions - a database on a partially ordered log and CRDT types that provides caching, synchronization and work offline, on the client and the server. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/505/7f3/06c/5057f306cf7d4a36a328f0c1903bc62f.jpg" width="100" height="100" title="denisov.jpg" alt="denisov.jpg" align="left">  Those who, in their aspirations to enslave the world, have already come out or are about to go beyond the borders of their native country, the report of <b>Alexander Denisov</b> from <b>Naumen</b> will be interesting.  He will talk about how to properly prepare for software localization, to subsequently avoid a big headache, where the rakes lie, how to adjust the development, testing and documentation processes to achieve optimal localization quality, which you should think about in advance, and what tools already exist which greatly facilitate the translation process. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/510/c68/254/510c68254def91be477208729d943403.jpg" width="100" height="100" title="chevdar.jpg" alt="chevdar.jpg" align="left">  There will be several tasty reports for true connoisseurs of high matters. <br><br>  <b>Igor Chevdar</b> from <b>SKB Kontur</b> will talk about the approaches that allowed him to speed up the work of standard libraries by an order of magnitude, as well as how code generation will help save you from nauseous attacks at the sight of an optimal code. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/c43/b74/e86/c43b74e8697d8e632c90db489f14100a.jpg" width="92" height="100" title="talipov.jpg" alt="talipov.jpg" align="left">  And <b>Ruslan Talipov</b> , a developer at <b>findmeals.com</b> , will help try on DeepLearning.  You will learn how, why, and with what tools to use neural networks in your projects, even if you are not a Yandex.Music developer.  Of course, every cook will not understand this, but many of the fears of this fashionable thing will disappear. <br><br>  Well, for those who know how to count money and time and wants to get the most out of it with minimum investment through the use of the right tools, there will be two more reports. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/960/7ea/4ed/9607ea4ed43c886408ec8c8c5f150ec9.jpg" width="100" height="100" title="bunin.jpg" alt="bunin.jpg" align="left">  Katerina‚Äôs words from the film ‚ÄúMoscow Doesn‚Äôt Believe in Tears‚Äù - ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs hard to have three, and when you learn to organize three, then the number doesn‚Äôt matter,‚Äù <b>Oleg</b> <b>Oninko,</b> director-general of high- <b>powered</b> Internet projects development studio, will illustrate with server management.

It can be used in the cloud and on your hardware, you can use CI for private projects and many other cool things that greatly accelerate and cheapen the development of projects. <br><br>  And on April 9, Ivan will hold Lean Poker.  The task is to write a bot for playing poker.  Participants choose a programming language, break into teams, and ... bots start playing poker (for connoisseurs, Texas Hold'em).  At the exit we get a concentrated decision making experience.  All the details and registration <a href="http://dump-conf.ru/section/26/">here</a> . <br><br>  Of course, it is difficult to choose topics that are obviously interesting to absolutely any programmer, but we are sure that every developer in any language and with any experience will be able to benefit.  It is impossible to teach a new technology in 30-40 minutes of a report, but yes, to arouse curiosity, to generate interest, to give a ‚Äúkick‚Äù for your own experiments.  And we hope that our reports will fulfill these tasks. <br><br>  Program and registration - on <a href="http://dump-conf.ru/talks/%3Futm_source%3Dnews%26utm_medium%3Dpost%26utm_term%3Dhabr06%26utm_content%3Dhabr06%26utm_campaign%3Dhabr06">the conference website</a> . <br><br>  See you in Ekaterinburg on April 8! <br><br>  Thanks to our sponsors that make the conference possible: <a href="https://kontur.ru/">SKB Kontur</a> , <a href="http://www.naumen.ru/">Naumen</a> , <a href="http://www.centre-it.com/">IT Center</a> . </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/281032/">https://habr.com/ru/post/281032/</a></p>
