People and developers rate it differently.  Someone believes in her success, and someone talks about her failure.  When a user first meets, the user has two questions: a) where all my applications that I used on other platforms b) why all those applications that are are so bad. <br><br>  In order to answer these questions, let's look at the statistics of the application, which I published in the Windows Store over a year ago. <br><br>  <a href="http://apps.microsoft.com/windows/en-us/app/outcoldplayer/939f0859-1413-4a52-9ab6-6e50405c8c2e">outcoldplayer</a> (previous name gMusicW) is my home project, which I write in my spare time.  This is an unofficial client for Google Music.  I can call it a fairly successful project in the Windows Store.  At least because at one time he was in first place in the list of best-selling applications (now somewhere in the 29th place in the USA).

Is it in Windows 8?  My short answer: I'm not a millionaire yet.  Over the past year, I earned less on the application than my monthly salary, which I get in my main job. <br><br><h4>  A little outcoldplayer story </h4><br>  I published the first version of the application somewhere in January-February 2013.  Yesterday I published the 40th update.  Initially, I distributed the application as free, but with advertising.  Users had the opportunity to remove ads using a special package Ad-free <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/c9c/d8a/d2e/c9cd8ad2eff714797ec9f26158c1bf33.png"><br><br>  2 months ago I began to distribute the application as paid.  For several reasons: <br><br><ol><li>  It is difficult to maintain the design when you constantly have to insert advertising. </li><li>  I didn‚Äôt like the quality of the Microsoft Ad Plaform library.  The library left a huge number of unhandled exceptions in the <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.threading.tasks.taskscheduler.unobservedtaskexception.aspx">TaskScheduler.UnobservedTaskException</a> , which made me worry about the quality of the library. </li><li>  Earnings from advertising was very unstable.  In one month you get $ 50, in another $ 500.  Filling in advertising is very small 32%. </li></ol><br><br>  So in the last two months - the application has become paid and costs $ 5.99. <br><br><h4>  Windows versions </h4><br>  I still support Windows 8, but it seems that the majority of users of the application have migrated to Windows 8.1 <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/1f8/f07/f5b/1f8f07f5b9982b6379690e1722d6cf16.png"><br><br>  This list also includes Microsoft employees who are testing the application while publishing.  So, we can say that the number of Windows 8 users is almost equal to 0%.  This number is different from <a href="http://www.netmarketshare.com/operating-system-market-share.aspx%3Fqprid%3D10%26qpcustomd%3D0">web statistics</a> , where Windows 8 has more percent than Windows 8.1. <br><br><h4>  Ratings </h4><br>  On average, users of the application are happy <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/856/fbb/a2a/856fbba2a70d8b045e710bcf9a670602.png"><br><br>  But of course I exist and unhappy, for example, the main claims <br><br><ul><li>  Some users do not understand why they should pay for the application.  After all, they have already paid for Windows 8, they also pay for the Google Music service.  And I can understand them.  Not everyone knows and understands the word "unofficial". </li><li>  Some users have driver problems.  Yes, applications from Windows Store also depend on drivers.  Several discussions on the Microsoft <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_8-winapps/windows-8-apps-netflix-hulu-youtube-tunein-will/cfd05107-daed-4f7e-a4d2-985b0b21871c%3Fpage%3D1%26tm%3D1400460139386">Windows 8 Apps</a> forums <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_8-winapps/windows-8-apps-netflix-hulu-youtube-tunein-will/cfd05107-daed-4f7e-a4d2-985b0b21871c%3Fpage%3D1%26tm%3D1400460139386">(Netflix, Hulu, Youtube, TuneIn) will not stream</a> , <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows8_1-windows_install/0xc00d11d1-0x8007007e-windows-81-update/0b4e731c-e2f9-45f7-bbf1-611cb10dc449">0xc00d11d1 (0x8007007e) windows 8.1 update</a> . </li></ul><br><br><h4>  Downloads </h4><br>  Below are statistics on downloads for the last year.  When the application was free he had 200-500 downloads per day.  The paid version has 10-40 downloads per day (this change is noticeable in April) <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/904/5a8/373/9045a8373a422d64cd88269812b3c137.png"><br><br>  As you can see, most of the downloads are from the USA (my application supports only one language ‚Äúen‚Äù). <br><br><h4>  Screen resolution </h4><br>  Unfortunately, there are no statistics on how many of them support touch. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/e4b/4ac/f83/e4b4acf83ead150bf96057d68aaf6e28.png"><br><br><h4>  Application update process </h4><br>  This was a huge problem in Windows 8, that users simply did not know how to update applications from the Windows Store, and they simply did not.  Constantly received bad reviews or emails with old mistakes or incompatibility with the latest changes in Google Music.  At the moment, as you can see, there is no such problem (the latest version has been updated 90% in a week) <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/0b0/0b4/a90/0b00b4a90234c64101ab26a8f7c69150.png"><br><br><h4>  Results </h4><br>  I want to sum up a little about this.  Statistics are not happy, of course.  The main problems that I see in the platform: users do not want to use the Windows Store applications (and as a result, they probably don‚Äôt buy Windows tablets), since there are not that many good applications there.  On the other hand, developers do not want to spend their time developing applications on the Windows Store platform, since there are not so many users willing to pay.  Well, seriously, I was higher than Grand Theft Auto in the list of best paid apps with about 35 sales per day.  You know the price of GTA in the Windows Store, try multiplying. <br><br>  Does this mean that we have to forget about Windows 8 and come to terms with the iPad and Android tablets?  For us, as users, it‚Äôs certainly nice to have 3 different platforms than 2 (let there be more competition).  So my answer is no.  Hope that the next <a href="http://www.theverge.com/2014/4/23/5643328/windows-8-start-menu-return-in-second-update">update</a> on Windows 8 will be more lucky.  I'm not talking about the Start menu, but about the fact that the Windows Store applications will be possible to run on the desktop in windows of different sizes.  It seems to me - this should give another leap for Windows Store applications.  Time will tell. <br><br>  If you want to try the application, here is the link <a href="http://apps.microsoft.com/windows/en-us/app/outcoldplayer/939f0859-1413-4a52-9ab6-6e50405c8c2e">outcoldplayer</a> .  It is paid.  If you don‚Äôt like it, you can somehow get a refund from Microsoft (you don‚Äôt ask me, I don‚Äôt have access to payments). <br><br>  <i>PS</i> <br><br><ul><li>  <i>I am the author of the article I translated.</i>  <i>Rarely have to write something in Russian, so the number of errors may be unexpectedly large.</i>  <i>If you see any errors, I will correct them with pleasure, the main thing is to let know about it (preferably in a personal mail).</i> </li><li>  <i>(b) Published in I am PR, because I provide a link to <a href="http://apps.microsoft.com/windows/en-us/app/outcoldplayer/939f0859-1413-4a52-9ab6-6e50405c8c2e">the application itself</a> .</i>  <i>I do not want it to look like a hidden PR.</i>  <i>So let's call it PR.</i> </li></ul></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/223975/">https://habr.com/ru/post/223975/</a></p>
