  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Yet another registry. What in practice means getting into the register of information dissemination organizers</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  On September 12, Yandex was added to the <a href="http://97-fz.rkn.gov.ru/organizer-dissemination/viewregistry/">register of information dissemination organizers</a> - like some other Internet companies, such as VKontakte and Mail.ru.  Judging by the questions that we get from all sides, this event worries many, but everyone is rather ill at ease with what is happening.  Let's try to explain how it looks now from our point of view.  Looking ahead, we say that getting into this registry by itself does not change anything. <br><br>  On August 1, amendments to the law on information entered into force.  These amendments received the unofficial name of the "law on bloggers" - this is the name that still confuses many. <br><br>  The point is that the amendments consist of two different blocks.  The first unit introduces such a concept as ‚Äúinformation dissemination organizer‚Äù - this is the one who provides the systems that allow users to exchange messages.  According to the adopted amendments, the organizers are obliged to store for six months, in Russia, all information received about the users of their services and the actions taken by them.  We are talking only about the fact of committing a particular action - in other words, the organizers should keep, for example, all information about sending a particular letter or downloading a particular file, but not the content of this letter or file.

      It is important to note that the law does not oblige Internet companies to collect more information than they have already used to ensure the normal operation of their services.  They are obliged to store only what is already there, and not to develop any special functionality for collecting and storing new data. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  For example, if the service does not provide for the registration and authorization of users, it is not required to enter it.  Or if the service does not have data about the user's browser, it does not need to start collecting this information.  You can view a complete list of data that, according to the law, must be stored - provided that the service already has it - for example, <a href="http://publication.pravo.gov.ru/Document/View/0001201408060015">here</a> . <br><br>  In addition, the first block of amendments details the process of providing data to the authorized bodies - those that carry out operational search activities.  According to a certain procedure, they can request information from the organizer about any user and about the actions that he performed. <br><br>  Generally speaking, such procedures existed before.  By law, law enforcement agencies are entitled to request from any organization the information they need - if there are legal grounds and if the legal procedure is followed.  From this point of view, nothing has changed in principle.  It is also important that access to the contents of the user's mailbox - that is, its received, sent letters - is still possible only on the basis of a court order. <br><br>  Roskomnadzor began to maintain a register of information dissemination organizers.  At the request of law enforcement agencies there is entered the name of the service and contact details of its owners.  This is a kind of address book.  And all organizers are obliged to comply with the law on data storage, regardless of whether they are in the registry or not. <br><br>  The bloggers are concerned with the second block of amendments.  According to him, bloggers have additional responsibilities similar to those of the media.  The appearance of these duties depends on the attendance - if a blogger has more than 3000 visits per day, he should himself turn to Roskomnadzor and register in another registry.  Legally, the register of information dissemination organizers and the register of bloggers are completely different things, unrelated to each other.  Yandex is listed in the register of information dissemination organizers. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/237395/">https://habr.com/ru/post/237395/</a></p>
