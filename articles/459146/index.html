It helps to make the accessible zone (tunnel) wide enough so that the interaction with the drop-down list, slider, video chronology and other similar element is comfortable. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/cda/e9e/d13/cdae9ed132cb9092c7cec91e9c2f3b6d.png"><br><br><h4>  <a href="https://www.nngroup.com/articles/applying-discounts/">Applying Discounts and Promotions on Ecommerce Websites</a> </h4><br>  Tips on literate presentation of promotional codes on Kim Flaherty online stores from Nielsen / Norman Group. <br><br><h4>  <a href="https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2019/06/ux-optimizations-keyboard-only-assistive-technology-users/">UX Optimizations For Keyboard-Only And Assistive Technology Users</a> </h4><br>  Aaron Pearlman offers tips on how to optimize keyboard navigation for users with disabilities. <br><br><h4>  <a href="https://webframe.xyz/">Webframe - Beautiful web app screenshots</a> </h4><br>  Another catalog of interface patterns. <br><br><h4>  <a href="https://www.nngroup.com/articles/required-fields/">Marking Required Fields in Forms</a> </h4><br>  Memo Raluca Budiu from the Nielsen / Norman Group on the selection of mandatory fields in the forms.

This year, iOS has been allocated to a separate branch of the iPadOS.  <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019/06/03/the-ipad-is-getting-its-own-os/">What interesting happened to the interface</a> : <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/60d/c3c/f28/60dc3cf281ad4f8025beaa92a5befc07.jpg"><br><br>  <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019/06/03/ipad-apple-files-thumb-drive-sd-card-ipados/">More serious work with the file system</a> after all those tales of the uselessness of this ‚Äúoutdated concept‚Äù.

But they described a <a href="https://www.adobe.com/products/xd/design-systems/spectrum-design-system-driving-next-generation-creative-tools.html">good universal approach</a> that could potentially help make different applications homogeneous.  The team recently <a href="https://www.designernews.co/stories/102687-ama-the-team-behind-adobes-design-system-spectrum">answered questions from Designer News</a> .

They make a branch in the components, which, if successful, merges into the main code and is accessible to everyone. <br><br><h4>  <a href="https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2019/06/building-design-systems-interview-brad-frost/">When Do We Need A Design System?</a>  <a href="https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2019/06/building-design-systems-interview-brad-frost/">An Interview With Brad Frost</a> </h4><br>  A brief interview with Brad Frost about his current projects and the nuances of the introduction of design systems. <br><br><h4>  <a href="https://medium.com/deliveroo-design/how-to-use-voice-and-tone-in-ux-writing-a66981c78d20">How to use voice and tone in UX writing</a> </h4><br>  A useful reminder of Rhiannon Jones from Deliveroo for choosing the right key for interface texts.

True, the "tokens" is already a more well-established and accustomed word. <br><br><h4>  Material design </h4><br><ul><li>  The Google design team briefly talks about creating a <a href="https://design.google/library/material-design-dark-theme/">dark theme for photo apps, calendars, news, and Android Auto</a> . <br></li></ul><br><h4>  <a href="https://medium.com/facebook-design/a-content-strategists-guide-to-using-tone-in-products-bae168b6534c">A Content Strategist's Guide to Using Tone in Products</a> </h4><br>  Susan Gray Blue from Facebook describes the company's approach to the tonality of texts in the interface.  They do not try to guess the mood of the user, because this is impossible, but they try to be adequate to the specific situation. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/25a/b2e/567/25ab2e567a37a6002fa06bf1e6da24cd.jpg"><br><br><h4>  <a href="https://diez.org/">Diez</a> </h4><br>  The service helps to store design system tokens and distribute them to a bunch of platforms and frameworks.  Well, collect them initially from the design tools. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/c04/fa4/adc/c04fa4adcfb1cc5dd526a2ad1ae353ae.jpg"><br><br><h4>  Storybook </h4><br><ul><li>  Version 5.1 will help <a href="https://medium.com/storybookjs/instant-accessibility-qa-linting-in-storybook-4a474b0f5347">check components for accessibility right in the live guide</a> .

Sketch Cloud shared space, versioning, centralized distribution of plug-ins and symbol libraries, viewing screen specifications in a browser without Zeplin.  As in Figma, you only pay for the editors, and not everyone with a single view of one screen.  The beta version will appear in July. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/07e/ca2/223/07eca222359c35ed5d444b279da5e5f3.jpg"><br><br>  And in version 56, the most ancient and stupid pain will be solved - the characters themselves change size as content changes.  Do not have to change the width of the hands of the buttons?  Plus a component panel will appear next to the layers (as in the Figure).  And the change in distance in the group of objects (also in the Fig). <br><br><h4>  Plugins </h4><br><ul><li>  <a href="https://sketch-to-web.com/">Sparkle</a> : The plugin turns a tool into a promo site builder - you can build it and get ready-made code. <br></li><li>  <a href="https://xlayers.dev/">xLayers</a> : The application allows you to assemble a finished site from the layout.  And you can get both static and component version on React and Angular. <br></li></ul><br><ul><li>  Dmitry Kovalenko from Readle made <a href="https://uxplanet.org/sketch-data-4d22f823253c">three hundred data sets</a> .  Names, mail addresses, devices, countries, airports, etc. <br></li></ul><br><h4>  <a href="https://www.getpresto.co/">Presto</a> </h4><br>  The service allows you to quickly assemble a learning tour for the user.  The authors have targeted sellers and customer support, i.e.  use to help a particular person. <br><br><h4>  <a href="https://search.muz.li/">Muzli Search</a> </h4><br>  Search Muzli collections well complements Pinterest to collect the mindboards. <br><br><h4>  <a href="https://www.figma.com/blog/plugins-are-coming-to-figma">Plugins for Figma</a> </h4><br>  Announced plugins.  They promise reliable and trouble-free operation when add-ons do not break when the tool is updated.  A beta version for developers is already available.  This was one of the main functional claims shifting from Sketch. <br><br>  Bonus: <a href="https://www.figma.com/blog/kick-start-your-typography-system-in-figma/">Memo to create a typographic system</a> .  More basic theory of building a font scale, but there are examples of patterns directly in Figma. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/4f6/e4d/f5a/4f6e4df5a0bcc29955ac1c8e3d5e15b2.jpg"><br><br>  This is reminiscent of a tipping point in the race of Android and iOS - at some point they so strongly broke away from competing platforms like Windows Phone, Tizen, Sailfish, WebOS, and others that all attempts to catch up with their heads lost meaning (with all the money from Adobe and InVision) .
