It is enough to register on the site sk.ru and fill out an application for obtaining the status of a Skolkovo member.  The application passed the formal verification stage in 1 day and went for substantive examination. <br><br>  The substantive examination is a meeting of the Expert Board on the issue of whether your project meets the following criteria.  Following the meeting, experts vote.  At the exit you get a verdict on the passage / not passing the project, an assessment of 5 points and abstracts from the experts. <br><br>  <b>5 points of voting.</b>  <b>The project is considered quality if for each of the 5 points scored more than 50% of the possible points.</b> <br><br><ol><li>  The created product and (or) technology and (or) the expected result of applied research (that is, scientific research, the commercialization of the results of which is expected no later than five years after the Applicant submits an application for assigning the Project Participant status (an application for the preliminary examination of projects); - Applied Research) have potential competitive advantages over world peers; </li><li>  The created product and (or) technology and (or) the expected result of Applied Research has a significant potential for commercialization, at least in the Russian, and in the future - in the global market; </li><li>  The project is theoretically realizable and does not contradict the fundamental scientific principles; </li><li>  Key researchers, developers and project managers (hereinafter referred to as the Project Team) possess the necessary knowledge and experience for the successful implementation of the project and (or) the implementation of Applied Research; </li><li>  The project team has a specialist or several specialists with international experience in the field of research, development and (or) commercialization of their results. </li></ol><br><br>  <b>Actually assess the project KickBrick (FlashKick)</b> <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/558/748/085/5587480858034d7a8f4bc906ce90e3b3.png"><br><br>  <b>Informational letter with theses</b> <br><br><blockquote>  <b>Dear applicant for the status of a participant in the project for the creation and maintenance of the Skolkovo Innovation Center!</b> <br><br>  In accordance with clause 7 of Article 2 of the Regulations on the assignment and loss of the status of a participant in a project to create and ensure the operation of the Skolkovo Innovation Center, approved by the Foundation Council and agreed by the Board of Trustees, and Articles 3 to 5 of the Regulation on Expert Collections of the Non-Profit Organization Development Fund of the Development and Commercialization Center New technologies approved by order of the Foundation, your project was sent for substantive examination to 10 independent experts. <br><br>  <b>Unfortunately, the experts found that the information provided by you is not sufficient for the substantive examination of your application.</b>  <b>In particular, the experts indicated the following:</b> <br><br>  The project can be evaluated and the project result can be evaluated.  Provided evaluation is the right. <br>  -The documentation is much less than a project to production. <br><br>  - If it is difficult for applicants to prepare an application in the required form, then it is better to really apply to crowdfunding. <br>  - Competitors are not reflected. <br>  The experience of the participants is not presented in sufficient volume for the assessment <br>  The founders were just too lazy to carry out work both in comparing their product with competitors and in presenting their own experience in this field. <br>  - There is a lack of product description, that is, its application, namely, a description of the principles of operation, disadvantages and advantages ... and further development or other areas of application. <br>  - The project description in the application is very incomplete. <br><br>  1. Insufficient analysis of potential analogues and competitors.  On the basis of such an analysis, it would be possible to at least approximately estimate the consumer market for such devices, and not to refer to the overall market assessment on health gadgets, which can hardly be considered an adequate assessment? <br>  2. In the application there is no justification of the commercial component of the project.  There are no cost estimates, no potential market estimates, no estimates of development costs. <br>  3. From the description I did not have the impression that the methodical component of the project was worked out.  In particular, how the training will be carried out in real time ‚Äúwith feedback from the gadget to the athlete‚Äù, allowing you to adjust the training process. <br>  4. The technical component is also unclear to me.  In particular, how the gadget is configured for a specific pear, which may have different design features, varying the signals from the sensors. <br>  - The submissions for project evaluation are sufficient. <br><br>  In this regard, on the basis of sub-clause 7 of clause 7 of article 2 of the Provision on the assignment and loss of the status of a participant in a project to create and ensure the functioning of the Skolkovo innovation center, we are forced to leave your application from?  for Flashkick project without consideration. <br></blockquote><br><br>  I am inclined to agree with the opinion of the college, I approached filling out an application as a form of registration on the site.  Given that Albert Efimov <a href="https://geektimes.ru/users/abulaphia/" class="user_link">Abulaphia</a> (Head of the Skolkovo Foundation Robotic Center) explained later that the application should be worked out more like a serious technical document or scientific work. <br><br>  There are many stories on the Internet with a similar ending.  There are examples when projects that did not take place in Skolkovo were gladly accepted into other international technology parks.  Of course, this does not mean that my project is one of those that should be necessarily successful.  But for me, this experience has been extremely rewarding.  I was able to look at Skolkovo from the other side, I wrote several posts <a href="https://geektimes.ru/post/274024/">1</a> , <a href="https://geektimes.ru/company/robogazon/blog/274086/">2</a> , <a href="https://geektimes.ru/post/276234/">3</a> , <a href="https://geektimes.ru/company/robogazon/blog/276422/">4</a> . <br><br><h2>  Our days.  Return to project </h2><br>  After the commission‚Äôs response, I felt some disappointment, I think this is normal, but I didn‚Äôt want to continue developing the project.  In August, there was a break in karate classes, and I felt the need for my gadget, since classes on a soulless pear, unlike a living enemy, do not give those feelings.  A certain analogy suggests itself here, but no, we will not develop the topic. <br><br>  I realized that this could be a great way to dilute the training process.  If I myself need this device, then there is a chance that he will be in demand.  In general, these thoughts led me to write a post.  Now five people are helping me with the project, for which they are very grateful. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/bce/708/ef0/bce708ef020541a5aa0d86709dcc2956.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/f62/bab/8a0/f62bab8a0da6413da3fc8432ea652315.jpg"><br><br>  In my understanding, you need to develop a gadget capable of issuing differentiated light and sound signals to signal the need to produce various types of strokes, connecting not only hands, but also strikes by other parts of the body.  Ideally, this should be a personal trainer with the ability to monitor progress and the training process, draw up a training program, display a certain average reaction time or a certain rating of all users.  Additional features may be data synchronization with existing cloud solutions. <br><br><h2>  Development of hull design and device design </h2><br>  The work is done by <a href="https://geektimes.ru/users/nikitakhvoryk/" class="user_link">NikitaKhvoryk</a> .

It is possible that 10 boards in the first revision for arduino on modules may not be required, but this is a minimum order, and getting experience in ordering boards in China is priceless. <br><br>  An alternative option was to order <a href="https://easyeda.com/order">here</a> and <a href="http://www.seeedstudio.com/fusion_pcb.html">there</a> in Rezonite.
