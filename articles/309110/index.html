  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Logic hoster: not caught - not a thief. How to prove the opposite. Service Overview HostTracker Part 3</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  The monitoring service <a href="http://www.host-tracker.com/">HostTracker has</a> created a set of tools that facilitate the work with the site and the diagnosis of problems for specialists of all levels - from casuals to webmasters.  In particular, these tools help to quickly diagnose and fix various problems with hosting: for example, to assess how real the SLA responds to the stated one.  If it doesn‚Äôt comply, request a transfer to a higher-quality server, or find a better hosting.  What is the theory and practice of the issue - we look under the cut. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/22d/353/cb6/22d353cb6f6548d39bf9f1ca18616996.jpg"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  In the previous parts of the review ( <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/company/host-tracker/blog/307462/">first</a> and <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/company/host-tracker/blog/307784/">second</a> ) it was about the basic functions of the service and the history of its creation.  This part is devoted to the practical application of data collected by <a href="http://www.host-tracker.com/">HostTracker</a> . <br><br><h3>  What do we see in the logs? </h3><br>  One of the originally conceived tasks for HostTreker is to provide evidence for butting with a low-quality hoster.  In recent years, they have become more responsible (and we hope that the trend will continue).  Nevertheless, even now there are frequent situations when a particular hoster denies the obvious things and does not admit his guilt.  But here comes the superhero in the face of HostTreker, whose logs are clearly visible when it was a failure and what exactly it showed up.  Actually, everything is simple with logs - but for convenience they are divided into several categories.  First, the actual audit log: 
      <br>
        <script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>
        <ins class="adsbygoogle"
          style="display:block; text-align:center;"
          data-ad-layout="in-article"
          data-ad-format="fluid"
          data-ad-client="ca-pub-6974184241884155"
          data-ad-slot="8945601208"></ins>
        <script>
          (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
        </script>
      <br>
    <img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/d7a/4ee/7ee/d7a4ee7eef134256bbde363beaf0d77f.png"><br><br>  By default, checks with the same status (if the site works all the time, or, on the contrary, gives the same error) are combined into one record for ease of viewing.  Still, otherwise, with a monitoring interval of 1 minute per day, 1,440 records will be generated, try to find what you need.  But there is a possibility of separate logging, if you need to check something especially carefully.  Also separately made a list of errors - again, for the convenience of the search.  In addition, for certain errors, it is possible to save and view a snapshot - how the site looked at the time of the error.  Of course, this works in cases where at least some response from the server being verified is received.  For example, the search for the keyword worked - something important was lost (or appeared) from the page. <br><br>  Secondly, there are graphs of checks for download speed and response time, which can also be useful for a number of tasks.  Especially considering the fact that HostTreker servers are located all over the world.  In the settings of the task it is possible to select a region of the world to check.  Thus, it is possible to see how the site behaves for users from a specific region of the world.  This is convenient - you can check from the countries in which the target audience of the site is located and not worry much about different Australians, although there is a possibility of verification from Australia. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/19e/e9b/0b8/19ee9b0b89134b6a888b0b734b9dedfe.png"><br><br>  Quickly determine exactly when the crash and view the history of the site, you can use the chart uptime.  Which, by the way, with the help of the widget is easy to place on your site, so that every time you do not go to HostTracker. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/6f0/56c/319/6f056c3194cf4c5e9d795df1c89c33bd.png"><br><br>  Of course, if you have access to your server logs, then most of the problems with the site can be found in them.  But first, you need to know where to look.  And secondly, the problems can be external and in the internal logs do not stay up.  Together, these data can help diagnose any problems and predict the future. <br><br><h3>  Data: what is for yourself and what for hoster </h3><br>  As a result, the following data is logged: <br><br><ul><li>  Domain status and certificate. </li><li>  The checked IP address (in case the site can reolvovatsya on several addresses).  This is useful for customers who use data distribution systems ‚Äî they immediately know exactly where the error is. </li><li>  Response time and download speed.  It is possible to limit the region of verification and see how quickly the site loads, for example, from Eastern Europe.  Or make a global picture. </li><li>  Codes of all recorded errors, if possible - snapshots are made during an error. </li><li>  For more complex tasks - for example, database monitoring - various values, checksums, etc. can be saved. </li></ul><br>  Links to this information can be made open, and you can also download this data in PDF / XML / CSV formats and kindly provide the hoster as evidence of its swearing.  There were cases when customers sought compensation for poor-quality services.  Often, these checks have encouraged the host to improve the quality of services.  At least for these customers.  Moreover, practice shows that systematically setting up a host with these reports brings tangible results: transferring the site to a faster server, real attention to it from the side of hosting support, etc., which many grateful clients wrote to us about.  There are also cases of moving to another hosting.  Or, for example, you can catch the moment when you need to switch to a higher tariff plan due to the increase in site traffic. <br><br>  We always welcome your questions and suggestions, because, I dare to remind you, our service is developing, first of all, thanks to the requests of our clients, well-wishers and critics. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/309110/">https://habr.com/ru/post/309110/</a></p>
