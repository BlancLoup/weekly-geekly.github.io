The kit consisted of: the main block keyboard, the electronics gaming manipulator, a power supply unit, several connecting wires, a pair of reels with games (after some time they were copied to audio tapes), an instruction manual, a brochure with a description of Basic commands and examples of commands all sorts of different programs. <br><br>  <b>Computing unit.</b> <br>  Represents the "touch" keyboard of those years.  The contact of the buttons was closed by pushing the top surface.  It should be noted that this is not the best keyboard for programming, but it looked very unusual.  Most of the ‚Äúkeys‚Äù have 5-6 values, and sometimes it took quite a long time to find the desired value from the code.  Pushes have been sounded through TV.  I would also like to note that the TV "Birch" had to be upgraded to make it possible to use the console. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/51f/b5c/f24/51fb5cf2483fc4523652a7530b92eeac.jpg"><br><br>  Inside, they are waiting for us: a <b>Zilog Z80 processor</b> , two K573RF4A <b>RPZUs</b> (about this device with macrophotographs below) and a dozen four logic.  I got an Astra at seven, and the K573RF4A already attracted by its appearance.

Perhaps to trigger in narrower positions of the lever. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/d8e/d84/ff9/d8ed84ff9ec8005c3886a2df98714351.jpg"><br><br>  A couple of years after Astra (1990-1991), the consoles Dendy, Sega, and others began to appear. Someone would recall gaming clubs with similar consoles such as Astra (Spectrum and other analogs).  Surely, the most popular game in these clubs were airplanes.  The games were different, for the most part - arcades, rarely there were ‚Äúthree-dimensional‚Äù arcades, and, of course, old Pacman.  From the examples of the programs presented in the manual, there were all sorts of colorful animations, all sorts of divers, who descended to the bottom of the sea (I can‚Äôt find a book, I would make a couple of photos). <br><br>  Astra gathered at the Small Enterprise "ROBOT" in Minsk <br><br>  Let's return to the device <b>K573RF4A</b> <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/6de/9b1/2dc/6de9b12dc4d10a94c8bd4dae2cee980b.jpg"><br>  Engineering beauty ... <br><br>  It has already been written above that the K573RF4A <i>is a reprogrammable 64 Kbit (8k x 8) Permanent Storage Device with ultraviolet erasure and electrical information recording.</i> <i><br></i>  <i>Contains 169579 integral elements</i> <br><br>  It has eight-bit organization, with simultaneous reading of 8 bits. <br><br>  The letter size is roughly roughly 58 microns.  What this label means, I did not find on the network.  RF86P or RFVBP. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/0f6/c0a/93b/0f6c0a93b8673ebaf598a46e5febbbae.jpg"><br><br>  The structure of the <i>storage matrix with memory cells</i> : <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/e68/131/32f/e6813132f1e5f93174116de7407119ca.jpg"><br><br>  Excerpt from the <a href="http://rud.exdat.com/docs/index-660951.html">lecture</a> : <br>  <i>Ultraviolet erasure ROM is based on a memory matrix of memory-based memory, the internal structure of which is shown in the following figure:</i> <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/78e/d3e/08a/78ed3e08a5c1dd27b1ae23f3736bc76d.png"><br><br>  <i>The cell is a MOS transistor, in which the gate is made of polycrystalline silicon.</i>  <i>Then, in the process of manufacturing a chip, this gate is oxidized and as a result it will be surrounded by silicon oxide, a dielectric with excellent insulating properties.</i>  <i>In the described cell, when the ROM is completely erased, there is no charge in the floating gate, and therefore the transistor does not conduct current.</i>  <i>When programming the microcircuit on the second gate, located above the floating gate, high voltage is applied and charges are induced into the floating gate due to the tunnel effect.</i>  <i>After removing the programming voltage on the floating gate, the induced charge remains and, therefore, the transistor remains in the conducting state.</i>  <i>The charge on the floating gate can be stored for decades.</i>  <i>The block diagram of the permanent storage device does not differ from the masked ROM described earlier.</i>  <i>Only instead of the jumper the cell described above is used.</i>  <i>In reprogrammable ROM, erasing previously recorded information is carried out by ultraviolet radiation.</i>  <i>In order for this light to pass unhindered to the semiconductor crystal, a window made of quartz glass is embedded in the microchip body.</i> <i><br><br></i>  <i>Upon irradiation of the microcircuit, the insulating properties of silicon oxide are lost and the accumulated charge from the floating gate flows into the volume of the semiconductor and the storage cell transistor goes into the closed state.</i>  <i>The erase time of the chip ranges from 10 to 30 minutes.</i> <i><br><br></i>  <i>The number of write cycles - erasing microcircuits is in the range from 10 to 100 times, after which the microcircuit fails.</i>  <i>This is due to the damaging effects of ultraviolet radiation.</i>  <i>These chips most often store the BIOS programs of universal computers.</i> <br><br>  From different angles of illumination you can consider multi-level routes of the tracks. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/6b1/148/8d8/6b11488d83896c57ec8839322fda5069.jpg"><br><br>  Microelectronics, of course. <br>  Thank. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/214475/">https://habr.com/ru/post/214475/</a></p>
