But no, it's still not that ... With the experiences that, at a tender age, I received from the primitive pixels of the Spectrum or Dandy there is little that can be compared.  And then, what a thrill to play a game that mimics reality?  Is this reality a little at work, at the university, in public transport? <br><img src="http://emu.deminiv.msk.ru/images/mario2.jpg" alt="Super Mario Brothers"><br><br>  Here we are, retrogrades, and looking for entertainment of the past century.  You can return them in several ways. <br>  One of them is to download an emulator (for example, <a href="http://fceux.com/web/htdocs/">FCEUX</a> ), find ROM images of the cartridges from your favorite console, readjust video and sound, and - it went, flying! =)

      But this is for people who are fond of.  To do this, you need to spend time searching, downloading, setting up - and if you just want to choose a game, press the ‚ÄúON‚Äù button - and relax overloaded Moscow?  It all bothered me, Google did not suggest satisfactory solutions.  I had to take the bull by the horns and do everything myself. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a>  What came of it? <br><br>  Understandably, you need to implement an emulator right in the browser.  In order to play it was possible for users of any OS, the choice fell on the Java platform. <br>  It turned out that there are already a number of projects involved in NES emulation (if anyone does not know, it is so cleverly called Dandy) under Java.  For example, <a href="http://www.nescafeweb.com/">NEScafe Emulator</a> , or <a href="http://virtualnes.com/">vNES</a> . <br><img src="http://emu.deminiv.msk.ru/images/nescafe.jpg" alt="NESCafe"><br><img src="http://emu.deminiv.msk.ru/images/vnes.jpg" alt="vNES"><br>  The first one immediately attracted by its customization capabilities.  But having tried to run Contra, I quickly lost interest in it.  The emulator didn‚Äôt slow down on the weakest car itself, and the implementation of the control caused an acute allergic reaction in me: for example, it was simply impossible to direct the character‚Äôs gun in any direction.  Those who played Contra (and there are those who did not play?) Will confirm that playing it in this mode is a sophisticated masochism. <br>  But vNES pleased: he was fast.  Compared with NEScafe - VERY fast, and I immediately felt a warm feeling for him.  One thing was depressing - there were few settings, and the management was hard-coded in the code.  Actually, the video settings did not interest me, but it was necessary to change the management.  The default layout seemed unnatural to me: the direction arrows correspond to the arrows on a conventional keyboard, and the A and B buttons correspond to the Z and X keys. That is, just the opposite, than on the console's joypad. <br><img src="http://emu.deminiv.msk.ru/images/nes_joypad.jpg" alt="Joypad"><br>  The developer of vNES left me a loophole - the system is distributed by the GPL, and therefore the possibility of modification is limited only by the user's laziness.  Having danced with a tambourine and a file around the sources, I made a system that satisfies me! =) <br>  The rest was pseudo business - the web-interface for selecting the game and the control settings was created as if in a spirit, and as a result, it turned out what happened. <br>  Meet  <a href="http://emu.deminiv.msk.ru/nes">Dandy Online! =)</a> <br><br>  The project so far includes a few games, but over time they will be replenished.  First of all, of course, I will add those games that users request.  One restriction: the site will only those games for which I can find the original cartridge. <br><br>  Comrades!  Please comment. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/75890/">https://habr.com/ru/post/75890/</a></p>
