But prosaic instructions will not be interesting to anyone - a different format is needed!  And we decided to write our own ‚Äúbad advice‚Äù following the example of those that in the 90s of the last century caused stormy delight in many. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/06d/2fb/3e1/06d2fb3e1930d39e93bcd6296e13e029.png"></div><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  In our work, we could not but mix up the irony on the healthy part of the provocation (for it was painful).  We guarantee the absence of extremism, attempts to insult the feelings of believers and direct incitement to violence (even in case we had to activate our legal service, and then the times are hectic).

      In order to smooth out possible roughness, we, in the best traditions of technical support services, added ‚Äúaccompanying tips‚Äù added accompanying comments, with tips that were at least harmless.  For clarity and consolidation instructive impact. <br><br>  *** <br>  If something is broken, <br>  Doesn't work at all, <br>  Mend the damage themselves <br>  Do not try ever. <br>  No matter how much you want <br>  Figure it out yourself <br>  Understand what is happening - <br>  You are not up to now. <br>  Postpone manuals <br>  Usergames and how-to. <br>  First right away <br>  Get angry and grumbling. <br><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Prose comment</b> <div class="spoiler_text">  Understanding what, at what point in time and after what happened, will help you and technical support to better decide in which direction to work.  Help details and facts. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/81b/4ad/b76/81b4adb76586faa766196e7a55ef4f42.gif" width="400"><br></div></div><br>  *** <br>  Blow your cheeks hard <br>  Beat your fist on the table <br>  Yell at pet <br>  You can still kick a foot. <br>  If there is no cat at home, <br>  There is no dog and ferret, <br>  You get off at home, <br>  It will add you strength. <br>  If you sit in the office, <br>  You forget about Bonton, <br>  Scream at a colleague <br>  He is to blame for everything. <br><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Prose comment</b> <div class="spoiler_text">  If you are upset, anxious or angry, it‚Äôs best to admit it immediately, speak out to yourself or out loud.  Sometimes it helps to wait a few minutes before acting.  Having calmed down, begin to build a plan of action.  From the question "how do I feel," go to "what should I do."  This involves a rational part of your "I." <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/13b/9ff/307/13b9ff307900be895b182bb8ce2f9754.gif" width="400"><br></div></div><br>  *** <br>  Pissed off well <br>  So the blood knocks in the temples, <br>  Dial the number safely <br>  Technical support you own. <br>  You will not be answered there immediately <br>  Help you do not want <br>  Measure expectation <br>  You are in seconds by the hour. <br>  And when they answer, right away, <br>  Without hindrance and delay, <br>  Scream at the sacrifice. <br>  Defend, attack. <br><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Prose comment</b> <div class="spoiler_text">  Consider whether you want to call, because in a good support team, as a rule, there will be several ways to open an application.  If the problem does not require intervention this second, and I want to tell a lot, in writing to formulate your request, sometimes it will turn out better. <br><br><div class="oembed"><div><div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"><video controls="" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;">  Your browser does not support HTML5 video. <source src="https://g.redditmedia.com/l2wQHuHfjzGanXdCui2jFINqdRAbvW26FwiacbknPJc.gif?fm=mp4&amp;mp4-fragmented=false&amp;s=05b5a55f0e5986be2ec60a1d8e507a90" type="video/mp4"></video></div></div></div><br></div></div><br>  *** <br>  Know only, do not forget <br>  Before you is your blood enemy, <br>  Though not death wishes you <br>  But certainly not good. <br>  Will this devil is evil <br>  In the soul to climb and puff brains. <br>  Bring out the devil wants <br>  Your secret secrets. <br>  A lot you don't say <br>  Be mean to words, <br>  Let the techie himself understand <br>  What broke and why. <br>  Or better hurry <br>  Tell the sun has risen, <br>  Tell the forest woke up <br>  Tell that from everywhere. <br><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Prose comment</b> <div class="spoiler_text">  In a good support team, attention is paid not only to the technical knowledge of the staff, but also to listening skills, emotional intelligence and empathy.  The employee will not be indifferent, and the questions that you ask will be in the case and sent to isolate the problem. <br><br>  And yes, say a lot and say nothing - two equally harmful advice. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/70b/d80/554/70bd80554c19152eb69aeade00471f71.gif" alt="image"><br></div></div><br>  *** <br>  To be more confusing <br>  From the work of technical support, <br>  You applications for a carbon copy <br>  Better to make seven at once. <br>  And when they ask logs <br>  To solve the problem, <br>  Hid them well <br>  And forget where they lie. <br>  Protocols and logs <br>  They only look dumb, <br>  And skilled craftsmen <br>  You will be helped without them. <br><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Prose comment</b> <div class="spoiler_text">  Any more or less complex application writes its own logs, which are created precisely so that in case of problems you can understand what is happening. <br><br>  From the number of applications and the number of technical support engineers to whom all these applications are received, the chances of increasing priority and solving the problem will not increase much.  For this, as a rule, there are more effective methods: in a good support service there will be an opportunity to change the priority, request a call and even complain to the team management. <br><br><div class="oembed"><div><div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"><video controls="" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;">  Your browser does not support HTML5 video. <source src="https://v.redd.it/v19cq6u4fco11/DASH_4_8_M" type="video/mp4"></video></div></div></div><br></div></div><br>  *** <br>  If you are in response to a request <br>  They write a long letter, <br>  Read only the topic, <br>  Anything further is not for you. <br>  And they will ask you to do something <br>  To gather, to learn, to test, <br>  Ignoring the lazy people <br>  Do the opposite. <br><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Prose comment</b> <div class="spoiler_text">  Sometimes, without your help, the support staff cannot cope.  It happens that something can (and sometimes should) be taken by the user himself. <br><br>  And yes, in good technical support they are unlikely to deliberately ask unnecessary questions or stuff with unnecessary information.  Of course, it may be that you write long letters from the inability to write briefly, but it is better to still read to the end.  And it is better to consciously approach the answers to the questions. <br><br><div class="oembed"><div><div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"><video controls="" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;">  Your browser does not support HTML5 video. <source src="https://g.redditmedia.com/Q4N4G8AwWaZWFPYqdzIHVqhhUINljGeiz5QIM-9onys.gif?fm=mp4&amp;mp4-fragmented=false&amp;s=a0600e2ffc1e2773f98a8ba3157ee0a1" type="video/mp4"></video></div></div></div><br></div></div><br>  *** <br>  To solve problems <br>  React cool <br>  You are being cheated again, <br>  Not a solution at all. <br>  And evidence attempts <br>  Put in doubt. <br>  The mind here with the case is not neighbors, <br>  Say: "I do not believe." <br>  If they give you a choice <br>  Options are not one, <br>  Unambiguously and in the case <br>  Feel free to say yes. <br><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Prose comment</b> <div class="spoiler_text">  The guys from Veeam support, in addition to the products themselves, must know and in various degrees be able to ‚Äújuggle‚Äù a dozen different technologies (VMware, Hyper-V, networking, Windows / Linux OS, databases, Exchange, AD, tape- and cloud-solutions, etc. d.).  If a problem goes beyond the limits of our products, we try to isolate it within a technology, system or level and tell what to do next.  And in some cases we help with communication with another vendor. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/094/dfc/54b/094dfc54bb890ba4c2195d1f41fba89d.gif" width="400"><br></div></div><br>  *** <br>  If in personal correspondence <br>  You do not see the lumen, <br>  Insert caps word urgently <br>  √öRGENTR–çTIKALAS√ÅP. <br>  To make it more fun <br>  With engineers to fight, <br>  Share this burden <br>  Copy a bosses. <br><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Prose comment</b> <div class="spoiler_text">  Acronyms like ASAP are used so often that they have lost their original magic.  A much more effective method is to explain why the problem is important to you or your business.  For a good support service, this will be enough for your application to increase its priority. <br><br><div class="oembed"><div><div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"><video controls="" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;">  Your browser does not support HTML5 video. <source src="https://g.redditmedia.com/UFBiawfdLihqL47ynuSEyVjwCLaxEmHRCtNNAZ195pU.gif?fm=mp4&amp;mp4-fragmented=false&amp;s=89dde22bd75aac569781dd63111097a4" type="video/mp4"></video></div></div></div><br></div></div><br>  *** <br>  If you fight with support, <br>  And the problem did not dare, <br>  These are just troglodytes, <br>  You want to live from the light. <br>  No matter how hard it is for you <br>  You do not stop the war, <br>  This is not about deciding <br>  And in the victory over the enemy. <br><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Final spoiler</b> <div class="spoiler_text"><div class="oembed"><div><div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"><video controls="" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;">  Your browser does not support HTML5 video. <source src="https://v.redd.it/mbktcrmof2q11/DASH_600_K" type="video/mp4"></video></div></div></div><br></div></div></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/426777/">https://habr.com/ru/post/426777/</a></p>
