  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Promotion of mobile applications</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  According to statistics, 59% of mobile applications do not pay back the costs for its development. <br>  An original idea and a good implementation are only half the way to success. <br>  A good application, but without marketing, is likely to fail, and a bad one with proper promotion can pay for itself tenfold. <br><br>  Next, we analyze the techniques of promoting the application without investing. <br><br><h5>  ASO optimization </h5><br>  It takes two steps and each has its own purpose: <br>  1. Directly search engine optimization (SEO), <br>  2. Visual optimization.

      The purpose of the first is to increase searching ranks.  That is, make it so that your application can be found by as many people as possible using a search engine. <br><br>  There are three main free admissions. <br>  1) The name of the application.  It is very important to choose the correct name.  It mainly depends on him how many people will find you using the search.  Try to make the title include the main keyword search words. <br>  <b>Example: an</b> application on the theme ‚ÄúEntertaining games for parties‚Äù is better called ‚ÄúEntertainment for parties‚Äù.  Immediately 2 keywords: entertainment and parties.  It is not necessary to call, for example, "Entertaining" or "Mimosa". <br>  2) Description.  Most users read only the first paragraph.  Try to make it as informative and attractive as possible.  Also use maximum keywords in the text. <br>  <b>Example: an</b> application on "Cooking".  Use in the description of the following words: cuisine, recipes, delicious, cooking, and so on. <br>  3) Translation.  User growth up to 15%.  Use the main languages ‚Äã‚Äã(English, German, Chinese, etc.).  Try to provide a high-quality translation and not translate the text in Google translator, other programs. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  The purpose of the second step is to increase the attractiveness of the application. <br><br>  1) Icon.  First of all, users look at the icon, then at Screenshots, and only at the end of the description.  Therefore, pay special attention to the application icon.  The icon should reflect the essence of the program and stand out from the competition. <br>  2) Screenshots.  Also very important item.  Make screenshots that show your application at its best. <br>  3) Promotional video.  You can make a demonstration of the program, where try to hide the roughness of the graphics application, show only the most successful solutions. <br>  4) Translation Screenshots.  Up to 30% user growth. <br><br><h5>  Alternative app stores </h5><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/45a/688/a78/45a688a7825c43a25feeb0be07be3e47.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Despite the fact that the audience at alternative stores is much smaller, there are cases when downloads on Amazon or Samsung apps are 10 times higher than on Goggle Play.  Since there is competition at times less.  Due to this, your applications are easier to get to the tops and occupy higher lines in the search engine. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/dd1/ee7/ffc/dd1ee7ffc991a57ac17adc74f04812fb.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><h5>  Placing reviews on sites and forums </h5><br>  A very important part of the promotion. <br>  One of the most effective techniques.  Well increases downloads and creates user feedback.  Suitable mainly for free applications only, as in most cases you need to upload the apk file. <br><br>  1) Opening topics on the forums.  We prepare a good description of the program, Screenshots and create a theme. <br>  2) Placement of announcements and reviews on sites.  In the search engine we write ‚ÄúAndroid applications‚Äù we open the first 20-30 found sites and contact the administration with a request to post a review of your application.  Pros: for free, quickly, after publications on 5-10 sites, other sites will copy the information about the application from them and post reviews of your application. <br><br><h5>  Social networks </h5><br>  1. Creating the official pages of the application, the brand on Facebook, Twitter. <br>  2. Creating Facebook Fan Pages. <br>  3. Social integration.  as the main trend (FB, Twitter, Instagram, Foursquare). <br><br>  1,2) Strongly help in the marketing of applications social networks. <br>  Facebook is the entire internet in USA.  On the company \ application page place announcements of programs, updates, information on the development course and so on.  Subscribers will never miss the release of a new application, and since they have subscribed to the page, we can assume that they liked previous developer projects and they are likely to download new programs. <br>  3) Especially effective point for the promotion of games. <br>  Allow the user to place on the page on the social network his achievements, etc. <br>  <b>Example:</b> tell friends about getting achievements, opening a rare item, passing a level, and so on. <br><br><h5>  Downloads on different days of the week and holidays </h5><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/5ed/97d/477/5ed97d4778a640c5a1508a7b252258e3.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  As we see on weekends and holidays, there are more downloads than on weekdays. <br>  Try to publish the application before weekends or holidays, it will help you quickly get into the top "new free \ paid".  It will be even more effective if you get to other tops, on the highest line possible during the weekend or holiday period. <br><br><h5>  Hit the top </h5><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/e76/b0d/efd/e76b0defd57ef21ec8fdf9634ea9b714.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  To increase traffic, you can try to get to the top. <br>  Free - long and hard <br>  Fee - quickly and very expensive.  Doesn't always pay off. <br><br>  <i>Several ways to get to the top.</i> <br>  1. Bot Push - $ 20,000- $ 30,000 // not very honest <br>  2. CPI in TOP-25 <br>  iOS Free Apps: <br>  a) depending on the category - $ 276 (weather) - $ 23,500 (games) per day // do not write weather applications <br>  b) TOP Free - $ 35,500 per day // does not always pay off <br>  3. Special services <br>  a) FreeAppADay - $ 7,000 per day // profitable if there is content being sold inside the application <br>  b) ComboApp - $ 4,900 for getting into the TOP-100 paid by application category // is useless if it is not a game <br><br>  <b>More about FreeAppADay</b> .  If your application is paid and it has content to be sold, you can make the program free for one day and post the news on the main page of a special site for $ 7,000. <br>  Why should we be selling content?  Because the application is paid, and even if 5000-100000 people download it for this 1 day, but for free, there will be 0. And with the content being sold, these 50,000-100000 additional material downloaded by potential buyers. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/3ca/b75/45e/3cab7545e13d1ced1481ae1a45170936.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><h5>  Mobile Analytics Tools </h5><br>  Distimo <br>  Flurry <br>  Bango <br>  Mixpanel <br>  Apsalar <br>  Mopapp <br>  Ksuite <br>  Localytics Mobile App Analytics <br>  AD-X <br>  Prosper202 <br>  MediaLets <br>  Crittercism <br>  Appclix <br>  Amethon <br>  AdMob Analytics <br>  etc. <br><br>  From the list I use Flurry and AdMob Analytics. <br>  From the merits of Flurry I want to highlight the ability to watch the number of application errors and their logs, a very useful thing. <br><br><h5>  Practice and Results </h5><br><br>  Using some of these techniques, my application for 25 days took 18th place in the top of new free and 8th place in the top of its category. <br><br>  It is expected the decline of downloads after 1 month, as the application will be removed from the top of the new free. <br>  Therefore, it is worth the maximum amount of effort to promote your application during this 1 month, if your application is in the top of new ones.  And by jumping from this top to get on as high as possible in the top by category. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/161981/">https://habr.com/ru/post/161981/</a></p>
