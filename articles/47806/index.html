      Then, I decided to promote the idea abroad and after long torment I posted the news on digg.com.  In the process, I realized that this is a monstrous site that supposedly allows you to publish any social news, but in fact, there were many people like me there, so my news immediately went down a few pages.  Thus, my access to the open Internet did not take place) -: <br><br>  And, I forgot, I also placed an advertisement in the Yandex.Direct using the keywords a gift, March 8, the new year ... and so on. <br><br>  All the above actions gave about 200-400 visitors per day, but this result naturally did not suit me, therefore, I decided to engage in hyphalology more vigorously. <br><br>  Remained after work, made a standard set in a notebook (email, project name, text description in Russian and English. Languages), so that each time not to re-enter the data in the questionnaire. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  So, I started looking for sites where you can post news about a new project for free ... <br><br>  Started with foreign. <br><br>  Here I found a list of western social <a href="http://www.aucklandseo.com/2008/01/17/social_news_websites/">media-</a> oriented sites <a href="http://www.aucklandseo.com/2008/01/17/social_news_websites/">www.aucklandseo.com/2008/01/17/social_news_websites</a> ( <a href="http://www.aucklandseo.com/2008/01/17/social_news_websites/">see the</a> list below).  Opened all the links at once, began to register. <br><br>  Separately, it is worth noting the generally brainless and ill-conceived usability of Western resources.  I am from these sickening questionnaire bangers.  The sites themselves are oversaturated with spam and all sorts of nonsense, it‚Äôs not interesting to read them directly.  But I wonder where they have such attendance from? <br><br>  Well, okay, live in a flock, howl in wolves. <br><br>  I started copying my news and half of the sites simply did not accept them for one reason or another, somewhere not enough time had passed since the registration, somewhere my rating was not great enough, but somewhere I just did not figure out how to publish news. <br><br>  In short, the most effective site, from those where we managed to publish the news, was <a href="http://www.reddit.com/">http://www.reddit.com/</a> .  Immediately after posting, as many as 15 people have entered the site!  And perhaps this is an exception, rather than the rule. <br><br>  Then I went over to the Russian sites.  I notice that among Russians there are three types of 1- thriving sites 2 - rotting startups 3 - and those who give 404 errors.  Type 1 is the most pleasant, these include sites like Habra and Derti.ru.  The rest is all bullshit.  After sending 10 news I did not receive a single transition to the site.  By the way, here is a list of Russian sites where you can post news <a href="http://community.livejournal.com/smo_ru/32088.html">http://community.livejournal.com/smo_ru/32088.html</a> . <br><br>  So, the process started, I sent out the news.  If attendance does not grow at least twice, I will assume that my plan failed. <br><br>  But in this case, I have a plan B. But I‚Äôll tell you about it most likely next year.  And now, already 12 at night, it's time to go home, sleep a minute. <br><br>  <b>List of Western sites</b> <br><br>  1. Reddit: a popular social news site with a large community.
