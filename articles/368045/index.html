We collected the most popular names among male subscribers and reduced their prices by February 23.  Therefore, our gift is simple: it is a discount.  You can sit at the computer on any of the holidays yourself and choose the goods participating in the holiday promotion.  And in the post we will talk about gadgets and other devices that we found in the process of selecting sales objects. <br><br> <a href="https://geektimes.ru/company/gearbest/blog/271462/"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/b43/582/a7e/b43582a7ec4a4ed0a51487242a6cf0e9.jpg"></a> <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  By the way, all this time there will be an <a href="http://www.gearbest.com/promotion--special-396.html%3Futm_source%3Dgeektimes%26utm_medium%3Dyulia%26utm_campaign%3Dg16">instant sale</a> with some very good offers. <br><br><h2>  Puddle, solder, computer fix </h2><br>  If you often have to solder boards, work with thin wires, or repair some household trifles, you can buy a mini soldering iron working from USB.  <a href="http://m.gearbest.com/other-tools/pp_240618.html%3Futm_source%3Dgeektimes%26utm_medium%3Dyulia%26utm_campaign%3Dg16">A soldering iron</a> (5V, 8W) is a handy thing for soldering thin wires, contacts, household trifles such as chain clasps.  The soldering tip heats up in 15 seconds, cools in less than half a minute.  If you forget about him, he is unlikely to have time to burn a table a few millimeters, as is the case with large soldering irons - automatic shutdown occurs after 25 seconds.  The device weighs only 21 grams, the feeling that there is a pen or a pencil in your hand, is simple to work, it is easy to ensure the accuracy of movements.  By the way, in addition to it, it is better to immediately buy it for soldering, for example, <a href="http://www.gearbest.com/hand-tools/pp_194426.html%3Futm_source%3Dgeektimes%26utm_medium%3Dyulia%26utm_campaign%3Dg16">such</a> (although its site is just a huge selection).

We have reduced prices, first of all, for <a href="http://www.gearbest.com/development-boards/pp_156163.html%3Futm_source%3Dgeektimes%26utm_medium%3Dyulia%26utm_campaign%3Dg16">Raspberry Pi 2</a> single-board computers, with which you can not only comprehend the basics of computer science, but also do really cool things, for example, to control other devices.  Specifically, this model is equipped with a quad processor Broadcom BCM2836 900 MHz ARM Cortex-A7 and 1 GB of RAM.  As it turned out, our efforts to reduce prices were noticed even by Yandex.Market. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/63c/919/430/63c919430fac4a3ba971cd5f4e6a25b4.png"><br><br>  Another find is the <a href="http://www.gearbest.com/development-boards/pp_211519.html%3Futm_source%3Dgeektimes%26utm_medium%3Dyulia%26utm_campaign%3Dg16">Arduino Starter Kit</a> .  Suitable for anyone who wants to touch the magical and full of narcissism and pride in the world of DYI (DIY).  The kit includes everything you need for the first experiment.  By the way, an experienced Arduinsky kit also does not hurt - soon March 8 and you can collect a real IT card for your girlfriend. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/fd0/d35/335/fd0d35335faa4a90acee897d6a488ec8.jpg"></div><br>  While we were admiring the Arduino, somewhere in the depths of Gearbest a joke was born about a robot bringing beer to a chair in the evenings.  And what the hell is not joking?  Alas, we could not find such a robot as we wanted, but ... we already have an Arduino.  It remains to attach to his legs.  We also did not find the legs.  But they found the wheels, namely Arduino compatible <a href="http://www.gearbest.com/development-boards/pp_157852.html%3Futm_source%3Dgeektimes%26utm_medium%3Dyulia%26utm_campaign%3Dg16">DIY-cart with wheels</a> and a flat platform.  If you install a set of proximity and movement sensors into it, she can easily carry a jar of beer or cakes from you to other family members.  True, the resulting wheel cyborg is unlikely to open the refrigerator. <br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/5d0/ff9/890/5d0ff9890a834434a94e7fa9351d07fb.jpg"></div><br><h2>  Played - and that's enough </h2><br>  The world around us is captured by the myths about the fact that IT specialists only do what they write code and solder boards.  Lies!  Each of us has a house, a dacha and a garage in which something constantly breaks down and obsessively requires repair.  And surely everyone has a box with basic tools.  We found several gadgets that will make working with hand tools even more pleasant. <br><br>  Standing a penny, but a very necessary thing - a <a href="http://www.gearbest.com/screwdriver-screwdriver-set/pp_265250.html%3Futm_source%3Dgeektimes%26utm_medium%3Dyulia%26utm_campaign%3Dg16">flexible shaft</a> for an automatic screwdriver.  How many times we suffer to unscrew any screw or screw on the furniture or in a remote place, where the choice is clear - either move or leave as is.  The tips are compatible with the standard hex headings of our screwdrivers and screwdrivers. <br>  Not less useful thing - a <a href="http://www.gearbest.com/survival-emergency-gear/pp_86257.html%3Futm_source%3Dgeektimes%26utm_medium%3Dyulia%26utm_campaign%3Dg16">rotary wrench</a> with two movable heads for 4 sizes of nuts each (8, 10, 12, 13, 14, 17, 19, 21).  In fact, it replaces 4 wrenches that need to be constantly carried in the kit.  This key is suitable not only for home repair, but also for cyclists and car enthusiasts, especially the happy owners of domestic <s>designers of</s> carburetor off-road vehicles (running sizes of nuts 12, 13 and 19, 21, sorry, 22 and 24 need another key). <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/404/284/df4/404284df4f254937b3491f62411121ec.jpg"><br><br>  <a href="http://www.gearbest.com/temperature-instruments/pp_218366.html%3Futm_source%3Dgeektimes%26utm_medium%3Dyulia%26utm_campaign%3Dg16">Infrared thermometer is</a> designed for contactless measurement of the temperature of pipes, water and other surfaces.  However, the temperature in the apartment, he also measures quite accurately.  One of our employees has this - as one of the main advantages, he noted the possibility of teasing a cat with a red sensor point.  We hope you have a more serious use of the device. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/bd8/5c6/4ab/bd85c64ab66945e2ad677a61e46680d2.jpg"></div><br>  In our opinion, an absolutely useless, but very romantic tool: a portable <a href="http://www.gearbest.com/kitchen-dining/pp_79416.html%3Futm_source%3Dgeektimes%26utm_medium%3Dyulia%26utm_campaign%3Dg16">pencil engraver</a> working on glass, wood and metal.  With its help, you can put memorable inscriptions on templates or even metal flash drives on your own, without paying each letter of engraving.  Speaking of flash drives.  If your artistic abilities are really bad, you can choose incredibly <a href="http://www.gearbest.com/usb-flash-drives-c_11258%3Futm_source%3Dgeektimes%26utm_medium%3Dyulia%26utm_campaign%3Dg16">cool flash drives</a> .  For example, in the form of Star Wars heroes - to yourself or to your fellow friends. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/81f/460/ec4/81f460ec487b482c9a3bb0c5d8fd92f2.jpg"></div><br><h2>  What are we all about the little things, but about the little things? </h2><br>  Both tablets, smartphones, and action cameras are involved in the sale.  And, by the way, the adviser from Yandex.Market has repeatedly confirmed that with the price reduction, we tried our best. <br><br>  <a href="http://www.gearbest.com/cell-phones/pp_229218.html%3Futm_source%3Dgeektimes%26utm_medium%3Dyulia%26utm_campaign%3Dg16">XIAOMI RedMi Note 2 32GB 4G Phablet</a> is a phablet that has long been recognized among our customers.  Onboard the Android smartphone 5, 5.5 inches screen, 2 GB of RAM, 32 GB of internal memory, 13 mpx main camera, 8-core Helio processor, support for LTE, sensors, and so on.  This time for only $ 160. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/3ad/af8/43c/3adaf843c0de426397f065d127abeb87.jpg"></div><br>  <a href="http://www.gearbest.com/cell-phones/pp_218962.html%3Futm_source%3Dgeektimes%26utm_medium%3Dyulia%26utm_campaign%3Dg16">The MEIZU M2 4G smartphone</a> for $ 119 is a 5-inch phone with enough power even for loaded games, a good camera, 2 GB of RAM, 16 GB of internal memory, work in LTE networks.  Another deservedly beloved Chinese smartphone. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/beb/89c/754/beb89c7542bd403abb662e883b37a2ae.jpg"></div><br>  For a monster who knows a lot about perversions, we dropped more than half the price of a 10.6-inch <a href="http://www.gearbest.com/tablet-pcs/pp_228787.html%3Futm_source%3Dgeektimes%26utm_medium%3Dyulia%26utm_campaign%3Dg16">Chuwi Vi10 Pro</a> tablet Android PC 4.4 + Windows 8.1 Ultrabook Tablet.  Already from the name it is clear that simply will not: the tablet is running under two operating systems.  Responsible for the performance of a powerful processor Intel Z3736F 64bit Quad Core 2.16.  RAM 2 GB, built-in memory 64 GB.  For $ 147 - a very interesting gadget. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/872/931/646/872931646aea4c51941fc70f1bb021f6.jpg"></div><br>  On the eve of the summer cycling and kayak-hiking season, we did not ignore the action cameras.  <a href="http://www.gearbest.com/action-cameras/pp_298972.html%3Futm_source%3Dgeektimes%26utm_medium%3Dyulia%26utm_campaign%3Dg16">Camera SJ6000</a> will provide you with good video with a resolution of 1080p, shooting speed of 30 frames per second.  Removable battery lasts for 90 minutes of recording, waterproof case - at 30 m depth, supported memory card - 32 GB.  A good entry-level sports camera, $ 47, is a reasonable price to understand if you need expensive analogs and are you ready to constantly wear a camera on the head / handlebars, etc. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/a2b/aa6/8af/a2baa68af39a4f50a3c2a04cb3da07b5.jpg"></div><br>  <a href="http://www.gearbest.com/camping/pp_203032.html%3Futm_source%3Dgeektimes%26utm_medium%3Dyulia%26utm_campaign%3Dg16">Binoculars</a> , the dream of many boys, are equally inexpensive, but very good gadgets.  Light and durable binoculars will delight both you and your children not only with pleasant ergonomics, but also with quite good characteristics: an approximation of 12 times will make it possible to see birds, racers races from the stands, nature, the opposite bank of the river, <s>windows of the neighboring house</s> , elements of building decoration.  $ 19.5 is not the biggest price for fulfilling your childhood dream. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/dad/e62/958/dade62958a7c459fa163d03ee33470f3.jpg"></div><br><h2>  All this needs to be worn in something </h2><br>  Gearbest has a large selection of backpacks, wardrobe trunks, bags, etc.  For review, we stopped at two very functional models.  This is a camouflage <a href="http://www.gearbest.com/duffel-bags/pp_346.html%3Futm_source%3Dgeektimes%26utm_medium%3Dyulia%26utm_campaign%3Dg16">backpack</a> with a lot of compartments and a durable textile <a href="http://www.gearbest.com/duffel-bags/pp_102494.html%3Futm_source%3Dgeektimes%26utm_medium%3Dyulia%26utm_campaign%3Dg16">bag</a> with an unexpected fastening at the waist and under the foot (as it seems to us, the best outcome for the evolution of a belt bag from the 90s) <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/425/af3/407/425af340780244478df2623917409df6.jpg"></div><br>  A durable nylon backpack will hold almost everything you need during a hike, trip or business trip.  In addition, he has a very wide soft shoulder straps - they will not dig into the shoulders through the clothes and reap.  The bag is also good - due to the double attachment, it does not shake and does not hang out, like her grandmother, and several compartments will allow you to carry everything your: rights, tools, money, phone: easy to get, store under the protection of lightning.  In addition, if you get into a crowded place, the bag almost leaves no chance to pocket thieves, since your hand will be practically on it.  But most of all, such a bag is convenient for garden work and car repairs - everything is at hand, you do not need to call an assistant and change a comfortable position a hundred times. <br><br><h2>  And now for the little ones </h2><br>  It is a shame to admit this, but on February 23 we often forget to congratulate the very small, but very serious and business-like men - our younger brothers and sons.  But this is their holiday.  If you didn‚Äôt think about a gift for small things, add him to the choice, give a feeling of what he decides - show several options of gifts on the monitor, let him choose his favorite, and the good wizard will deliver it after a few days.  In the selection, we focused on your taste - how could we have lacked such toys in childhood! <br><br>  There was not enough <a href="http://www.gearbest.com/other-rc-toys/pp_119712.html%3Futm_source%3Dgeektimes%26utm_medium%3Dyulia%26utm_campaign%3Dg16">dump truck</a> - it was yellow, with a huge rising body.  It can carry sand, snow, candy - anything.  Radio-controlled, 31 cm in length, with huge wheels.  The cat will have a new enemy.  However, you can deliver dry food in the back - he will appreciate.  Probably. <br>  A controlled <a href="http://www.gearbest.com/r-c-cars/pp_103756.html%3Futm_source%3Dgeektimes%26utm_medium%3Dyulia%26utm_campaign%3Dg16">excavator</a> is a more expensive toy, but very useful: the complex bucket control and the platform itself develops coordination, teaches to distinguish right-left (which even adults continue to confuse).  Home-dreamers can assemble a <a href="http://www.gearbest.com/model-building-toys/pp_287864.html%3Futm_source%3Dgeektimes%26utm_medium%3Dyulia%26utm_campaign%3Dg16">model of a</a> pirate schooner from metal parts - at the same time and check patience and perseverance.  The model can be either a small surprise or an addition to the gift.  Well, the king of dreams - a radio-controlled <a href="http://www.gearbest.com/rc-cars/pp_166737.html%3Futm_source%3Dgeektimes%26utm_medium%3Dyulia%26utm_campaign%3Dg16">racing all-terrain vehicle</a> (just for those who have already dismantled the key SUV).  Passes on dust, primer, asphalt, grass, linoleum, the envy of all.  And yes, with the purchase of this machine, the child is just a cover. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/0ce/486/cc6/0ce486cc60404aceba3bbebbf54029f6.jpg"></div><br>  By the way, during our childhood, radio-controlled cars were not radio at all: they were firmly attached to the console with not very long wires and could only go back and forth.  And it was the best gift, causing incredible delight.  Now it is more difficult to surprise.  However, this is the lyrics.  There is a saying: good is twice as good when it is cheap.  We developed the action by February 23 in strict accordance with it.  In general, friends, have a good holiday and a stormy weekend! <br><br>  <b>PS:</b> just around the corner on March 8.  Perhaps something from the sale will prompt you an idea for a gift to your beloved girlfriend or mother.  Such products were also on the list.  By the way, many little girls love cars.  Let them also take part in the selection. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/368045/">https://habr.com/ru/post/368045/</a></p>
