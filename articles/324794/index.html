  <section class="page js-page"><h1>What is the difference between UI and UX? Detailed analysis of frequently used terms</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  In today's creative and technical environment, the terms UI (user interface / user interface) and UX (user experience / interaction experience) are used more than ever.  In general, they relate to the details and ideas that have been relevant for many years, even before the appearance of these abbreviations. <br><br>  But the problem with these concepts is becoming more acute.  These terms have become buzzwords.  Often their incorrect use in completely inappropriate situations is misleading the growing number of design professionals and more.  Understanding the differences, relationships and use of these terms is essential for correct work with them. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/b46/282/a2f/b46282a2f9064198b6a74cce73d10423.jpg"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h2>  UI! = UX </h2><br>  The most common misconception that you are likely to encounter in the workplace, meeting with the customer or in the list of vacancies and requirements is the unintended combination or interchangeability of these terms.  In many cases, an error is the expectation that the default interface designer understands or focuses on UX, just because his work is directly related to users.  The fact is that the user interface (UI) is not an interaction experience (UX).  Perhaps the confusion arises because of the letter "U" in both abbreviations.  More likely, this is due to the coincidence of the set of skills required for both disciplines.  They are certainly related, and, in fact, many designers are knowledgeable and competent in both.

      However, despite the coincidences, both areas differ significantly in their nature, and, more importantly, in their common goals and objectives.  The user interface (UI) is focused on the actual elements of user interaction - mainly physical and technical input and output methods.  UI refers to the accumulation of approaches and elements that allow the user to interact with the system.  It does not affect such details as, for example, the user's reaction to the system. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/5ac/c9e/421/5acc9e421b154c3ca73a8912d5536522.png"><br><br>  This leads us to the UX.  But be careful!  UX is much more than just the end result of user interaction.  On the contrary, it is better to consider it as the ‚Äúcore‚Äù of the brand.  Brand, in fact, is a combination of experience that a person owns in relation to a company or organization.  Interaction Experience (UX) is the goal.  Not only for the interface, but also for the product, organization.  When you reach a high level in UX, every desired or positive effect imaginable will come from there.  UX is focused on success in general.  In fact, it is not the product that is the sum of the components of the UX, but experience. <br><br>  In the end, all that remains for the user is to memorize.  As we all know, human memory is astounding, but by no means perfect.  Literally every detail contributes to the development of interaction experience, but at the output the user will remember everything somewhat distorted.  The UX contains many more elements than the UI, but it also relies on a large number of details.  Understanding this is the most powerful asset imaginable in product development. <br><br><h2>  UI is a tool </h2><br>  The user interface is one of the most powerful tools available to us for UX.  Why?  It's just that the interface is the most tactile and visible method by which users interact with us.  UI is the front line.  Most likely, this is a more or less acceptable explanation of why these two terms are so often confused or used together. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/669/224/f9a/669224f9aa7d406394be2c39c0df181e.png"><br><br><h2>  Misuse is risk </h2><br>  Communication sometimes misleads us.  Developing accurate and specialized terminology tools simplifies communication.  What do you think, what will happen if we misuse the terms, say one thing, and mean another?  Not the end of the world, of course, but the consequences will be ... A lot of time and money will be spent, and the result is unlikely to please.  Ultimately, all this can lead to bankruptcy, or the company's exit from the market.  Conclusion - incorrect use of terms has disastrous consequences. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/365/25b/ba2/36525bba28724eaba1eec7e015e1dd79.png"><br><br><h2>  Finding the right designer </h2><br>  Most often they are mistaken in defining UI and UX where it is most important: lists of vacancies and requirements.  Every day, finding a good candidate in such a narrow specialty, like UI and UX, is becoming increasingly difficult.  Worse, if you hire a person whose skill set will not match the position held.  Hiring a good specialist will cost you money, but a candidate who cannot complete the task will cost you much more.  Most often, when describing a job, the duties and requirements of the UI indicate, and the expectations as from the UX designer. <br><br><h2>  Responsibility for the problem </h2><br>  UI or UX is always design.  Design is the solution.  When roles are clearly defined and understood by everyone and everyone, it is much easier to attack the problem, propose a solution and implement it.  In the case of UI and UX, the problem usually arises when responsibility for both aspects falls on the shoulders of one person who simply cannot control both. <br><br>  It is rather difficult to solve a problem that you cannot afford, due to banal incompetence.  The UI designer can create interactive projects, icons, color, text and influence a number of other elements that are directly related to the interaction between the user and the system.  Such elements are fantastic tools that affect user experience, but they are only part of the equation.  The UX is influenced by many factors such as marketing, speed, performance, colors, personality, customer support, set expectations, financial approach, visualization, and so on. <br><br>  It would be rather strange to put the responsibility for all this on the developer's UI.  The same goes for the UX.  In order for a developer to rightfully take responsibility for the UX problem, he must be able to recommend and make changes, implement solutions to the problem and control the process.  Understanding the process depends on the capabilities and concentration of the designer.  The point is not that one designer cannot cope with both areas.  It is about tools and the ability to solve problems.  In fact, a builder without any materials and tools will not be able to build, just like a person without certain skills and knowledge. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/3f4/35a/5e3/3f435a5e366d41e89c26ec613152ba61.jpg"><br><br><h2>  Conclusion </h2><br>  The first step to storming any task is to define it.  Understanding the differences between UI and UX is your intellectual asset with positive consequences. <br><br>  From hiring the right person to simply understanding the requirements and terminology.  This is a great way to facilitate communication, improve the design and user interface. <br><br>  Translation of the article was prepared on the initiative of the <a href="http://pixli.ru/">Pixli</a> team. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/324794/">https://habr.com/ru/post/324794/</a></p>
