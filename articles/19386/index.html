  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Effective timekeeping</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Probably the most popular technique with which most people begin to get acquainted with time management.  This topic is already quite battered, so from the very beginning I will not explain it.  To whom it is interesting - I recommend reading the book of Gleb Arkhangelsky ‚ÄúTime Drive.  How to manage to live and work. ‚Äù  I'd rather talk about a few pitfalls that many of those who are beginning to keep timekeeping stumble upon.  Since the problems begin much earlier than they are expected.  Namely, at the time of the first recording.  Why? <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  To get at least some positive effect on timing, the first thing you need to determine the purpose for which you are going to use this technique.  Here it is important not just to raise your eyes to the ceiling, to dream that there will be more time, but to set the most specific goals.  Moreover, it will be better if you add timelines to your goals. <br><br>  Successful examples: <br><ul><li>  In a month I want to take up sports, for this I need to release 2 hours on Tuesday and Thursday at the end of the working day. </li><li>  I want to reduce my work day from 10-12 to 8 hours in 2 weeks </li><li>  During the current month I want to start giving 8 hours a day to sleep </li></ul><br>  Unsuccessful: <br><ul><li>  I need time for my personal projects. </li><li>  I want to make time to learn a foreign language </li><li>  I want to sleep more </li></ul><br>  What is the difference?  The difference in the measurability of the result.  In the first case, a specific result and a term is described.  You can track the duration of the working day and look at the calendar.  8 hours - great, more - we continue to debug workflows.  If there is no specifics, then soon, all attempts at organizing affairs will mix with the routine and come to naught. <br><br>  So, for what you can use timekeeping: 
      <br>
        <script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>
        <ins class="adsbygoogle"
          style="display:block; text-align:center;"
          data-ad-layout="in-article"
          data-ad-format="fluid"
          data-ad-client="ca-pub-6974184241884155"
          data-ad-slot="8945601208"></ins>
        <script>
          (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
        </script>
      <br>
      <b>1. To determine where your time is running out</b> <br><ul><li>  Your working day noticeably exceeds 8 hours, despite the fact that you seem to be solving all tasks on time. </li><li>  You do not get enough sleep all the time, although you come home quite early. </li><li>  You already want to go in for sports for a month, but you just can‚Äôt take the time to train. </li><li>  Your boss is not satisfied with your performance </li></ul><br>  There may be an infinite number of options, you need to determine one thing - what your time is spent on.  The result is sometimes amazing.  After 2‚Äì3 days of record keeping, it becomes clear that a huge amount of time is simply killed for conversations with colleagues, coffee, reading RSS and so on (and I don‚Äôt say that these are all unnecessary things, they just should not take up 25-30% working time). <br><br>  But in fact, the table of reports of time spent per n-days is practically of little use.  For full analysis it is better to use additional indicators.  In my practice of running timekeeping, I mainly use the following indicators: <br><br>  - Time spent on a specific group of cases <br>  For each entry in the table, in addition to the name, start and end time, an additional field is introduced - task group (work affairs, my projects, personal affairs, rest).  Thus, by the end of the reporting period (for example, the end of the week) we can sum up all the time spent on any group of tasks. <br><br>  - The importance and urgency of the task <br>  For each entry in the table, 2 fields are entered in which the numbers that characterize the priority of the task and its urgency fit into it.  Remember about the simplest classification of tasks?  They are important and not important, urgent and not urgent.  In order to achieve the best results and avoid rush jobs, it is worthwhile to engage in important and not urgent matters (so that they do not become important and urgent).  We summarize the statistics and draw conclusions on which class of tasks more time is spent. <br>  - Work-life balance <br>  It can be defined as the ratio of time spent on solving work problems to the time spent on personal needs and rest. <br><br>  This is how from a practically useless table we obtained a set of indicators by which we can correct our activity.  Again, each of them chooses (or invents) the set of these parameters himself, based on his own needs. <br><br>  <b>2. Timing for motivation</b> <br>  Timing, by and large, is an experiment.  And as a result of the experiment, not only information about a certain system / phenomenon is obtained, but also an effect on the object being studied.  How does timekeeping affect a person‚Äôs personal performance?  Mostly positive.  You see specific numbers: so much time is spent on VKontakte, so much in ICQ, so much is devoted to work.  Here the internal censor turns on and says: bear conscience, be engaged in business, in the end - of all.  This can be useful for the development of self-discipline.  But here the main thing is not to be under a delusion, as this result, usually, is short-term. <br><br>  The same feature should be taken into account when analyzing timekeeping reports.  At the same Gleb Arkhangelsky emphasis is placed on the fact that during the observation you should not make changes to the usual daily routine or change habits - because in this case the statistics will not reflect the real state of affairs. <br><br>  <b>3. Timing for planning</b> <br>  It's all pretty simple.  Having information about the time spent on certain tasks is much easier to plan or optimize workflows. <br><br>  Total, in order not to be disappointed in the timing you need: <br><ul><li>  Define a specific, measurable goal and duration </li><li>  Select additional indicators based on the goals </li><li>  Take measurements without changing habits and routines </li><li>  Analyze result based on selected metrics </li><li>  Adjust activity </li><li>  To keep track of time to fix the result (at least once a month) </li></ul><br>  I am sure that there will be people who will once again say: it does not work, it is a waste of time ... <br><br>  A waste of time is the use of time tracking without first setting a goal.  Timing in my understanding is a tool, it can not work.  Relatively speaking, from the fact that someone does not know how to use a chisel - it will not become useless from this, and the master with its help will create. <br><br>  Original <a href="http://deadline-as-lifestyle.blogspot.com/2008/01/blog-post_25.html">here</a> <br></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/19386/">https://habr.com/ru/post/19386/</a></p>
