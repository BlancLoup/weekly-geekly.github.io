Traffic. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  In fact, at the beginning there should be a small introduction about the varieties of games in which the above mentioned manipulators may be needed.  I am not a full-time player (I don‚Äôt know, fortunately or unfortunately ... I simply don‚Äôt have time for this, although I sometimes want to play), but I think I‚Äôm not mistaken if I‚Äôll name two kinds of races - arcade games and simulators. <br>  The first ones are more spectacular, but simpler in terms of management.  Developers do not make great efforts to create a realistic physical model of the behavior of a gaming car, but simply provide an opportunity to drive enough.  Due to their entertainment and gameplay, as a rule, such games are in great demand among many categories of players.  A typical example is the <b>NFS</b> series, <b>Race Driver: Grid</b> .

      Simulators - more serious business, and therefore less common.  The main advantage in such games is realistic control and a lot of settings that in one way or another really affect the gameplay.  Examples are <b>NFS Shift</b> , <b>Colin McRae Rally</b> , <b>Live For Speed</b> , <b>GTR</b> and <b>GTR2</b> , <b>rFactor</b> , <b>Richard Burns Rally</b> . <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/45f/f52/bda/45ff52bda7d40a138038d9f7f9001b12.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Even if my classification is not correct, this does not really change the essence - it is obvious that the steering wheel in races allows you to achieve greater immersion in the game than a pair of buttons on the keyboard. <br><br>  As you know, the main task of steering is to accurately measure the angle of deviation of the axis from the "origin", and then transfer these values ‚Äã‚Äãto the game.  Those.  if the bagel was physically turned 15 degrees, the same value (no more, no less!) should be passed into the game in order for the car to turn in the right direction. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/60d/ccc/73f/60dccc73fb94af91e415932f396cd924.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  The same with the pedals - the more sneaker on the floor, the faster we take off;) But this is where the most interesting begins ... <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/da1/cd2/5dd/da1cd25dd7f4276889f9dc7ed98dce4d.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  I think it‚Äôs no secret that every manufacturer of gaming peripherals is trying to invent something of their own - then there is a chance that the goods will be bought.  Therefore, at the moment, there are several technologies that are used in such devices.  To be precise, solutions to problem three (if someone else knows something about this, add!) - mechanical, optical, and magnetic.  Let's see what's what and where, what are the pitfalls. <br><br><h2>  Variable resistor (potentiometer) </h2><br>  The simplest and cheapest solution is that you could repeatedly see it in a huge number of devices, even in bearded years. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/dc5/7fe/e44/dc57fee449b2ca5aa0991f1ee528ee7f.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  The principle of operation is simple - a small gear is mounted on the steering axis (under the body, we do not see it), which is connected with another gear mounted on the potentiometer axis with its teeth.  Turning the steering wheel, the mechanism comes into action - the potentiometer contacts transmit the values ‚Äã‚Äãof the steering angle to the controller, and the one to the game.  It also happens that the axles of the pedals are directly connected to the potentiometers, but this does not make the weather - this ‚Äúclock‚Äù is designed in such a way that in any case there will be backlashes. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/6c4/d20/c00/6c4d20c0076258bb501b42e4df6c7093.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  They, in turn, are the cause of the ‚Äúdead zones‚Äù of the helm, when the game does not see minor steering turns.  And mechanical wear of parts will only contribute to this. <br><br>  But not a single play, the owner of such a device is fed up.  The main problem is the destruction of the engines and erasing the resistive track of the potentiometer.  One slider slides along the rotor, the second slides along the resistive path.  Nothing is forever - all these elements are erased.  For a more visual representation, below is a picture. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/999/879/ac1/999879ac11e359bb73d9a3b64f48e520.gif" alt="image"><br><br>  In the end, after some time, the potentiometer begins to give incorrect data (those who caught the Soviet televisions and radio receivers, on which the volume was adjusted just with potentiometers, should remember how the sound of the controller started to wheeze when the knob was turned - this is exactly how the internal potentiometer appears .  That is why the potentiometer cannot work for a very long time - you can‚Äôt argue against the laws of nature ... and everything that rubs will fail sooner or later.  And the more energetic you are, the faster it will happen. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/0b0/2d1/fe6/0b02d1fe626cc9a9321cdb8406b94e60.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  The result - an expensive device in a short time will be just a "visual" addition to the game, but not a means to get pleasure;) <br><br>  <u>pros</u> <br>  - Simplicity and low cost of manufacture. <br>  <u>Minuses</u> <br>  - The fragility to mechanical wear; <br>  - ‚ÄúDead zones‚Äù steering and pedals. <br><br><h2>  Optical sensor (encoder) </h2><br>  Another, more reliable solution to the problem is to use an optical sensor. <br>  The principle of operation can also be familiar to many more from the school course of physics.  On a special stand, a rotating disk with slots is fixed, the rotation reading from which is read by a fixed photocell.  Due to the fact that there is no mechanical contact between the ‚Äúwheel‚Äù and the photocell, mechanical wear is minimized.  BUT ... due to the fact that this disk has no "center" (origin), it has to be calibrated each time it is turned on. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/ae0/8f7/e62/ae08f7e62902411a33470c10374a8c77.gif" alt="image"><br><br>  That is why some steering wheels, when you turn on the computer or restart it, the built-in drive first turns the steering wheel to the end one way, then the other.  By dividing the obtained values ‚Äã‚Äãin half, the device will know from which position of the slotted disc it is necessary to produce reports. <br><br>  Despite the fact that the cheapness of the sensor itself is the place to be, the steering wheels on optics cost considerably more steering wheels on potentiometers.  It is because of the need to calibrate the developer steering on optics and is ambushed.  The sensor is cheap, but when turned on, do you know if the steering wheel is in the center position?  A commonly used solution - to put an electric motor that will turn the steering wheel to find the center.  But in order for the electric motor to turn the steering wheel, it is necessary to install a gearbox that will translate the high-speed rotation of the motor shaft into a smooth movement of the steering wheel.  As a result, a cheap sensor entails expensive mechanics - an electric motor and a gearbox. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/cae/90b/7d7/cae90b7d74b42abc83fcd30040852caa.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  There are usually no dead zones, but they can occur as the gears of the gearbox wear out, which can be killed even faster with the help of powerful feedback. <br>  Further down the list are quite large dimensions of the sensor and gearbox, thanks to which the optics are inserted only into the steering wheels.  Therefore, all the steering wheels operating on optical sensors are equipped with pedals on ... variable resistors, which were mentioned above) <br><br>  The result is a similar song, but for thousands more.  Force feedback (force feedback), which is realized at the expense of the engine mentioned above, can ‚Äúsweeten‚Äù emotions from additional costs.  Do not idle it just like that) But this does not solve the problems with the pedals! .. <br><br>  <u>pros</u> <br>  - Contactless, no friction; <br>  - Cheapness of the encoder itself; <br><br>  <u>Minuses</u> <br>  - Forced calibration required; <br>  - Large dimensions of the gearbox, it is difficult to install in the pedals; <br>  - The high cost of manufacturing the gearbox and the electric drive for calibration. <br><br>  Now is the time to make a small lyrical digression, because gradually we sneak up to the most interesting;) If we consider a more global field of activity, at least such as the automotive industry, then we can pay attention to the fact that all leading companies in most cases have long ago abandoned variable resistors and optical sensors in their cars.  Magnetic sensors are widely used, the largest supplier of which is the well-known company Philips, more precisely its subsidiary <b>Philips NXP Semiconductors</b> . <br>  Such sensors can be used anywhere - in the deviating backs of car seats, stuffed with electronics;  in the pedals and in the steering wheel, in the wipers, in the engine elements ... but where a lot! <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/mZUNKAgQ97M%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700023,15700186,15700191,15700253,15700256,15700259&amp;usg=ALkJrhhTtoi-YvD6p2lvwtxAr6DbPus-9A" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  It is unlikely that manufacturers would choose unreliable solutions ... so why not apply this technology in gaming products?  Indeed, in this case, the steering wheel will be in good foreign cars;) <br><br><h2>  Magnetic sensor </h2><br><br>  The principle of operation is as follows - a diametrically magnetised magnet is taken, which is securely mounted in the moving part of the body, in our case it is the steering wheel itself. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/13b/364/724/13b364724258cb8c18034d8a7fbfedcc.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  In the fixed case, the sensor itself is fixed directly, which processes the values ‚Äã‚Äãof the angles of rotation of the magnet. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/035/8fc/ae0/0358fcae0861e7172b5632d4483c8a69.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Due to the fact that high-tech electronics can work with a magnet at some distance from it, then there is no mechanical wear as such.  There is nothing to break either - small fragile parts are simply missing. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/26e/ae8/c55/26eae8c558b1d12be01c6937f7a861d8.gif" alt="image"><br><br>  The second barrel of honey in the fly in the ointment is the highest accuracy that is obtained with this approach - the electronics are capable of recording turns in hundredths of a degree! <br>  Well, the third not less pleasant bonus is the small size of the magnet and the sensor, which makes it possible to install them even into the steering wheel, even into the pedals.  Actually, they do that. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/8de/901/474/8de901474b2b6c93b6d29c809c45718a.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  <u>pros</u> <br>  - Contactless work, there is no friction and mechanical wear; <br>  - High accuracy and registration of the slightest deviations of the steering wheel or pedals; <br>  - Small size. <br><br>  <u>Minuses</u> <br>  - More expensive than resistors and optical encoders. <br><br>  Writing the text about the third type of sensors, there is unwittingly a feeling of pride in ‚Äúours‚Äù - while such solutions are applied only in the steering wheel of the little-known Russian company <b>Gametrix</b> .  At least no one, except them, currently uses this technology in gaming devices. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/7c5/1e3/1b9/7c51e31b9eca474edda5b6c24321c677.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  In this case, the sensors are named <b>MaRS</b> (Ma- nignal Resistive <b>S</b> ensor, Magnetic Resistive Sensor). <br><br><h2>  Theory vs practice </h2><br><br>  Folk proverb hints that it is better to see once than to hear a hundred times;) Well, let's reinforce what was said with a practical test. <br><br><h3>  For the experiment you will need: </h3><br>  - Three steering wheels (on three types of sensors - resistor, optical and magnetic) <br>  - The program <b>JoyTester</b> (for clearly displaying data received from the steering controller and pedals) <br>  - World champion of 2006 on the game in NFS - <b>Alan Enileev</b> :) <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/a17/ee4/b2d/a17ee4b2d77e53c1939bf20a77c69e99.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  So, first three steering wheels were taken, which were connected to the computer in series.  We will not play until - just a small field test in the program JoyTester.  This program in the coordinate plane draws lines corresponding to the steering angle or the degree of pedal depression. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/8f4/333/14c/8f433314c147006270fbcf95b494a9b3.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><h3>  Sensor on potentiometer </h3><br>  Let's start with the fact that the steering wheel does not handle the small deflections of the steering wheel to the right and to the left, which occur right near the ‚Äúcenter of coordinates‚Äù.  Those same dead zones that I talked about.  Those.  if you are rushing in a game in a straight line, you can not pretend to a hardened carrier who, in small turns, has full control over the road) Speaking easier, the game will not notice your efforts) Moreover, movements that occur at maximum angles of rotation are ignored.  Because of this, many people have the impression that all the steering wheels and games with steering wheels are garbage.  They say you spin the wheel, and the car at least henna.  It strongly hits the vanity of really experienced motorists;) <br>  The manufacturer is proud of the angle of rotation of the steering wheel at 270 degrees (and sometimes 900!), They say you can twist-twist-do not twist.  Well ... considering that almost everywhere an 8-bit controller is used, which provides 256 samples, the minimum angle of perception is 270/256 = 1.056 degrees.  This very degree, or rather the ‚Äúladder‚Äù that the game receives, we can see in the program, significantly rejecting the steering wheel. <br>  Another shortcoming is the non-linearity.  Those.  the difference between the actual deflection angle of the gaming device and the data transmitted to the game. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/63a/78e/207/63a78e20794f30f9838741f00f4a01f4.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Pedals are also something.  It all starts with the fact that the pedals do not handle the dead zone at the very beginning, and it amounts to neither more nor less - about 30% of the whole range (15-30 degrees).  The same 30% is the dead zone at the end of the range that the kit offers.  Total at our disposal is only 40 percent of the full pedal travel. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/1ef/463/110/1ef4631105031316af18c09661aead28.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  The result - we press the sneaker on the floor, and the game looks at this and frankly rzhot) Accordingly, you can not accurately ‚Äúdispense‚Äù the gas and brake - pressing the pedal 70%, the game will take them for 100. Where does it fit?  ) <br><br><h3>  Optical sensor </h3><br>  It's getting better here.  First, there are no dead zones, and secondly, the accuracy is much higher.  Data flows smoothly, there are no ‚Äústeps‚Äù.  The teeth of the gears of the gearbox, which are clearly felt when the steering wheel rotates, are slightly straining, but you quickly get used to them. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/6d0/b71/126/6d0b71126a78d169c6d6da349f5e0a35.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  But ... steering wheels on optical sensors are equipped with pedals on resistors) <br>  Pedals from the kit: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/245/537/a66/245537a6656bc14ca3c272ade7741ba6.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Data comes in jerks (steps are clearly visible), at the beginning and at the end are large dead zones.  That, however, is not surprising. <br><br><h3>  Magnetic sensor </h3><br>  In <b>Gametrix Viper there are</b> three magnetic sensors - one in the steering wheel and two in each pedal (they allow to handle turns and taps from 0.06 degrees). <br><br>  For a more obvious difference in behavior, a model was assembled, in which two sensors are used for one steering wheel - magnetic and resistor. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/188/6c7/818/1886c7818813856e6f3c45e4e9714f2b.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/9c7/91e/7f4/9c791e7f4d902c3b6cee085bb12f79af.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Run the program and ... I think no comments. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/39b/320/bd4/39b320bd480ae648807a0c0230e4985d.png" alt="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/5e2/c5f/fff/5e2c5ffff64fc659b7e6726da0aa8691.png" alt="image"><br><br>  But if you do not understand anything - the magnetic sensor registers even the smallest deviations of the steering wheel from the center, fully fulfills the whole range that the steering wheel provides ... and the same goes for the pedals.  I think this is exactly what game developers are counting on, releasing their masterpieces. <br><br><h2>  3 ... 2 ... 1 ... GO! </h2><br>  Well, perhaps the most interesting part of the test.  Alan Enileev, the world's best virtual race car driver of 2006, was offered a ride in the game under the supervision of programs such as <b>JoyLogger</b> and <b>WheelTester</b> . <br><br>  Analyzing the recording of the game Alan, it was found that the most popular angles of rotation in the game are in the range from -20 to +20 degrees from the center.  It is the degrees that are in the rudder potentiometers in the dead zone;) <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/074/02c/591/07402c59146d6c8605d8c8adba2498f3.png" alt="image"><br><br>  It also turned out that, on average, the player makes one movement with the steering wheel per second.  And considering that the resource of a budgetary potentiometer is only 800,000 cycles (800,000 seconds), the game time for which the steering wheel is designed is only 250 game hours!  Well, or a little more than 10 days of continuous play ... mda. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/c5e/cc6/7a0/c5ecc67a0e1c262def949d2de2cc3da1.png" alt="image"><br><br>  If you play 2-4 hours a day, the pleasure will last only 4-6 months (in fact, here you can pay attention to the warranty period, which most manufacturers provide).  Even if after this time the wheel remains alive, the testimony given to them in the game will be far from the real ones. <br>  But this is just a crumb inside a device that we don‚Äôt even see ... I‚Äôm not even talking about other artifacts that come out on cheap devices. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/c91/be3/1cb/c91be31cb4e710e2b109aaff43fa3e55.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Any arguments still need?  ) <br><br><h2>  Total </h2><br>  If you are really not indifferent to car simulators on a computer, then without joy and pedals "joy will be incomplete."  The range of gaming devices on the market is now very wide, but in fact, they are all the same - only the "skin" is changing.  Therefore, the first advice is to not enter the placer buttons, heaps of pedals, all sorts of ryushech and other zakos under famous brands like Ferrari (oh, by chance there was an association with Cherkizovsky majors in Harley Davidson jackets).  Yes, all these fashionable riches can be beautiful, but ... 15 kilobytes of the text above are confirmed by practice and numerous forum topics. <br>  Nothing lasts forever - any product, and even more so subject to active mechanical stress, will fail sooner or later.  But the timing of life in these devices vary greatly.  Therefore, I think it is better not to have a separate item of expenditure, buying a new set of steering wheels and pedals once a year, but buying once, but durable and more functional product.  So if you met two steering wheels of the same appearance, but the price of one is only 1,000 rubles higher, consider you lucky - you probably have a long-playing Gametrix Viper;) Unlike other steering wheels, this one gives you a 5-year warranty. <br>  After the purchase, game developers will remain in debt - really high-quality car simulators can now be counted on the fingers. <br><br>  <b>* UPD:</b> <b><a href="http://narod.ru/disk/14382715000/JoyLogger.rar.html">JoyLogger</a></b> and <b><a href="http://narod.ru/disk/14382751000/JoyTester.rar.html">JoyTester programs</a></b> .
