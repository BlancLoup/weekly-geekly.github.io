      <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/visualstudio/ru-ru/events/scheduleMoscow.aspx">www.microsoft.com/visualstudio/ru-ru/events/scheduleMoscow.aspx</a> <br><br>  I arrived at about 9.15 Moscow time.  Metro station Sokolniki.  There were colorful signs on the street, it was difficult to get lost.  Got just in the midst of registration.  There were many people.  We were registered in several streams - according to the letters of the alphabet.  But, all the same, my turn "I-N" was the longest, so a bit later the letters were scattered around the neighbors.  In principle, the guys worked quite quickly, and in less than 5 minutes, I received a badge and a bag of advertising.  Advertising was different, not only from Microsoft, but also from other sponsors of the conference.  Also gave a DVD with materials konfy, well, and a couple of promotional discs.  Immediately we were waited for morning tea / coffee with buns and sandwiches (in general, they were fed, as usual, often and well, I feel, Microsoft loves plump clients).  Slightly wandered around the territory, pleased with the XBOX zone.  Well, it is, in principle, too, as usual.  The audience was very variegated - from students to gray-haired CIOs. <br><br>  Actually, having finished the preparations, I went to the hall where the plenary report was expected.  While the guests were gathering, we were quietly entertained with songs to the guitar.  To whom both, but I liked it.  Guys, nobody knows, and who played it?  Many people, including me, liked tvitetris: the messages of the participants of the discovery, coming to twitter live, were decorated in the form of falling blocks of tetris.  There was also almost a win-win lottery.  I won the handgam there.  Other participants received baseball bats (check the code!), Business card holders, watches, maybe something else was, did not make out.  As one of the guests noted later, the people came running for a freebie. <br><br>  Then there was a plenary report on which all the keynote speakers of the conference spoke a little bit, so we could decide where we want to go.  The main presenter was Denis Kotlyarov.  I will not talk about the content of the reports, I will simply list where I went and how much I liked them.  Records of reports, I believe, will be posted, if not already laid out.  I went to the report of Mikhail Chernomordikov on modern Widows applications, and Silverlight in particular.  In addition to being an excellent speaker, he is also a wonderful person.  By and large I will say that if it were not for him, then I would now serve somewhere on a submarine, and not study in graduate school.  Misha, do not get tired of repeating it - thank you!  Then he went to the report of Marat Bakirov, dedicated to the interaction of testers and programmers.  As expected, a good tester, everything broke and did not start under his strict guidance, and then the computer went into a reboot altogether.  I like it.  Then listened to the report of Sergei Orlik.  No offense, he had the best report from all that I heard that day.  Sergey was so enthusiastically telling, and was so able to captivate the public that the assistant girl had to quietly countdown on large A4 sheets, but still we took the extra time, and then we covered Sergey with questions.  Well, actually, the guest, he is the nail of the program, Brian Harry.  I told about Team Foundation Server 2010. Many, including me, took the headphones with a translator.  You know, they almost did not need.  Brian told everything in such a simple language and showed that everything was clear.  During the report, literally, shouting Next, he installed and configured TFS.  Plus migrated from VSS. <br><br>  Then there was a lottery with valuable prizes and beer.  And there was Allah.  Who was he will understand.  For her work she received the first prize.  =) <br><br>  Overall impression.  It was a presentation not so much of VS 2010 itself, as of the entire updated and completely new infrastructure that is built around it.  Now we can expect a truly complete and integrated support for the entire life cycle of a software product from the creation of the architecture, through its development and testing, to the final release.  Someone will say that many of the applications presented are not needed, they are superfluous, imperfect, and so on.  I do not know the guys, time will tell.  But my opinion is a holistic and complex product, and it is a sin not to use it. <br><br>  <strong>PS</strong> <br>  As a true Sipishnik and MFC, I look forward to a report from Terry Leeper on Thursday about buns in VS 2010 for people like me.  In general, I was pleased that my brother at Microsoft began to pay attention again. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/90776/">https://habr.com/ru/post/90776/</a></p>
