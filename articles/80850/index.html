Of course, they are also mortal, but, first of all, vain.  Why not use this simple, in general, thing as a driving force for a startup? <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/e7f/c7f/213/e7fc7f2131b81295c92b8be270e9a090.jpg" alt="illustration"><br><br>  I warn you right away - everything that will be described below is my leisure conclusions.  I myself, unfortunately, not a programmer, and certainly not a start-up.  But!  It may well be that these very conclusions will seem interesting and applicable in practice. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  So, we proceed from the simple reasoning that <s>all people lie,</s> all people are vain.  Accordingly, everyone has already laid out a photograph in a bathing suit (swimming trunks) on classmates and started the album ‚ÄúI'm at Sea‚Äù in ‚Äúcontact‚Äù (tea is not village, I saw the sea).  What's next?  And further, it is assumed that the user desperately needs some kind of piping gauge (this is where the most important ambush lies, but is it really necessary? But we will go the way of mathematicians and say: suppose you really need it).

      <b>Mechanism of work</b> : so, each Vasya (and even more so Pete) just needs to know where he, in fact, is in this world.  It is clear that not on the first.  But not the last! <br><br>  So, the user logs in on our website (let's call him loudly - ‚ÄúRuNet persona‚Äù, drives in the system addresses of his social profiles (in contact, classmates, LJ, facebook, myspace, twitter, etc.). Then the system analyzes the number of friends, the number of comments to posts, etc., and calculates a one-off coolness rating (denoted by tsifirkoy.) The user is given a code to insert into the blog, forum, etc., so that he can easily post it anywhere and be proud. <br><br>  Now the most interesting: the rating is constantly changing.  It is necessary for the user to perform an action, as his rating starts to jump both up and down.  Those.  wrote a post, received comments, and immediately grew up in his own eyes by a couple of hundred points (or in other words, he became steeper than 200 unknown people).  As experience shows, at the same Habr√©, a rating increase of 2-3 points is able to extol several thousand points in the rating.  Interpolating these thoughts on the whole RuNet, and considering the general passivity of the audience, the take-offs should be even more impressive.  I think it should be exciting. <br><br>  <b>Regarding the counting</b> : each resource must bring a different number of points.  Those.  some will be more valuable, others less.  For example, a post in LiveJournal with a large number of signs should ‚Äúcost‚Äù more than a couple of posts to Twitter.  And for overactive and popular users (such as ‚Äúother‚Äù and Lebedev), it is necessary to introduce decreasing coefficients.  Because the inertia of popularity works on them, whatever they post it).  But, of course, this is discussed and conjectured. <br><br>  <b>Monetization</b> : the first thing that comes to mind is text advertising in the insert rating code.  The second is to work out statistics on users and sell it to interested agencies. <br><br>  In general, something like this.  Naturally, the details are not spelled out, but this, so to speak, is a general concept :) <br><br>  <b>UPD</b> : the trick of the service, after all, is not to show you where you are (most people don‚Äôt get into top positions, it‚Äôs the majority), but to see how easily you jump over the heads of a large number of people.  And jump from the slightest sneeze.  Those.  play vanity. <br><br>  ps I wonder if someone realizes it, should I wait for a check?  :)))))))) </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/80850/">https://habr.com/ru/post/80850/</a></p>
