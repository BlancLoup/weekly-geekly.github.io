For example, if we decode on a CPU, then on 30-35 MBps streams on Intel Core2 Duo E8500 3.2 GHz, frames are starting to fall out.  The processor is quite fast, the difference in performance compared to the core Sandy Bridge at the same frequency will be about 20%.  Qualitatively squeezed full-HD film can create problems, not to mention the original streams from Blu-ray, there the stream can reach 45 MBps.  Owners of laptops usually have weaker processors, and not all desktop systems with powerful CPUs.  Another case where the CPU becomes a bottleneck is deinterlacing.  Deintrlacing is necessary when viewing streams of satellite HD channels, streams there with a reasonable bitrate (usually 10-15 MBps), but software deintarlace eats up all the remaining resources.  Moreover, high-quality deinterlace, without flushing and with preservation of fps, are heavy for the CPU.  The only way out is to use the hardware decoding offered by modern GPUs.  About video from satellite channels, it should be noted that they are partially damaged, because  reception is not always perfect, so it is important that the player stably digest such ‚Äúbreakdowns‚Äù in the stream. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  In Windows, hardware decoding is implemented through the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DXVA">DXVA</a> API.  All modern AMD and Nvidia GPUs implement DXVA as a separate physical module (AMD - <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unified_Video_Decoder">UVD</a> , Nvidia - <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nvidia_PureVideo">PureVideo</a> ).  These modules are made specifically for this task, they work almost identically as in the video cards of primary and senior classes.  Intel's situation is more complicated.  Only in CPU cores Sandy Bridge Intel added <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intel_Clear_Video">Intel Clear Video HD</a> module.  Previous generations of Intel graphics formally performed acceleration, but the implementation was using GPU shaders, which was enough only for 720p video and it seemed to me to be very inefficient in terms of energy consumption.  For this reason, owners of most laptops with Intel graphics cannot afford to watch full-HD video.  CPU utilization with DXVA is a few percent, while DXVA provides high quality deinterlace.  Manufacturers provide additional decoding settings, such as motion smoothing in 24/25 fps movies through the generation of intermediate frames (similar functionality is available on televisions), the elimination of noise, etc.

      In practice, there are often streams that go beyond the specifications of Blu-ray and there have been problems with DXVA decoders.  The first was AMD, which provided support for the H.264 L5.1 profile.  I do not know how this is with Nvidia and Intel, so for now I recommend AMD solutions. <br><br>  There is one more innovation - the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H.264">H.264 High 10 Profile (Hi10P) profile</a> .  Hi10P <a href="http://haruhichan.com/wpblog/%3Fp%3D205">presented</a> ( <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/mass_media/129099/">Habr</a> ) as the next step in the development of video compression.  It turned out that if 10-bit signal sampling is used within the codec, then it is possible to ensure a 20-40% (?!) Increase in compression while maintaining quality.  The main plus is an improvement in the transmission of gradients, which can be seen even when outputting to screens with normal color depth (8-bits per channel).  It is known that animeshniki are at the forefront of the use of new video encoding products and now there are groups of releasers that upload videos encoded in this profile.  This profile does not understand most codecs, much less hardware players and DXVA implementations.  Decoding takes place only with soft decoders, which in this case even more heavily load the CPU.  Not all users have top-end processors and this causes public outrage, but it doesn‚Äôt stop release authors, who sometimes don‚Äôt give Hi10P alternatives.  But all this has the character of a local problem in the environment of some anime releases. <br><br>  Note about external H.264 codecs.  Earlier, I tried to use additional external Divx H.264 DXVA and PowerDVD8 H.264 DXVA codecs, now I refused them.  PowerDVD8 H.264 is an old version that does not evolve and has problems when working in Windows 7, and I have repeatedly noticed problems with uneven playback in the new Divx H.264.  In Windows 7, there is a built-in Microsoft H.264 codec with DXVA support, which turned out to be very stable and I have been using it for a long time as a base in Media Player Classic Home Cinema. <br><br>  When choosing a player, I am guided by the following principles: do not litter the system with codecs;  DXVA support;  omnivorous - different containers and codecs;  whenever possible Hi10P support. <br><br><table cellpadding="2"><tbody><tr><td width="111"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/3e4/774/bf2/3e4774bf27f57394c2bcc02e18b1b39b.jpg"></td><td>  <strong><a href="http://www.videolan.org/vlc/">VLC Player</a></strong> <br><br>  pros <br><ul><li>  DXVA support has appeared a long time ago, but beta is still considered, so you need to enable GPU acceleration in options (Tools / Preferences / Input &amp; Codecs / Use GPU acceleration (experimental)). </li><li>  Omnivorous, usually, if something does not go anywhere, it digests. </li></ul><br>  Minuses <br><ul><li>  CPU load in DXVA is 2-3 times more than others, it uses a break in the flow of a standard pipeline in order to apply soft filters. </li><li>  Nontrivial scaling control.
