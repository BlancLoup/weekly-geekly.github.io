It is called Toribash and is essentially a step-by-step fighting game.  This game was casually touched on Habr√©, I will only expand this review a little and, perhaps, draw the attention of those who do not know about it to this game. <br>  If there are people among those reading this post who have played RagDoll Kung-Fu, then we can say that they are a bit similar.  Management is a process of step-by-step assignment of a specific action for each of the joints.  As a result, with proper skill, you can learn how to make very effective techniques.  For starters, here‚Äôs a video with members of the OLDA clan (full game video, not screensavers): <br><iframe width="420" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/FGRAmC1VmZc%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700021,15700186,15700191,15700253,15700256,15700259&amp;usg=ALkJrhhAtAKz29Yu9W418dXitJYkkfezNA" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br>  Have you looked?  Now welcome to the cut (pictures!). <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  In previous reviews of Tori,% usernames% indicated the complexity of the gameplay.  It is hard to argue with this, since the first attempts basically end with a fall in the position of the letter WY. <br>  At the beginning of the game you can get training.  It will show how to change the state of the joints, and teach how to perform individual movements. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/habraeffect/b4/f5/b4f54e4827b17f092a64ca763edb7e18.png" alt="image"><br><br>  At the last stage, there will be a demonstration of several very powerful tricks that can be learned with a great desire.  In general, there are quite a few beautiful replays in the settings, including with the participation of members of OLDA.

    <img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/habraeffect/ac/5b/ac5bcb3c5a501fde097ad8d16994f3b5.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  You can also open a list of mods, the number of which can not be even an approximate calculation. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/habraeffect/5d/0d/5d0d6783ef18da3a5b32f6279f8c4cd6.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Some of them differ only in the addition of swords to their hands, others may represent completely different mini-games, such as racing for survival.  Each of the mods can be customized to your taste by changing the distance between yourself and the opponent or the time of the move. <br>  In general, the game is designed for a multiplayer mode, but for the invention of techniques or their improvement is available single play, in which you can thresh a doll named UKE.  He does not have his own AI, but you can enable it in the settings.  Honestly, I don‚Äôt know why this script is needed, since UKE does not act as a combat doll, but randomly changes the state of several joints.  Well, except to introduce unpredictability in the gameplay. <br>  So, if you learned a couple of tricks and you are burning with the desire to kick everyone's ass, welcome to multiplayer.  Servers for multiplayer games are divided into official and unofficial.  They differ only in that they give Tory credit cards for the first for victories, but not for the latter.  IMHO on the informal should play after you learn to manage your Ragdoll well. <br>  Official servers are broken down according to the belts received by the players.  If you are a beginner, and you do not have a belt, then it is advisable to go to the servers for Beginners, if the belt is slightly higher, then to Intermediate servers and so on.  Within each "belt" group, there are several games that differ in mods.  These are mainly Judo, Aikido and TwinSword.  Sometimes there are others. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/habraeffect/f6/08/f608d462bba7356b81155560cbf246a5.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  The course is given for 15 seconds. <br>  They play on the server in turn: the winner plays with the next in order, and the rest are waiting for their turn.  Mostly turn from 2 to 5 people.  However, it is very interesting to watch other people's fights, therefore, while waiting, one does not have to nervously drum fingers on the table, burning with impatience. <br>  Each match can be saved so that it can be revised in the autumn rainy evening. <br>  For each victory, 10 Tory credit cards are credited to the account.  They are needed to purchase customization for your ragdoll.  You can buy anything from the design for the head and joints, to the texture of the blood and trace your own limbs.  The average cost of each design details from 10,000 and higher Tories credit cards, which hints at donat. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/habraeffect/1f/ca/1fca69ccf8c3ba5aaa29d3b317bf87a0.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  In Torishop, you can buy the possibility of your own design, for which you need to draw your textures, upload it to the server and after a while it is applied to the ragdoll. <br>  Also on the torishop you can see the list of awards and even get a userbar. <br><br><img src="http://cache.toribash.com/usercard/120/111/xojlmc.png?107" alt="image"><br><br>  There are versions of ToriBash for Macs and Linux.  I did not see the version for Mac, so I can‚Äôt say anything, but the Linux version looks much worse.  It may just be flawed, and maybe there are some other reasons. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/b87/8ac/951/b878ac95143b28bb782ce5692fc188a5.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  If about personal experiences, the game is very addictive.  I came up with the first reception only a week after I got acquainted with the game (I can‚Äôt upload the video - the computer is rather weak).  It was very funny when I learned to run, which is quite a challenge.  In general, to know the game is completely unrealistic.  Fortunately, on YouTube you can find many tutorials, but it is much more pleasant to invent something yourself. <br>  It does not bother the game precisely because of its diversity.  Even more enjoyable, this game is completely free, and there are quite a lot of Russian players on the servers.  In general, welcome to the game site <a href="http://www.toribash.com/">www.toribash.com</a> <br>  Have a nice night! <br><img src="http://www.daintyrhino.com/wp_dr/wp-content/uploads/2009/05/screenshottoribash.jpg" alt="image"></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/91336/">https://habr.com/ru/post/91336/</a></p>
