      By scrolling through several forums, I brought out for myself the ways in which, as I was assured, I could be banned. <br><br><ul><li>  ip address  the most banal, of course the first. </li><li>  poppy - address. </li><li>  hwid </li><li>  volume id </li><li>  all sorts of system stuff like username and computer name </li></ul><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/46c/026/232/46c026232ce013104547eb47926174c6.gif" alt="image"><br><br>  Well, about the change of ip, and the little things from the last point, I will not grovel - not the right place.  If anyone does not know, in a nutshell about paragraphs 3 and 4: <br><br><h5>  hwid </h5>  - As I understand it, something like a hardware computer name, for some reason, in many forums there are legends that it is quite difficult to change it. <br><br>  It is hidden in <b>HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE \ Software \ Microsoft \ Cryptography</b> <br>  Tsiferki, you can probably write from the bald, I used the <a href="http://www.famkruithof.net/uuid/uuidgen">generator.</a> <br><br><h5>  VolumeID </h5>  - Serial number of the <b>volume</b> (not to be confused with the hard disk), assigned by the system, changes with a <a href="http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/bb897436">small utility</a> from microsoft. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/914/3e2/2fd/9143e22fd8c850597914e7c7eb9e504f.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Now, then, actually it will be about the most important thing. <br><br><h5>  Replacing the Mac address. </h5><br><br>  It would seem that there is nothing difficult to replace the poppy.  A long time ago, I was shown the NetworkAdress line in the properties of a network card. <br>  Only now I get to the network via a wifi adapter, and there is no way for a vituku to throw it.  In the properties of the adapter <b>NetworkAdress</b> line is just not there. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/b89/84a/f7e/b8984af7e29d0ed9aa592dcdf95c696a.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Let's google  Two programs for poppy substitution come out.  The first is called <a href="http://www.technitium.com/tmac/index.html">TMAC</a> , the second is <a href="http://www.securitylab.ru/software/233802.php">SMAC</a> .  The difference between them is mainly for an <s>amateur</s> man in the street, that one is paid, the second is not. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/12b/8ea/42b/12b8ea42bdc0d3eb217139b4cd941320.png" alt="image"><br><br>  Everything is simple here, the only thing is that the MAC address of the Wi-Fi adapter should look like <br>  XY: XX: XX: XX: XX: XX, where Y = 2, 6, A or E, and X - Any number. <br>  That is, instead of ‚ÄúX‚Äù we substitute absolutely any value of the 16th number system. <br>  ‚ÄúX2: XX: XX: XX: XX: XX‚Äù <br>  ‚ÄúX6: XX: XX: XX: XX: XX‚Äù <br>  ‚ÄúXA: XX: XX: XX: XX: XX‚Äù <br>  ‚ÄúXE: XX: XX: XX: XX: XX‚Äù <br><br>  Google suggested that this is an incomprehensible win7 chip, implemented supposedly in order to protect the Wi-Fi network with MAC address filtering from outside penetration.  As for her, a hidden war against the creation of Gates has been long and persistently conducted on some of the support forums.  I did not understand. <br><br>  In general, we do not care. <br><br>  SMAC refused to replace the poppy on my dlink, TMAC changed everything from the first time, and I had a good shot for a couple of hours. <br><br><h6>  It would seem that. </h6><br>  <i>"... And there was evening and there was morning. Day two."</i> <br><br>  Of course, with any reboot of the computer, reconnecting the adapter, the Mac crashes, and you have to replace it again.  The next day, both softwares categorically refused to replace the address, motivating it with a <s>spring depression</s> , and not motivating with anything. <br><br>  A couple of hours with questions in Google, and a dozen forums in general put me in a dead end.  Quite often there is a strong opinion that it is impossible to replace the poppy with a usb wi-fi adapter, where it is sewn (and it is written on the sticker on the back).  The author writes about this on the TMACa forum himself. <br><br>  At some point it finally dawned on me that most of the similar problems, with the change of poppy, according to the Internet, appear on the seven. <br><br><h5>  How to change Mac on external wi-fi adapter under Win 7. </h5><br>  To do this. <br><br><ul><li>  Install a virtual machine with winXP. </li><li>  Switch the adapter from the host to it, put the driver. </li><li>  Download any of the above softin, change its poppy to any that you want. </li><li>  Switch adapter back to host. </li></ul><br><br>  After these manipulations, the poppy under the 7th will be the same as in the virtual machine. <br><br>  <i>The first post after a long reading.</i> <i><br></i>  <i>I sincerely hope that someone will come in handy.</i> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/141738/">https://habr.com/ru/post/141738/</a></p>
