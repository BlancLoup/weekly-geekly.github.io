Global innovation, but not web 2.0</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  There is an <a href="http://reverseface.com/">idea</a> for a <a href="http://russian.reverseface.com/details-p2.php">patent</a> .  I did not decide whether I want to create a startup for her, but sympathizers are pushing me to it.  The epithet ‚Äúglobal‚Äù says only that it is not just another copy of western technology.  However, it just so happens that many see me as wanting to play the role of a ‚Äúgroundbreaker‚Äù, which sounds very ‚Äúglobally‚Äù and means (at least at an early stage) to be targeted by rotten tomatoes. <br><br> <a href="http://reverseface.com/pda.php"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/olpictures/3ab/823/c87/3ab823c87549231a6ed5868d0e0543eb.png" width="365" height="289" alt="Link to video Reverse keyboard, 3 MB" hspace="10" vspace="10"><br></a> <br><br>  But I didn‚Äôt plan anything global at first.  Just <strong>tired of typing at the table</strong> .  I am a programmer, and a programmer is sometimes difficult to distinguish by external signs from a professional typist (and by ear, from a woodpecker).  Yes, you have to knock a lot on the keys.  But why sitting?  However, you can sit in different ways.  Leaning back in the chair, leg, foot, on the lawn in the park, etc.

    <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  But the free posture is not for those who practice the <strong>10-finger</strong> blind printing method.  I glanced in the direction of the emerging UMPC.  But their two-finger keyboards were deeply disgusted.  Once I wondered what prevents you from making a portable keyboard suitable for typing at professional speed?  And in general, by chance, from nothing, an idea was born. <br><br>  The shape of the UMPC - a flat parallelepiped - is due to the screen.  How do we usually keep such a thing?  With two sides with two hands, thumbs on top.  They are usually trying to make work.  Because the rest of the <strong>fingers are on the bottom side.</strong>  <strong>So why not make buttons where your fingers are?</strong> <br><br>  But there is at least one inconvenience.  Even though I typed it myself, I don't remember all the special characters on a regular desktop keyboard, and even in different layouts.  Moreover, they are not always in the same place with different models of keyboards.  With mobile keyboards, the situation is much worse - from the standard de facto they are even further, and continue to mutate. <br><br>  The idea of <strong>making part of the case transparent</strong> so that not only the buttons were visible, but also the fingers came not immediately, but here I will omit the details.  At the same time, another problem was solved - <strong>how to display only actual characters on the buttons</strong> . <br><br>  This is not new - additional screen.  But it will look different from the keyboard of Artemy Lebedev.  There are either many small small screens inside the buttons (which is expensive and unreliable) or one large one under the buttons.  But the buttons do not make a smooth surface, hence the distortion, especially when viewed at an angle.  I offer the screen above the buttons. <br><br>  Bonus (and it's all salt): when you type, you <strong>see both fingers, buttons, and symbols at the same time</strong> .  For everything that I described above, there are analogues in varying degrees of approximation.  But the combination gives the degree of comfort, which is far from any of the existing solutions. <br><br>  I note that at the very beginning, none of the analogues was known to me.  But this is also a long story.  I came up with my decision from scratch.  And after all over similar decisions institutes, professors, laboratories of large corporations work.  Well, yes, I'm trying to hide behind someone else's authority.  And in you ever thrown rotten tomatoes? <br><br>  Created a <a href="http://reverseface.com/pc.php"><strong>prototype</strong></a> device.  Because no one believed that it could be printed at all.  A <a href="http://reverseface.com/pda.php"><strong>video was</strong></a> made (very short, 3 MB) - this is computer graphics, a 3D model.  For those who can not even imagine the device in their hands.  The creation of the prototype, and especially the video, as well as the mention of the fact that the president of <a href="http://alphagrip.com/">AlphaGrip</a> (she sells the closest analogue) gave a positive review - all this reduced the number of rotten tomatoes by two orders of magnitude.  Occasionally even the wishes of good luck began to appear.  There were no offers to help and participate, as well as answers to my suggestions. <br><br>  The time for obtaining patents in Russia is approaching.  Because of legal incidents, I <strong>have to hurry with patenting abroad.</strong>  <strong>Looking for an investor</strong> in production.  The keyboard is one of the cheapest peripherals.  The cost of a small test batch is minimal.  You can try to sell by the piece on eBay in order to assess the demand. <br><br>  All that I wanted at the very beginning, and even now I would not refuse - a little bit of royalty.  But if the search for an investor is in itself a private enterprise, then I am ready to participate in this process more actively than just as the author of the idea.  <strong>We need partners</strong> in this business.  To find volunteer assistants-enthusiasts - it seems that this is a naive utopia, with which it is time to say goodbye. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/28078/">https://habr.com/ru/post/28078/</a></p>
