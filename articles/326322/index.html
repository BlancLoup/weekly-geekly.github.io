Fascinating about the important</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Psychologist Jed Daymond identified five stages in the development of love: love, rapprochement, disappointment, overcoming the crisis and building strong, constructive relationships. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/3ac/407/35d/3ac40735d5104faf908e04c9a2fddadf.png"></div><br>  It is very similar to how CRM is usually introduced, we thought.  You remembered that in the comments to our previous review you asked when to wait for ‚Äúcats on the main one‚Äù.  And they decided that so be it.  Let there be a post about CRM, love and seals.  But already on the main one or not - it's up to our readers :) <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h1>  Foreword </h1><br>  The history of the introduction of CRM-systems are very dramatic.  With his passions, failures and little tragedies.  That is why, at first, we wanted to compare this process with the five stages of accepting the inevitable (based on the theory of Elizabeth K√ºbler-Ross).  But then a positive vision of the situation took over.  Ultimately, automating and optimizing a company's work is a creative force, not a disease or death.  Libido, not mortido. <br><br>  So, building relationships with a CRM system is like a love story.  "All the happy ones are alike (well, almost!), Each unhappy one is unhappy in its own way."

      Everything does not always go smoothly, relationships require work, as psychologists like to say, but the end, in theory, should be happy.  Each such introduction is unique and unique, as is the history of the development of human relationships.  And although there are no similar stories - there are certain rules, canons, according to which these relations usually develop. <br><br><h2>  The first stage - love </h2><br><pre><code class="objectivec hljs">¬´    .    ¬ª</code> </pre> <br><blockquote>  Being in love is the time of the projection of all your desires and hopes for your partner, when not the mind speaks in you, but the hormones endorphin and oxytocin.  A partner is seen as a perfect creation without a single flaw.  You think that he will always fulfill your every desire, believe in every word he says and dream of eternal love, rejecting any valid skepticism. </blockquote><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/57b/80d/81b/57b80d81bf8c4a73826c694742a2e3d2.jpg"></div><br>  <b>This story can begin, for example, like this:</b> <br><br>  ‚ÄúThe company B. has been doing business on building materials since 1998.  The management set goals, and the employees achieved them: made mistakes, achieved success.  Since its foundation, the state has grown from two to fifty-three people, each one individually understood dozens of questions, implemented personal projects.  At the same time, from time to time, one drawback was manifested - the chaotic fermentation of an enlarged, but not structured collective.  It seems that field workers, too, seem to have clear responsibilities, fixed by job descriptions ... But even certain joint tasks became uncontrolled and sometimes forgotten.  What to say about projects where hundreds of interrelated tasks were required to be solved. <br><br>  And here Anatoly Efremovich, the owner of the company, heard from the deputy commerce director about a certain management system, let it be SingleBasket, which he became interested in.  In the title there were incomprehensible abbreviations CRM + ERP + BPM, but an advanced employee explained them: <br><br>  <b>CRM</b> - customer relationship management; <br>  <b>ERP</b> - enterprise resource management; <br>  <b>BPM</b> - company workflow management. <br><br>  He eloquently described the potential for business structuring, explained the way to improve financial performance.  Fascinated by the prospect, Anatoly Yefremovich makes a strategic decision to radically change the life of his enterprise. ‚Äù <br><br><hr><br>  It does not matter how they learn about each other for the first time.  Most often, indeed, it is the manager, the owner or the investor of the client‚Äôs company who decides that ‚Äúnow we will do it - and we will immediately heal!‚Äù <br><br>  <i>"We will live and sing in a new way"</i> <br><br>  What is important is not the first acquaintance, but what will happen next.  Being in love, as you know, deprives a certain amount of critical thinking.  The charm of the new object of desire overshadows the mind and makes it impossible to estimate the size of future happiness or future disasters, to plan the future. <br><br>  At this stage, the client can make some lovely mistakes peculiar to lovers: <br><br>  <b>1) "He is the best, mom" or "Here we install CRM - and immediately increase our profits by 300%, and sales by 200%."</b> <br><br>  Do not overestimate your "partner" or endow the qualities of a fairytale hero. <br><br>  CRM is a tool to systematize data, automate routine operations, coordinate the work of employees, easily identify customers and the history of communication with them, optimize company processes. <br><br>  This tool will increase profits and sales only if it is properly selected and debugged. <br><br><br>  <b>2) ‚ÄúHow can he not like it?‚Äù Or a delusion that all employees will gladly accept the transition to CRM.</b> <br><br>  In fact, you need to be prepared for the fact that company employees will protest or ignore the new system - for various reasons. <br><br>  Even the most active are accustomed to work in their own style and pace.  Stereotypes of adults break down difficult.  Often, sales managers oppose the introduction of CRM simply because they ‚Äúalready keep their customers' table in Excel and it‚Äôs more convenient for them‚Äù.  As for the lazy, in principle, a transparent system is not profitable for them, because then it will be more difficult to play ‚ÄúFarm Frenzy‚Äù or post photos of cats (again they!) On Facebook in the breaks between official business. <br><br><br>  <b>3) "If all my relatives are not happy with her, then blame yourself ..."</b> <br>  Quarrel with the family because of the love object will be a mistake.  In this case, the family can safely be considered the company's team. <br><br>  For effective implementation of CRM, well-coordinated work of all participants in the process is necessary.  Therefore, from the first days of the staff it is necessary to motivate, to convince of the need for a new system of work.  Immediately cost to appoint responsible for the implementation.  The person who will control that all employees start using CRM. <br><br><br>  <b>4) "Maybe you will wait, and maybe not - it's your business ..."</b> <br>  Insufficient attention to the object of love.  When the manager is removed from the selection, planning and active implementation of CRM. <br><br>  But he is the one who best knows the whole kitchen and all business processes.  Despite the appointment of a CRM supervisor, the boss should pay attention to implementation at all its stages, motivating and inspiring employees with his example. <br><br><br>  <b>5) The fact that the people called "tell a demo version."</b> <br>  Deciding that the system is so good that the free version or demo version will solve all the problems of the company. <br><br>  There are cases when the free version can satisfy the lover, that is, the buyer.  But usually, as it happens with all demo versions, it works only at the initial stage.  As business grows, the need to expand and deepen grows.  Therefore, the budget for the implementation of CRM should be thought out already at this first stage.  And on it you need to determine whether the vendor is suitable for you, its conditions and support. <br><br><br>  <b>6) "In love - as in the pool, with the head."</b> <br>  In practice, this desire, "not zadurayas" analysis of the situation in the company, "quickly" to install CRM.  And then everything will go by itself - how it will go. <br><br>  Such an approach and in love will lead to the fact that it will be a little painful.  What to say about business. <br><br>  We advise our clients to start automation with such simple actions: <br><br>  a) Clearly, preferably in numbers, state the purpose of implementing CRM. <br><br>  You can use both quantitative indicators and temporary.  Do not write a lot.  Enough of the most important thing.  If you can not express the goal in numbers - you can not reach it. <br><br>  Making work more convenient is not a goal, but a Wishlist.  Reduce the adoption of a new order to 1 minute - this is the real goal. <br><br>  b) Make a list of factors that will fundamentally affect the achievement of this goal. <br><br>  c) Write a mini implementation plan. <br><br>  Your plan must comply with the rules: <br><br>  - gradually; <br>  - continuously; <br>  - increasingly. <br><br>  The only way!  Do not run to buy a diamond ring, if earlier you met girls only on programming pairs.  We need experience of meetings, communication, quarrels and reconciliations.  The ‚Äúbreaking off‚Äù emotion is the worst poison in slow motion. <br><br>  d) We do not discourage you from being in love.  Be it!  Be in love - and do not try to provide ALL the subtleties in your plan.  Because it is impossible to do this.  No one has yet succeeded.  You always do not foresee something and this is normal.  Do not be afraid.  Final understanding comes only with practice. <br><br>  And another mistake would be to delay the transition to the next stage.  Take action.  Just do it. <br><br><h2>  The second stage - the official beginning of the relationship </h2><br><pre> <code class="objectivec hljs">¬´         ¬ª</code> </pre> <br><blockquote>  Love becomes stronger, and the date replaces the official co-residence.  You get to know each other much closer, you begin to influence all aspects of your partner‚Äôs life.  A time of unity and joy.  You feel protected, desired.  And you believe that you have precisely found your own person, that this, as they say, is fate, and that you will never doubt this.  Probably the appearance of children, which can be a real test for the young couple. </blockquote><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/162/137/8c4/1621378c466d4bd395575e907110b711.jpg"></div><br>  <s>Fasting photos from the wedding</s> . Joyful press releases are sent about the modernization of the company.  And at this time it would be necessary to think through the "marriage contract." <br><br>  The value of automation for business is difficult to overestimate.  This is the preparation of a platform for further growth, productivity growth and the work of the company's team.  The project for the implementation of CRM, ERP, BPM should be well organized and thought out. <br><br>  Nothing strengthens a marriage like a marriage contract.  The same applies to the introduction of automation in the company.  Creating an automation plan requires the participation of both parties - the client company and the vendor. <br><br>  <b>We (Webproduction) do this:</b> <br><br>  1) At this stage we have already received from the client a general plan - his vision of the project (his goals and ideas for their achievement); <br><br>  2) Next, we create an implementation document. <br><br>  This document becomes the main at this stage.  His goal is to describe as a whole and at the same time, in some detail, the changes that need to be achieved. <br><br>  This is a serious preparatory stage in which both parties: <br><br><ul><li>  verify their understanding of the upcoming implementation; </li><li>  determine the optimal control scheme in the company's system; </li><li>  identify bottlenecks and optimize the business process diagram. </li></ul><br>  3) Our employee is the best man at the wedding - an instructor who ‚Äúthrough the hands and hearts of the client‚Äù ensures the implementation of the system. <br><br>  4) We select the first block and start with it. <br><br>  It must meet the requirements: it is important, useful, you can do quickly. <br><br>  <b>Here is a very common mistake</b> - the desire to immediately get all the delights of family life.  Do not just marry, but immediately and more kids give birth.  And the engagement, and the wedding, and name day with the christening to the heap. <br><br>  And in our case, such a strategic blunder is the introduction of CRM in all directions and divisions at once, only all at once, here and now.  Or good - or nothing. <br><br>  But it is good only if gradually, thoughtfully and leisurely. <br><br>  Of course, modern CRM-systems have long overgrown the boundaries of sales departments: they cover the work of marketing services, accounting and legal issues and coordination, warehouse, logistics, HR-department, production management and support services.  And they are usually called harder - in one word of three letters you will not get along. <br><br>  This, of course, is a certain ideal - a complete integrated automated eco-system of the company.  This is the summit to which we must strive, both in marriage and in work.  But so simple and immediately this peak does not submit. <br><br>  Therefore, gradualness is important.  "Nomeraka", as the Japanese say, denoting a smooth but steady movement katana. <br><br>  The definition of the current goal - the collection of information - plan - testing - training - data transfer / start of operation.  First in one block.  Then the analysis, finding errors and bottlenecks.  Further planning, moving to the next block.  This is similar to the complex treatment of the body of the company.  Thoughtful and without shock therapy. <br><br>  To ensure that the implementation proceeds as smoothly as possible, the vendor and the client determine the starting point for operation.  For example, the point could be the day when employees start sending letters and calling only through CRM.  This is the easiest option - and easily achievable.  Once this point is passed - you can move on to the next.  The introduction of new and new features of CRM should occur in stages, to make it easier for employees to learn and get used to the product. <br><br>  Begins the inevitable "grinding in marriage." <br><br><h2>  The third stage - disappointment </h2><br><pre> <code class="objectivec hljs">¬´    ¬ª</code> </pre> <br><blockquote>  The first difficulties turning into the collapse of naive hopes for unlimited happiness.  This is the stage when there is a feeling that the feelings are irretrievably extinguished.  The behavior of the partner begins to annoy.  I want to take a break in the relationship.  Or even recognize that it was not your man.  Why so torture yourself and the one with whom it was once good ... </blockquote><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/aaf/97f/110/aaf97f110fb14fee855223e361293960.jpg"></div><br>  Why is disappointment happening? <br><br>  Because we are confronted with difficulties or problems that we did not expect in relations with ‚Äúthis ideal creation‚Äù: <br><br>  <b>1. Quarrels and misunderstandings between your partner and your relatives.</b> <br>  "Whoever she is, she no longer likes me, son."  The reverse is also true - remember jokes about the mother-in-law and the eternal female crying about the mother-in-law. <br><br>  In the context of CRM, this is the rejection by your employees of the new work system.  And sometimes just ignoring or even outright sabotage. <br><br>  According to the experience, those who do not finish things in the workplace, work mediocrely, or have a personal benefit from the fact that there are no strict control tools resist most actively introducing CRM. <br><br>  In such cases, the company may come up with its own rules to encourage the use of CRM.  For example, allow not to perform those tasks that are not in the system, even if they were set by the CEO himself over a cup of coffee.  Not introduced the task - you can ignore.  Or there is no transaction in CRM - there is no payment for it.  Of course, this is extreme measures and it would be good not to bring them to them.  To think over the system of motivation of employees, methods of its implementation and control is an important task of the boss. <br><br>  <b>2. The inability of partners to agree on the division of responsibilities.</b> <br>  "I'm here as a woman, not as a thermometer" <br><br>  Each team member must understand the measure of their participation and responsibility in the new system.  Employees need time to get used to the system, get used to it, adapt to the desired mode.  The manager is very important to treat with understanding the fact that lapping is necessary.  Claims and squabbles destroy any marriage.  Total control and mass repression for the fact that someone can not cope with the CRM, will not bring benefits. <br><br>  However, ignoring the inaction of their subordinates is also not worth it.  It requires training, motivation (we have already talked about this above) and the assistance of the person responsible for implementing CRM, the manager and the vendor.  It is always better not just to demand, but to explain what you want and why.  Employees need to understand the structure, logic, communication and the mechanism of CRM.  For this, primary training from a vendor is important. <br><br>  <b>3. ‚ÄúLearn, learn and study again‚Äù</b> <br>  The art of love, or rather the ability to love in a marriage, must be tirelessly learned, although this is not taught in schools and universities. <br><br>  In the case of CRM, everything is simpler - employees need to be trained to work with it, and the vendor will help in this. <br><br>  Without comprehensive training of employees, the implementation of CRM will remain inept poking and weeping a novice in an unsuccessful search for "point G". <br>  In addition to initial training, there should be an improvement in the love of CRM skills within the company itself. <br><br>  Here will help and sex toys (the use of additional features CRM in daily work), and role-playing games (building healthy competition between employees by aggregating data on their work and posting indicators for public viewing).  In general, there is a place where the vicious fantasy of the leader turns around (it is important not to bend the stick and turn the playing whip with the pink pompomchik into a banal and unpleasant whip, the scourge of the driver). <br><br>  The more various CRM features and capabilities are integrated into the normal course of work of an employee, the faster and fuller his training will be. <br><br>  This, of course, will cause protests ... But it is hard to learn - it is easy in battle.  And without a fight, new market segments cannot be mastered and a piece of opportunistic pie cannot be won back from competitors. <br><br>  <b>4. "Oh, everything!"</b> <br>  Some moments in the distribution of rights and obligations in the family is simply impossible to take into account even in the marriage contract.  And plus to this is a growing distrust between partners. <br><br>  Who will do the dishes?  Why not the one who cooks?  Well, if not the one.  But why then, if one cooks, and one does the dishes - then there is three times more dishes after dinner than when the same person cooks and washes? <br><br>  Conflict of interests in different departments of the company can cause a serious problem with the implementation of CRM.  In theory, all employees should have one goal: increasing the company's profit and profitability.  But often personal and group aspirations contradict corporate.  Under these conditions, due to the difference in the goals of different departments, some of the information may be ‚Äúlost‚Äù, delayed or withheld.  In financial companies, for example, this often happens between the trading department and the back office. <br><br>  In the case of dishes, the problem is solved by buying a dishwasher. <br><br>  In a corporate conflict, the disadvantages of CRM functioning can be eliminated by using its advantages.  All data on the work of the company should be gradually centralized and accessible to all employees who need this information to make a decision.  Comprehensive, universal CRM (the ones that CRM + ERP + BPM) help to cope with this task.  Such systems provide full automation of all information flows of the company. <br><br>  Note the important.  Here we do not consider the need to build a ‚ÄúChinese wall‚Äù between departments.  This may require the interests of the client, the safety of insider information or a market regulator.  These are particular cases occurring, for example, in large financial companies between investment and brokerage divisions.  Here, of course, the approach is quite different.  Sometimes the husband cannot tell his wife what he did at work, but this is not a distrust, and everyone understands everything. <br><br>  <b>5. Errors made in the past stages.</b> <br>  ‚ÄúWell, I was such a fool!  After all, I saw it!  But she hoped she would resolve herself. ‚Äù <br><br>  Here, and correct data entry, and the lack of backups and consistency in the database, and ill-conceived integration with other systems, and storing different data <s>eggs</s> in different baskets, and the delayed introduction of operational information into the company system. <br><br>  A psychotherapist (a vendor who can order business process audits ‚Äî for example, Webproduction has <a href="https://webproduction.ua/blog/crm-audit">such a service</a> ) or a wise close person can help in resolving family conflicts (Remember the employee we chose to be responsible for implementation? Yes, it is!) . <br><br>  The employee responsible for implementation can become both the internal auditor of the thin spots in the CRM work, and the coach for the rest of the team, and the performance monitor of other employees.  He can contact the vendor, study on his own and then train the rest of the team, ensure that everyone understands and uses CRM, collect feedback and resolve emerging issues and inconsistencies with the CRM supplier company. <br><br>  Anyway, the crisis is resolved together. <br><br><h2>   ‚Äì        </h2><br><pre> <code class="objectivec hljs">¬´    ‚Äì   ,     ¬ª</code> </pre> <br><blockquote>   ,        :       ,      .     ,         ,     .         .            . </blockquote><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/e4d/379/f4f/e4d379f4feb94fa6b14e7ccac38d4127.jpg"></div><br>   ,         ¬´  ¬ª,   ‚Äì ¬´     ¬ª. <br><br> ,  CRM    ,   ,  ,   ,          . <br><br>  ,   .        .         10  -,  -         (  , ). <br><br> ,     CRM     .        ,       ,       . ,      .   ¬´¬ª    CRM-. <br><br> <b>       .</b> <br><br>     CRM   ,  ,             .      ,   . ,        - ,       , ,  ¬´¬ª    -,  ,         . <br><br>    CRM,                 ,        . <br><br>      ,  ¬´ ¬ª CRM ¬´ ¬ª            -  .        :       CRM,          .         . <br><br> ,             ,      ,    ,        ,       (  ),         KPI.  ,                . :)  -   .    .             .
