National Public Radio, the largest state radio station in the United States, went even further: it aired a <a href="http://www.npr.org/blogs/alltechconsidered/2013/09/30/226835934/your-digital-trail-and-how-it-can-be-used-against-you">story about</a> these two practices almost interchangeable, and the New York Times referred to the collection of personal information collected by the United States National Security Agency (NSA), as if by accident. in the text of an <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/10/06/technology/selling-secrets-of-phone-users-to-advertisers.html%3Fpagewanted%3Dall%26_r%3D2%26">article about advertisers</a> using mobile call data.

      To confuse in the minds of readers two such different types of data is at least irresponsible.  The government collects information regardless of the wishes of its owners.  It can climb into every corner of our lives: <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/jul/31/nsa-top-secret-program-online-data">from mobile calls to chat messages</a> and search queries, and will find many pretexts to bypass the rules.  But online advertising, to get your data, requires permission from at least one of the parties to the process - either a consumer or a publisher site.  In addition, the European Union must notify consumers that their <a href="http://www.ico.org.uk/for_organisations/privacy_and_electronic_communications/the_guide/cookies">data has become available to advertisers</a> .  Stories that identify government and digital marketers will hinder innovation, not only make advertising less relevant and <a href="http://www.aef.com/industry/news/data/2013/1318/:pf_printable">content creation less profitable</a> , but also scare people away from participating in online <a href="http://www.mckinsey.com/insights/health_systems_and_services/the_big-data_revolution_in_us_health_care">health</a> , education and <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/198752/13-744-shakespeare-review-of-public-sector-information.pdf">transport services (pdf)</a> if they request personal data.  These capabilities are based on the trust of users of new products that require the exchange of personal information. <br><br>  To understand how big the difference is between data collection for online advertising and government intelligence, look at the methods for obtaining and using them.  If the United States government wants information about you, it will either use technology like PRISM or use the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act to force companies to transmit data and prevent them from informing you about the leak.  In some cases, the information goes to <a href="http://uk.reuters.com/article/2013/08/07/uk-dea-irs-idUKBRE9761B620130807">the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) and the Tax Service (IRS)</a> , from where it is transmitted to local law enforcement agencies, where it can be used as long as necessary to <a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2013/08/dea-and-nsa-team-intelligence-laundering">come up with a story</a> that will cause your arrest. and hush up the true data source.  The New York Times reports that this data is used to combat anything <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/08/04/us/other-agencies-clamor-for-data-nsa-compiles.html%3F_r%3D1%26">from cigarette propaganda to copyright infringement</a> - although such incidents rarely threaten national security. <br><br>  As a rule, in the advertising business data is collected in order to sell the maximum amount of goods, spending a minimum of resources on marketing.  The data used includes a list of search queries, web pages you have opened, things that you have viewed in online stores, and more recently information about what you bought.  In the West there is a <a href="http://www.networkadvertising.org/code-enforcement/code">strict regulation</a> that requires the refusal of personal information and prohibits the use of any data for making decisions, for example, about the amount of insurance payments to the user.  The success of advertising based on managing large amounts of data is determined by the reduction of the cost of its placement, and the consumer eventually sees more relevant advertising. <br><br>  To say that the government can use information from advertisers to spy is a clear exaggeration. <br>  The NSA collects data about users' actions <a href="http://www.wired.com/threatlevel/2013/06/nsa-whistleblower-klein/">from several sources</a> , and they are much more personalized than those used for advertising targeting - so the existence of a behavioral aspect in the advertising industry does not in the least facilitate the collection of information for the NSA. <br><br>  The editorial board of the New York Times tried to construct a situation in which it would be necessary to regulate behavioral advertising, and came up with a hypothetical scenario of how the <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/10/10/opinion/monitoring-your-every-move.html%3Fpartner%3Drssnyt%26emc%3Drss%26_r%3D1%26">data collected for advertising can harm</a> : for example, information is stored in personal profiles, and access to it at any time can require government agencies.  Or they can be bought by employers or banks to evaluate candidates for employment and credit. <br><br>  However, this hypothesis is unfounded.  The US <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fair_Credit_Reporting_Act">Fair Credit Reporting Act</a> requires a high degree of transparency in any data used to make financial reliability decisions.  The government does not need data collected by advertising, because the <a href="http://www.wired.com/threatlevel/2013/06/nsa-whistleblower-klein/">NSA data is</a> obviously more accurate than those used for targeting.  A recent <a href="http://swampland.time.com/2013/10/14/nsa-collects-online-address-books-and-buddy-lists/">report from Time magazine</a> says that the NSA will get a little less than 500,000 address books a day.  Obviously, the existence of the behavioral advertising industry is not able to further simplify the collection of information for the NSA. <br><br>  In fairness, we note that there are examples of questionable use of marketing data.  Last year, the Wall Street Journal recorded several cases in which cookies were used as a <a href="http://online.wsj.com/news/articles/SB10001424127887323777204578189391813881534">tool to change pricing</a> : customers were offered different prices depending on their proximity to competitors' stores.  Also talked about the cases of increasing airline fares after repeated search requests.  But even this is not the most painful;  the feeling ‚Äúsomeone is following me‚Äù depresses much more. <br><br>  But massive attacks on behavioral advertising undermine online models without confirming the key assumption: are consumers really worried about using data for advertising if they truly understand how to manage their information?  To find out, we turned to Enliken research: according to its results, <a href="http://enliken.com/discover/">less than 10% of users are</a> concerned about the use of their data for marketing purposes.  Acxiom analysts came up with the same result when they opened their databases to the public a couple of weeks ago.  Studies from <a href="http://www.pwc.com/us/en/industry/entertainment-media/assets/pwc-consumer-privacy-and-information-sharing.pdf">PricewaterhouseCoopers (pdf)</a> , <a href="http://www.dma.org.uk/news/brands-making-progress-winning-hearts-and-data%3Futm_source%3Ddigitalfire%26utm_medium%3Dblog%26utm_campaign%3Dyoure_welcome">DMA,</a> <a href="http://truthcentral.mccann.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/McCann_Truth_about_Privacy.pdf">McCann (pdf)</a> support the idea that consumers want to share information with brands they trust. <br><br>  Therefore, all types of online businesses are interested in transparency and regulation of the processes of working with private data.  Knowledge of the preferences of a particular consumer can raise services to a fundamentally different level.  It would be a shame to lose all the opportunities that open up to people, because of the banal confusion of concepts.  Let's separate the flies from cutlets. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/201076/">https://habr.com/ru/post/201076/</a></p>
