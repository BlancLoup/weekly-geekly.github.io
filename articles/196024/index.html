For the first time, the full version of the book "The Theory of Universal Contact" by the famous Soviet and Russian artist, teacher and philosopher Eli Belyutin (1925-2012) is published. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/3c0/58c/ab3/3c058cab3e8a714033bd699a40773f77.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  It was his paintings that became the object of attacks by General Secretary Khrushchev at the memorable exhibition of the Soviet avant-garde in the Arena in 1962.  ‚ÄúYou asshole Comrade Belyutin!‚Äù The Soviet leader shouted.

One of his most significant works was the theory of universal contact, in which he proposes his own method of creating creative thinking, both in abstract art and in other, different directions. <br><br>  <b>Create creative</b> <br><br>  The theory of universal contact is based on the fact that art is the most vivid form of manifestation of human creative abilities.  Only the drawing process makes it possible to make the course of human thought visible to all.  Visualization of various ideas allows you to visualize their elements, to establish completely unexpected connections between them.  The method of Belutin allows you to activate inactive and weakly affected areas of the brain. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/4f6/fe2/3ec/4f6fe23ecd9c44cabe2c9bf28417ecc1.jpg" alt="image"><br>  <i>Painting from the master class of MISiS students according to the method of Belutin (April 2013).</i>  <i>Many of its members never drew.</i> <br><br>  On the basis of this theory, an entire school of the development of human creative abilities ‚ÄúNew Reality‚Äù was formed.  Belutin's technique allowed his students at the subconscious level to generate creative ideas, embodied both in the created drawings, and in non-standard and effective solutions in other areas.  It is known that the application of the theory of universal contact in the visual arts gave rise to more than 20 new world trends.  Based on it, many well-known foreign practices are built. <br>  It is clear that after the demolition of the Manege exhibition by bulldozers, Belutin had no chance to publish his work in Russia.  On the Internet there are only separate drafts and excerpts from it.  Another samizdat book exists only in print. <br>  The publication, which is expected this week, was the result of the enormous work of the widow Belutin Nina Moleva.  In it, finally, it was possible to combine the fragments scattered around the world into a single form. <br><br>  <b>Our work was stolen by the Americans?</b> <b><br></b> <br>  In the most complete version in the second half of the last century, the work of Belyutin was published in Italy and the United States.  It can be assumed that the theory of universal contact became the main so-called ‚ÄúProject Zero‚Äù, one of the largest projects in the world for the development of human creative thinking, which began in the 60s of the last century at Harvard University.  The main provisions of the Russian and American projects are very similar.  The theory behind Project Zero is called The Theory of Multiple Intelligences.  Its author is one of the most famous American thinkers in the field of education, Howard Gadrner.  Project Zero is supported by the US government and many private companies. <br><br>  <b>Methods of creating creativity in the world</b> <br><br>  In general, the subject of creating creative thinking in the world today began to pay great attention.  In the USA and Canada, almost all leading universities have courses in this subject.  And they are funded by many famous brands (such as Visa, Pepsico, etc.).  And two years ago, China, at one of the CPC plenums, included the development of the nation‚Äôs creativity in the number of strategic tasks. <br>  Domestic projects for the development of creativity open and large companies.  This is Google and Apple.  For example, Hyundai recently launched the My Baby: Discover 2050 project. This is an intra-corporate design competition aimed at developing creative thinking and, as a result, at creating unusual cars of the future. <br><br>  <b>Belutin project is being revived in Russia</b> <br><br>  This year in Russia, the theory of universal contact became a second wind.  On the basis of NITU "MISIS" the project "New Reality 2.0" was opened.  The main initiator of the project was the famous entrepreneur Olga Uskova (who is also the head of the department of engineering cybernetics), as well as a number of students and followers of Eliya Belutin.  Famous companies have joined the project: Bank of Moscow, Cognitive Technologies, PriceWaterhouseCoopers and others.  As well as famous figures of culture, science and art.  The meaning of the project was to popularize the development of Belutin‚Äôs creative thinking in our country.  It‚Äôs too early to talk about the results, but we can already say for sure that every year more and more people are interested in it.  For example, when such a master class took place in July at the MISiS site on Seliger, it started to rain, a storm began, a warning was announced on the radio about gathering in a safe place, but none of the guys left.  Drawn in the rain!  And no one wanted to leave.  I personally know girls who, no matter what, continued to draw.  What was happening was interesting and exciting.  People gathered around artists and asked where they could get canvas and paints.  With all the atmosphere and the weather people got wonderful pictures.  This is really important. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/00d/dde/ec6/00dddeec6e1862c16e9b6b7f3bd6434d.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/b47/ff5/d98/b47ff5d9833e828da8c369327173044a.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/74c/ec0/f93/74cec0f93708624c1baabfca59434ff6.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/3f6/fb7/9c3/3f6fb79c3895310c3e68d2c93d8db7c8.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/36f/0ef/bb6/36f0efbb60c02d85edfde72d8bb07029.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  By the way, some of the work performed at our master classes were estimated by experts at hundreds of thousands of rubles. <br><habracut></habracut></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/196024/">https://habr.com/ru/post/196024/</a></p>
