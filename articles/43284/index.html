Responsibilities </h1><br>  It seems to me convenient enough that the list of duties of each employee consisted of 7 to 9 main duties (and the lists of duties of all employees must include self-development, and for managers in this list was personnel management).  After reaching an understanding regarding this short concise list between the leader and the subordinate, it makes sense to create a more detailed job description. <br><br>  For example, the duties of the production manager: 
      <br>
        <script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>
        <ins class="adsbygoogle"
          style="display:block; text-align:center;"
          data-ad-layout="in-article"
          data-ad-format="fluid"
          data-ad-client="ca-pub-6974184241884155"
          data-ad-slot="8945601208"></ins>
        <script>
          (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
        </script>
      <br>
      1) the volume of production <br><br>  2) schedule <br><br>  3) costs <br><br>  4) management of subordinates <br><br>  5) safety technology <br><br>  6) quality, <br><br>  7) order in the production premises <br><br>  8) self-improvement. <br><br>  This allows you to concentrate on the main thing, not to lose the essence of the job for a long-term job description. <br><br>  Moreover, not only the manager should have a clear vision of the work of the subordinate, but the employee should also be no less clear about what is expected of him.  As in the management, aimed at the result, this is a very important point (not only when creating a list of responsibilities, but in further stages of work), a little more detail about this. <br><br>  How to transfer managerial impact? <br><br>  In which cases assume that your management will achieve the result? <br><br>  During the competition in our School of Personnel Managers we included the following question in the professional test: <br><br>  ‚ÄúWhat kind of authority is the HR manager given?‚Äù <br><br>  offering as answer options: <br><ul><li>  the rule of law </li><li>  power of encouragement </li><li>  power of punishment </li><li>  expert power </li><li>  power of example </li><li>  and the power of persuasion. </li></ul><br>  Then, at a meeting with the candidates, a discussion on this issue flared up.  So, it is clear that the personnel manager has only the last three types of authority.  And, despite the fact that the first head of the company in the arsenal of means of influencing subordinates and the first three too, I am convinced that it is the latter that are most effective, and if my thought is completely concentrated, then the last kind of power is the power of persuasion.  I believe that if, in response to your managerial influence, you, as a manager, did not receive in one form or another, ‚Äúunderstand and accept‚Äù, then you can not indulge yourself with the illusions that you have achieved something. <br><br>  Those.  without real feedback from the subordinate that the duties are fully understood and accepted for execution (for example, having transmitted instructions through the personnel employee and even having received the sacramental signature ‚ÄúI am aware and undertake to fulfill‚Äù under it, but without discussing the list of duties), one can not expect quality their implementation. <br><br><h1>  2. Goals </h1><br>  A goal is an end result that must be achieved as a result of performing these duties within a certain time.  The goal is not a description of the activity.  To formulate a goal, it is useful to use the following formula: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/b36/fb4/753/b36fb475335145d48921f952033fadf5.jpg"><br><br>  In my opinion, no more than 5 - 7 goals should be formulated.  The goal is set based on a list of responsibilities.  For example, the responsibilities of production manager ‚Äúcosts‚Äù can meet the following goal: ‚ÄúI will reduce the level of fixed costs from 300 thousand per month in June to 280 thousand per month by December 31 of this year.‚Äù <br><br><h1>  3. Plans </h1><br>  A plan is a list of steps you need to take to achieve a goal. <br><br>  If the previous stage is always discussed by the employee with the supervisor, then the plan can be discussed or not discussed with the supervisor depending on the employee‚Äôs experience or his qualifications.  Plans can be short-term or long-term, simple or detailed.  Most importantly, it must be executable and contain checkpoints. <br><br><h1>  4. Reports </h1><br>  Ideally, the employee first makes a self-assessment of what has been achieved, and then submits a report to the supervisor.  The frequency of report preparation depends on the type of work and the situation.  The report itself only serves as a basis for discussing the effectiveness of the entire work. <br><br>  The results of the work can always be divided into three categories: <br><br>  1) meets expectations <br><br>  2) below expectations <br><br>  3) above expectations. <br><br><h1>  5. Remuneration </h1><br>  Remuneration and work results can be related as follows: <br><br>  1) When the results of the work are in line with expectations, the employee can expect payment of the bonus. <br><br>  2) When results are lower than expected, the employee should not rely on a bonus. <br><br>  3) When results exceed expectations, the employee can expect to receive a pay raise and a bonus. <br><br>  The main difficulties I encounter in the implementation of management, aimed at the result: <br><ul><li>  The amorphousness of the vision of the functional field of each employee by managers. </li><li>  Inability to convey clearly, accessible, with feedback from the leaders of the list of responsibilities to the performers. </li><li>  Inability to set a countable target.  As a rule, the goal looks like in that fairy tale: go there, I don‚Äôt know where, bring it, I don‚Äôt know what. </li><li>  The inability of many workers to plan.  For almost a year in our Agency, we have developed and are implementing a planning system.  But from week to week I see enormous difficulties in this matter, even for, in general, advanced in self-management of workers.  Endless ‚Äúwhy this is necessary, I will do everything, it‚Äôs difficult to foresee everything‚Äù, etc. </li><li>  Huge difficulties with introspection and reporting.  For example: recently we turned to one of the companies for which we are fulfilling orders for recruitment, asking the personnel manager of this company to do an analysis of our work for us so that we can improve it.  We waited for a very long time, and the analysts we needed were never seen.  Of course it is difficult.  And very many managers in every possible way leave from the analysis and reports.  It reminds me a lot of the well-known anecdote ‚Äúwhat to think, shaking is necessary‚Äù. </li></ul><br>  And most importantly, the general mood: ‚ÄúIn Russia, such a changeable external environment that any formalization, description of duties, planning, etc., i.e.  all calculus is doomed to failure.  There is no need to deal with garbage, we must work. ‚Äù <br><br>  Well, what's the answer? <br>  But I‚Äôll repeat it again: IF YOU DON'T MEASURE THAT, THEN DO NOT CONTROL !!! <br><br>  ¬© Elena Raud, <a href="http://rezultat.com/">Result</a> magazine ‚Ññ1, 2003 <br>  <a href="http://fazzz.ru/how-to-manage-human-resources-in-the-fast-changing-world/">See in English</a> . </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/43284/">https://habr.com/ru/post/43284/</a></p>
