The Problem of Artificial Intelligence</b> <br><br>  Perspective, the creation of artificial intelligence excites the imagination.  The humanoid robot is drawn to the man in the mind, and he (the man in the street) thinks: the robot will be ‚Äúsmarter‚Äù than the human being necessarily aggressive.  The researcher has plans for powerful systems with separate advanced elements of the intellect.  Both have a common image of artificial superintellekt, as a global network system like Skynet - extremely smart and therefore also necessarily aggressive. <br><br>  It is well known that if something needs to be done, then it is necessary to have at least a definition.  problem statement for the target product.  There is no definition yet - it is not known what to do.  Therefore, practical researchers concentrate on what is called weak artificial intelligence or elements of the intellect, and significant progress is made in this: machine vision, dialogue systems, etc., with the development of hardware platforms, their solutions work better and better.

      But if you still ask the question: what is intelligence in general? <br><br>  The existing definitions of intelligence have limited constructiveness, rather, they are, as they say, have a descriptive or descriptive character, and they are also very blurred. <br><br>  This is what Wikipedia says: <br>  <i>Intellect (from the Latin. Intellectus - feeling, perception, understanding, understanding, concept, mind) - the quality of the psyche, consisting of the ability to adapt to new situations, the ability to learn from experience, to understand and apply abstract concepts and use their knowledge to manage the environment by the medium.</i>  <i>General ability to know and solve difficulties, which unites all cognitive abilities of a person: sensation, perception, memory, representation, thinking, imagination.</i> <br><br>  A lot of blurry and constructive enough.  And for success we need precisely - a constructive definition. <br><br>  So, the known definitions of intelligence do not give anything practical. <br><br>  Let us try to give the definition of intelligence, maximum constructivism in the sense of the possibility of realization, yes, yes, neither more nor less.  I will note that the constructivism of the definition of intelligence will be achieved by its weakening and deliverance from the aura of romanticism and absolutism. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Let's see what facts we have: <br>  1) natural intelligence is inherent only in living organisms. <br>  2) living organisms formed during the evolutionary process <br><br>  Thus, intelligence cannot be considered without life!  Let‚Äôs start with it, what is life? <br><br>  <b>Ii.</b>  <b>A life</b> <br><br>  Let's look for definitions - again the sheer complexity of verbosity and descriptiveness.  I will not even give them, you can google it yourself.  But meanwhile they come across with a sound grain of constructivism, and we need, I would say, merciless constructivism without any romance.  What is a living organism?  We will move from the understanding formulated by E. Schr√∂dinger in the book "What is life?".  In my opinion it is the most fundamental and common. <br><br>  <i>Such systems are called living, which independently maintain their orderliness.</i>  <i>Regardless of the degree of environmental disorder, the living system retains its orderliness.</i> <br><br>  This definition is in terms of entropy.  What is the specific result of this definition?  The applications of this definition are homeostatic systems, which, through self-regulation, maintain the constancy of their internal state.  <i>Let us</i> reformulate: <i>we will call homeostatic systems alive</i> !  The task of homeostasis satisfies the criterion of the struggle with an increase in entropy.  Let us cling to this definition, although it describes a very wide range of objects that may not be subjectively perceived alive.  In particular, according to this definition, any system with a feedback control loop is live.  Will you laugh?  The fridge is a live system.  It will have to admit, and what are you used to consider alive?  Well, yourself - exactly or at least the simplest bacterium with DNA?  Yes, precisely, I think that in our perception of life there is a significant proportion of subjectivism.  We idealize life, just like ourselves, transferring it to the category of the Absolute, possibly admitting to its title, only components with DNA from which, we are composed.  It is difficult to approach the concept of life rationally and pragmatically. <br><br>  <b>Iii.</b>  <b>Intelligence</b> <br><br>  Well, we came directly to the intellect.  Immediately I will say here we again level another romantic concept.  As it turns out, there is nothing really special about the intellect from my point of view. <br><br>  For now, let's use intuitive considerations: <br>  Does man have intelligence?  - Yes. <br>  Does the dog have intelligence?  - Yes. <br>  The frog has intelligence?  Apparently - yes. <br>  Does a nematode (earthworm) have intelligence?  We assume - yes. <br><br>  Here is a hint of a weakening of the concept of intelligence.  Blow off his romanticism.  We give a definition: <br><br>  <i>If a living system uses a dedicated behavior management subsystem, then this subsystem will be called intelligence.</i> <br><br>  Let us explain: Bacteria does not possess intelligence - there is no dedicated control subsystem.  But the earthworm has the intellect,  it has a clearly defined nervous system.  You will laugh again - the refrigerator has the intelligence, because  He has a special regulator! <br><br>  The intelligence of a living system fully operates on the main objective functional: to survive despite the second law of thermodynamics.  As a rule, the intelligence subsystem is highly integrated into a set of preserving mechanisms.  Talking about the autonomous existence of intelligence without a set of preserving mechanisms and setting target behavior does not make sense, otherwise it splits into a set of individual functions, perhaps even advanced ones. <br><br>  Actually, about the intellect - everything.  Through these definitions, we have prepared the basis for the following concept. <br><br>  <b>Iv.</b>  <b>Psyche</b> <br><br>  Here we enter a region that has always eluded technical experts, but who always meant it, agreeing with the statement: the machine cannot create a masterpiece.  Let's try to formalize this area. <br>  If we turn to different kinds of definitions of the psyche (you can find and read for yourself), then we will again come up with verbose statements in which there is no most important thing, from which everything else follows.  We define that the key phenomenon in the concept of the psyche is self-awareness! <br><br>  We give a definition: <br><br>  <i>A living system with intelligence has a psyche if:</i> <i><br></i>  <i>1) has adaptive behavior management properties</i> <i><br></i>  <i>2) in the process of adapting and building a picture of the surrounding world, it generates and identifies selected concepts corresponding to the surrounding objects and processes</i> <i><br></i>  <i>3) in the process of adapting and building a picture of the world around it generates and identifies a concept that corresponds to itself</i> <br><br>  It can be noted that a difficult task has crept into this definition: algorithms with adaptive properties.  Namely, they can constitute the main difficulty in designing such a system.  As is known in biological applications, the role of such algorithms is performed by information systems based on neural networks.  Realizations of neural networks in themselves give little, and can be suitable, only for individual tasks.  To reproduce the psyche, you need to use them in the appropriate architecture.  Talking about the autonomous existence of the psyche, as well as intelligence without a set of preserving mechanisms and setting target behavior, does not make sense.  The basis of the psyche consists in the target behavior of preserving mechanisms: the survival-preservation system. <br><br>  Conclusion: thanks to the extremely constructive definitions of life and intelligence, it was possible to constructively determine the psyche. <br><br>  <b>V. Architecture</b> <br><br>  In this part we will try to consider, no less and no less, the architecture of a living system with intelligence. <br><br>  As indicated above, the living system has a complex of mechanisms-reactions of the target behavior, which have retaining meaning. <br><br>  The built-in mechanisms for target behavior are divided into hierarchy levels: <br>  1) Unconditioned reflexes are characteristic of all systems with intelligence. <br>  2) Rituals are characteristic of more developed organisms, rituals have abstracted objectives and suggest higher levels of the context of the environment and communication interaction.  It is important that the rituals have goals that must be achieved and are 'sewn' into the package of target behavior for preservation - the survival of the system. <br>  3) The adaptive subsystem, which, using its adaptive capabilities, optimizes the behavior of controlling the lower level circuits - basic reflexes, as well as rituals. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/ba8/2e7/3a7/ba82e73a7c624cc3a391e1ecbf0ce435.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Reflexes and rituals are formed by genetic algorithms in the evolutionary process. <br><br>  The basic reflexes include the recognizers of basic sensory patterns and the drivers (drives) of basic locomotion for actuators and the actual basic reactions to recognized patterns. <br><br>  Rituals are a higher abstract level of recognition of patterns and the formation of behavior, rather than locomotion. <br><br>  The adaptive subsystem accumulates data and adapts behavior during the life of the system.  On the basis of an adaptive system, a psyche can form, and perhaps not.  It depends on her strength and learning experience. <br><br>  <b>Vi.</b>  <b>Conclusion</b> <br><br>  The success of the implementation of systems of strong intelligence, can lean against the wrong formulation of the problem.  Above, an attempt was made to formulate the correct formulation of the problem. <br><br>  The question of the implementation of advanced algorithms (neural networks) with adaptive properties that can isolate, learn, and then recognize concepts remains open. <br><br>  I think there is nothing fantastic in such algorithms (neural networks), and today steps are being taken to create them.  For example, the implementation of a neural network that has learned to play reinforcement games ( <a href="https://geektimes.ru/post/246444">AI from Google independently mastered 49 old Atari games</a> ) is a step in the right direction.  By the way, it would be interesting to do research - if the neural network is formed during training on games, the selected concept signals correspond to certain game objects and situations. <br><br>  Obviously, learning adaptive prospective intelligence systems should be carried out by reinforcement from basic reflexes and rituals. <br><br>  Above, we rejected the idealistic perception of life, the intellect and the psyche.  But still leave as an ideal - Mind.  Definition for the concept of reason to give in my opinion is impossible, and should not be.  If one could say that Man possesses Mind, then do not dispute the fact that not every man has a mind ... </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/392679/">https://habr.com/ru/post/392679/</a></p>
