We decided that we do not need a website anymore.  It also happens that there is something interesting.  Only now a month passes, another, a third ... and the site is working! <br>  The former owner refers to the developer of the site and then to the hoster - how did it happen?

    <h4>  Resurrection </h4><br><br>  There is no mystery in this, it seems.  The domain was released and immediately registered by the new owner.  The only reasonable question is where does the new owner of the site engine and database come from? <br>  Mole in the company?  Excluded, no one had access. <br>  The site developer has adapted the content and domain that the owner does not need?  Swears not - did and forgot. <br>  Hoster, here it is - the axis of universal evil!  Yes, no either.  The hoster warned that it was time to renew the domain, received a reply that the domain was not needed and the site could also be deleted - and deleted the domain with the site after the registration period expired. <br>  Password leakage, hacking site, loss of control over the mailbox, ... voodoo?  "I do not believe in voodoo."  (c) Dogma <br><br>  And the site works. <br>  I am sure that the% habrauser% already guessed what was the matter.  The site was robbed in statics, in advance, before purchasing the vacated domain.  In the same form in which he was.  Yes, now you will not enter the admin panel, and you will not use the search.  But the content - in place on the old links.  While the new owner is thinking what to do with the acquisition, the CY with PR will not be lost.  And maybe the old owner will appear, the domain will buy.  Only now the old owner anyway, there is a site - there is no site.  It works after all, the information is the same, even the old advertising has remained.  Well, let it work.  Yes, and no claims from the former owner is not. <br><br>  And should have been.  After all, if a domain is acquired quite officially, then the information on the site is by no means. <br>  Is it time to give a pruflink?  Please: uk-vozrogdenie.ru (there is nothing interesting in general, a quasi-Joomla site, a clickable screen). <br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/habraeffect/82/bb/82bb688807377bed7100d8dd8b5650c6.png" alt="image"></a> <br><br><h4>  Attack <s>in</s> new </h4><br><br>  So who is he, the new owner?  I agree, a rhetorical question. <br>  Private person vasievge-hack-gmail.com, and a bit of searching leads to the conclusion that this is most likely Evgeniy V Vasilyev Vasilyev, but who knows for sure?  Is that Ru-Center.  Domain with the status of VERIFIED. <br><br>  How many such dead dead does he have?  I will cite a few more: zz-r.ru, x-mars.ru, 1c-programs.ru, zvezdobar.ru ... <br>  Stop!  The last two are a completely different case.  These are clones.  And here are the originals: artmedia-barnaul.ru and archekon.ru, respectively.  No, archekon.ru is also a miracle of genetic engineering.  archekon.com - the original site.  No wonder you get confused. <br><br>  I am sure that such examples are numerous, and many are known, I will be glad to add updates to the article.  So, crowds of resurrected and cloned sites roam the Internet.  Perhaps a good idea for a startup is to bring them all together? <br><br><h4>  Folk methods of dealing with evil spirits </h4><br><br>  Garlic is not suitable here, here's an aspen stake ... no, this is already a criminal act, and even against vampires, it seems.  And the Jedi sword against the clones is good, but it will remain a pipe dream of childhood. <br><br><ul><li>  If you no longer need a site, but you are anxious about the reputation of your company, delete the site, and let the domain live for a year or two <s>in</s> the hospitality domain parking.  You can leave - suddenly come in handy. </li><li>  If you need your website - check sometimes if clones, phishing, copy-paste have not started ... </li></ul><br><br>  About how to defend, and what to do - if you find the villains - many copies are already broken on Habr√©, it depends on the situation.  Phishing is removed easily, but to prove that the site is cloned, and especially since the article is stolen - it can be problematic. <br>  And in general, there is no protection against this. <br><br>  Or maybe her, undead, let him frolic? <br><br>  <b>UPD</b> : how, why and why you can ask <a href="http://geektimes.ru/users/interitus/" class="user_link">Interitus</a> - the owner of the mentioned domains, i.e.  the physical owner is the figurehead, and the actual owner is he. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/99224/">https://habr.com/ru/post/99224/</a></p>
