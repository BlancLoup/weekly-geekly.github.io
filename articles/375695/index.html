The idea of ‚Äã‚Äãthis project was born long and long nurtured only in my head ... <br><br>  In the garage was a scooter.  I will not describe his story, just briefly: <br><ul><li>  The frame is welded in two parts from the Yamaha Champ RS (front) and Yamaha Champ CX scooters. </li><li>  Landing redone with a scooter on a motorcycle. </li><li>  Engine taken from Champ CX, fully bruised, capacity increased to 70cc.  Powerful, reliable unit. </li><li>  The entire periphery of the engine (battery, gas tank, oil tank, electrician, etc.) moved from the ass and beak to the new engine compartment </li><li>  Preparing the original kit and optics </li></ul><br>  There are a couple of old photos. <br><br>  The cardboard dries:

    <img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/f3f/696/e48/f3f696e48f82468a816b1ca96e41cecc.jpg"><br><br>  Guts: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/aa3/696/9ef/aa36969efa4a42748da4d379dd93b69f.jpg"><br><br>  At that time, the idea was to create a plastic-lined scooter, similar to a motorcycle with a comfortable interior layout.  The new bike was seen very cool, but the inconvenience of the very design of the motorcycle is constantly pushed to the thought of alteration.  After long googling and deliberation, the reverse trike design was chosen: <br><br><ul><li>  Stable position without movement (step is no longer needed). </li><li>  Excellent weight distribution and, accordingly, handling. </li><li>  Improved braking by 3 wheels. </li><li>  More room to install any husk. </li><li>  Appearance is also a good plus. </li></ul><br>  Suspension parts (two transverse triangular levers, steering knuckles and tie rods on each side) are homemade using VAZ spare parts.  Shock absorbers are rear of the scooter. <br><br>  One half is ready, all sizes are maintained: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/2c7/e45/2d5/2c7e452d563c420da64534b72874ceef.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/78d/9aa/0b4/78d9aa0b49404aa5a8abebe5046f16f2.jpg"><br><br>  It turned out hard, the safety factor of parts from the car for a scooter is enough with the head.  The weight of the frame has increased markedly, it has become harder for one to turn it in the garage, but not so much that the engine could not cope with it and the driver.  The interior space and appearance is also completely satisfied. <br><br><h4>  Rounding </h4><br>  Experience in the design and assembly of the mechanical part is already available.  The season is over: the rains have come and the cold comes up.  The idea of ‚Äã‚Äãcreating another vehicle arose naturally.  It is unpleasant to ride a scooter in bad weather, and in a car it is always dry and warm.  But the modern car itself is impractical: the same engine VAZ-2108 1500kub.sm.  with a mass of about 250 kg (together with a checkpoint), it carries an average of 100‚Äì200 kg of payload and about 700 kg of ballast in the form of a body, suspension, interior parts, etc.  Too cumbersome.  70cc  The scooter's engine weighs about 25kg and accelerates 80kg of payload and about 45kg of ballast is very brisk.  With a sharp start the wheel scrolls, the maximum speed - for 60km / h.  In general, there are enough flaws everywhere.  The main parameters for improving road cars have always been <u>power</u> , <u>fuel consumption</u> and <u>comfort</u> .  In sport, instead of expense and comfort - <u>weight</u> and <u>stiffness</u> .  The purpose of the construction of the trike, however, was not to achieve maximum speeds or comfortable movement around the city.  But certain requirements have already been formed. <br><br>  So, round up the experience, summarize and set the task: <br><br><ol><li>  The body structure is a reinforced frame made of pipes and a profile around one driver's seat. </li><li>  Simple front wheel suspension (self-made, such as MacPherson) and easy handling. </li><li>  Rear - motor-wheel of sufficient power with an automatic transmission. </li><li>  Sealed and soundproofed interior. </li><li>  Management and control of the state of the engine and trike in general - from a computer. </li><li>  Everything must be made to the maximum of the available parts and materials.  The manufacture of parts to order is not considered. </li></ol><br>  These are the basic requirements for the design with further improvements.  The base for experiments, research and testing of various systems, it seems to me, is sufficient. <br><br><h4>  On your marks! </h4><br>  Hmm, so!  Drawings of the main elements are made, tools and materials have been prepared, work has begun. <br><br>  Photos from the construction process are very few and of poor quality: only an old phone was at hand, and my hands were constantly dirty.  Therefore, I decided to take all the photos of the finished design with a detailed description of the creation and operation of the most interesting nodes.  But still a few pictures still left. <br><br>  I would like to see in the end: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/4ce/323/dd9/4ce323dd92d24de78a640c1476f120df.jpg"><br><br>  Gradually boil the frame: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/c1e/b3d/181/c1eb3d1814724349b64ccabf9b3e1e57.jpg"><br><br>  While the frame is not ready, let's move on to the next part - the trik control and management system.  Description, diagrams and photos in the next part. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/375695/">https://habr.com/ru/post/375695/</a></p>
