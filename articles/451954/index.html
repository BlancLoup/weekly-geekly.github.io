  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Even more secret telegrams</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"><p>  Everyone is accustomed to consider telegrams a reliable and secure medium for transmitting messages of any kind.  However, under the hood, he turns a completely ordinary combination of a- and symmetric encryption, but this is not at all interesting.  And in the end, why bother to explicitly trust your messages to a third party? <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/fj/xl/ka/fjxlkasq2yqy1vfjle83rlnc4js.png" alt="KDPV by Antonio Proh√≠as"><br>  TL; DR - we invent a private hidden channel through users blocking each other. </p><a name="habracut"></a><br><h2 id="skrytyy-kanal">  Covert channel </h2><br><p>  There are many workarounds for transferring data between two users, avoiding explicit contact.  You can use intermediaries, crypto and steganography, broadcast relay networks and other add-ons over existing protocols.  But sometimes it is useful to be able to make contact using only the official stated opportunities.  That is, organize a <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%25A1%25D0%25BA%25D1%2580%25D1%258B%25D1%2582%25D1%258B%25D0%25B9_%25D0%25BA%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BB">hidden channel</a> . </p><br><p>  A simple and understandable example of a hidden channel for a Russian-speaking reader is a flower in a turnout window of seventeen moments of spring.  By itself, he can either stand or not stand on the window - such a symbiosis is quite common and only speaks of the owner's love for flowers.  Only a predetermined interpretation distinguishes the information transmitted by the scout from the information she receives from random passersby. </p><br><p><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/xq/z2/bs/xqz2bs06a68qp9m11r-fpqgy6fo.jpeg" alt="Flower in the window"></p><br><h2 id="cvetochno-okonnye-kanaly-telegrama">  Flower-window channels telegraph </h2><br><p>  For the organization of its hidden channel, by such an example, only two things are conceptually needed: a window and a flower.  The window describes the object available for changing and determining the state, and the flower the possible values ‚Äã‚Äãand the method for changing them. </p><br><p>  So what can someone change Alice in a telegraph, which is available for viewing a certain Bob?  Yes, a lot of things: avatars, usernames, last visit time and much more.  However, they are usually available to everyone at once, which limits the privacy of a possible dialogue ‚Äî anyone with knowledge of the transmission method will be able to listen to the messages being sent.  Oddly enough, this restriction can be circumvented without the use of cryptography. </p><br><h3 id="v-chernom-chernom-spiske">  Black and black list </h3><br><p>  Each user has his own unique blacklist, and if the reader has been in it at least once, he should have noticed that the date of the last visit to the abuser changed to "last seen a long time ago" along with the empty avatar.  In fact, the user could be online at least a second ago and change a hundred cats in his profile, but the Telegram API simply does not return this data to the application.  In this way, it protects your privacy from unwanted persons, instead of letting them know that they are blocked. </p><br><p>  What is the result in common between the flower in the window and being on the blocking list?  Both can be checked at a certain point in time by receiving one bit of information depending on whether you are on the black list or not.  An additional bonus is the fact that telegrams most likely do not store in their logs (and if they do, not for long only for the purpose of journaling) the history of blocking each other‚Äôs users. </p><br><h2 id="organizovyvaem-bity">  Organizing bits </h2><br><p>  The ability to transmit and receive bits is, of course, good, but still you need to describe the full mechanism of its operation.  The telegram does not send notifications to users when they are added to the blacklist, so the reception of each bit must be initiated by the recipient (Bob) and not dependent on the sender (Alice).  It also follows that Alice and Bob must perform requests with the same frequency so that each recipient clock corresponds with one recipient clock. </p><br><p>  The exchange algorithm itself at each clock cycle looks like this: </p><br><ul><li>  A checks the sent bit and, if you want to send a signal, depending on its value: <br><ul><li>  A -&gt; T: block B; </li><li>  A -&gt; T: unlock B. </li></ul></li><li>  B gets a bit: <br><ul><li>  B -&gt; T: user request A; </li><li>  T -&gt; B: available B information about A; </li><li>  B: checks whether the received information status: <br><ul><li>  B: if there is -&gt; it is not blocked and 0 is received </li><li>  B: if not -&gt; it is blocked and received 1 </li></ul></li></ul></li></ul><br><p>  Most modern user processors have good built-in frequency generators (at least, a system clock), so the clocks can be synchronized with their help without using the data transfer channel itself.  One has only to note that requests to the telegram API are networked and do not rush to work quickly, which is not helped by the fact of its blocking in the territory of the Russian Federation and the need to use a proxy.  But the tact length should on average exceed the time required to complete these requests, so the frequency and data transfer rate is extremely small. </p><br><h3 id="kodiruem-soobscheniya">  We encode messages </h3><br><p>  Texts in natural language have a fairly high redundancy, so the messages received with errors will still often be understandable to humans.  And since telegram is still a messenger, despite attempts to attach all sorts of graphic-audio-video gadgets to it, error correction can be neglected by limiting the transmitted data by text messages. </p><br><p>  Due to the low bandwidth of the covert channel, it is necessary to use the most efficient coding for possible messages.  Fortunately, the very name of the messenger reminds us of the times when such problems were commonplace. </p><br><p>  Therefore, being in the 21st century, we will encode texts with one of the most effective methods available to telegraph operators a century ago - <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%259A%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B4_%25D0%2591%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B4%25D0%25BE">the Bodo code</a> .  More precisely, with its latest variation ITA-2, authored by Murray, in order to make fewer API calls on frequently encountered characters.  It is possible to complain about the lack of the Russian language, but in my view, transliteration is a simpler way out than the <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%259C%25D0%25A2%25D0%259A-2">sacrifice of additional symbols to everyone Yu and Y.</a> </p><br><p>  It remains only to determine the beginning and the end of each data transfer session so that the receiving party can select the messages transmitted to it among the large flow.  Before the transfer, Bob is either on the black list or outside.  Then Alice signals the beginning of the transfer, changing this state for one clock cycle to the opposite.  At the end of the program, she simply unlocks Bob.  He continues to receive null characters until he has accumulated enough to reliably state the end of the transmission. </p><br><p><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/ci/pw/2a/cipw2arrv1vwonj6r0iyzwgkzda.png" alt="On the timeline"></p><br><p>  The disadvantage of this approach is the practical impossibility of connecting (more precisely, you can connect, but you have to tinker with manual error correction) to the already ongoing broadcast and separate erroneously received null characters from the actually transmitted ones.  However, these are already implementation problems. </p><br><h2 id="vysokie-tehnologii">  High tech </h2><br><p>  After several hours of trying to use the official library to interact with the API, I spat and wrote everything I needed on the python using the more human Telethon.  The author even presents the API in a synchronous style, which for some reason has become a terrible rarity.  Encoding messages using ITA-2 had to write on the knee itself, since I did not really find anything ready. </p><br><p>  Frequency synchronization occurs on the system clock (and yes, the program sleeps! In intervals), which are sufficiently accurate if you consider the required time to perform requests to the API, which is consistently more than a tenth of a second.  The user can set the transfer rate as desired, however, I use the principle ‚Äúno more request per second‚Äù to avoid both errors and freezing for spam with the same type of requests.  Telegram, in general, turned out to be very picky about using its API, freezing access to the account through it for a day, even if you just made three authorizations (moreover, successful) in a row, as well as random short-term locks for unknown reasons. </p><br><p> If users exchange telegrams via a hidden channel, they don‚Äôt need a special GUI.  And not everywhere it is, so I wrote a regular console utility.  It allows you to wait in one run and receive a message using the specified user ID, or send it by reading from the command line arguments.  Nobody, of course, prohibits the use of several channels at once, as well as receiving and transmitting messages in parallel, you just need to run several instances in parallel. </p><br><h3 id="primer-ispolzovaniya">  Usage example </h3><br><p>  To use, you need to get your api_id and api_hash from the telegram by <a href="https://core.telegram.org/api/obtaining_api_id">this instruction</a> and set the values ‚Äã‚Äãin the file 'covertele.py'.  The command line arguments specify the desired action, your ID, the recipient ID, and the message to be sent, if it is the sender.  It all looks something like this: </p><br><pre><code class="plaintext hljs"> :  : Enter your phone number: XXX | Enter your phone number: XXX Enter auth code: YYY | Enter auth code: YYY Started message transmission... | Listening for the message... ---++ ('O', '9') | ---++ ('O', '9') --+-+ ('H', '#') | --+-+ ('H', '#') +++++ (1, 1) | +++++ (1, 1) --++- ('N', ',') | --++- ('N', ',') --+-- (' ', ' ') | --+-- (' ', ' ') ++-++ (0, 0) | ++-++ (0, 0) --+-+ ('H', '#') | --+-+ ('H', '#') -++-- ('I', '8') | -++-- ('I', '8') --+-- (' ', ' ') | --+-- (' ', ' ') --+++ ('M', '.') | --+++ ('M', '.') ++--- ('A', '-') | ++--- ('A', '-') -+-+- ('R', "'") | -+-+- ('R', "'") ++++- ('K', '(') | ++++- ('K', '(') +++++ (1, 1) | +++++ (1, 1) +-++- ('F', '!') | +-++- ('F', '!') --+++ ('M', '.') | --+++ ('M', '.') --+++ ('M', '.') | --+++ ('M', '.') Done, exiting... | ----- ('', '') | ----- ('', '') | Automatically decoded: OH, HI MARK!..</code> </pre> <br><p>  The text is decoded automatically, but lovers of searching for errors with their hands, reading on the go and tracking progress can do it all by outputting the codes sent and received. </p><br><p>  If anyone wants, you can also use the simple API provided: </p><br><pre> <code class="plaintext hljs">from covertele import TelegramBlockingAPI from cochannel import CovertChannel friend = input("     :") #           #  ,     -,      id = input("  :") api = TelegramBlockingAPI(id) #        friend = input("Enter your friend's id:") channel = CovertChannel(api, friend) #    channel.receive()  channel.send()     channel.send("Bork, bork!") print(channel.receive) #       ,       _raw codes = channel.receive_raw() for code in codes: check(code) channel.send_raw([19, 24, 24, 13])</code> </pre> <br><h2 id="za-predelami-telegrama">  Outside the telegram </h2><br><p>  It is clear that such a channel can be organized on top of any messenger in which there is a method for determining whether other users are blocking themselves.  At the same time, similar interfaces are easily implemented and substituted in a similar way into the code.  So if there is a desire - you can use ready-made, and not to write coding, etc. from scratch.  Fortunately, a slow python is unlikely to interfere with bitwise transmission at such speeds. </p><br><p>  PS Special thanks to my passion for love to throw me in an emergency. </p><br><ul><li>  <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/452434/">English version on Habr√©</a> </li><li>  <a href="https://medium.com/%40labunskya/secret-telegrams-bdd2035b6e84">English version on medium</a> </li><li>  <a href="https://github.com/LabunskyA/covertele">Github</a> </li></ul></div>
