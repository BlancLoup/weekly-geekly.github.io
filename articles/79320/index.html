So, under the cut, I will try to tell you how you can flash the phone with full-fledged firmware with full-fledged Android Market, Russification and the possibility of buying paid programs. <br>  This manual is particularly relevant for the official Ukrainian HTC Hero, but is suitable for owners of any Hero who want to change the firmware of their phone or open access to additional functions of their phone. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><ul><li>  <b>The update will reset all settings and personal data in your phone so sync contacts with gmail!</b> </li><li>  <b>Everything that you do, you do at your own peril and risk and no one will bear any responsibility if you do something wrong and your Hero turns into a brick (the probability is minimal, but who has few curves?</b> </li></ul><br><br>  The whole process of unlocking and flashing the phone can be divided into 2 main stages: <br>  1. Firmware update Recovery- special menu for repairing and flashing phones, which will allow to flash third-party firmware (not from HTC) <br>  2. Directly firmware third-party firmware. <br><br>  <b>1. Firmware Modified Recovery</b> <br>  You should start by checking the firmware version of your phone. It depends on how hard the process of ‚Äúhacking‚Äù the firmware will be.  After the firmware version 411.5, Hero closed some holes and it became much more difficult to unlock the phone.  To check the version, go to Phone Settings - About phone and look at the firmware version: <br><ul><li>  If you have firmware 411.5 or earlier, I congratulate you.  Unlocking your phone is almost no problem - for you <b>Option number 1</b> : </li><li>  If you have a newer firmware, but the phone is Russian official (PCT sticker) - <b>Option 2</b> for you </li><li>  If you have an official Ukrainian phone, or a phone from countries farther away, and in them a new firmware - you are unlucky, you will find the most complex <b>Option number 3</b> </li></ul><br>  <b>Option number 1 (the easiest)</b> Suitable for phones with old firmware. <br>  Installing third-party recovery - It will allow you to install updates without a digital signature.  So go: <br>  You must have Internet connection on your phone, preferably Wi-Fi, since  download will have about 5 megabytes. <br><ul><li>  Go to the phone settings and in the menu "Applications" put a tick in front of "Unknown sources."  The answer to the warning is affirmative. </li><li>  Open the browser and in the address bar type r.androidfan.ru/flashrec.apk (~ 83 Kb).  Then press Enter, download the application and install it. You can install flashrec without the Internet, then you need to throw flashrec.apk into the root of the SD card.  Then open the browser and enter the following perverted address: <br>  content: //com.android.htmlfileprovider/sdcard/flashrec.apk </li><li>  Launch Recovery Flasher, it should be first in the list of applications. <br>  In the input field there should be a link to <a href="">r.androidfan.ru/recovery-hero.img</a> (~ 3.5 MB) Click ‚ÄúDownload Recovery Image‚Äù and wait while it downloads.  As an option, if there is no wi-fi at hand and it's a pity to waste precious traffic, then you can put recovery-hero.img on a USB flash drive, and in FlashRec in the address bar type /sdcard/recovery-hero.img <br>  We make backup of the old Recovery to the memory card, for this we click "Create Backup Recovery" <br>  We press "flash Recovery", if everything is successful - then the inscription "Firmware done" should appear.  Congratulations, you got a pass to the world of third-party firmware </li></ul><br>  <b>Option number 2 (more difficult)</b> <br>  You are not lucky, and your firmware version is higher than 411.5 - you will have to go through the ‚Äúhumiliating‚Äù procedure of downgrade - lowering the firmware version to open ‚Äúclosed holes‚Äù.  You will need the official older firmware HTC Hero <br><ul><li>  Download it from here: <a href="">files.androidfan.ru/flash/hero/RUU_Hero_HTC_RUS_2.73.411.5.rom.zip</a> </li><li>  Rename it to heroimg.zip and put it in the root of the sd card </li><li>  run the bootloader (power + backspase).  When the bootloader menu appears, click on the volume to decrease, then the firmware check will start, then click home for the firmware </li></ul><br>  And then - look and do <b>Option number 1</b>

      <b>Option number 3 (the most difficult)</b> <br>  If you have a non-Ukrainian (Chinese, Vietnamese, etc.) phone or option number 2 issued a Wrong CID, then you will only save the creation of <b>GoldCard</b> , which will allow to flash your phone with official firmware from any other regions. <br>  For this you need: <br><ul><li>  Computer with SD card reader + Sd-MicroSd adapter </li><li>  <a href="">HxD Hex Editor</a> </li><li>  MicroSD card with capacity from 128 MB to 2GB (native card from camplet is not always suitable for operation) SanDisk flash drives often do not work with this method, my method worked only with transend microSD for 2GB </li></ul><br>  Step 1. Find out the unique serial number of the card.  To do this, install Terminal Emulator (http://r.androidfan.ru/terminal.apk) on the phone, launch it and type the following commands: <br> <code>ls /sys/class/mmc_host/mmc1/</code> <br>  we get the answer like: device mmc1: XXXX (XXXX is a unique number) <br>  after that we give the command: <br> <code>cat /sys/class/mmc_host/mmc1/mmc1:XXXX/cid</code> <br>  For example, my number was 1b534d303030303010b1de9d11008860 <br>  <b>upd: How correctly prompted, we turn the code: for this we download the QMAT <a href="http://revskills.de/pages/download.html">from here.</a> Attention-demo version only works 10 minutes. Select Cryptoanalysis Tools then Crypto Toolbox. At the bottom of the form there is a text field. Enter your sid there, click Reverse String. two characters replace 00-for example 12345678910 will be 00345678910</b> <br>  Step 2. Go here <a href="http://revskills.de/pages/goldcard.html">revskills.de/pages/goldcard.html</a> and enter your email and the number you received, send you a file (goldcard.img) to your email that you need to write to the beginning of the flash drive. <br>  Step # 3 Through the card reader and the adapter, insert the card into the computer, format the USB flash drive into fat32 <br>  Copy the file to it from here: <a href="">files.androidfan.ru/flash/hero/RUU_Hero_HTC_RUS_2.73.411.5.rom.zip</a> , after renaming it to heroimg.zip <br>  Step number 4.  Run HxD Hex Editor.  In it, in the top bar, select Extra&gt; Open Disk.  In the Physical disk column, select Removable Disk, remove the check mark from ‚ÄúOpen as Readonly), and click OK. <br><img src="http://forum.androidfan.ru/index.php?act=attach&amp;type=post&amp;id=834" alt="image"><br>  Go to Extra - Open Disk Image, and select goldcard.img, which we received in the mail (when opening, select "Sector Size" 512 (Hard disks / Floppy disks), and click OK. <br><img src="http://forum.androidfan.ru/index.php?act=attach&amp;type=post&amp;id=835" alt="image"><br>  Then from the goldcard.img file we copy all the items with 00000000 - 00000170 and paste them into the Removable Disk (your hard disk) with the replacement. Then click on the save and vaul- Your GoldCard is ready! <br>  And then - look and make <b>Option # 2</b> , then - <b>Option # 1</b> <br>  As a result of all these simple transformations, we get a <s>cyclopentan perhydrofinance cell</s> phone, ready for any adventure.  THOSE.  to any third-party firmware. <br>  And now the second stage, which is much simpler than the first <br>  <b>2. Directly flashing the phone</b> <br>  There are a lot of firmware for HTC Hero, most of all you can find them <a href="http://forum.xda-developers.com/forumdisplay.php%3Ff%3D512">here.</a> <br>  Here is a small selection with <b>lelvisl</b> comments <b>.</b> <br><ul><li>  <a href="http://forum.androidfan.ru/index.php%3Fshowtopic%3D1131">Hero_HTC_RUS_2.73.411.17 Rooted the</a> most recent Russian firmware for a hero with root rights </li><li>  <a href="http://forum.androidfan.ru/index.php%3Fshowtopic%3D1182">A collection of official non-rooted firmware</a> </li><li>  <a href="http://forum.androidfan.ru/index.php%3Fshowtopic%3D1297">MoDaCo mod</a> - alternative request from comrade modaco, with root rules and modified kernel. </li><li>  <a href="http://forum.androidfan.ru/index.php%3Fshowtopic%3D1246">HERO 2.1</a> - beta builds of the firmware for the hero, based on android version 2.1 (Eclair), rutovana </li></ul><br>  To reflash any of them, you will need to download the firmware file, rename it to update.zip, and put it in the root of the sd card. <br>  After that, go to the recovery of the phone (when you turn on, hold down the Home button) <br>  - Make factory reset - wipe (delete the data of the old firmware) <br>  - Apply update - flash the phone with a modified firmware <br><br>  If you managed to do all of the above, I congratulate you on the successful hacking of your phone! <br><br>  And finally, if you want to <b>officially buy paid programs in the Android Market</b> (as long as it is not available for the CIS countries), download and install the <a href="http://code.google.com/p/market-enabler/">Market Enabler</a> program. <br>  It will allow you to replace the code of the cellular network by introducing you to the user of the mobile networks of the countries of the ‚Äúfirst world‚Äù according to Google - those who allow the purchase of programs. <br>  PS: In the preparation of the material used materials Forum <a href="http://forum.androidfan.ru/">AndroidFan</a> , and especially users <a href="https://geektimes.ru/users/hobbit19/" class="user_link">hobbit19</a> , <a href="https://geektimes.ru/users/tamerlan311/" class="user_link">tamerlan311</a> , lelvisl. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/79320/">https://habr.com/ru/post/79320/</a></p>
