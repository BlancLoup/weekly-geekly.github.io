  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Scientific vacuum</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Over the last year, you and I have witnessed many scandals around cuts in the field of IT projects, such as: <a href="http://novikov.habrahabr.ru/blog/19991/">School portal</a> , <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/linux/63636/">open source software in schools</a> , and a <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/it-politics/69490/">domestic browser</a> .  You can, of course, argue about whether these are real projects, and whether those who participated in their penetration will be punished for success and failure or not. <br><br>  However, I want to draw your attention to a topic that has so far been overlooked by the public - I am talking about science. <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  For employees of the scientific sphere, communication in their environment and obtaining relevant information is one of the prerequisites for personal development and professional growth.  Attending specialized conferences and studying scientific publications is one of the most important stimulators of scientific activity.  But there are many problems associated, on the one hand, with the financing of business trips to conferences, and, on the other hand, with the dissemination of scientific results in the form of printed products.  If you can think of nothing with the first problem in the near future.  That second is very much solved.

      I often argue with my colleagues about the need to publish scientific articles on the Internet.  To which I often get the answer: there is no copyright on the Internet!  No tools!  No review!  And in general, it is not prestigious.  My arguments that the results should be available to the public, that the search among paper carriers is hopelessly outdated, and the UDC <sup>1</sup> system is not functional in modern realities, from the point of view of search, and no one is interested.  I think you, like me, obviously the superiority of search engines on the indexed text over the library index, and obtaining relevant information on the subject or subject for research is simply necessary. <br><br>  The natural fear of scientists and their pseudographers has good reasons.  The status of scientific publications on the Internet is extremely unequivocal.  In the last standard for bibliographic indexes there are instructions for creating a hyperlink as a source, but this is terrible, just like the standard itself. <br><br>  That's not all, there are two circumstances that are stopping the scientific community from actively publishing results on the Internet: <ul><li>  As long as the PRND <sup>2</sup> system exists, in which Internet publications are not taken into account in any way, and as long as they do not stand on the same level as printed ones, Internet publication is an empty sound for scientists and graduate students. </li><li>  The second important circumstance is fear.  The fear that the results are in fact a fiction, the fear that the publication will be ridiculed, and the fear of being dishonored throughout the Internet. </li></ul><br>  In my opinion, fear plays an even bigger role than the lack of incentive mechanisms.  After all, any scientist in a sense wants to make this world a better place, among these people there are many idealists and unmercenaries. <br><br>  I, of course, do not propose to turn the world around, while I propose to push off from what is already there.  And there is not so little: a huge number of peer-reviewed journals recommended by WAC.  All these journals are published on a regular basis and contain a lot of articles that are received by the editor in electronic form, are reviewed and are the most valuable.  The idea is that instead of pseudo-projects, it would be nice for the state to invest in a single electronic system for storing and publishing scientific results, that is, mandatory posting of all articles from peer-reviewed journals recommended by HAC in a certain open Internet portal with the ability to comment and search. <br><br>  The creation of such a system would greatly improve the dissemination of scientific results.  Indexing scientific texts and easily finding the necessary information among them could significantly push some research and would reduce costs at some stages.  This would certainly be useful both for the Internet community and for the scientific community as a whole. <br>  _________ <br>  1 Universal Decimal Classification (UDC) is a system designed to facilitate cataloging and searching among print publications. <br><br>  2 Indicators of scientific performance (PRND) - a method for determining individual indicators of the effectiveness of scientific activities of scientific workers of scientific organizations in the Russian Academy of Sciences and the recommended procedure for taking them into account. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/71733/">https://habr.com/ru/post/71733/</a></p>
