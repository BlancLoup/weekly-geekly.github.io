Blogger</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  <a href="http://crazyhamster.livejournal.com/193116.html">crazyhamster.livejournal.com/193116.html</a> <br><br>  <b>Thresh the World Wide Web</b> <br><br>  Spring came suddenly, right after three weeks of winter, and I was overtaken by a deep depression.  Melting ice and warming the weather never boded well.  Yes, this holiday flower sellers on the nose.  By the way, I can share with you ideas about gifts for March 8th.  For example, if you work in a women's team, boldly give all pregnant employees a pregnancy test!  A very useful thing in the household of any woman.  Another universal gift - weight.  Or a little weight weighing one kilogram.  It is also useful - to check that the market is not hung.  You can, of course, donate a blog, but this is trivial.  So let's look at them corny again. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  In its blog, the SUP service‚Äôs support service <a href="http://community.livejournal.com/sup_ru/112936.html">reported</a> that the restriction on 750 ‚Äúfriends‚Äù in force in LJ since 1999 has been lifted.  Now users of improved and basic accounts can start up to 1000 friends, and users of paid accounts can get up to 2000. I don‚Äôt understand why it is announced that the restriction has been lifted, if this hasn‚Äôt really happened, but just raised the threshold of the number of friends.  In addition, I still do not understand the meaning of the utility of this step.  I want to look at people who are physically able to read the messages of thousands and, especially, two thousand LJ-users.  The joy of the news will be experienced only by spammers who have already boosted their bots for cheating the blogs they need.

      The newspaper "Kommersant" conducted an analysis of blogs on the Russian Internet and found out which events and news of February aroused the most interest of users.  According to the analysis of blogs on the Russian Internet, the main news of February 2007 was the press conference of Vladimir Putin.  Only in the first two days of February, 1.5 thousand people commented on it.  Next in popularity are the news about the bombing of McDonald's in St. Petersburg, the death of Anna Nicole Smith, the Oscars award ceremony and the passing away of the poet Ilya Kormiltsev. <br><br>  Internet features <a href="http://internetno.net/2007/03/05/swiftpen/">tell</a> in detail about the new online service - <a href="http://www.swiftpen.ru/">swiftPen</a> .  What makes the new service?  Just allows you to leave messages on your blog.  Why do I need a separate website to post to the blog?  Well, first of all, you may have several blogs, and doing crossposting is not the most rewarding job.  Secondly, the admin could simply block your access to the blog server, and you really want to leave a message.  Thirdly, again, if you have a lot of blogs, then the entire history of messages will be stored in one place.  In fact, the service has a lot of advantages, it is a pity that it is slightly damp.  We will follow the development of events, and the development, by the way, is Russian. <br><br>  If you still do not understand LJ-celebrities, then a <a href="http://scandal-max.livejournal.com/577336.html">quick reference guide</a> for the first hundred of Yandex‚Äôs blog-rating from Maxim Alexandrov for you!  Moreover, this digest is not the first, so Max welcomes hundreds of newbies and says goodbye to the losers who took off from her last review.  Everything is clear and without unnecessary gestures, nickname - a comment in one sentence.  In principle, in order to have an interesting friend tape, you just need to franchise this hundred of the best. <br><br>  Many people think that Ken Downing is a journalist, which is quite a lot on shows.  In fact, he is the fashion director of the network of Neiman Marcus department stores and maintains a blog on his website.  Such is the new marketing tactic that retailers have adopted.  There is also a blogger on the eBay website - Constantine White, Style Director.  Usually fashion bloggers sit in the first row, take notes, and after the show in their hotel room, they put all the records together and post them on the Web.  Why director of fashion stores started blogs, you can <a href="http://www.vedomosti.ru/newspaper/article.shtml%3F2007/03/02/121708">find on the site of</a> Vedomosti. <br><br>  Oh, I have been saving the next text for a month to let it settle down, to acquire endurance, like that of good wine.  The community of the glorious hero-city of Minsk does not let the townspeople get bored; read the tearful mini-novels under the general title ‚Äú <a href="http://community.livejournal.com/minsk_by/2931002.html">Shops of Minsk and how we are served</a> ‚Äù.  Handkerchiefs are not included in the kit, so we use our own.  " <em>In the meantime, the queue does not even think to decrease. I will say more - it seems to have stopped at the same place. Ask what the question is? Yes, it‚Äôs just that three sellers work at the same time in the department. Do you think that this increases service speed? Figures. One seller a dozen minutes check the fight for some strange cuckoo clocks, the second carefully looks at this process, holding the box from this model, the third writes something about this watch in a common notebook, asking the second one, which, in turn, asks for first</em> ". <br><br>  Citizens and citizens who decide to start a blog and chose WordPress for this purpose, sometimes get lost in the wilds of a large number of plug-ins and do not know what to choose.  And in general, is it worth choosing.  Well, the hamster is in a hurry to help!  Here's <a href="http://zapletnyuk.org.ua/%3Fp%3D15">an article</a> in which, using the example of a regular blog, describes the main plugins for WordPress. <br><br>  And now the bad news.  If you downloaded WordPress 2.1.1 in the first four days of March, then your files may contain a backdoor, allowing a remote attacker to gain complete control over the vulnerable site.  The explanation says that after receiving messages from users, the developers checked the files published on the site and found that the distribution of version 2.1.1 was changed and different from the original.  It turned out that a hacker got access to the server serving wordpress.org and changed two files (‚Äútheme.php‚Äù and ‚Äúfeed.php‚Äù) in the distribution, adding the ability to remotely execute PHP code.  Only the distribution kit of version 2.1.1 was changed, the rest remained intact - according to the <a href="http://www.securitylab.ru/news/292056.php">Security Lab</a> .  The remedy is simple - update your blog to version 2.1.2 and change all passwords. <br><br>  The topic of sex has not yet been definitively disclosed in our reviews, so read the article " <a href="http://marta-ketro.livejournal.com/167404.html">Online Dating: Searching for Happiness through LJ</a> ."  What, however, is the optimistic conclusion of this text: ‚Äú <em>I don‚Äôt want to croak, but if love didn‚Äôt have it, then it‚Äôs almost impossible to part in LJ conditions, preserving dignity. It‚Äôs a link that developed to my friends‚Äôs eyes, falling apart, will cause condemnations. You will be "talked about this", regardless of your wishes. It‚Äôs good if you are an extrovert and can cry sweetly on the shoulders of friends, but if not, staying online can turn into torture</em> . " <br><br>  And to conclude this review by sending you an article <a href="http://www.computerra.ru/focus/309378">about podcasting and its impact on business</a> .  The podcast, by the way, has been very interesting for me lately, so wait a few articles about this in the near future.  Moreover, it is all closely intertwined with the territory of sound.  It turns out that listening to the voice of a blogger who speaks smart things, and not just reading them on a monitor, is also a special pleasure.  And as for the pleasure of these smart things dictated into the microphone, I will tell you the next time. <br><br>  <b>Virtual State Blogger <strong>Shusha Pepetsky</strong></b> <b><br><br></b>  <b><a href="http://kv.by/index2007100601.htm">Published in "Computer News" (‚Ññ10, 2007)</a></b> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/288074/">https://habr.com/ru/post/288074/</a></p>
