The article <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/company/trinion/blog/250893/">What is 1C.</a>  I promised to devote a separate article to the 1C-Bitrix software products in <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/company/trinion/blog/250893/">simple words about a complex system</a> , and now I fulfill this promise.  The article is a review, in it I will not delve into the technical details and features of the application of the program code, for this there is detailed documentation available to everyone on the official website of the company. <br><br>  Here I will talk about important features of the Bitrix Framework, as well as about software products created on this platform.  The article is intended, first of all, for users who seek to understand whether these or other Beatrix designs are necessary for their business, and what are their features.  Also, the information from this article may be useful to developers who work with other CMS, but also want to get some idea about Beatrix. <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  Recently, I often come across the integration of sites with CRM systems and software for recording the movement of goods and money.  Most often in our country, integration is required with different versions and configurations of 1C.  Also, often, by the time of contacting me, customers either have already created a Bitrix site, or are interested in the possibility of switching to this engine, as 1C recommends it as a system that has everything needed to automate data exchange.  Numerous questions and the accumulated practical experience of working with Bitrix sites became the factors thanks to which I remembered the long-standing promise to talk in detail about Bitrix and still wrote this article.

    <h4>  <b>What is Bitrix?</b> </h4><br>  I propose to begin with the definition of the very concept of Bitrix.  Usually this name is used in two versions: <br><br><ol><li>  Bitrix is ‚Äã‚Äãthe name of the software company. </li><li>  Bitrix is ‚Äã‚Äãa framework for developing web applications, the so-called Bitrix Framework. </li></ol><br><h5>  <b>A bit of history</b> </h5><br>  To begin with, let's talk about the company, in order to understand where the software product ‚ÄúBitrix‚Äù came from and why its name turned out to be like that.  The Bitrix Company was founded back in 1998, immediately after the financial crisis, as a web-studio specializing in custom web-site development.  In the early 2000s, the company creates and begins to develop its own CMS-system, which is also called ‚ÄúBitrix‚Äù.  The first versions of CMS Bitrix did not fundamentally differ from many other site engines until, in 2007, 1C did not buy out the controlling stake in Bitrix, after which the site management system was named <a href="http://www.1c-bitrix.ru/">1C-Bitrix.</a> <br><br>  It is important to understand that after such a merger and a subsequent change in the name of the product occurred at the business and marketing level, i.e.  the companies united, the brand united, and the technical solutions for the most part remained the same - each software product (1C and Bitrix) has its own. <br><br>  Very often, users, focusing on the name and on advertising from 1C, come to the conclusion: if a company uses 1C and seeks to create an online store, then it‚Äôs best to choose the CMS Bitrix, because these are products under one brand and 1C developers also recommend This engine is the best for data exchange with the 1C program. <br><br>  Similarly, and vice versa, if there is an online store on Bitrix and the owner comes to the conclusion about the need to automate sales, then he will most likely choose 1C software products from all the accounting system options. <br><br>  In fact, Bitrix and 1C are different products created by different companies, and the developers of these products work completely independently of each other.  One cannot even say that the developers of 1C are oriented in their work to the needs of Bitrix users, or vice versa, that the developers of Bitrix take into account in their work some innovations from 1C.  And combining the names is only a <b>marketing</b> ploy, admittedly, very successful.  That is, this move can be considered a good move from the marketing side, on the technical side, I cannot give positive examples from the merger. <br><br><h5>  <b>Bitrix as a software product</b> </h5><br>  All Bitrix software products are based on the Bitrix Framework.  If you refer to the help section on the 1C-Bitrix website, you can see the following definition: <br><br><blockquote>  Bitrix Framework is a PHP based web application development platform.  On this platform, 1C-Bitrix has created two popular products: ‚Äú1C-Bitrix: Site Management‚Äù and ‚Äú1C-Bitrix: Corporate Portal‚Äù. </blockquote><br>  This definition is understandable for web developers, but says nothing to users.  And therefore I will try to explain in simple terms what is being said. <br><br>  Framework is a kind of ‚Äúframework‚Äù, a platform for creating software products. <br>  PHP is the programming language in which this "framework" is written. <br><br>  On the basis of this ‚Äúframework‚Äù, this platform, Bitrix has created software products ‚Äú1C-Bitrix: Site Management‚Äù and ‚Äú1C-Bitrix: Corporate Portal‚Äù.  These are ready-made CMS that can be installed on a hosting, set up and work with them, as with any other content management system. <br><br>  From a technical point of view, Bitrix software products (websites and mobile applications) are created based on the Bitrix Framework's own platform. <br><br><ol><li>  Today, these software products are represented by the following solutions: </li><li>  1C-Bitrix: Site Management.  System for creating websites and online stores. </li><li>  1C-Bitrix: Corporate portal.  A platform for creating powerful corporate portals. </li><li>  Mobile applications based on Bitrix Framework (mobile versions of sites, etc.) </li><li>  Various ready-made industry solutions. </li></ol><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/ae7/34e/76a/ae734e76a51a434487e6fb5482196254.jpg" align="left" alt="mobile applications">  In addition, Bitrix supports its own App Store, called MarketPlace, where you can also buy or download various solutions for free, such as templates, additional modules, add-ins for software products, ready-made solutions for connecting telephony, integration with other services, and more. .d <br><br>  The development of software products on the Bitrix Framework platform is carried out by a narrow circle of programmers consisting of company specialists.  This is a commercial product, and therefore such a restriction can be considered an advantage.  Software updates are predictable and understandable, a comprehensive approach is practiced, and new functions usually work exactly as stated. <br><br>  The company also takes a very responsible approach to the work of its store add-ons and MarketPlace applications.  Offer development for this store can not only employees of the company, but also third-party developers.  But any proposed product passes a strict moderation, the solution is tested by specialists of the company ‚ÄúBitrix‚Äù, and only after their approval appears in public access. <br><br>  Of the minuses of this approach, it should be noted that the number of extensions (modules) is much less than for products with a free license, and they are much less diverse.  It is understandable - the number of developers is not limited by the size of the company. <br><br><h4>  <b>What is a "frame"?</b>  <b>More about Bitrix Framework</b> </h4><br>  Bitrix Framework is a certain set of ready-made modules and components, i.e.  "Bricks" from which Bitrix programmers create software products.  In principle, any programmer can use the Bitrix Framework platform to create their own software solutions if they wish, and it is quite possible to modify the finished Bitrix products in the way the user needs. <br><br>  Bitrix Framework is an open source solution, i.e.  the programmer can customize your Bitrix software as you like, there are no restrictions on access to software modules and their code in this system.  But at the same time, Bitrix Framework is a licensed solution.  Those.  You can install and use Bitrix Framework based software products on as many computers as you bought licenses. <br><br>  For comparison: 1C software products also come with licensing, but they can only modify the configuration, the kernel (the basis of the software product) is not available to programmers.  The programmer can make any changes to Bitrix, including the kernel.  And, for example, DRUPAL is an open source system, but without licensing. <br><br>  In order to understand how Bitrix software solutions work, you need to know that each of them consists of a kernel (platform) and add-on modules.  Those.  There is a programming language (php) in which the kernel is written.  Certain features, rules, and tools that a developer can use are created in the kernel.  When creating a software product, the necessary tools are connected and configured; if necessary, the kernel can also be modified.  And when working with a ready-made software product, you can also adjust the platform, but more often it remains inviolable, and modifications are made using various external modules. <br><br>  You also need to take into account that the platform already includes a certain list of basic modules that can be connected or disconnected if necessary.  That is why, for example, in the corporate portal there is a ‚Äúshopping cart‚Äù module, which would seem quite unnecessary there.  But, since it is included in the basic set, it is present in all software products of Bitrix. <br>  Then the user can work with the tools already prepared (moderator, site administrator, etc.), and with their help create content, upload products, and so on. <br><br><h4>  <b>Software Bitrix</b> </h4><br>  Bitrix software products differ from each other mainly by a set of modules that are included in a turnkey solution, and are divided into categories according to the type of site that may be required in this or that case: <br><br><ol><li>  Solution <a href="http://www.1c-bitrix.ru/products/cms/">‚Äú1C-Bitrix: Site Management‚Äù</a> is a software product that is used to develop online stores, business cards sites and similar projects. </li><li>  The <a href="http://www.1c-bitrix.ru/products/intranet/">‚Äú1C-Bitrix: Corporate Portal‚Äù</a> solution is best suited for large companies and for any business where a corporate portal is needed for work. </li><li>  Industry solutions are specialized solutions based on the Bitrix Framework, in which modules are provided for organizing work in a particular industry. </li></ol><br><h5>  <b><a href="http://www.1c-bitrix.ru/products/enterprise/">1C-Bitrix: Enterprise</a> - a solution for large Internet projects.</b> </h5><br>  Also in a separate direction is to allocate the product "1C-Bitrix: Mobile application", which is used to create mobile versions of websites or online stores, as well as other types of applications for mobile devices, which after creation can be laid out for download or sale in the App Store or Google play  This software is also a ready-made platform, thanks to which the creation of mobile applications is much faster and easier than the work of a programmer from scratch. <br><br>  Also, let me remind you once again that any 1C-Bitrix product can be upgraded after purchase at any level, starting from the external modules and add-ons that are familiar to everyone and ending with kernel modifications. <br><br><h5>  <b>1C-Bitrix.</b>  <b>Site management</b> </h5><br>  ‚ÄúSite Management‚Äù is a software product designed to create and manage online stores, business card sites, etc.  There is a huge number of editions of this software, but all of them are intended for one purpose - the creation of a site and its further maintenance (filling, editing, etc.). <br><br>  Initially, "Bitrix" was created as an engine (CMS) for creating online stores, and therefore "Site Management" has a very wide range of features and rich functionality.  On the other hand, the whole wealth of possibilities of this engine is used infrequently.  Rarely, there are several directories on the Bitrix site, marketing opportunities are hardly used, since for most online stores all these functions are not needed, but they are among the features of the software product and you can connect them if you need to at any time. <br><br>  When creating an online store using the site management product, you must: <br><br><ol><li>  Install the ‚Äúengine‚Äù on the hosting; </li><li>  Install the design, set up information pages; </li><li>  Customize the product catalog and basket management (checkout); </li><li>  If necessary, connect payment systems, data exchange with the accounting program, etc. </li></ol><br>  Most of the functionality that may be required to implement any type of online trading is already available as part of the Site Management product, but you can also use your own development or buy solutions in MarketPlace. <br><br>  Important!  System "1C-Bitrix.  Site Management ‚Äùrequires a wide range of hosting capabilities, some hosting companies even introduce special tariff plans for‚Äú online stores on Bitrix ‚Äù, it is important to remember when choosing a hosting and calculating the cost of supporting the site. <br><br><h5>  <b>1C-Bitrix: Corporate Portal</b> </h5><br><blockquote>  Enterprise portal (English Enterprise portal) is, in general, a web-based interface for employee access to corporate data and applications.  Wikipedia </blockquote><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/93b/234/41f/93b23441f46f4b249b144b7c6eb3a1f8.jpg" align="left" alt="Corporate portal">  1C-Bitrix: Corporate portal is a kind of platform where information is collected, the information center of the company.  This is a multifunctional product where you can combine information in a variety of ways.  For example, the company keeps accounting data in 1C.  Accounting, the movement of goods in warehouses and sales - in 1C.  Trade and warehouse, work with potential and real customers - in the CRM-system, technical support is carried out in a specialized customer support service. <br><br>  A corporate portal allows you to conduct all these areas in one place, collect data for management reporting, get a general detailed picture of the company's work from different points of view.  In some ways, the corporate portal Bitrix resembles a Swiss knife: this tool does not have any specialization, but it can be used to perform various actions, since the product contains tools for implementing work with clients, users, and much more, even if at the minimum level. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/32b/558/d1e/32b558d1ea1c41e3a54cac7fccb57cc2.jpg" align="left" alt="Bitrix24">  1C-Bitrix: The corporate portal is also positioned as a product that allows a manager to control the entire workflow of a company, for which various reports are used, a manager can also set functions, for example, start and end working hours, set tasks (projects) for departments, set for They include deadlines and main stages of implementation.  Also CRM-system, telephony, accounting, accounting programs, etc. can be integrated with the portal. <br><br>  There are two products from Bitrix for corporate work: <br><br><ul><li>  Bitrix24 is a SAAS solution, where you pay for access to the ‚Äúcloud‚Äù service.  Here you do not need to pay for your own hosting and professional services, all service updates will be available to you without any action on your part.  But at the same time you can use only the functionality offered by the developer, as well as solutions from MarketPlace.  Own improvements in Bitriks24 impossible. </li><li>  Corporate portal is a software product with a code open for customers, which should be installed on your own hosting after purchase.  All settings for this software product you will need to make yourself.  In order to receive updates, you will need to download them and install them yourself.  But at the same time, your specialists have access to all functions of the software product and any improvements will be available to you. </li></ul><br><h5>  <b>Industry Solutions</b> </h5><br>  Specialized industry solutions are the ‚ÄúSite Management‚Äù system with all the functions available in the basic version, supplemented by pre-installed add-ins for organizing work in a particular industry.  For example, such solutions are very popular for organizing the work of medical institutions, budgetary organizations, educational institutions, etc. <br><br>  There are already special questionnaires for creating a patient's medical card or for registering an entrepreneur, a tax payer, a future property owner, etc.  etc.  Implemented options for a sequence of actions when making an appointment with a specialist, paying a state fee, bills for services, as well as other modules necessary to create a convenient site for a particular industry. <br><br><h5>  <b>1C-Bitrix: Enterprise</b> </h5><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/573/5a8/7de/5735a87defec4d2db461943f2d95792a.jpg" align="left" alt="Bitrix Enterprise">  This solution, designed for the implementation of large and complex projects, is sold at a very high price (from 1,499,900 rubles). Bitrix positions this product as a solution for companies willing to make the most of the Internet and e-commerce opportunities.  The product includes all existing modules and add-ons and the implementation of a wide variety of possibilities that you can imagine.  The developers claim that the product at the same time with a huge number of features also has an incredible degree of scalability and flexibility and guarantee enhanced technical support. <br><br>  Is it worth it to use such an expensive and powerful product, it's up to you.  Some large retail chains successfully work with this solution, others prefer to implement the work on the basis of the usual ‚ÄúSite Management‚Äù functionality.  It all depends on the scale of the project and the demand for the wide range of possibilities that developers offer for the price indicated above. <br><br><h4>  <b>A few words about MarketPlace</b> </h4><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/b1c/1ba/7a2/b1c1ba7a2da547ee9ccaf8cc7f8088af.jpg" align="left" alt="MarketPlace">  If you wish, you can also buy or download ready-made solutions for any of the software products through your own application store 1C-Bitrix MarketPlace.  There are a lot of various templates, solutions for integration with various software products and systems, additional modules for implementing various functions.  These solutions also come with open source, i.e.  If desired, they can be customized for your own needs.  But it is important to understand that after making any changes to the code, technical support for these solutions is not provided. <br><br><blockquote>  Important: the Bitrix core, like the 1C core, also needs to be updated regularly.  Although these updates are not as critical as for software 1C, but there are some nuances here. </blockquote><br>  When updating the core of a software product, any add-ons and applications from MarketPlace may stop working, and therefore after upgrading you will need to re-test these features and, if necessary, download and install updates for them separately.  Also, the update becomes unavailable or problematic if changes are made to the code of the software product. <br><br><h4>  <b>Composite site</b> </h4><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/e43/566/c68/e43566c68ed14162a873f83a637d72b6.jpg" align="left" alt="Composite site">  Composite site is another technology that is actively advertised by 1C-Bitrix developers.  They position composite sites as an opportunity to combine high download speeds with all the features of a modern, dynamic site. <br>  How it works: <br><br><ol><li>  Site pages are divided into static and dynamic parts. </li><li>  To quickly display the static part of the actively used caching. </li><li>  The dynamic part of the system loads in the background and also caches in the browser. </li></ol><br>  The active use of caching allows you to reduce the amount of information that the site sends to the user with each repeated access to the site. <br><br>  Those.  at the first access to the composite site, the usual page loading option takes place. <br>  From the user's browser to the site on the hosting passes appeal.  The site forms the answer, i.e.  full page with all images and other content.  The user waits for all the information to be downloaded to the computer and sees the full page. <br><br>  Composite sites after this most of the page (images, videos, other static information) are stored in the system cache.  And when re-accessed, the presence in the cache of a copy of the static part of the page is taken into account, and therefore only the dynamic part is formed and transmitted, the rest is loaded from the cache.  Due to this, the download speed increases significantly. <br><br><h4>  <b>Usability of products 1C-Bitrix</b> </h4><br>  Software usability Bitrix is ‚Äã‚Äãvery peculiar.  Initially, the developers of ‚ÄúBitrix‚Äù for their CMS used a special approach, in many respects not coinciding with other popular content management systems sites.  The number of features that are incorporated in the software of Bitrix is ‚Äã‚Äãvery large and increases with each release.  And if many other CMS are arranged according to the principle - there is a small and relatively simple core, to which you can connect the most diverse solutions as needed, then Bitrix is ‚Äã‚Äãtrying to put everything and at once into the software product. <br><br>  As a result, there is such a phenomenon as overcoding; in software solutions of ‚Äú1C-Bitrix‚Äù there is too much code and features that are not used most often.  This, in turn, leads to increased complexity of the entire system.  As a result, not only users, but very often even programmers find it difficult to understand the usability of software products and understand where any feature is configured.  Unfortunately, this disadvantage is the reverse side of powerful and multifunctional solutions, which is important to consider when choosing a product to create a website or corporate (joint) work. <br><br><h4>  <b>Summary</b> </h4><br>  The software products of 1C-Bitrix are very powerful modern tools for creating websites, corporate portals and mobile applications.  But we must understand that these technologies are only one of the solutions available on the modern market.  Bitrix has a high level of occurrence and a certain specificity.  So, before making a decision on the use of this or that software product, it is very important to familiarize yourself with various offers on the market, as well as to consult with experts. <br><br>  Besides the advantages listed above, it is also worth noting that the software products and all documentation are Russian-language, as well as the presence of many partner solutions for integrating Beatrix with other systems. <br><br>  The disadvantages are the complexity of software products for users (self-administration of sites is difficult, and setup without the help of experts is almost impossible), and also not the most affordable price. <br><br>  To work or not with these software solutions is everyone‚Äôs personal choice.  I believe that even for integration with 1C, the use of Bitrix is ‚Äã‚Äãnot necessary, there are other methods of organizing data exchange.  On the other hand, for complex and large projects, this powerful system with wide capabilities may be a suitable solution. <br><div style="text-align:center;"> <a href="https://trinion.org/"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/-x/wa/fp/-xwafph06imnlkkgjpvgmp9dguq.png"></a> </div></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/315538/">https://habr.com/ru/post/315538/</a></p>
