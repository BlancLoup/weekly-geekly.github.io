  <section class="page js-page"><h1>News from EA for fans of Sim-games</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Most of you probably remember the game SimCity, beloved by all the years of commercials until 2012. And you probably remember how EA and the developer Maxis almost completely destroyed the opinion of a series of games by its last part SimCity?  It turns out that it cost the studio Maxis a little more than tons of negativity in the press and specialized communities - the studio turned its activities. <br><br>  Frankly, to say that Electronic Arts and Maxis have screwed up with the latest version of SimCity, it would be a far-fetched understatement. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/96e/f81/404/96ef81404be442e6b563e826c0e1ba80.jpg"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  After all, nobody had seen such amazing decisions before: demand the need for a permanent Internet connection for the game, otherwise it will not be able to function, which turned out to be a lie, as it turned out later.  And after that, the company began to threaten beta testers with a total ban for disclosing any bugs and errors.  And after the launch for paid users, the players had to queue for access to the server for about 30 minutes, and many were lucky with such timing.

      The most significant fact of failure, perhaps, was the withdrawal of the game from sale by the giant Amazon, after the release gathered more than 800 negative reviews of the game.  Studio Maxis tried to blame only some of its problems for the game's unpopularity, and after that it took a radical step.  As an apology to the community, the game was offered for free.  But this did not change the course of the Titanic.  The problems continued, because if you need to play through the server and constantly be online, players had the opportunity to destroy the cities of other players.  It was then that EA decided to finish off the battered players with a fee of $ 9 for adding aircraft and balloons to the game. <br><br>  On this minor note, the sales of the game started and did not improve much, showing mediocre performance and did not justify the plans.  Fuel to the fire and rumors poured that with the development of Sims 4 is also not all smooth.  And the final chord was, not so long ago, I read, an analysis of the monetization of the mobile game SimCity Build It released not so long ago.  Unfortunately, the publisher has not reached any records in installations and innovative solutions either. <br><br>  As for the fate of the Maxis studio, yesterday the talks about closing the studio were confirmed by <a href="https://twitter.com/MaxisGuillaume/status/573203901081509888">their designer</a> : ‚ÄúWell, it was a fun 12 years, but it was time to turn off the lights and put the key under the door.  Rest in peace Maxis Emeryville. ‚Äù <br><br>  EA also <a href="http://kotaku.com/ea-shuts-down-simcity-developer-maxis-1689454903">confirmed the</a> closure and studios and the possibility of transferring the creative team of Maxis to other contracting studios to work with new projects. <br><br>  Over the 27 years of its existence, Maxis has worked on more than 30 projects, 11 of which she published on her own, many of which contained a piece of Sim in the title.  The studio gave the players a lot of good impressions both with good old SimCity and with other projects.  I think it‚Äôs quite a shame to leave like this, leaving bitterness and bewilderment among the discussions of ‚Äúthat very release‚Äù.  I hope many people blame not only Maxis studio, but also EA itself for this.  In any case, I want to wish them to reanimate this series and prove that everyone has mistakes, but the experience makes the subsequent products only better. <br><br>  Also, our team offers you to test our VirCities project.  We are not a city planner, but we will soon show our vision of a city dweller simulator. <br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/3da/27d/471/3da27d471fc3492fa23b73d46aabff3a.png" alt="image"></div></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/366425/">https://habr.com/ru/post/366425/</a></p>
