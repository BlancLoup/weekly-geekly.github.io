      But then few people knew that the project would be so global, and everyone was actively working on another project - the Large Hadron Collider.  In 1990, no one ever panicked about such trifles as the destruction of the universe, so everyone worked tirelessly, forgetting about their wives and girlfriends.  And one girl (working as a secretary at CERN) was so tired that her boyfriend completely forgot about her, that she decided to turn his attention by speaking at CERN Hardronic Festival. <br><br>  It should be noted that physicists at CERN can relax and they even have a <a href="http://musiclub.web.cern.ch/musiclub/musiclub.html">recording studio</a> .  What to say about the music festival.  She asked Silvano de Gennaro to write a song to her and performed with her friends.  The cute song was dedicated to the sadness of the girl and her main enemy - the collider.  Such a cocktail and melody made the song a hit among scientists.  After 10 years, they even made a video of it: <br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/1e1eLe1ihT0" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  After the festival, his colleague approached Silvano de Gennaro, [not yet sir] Tim Bernes-Lee, and asked for a couple of photographs of these girls.  Here is what Silvano himself recalls: <br><blockquote>  Back in 1992, after their show at the CERN Hardronic Festival, my colleague Tim Berners-Lee asked me for a few scanned photos of the ‚Äúgirls from CERN‚Äù to publish them in some type of information system that he had just invented called the ‚ÄúWorld Wide Web.  I had only a vague idea of ‚Äã‚Äãwhat it was, but I scanned a few photos on my Mac and uploaded them to Tim via FTP to the now widely known ‚Äúinfo.cern.ch‚Äù.  How could I know that it was a historical moment, and, as described above, that it was the first picture that was ever clicked in a web browser! <br></blockquote><br>  Subsequently, the fate of the team was just as good.  The name was coined - Les Horribles Cernettes, ‚Äúthe ugly girls from CERN‚Äù.  Silvano de Gennaro wrote a few more songs about physics and the life of scientists, so the group was able to call itself "the first and only high-energy rock band."  The team then spoke at many events related to science, and even recorded a ‚ÄúCollider‚Äù CD. <br><br><h4>  Links </h4><br><ul><li>  <a href="http://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/Les_Horribles_Cernettes">Wikipedia article</a> and links to sources (rus); </li><li>  <a href="http://www.cernettes.com/">The official site</a> where you can download songs of the group (eng); </li><li>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/cernettes">YouTube channel</a> (eng). </li></ul></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/47705/">https://habr.com/ru/post/47705/</a></p>
