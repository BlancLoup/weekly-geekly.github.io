  <section class="page js-page"><h1>How to start a career in the gaming industry</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Today, the scale of development of the video game industry is striking even a person barely familiar with this phenomenon.  Still, today there are more than a billion mobile devices in the world, consoles are sold in tens of millions of pieces, and gaming companies earn billions of dollars a year.  The popularity of e-sports events is constantly growing, catching up with major sport events of the "real world" in terms of the number of audiences and passions.  According to the gaming unit Mail.Ru Group, the gaming industry overtook film distribution in the CIS countries in terms of development speed and market volume. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/af9/905/7ea/af99057ea29e423980d6b54477c3e6f7.jpg"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  Work in the gaming industry is not only interesting, but also very profitable.  However, large companies are often looking for experts who have already taken place.  This is what <a href="http://hsbi.hse.ru/person/teachers/sakhnov-konstantin/">Konstantin Sakhnov</a> says about this (teacher of <a href="http://hsbi.hse.ru/programs/vocational_retraining/menedzhment-igrovykh-internet-proektov/">game design at the Higher School of Business Informatics, National Research University Higher School of Economics</a> , Mobile Project Manager for Mail.Ru Group, member of the advisory board of the Web &amp; Tech Ready competition) professionals who can effectively spend money and bring ideas to life. " <br>  Currently, more and more fans of video games are wondering: how to start working in the gaming industry, what do you need to be able to do and where can you learn it?  So where do you start?  First you need to understand that this is exactly what you need.  Many game lovers who are thoroughly aware of the events of the gaming industry, consciously remain ordinary players, clearly demarcating for themselves the boundaries.  If there is a strong implication, an overwhelming desire to create and develop game worlds, to promote and support interesting projects, then most likely this is really your world and you should seriously think about your place in this world.

One of the possible - an experimental way.  Due to the fact that the developers and the administration of game projects in one way or another actively communicate with the users of their product, a real opportunity is created to express themselves and be heard by those who have long and seriously twisted the planet called ‚ÄúThe World of Video Games‚Äù.  Write fashion for your favorite game?  Try yourself in level design?  Have you created, filled and quite successfully developed a fan site?  Have you come up with your own game concept or do you have any ideas how to improve the existing one?  Show your achievements on profile resources, try to get feedback, and the chance that this will start your career in the gaming industry. <br>  Another way, also from the most possible - conditionally academic.  You diligently look for, analyze and assimilate information that strictly corresponds to your plans for the igrostroy, attend profile events, carefully read each interview of gaming industry professionals, study and accumulate their experience in a structured and methodical way.  The gaming industry, which is so vigorously developing and, as a result, in need of professionals, will probably appreciate your aspirations and take you aboard. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/f21/db3/d34/f21db3d344654b9294057efb7b82aa82.jpg"><br><br>  But how to avoid all these "possible"?  Systematically and surely build a career and be realized in your favorite business will help Russia's first state program of professional retraining in the development and management of game projects.  This program is an evening course <a href="http://hsbi.hse.ru/programs/vocational_retraining/menedzhment-igrovykh-internet-proektov">"Management of online gaming projects</a> . <a href="http://hsbi.hse.ru/programs/vocational_retraining/menedzhment-igrovykh-internet-proektov">"</a>  Leading experts from companies with many years of experience in developing online gaming projects and working in the near-game industry are invited to teach.  Including representatives of Mail.Ru Group, Wargaming, Gaijin Entertainment, All orrect, XSOLLA and managers of their own studios.  The program provides knowledge on how to make your own game, having worked the game world to the smallest detail and using actual methods to further promote the game;  how to be able to plan the development of a project, both short-term and strategically;  how to understand the methodology and technical features of the development of game projects on different platforms: mobile, browser and others. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/f2d/fdd/c93/f2dfddc93c8a455f8d0a439a19d88b93.jpg"><br><br>  The program prepares everyone who wants to find a job in existing gaming companies or who want to make their own games.  The program allows you to get the full knowledge necessary to work in the gaming industry.  Upon completion of the program, graduates receive a diploma of the established pattern of the Higher School of Economics.  Graduates close vacancies in the largest companies to develop computer games and create their own studios. <br>  As you can see, the game industry is closer than you think.  If you really want to work in an igrostroy, then no one can hold you back.  Good luck! </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/295094/">https://habr.com/ru/post/295094/</a></p>
