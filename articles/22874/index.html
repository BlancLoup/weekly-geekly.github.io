  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Linux! How much of this word, for the heart of Russian ...</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  I started my acquaintance with a computer with classic DOS.  Agates, Spectra and other evil spirits - so, self-indulgence.  I played with toys, wrote in BASIC ... Yes, yes!  I wrote in BASIC.  I am ashamed now, but then I was young and stupid.  Sorry, I will not!  :-) <br><br>  Okay, a little distracted.  The present study of a computer began with DOS-a and the most wonderful and best book at that time: Figure.  IBM PC for user, edition 4th.  (a mean nostalgic male tear rolled down the admin unshaven cheek, ie, me). <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  It is no secret that the licensed software in the open spaces of the USSR was impossible to get.  Basically.  If it were not for the valiant pirates, then Russia would not be a country of computer geniuses and nuggets.  True then it was not called piracy, but a simple exchange.  Only now it is interesting: what would happen if they pirated software (at that time) cruelly?  The people would simply switch to Unix if they would find a free distribution and enjoy life.  My story is bad and I don‚Äôt remember if there were free unixes in 88?  If so, an interesting question arises: could I start learning Unix then, not many years later?  The correct answer is YES!  I absolutely do not care which command shows directories, ls or dir.  If there is a book like the one mentioned above, I (and millions of people) would read it from top to bottom with the same success, and I would be a sure user in the early 90s. <br><br>  Pirates raised computer literacy in the USSR and Russia, but at the same time planted on a small-sized heroin igloo.  In general, small-scale ones should thank the pirates and sell offtopic at the price of 2 bucks per disc.  Then more people will switch to licensed software, and then the profit will go only from sales.

      When a person ties up with drug addiction, he discovers something he didn‚Äôt notice before drug addiction: butterflies, flowers and just a beautiful life.  Previously, it was familiar, but only plunging into the darkness of eternal fear, pain and the search for a new dose, and coming out of it, a person understands the joy of being.  The same thing with the winery.  While a person is sitting on a Windows, he himself understands that Windows is complete shit, but it is almost impossible to jump off without help.  I myself was not fond of drugs, I sat on the small ones.  But I had the strength to transfer to Linux and feel the thrill of working at the computer.  After Windows, it is easier to change to Unix with packages and guides, than with a console, in which you need to compile gui.  But this is the path to healing. <br><br>  Today at work I spent the whole day in the console.  I had to raise Apache + php + muscle on a solarium 9 There was no access to the Internet, there was no way to download any fakie and hautushki.  I had to read the 700 pages dock bourgeois language.  It is a hymn, especially with imperfect knowledge of the language itself.  It is unusual when completely different keyboard shortcuts work in terminalka ... But I really enjoyed typing commands like: <br>  ps -A | grep httpd | awk '{print $ 1} | xargs kill -9 <br>  One of the admins' neighbors passed by, who works in Unix as needed, but has not yet gotten off the needle of the melkosoft.  I looked at my furious constructions and said that this is no longer cured.  And this is precisely the path to healing! <br><br>  The console is very logical, efficient, concise and beautiful in its own way ... like a Spartan's short sword.  And on the other side of the scale small-scale.  We released the corporate WSUS server to the Internet, it downloaded the updates and then drove it back to the isolated network.  Since it updates automatically rolled on the server and THESE PADLES BEGINNED AUTOMATICALLY TO OVERLOAD !!! <br><br>  What was after the simultaneous overload of both domain controllers, I am afraid to describe.  A server is a solid thing and does not like to fuss.  And if it's a controller, then the download is even longer.  And in office 1,5k yuzvery.  When the database and application servers restarted ... Vaseline began to run out. <br><br>  Logic, efficiency, user care?  Empty sound for one famous company.  Suppose I work on a home machine in the X, but the console window is always open.  It is like a breath of freedom for the prisoner.  Let it not a real UNIX-way.  But looking at the resizable icons in the gnome, repositories, translucent and completely transparent "floating" menus and windows, other graphic features of the Xs, the soul just rejoices and you begin to believe in the final victory of Unix over the abode of evil. <br><br>  I have a lot of friends asking for help on computers and I am glad that in some weeks it is possible to sway ‚Äútry Linux‚Äù even a couple of users.  I will not prevaricate, I will not say that everyone immediately moved to Linux and demolished Windows.  Someone in Linux has stopped loading, someone wants to go to it after configuring all the necessary software.  But I myself have the difference in time, between the disk I was given and the Linus installed at home, as the only system, 5 long years passed. <br><br>  Yes, after installation I had to modify the Linux file.  By default, the kernel occupies a significant place with 256 meg operatives - I had to configure it for my hardware and throw out support for tons of unnecessary technologies.  Not worth Mplayer and I can not listen to mp3, mp4?  This is fixable, the Internet has not been canceled yet.  Slowly work disks after installation: the system is designed to work on any shit, so the mode is gentle.  Type hdparm / sdparm and set the mode that supports your hardware.  It all takes time, but it makes sense. <br><br>  And the automatic restart of the crowd of servers after the installation of the patches, the fucking admins in the server room and the almost empty bucket from under Vaseline - THIS IS NOT LOGICAL !!!  melkosoft - suks, bill gates - Mazda!  :-) <br></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/22874/">https://habr.com/ru/post/22874/</a></p>
