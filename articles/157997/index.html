With a lot of functionality and the web on LAMP - but this has nothing to do with the narration. <br><br>  The previous team managed on a 4-core Xeon in the cloud to get a fantastic collection rate as much as <b>2 pages per second</b> , with <b>100% utilization of the CPU of</b> both the collector and the database on a separate same server.

    <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  <i>By the way, realizing that they do not cope - ‚Äúa team of strong professionals‚Äù from the city of Bangalore gave up and ran away, so that in addition to the source code - ‚Äúnothing!</i>  <i>besides beads ‚Äù(C).</i> <br><br>  On the intricacies of restoring order in PHP and in the database schema let's talk some other time, I will give only one example of the skill that came to us. <br><br><h4>  Getting to the autopsy </h4><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/643/f54/eb0/643f54eb03c6892d1654f6b4ecb042c3.png" alt="image" align="left"><br>  I was interested in such a serious loading of the database in the first place.  I turn on detailed logging - and <s>I start pulling out my hair in all places,</s> here it is. <br><br>  Obviously, tasks from the interface were added to the database, and the robot asked <b>50 times a second</b> - didn‚Äôt a new task appear?  Moreover, the data is naturally decomposed in such a way that the interface is convenient, and not the robot.  The result is three inner join in the query. <br><br>  Immediately increase the interval to "once a second."  I remove the crazy query, that is, I add a new tablet of three fields and write a trigger on the tables from the web, so that it fills with an automatic machine, and I change it to a simple one <pre><code class="sql hljs"><span class="hljs-keyword"><span class="hljs-keyword">select</span></span> * <span class="hljs-keyword"><span class="hljs-keyword">from</span></span> new_table <span class="hljs-keyword"><span class="hljs-keyword">where</span></span> <span class="hljs-keyword"><span class="hljs-keyword">status</span></span> = Pending</code> </pre> <br>  The new picture - the collector is still 100% busy, the database is 2%, now four pages per second. <br><br><h4>  Take up the profiler </h4><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/eeb/4f6/65f/eeb4f665f860dad06e22062735883a1f.png" alt="image" align="left"><br>  And suddenly it turns out that 80% of the execution time is taken up by the wonderful methods <b>EnterCriticalSection</b> and <b>LeaveCriticalSection</b> .  And they are called (predictably) from the standard allocator of a well-known company. <br><br>  <i>The evening ceases to be languid, but I understand that the work - a lot and will have to rewrite from the heart.</i> <br><br>  <i>And of course - <s>parsit</s> HTML <s>bydlokoder</s> my predecessors preferred a bunch of regular expressions, because SAX is so difficult.</i> <br><br>  It's time to get acquainted - and what has been improved to me? <br><br><h4>  On the dangers of premature optimizations by the mental ray </h4><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/7da/e6b/ff7/7dae6bff7d29f9269a982a5c67d6c042.png" alt="image" align="left"><br>  Seeing that the database is 100% loaded, the guys were firmly convinced that the insertion into the list of new URLs for processing was slow. <br><br>  <i>I even find it difficult to understand how they guided, optimizing this particular piece of code.</i>  <i>But the approach itself!</i>  <i>In theory, we are slowing down here, let's slow it down again.</i> <br><br>  For this, they came up with these tricks: <br><br><ol><li>  Asynchronous insert request queue </li><li>  Huge HashMap in memory, self-written, with a giant lock, which memorized all passed URLs in memory.  And since it was a server, it had to be restarted regularly after such optimizations.  They did not finish cleaning their cache. </li><li>  A lot of magic constants, for example - to process the next batch of URLs from the database, no more than 400 entries are taken.  Why 400?  And picked up. </li><li>  The number of "writers" in the database was large, and each tried to cram their part in a cycle, suddenly they were lucky. </li></ol><br>  And of course, many other pearls were available. <br><br>  In general, it was very instructive to observe the code evolution.  The blessing in the store can not refuse - everything is neatly commented out.  That's about <br><br><pre> <code class="cpp hljs"><span class="hljs-keyword"><span class="hljs-keyword">void</span></span> GodClass::PlaceToDB(<span class="hljs-keyword"><span class="hljs-keyword">const</span></span> Foo* bar, ...) { <span class="hljs-comment"><span class="hljs-comment">/*      1,  */</span></span> <span class="hljs-comment"><span class="hljs-comment">/*      2 -     ,  */</span></span> <span class="hljs-comment"><span class="hljs-comment">/*      3 -  ,      ,  */</span></span> .... <span class="hljs-comment"><span class="hljs-comment">/*    N-1,        ,  */</span></span> <span class="hljs-comment"><span class="hljs-comment">//   -   }</span></span></code> </pre><br><br><h4>  What did i do </h4><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/2b8/062/10e/2b806210e9974e97c2688dd572efda9d.png" alt="image" align="left"><br>  Of course, all the tricks were immediately thrown away, I returned the synchronous insert, and constraint was hung in the database to cut the doubles (instead of giant-lock dances and a self-written hashmap). <br><br>  Auto-increment fields are also removed, instead of them inserted a UUID (to calculate the new value, an implicit lock table can crawl).  At the same time, I seriously reduced the table, and then 20K per line - no wonder that the database sags. <br><br>  Magic constants also removed, instead they made a normal thread pool with a common task queue and a separate thread filling the queue so that it would not be empty and not overflowed. <br><br>  The result is 15 pages per second. <br><br>  However, re-profiling did not show breakthrough improvements.  Of course, acceleration is 7 times due to the improvement of the architecture - this is also bread, but not enough.  After all, in fact, all the original shoals remained, I only removed the optimized pieces. <br><br><h4>  Regular expressions for parsing megabyte structured files is bad </h4><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/a6e/1a9/973/a6e1a9973a5ca3d47932c25f117d8037.png" alt="image" align="left"><br>  I continue to study what has been done before me, enjoying the approach of authors unknown to me. <br><br>  <u>Hmmm di!</u> <br><br>  With the grace of the tractor, the guys solved the problem of getting the data like this (each action has its own set of regular expressions). <br><br><ul><li>  Cut all comments in HTML </li><li>  Cut comments in javascript </li><li>  Cut script tags </li><li>  Cut out tags style </li><li>  Take out two numbers from the head </li><li>  Cut everything except body </li><li>  Now we have collected all the "a href" <b>and</b> cut them </li><li>  Body cut out all unnecessary div and table, as well as pictures </li><li>  Then removed the table layout </li><li>  In the rest of the tags removed p, strong, em, i, b, g, etc. </li><li>  And finally, in the remaining plain text, they got three more digits. </li></ul><br>  Surprisingly, with such an approach that it chewed at least 2 pages per second. <br><br>  Obviously, I don‚Äôt give the expressions themselves after their tuning - this is a huge sheet of unreadable ink stubs. <br><br>  That's not all - of course, the correct boost library was used, and all operations were performed on std :: string ( <i>correctly ‚Äî and where else would HTML be added? Char * is not conceptual! Only hardcore!</i> ).  From here comes an insane amount of memory reallocations. <br><br>  I take char * and a simple HTML parser in SAX-style, I remember the necessary numbers, in parallel I pull out the URL.  Two days of work, and here. <br><br>  The result is 200 pages per second. <br><br>  Already acceptable, but not enough.  Just 100 times. <br><br><h4>  Another approach to the projectile </h4><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/945/e9e/b9e/945e9eb9e4e4baf705df7debf364fd41.png" alt="image" align="left"><br>  Moving on to the results of the new profiling.  It has become better, but there are still a lot of allocations, and for some reason the bustov to_lower () has come out for the first time for some reason. <br><br>  The first thing that catches your eye is a powerful URL class, seamlessly drawn from Java.  <i>Well, that's right - this is C ++, it will be faster anyway, think that the allocators are different</i> .  So the stack of copies and substring () is our Hindu everything.  And of course, to_lower directly to the URL :: host should be applied, no - no - it is necessary at every comparison and mention, and by all means boost. <br><br>  I remove the excessive use of to_lower (), rewrite the URL to char * without relocation instead of std :: string.  At the same time I optimize a couple of cycles. <br><br>  The result is 300 pages per second. <br><br>  At that end, acceleration was achieved 150 times, although there were still reserves for acceleration.  And so he killed more than 2 weeks. <br><br><h4>  findings </h4><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/ec4/c53/2b0/ec4c532b0510a318dbe3fd87e48dbbd4.png" alt="image" align="left"><br>  Conclusions as always - a classic of the genre.  Use tools when assessing performance, do not invent from the head.  Shirche (or wider) use ready-made libraries, instead of setting the sun manually. <br><br>  And may <s>Saint</s> Connecty be with you a high performance! </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/157997/">https://habr.com/ru/post/157997/</a></p>
