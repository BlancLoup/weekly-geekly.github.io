      Once we had a story in our company.  Two developers - young and very promising specialists, with big plans and excellent results - decided to prove themselves in the art of hacking.  In other words, they used access to confidential information on one of our projects, discovered a vulnerability and made a purchase with a 50% discount of their own choosing.  The penetration did not go unnoticed by the security services of the project - their CEO called our CEO ... <br><br>  There was a conflict. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Fortunately, our clients are wise and far-sighted people, we managed to smooth out the conflict and continue working on the project.  However, the question of punishing the guilty remained open - the question arose, what does the developer‚Äôs responsibility really mean to the company? <br><br>  Here we want to make a lyrical-legislative retreat.  According to Article 159 of the Criminal Code of the Russian Federation, the story described above falls under clause 3 - fraud committed by a person using his official position, and is punishable by a minimum of 120 thousand, and a maximum by imprisonment of up to 6 years.  Is it worth mentioning that the dismissal under the article will put a big cross on the future career of developers. <br><br>  On the other hand, the company-employer has the opportunity to choose the measure of punishment on its own - from a simple stigma to a very real term.  The degree of financial and reputational losses inflicted on the company has a great influence on this decision - and if you can recover from the first, then you will forget about the second very soon. <br><br>  On the main page of the site of our studio Polonium Arts there is one phrase.  Polonium Arts is the solution of problems, but not the satisfaction of one‚Äôs own ambitions.  At the time of her birth, we did not think that one day she would acquire practical meaning.  Developer's ambitions are great, but you should not allow ambitions to cast a shadow on a company that gives you the opportunity to work and earn. <br><br>  Our story ended peacefully and without unnecessary dramas.  We hope that it will serve as a reminder for developers and their employers that you need to live together and not deceive each other‚Äôs confidence, because even the IT wisdom of Hippocrates is appropriate - do no harm. <br><br>  And now briefly about our new products. <br><br>  The last months were marked by a riot of new projects and ideas, and here are the TOP-3 news to date: <br><br><ul><li>  Our wallet Just.Wallet continues to evolve and is now in the final stages of development.  Read more - in the following posts. </li><li>  We have begun work on the creation of a service for the protection of copyright objects - it will become the first fully automated tool in Russia to combat piracy in the digital space. </li><li>  Work on the social media monitoring service has moved to the layout stage - in one of the following posts we will show screenshots of the new interfaces and tell you more about the principle of operation. <br></li></ul><br>  While this is all, but we do not say goodbye.  You can read other news from the life of the company, see photos / videos on <a href="https://www.facebook.com/payler">our Facebook</a> page.  Further more! <br><br>  With love, <br>  Payler </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/269469/">https://habr.com/ru/post/269469/</a></p>
