Below I‚Äôll touch on the latter, which is most relevant for freelancers. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  <b>There are people</b> whose credibility to any other people is extremely low due to the fact that they were often deceived by <s>nay</s> (maybe even their parents in childhood) - these are rather closed people who find it difficult to trust someone with even small things, not to mention serious and vital things.  I would not advise working with such, if you recognize them, but if you really decide - do not try to increase their credibility, because  spend a lot of nerves and most likely nothing.

      <b>Increasing trust</b> , think about why you need it, because most often these actions are desirable only with long-term cooperation. <br><br>  <i>So...</i> <br><br><h4>  Faster and better </h4><br>  <b>If you say</b> that you make a project, for example, in 7 days, and make it in 5 days and happily inform the client about it - this will certainly place it on you and increase trust as an executive employee, but undermine the credibility of the professional (who clearly expects time) and may cause mistrust of the named dates in the next project for the same customer. <br><br>  <b>The same with the cost of development.</b>  First they called one, and then the other, in order to build / strengthen relations - the result will be similar to the previous one. <br><br>  <b>The optimal solution</b> is to make it just in time, but in addition to offer some free bonuses made with soul (functions in the program, articles or interactive on the site, etc.) that will be difficult for the client to refuse.  And also offer a discount on the next project, and not on this one, so that the customer does not sit on his neck. <br><br><h4>  Conversation with the client </h4><br>  <b>Before the meeting,</b> think that you will be pleased to be around and communicate with this person.  The mood will do the trick.  Also do not forget to find out more about the company / client you will be dealing with. <br><br>  <b>Speak more slowly</b> if you usually do not stop.  In general, try to match the pace of your client's speech, but do not mimic his speech. <br><br>  <b>With low self-esteem: to</b> be confident is not necessary, try to look confident.  Do not fuss, do not rush, walk more smoothly and slowly. <br><br>  <b>If you feel insecure</b> at the time of the negotiations, no supermethods will help you, the only working option is to pause and start talking again, listening to your voice (the sound of your voice soothes).  So you take the initiative in your own hands and start a new stage of negotiations, as it were, which will allow you to smooth out a little the errors of the previous period (for example, got excited, started stuttering, etc.). <br><br>  <b>Try to look not in the eyes</b> , but on the bridge of the nose, occasionally taking a look to the sides, looking at the environment.  <b>Do not look at the floor!</b>  It will create a feeling as if you are guilty of something or in doubt. <br><br>  <b>If the client suddenly changed the topic of conversation</b> and began to talk about what does not apply to the project at all, listen carefully to everything he says to you and try to get at least something close and understandable for you to keep the conversation going.  Do not try to interrupt the client in half a word, forcing him to return to the conversation about the project - let‚Äôs talk.  Believe me, this happens quite often. <br><br>  <b>If besides the main occupation</b> (programming, website development, etc.) you are doing something else (for example: consulting, brainstorming, testing, auditing, etc.) - near the end of the conversation, change the topic yourself and tell about your additional opportunities, skills and resources. <br><br>  <b>In the meantime,</b> tell us about yourself.  Examples: ‚ÄúBy the way, the other day / my son will be born / I bought a car / I am going to overthrow the government ... etc.‚Äù <br><br>  <b>No need to smack.</b>  You can make a little joke.  But it is not necessary!  Example: notice some stupidity / oversight / lack of awareness of the customer and joke about it, even slightly.  People hate it when they are made fools, even in jest. <br><br>  <b>Excessive flattery</b> does not lead to anything good.  But just said a short compliment will increase the credibility of you.  Say the words: ‚Äúgood, fine, excellent, wonderful, etc.‚Äù.  You will create a feeling in a client that he is in the company of a pleasant person. <br><br>  <b>At the end of one of the most important</b> , although many probably know this - do not forget to call the customer as he introduced.  The name that a person represents (not a passport and not on a business card) is a trigger for him.  The more often you call him, the more trust you have and the more you can influence this person. <br><br><h4>  At leisure </h4><br>  <b>Think</b> over your main commercial offer / working conditions / price and quality of services.  How can they be improved to achieve the specific results you need? <br><br>  <b>Try</b> to do some kind of sport, even a morning jog (unfortunately, this is not possible for me yet) - this will allow you to take more open poses, not to cross your legs and arms, to keep your back straight. <br><br>  <b><i>SUPPLEMENT</i></b> : <b>Encourage your customers</b> , who communicate about you to their friends, thereby increasing the number of your customers.  Encourage no money, no flowers, no candy, no books.  Be not banal, but good-natured, resourceful and not stingy. <br><br><hr><br>  <b>I am pleased to</b> comment on your situation or options. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/90600/">https://habr.com/ru/post/90600/</a></p>
