Once the partners sent us a link to the contest.  Then we registered, described the application, passed the interview on the hangout and after checking for several months, the long-awaited letter of happiness came.  It is also worth adding that at the time of writing we conducted training in 10 schools in Moscow, we had a freshly baked video from lessons, the best moments of which were mounted and designed by the <a href="https://geektimes.ru/users/lesnikova/" class="user_link">lesnikova</a> team.  It is also worth adding that the letter came at 01:00 Moscow time, and the dense stream of joy prevented the whole team from falling asleep that day. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/nm1wQq7TDu0%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700022,15700186,15700191,15700248,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhgdN-5U--n0lyFFEJaw7JwC48jBJA" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br><a name="habracut"></a>

      In fact, not so simple.  We have done some work in terms of raising funds.  <a href="http://reachforchange.org/">Filed</a> on <a href="http://reachforchange.org/">ReachForChange.org</a> , which pay 3 years of the RFP to the founders of social projects, but did not pass with the note ‚Äúlack of consistency‚Äù.  We have completed a course of social entrepreneurship from the HSE and the <a href="http://www.nb-fund.com/">Our Future Foundation</a> , we are implementing some of the ideas from the course now.  We went to Yandex, Mail, 1C and not only where we received mostly emotional and methodological support. <br><br><h4>  What is Google RISE? </h4><br>  This is an annual award from the above company, which is awarded in each country.  Russia is already participating a little and before us the St. Petersburg guys received the prize, who make the ScratchDuino training <a href="http://www.scratchduino.com/">kit</a> .  The prize is awarded to projects that promote the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãlearning Computer Sience. <br><br>  It is important to note that this is not only money.  Google helps us organizationally, shares its partners.  This year, RISE also received <a href="http://codeclub.uk.org/">CodeClub</a> , our ideological inspirer from the UK, who needs to learn a ton of experience.  And in May we will go to Boston for the annual summit of RISE recipients from around the world.  In this case, everything will happen in the area of ‚Äã‚ÄãCambridge, where the legendary <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%259C%25D0%25B0%25D1%2581%25D1%2581%25D0%25B0%25D1%2587%25D1%2583%25D1%2581%25D0%25B5%25D1%2582%25D1%2581%25D0%25BA%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B9_%25D1%2582%25D0%25B5%25D1%2585%25D0%25BD%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BB%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B3%25D0%25B8%25D1%2587%25D0%25B5%25D1%2581%25D0%25BA%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B9_%25D0%25B8%25D0%25BD%25D1%2581%25D1%2582%25D0%25B8%25D1%2582%25D1%2583%25D1%2582">MIT</a> is located.  This is not only the place where the first hackers appeared.  But what is important for us is the place where <a href="http://processing.org/">Processing.org</a> was born and where MIT MediaLab, the creators of <a href="http://scratch.mit.edu/">Scratch, are located</a> . <br><br>  We are committed to providing not only a detailed report, but the best practices in teaching children how to code from the global mind. <br><br><h4>  What are we planning to do using this money? </h4><br>  This is part of the sponsorship agreement with Google about our commitments. <br><br><ul><li>  Increasing the number of children's educational institutions of the project partners to 100. </li><li>  Development of teaching aids for the study: <br><ol><li>  visual programming on Scratch and Code.org for junior and high school; </li><li>  Processing (java, python, ruby) for high school; </li><li>  basic web development for high school; </li><li>  basics of robotics (Arduino, Littlebits, quadcopters) for high school. </li></ol></li><li>  Conducting quarterly events to share the experience of volunteer teachers in Moscow and St. Petersburg. </li><li>  Conducting a children's conference on programming and game creation. </li><li>  Conduct All-Russian gamified competition for programming with online and offline stages. </li><li>  Creating a website and conducting a set of communication activities in online media and social media to attract new volunteers and teachers. </li></ul><br><h5>  Little more </h5><br>  First, we need to reasonably invest part of this money in creating a stable cash flow for operating expenses.  How to do this is an open question, now we are entering the stage of experiments.  I'd like to leave everything free for children, but someone has to pay in one form or another. <br><br>  Secondly, we need to systematize the work with those who want to teach.  To do this, we will hold quarterly meetings, the first of which will take place on March 21 at the <a href="http://www.mpgu.edu/">Faculty of Physics and Information Technologies of the Moscow State Pedagogical University</a> on a sports one, which we will write about separately.  We switched to ready-made tutorials on Scratch (thanks, <a href="https://geektimes.ru/users/scratch_book/" class="user_link">scratch_book</a> ) and Processing, so the question is only in those who want and their motivation.  One of the questions that needs to be addressed is how to increase the number of volunteers from 30 semi-passive now to 1000 active until the end of the year? <br><br>  Third, expand the range of courses and raise the age.  Before that, we mainly taught Scratch and Code.org, with a focus on primary school.  Here you want to create interesting programs that are breathtaking.  Although of course you need to solve more pragmatic tasks.  For example, do you know that in some schools, the Lego kits purchased are not unpacked for several years, because there are no programs or can teach them?  In our power to fix it. <br><br>  Fourth, we want to hold a programming forum for children at the end of the year.  Where children will be able to communicate and share their developments, negotiate new joint projects under the supervision of experienced adult developers.  Prehistory for this forum we want to make the All-Russian programming competition.  In contrast to any CUPs, to make the focus an interesting storyline, intriguing tasks, interaction with the real world, and not a trivial solution to speed programming problems. <br><br><h4>  Open partnerships and brainstorming </h4><br>  We want to create an open national non-profit company, where the work of all participants is fairly rewarded, and the participants themselves can influence the goals of the company and the means to achieve these goals, be its equal partners.  We obviously need different people in the project.  Thinking outside the box, for brainstorming and going beyond, strong managers who will help to systematize and scale the project, charged teachers, child psychologists and many others. <br><br>  Reflecting on this, we came up with the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãcreating a direction for open and closed brain storms, where we can solve all the issues related to our development.  Right now we are planning to hold the first such assault.  On the next agenda, how best to use the RISE grant, how best to achieve the goals set for the year, what organizational structure to build in the company. <br><br>  Those wishing to participate in this assault, please pre-register in the comments or in a personal and briefly introduce themselves, so that we can estimate the size of the space where everyone can get together in the second half of March. <br><br><h4>  Children are waiting for us and interesting learning. </h4><br><img width="500" src="https://habrastorage.org/files/4c7/69b/9d0/4c769b9d034f4218a628bc24772a22dd.JPG"><br><br>  With your participation, conditions can be much better :) </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/377305/">https://habr.com/ru/post/377305/</a></p>
