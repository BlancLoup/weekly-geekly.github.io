Grrr ... <br>  I didn‚Äôt want to repeat the attack on the rake, so the Market was opened and the search for a ‚Äúvictim‚Äù began. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/7d9/26d/c62/7d926dc62df143234388787ea2f610c0.jpg" alt="image">

    <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  As a result, the choice fell on TP-Link TL-R480T + - in the most pessimistic version, I received as many as TWO WAN ports, which was quite optimal for me. <br>  It is worth noting that the "+" at the end is not just like that!  Model with and without plus - different things! <br><br>  So, what have the "lucky - no luck"? <br>  TP-Link with this model is perverted for the most unbeatable: not only is there a version with + and without it!  "Plus" released as many as FOUR hardware versions !!!  Guess what they sell in advance is unreal.  Although the box in the store and you can find the version number, but you try to knock out this information from the online store, if the manager does not have the opportunity to go to the warehouse? <br><br>  In short, the difference in versions is: <br>  TL-R480T - stupidly banal router.  1 WAN <br>  TL-R480T + version 1-3 - 2 WAN ports, 3 LAN <br>  TL-R480T + version 4 - from 1 to 4 WAN, from 4 to 1 LAN ... <br><br>  Did it hurt? <br>  The fourth version has 5 Ethernet ports (it is in the photo, but the 6th port is idiocy with a lanyard on the COM port for the console), of which the last one is WAN and LAN, and 3 pieces between them are for the user's choice! <br><br><h5>  Purchase and equipment </h5><br>  The device cost 3000 rubles, it was agreed with the seller that if the version is not 4, I can refuse to purchase.  On the Market, prices start from about 2,700 approximately, but it is still available to find, plus shipping ... <br><br>  In the set it turned out: <br>  Device <br>  A cord with an euro-plug and a standard power connector, like on a computer power supply unit - you can safely connect to any UPS `y! <br>  4 rubber feet. <br>  A bunch of papers and sidyuk, which I did not watch. <br>  Fixture for the rack. <br>  Ethernet cord is short.  VERY short - so, to forward between two adjacent routers at best. <br>  Cord for the console. <br><br>  There are no racks in my house (not yet - a tehnogic brain slowly approaches the idea that it is not the worst option for placing the entire farm), so the fastener went on the shelf, 90% of the notes are warrantees, I suspect that the instructions already managed to download from the off-site ... <br>  Console lace, due to the lack of a COM port, went there too ... <br><br><h5>  Customization and buns </h5><br>  Everything is configured intuitively through the web interface.  We connect the lanyard to the LAN port, go to 192.168.0.1 and ... <br><br>  To begin with, in Network-&gt; WAN / LAN Number, we indicate the number of WAN interfaces.  I put "for the future" all 4 at once! <br>  We press Save and after some thought and restart - we have 4 WAN interfaces!  The hamster is dancing in joy and dancing to the jig, the Toad, who was trying to choke, waving his paw and walking away. <br><br>  On Network-&gt; WAN - select the port number of the WAN, insert the cord from the provider and drive in the settings.  The settings are minimal. <br>  As a minus - you can not call the interfaces in its own way for the memory where what provider. <br>  We save, select the next WAN port, insert the cord of the next provider, drive in the settings ... <br><br>  If the provider is paranoid and it links the account to the MAC address - there is a MAC Clone page: you can set your MAC for each of the WAN interfaces, if you no longer need it, you can return a specific interface to your native MAC.  And what is brilliant is the ‚ÄúYour PC's MAC Address‚Äù field, the ‚ÄúClone You Mac to ...‚Äù button and the drop-down list for 4 WAN: no need to search and copy with pens! <br><br>  On the page Load Balance - you can set the balancing on the machine or manually, as a percentage.  It also shows the current load on the channels. <br><br>  DDNS is also not forgotten: it is presented here by as many as 4 providers, including the eternal DynDNS. <br>  And the beauty is that you can set separately for each WAN port !!! <br><br><h4>  Cons and pros </h4><br><h5>  Minuses </h5><br>  1. I already mentioned the first one - for WAN-ports it is impossible to set a reminder that there is a provider hanging there. <br>  2. Port forwarding, there are Virtual Servers, but the port or range is set the same for the external network and for LAN.  Those.  - mask outside ports for SSH, etc.  will not work. <br>  2.1.  Ports for all external interfaces are set at once: you can make the 80th accessible from network 1, but not from network 2 ‚Äî you can't ... <br>  2.2.  You cannot specify a memo for a range of ports: have you tried to remember at least once a year or two, what were the ports forwarded there ??? <br>  3. There is no ‚Äúfine‚Äù configuration of the router.  But this is someone even a plus. <br>  4. The device is rather large and the laces are sticking out from the front panel: though the execution is rack-mount ... <br>  5. 3 thousand rubles is not one and a half for the DIR-320 ... <br><br><h5>  pros </h5><br>  1. It is adjusted on "one-two-three", settings the minimum. <br>  2. Balancing of ports goes on the machine. <br>  3. WAN settings - through the web interface without a heap of incomprehensible console commands and raising L2TP with cancer through what is not clear. <br>  4. 3000 rubles - not much more expensive than the DIR320 or comp + additional network card multiplied by the heap of dead by the time settings! <br>  5. Unlike DIR320 and Asus 520 - on Beeline I pulled out all my 30 megabits of incoming speed and gave out 60 megabits of outgoing speed!  In the old routers, neither PPoE nor L2TP normally pulled out full speed. <br><br><h5>  Summary </h5><br>  A device for who ‚Äúgo‚Äù is more important. <br>  Yes, you can set up such a routing on a server or on one of the devices with Oleg's firmware, but I never found a normal, FINISHED solution! <br><br>  For myself, I closed the problem of falling channels and now in thought, what else would I attach to the two remaining channels? <br>  The first challenger is MGTS ... </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/131933/">https://habr.com/ru/post/131933/</a></p>
