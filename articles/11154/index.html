And they, allegedly with the help of some super-secret technologies, will bring sites to the very top.  And before that I was curious - what are the latest developments that I decided to study their site.  Something, and I discovered there new products with interest. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  I will cite several quotes with my own comments.

      “The old methods of website promotion and promotion are losing their previous role in website promotion.  The focus has shifted to the unique contextual content. ” <br>  Suddenly. <br><br>  “Unfortunately, how exactly you need to have tags, it makes no sense to write.  Firstly, this is the secret of the company, and secondly, the tactics change all the time, as the search algorithms change. ” <br>  Apparently thanks to a long and expensive research company “Promotion” managed to comprehend the greatest CEO-secret: “How to properly tag”. <br><br>  “Links to your website, located in directories, give an increase in the Thematic Citation Index, which is the main factor in giving out websites for competitive inquiries in the top ten of the search engine“ Yandex ”." <br>  HOORAY!!!  In the furnace, everything else - together we increase the TCI! <br><br>  “In addition, I want to add that our company has 10 departments, 7 of which are directly involved in working on the websites: copywriting department, external promotion, optimization and administration department, design department, usability and quality control department, reinforcement department, quality service department, marketing, technical support, new development department ”. <br>  Division gain.  Tin ... The presence of a quality service department implies that all other departments have poor quality service. <br><br>  “But with the help of automatic registration programs, you can forever part with the dream of promoting the site - search engines strongly condemn this method, and for this you can be on the black list.” <br>  I will drive Olsab all the top 10 on plastic windows.  Will become more spacious. <br><br>  “In order not to get to the blacklist, you must: <br><br>  Do not use automatic recorders. <br>  Do not use secret spam codes and do not post them on the site. <br>  Do not use doorway pages (pages on the Internet that automatically send the user who has logged on to the target site). ” <br>  Ban may be doorway, but not the site to which he refers. <br><br>  “Do not use frequently repeated words on your site in order to get an increase in relevance.” <br>  I will not regret the outgoing link to the main page of their site, in order to demonstrate how this rule is clearly executed by the <a href="http://www.siteprogress.ru/">promoters</a> themselves: <a href="http://www.siteprogress.ru/">www.siteprogress.ru</a> <br><br>  “Do not post automatic directories on the site. <br>  Do not write anything bad about search engines on your website. ” <br>  Let's conduct an experiment: “Vebalta sucks!”.  We are waiting for the ban.  By the way, I wonder why the heart and the mastertalk are not yet in the bath. <br><br>  “Do not put links from your site to sites whose activities are contrary to the laws of the Russian Federation or contain unethical materials.” <br>  If you put a link to a site where unethically expressed obscenities, then your site will go to the ban. <br><br>  “To keep the site in a well-groomed, aesthetically acceptable form and at least once a month, and preferably, make any changes and additions once a week.” <br>  For example, wipe the dust. <br><br>  “If you have already been blacklisted due to the wrong actions of other optimizers, then the“ Promotion ”company will help you to get out of it, but it is not cheap !!!”. <br>  Of course, Plato is not exchanged for small bribes. <br><br>  And here’s about the company's “unique know-how”: <br>  “The point of promoting a website through a business news exchange system is that resources exchange business advertising texts at 115 sites.  This not only increases the citation index (its growth is necessary for the promotion of web sites), but also allows the user to quickly find what he needs.  SONrus is not a standard “link-washer”, but a correct, competent system. ” <br>  The space in the phrase “non-standard” was set in vain - “non-standard link washer” is the most accurate characteristic of the business news exchange system. <br><br>  These are the pros who work in the “Promotion” company. <br><br>  Source: <a href="http://www.seowrite.ru/%3Fp%3D28">Marketing Blog</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/11154/">https://habr.com/ru/post/11154/</a></p>
