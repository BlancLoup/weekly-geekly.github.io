      As you all know, today our company offers the widest range of equipment on the market, which you can easily get acquainted with on our <a href="http://www.lenovo.com/ru">website</a> , and also we love to help interesting and promising projects and sincerely believe that everything will work out, you just have to apply for it some effort.  But it so happens that for the realization of a good idea or a start in life there is not enough just a little bit, just a little bit ... for example, an excellent server. <br>  Is your ambitious project ready to conquer the world, and all you need is just a little help at the initial (or not quite the initial) stage?  Or maybe you have to make a choice on which equipment to build your business, and you are not used to trusting other people's reviews and stories, because you like to check everything yourself? <br><br>  <b>We are ready to give you a server!</b> <br><br>  Absolutely free, without hidden fees and commissions, without small text at the bottom of the 9th page of the thick contract.  The server is provided for your use for several (2-4) months, on the terms of return. <br><br>  All we need from you is: <br><ul><li>  a little story about yourself: who you are, what you do; </li><li>  what goals do you set for yourself; </li><li>  what stage is your ‚Äúproject‚Äù now; </li><li>  for what purposes you need ‚Äúlike air‚Äù our server and what you intend to do with it; </li><li>  understanding that we provide you with one physical server. </li></ul><br><br>  You can send applications now, immediately as you finish reading this text.  Write to us at <a href="">mrakaev@lenovo.com</a> , in the subject line please indicate ‚Äú <i>I want a ThinkServer</i> ‚Äù. <br>  We promise that we will consider and read all your letters.  But, unfortunately, we cannot promise that absolutely everyone will be able to get the equipment.  Also, please note that we give one server in one hand. <br><br>  <b>A small FAQ:</b> <br><br>  <b>How will access to servers be granted?</b> <br>  You will be provided with a physical server (‚Äúin your hands‚Äù). <br><br>  <b>What servers do we offer?</b> <br>  Currently 2 configurations are available: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/327/daf/ddf/327dafddfaec490185a39f4a104c8d22.png"><br>  <a href="http://shop.lenovo.com/ru/ru/servers/thinkserver/racks/rd540/%3Fmenu-id%3Drd540">ThinkServer RD540</a> (2 x Xeon E5-2650v2, 64Gb DDR3, 2 x 300Gb 15K SAS 6Gbps, 4 x 600Gb 10K 6Gbps, LSI 9270CV-8i Controller, 2 x 800W PSU Hot Swap) <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/8ef/af4/995/8efaf4995d394c639ca6f305e7697e84.png"><br>  <a href="http://shop.lenovo.com/ru/ru/servers/thinkserver/racks/rd640/%3Fmenu-id%3Drd640">ThinkServer RD640</a> (2 x Xeon E5-2650v2, 128Gb DDR3, 2 x 100Gb, 2 x 300Gb 15K SAS 6Gbps, 4 x 600Gb 10K 6Gbps, 2 x 500Gb 7.2K 6Gbps, LSI 9270CV-8i Controller, 2 x 800W PSU Hot Swap) <br><br>  <b>Whether the equipment is negotiable?</b> <br>  Yes, at the stage of correspondence.  We will try to choose the most suitable option for you. <br><br>  <b>Who can participate?</b> <br>  Any citizen of the Russian Federation can take part (submit an application), but we will give preference to small projects that have gone out of the ‚Äúidea on paper‚Äù stage and are ready (or already) to be deployed and implemented.  We are looking for those from whom the project is in the debugging stage, those who need a working server to fully test the project ‚Äúin the field‚Äù, those who have not yet decided whether to purchase a completely new server or use the rental services. <br><br>  <b>On what conditions is the server given?</b> <br>  Agreement on temporary use. <br><br>  <b>If we like the server, can we keep it for ourselves by purchasing, for example?</b> <br>  The model that will be transferred to your test is not.  But you can purchase exactly the same from our partners and transparently migrate your project.  We will help you with this. <br><br>  <b>Will you prolong?</b> <br>  We are ready to discuss the extension of the transfer of equipment with each participant individually. <br><br>  <b>And what about support?</b> <br>  For the duration of your work with our server, you will be provided with exactly the same technical and warranty support as the full-fledged customer of our equipment.  So you will have the opportunity to evaluate this side of the coin. <br><br>  Now everything is in your hands.  Remember the slogan of our company - ‚Äú <i><b>For those who do</b></i> ‚Äù. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/250303/">https://habr.com/ru/post/250303/</a></p>
