  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Fujitsu ServerView Suite</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  At any stage of the server life cycle, IT professionals working with it require special tools that save time on various maintenance and monitoring operations.  So, depending on the tasks, tools can be used to perform the installation of operating systems without user support, tools for monitoring the status and management of RAID, monitoring the status of servers and their operating systems, KVM tools, both software and hardware, as well as many other tools and tools. <br><br>  To date, a significant number of both integrated systems for performing the above operations and individual utilities that implement one or two functions are on the market.  One of these integrated solutions to effectively manage the main processes of the server life cycle is the Fujitsu ServerView Suite, which comes bundled with Fujitsu PRIMERGY servers.  It is important that most of the functionality of this package is free and does not require additional costs. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  ServerView Suite improves the flexibility of IT operations, increases their productivity while reducing cost, allows maintaining high server performance and their fault tolerance in 24 √ó 7 operation mode. <br>  All the tools included in ServerView Suite can be divided into several areas or groups: <br><br>  <b>Deploy</b> - tools for operating system deployment and server commissioning; <br>  <b>Control</b> - tools for monitoring and monitoring server status; <br>  <b>Dynamize</b> - means of dynamic administration of server resources; <br>  <b>Maintain</b> - means of maintaining the health and routine maintenance of the server; <br>  <b>Integrate</b> - the possibility of integration with the products of other developers.

      Schematically, these ServerView Suite areas and the functions included in them can be represented as follows: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/b49/468/756/b4946875622e99753811778b012abfe5.png" alt="image"><br><br>  To get a deeper understanding of this package, consider the main functionality of each of the areas. <br><br>  <b>ServerView Suite Deploy</b> <br><br>  This group includes the following components: Installation Manager, Deployment Manager, Scripting Toolkit, Integration Pack for Altiris DS.  With the exception of the Deployment Manager, which requires a separate license, all other products are included with the Fujitsu PRIMERGY servers. <br><br>  <b>ServerView Installation Manager</b> ‚Äî Provides the ability to initially locally or remotely install an operating system (Microsoft Windows, Red Hat, SUSE) or a hypervisor (VMware, Xen) on a server.  Allows you to install operating systems in parallel on multiple servers (up to 5), supports installation without user intervention (unattended), automatically determines the hardware configuration of Fujitsu PRIMERGY servers and installs the appropriate drivers. <br><br>  <b>ServerView Deployment Manager</b> is an additional paid module focused on mass commissioning of servers, which allows you to bypass the limitations of the Installation Manager in 5 parallelly installed servers.  Allows you to save up to 80% of time when deploying data centers. <br><br>  <b>ServerView Scripting Toolkit</b> is a set of utilities for WinPE and Linux (Red Hat and SUSE) that allow configuration of RAID, BIOS settings and iRMC. <br><br>  <b>ServerView Suite Control</b> <br><br>  The main idea of ‚Äã‚Äãthis group of programs is to provide a single fully functional central point of administration.  It is created on the basis of the Central Management Station (CMS) - a separate computer or server (including a virtual one) that hosts special ServerView Operations Manager software that collects information about Fujitsu PRIMERGY servers.  This central administrative software module monitors and analyzes physical and virtual servers and associated infrastructure components.  Based on the roles of users, personnel serving the servers are accessed by the modules providing Server Monitoring, Power Management, Performance Management and Storage Management. <br><br>  <b>ServerView Operations Manager</b> for providing server monitoring functionality (Server Monitoring) provides an overview of all servers and groups created: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/7ec/a33/35d/7eca3335da0c1f74cfe546a2f1fb7daf.png" alt="image"><br><br>  In fact, the server list is the starting point for almost all administrative functions.  From it, you can view one specific system, which will allow you to get information about the selected server as a whole first: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/d43/d43/9b0/d43d439b089a8bad840587f133dd8966.png" alt="image"><br><br>  and then in detail, for each separately selected subsection: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/6ff/d2b/8fd/6ffd2b8fd75abe39ad34c0d518324850.png" alt="image"><br><br>  To ensure timely notification of responsible persons about problem situations, <b>ServerView Event Manager is</b> provided, which is capable of sending notifications by sending special messages via email, SMS, pop-up messages on the administrator's workstation and in other ways.  Event Manager also maintains relevant logs and provides the functionality for creating special scripts that work when certain conditions are reached.  For example, you can customize the launch of any programs under the condition of the triggering of a sensor (trigger). <br><br>  In addition, Operations Manager implemented detection and analysis of pre-failure states (Prefailure Detection and Analysis, PDA) in such server components as processors, RAM, fans, hard drives, and a CMOS battery. <br><br>  Power management capabilities of servers consist in collecting statistics on the energy consumption of servers and their groups, as well as in the possibility of limiting the maximum energy consumption of a server or group of servers.  In the latter case, the server will reduce its performance by reducing the clock frequency or disabling individual processor cores to ensure a set level of power consumption.  This functionality allows you to flexibly distribute energy resources between servers in time and increase the server installation density in racks and data centers. <br><br>  <b>Performance Management</b> monitors the use and utilization of server resources (through the CMS).  In turn, by analyzing such a workload, you can identify both bottlenecks and unused resources, making it possible to carry out the appropriate optimization by migrating certain services or virtual machines from overloaded servers to servers that have free capacity. <br><br>  The <b>storage management</b> functionality is implemented through ServerView RAID Manager, a special program for monitoring and managing the storage systems of the servers being serviced.  It allows you to monitor the status of the disk subsystem, log events, create RAID arrays and manage them through a graphical user interface. <br><br>  <b>ServerView Suite Dynamize</b> <br><br>  This is the only area of ‚Äã‚ÄãServerView Suite, all components of which are paid.  It includes the ServerView Virtual-IO Manager (VIOM) and two editions of the ServerView Resource Orchestrator: Virtual Edition (ROR VE) and Cloud Edition (ROR CE). <br><br>  <b>ServerView Virtual-IO Manager</b> provides I / O virtualization for Fujitsu PRIMERGY servers by virtualizing MAC and WWN addresses, which simplifies the migration of virtual machines from one hardware server to another. <br><br>  <b>ServerView Resource Orchestrator</b> Virtual Edition <b>provides</b> uniform management of virtual and physical servers, while its more advanced version ServerView Resource Orchestrator Cloud Edition allows you to build full-fledged IaaS cloud infrastructures. <br><br>  <b>ServerView Suite Maintain</b> <br><br>  All Fujitsu PRIMERGY servers (with the exception of low-cost TX100 models) have an integrated <b>Integrated Remote Management Controller (iRMC)</b> that provides complete Remote Management (Remote Management) server regardless of its status and location.  It provides access to the server, even if the operating system is not installed, turned off, or hung up.  iRMC has a built-in web server that simplifies receiving and interpreting sensor readings and system events. <br><br>  Advanced features of <b>iRMC Advanced Pack</b> (free of charge included with blades, others need to be purchased separately) provide a redirection of the server‚Äôs graphical and text console, including keyboard and mouse, as well as connecting a remote storage (hard drive, optical drive or USB drive) to the server . <br><br>  <b>ServerView Update Manager</b> allows you to update firmware firmware and BIOS servers, as well as updating drivers and installing ServerView agents as directly on a separate server, and in parallel on a large number of servers.  It has the ability to configure updates on a schedule and servers. <br><br>  <b>ServerView Asset Manager and ServerView PrimeCollect</b> are intended for collecting, storing and processing information about hardware and software of servers.  In addition, ServerView Suite includes <b>ServerView Online Diagnostics</b> , applications that allow testing of RAM, processor, hard disk and optical drive. <br><br>  <b>ServerView Suite Integration</b> <br><br>  The latter group includes the integration capabilities of ServerView Suite into the most common management systems and specialized solutions of other vendors.  In particular, integration into the following products is supported: Fujitsu ManageNow, Microsoft SCCM, Microsoft SCOM, Microsoft SCOM / SCVMM (PRO Pack), HP Operations Manager, HP Systems Insight Manager, Nagios, Icinga, BMC Patrol.  Integration with these solutions is carried out using the appropriate <b>ServerView Integration Packs</b> . <br><br>  <b>Instead of conclusion</b> <br><br>  Above, we looked at the main components included in the Fujitsu ServerView Suite.  The slide below gives an idea of ‚Äã‚Äãtheir distribution by regions, and also displays information about which of them are included in the package and which require the purchase of additional licenses. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/619/171/b24/619171b24685864dad06cf614123ebac.png" alt="image"><br><br>  In general, this package includes a set of tools that allows you to perform almost any tasks that may arise during the installation, configuration and operation of the server.  Thus, ServerView Suite is a key to improving the efficiency of IT services. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/185682/">https://habr.com/ru/post/185682/</a></p>
