Unfortunately, we don‚Äôt yet know the reason for its removal and we were surprised by this, given that the P2P YouTube extension recently passed the test and approval of the Google Chrome Market Administration.  (The mechanism of verification and approval, this is a recent innovation that we encountered when updating it, and which lasted almost a week. Previously, everything was poured and registered on the machine).  In addition, the main expansion feature was to solve problems for users associated with unstable video streaming, which leads to frequent buffering when watching videos on YouTube, as well as providing users with the opportunity to use a more functional player as an alternative to original players based on Flash technologies. or HTML5.  In general, improving the quality of the YouTube service, which also saves their traffic, probably turned out to be not an entirely good idea!  And this is not the case, and frankly, I cannot even imagine what could be the imputed justification for the removal of any popular product that has been in their market for several months and which has recently been tested !? <br><br>  Well, if everything is resolved safely, then in the near future we will make it updated, which will take into account various wishes of users, including its visual part.  The new design of the player has also been prepared, so I will demonstrate some of the skins, since it is still unknown if anyone else will be able to see them in the working extension. <br><br>  <b>Here are some screenshots:</b> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/6cf/f82/dd7/6cff82dd734fb6d83100e33d3a5f0a60.png"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/410/e5c/15c/410e5c15c672ca8ad5a7dc6867d347ce.png"><br><br>  In any case, we are pleased that this extension turned out to be useful for many users, thereby demonstrating the superiority of P2P technology over standard methods, and of course we are grateful to everyone for so many good and useful reviews.  And we assure you that in the very near future, the P2P technology created on the basis of the BitTorrent protocol will not only be the best technology for sharing files, but will also become the best technology for organizing video broadcasts via the Internet, thanks to which you can enjoy truly high-quality Online broadcasts on the most technologically advanced web resources. <br><br>  PS If someone came across a similar situation or understands what could be the reason, we will be glad to hear your interpretation or opinion. <br><br>  We will also be grateful if you provide us with the support addresses from which we can get an answer. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/149292/">https://habr.com/ru/post/149292/</a></p>
