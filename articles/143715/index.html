Thanks to the organizers from GreenfieldProject and Seven Quark, this time we managed to find an excellent place to meet: one of the spacious <a href="http://modmoscow.com/">MOD Design</a> halls.  Very cozy, close to the center, and most importantly, everyone had enough space and was comfortable.  A huge projection screen, clicker for the speaker, delicious coffee during the break, what else is needed for a good meeting. <br><br>  The program included 5 reports: 3 full 20 minutes each and two shortened 10 each, separated by one coffee break.  It is difficult to say how many people came from almost a hundred registered people, 50-60 people, probably, someone did not have time <br>  recover after the holidays.  In the photo hall for 10-15 minutes before the start, then the people still pulled up. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br><h4>  Reports </h4><br>  Alexander Emelin from Mail.ru Group has told about <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/MoscowDjango/class-based-generic-views-django">Class-based generic views</a> .  For those who still do not use views on the classes, we recommend paying attention to them, sometimes they save a lot of boilerplate-code.  For those who actively apply them, a good reference based on the recommendation of Alexander: <a href="http://ccbv.co.uk/">Classy CBV</a> is the replacement of the official confusing and inconvenient documentation for types on classes.  Delivered discussion CBV vs functional views, when it is appropriate to use one or another option and why.

      Vladimir Filonov from WebCanFly told about <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/MoscowDjango/django-12897050">extensible applications</a> .  Using the example of a small part of an online store, we considered various options for implementing an API for connecting plug-ins to django-applications.  In detail, a lot of code, but everything is clear and logical built.  A good report, we think, when developing complex systems with weak component bonding, everyone will have to face something like this. <br><br>  Mikhail Yumatov about statics in Django. <br>  The report could be called <a href="https://github.com/trilan/django-gears">django-gears</a> , since it was mainly about this ambitious library, which is being developed by the guys from Trilan.  It is designed to replace django-compressor and webassets, has most of their functionality, and also stores dependencies directly in css / js (by analogy with <a href="https://github.com/sstephenson/sprockets">sprockets</a> ).  While the application is not yet in production, but this is no less interesting. <br><br>  Ivan Virabyan about <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/MoscowDjango/django-12897658">performance in Django</a> . <br>  For the most part, it was about ORM.  Ivan explained why ‚Äúdb_index = True does not work wonders‚Äù, showed how sometimes the SQL generator can be unpredictable, explained how to use ‚ÄúDefer ()‚Äù, and also described the main approaches to cache invalidation and optimization of the processor context in Django.  The most advanced performance is clearly not for beginners, it‚Äôs a pity that by just 10 minutes, this topic is worthy of a long time frame.  Be sure to look at the slides, a very useful and most applied report. <br><br>  Alexander Shlemin about <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/MoscowDjango/django-android">Django on Android</a> . <br>  The speaker clearly showed that Django is not only about the Web and that it can also be run on mobile devices.  Alexander showed us this on the example of a mobile phone based on Android.  The report caused, probably, the most violent reaction of the audience with laughter and applause. <br>  For those who want to try their hand and put Django on Android, Alexander advises running the <code>manage.py runserver</code> with the key <code>--noreload</code> - this will increase the lifetime of your battery :) <br>  Using the power of root access to the phone and several batteries (to Django), we get access to the list of contacts or databases of other applications.  A standard Django admin panel will show all this data in an acceptable design. <br>  Interaction with the phone's API occurs through the Python driver, so we can vibrate with the phone, write SMS, receive GPS data and even make calls! <br>  In general, for fans of "extreme" programming! <br><br><h4>  Conclusion </h4><br>  Thanks again to the organizers, the guys obviously tried to accommodate all the wishes and made the meeting better than the <a href="http://blog.futurecolors.ru/2012/04/moscow-django-meetup-2.html">previous one</a> .  And of course, the speakers, not dull speeches and topics were relevant. <br><br>  There are plans to hold a Django-Sprint or Django-dash, in general, to look together this summer.  Activists and others are invited to the <a href="http://www.facebook.com/groups/MoscowDjango/">group on Facebook</a> , there is now an active discussion going on. <br><br>  PS We are waiting for the next mitap in a month.  There, one of us will try his hand again behind the microphone at the projector with a report. <br><br>  <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/MoscowDjango/3-moscowdjango-meetup">SlideShare Presentations</a> <br>  <a href="http://www.facebook.com/groups/MoscowDjango/">Moscow Django Facebook Group</a> <br>  <a href="http://moscowdjango.timepad.ru/events">Events on the timepad</a> <br><br>  <i>Ilya Baryshev</i> <i><br></i>  <i>Vitaly Olevinsky</i> <br>  <a href="http://futurecolors.ru/">Future colors</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/143715/">https://habr.com/ru/post/143715/</a></p>
