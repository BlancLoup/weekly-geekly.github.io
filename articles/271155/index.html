No longer beta</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/e3a/31d/2fe/e3a31d2fe16e4cf290bf2d410ec18bb4.png"><br><br>  What is FreePBX?  This is one of the options for controlling the engine of modern IP telephony - Asterisk.  No matter how much integrators like this ‚Äúsuperstructure‚Äù, it is certainly she who is the leader of IP PBX installations. <br><br>  Yes, in some places it is full of holes, not always clear, with a Russification curve, but free.  FreePBX allows you to raise a phone server in an organization to almost any enikee in a matter of hours, and already in the default configuration provides opportunities that will suit almost all companies.  Another thing, if you suddenly lack the functionality of the web interface, and you decide to add some kind of unique feature ... <br>  Crutches, impossibility of a normal debag - here FreePBX will appear in all its glory.

      However, back in March you had the opportunity to test the Alpha version, beta in June, and today I would like to have a quick overview of the final and stable FreePBX 13. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  The company shmooze during 2012 - 2013 confidently moved its product to commercialization.  Free modules suddenly became paid (end point manager, for example), more and more commercial modules were added to their distribution, and after the purchase by Sangoma, the approach did not change, but became even tougher. <br><br>  And what does logung say on the main page of the project?  "Free means Freedom" Not free, but free;) <br><br>  At some point, management decided to share FreePBX only as part of its FreePBX Distro, but later died down.  Today you can build Linux OC + Asterisk + FreePBX yourself, or install a ready-made ISO image of the system directly to the server. <br><br>  So, what is included in the latest at the moment available image 10.13.66-6: <br><br>  FreePBX 13 <br>  SHMZ OS 6.6 (CentOS) <br>  Asterisk 11 or 13 (other versions are not supported) <br>  DAHDI 2.10 <br><br>  The system is installed as usual, in a few clicks.  Remember to choose --no raid if you have multiple hard drives installed.  We, for example, periodically practice installing the system on an SSD of 60 GB, and recording conversations on a neighboring and solid HDD. <br><br>  When the packages are installed, when connected to the network, FreePBX will automatically update its packages to the latest versions from the Sangoma repositories. <br><br>  After installation, the address is assigned automatically (if a DHCP server is raised on the network, of course).  We look at it in the console or DHCP licenses. <br><br>  We get to the server, set the administrator login / password and see the new, rubber system interface. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/f2f/c02/029/f2fc020295104e41ac9157e0a0cf6852.png"><br><br>  And the first innovation that meets us is to close access to the Admin - System Admin section before registering the system on the Sangoma portal.  Neither change the IP address, nor view the list of people who got into Fail2Ban, change TimeZone.  DNS and more. <br><br>  However, the registration is rather short, and you can get a login and password in advance here - <a href="https://portal.schmoozecom.com/">portal.schmoozecom.com</a> <br><br>  As a bonus, you can activate paid modules Extension Routes and Sysadmin Pro for free. <br><br><h5>  Russification </h5><br>  System Interface: Settings - Advanced settings - Show language - YES <br><br>  Voice phrases in the PBX, the commands in the console: <br><br>  mkdir -p / var / lib / asterisk / sounds / ru / <br>  then <br><br>  wget -q --no-check-certificate <a href="https://github.com/pbxware/asterisk-sounds/tarball/master">github.com/pbxware/asterisk-sounds/tarball/master</a> -O- \ |  tar xzv --strip-components 1 -C / var / lib / asterisk / sounds / en / <br>  basic phrases will be loaded, and then <br><br>  wget -q --no-check-certificate <a href="https://github.com/pbxware/asterisk-sounds-additional/tarball/master">github.com/pbxware/asterisk-sounds-additional/tarball/master</a> -O- \ |  tar xzv --strip-components 1 -C / var / lib / asterisk / sounds / en / <br>  At this moment, an extended package of phrases will be loaded, there are more than 700 of them, which covers almost all actions with an asterisk. <br><br>  In the FreePBX interface, go to Admin - Sound Languages ‚Äã‚Äã- Custom languages.  Click the Add button. <br>  Language Code = ru <br>  Description = Russian <br>  Submit. <br><br>  Now, in Global language, Russian will be selected by default.  (at least this is how it happened on my test machine, however, you can choose Russian and click Submit Advanced) <br><br><h5>  Interface FreePBX 13 </h5><br><br>  The web interface of the system has been slightly reworked; it cannot be said that this is a revolutionary change, rather a really useful change. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/78a/87e/348/78a87e34851f4ff18838321303e42a64.png"><br><br>  For example, the user screen is divided into tabs (by connection type), and a button for quick adding users is added. <br><br>  And yes, now you can customize your PBX using a tablet or smartphone, the menu and width will automatically adjust to your screen. <br><br><h5>  Fwconsole commands </h5><br>  Free PBX 13 adds the ability to manage PBX via Linux command line using fwconsole <br>  Amportal will be ‚Äúkilled‚Äù finally in FreePBX 14 <br>  You can see the list of commands below (or type on the fwconsole list server) <br><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">List of fwconsole commands</b> <div class="spoiler_text">  bi this command is used <br>  bulkimport command <br>  chown Change ownership of files <br>  context Shows <br>  cx Shows <br>  dbug stream files for debugging <br>  debug Stream files for debugging <br>  externalip get external ip <br>  extip Get External IP <br>  help Displays help for a command <br>  list Lists commands <br>  m Run a mysql Query: <br>  ma Module Administration <br>  moduleadmin Module Administration <br>  motd prints motd <br>  mysql Run a mysql Query: <br>  r Reload Configs <br>  reload Reload Configs <br>  restart start asterisk <br>  session manage session <br>  set View and update settings <br>  setting View and update settings <br>  sounds Sound Language Prompts <br>  start start asterisk <br>  stop stop asterisk <br>  sysadmin sysadmin functions <br>  trunks Enable and disable trunks from the command line <br>  Unlock Unlock Session <br>  userman user manager <br>  util Common utilities <br></div></div><br><br>  Mix settings via web interface and Linux console commands.  However, it can be useful if you forgot your web administration password or want to re-read configs. <br><br><h5>  System for updating paid modules </h5><br><br>  Another fly in the ointment for FreePBX users. <br><br>  Most of the sold modules of the system were available according to the scheme: purchase of a license for 25 years and 1 year of free update of versions, that is, patches and functional updates.  You use the year, and then pay the developers some extra money, supporting the further development of the module.  Or do not pay and work with the version that you already have. <br><br>  It seems everything is clear and beautiful, if it were not for one thing, there was no extension mechanism in FreePBX, and therefore all this time they provided updates for free.  Now there is, and you can extend the modules directly from the GUI. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/5d7/4c6/45d/5d74c645d0444f22b53b51a77f343a6d.png"><br><br><h5>  Firewall </h5><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/d92/777/c7a/d92777c7a527405b8b176ffa6b2bf814.png"><br><br>  The new module Sangoma Smart Firewall, is already included in the new FreePBX.  To activate it - go to Connectivity - Firewall and click Enable.  Of course, iptables gurus can work wonders, but is this a FreePBX target audience? <br><br>  You can go through the simplest autoconfigurator, and configure the default protection, but you can dig a little deeper and configure the firewall more correctly. <br><br>  Four submenus: About.  Services, Status, Zones. <br>  About - shows information about open ports, launch status <br>  Services - allows you to open / close the service for the previously created network zone <br>  Status - blacklisted list, as well as the list of registered SIP devices. <br>  Zone - network zones that can be trusted.  Indicated with a mask. <br><br><h5>  Conclusion </h5><br><br>  FreePBX 13 - the product is quite fresh, I would not be surprised if the next six months we will see a large number of dopilov and improvements. <br>  Just today, I ran into the problem of a non-working Digium board and I needed a firmware update. <br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">decision, for those who are interested</b> <div class="spoiler_text">  The console issued the following: <br><br>  wcaxx 0000: 03: 00.0: Existing firmware file dahdi-fw-a4b.bin is version b0019, but we require d001e. <br><br>  How to "repair"? <br><br>  From here pull the firmware that she needs <a href="http://downloads.digium.com/pub/telephony/firmware/releases/">downloads.digium.com/pub/telephony/firmware/releases</a> \ <br>  unpacking is valid in / tmp, file 1 is unpacked file dahdi-fw-a4b.bin <br>  then go to / lib / firmware do the old file mv dahdi-fw-a4b.bin dahdi-fw-a4b.bin_back <br>  then the previously downloaded file In my case <a href="">downloads.digium.com/pub/telephony/firmware/releases/dahdi-fw-a4b-d001e.tar.gz</a> <br>  copy from / tmp to / lib / firmware server after this in reboot <br><br>  How to start looking in dmesg, so that everything was ok. <br><br>  [root @ kh ~] # dmesg |  grep -i dahdi <br>  dahdi: Version: 2.10.2 <br>  dahdi: Telephony Interface Registered on major 196 <br>  wcaxx 0000: 03: 00.0: firmware: requesting dahdi-fw-a4b.bin <br>  wcaxx 0000: 03: 00.0: Found dahdi-fw-a4b.bin (version: d001e) Preparing for flash <br>  wcaxx 0000: 03: 00.0: Uploading dahdi-fw-a4b.bin.
