  <section class="page js-page"><h1>WRIO Internet OS. Introduction</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  For those who do not want to read: <br>  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3Dfd-wMXkJxb4">www.youtube.com/watch?v=fd-wMXkJxb4</a>   <br>  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3DDxA6t2kax_k">www.youtube.com/watch?v=DxA6t2kax_k</a> Russian version <br><br>  - Is there any news? <br><br>  The user casually leaned against the wide-open oak door with the webRunes logo and looked incredulously at the old man.  He busily pulled a massive armchair from the shadow of the room to the center of a large and bright sunspot on the floor. <br>  - Yes, it‚Äôs been three years since the publication of the <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/post/165049/">first story</a> - the old man, groaning, squirming in a deep armchair, settling in - ... a bit too much, kh ... But then there is something to tell and even show!  You come in, kind User, do not stand in the doorway.  Pour tea or coffee and sit back, the conversation will take some time. <br>  ‚ÄúAt the beginning of the conversation, it is customary to introduce myself,‚Äù the old man continued, casually taking out a rather thick stack of notes about the knee, ‚Äúbut I will leave this ceremony until the end of our conversation.‚Äù <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  The user shrugged and carelessly drowned in a chair opposite, ready to listen. <br>  - Let's start with the basics. 
      <br>
        <script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>
        <ins class="adsbygoogle"

      <br>
      The narrator narrowed his eyes and stopped short, finally seeing the ‚ÄúHabrahabr‚Äù icon on the visitor‚Äôs pilots.  Quickly selecting the first few pages from above, on one of which the User only managed to catch a glimpse of ‚ÄúWhat is and how the Internet works,‚Äù the old man put them on the edge of the chair. <br>  - So, with the basics finished.  We now turn to the problems of the web.  This is centralized and lack of end-to-end encryption for most sites.  Although the situation with the second has recently begun to improve. <br><br>  The gray-haired man looked at the silent User, who was somewhat taken aback by such an abrupt transition, but after he nodded uncertainly just in case, he continued enthusiastically: <br>  - In addition, all sites are divided among themselves, like rooms in a building.  The user - the narrator looked meaningfully at the interlocutor and at the door behind him - had to walk from one room to another to get the necessary information.  At the same time, in the corridors, symbolizing Internet channels, there are cameras that track all movements.  Tracking states, corporations and social networks, in general, all and sundry. <br><br>  The old man laughed shortly, but then continued: <br>  - Web pages in our analogy are books in the premises-sites, the covers of which personify the UI.  Recently, the weight of such books is mostly a heavy cover with one sheet inside - the data for which the user came.  And he can not transfer them from one room to another, if necessary, use outside the home site, except that in the room there is a window-API providing such functionality.  Finally, we note that some rooms are crammed with advertising, and sometimes there are doors, behind which you can even run into fraudsters or pick up a virus. <br><br>  The gray-haired narrator stopped again, but after his interlocutor nodded once again, showing that he was following the thought, he continued: <br>  - Now imagine another building in which only one huge room filled with shelves-domains that store only pages without a cover.  They have an important difference from the books in the first building: until you open and read them, you will not understand what information they store.  Pages also have tags tags that describe their content.  Even their structure itself, which we will talk about a little later, indicates the type of enumerated data and provides another important property - semanticity.  This allows simple automatic processing, which is especially important for search engines.  But much more interesting is the prospect of creating a recommendation system based on them. <br><br>  Noticing that the focus of the User began to elude, the old man quickly completed: <br>  - In general, if we sum up, in the second case the work of the WRIO Internet OS is described, which we are developing. <br><br>  The user decided to clarify: <br>  - One more time, in one sentence, what is this your ‚Äúlike her‚Äù OS? <br><br>  Grandpa scored more air into the lungs and blurted out with the learned phrase: <br>  - WRIO Internet OS or simply WRIO OS - your window into the world of decentralized, semantic and secure Internet. <br><br>  Then he carefully went through his stack of papers, chose a couple of sheets and handed them over to the User. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/dbb/0a9/373/dbb0a93732235a1ff77a7902d8ead041.jpg" alt="image"><br><blockquote>  Today's typical pattern of user interaction with sites. <br>  website 1: the user's browser sends a request to the site and consistently receives markup (HTML + UI), styles (CSS) and scripts (JS) responsible for interactivity of interaction.  Services often provide third parties with personal user data. <br>  website 2: sites may be under the control of scammers or contain malicious code. <br>  website 3: web resources may be blocked by the provider. </blockquote><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/301/5ab/5e7/3015ab5e775e179e78c4b184f34a2ffe.jpg" alt="image"><br><blockquote>  Semantic Internet. <br>  No separation of sites and the web provides a single interconnected semantic data network. <br>  The data can be encrypted by the user and inaccessible to third parties and fraudsters. <br>  The textual nature of the data excludes the possibility of introducing malicious code under certain conditions (they will be described separately). <br>  The ability to create your own node allows you to bypass the blocking of resources even in the case of blocking the official WRIO node. </blockquote><br><br>  This is a scheme from the book, which can be found at <a href="https://wrioos.com/ru/">https://wrioos.com/ru/</a> .  And although it is only at the beginning of its writing process, the main goal can be taken out of it - the creation of a semantic web that is resistant to blocking and censorship.  In practice, these are <a href="http://json-ld.org/">JSON-LD</a> pages that can be located on any servers, while remaining connected to each other in a distributed, publicly accessible database ‚Äî the concept of <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linked_data">Linked Data</a> .  Each such page is a set of data related to one entity: article, book, song, person, and so on; all the schemes can be found at <a href="https://schema.org/docs/schemas.html">https://schema.org/docs/schemas.html</a> .  Here, for example, looks like the profile page: <br>  <a href="https://aa.wr.io/ru/">https://aa.wr.io/ru/</a> <br>  If you open its source code, you can see that it consists only of minimal HTML markup with headers, directly JSON-LD data and links <br><pre><code class="javascript hljs">&lt;script type=<span class="hljs-string"><span class="hljs-string">"text/javascript"</span></span> src=<span class="hljs-string"><span class="hljs-string">"https://wrioos.com/start.js"</span></span>&gt;<span class="xml"><span class="hljs-tag"><span class="xml"><span class="hljs-tag">&lt;/</span></span><span class="hljs-name"><span class="xml"><span class="hljs-tag"><span class="hljs-name">script</span></span></span></span><span class="xml"><span class="hljs-tag">&gt;</span></span></span></span></code> </pre> <br>  The link leads to one of the WRIO OS nodes and turns the data into a page with additional functionality: authorization, page editor, transfer of donations (a separate large topic), commenting using Twitter and so on.  Each functional has its own separate module built on Node.js + React.  Over time, the user will be able to assemble his own unique set of modules that play the role of today's desktop programs.  Only without the need to install, configure or upgrade, since physically the modules are on the servers of their developers and are connected in one click. <br><br>  No longer need to install CMS and databases, authors can create their own sites with rich functionality simply by saving static pages on their server or third-party services like Google Drive, Dropbox, Github Pages and any other.  An example of such a hub can be found at <a href="https://webrunes.com/">https://webrunes.com/</a> laid out on Github Pages: <a href="https://github.com/webRunes/webrunes.com-WRIO-Hub">https://github.com/webRunes/webrunes.com-WRIO-Hub</a> ;  for the demonstration, we also created a copy of <a href="https://aa.wr.io/ru/">https://aa.wr.io/ru/</a> on Google Drive and placed it <a href="https://a458f256a248aea451381226f009ba4b9e187ee6.googledrive.com/host/0BwI7_FXP53lIbWhRMkVXdmx4M2M/">here</a> . <br><br>  The static nature of JSON-LD provides caching and ease of development of Offline First applications.  Also, the text format is the minimum markup, the absence of CSS, JS, fonts and other things, which ensures a very small page size.  Even voluminous articles easily fit in a few tens of kilobytes, which saves traffic and minimizes load time.  This is primarily appreciated by mobile users. <br><br>  Also, the text format allows you to store and access files via DHT, which opens up new possibilities for creating P2P Internet even without the need for WRIO OS nodes;  for this, however, you will need a blockchain browser, which we will develop later.  It will also allow getting pages from the Dark web networks: Tor, I2P and others, connecting them together.  An ordinary user will not even notice that he now uses the previously closed for most Internet segment. <br><br>  WRIO OS uses <a href="http://ethereum.org/">Ethereum</a> blockchein to register users.  The registration process is the creation of client-side access keys and at the same time are its crypto-wallet.  This approach allows the user to be independent of binding to a specific node, and hacking becomes useless as it does not store any user data.  The book will have a separate large chapter devoted to the protection, preservation of personal data and anonymity. <br><br>  The entire project code is open <a href="https://github.com/webRunes">https://github.com/webRunes</a> and can be used to raise your own node or <a href="https://webrunes.com/ru/">participate in development</a> .  The draft documentation is located at <a href="https://github.com/webRunes/WRIO-InternetOS/wiki">https://github.com/webRunes/WRIO-InternetOS/wiki</a> <br><br>  Under the pressure of information flow, the User only managed to nod automatically and made it several more times before realizing that the narrator had stopped. <br><br>  - Well, now, let me introduce myself. <br>  The old man proudly and threw up his gray head so strongly that the dust, which was floating above him slowly, swept up in the rays of the sun penetrating into the room. <br>  - I am an avatar of IA.  Well ... more precisely, one of them, but the oldest!  And ... wise! <br>  The user was heard in the phrase "supposedly", but he said it very quickly, quietly and to the side. <br>  - What are you avatar? <br>  - IA - Individual Assistant.  The personal assistant - the old man frowned, - By the way, I was already mentioned on Habr√© in <a href="https://geektimes.ru/post/151075/">an interview with Nikolai Gorkav</a> .  I'm still just an idea-abstraction with some mathematical calculations for building individual matrices, and from the code only a set of ‚Äúif A, then B‚Äù scripts, but! <br>  Then he threw up a knotted finger and followed his gaze so meaningfully that the User automatically followed his example, but the finger was already pointing at him. <br>  - I explained my task of explaining to the user, that is to you, - the old man winked conspiratorially - I already fulfill the ideas and goals of the project.  In short, I am interactive ... well, well, I‚Äôll be an interactive help and answers system! <br>  The old man again stretched his index finger upward and already stood up from inspiration, looking somewhere up. <br>  - What for?  - The user blinked uncomprehendingly. <br>  The narrator stopped short, his eyes grew dim and he collapsed back into his chair. <br>  - Well, what for? .. However, - the old man again broke into a smile, once again quickly looked through an impressive stack of his records, chose from it a sheet with a list of questions and handed it to the User - this is a good topic for one of the following stories.  If you want <i>(poll at the end of the article)</i> . <br><br>  - In case of interest, our team is ready to share with the community any technical and / or ideological aspects of the project, without cuts.  Today‚Äôs introductory article only briefly touched on the technical side, leaving behind: <br><ul><li>  a decentralized donate-based rating, which is a content rating based on donation amounts, in contrast to the flat true / false social network likes.  Soon, the ability to create pages based on posts from various social networks with donat functionality will be added. </li><li>  Taglang - tagging system </li><li>  recommendation system based on ranking, tags and user preferences </li><li>  localization of posts and hubs </li></ul><br><br>  like many other features of the system.  The project is really big, and although not much has been implemented, the information has already been collected for a whole book, which consists of five sections: <br><ol><li>  webRunes.  Team history, goals and principles of work </li><li>  WRIO Internet OS.  Semantic Web 3.0 </li><li>  IA - Individual Assistant </li><li>  Alternative </li><li>  Art stories describing the use of the WRIO OS and its place in the world Alternatives </li></ol><br><br>  Already today, in the official hubs of the webRunes team <a href="https://webrunes.com/ru">https://webrunes.com/ru</a> and WRIO OS <a href="https://wrioos.com/ru">https://wrioos.com/ru those</a> interested can find a little more details. <br><br>  <b>ATTENTION: the</b> project is submitted to the court for users exclusively and is at the pre-alpha stage, please do not send any significant amounts if you use the ‚ÄúAdd funds‚Äù functionality, which is currently enabled in test mode. <br><br>  Those who wish to experiment in creating their own hub can take <a href="https://github.com/webRunes/webrunes.com-WRIO-Hub">https://github.com/webRunes/webrunes.com-WRIO-Hub</a> as a basis and edit the pages in any text editor.  Pages can also be created using the <a href="https://core.wrioos.com/%3Fcreate">https://core.wrioos.com/?create</a> editor, however, it is still completely ‚Äúraw‚Äù and only supports basic functionality.  To save, use ‚ÄúSave as ..‚Äù.  Then, as indicated in the story, the page can be put on any server or use services like Dropbox, Google Drive and others. <br><br>  If you have questions or want to join the team, please contact us at <a href="">info@webrunes.com</a> . <br><br>  Thank you for your time and attention! </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/395463/">https://habr.com/ru/post/395463/</a></p>
