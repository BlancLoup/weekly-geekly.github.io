Last month I was absorbed in choosing a laptop.  Occupation it delays and pleases, yet does not begin to bother and irritate.  Finding the right model is quite difficult.  Now a little about my search and a glass about a find. <br><br><img src="http://xmages.net/upload/0fe6d342.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><a name="habracut"></a>

      Life makes you move in space, therefore, the laptop requires lightness and compactness.  But not only.  Still life offers a choice of resource-demanding software, which is problematic to run on a netbook (PhotoShop CS4, Visual Studio 2008, math packages like Matlab, etc.).  The result is the most common problem. <br><br><h3>  Mobility / power / price. </h3><br><br>  Having walked on the Internet, I immediately came across the Sony Z series. Sly Japanese know how to fit high performance in such an elegant case.  But the price for 80 thousand rubles is not for everyone. <br><br>  As a result, the search work began in the average price segment of 25-35 thousand rubles.  Find a model with a good processor is not labor, but immediately discovered a problem with decent graphics cards.  And to refuse to play HD video and games is not very desirable (although it would have been nice to save working time). <br><br>  As the size was chosen diagonal in the range of 13.3 -14.1 inches.  Exclusively for personal feelings less than 13 did not want to. <br>  And now ... hooray)) <br><br><img src="http://img.pixs.ru/storage/2/5/7/IMG0357JPG_4243983_474257.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><h3>  Samsung R480 - JT-02 </h3><br><br>  First, I will briefly list the characteristics so as not to be unfounded: <br><br><table><tbody><tr><td>  operating system </td><td>  Windows 7 Home Premium 32bit </td></tr><tr><td>  CPU </td><td>  Core i5 2260MHz 430M </td></tr><tr><td>  RAM </td><td>  4096 MB DDR3 1066 MHz </td></tr><tr><td>  Display, inches </td><td>  14.0 LED </td></tr><tr><td>  HDD </td><td>  500 GB (5400 rpm) </td></tr><tr><td>  Video card </td><td>  NV GT330M 1024MB </td></tr><tr><td>  Connectors </td><td>  USBx3, VGA (D-Sub), HDMI, LAN, e-SATA, audio in / out </td></tr><tr><td>  Dimensions </td><td>  344 mm / 239 mm / 38.0 mm / 2.30 kg </td></tr></tbody></table><br><br>  More accurate can be found on the Internet. <br><br><h2>  PointFacts. </h2><br><br><h3>  Appearance </h3><br><br>  Koreans are very pleased.  Build quality at altitude.  No squeaks, no rides.  Laptop as forged.  R480 looks quite presentable.  So the aesthetic pleasure of working on it is fully present. <br>  The keyboard is made in the style of Sony / Apple.  But that's not all.  The most interesting is the touchpad.  It is designed by analogy with the touchpad on MacBooks.  The page scrolls with two fingers, rather than a thin strip on the edge of the touchpad.  And it is much more convenient.  Also on the touchpad rendered scaling and rotation of photos.  I only wonder how Samsung got permission to use this feature?  Patent like in Apple collection.  Pradva could be wrong. <br><br><img src="http://xmages.net/upload/4c6865a4.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Separately, I note the layout of connectors.  First of all, everything is fine.  Two nearby USB are at a decent distance.  I am surprised that some manufacturers make USB inputs so closely that only one can be used at a time.  And this is unfortunately quite common. <br>  Secondly, there is e-SATA.  For owners of terabyte external storage is a very nice change. <br><br><img src="http://xmages.net/upload/b6f9959a.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><h3>  Performance </h3><br><br>  Performance is a fairy tale.  I think it will be enough to say that Crysis goes at the maximum resolution of the screen and the shoals are almost imperceptible.  Work programs are loaded in seconds. <br><br>  Here I will write that the battery is not strong, but not weak.  You can surf the Internet, listen to music or watch a movie for 2-3 hours.  It will take about an hour to play at the maximum of opportunities. <br><br>  With all this, the laptop is not as hot as it would seem, and practically does not make noise.  I do not argue that after a couple of months when the laptop is full of dust, overheating may appear along with fan noise.  Wait and see. <br><br>  Regarding the results of benchmarks and other statistics, I can suggest to go to retera.ru.  There I saw a detailed review.  (I hope the chipmunks will not swear at me for this link.) <br><br><h3>  Funny moments </h3><br><br>  Windows 7 is attached to the laptop, which is great.  But the big question is why 32 bit?  The system does not see the 4th gigabyte of RAM, and it is very sad.  So you have to get the 64bit version if you need the 4th gigabyte RAM. <br><br>  Another point that I would like to note is the lack of additional keys.  No player control keys, browser calls, and TP.  Samsung engineers decided to compensate for this with the second key, Fn.  This allows you to adjust the brightness and sound level with one hand.  To my surprise it turned out to be very convenient.  But still control the player is not enough. <br><br><img src="http://xmages.net/upload/399e6663.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><h3>  Total we have </h3><br><br>  Cute little laptop with outstanding configuration and quality build.  All this now costs about 33 thousand rubles.  I do not know about you, but it seems to me that this model has decently raised the bar for mid-size laptops. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/84969/">https://habr.com/ru/post/84969/</a></p>
