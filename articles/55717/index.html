For 45 minutes he played 6 pieces.  During this time, since there was a rush hour, more than a thousand people passed by, most of whom were on their way to work. <br><br>  After three minutes, a middle-aged man turned his attention to a musician.  He slowed down, stopped for a few moments and ... hurried further on his business.

      A minute later, the violinist received his first salary: a woman threw money into a case and, without stopping, continued her step. <br><br>  A few minutes later, the man leaned against the wall and began to listen, but soon he looked at his watch and continued on his way. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  The musician got the most attention from a three-year-old boy.  His mother in a hurry led him behind her, but the boy stopped to look at the violinist.  Mom pulled a little stronger and the boy continued to move, constantly looking back.  This situation was repeated with several other children.  Without exception, their parents did not let them stay for a minute. <br><br>  For 45 minutes of the game, only 6 people briefly stopped and listened, another 20, without stopping, threw money.  Musician's earnings amounted to $ 32. <br><br>  None of the passersby knew that the violinist was Joshua Bell - one of the best musicians in the world.  He played one of the most difficult pieces ever written, and the instrument was the Stradivari violin, worth $ 3.5 million. <br><br>  Two days before the performance in the subway, at his concert in Boston, where the average ticket price was $ 100, was a sell-out. <br><br>  Joshua Bell's playing on the subway is part of the Washington Post's social experiment on people's perception, taste, and priorities.  The principles of which were: in the everyday environment at the wrong moment: Do we feel the beauty?  Will we stop to evaluate it?  Do we recognize talent in an unexpected setting? <br><br>  One of the conclusions from this experiment may be as follows: <br>  If we cannot find time to stop for a while and listen to the best music ever written by one of the best musicians in the world;  if the pace of modern life is so all-consuming that we become blind and deaf to such things - then what else are we missing? <br><br><iframe width="420" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/hnOPu0_YWhw%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700022,15700186,15700191,15700253,15700256,15700259&amp;usg=ALkJrhi_iBfxn5GUkSsfniqkqE-Y3QNW-A" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  PS This is a translation of an <a href="http://www.egodialogues.com/general/violinist-in-metro.php">article</a> based on the <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/04/04/AR2007040401721.html">essay by the Washington Post</a> , which won the Pulitzer Prize.
