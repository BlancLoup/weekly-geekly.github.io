And if you ask any marketer what this content should be, the answer will undoubtedly be: ‚ÄúYou need high-quality content.‚Äù <br><br>  Thank you, Captain!  And, indeed, although it is clear that it is impossible to fill in anyhow with what the site is, it is no easier for anyone.  What is this ‚Äúquality content‚Äù?

      There are many definitions.  I prefer this option: quality content is content that is (1) interestingly written, (2) useful for the reader, and (3) optimized for search engines. <br><br>  I propose to go through these three points and still reveal the secret of quality content.  Go! <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  <i>For a start, a small digression.</i>  <i>Content is, of course, not only articles (and I will talk about them), but also photos, videos, podcasts, infographics, tables, etc.</i>  <i>The basic principles of "quality" for all types of content are the same.</i> <br><br><h2>  Three rules for quality content </h2><br><h3>  Content should be interesting </h3><br>  Even if you need to fill the site for the sale of flower pots in Voronezh, be creative.  Templates no longer work (and indeed, never worked). <br><br>  Instead of long and tediously describing the year in which the company opened, who is the founder, where your quality and inexpensive ( <i>who would doubt</i> ) pots come from, hit the imagination of the target audience. <br><br>  How?  It depends, but reviews, for example, from flowers that have settled in your beautiful pots, fairy tales about flower elves, stories about pots traveling from China, etc. <br><br>  It looks weird, but it is such texts that arouse interest.  Plus, do not forget that (1) the ‚Äúcreative element‚Äù should be included in moderation;  (2) the degree of creativity depends on the target audience.  If your buyer is a solid uncle in a suit, it is not necessary to tell tales about flowers. <br><br>  Not only creativity, but also literacy of presentation makes the content interesting.  And now I‚Äôm not talking about commas and dashes, but about the very manner of presenting the material. <br><br>  Much depends on the target audience, but still try to keep the content free from cliches, stationery, time parasites, verbal amplifiers, extra pronouns, and everything that <a href="http://maximilyahov.ru/">Maxim Ilyakhov</a> calls stop words. <br><br>  For anyone who is not in the subject, I advise you to use the <a href="https://glvrd.ru/">Glavred</a> service from the same Illyakhov.  Find problem areas at times. <br><br>  I repeat: an interesting text is creative, competent and consistent.  Do not give shizu for talent.  Plus, the client site is not a place to advertise postmodern masterpieces. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/92e/7c5/fdf/92e7c5fdf952438489610c5ffdfa1275.jpg"><br><br><h3>  Content should be useful to the reader. </h3><br>  If the content is not useful (read: it does not inform or incline the site visitor to the desired action), then what is the use of keeping it on the site? <br><br>  Alas, but most sites in RuNet are not only boring, but also useless.  It seems that the owners are counting on a miracle ... or still live according to the principle "If necessary, they will still buy."  In short: there are few facts and specifics, a lot of show off and redundant assessments. <br><br>  Honestly, someone is now buying at ‚ÄúYou will buy the best tea from us‚Äù or ‚ÄúTasty and healthy curds from the best domestic producer‚Äù?  I have at least the following questions: <br><br><ol><li>  What is the "best"?  Best for whom?  For the president?  For Aunt Fira from the first floor?  What are the criteria? </li><li>  What is ‚Äútasty and healthy‚Äù?  Who are delicious for?  What exactly is useful?  What kind of domestic manufacturer?  Why is he better than others? </li></ol><br>  I understand, it may seem to be carping.  Most likely, there will even be an argument ‚ÄúWell, everybody does it.‚Äù  But think a minute: if everyone does this, will there be any benefit from such content?  From the type of all these "best", "tasty", "useful", "domestic", etc., the bullshit filter is automatically turned on at the reader.  We are already accustomed not to pay attention to this. <br><br>  What to do?  Focus on the facts, along the way explaining to the reader what problems he solves with the help of your product and why it remains in profit.  It is difficult, but possible. <br><br>  If the content is not prepared by the customer, be sure to insist on filling out the <a href="http://cool-texts.ru/zachem-nuzhen-brif/">brief</a> .  Otherwise, you have to constantly tugging at him with questions. <br><br>  <strong>PS</strong> Separately, I note that useful content is also simple content.  Do not load the reader and do not make him think. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/61b/e74/c76/61be74c766b84d52989c0204e1206a68.jpg"><br><br><h3>  Content must be optimized. </h3><br>  Content may be interesting, and useful, and whatever, but if it is not optimized for search engines and readers, the exhaust will be minimal. <br><br>  So what are the signs of optimized content? <br><br><ol><li>  Readable URL.  Accelerates indexing, easy for the reader to read. </li><li>  Key word with main keyword </li><li>  Relevant keys in the body of the article (especially in the first two paragraphs) </li><li>  Simple language without jargon.  Use the language of the target audience (search engines appreciate it) </li><li>  Optimized images with spelled tags </li><li>  Availability of headings, subtitles, lists, quotes.  The text is divided into semantic parts;  it is easier for readers to perceive information </li><li>  Use short paragraphs and spaces.  Again, it's easier for the reader to scan the text. </li><li>  Relevant internal and external links.  They work as anchors, give access to useful content on the site and on the Internet. </li><li>  Call to action.  An element that allows readers not to think.  Tell them what to do next.  Just do A / B testing to get started. </li><li>  Social buttons.  Content must share.  Think about it in the design and development stages. </li><li>  Comments field.  Required for a blog.  Chat with readers, even if it takes time. </li><li>  Adaptive design.  I think everything is clear. </li></ol><br>  It is important to understand that optimization is not only about SEO, but also usability.  Even if a very good text takes a long time no one will take it.  Practice shows that there are always willing ones, but is it worth relying only on them? <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/02c/be8/4ab/02cbe84ab92e4af19b4b9e7b9b625674.jpg"><br><br><h5>  Let's sum up </h5><br>  Content is a very individual thing.  Secrets, recipes, life hacking, how to generate cool content car and a small cart, and I will tell you why: everything is individual. <br><br>  As there are no identical people, there should not be the same content for different sites.  And companies, and target audiences, and the range, and position in the market - everything is different.  But still there are patterns. <br><br>  Make the content creative and interesting, add life to it, cleaning out the stamps and vulgarity.  Do not forget about the facts and benefits, avoid Ponte and lies.  Optimize for search engines and ordinary people. <br><br>  Everything is not as scary as it may seem.  A bit of creativity + facts + good + real witchcraft = quality content. <br><br>  <strong>PS</strong> If you have interesting resources about content (in English is also suitable) or tools for writing, checking, preparing for publication, etc.  - share in the comments. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/312572/">https://habr.com/ru/post/312572/</a></p>
