Executive Director Larry Page, Google+ has become a strong competitor among social networks, gaining 90 million registered users since its launch in June 2011. <br>  But these numbers are only the tip of what is actually happening with Google+. <br><br>  In fact, Google+ is a virtual ghost town compared to the rival network of Facebook Inc., which is preparing to place shares on the NASDAQ Stock Exchange. <br>  Latest data from research company ComScore Inc.  show that users are registered on the Google+ network, but after that they do not show any activity.

And this data is only for PC users, statistics on the use of social network data from mobile devices was not collected. <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  Starting last year with a new social network in which people could share comments, articles, photos and videos with certain groups of friends and acquaintances, the Internet search giant positioned itself as a rival to Facebook. <br><br>  Google+ has some original features, including ‚ÄúHangouts,‚Äù which allow people to organize video conferences with up to 10 people, but analysts and some consumers say that this is not enough to leave Facebook users and convince them to create a network of contacts from scratch on Google+ . <br><br>  "No one needs another social network right now," said Brian Solis, an analyst for the social media advisory group at Altimeter.  For those who are already using Facebook, ‚ÄúGoogle has not convinced users that their social network has any significant benefits,‚Äù he said. <br><br>  Google management promises to catch up with Facebook, which has 845 million active users, claiming that they are banking on a long-term initiative, and the company has yet to create the tools that have made its competitor successful, including the development of new applications. <br><br>  In an interview, Bradley Horowitz, Google‚Äôs vice president of product management, said: ‚ÄúGoogle+ was not designed as a final site, but as a tool for interaction between users of all the company's products, such as Gmail and Youtube.  In addition, the Google+ platform is designed in such a way that it is extremely difficult for third-party companies to track user activity on it. ‚Äù <br><br>  Mr. Horowitz declined to share data about how much time people spend on Google+, and said that the comScore data is ‚Äúsignificantly lower‚Äù than the company's internal data. <br><br>  Google+ is not yet able to attract a large number of companies to advertise, some marketers say that the number of responses and subscriptions to their products do not meet expectations.  For example, Intel says that it has 360 thousand subscribers on Google+, but Ekaterina Valter is responsible for developing media promotion strategies in the company, says that the ‚Äúuser activity is not as great as we expected‚Äù, and says that on Facebook, Intel has 9 million subscribers and they leave thousands of comments. <br><br>  As David Cohen, Executive Vice President of Universal McCann, said, ‚ÄúAt the moment, Google+ is not as resonant as Facebook or Twitter or even Pinterest‚Äù. <br>  Google has put a lot on the map, the company spends a lot of money on promoting its social network. Oscar broadcasts live, and this is 1.7 million dollars for 30 seconds.). <br><br>  Google+‚Äôs main financial goal is to get personal user data to increase revenue from targeted advertising. <br><br>  The problem of low popularity of Google+ lies also in the fact that Microsoft launched a Google search rival - Bing's own search engine, and also because Facebook and Twitter changed the principle of information search, people no longer use Google as the only way to search for something.  The information on Facebook is still closed to Google and people spend more time on Facebook trying to find what they need. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/139158/">https://habr.com/ru/post/139158/</a></p>
