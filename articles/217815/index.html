  <section class="page js-page"><h1>How to make the coolest site so that all competitors envy</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Of course, without a page on the Internet to live in our time is simply unthinkable.  When the site even has a 24-hour kiosk near the house, and a ten megabyte unlimited amount is held in each dog kennel, any office that respects itself has to make itself known online.  In this article, we will give you some practical tips on how to get a dream site that everyone will envy. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/84e/0e9/05e/84e0e905e274ea6b6c68432ec731c011.jpg" alt="Executive Search"><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Never order a site from major studios and companies with a reputation: it will immediately give you a simpleton and a spender.  Think for yourself: how can some letters on the Internet cost a lot of money?  Surely all the money you paid will go to the golden toilet to the director and the three-story fountain in the lobby of their main office. <br>  Only honest and free workers who declare themselves from pillars, walls of houses and announcements on Avito will give you what you need.  After all, only pure altruists and fanatics of their work can work for such money. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/be3/2cd/1e9/be32cd1e9a6327b98f5707e44608e631.jpg" alt="Technical task"><br>  Remember: the main principle of drawing up competent TK is conciseness.  There is no need to paint all the details and provide unnecessary details.  Ideally, it should consist of one, maximum two sentences;  give your performers an opportunity for self-realization. <br>  ‚ÄúMake a website like Vkontakte, only better, and so many new functions‚Äù - something like this, briefly and firmly, the essence should be stated.  An experienced performer and so has the rudiments of telepathy and is able to anticipate your desires.

Twice them, and when they come to the third, draw a Black Square with small windows with two strokes of a pen on a piece of paper and, after striking the staff with the staff, say: "This should be my website." <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/c14/fbf/ed2/c14fbfed256097553ebb35053051560b.jpg" alt="Communication with the team"><br>  From experience it is known: you should not pay special attention to the advice and opinions of the team.  Everyone knows that they are human programmers who think in binary code and are incapable of a high flight of fancy. <br><br>  State all your wishes and corrections in an artistic language that you can understand.  If you need to do less "medieval" or more "consistent with the spirit of vegetarianism," say so. <br>  On any attempt to protest poke them in the face with a wallet, not forgetting to remind you that you are the pinnacle of this food chain. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/d0a/44e/387/d0a44e38757aa65d19dc8b8ccbe770bc.jpg" alt="Design"><br>  If something can blink, glitter or move, it should blink, glitter and move.  More pictures, flash and animated menus.  The site should be poured as a New Year tree and only by its appearance to introduce the user into a trance.  And I don‚Äôt care that only the NASA supercomputer will be able to pull it, and machines with a RAM less than 2 gigabytes will spark and explode when trying to load it. <br><br>  And even if they do not think to stutter about all sorts of "usability" and optimization: it is clear that this is just another clever way to lure more money from you.  And the word ‚Äúminimalism‚Äù was invented by lazy Jews, just not to work. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/fe3/08b/879/fe308b8796bcecf1fad1373dffb113f4.jpg" alt="Functional"><br>  Everything that the user may hypothetically need should be placed on the main page.  The address of your nearest store in Rostov, the phone number of the junior sales manager, weather reports for yesterday, today and the week ahead, the current dollar rate, the Dow Jones index, an instant chat window with the manager and a suggestion to log in immediately through all imaginable social networks of the world - all this should to decorate the main page of the site, providing unlimited possibilities to the user. <br><br>  In addition, each site must have a holy place - the section "Company News".  There you can post only three things: congratulations to all women clients on March 8, congratulations to all male clients on February 23 and congratulations to customers of both sexes on the New Year.  Everything. <br>  Do not ask why, it is a Tradition.  And God forbid you break it - customers will immediately turn away from you, the waiters will spit you into the soup, and pipes will burst in the office. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/390/edf/040/390edf040ff4b6b3a2ba3e04590054e1.jpg" alt="Promotion"><br>  In the entire history of the Internet, only 17 people reached the second page of search results in Google. <br>  Therefore, it is vital that the link to you hang out somewhere on top for any reason.  It doesn‚Äôt matter if the person is looking for the address of the nearest pharmacy or the latest ‚ÄúDoctor Who‚Äù series, the link to your online store of shoe brushes should proudly hang around his eyes. <br><br>  If you want to promote your website or carry out website promotion and get to the Google top in Moscow, then in order to promote your website cheaply in Moscow, you will inevitably need a high-quality SEO specialist in Moscow in Moscow who will develop the website in Moscow or Moscow Region or will in the top of Google, filling it with text, the syllable of which will envy Kafka and Mandelstam. <br><br>  Do not worry about the fact that only a specially trained robot degenerate can read and understand its essence;  that when you read your main page out loud in the coffin, everything starts to turn, from Dostoevsky to Cyril with Methodius inclusive, and teachers of Russian literature throughout the country still have nightmares for a week after that. <br>  The main thing is the top of Google.  The main thing is the top of Google.  Repeat this phrase as a mantra several times a day, and your life will improve. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/217815/">https://habr.com/ru/post/217815/</a></p>
