This time we will look at the often confusing problem of sizes in the <strong>Flexbox</strong> .  How does <strong>Flexbox</strong> decide how large the elements should be? </p><br><p>  This is the third part of my <strong>Flexbox</strong> series.  In the last two articles, we looked at <a href="https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2018/08/flexbox-display-flex-container/">what happens when you create a flex container</a> , and examined the <a href="https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2018/08/flexbox-alignment/">alignment, how it works in Flexbox</a> .  This time we are going to look at the sizes.  How do we control the size of our <strong>flex</strong> elements, and what choice does the browser make when it adjusts its size? </p><a name="habracut"></a><br><h2 id="ishodnoe-otobrazhenie-flex-elementov">  Original display of Flex items </h2><br><p>  If I have a set of elements that have a variable length of internal content, and set their parent to <strong>display: flex</strong> , the elements will be displayed as a string and line up from the beginning of the main axis.  In the example below, my three elements have a small content size and can display the contents of each element as a continuous string.  At the end of the flex-container there is a space in which elements do not grow, because the initial value of the <strong>flex-grow</strong> property of each element is 0, i.e.  they are forbidden to increase. </p><br><p><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/-g/gy/6j/-ggy6joyfb3mbepxfx4fkdjq1x0.png" alt="Flex elements have a place to display in one line"><br>  Fig_1.  Flex elements have a place to display in one line </p><br><p>  If I add more text to these elements, they will gradually fill the container and the text will begin to be transferred.  Elements are assigned a portion of the container space corresponding to the amount of text in each ‚Äî an element with a longer line of text is assigned more space.  This means that we will not get a tall narrow column with a lot of text when the next element contains only one word. </p><br><p><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/lu/3t/xf/lu3txf4otzieiui_kzx74u_dtty.png" alt="Space is distributed to give more room for a longer element."><br>  Pic_2.  Space is distributed to give more room for a longer element. </p><br><p>  This behavior is probably familiar to you if you have ever used a <strong>Flexbox</strong> .  But perhaps you wondered how the browser does the size calculation, since if you look at several modern browsers, you will see that they all do the same. </p><br><p>  This is due to the fact that features such as this one are worked out in the specification, ensuring that anyone who implements <strong>Flexbox</strong> in a new browser or another user agent knows how this calculation should work.  We can use the specification to find this information for ourselves. </p><br><h2 id="css-specifikaciya-rascheta-vnutrennih-i-vneshnih-razmerov-css-intrinsic-and-extrinsic-sizing">  CSS specification for calculating internal and external dimensions (CSS Intrinsic And Extrinsic Sizing) </h2><br><p>  Looking at something ‚Äî something about calculating dimensions in the <strong>Flexbox</strong> specification <strong>‚Äî</strong> you will rather quickly find that most of the information you need is in another specification ‚Äî <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/css-sizing-3/"><strong>CSS Intrisnic and Extrinsic Sizing</strong></a> .  This is because the concept of calculating the dimensions we use is not unique to the <strong>Flexbox</strong> , nor is the alignment properties unique to the <strong>Flexbox</strong> . </p><br><p>  To find out how the size calculation used in <strong>Flexbox is built</strong> , you need to look at the <strong>Flexbox</strong> specification.  This may seem a bit like jumping back and forth, so I‚Äôll describe here a few key definitions that I‚Äôll use in the rest of the article. </p><br><h3 id="predpochtitelnyy-razmer-preferred-size">  Preferred size </h3><br><p>  <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/css-sizing-3/">The preferred</a> element <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/css-sizing-3/">size</a> is the size determined by the width or height, or by logical aliases of these properties among <strong>inline-size</strong> and <strong>block-size</strong> .  Using: </p><br><pre><code class="hljs css"><span class="hljs-selector-class"><span class="hljs-selector-class">.box</span></span> { <span class="hljs-attribute"><span class="hljs-attribute">width</span></span>: <span class="hljs-number"><span class="hljs-number">500px</span></span>; }</code> </pre> <br><p>  or <strong>inline-size</strong> logical alias: </p><br><pre> <code class="hljs css"><span class="hljs-selector-class"><span class="hljs-selector-class">.box</span></span> { <span class="hljs-attribute"><span class="hljs-attribute">inline-size</span></span>: <span class="hljs-number"><span class="hljs-number">500px</span></span>; }</code> </pre> <br><p>  you declare that you want your block to be 500 pixels wide or 500 pixels in a row. </p><br><h3 id="minimalnyy-razmer-soderzhimogo-min-content-size">  Min Content Size (MIN-CONTENT SIZE) </h3><br><p>  <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/css-sizing-3/">The minimum content size</a> is the smallest content size that can hold an element without overflow.  If an element contains text, then all measures of program transfer must be taken. </p><br><h3 id="razmer-maksimalnogo-soderzhimogo-max-content-size">  Maximum Content Size (MAX-CONTENT SIZE) </h3><br><p>  <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/css-sizing-3/">The maximum content size</a> is the largest content size that an element can contain.  If the element contains text without formatting, it will be displayed as one long continuous line. </p><br><h3 id="osnovnoy-razmer-gibkogo-elementa-flex-item-main-size">  The main size of the flexible element (FLEX ITEM MAIN SIZE) </h3><br><p>  <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/css-flexbox-1/">The main size of a</a> flexible element is its size in the main direction.  If you are working in a string in English, then the main size is the width.  In the English column, the basic size is height. </p><br><p>  Elements also have properties to indicate the minimum and maximum of the main dimension in the main direction, defined as <strong>min-width</strong> or <strong>min-height</strong> . </p><br><h2 id="obrabotka-razmerov-flex-elementa">  Flex Size Processing </h2><br><p>  Now that we have defined some terms, we can see how our flex elements calculate size.  The initial values ‚Äã‚Äãof the flex properties are as follows: </p><br><ul><li>  <strong>flex-grow</strong> : 0; </li><li>  <strong>flex-shrink</strong> : 1; </li><li>  <strong>flex-basis</strong> : auto. </li></ul><br><p>  <strong>Flex-basis</strong> is the base from which the size is calculated.  If we set <strong>flex-basis</strong> to 0, and <strong>flex-grow</strong> to 1, then all of our elements will not have an initial width, so the space in the flex container will be evenly distributed by designating the same size of space for each element. </p><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://codepen.io/rachelandrew/embed/preview/vzaJMW" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><p>  Meanwhile, if <strong>flex-basis is</strong> set to <strong>auto</strong> and <strong>flex-grow: 1</strong> , then only free space will be distributed, i.e.  space without content. </p><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://codepen.io/rachelandrew/embed/preview/XPBejj" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><p>  In a situation where there is no free space, for example, when we have more content than can fit on one line, then nothing is distributed. </p><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://codepen.io/rachelandrew/embed/preview/bxjoeZ" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><p>  This shows us that figuring out what <strong>auto</strong> means is very important if we want to know how <strong>Flexbox</strong> handles the dimensions of our elements.  The <strong>auto</strong> value will be our starting point. </p><br><h3 id="opredelenie-auto-defining-auto">  Define auto (defining auto) </h3><br><p>  When <strong>auto</strong> is assigned as a value to something in CSS, it will have a very specific value in this context that is worth seeing.  The CSS Working Group spends a lot of time figuring out what <strong>auto</strong> means in any context, as explained by <a href="https://vimeo.com/134597090">the conversation</a> with the Fantasai specification editor. </p><br><p>  In the specification we can find information on what <strong>auto</strong> means when used as <strong>flex-basis</strong> .  The terms defined above should help us analyze this statement. </p><br><blockquote>  When specifying the <strong>auto</strong> keyword for a flex element, the value of the <strong>main size</strong> property is returned as " <strong>flex-basis</strong> ".  If this value is <strong>auto</strong> itself, then the value of <strong>content is used</strong> . </blockquote><p>  Thus, if our <strong>flex-basis is</strong> set to <strong>auto</strong> , the <strong>Flexbox will</strong> look at the value of the <strong>main size</strong> property.  We should have a <strong>main size</strong> if we have given one of our flex elements a width.  In the example below, all elements are 110px wide, so this value is used as the <strong>main size</strong> because  <strong>flex-basis</strong> initial value is <strong>auto</strong> . </p><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://codepen.io/rachelandrew/embed/preview/mGjBxQ" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><p>  However, in our original example there are elements that do not have width, which means that their <strong>main size</strong> is <strong>auto</strong> , and therefore we need to go on to consider the following statement: ‚Äúif this value is <strong>auto</strong> itself, then the value of <strong>content is used</strong> .‚Äù </p><br><p>  Now we need to see what the specification says about the <strong>content</strong> keyword.  This is another value that you can use (with browser support) for the <strong>flex-basis</strong> property, for example: </p><br><pre> <code class="hljs css"><span class="hljs-selector-class"><span class="hljs-selector-class">.item</span></span> { <span class="hljs-attribute"><span class="hljs-attribute">flex</span></span>: <span class="hljs-number"><span class="hljs-number">1</span></span> <span class="hljs-number"><span class="hljs-number">1</span></span> content; }</code> </pre> <br><p>  The specification defines <strong>content</strong> as follows: </p><br><blockquote>  Indicates an automatic size based on the contents of the flex element.  (Usually it is equivalent to <strong>max-content</strong> size, but with settings for processing aspect ratios, internal size limits, and orthogonal streams. </blockquote><p>  In our example with flex elements containing text, we can ignore some more complex settings and treat <strong>content</strong> as the size of <strong>max-content</strong> . </p><br><p>  This explains why, when we have a small amount of text in each element, the text is not transferred.  Flex elements have <strong>auto</strong> size by default, so <strong>Flexbox</strong> takes their size in the <strong>max-content</strong> property, elements are placed in a container of this size, and the work is done! </p><br><p>  The story does not end there, because when we add more content, the elements do not remain in the <strong>max-content</strong> size.  If they did, they would break out of the flex-container and cause an overflow.  As soon as they fill the container, the content begins to be transferred, and the elements become different sizes based on the contents inside them. </p><br><h2 id="razreshenie-gibkih-dlin">  Flexible length resolution </h2><br><p>  It is at this point that the specification becomes quite difficult to view, but you need to go through the steps that are as follows: </p><br><p>  First, add up the basic size of all the elements and see if it is larger or smaller than the free space of the container. </p><br><p>  If the size of the container is larger than the sum, then we will take an interest in the <strong>flex-grow</strong> parameter, since we have a place for the growth of elements. </p><br><p><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/bp/ej/rw/bpejrwtqju-w4crwqd2syklzk8k.png" alt="In the first case, our elements have available space for growth."><br>  Fig_3.  In the first case, our elements have available space for growth. </p><br><p>  If the size of the container is less than the sum, then we will take an interest in the <strong>flex-shrink</strong> parameter, since we need to compress the elements to fit into the container. </p><br><p><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/5n/si/sa/5nsisayyjd2wo-p6qhjgpsv8wno.png" alt="In the second case, our items are too large and require compression to fit into the container."><br>  Fig_4.  In the second case, our items are too large and require compression to fit into the container. </p><br><p>  Freeze all unchangeable elements whose dimensions can already be set.  If we use <strong>flex-grow</strong> this will include all the elements that have <strong>flex-grow: 0</strong> .  This is the script that we have when flex-elements have free space in the container.  The initial <strong>flex-grow</strong> value is 0, so they become as big as their <strong>max-width</strong> , and then they no longer grow from their <strong>main size</strong> . </p><br><p>  If we use <strong>flex-shrink</strong> , this will include all elements with <strong>flex-shrink: 0</strong> .  We can see what happens in this step if we give our <strong>flex-flex</strong> set of elements <strong>: 0</strong> .  Elements become frozen in the <strong>max-content</strong> state and therefore do not bend or fit into the container. </p><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://codepen.io/rachelandrew/embed/preview/LJBeWp" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><p>  In our case, with the initial values ‚Äã‚Äãof the flex elements, our elements can be compressed.  Thus, the steps continue, and the algorithm enters a cycle in which it determines how much space to assign or remove.  In our case, we use <strong>flex-shrink</strong> , since the total size of our items is larger than the container, so we need to take away space. </p><br><p>  The <strong>flex-shrink</strong> factor is multiplied by the internal size of the elements, in our case it is the <strong>max-content</strong> size.  This gives value to reduce space.  If the elements only removed the space in accordance with the <strong>flex-shrink</strong> coefficient, then the smaller elements could disappear when all their space would be removed, while the larger element would still have space to compress. </p><br><p>  In this cycle, there is an additional step of checking elements that become larger or smaller than their <strong>main size</strong> , in which case the element stops growing or shrinking.  Again, this is done so that some elements do not become tiny or massive compared to other objects. </p><br><p>  Everything has been simplified in terms of specification, since I have not considered some of the more extreme scenarios, and you can generally just think, assuming that you are happy to let <strong>Flexbox</strong> do its thing.  Remember that in most cases the following two facts will work. </p><br><p>  If you grew from <strong>auto</strong> , then <strong>flex-basis</strong> will either be handled like any width or height of an element or <strong>max-content</strong> size.  Then the space will be removed in accordance with the <strong>flex-basis</strong> size multiplied by the <strong>flex-shrink</strong> factor, and, therefore, is removed in proportion to the maximum size of the elements. </p><br><h2 id="kontrol-rosta-i-szhimaniya">  Growth and contraction control </h2><br><p>  I spent most of this article describing what the Flexbox does when it is left on its device.  Of course, you can control more of your flexible elements using flex properties.  They hopefully seem more predictable with an understanding of what is happening behind the scenes. </p><br><p>  By setting your own <strong>flex-basis</strong> or by giving the element itself a size that is then used as a <strong>flex-basis</strong> , you return control of the algorithm, telling the <strong>Flexbox</strong> that you want to grow or shrink from that particular size.  You can completely disable growth or compression by setting the <strong>flex-grow</strong> or <strong>flex-shrink</strong> parameter to 0. At this stage, however, you should temporarily use the desire to control the flex elements to check whether you are using the correct layout method.  If you are trying to align flex elements in two dimensions, you'd better choose a grid layout. </p><br><h2 id="voprosy-otladki-svyazannyh-razmerov">  Issues related to debugging related sizes </h2><br><p>  If your flex elements end in unexpected sizes, this is usually because your <strong>flex-basis</strong> is <strong>auto</strong> , and there is something that gives the element width, which is then used as a <strong>flex-basis</strong> .  Checking an item in <strong>DevTools</strong> can help determine where the size comes from.  You can also try setting <strong>flex-basis</strong> to 0, which will force the <strong>Flexbox to</strong> treat the element as having zero width.  Even if this is not the result you want, it will help determine the value of <strong>flex-basis</strong> in using your size problems as the culprit. </p><br><h2 id="flex-zazory">  Flex clearances </h2><br><p>  The highly demanded feature of the Flexbox is the ability to specify gaps or gutters between flex elements in the same way that we can specify gaps in a grid layout and a layout with several columns.  This feature is defined for <strong>Flexbox</strong> as part of <strong>Box Alignment</strong> , and the first implementation of the browser is on the way.  <strong>Firefox</strong> expects to supply <strong>gap</strong> properties for Flexbox in <strong>Firefox 63</strong> .  The following example can be viewed in <strong>Firefox Nightly</strong> . </p><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://codepen.io/rachelandrew/embed/preview/NLBEKG" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><p><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/qt/ms/al/qtmsal2-lgxm3ijhz6ucmomp55i.png" alt="As the image is seen in Firefox 63 browser"><br>  Pic_5.  As the image is seen in Firefox 63 </p><br><p>  As with the layout of the grid, the gap length is taken into account before the allocation of space for <strong>flex</strong> elements. </p><br><h2 id="zavershaya">  Completing </h2><br><p>  In this article, I tried to explain some of the nuances of how <strong>Flexbox</strong> handles the increase in <strong>flex</strong> elements.  This may seem a little abstruse, however, taking some time to understand how this works can save you a lot of time using <strong>Flexbox</strong> in your layouts.  I find it very useful to come back to the fact that, by default, <strong>Flexbox</strong> tries to give you the most reasonable layout for a variety of elements with different sizes.  If an item contains more content, it is given more space.  If you and your designer do not agree with what <strong>Flexbox</strong> considers best, you can regain control by setting your own value for <strong>flex-basis</strong> . </p></div>
