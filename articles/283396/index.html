And it is often at this stage that the first misunderstanding arises between customers and performers, which translates into further conflicts and leads to a breakdown of the deadlines.  To avoid this, the task director must master the ‚Äúphrasebook of the developer‚Äù in order to understand how the developer thinks and how to convey the value of the task to him. <br><br>  In our division there is a whole methodology of setting tasks, we call them specifications.  The new manager should familiarize himself with this methodology in order to speak the same language with the team.  To master this art is easy enough even for a person without a technical education.  The first stage in our methodology is to state the essence of the problem, as if you are telling it to a seven-year-old schoolboy.  I believe that this is the cornerstone in the formulation of the problem: to be able to explain the essence of the problem in simple language, so that it is understandable to a person with any level of training.  In addition, at this stage it is important to fix the goal of the task - which metric will change and why it will happen.  This approach allows you to eliminate mutual misunderstanding in a team and create a common motivation to achieve the goal. <br><br>  One of the main mistakes that managers make is not to explain the value of the task.  This came to us from the management of the 20th century, where the task, in essence, is an order that is not negotiable and is mandatory for execution.  Because of this, developers lose their motivation, begin to consider managers as bullies and relate to the task execution formally.  It is a formal attitude to the task - our main enemy.  We try not to allow situations where the developer uses the excuse ‚Äúthere are no complaints about buttons‚Äù.  The main principle that is confessed in our team is the transfer of maximum responsibility to the performers.  For this, it is important to involve developers at the stage of specification development, so that they feel they are involved in a common goal, and also indicate possible technical limitations. <br><br>  I think that this course will be of interest to both managers and developers.  The first will be useful to learn the basics of understanding between the customer and the performer.  I repeat, a well-formulated task is the key to the high motivation of the developer to accomplish it and achieve a common goal.  For developers, this course will also be useful, because programming is a team discipline that requires constant interaction with developers from other projects.  Sooner or later, any developer must put his first task to his colleagues, and in order for it to be solved successfully, you need to know the basics of setting the tasks that are set out in this course. <br><br>  <b>Roman Novikov</b> , My World project manager </blockquote><br><h4>  <b>Restart courses</b> </h4><br>  In addition to the new course, we finalized the previously launched programs and reopened the recording on them.
