  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Reflections on the nature of laziness :)</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  I often wonder if we always justifiably reproach ourselves and others for laziness?  And more and more I come to the fact that this quality inherent in almost everyone has been given to us for good. <br>  Laziness for our mental "I" is practically the same as pain for the "I" of the physical. <br>  If a person did not feel pain, it would hardly be a great happiness for all of us.  First of all, pain is protection against self-destruction.  I remember an article about a three-year-old girl who did not feel pain.  She cut her hands and watched the blood spread with interest;  she grabbed the iron and, with bated breath, also watched the skin become charred.  Unfortunately, I don‚Äôt know how her fate developed, but such facts are scary.  Pain is necessary because  it signals that something harmful is happening to the body. <br>  More and more I am convinced that the similar situation is true for the ‚Äúscourge of humanity‚Äù - laziness.  It not only protects us from overwork, being a kind of regulatory mechanism for work and leisure.  She to some extent suggests the correct life path.  It makes you break away from the routine, evaluate what is happening, think about whether we need what we are working hard for.  Studies show that more than half the work of workaholics is a waste of effort, work for work, a means to avoid idleness. <br>  For myself, I still highlight such a type of laziness as ‚Äúlaziness is intuitive.‚Äù  For example, while studying at university, sometimes I experienced, just terrible laziness at the thought of preparing for some exams or seminars - in 99% of cases they either broke down, or did not ask me, or released me.  And thanks to such ‚Äúintuitive laziness,‚Äù I released time for something really interesting or useful.  Now the same thing at work.  If something is very lazy to do, I try to postpone it until the deadlines - and after a while the bosses, as a rule, declare that the task is canceled :) <br>  And then there is the lazy "lazy", with which we must definitely fight.  Yes, it‚Äôs not always necessary to indulge your laziness.  Sometimes you have to go through it, grow over it. <br>  Again the analogy.  Learning to play the guitar, we experience terrible pain in the fingertips: but you can‚Äôt stop exercising, you need to endure this pain until the skin at your fingertips looms (those who studied will understand me).  Having started to do fitness, after a while we lose the former interest in classes and laziness appears: but if we strive for the chosen goal (a healthy and harmonious body), we need to exercise through ‚ÄúI do not want‚Äù for some time. <br>  Let's discuss on the topic of laziness - is it always necessary to fight it, and if not, then how to distinguish between ‚Äúuseful‚Äù and ‚Äúlazy‚Äù laziness :) <br>  Dear IT gurus, waiting for your comments, suggestions, tips, stories :) </div>
