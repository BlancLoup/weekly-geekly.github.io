  <section class="page js-page"><h1>About ratings and in general, just a few words</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  In recent days, people have offered 5 (two on the site and 3 in habrakpochte) options for new user ratings.  In all cases, the initiative was shown by users registered in the fall, i.e.  in the last two months. <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  It seems to me that with the growth of the site‚Äôs audience, the flow of such offers will only increase.  In October, we grew by 3 times in traffic, and the flow of proposals for improving the system increased by about the same amount.  In this connection I want to say once and for all: <b>we listen carefully to all the proposals</b> .  Thank you so much for this!  But please note: if you are not answered, it does not mean that you wrote some garbage that was left unattended.  Please also note: <b>no one will change the system just because someone wanted to change the rules of the game</b> .  No need to push, no need to ask the same question about the rating several times a day.  Have patience.  All heard, all visible.  We carefully read and analyze everything. <br><br>  I can close my eyes and name users who were able to pump themselves without help, within the framework and rules of the existing system.  To do this, do not even need to light a cigarette and lead long conversations.  This is my iron argument in the direction of those who claim that the system is "inadequate and biased."  Before you make such statements, you need to study the resource thoroughly, but it is practically impossible to do: Habrahabr will always be an incomprehensible resource, it will always need to be studied, because the system contains different things that, depending on the atmospheric pressure on the site, can behave differently.

      Okay, even if the system is all so bad, it can't mean that it needs to be changed urgently.  <b>All changes will be implemented deliberately.</b>  No need to bomb the editorial letters and 25 times a day to offer to alter the system and give concessions to those who, for various reasons, other users pointed to a minus.  If you indicated a minus, then there was a reason in the minus.  She could not appear out of nowhere.  All actions on the site are made intelligently, the content of the meaning can be anything, it all depends on the specific user. <br><br>  Believe me, we very clearly see what is happening inside.  To do this, do not need glasses old grandmother, who went crazy and became engaged in aerobics, like everyone else.  Without them, holes and shortcomings of the system are clearly visible, nothing is perfect and can not be.  But we aim!  Habrahabr is changing every day, its functionality is constantly improving, we add different new things, and this will continue until we realize that the system can live without us. <br>  Please note: the <b>current system is sharpened by users who create content</b> .  She will be sharpened by them always.  Because it was created for them.  Most of the first page of the rating is regularly written in texts or blogs.  They are for us the most valuable people.  We love them very much.  The system is sharpened for them, this is our intention. <br><br>  I very much hope that next week we will introduce a reward mechanism, all revenues from contextual advertising will accrue to users, but don‚Äôt ask about this anyway, I won‚Äôt say anything until the time comes. <br>  I also think that what is happening is more and more like a game in which SEOs and search engine developers are involved.  The latter are struggling with the tricks of the first, apparently, we also have to fight.  But this struggle will be in the interests of users.  A system has been created for them. <br><br>  It seems the game has already begun? <br><br>  ps We all love you very much!  You are good.  -) </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/518/">https://habr.com/ru/post/518/</a></p>
