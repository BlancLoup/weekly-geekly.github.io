  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Overview of the popular crypto airdrop platforms</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Overview of the TOP 5 popular platforms with a selection of free tokens to distribute.  Airdrop is a free distribution of tokens to everyone (of course, to a limited extent).  They can be aimed at promoting a completely new coin (which is not yet on the exchanges, and only the preliminary sale of tokens is carried out).  In addition, token developers can distribute free coins to current cryptocurrency holders in a certain proportion (for example, charging 10% of the amount of coins lying on the wallet). This allows the token to be popular in a short time, to attract more investors' capital. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/kk/1b/pg/kk1bpgtd6o6a1l1xcoibfzuunvw.png"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br><h2>  <a href="https://cocoricos.io/airdrops%3Futm_source%3Dhabr/">Cocoricos.io</a> </h2><br> <a href="https://cocoricos.io/airdrops%3Futm_source%3D4/"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/cx/ds/kb/cxdskb53decflg-dtfownxjt2oa.png"></a>

    <h3>  Status </h3><br>  The <a href="https://cocoricos.io/airdrops%3Futm_source%3Dhabr/">Cocoricos.io</a> domain is 11 months old, but the list of airdrops was presented only on October 31, 2018. Although this site is relatively young, it still deserves a mention because of the new features and convenience for users. <br><br><h3>  Functionality </h3><br>  Cocoricos platform allows you to perform all tasks, including google forms, directly through the platform.  You can do it manually or speed up the process by linking your accounts with a Cocoricos account.  To learn more about the projects, you can click on the name of the desired airdrop. <br><br> <a href="https://cocoricos.io/airdrops%3Futm_source%3Dhabr/"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/se/1i/xk/se1ixkur2yj7u0mstf4btiy0xhe.png"></a> <br><br>  Each airdrop has a link to the site with a brief description of the project, videos and important information about tokens and airdrops.  On the project tabs you can find links to the necessary information, such as the white paper, the command, the roadmap and other useful links.  The design is pleasant and greatly accelerates the study of tokens. <br><br><h3>  Airdrop rating </h3><br>  The Cocoricos team analyzes each project, before adding it to the platform, this means that only quality projects are presented on the site. <br><br><h3>  Social Media Alerts </h3><br>  Cocoricos.io promotes new airdrops on its pages on <a href="https://twitter.com/bycocoricos%3Flang%3Den">Twitter</a> , <a href="https://www.instagram.com/bycocoricos/">Instagram</a> , <a href="https://t.me/bycocoricos">Telegram</a> and <a href="https://www.facebook.com/bycocoricos/%3F__tn__%3DkC-R%26eid%3DARDncA-0GZNS_NWGb3ezVwGVQC33VyOgJ3XtBLT8B6bfK2s9Oj173NH1lo9pOIM7yvvuF1WZF4OdAx4G%26hc_ref%3DARQk0eDqRrYBGtGo7D7-iE3JF_Qr0jV4IXJPw2t_6UAiAuMcoaKRvNgCca0huCpXfJQ%26fref%3Dnf%26__xts__%255B0%255D%3D68.ARDHB9FlxnV6OnviFu2DHPrloVEht7KfSrgjFiZjXKXiOyZIOHofbXfd8hndXmarde8QoWLfMywdn-LBbj3p07YQD7_O1KD8ouJX8kJaejSDtkYvINPA7Dc9mV3MyRJV1Gej3TgxSrdN3TR0jCwDI_LlLEE8wm8zC2Zd7mCoQV8LVegL7I94wJDTmdrs7lYY-qcfeYL_0xWIaabWZnDkJklk">Facebook</a> , <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Cocoricos/">Reddit</a> , <a href="https://bitcointalk.org/index.php%3Ftopic%3D5060778.0">Bitcointalk</a> . <br><br><h3>  Brief conclusion </h3><br>  <b>Pros</b> : The platform allows you to link accounts and perform airdrop tasks directly from the main page of the site to save your time as much as possible.  Pages with airrops provide additional information and links to technical documents, project details and the team. <br><br>  <b>Cons</b> : Relatively new and unverified platform. <br><br><h2>  Airdrops.io </h2><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/md/xc/xo/mdxcxofxgw2bmpl8sawm-s3suh8.png"><br><br><h3>  Status </h3><br>  <a href="https://airdrops.io/">Airdrops.io</a> is one of the most popular sites for Airdrop fans.  The domain age is 1 year and 2 months, but activity on the site began only in March 2018.  Since then, the popularity of the site has grown to about 17.5 thousand visitors per month (according to statistics from <a href="https://ahrefs.com/blog/seo-metrics/">Ahrefs</a> ). <br><br><h3>  Functionality </h3><br>  The website includes airdrops lists, where all active airrops are placed, which are divided into 3 groups - hot, new and exclusive.  In each airrop profile you will find information that includes the name, the estimated cost of the token, the rating of the tokens (in degrees Celsius) and a description. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/yp/zk/a7/ypzka7v1wvyykplovnfhtbhprik.png"><br><br>  After you click on airdrop, you will be taken to a special page with detailed information and a step-by-step explanation of how to register and fill out the forms to receive airdrop.  Below you can find the white paper of the project and useful links. <br><br>  The website Airdrops.io will help you find the right links to the airdrops forms and indicate where you can see the tasks you need to complete.  The task execution function is not available from the main page and is not associated with your accounts, with the exception of tokens that are in the ‚Äúexclusive airrops‚Äù section. <br><br><h3>  Airdrops rating </h3><br>  Airdrops.io allows all users to evaluate the ‚Äúlevel of attractiveness‚Äù of all airrops.  Voices are visible as a temperature scale in degrees Celsius, next to the project names. <br><br><h3>  Social Media Alerts </h3><br>  Airdrops.io promotes airdrops through its social pages on <a href="https://twitter.com/airdrops_io%3Flang%3Den">Twitter</a> , <a href="https://twitter.com/airdropalert%3Flang%3Den">Twitter Airdrop Alert</a> , <a href="https://t.me/airdrops_io">Telegram</a> and <a href="https://www.facebook.com/airdrops.io/">Facebook</a> , <a href="https://reddit-marketing.pro/">Reddit</a> . <br><br><h3>  Brief conclusion </h3><br>  <b>Pros</b> : Airdrops.io is an excellent catalog of all recently submitted airrops, categorized into Hot, Latest and Exclusive.  The site has a good UX and allows visitors to rate the airrops. <br><br>  <b>Cons</b> : Information about airdrops is quite small.  You still have to do all the tasks and fill out the forms manually. <br><br><h2>  AirdropKing.io </h2><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/md/xc/xo/mdxcxofxgw2bmpl8sawm-s3suh8.png"><br><br><h3>  Status </h3><br>  <a href="https://airdropking.io/">Airdropking.io</a> is a relatively new site (the domain is 8 months old) with the first activity registered in April 2018.  Currently, Airdrop King receives about 7.9 thousand visitors per month. <br><br><h3>  Functionality </h3><br>  The home page of the AirdropKing.io platform contains a simple list of airrops with basic information, such as name, rating, estimated cost of airrops, the remaining days until the end of the campaign, and a list of actions necessary to perform airrop tasks and get free tokens. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/93/u_/5d/93u_5ddhctvsowyv2yagzeypoys.png"><br><br>  As soon as you click on the airdrop you are interested in, you are redirected to a simple page with the necessary campaign information and instructions on how to get free tokens. <br><br>  The project page also contains a rating from the AirdropKing.io team, but it does not contain links to the evaluated items, as well as to the team and the White Book.  You must search for them yourself on the token site. <br><br><h3>  Airdrops rating </h3><br>  AirdropKing offers an assessment of the concept of token projects, web site, team and White Book.  Unfortunately, the criteria for such an assessment are not specified.  Airrops are rated on a website from 1 to 5 stars.  But with proven airdrops, the ratings were incompatible with the ratings of popular rating sites ICO. <br><br><h3>  Social Media Alerts </h3><br>  AidropKing.io promotes airdrops in its <a href="https://twitter.com/airdropking_io">Twitter</a> and <a href="https://t.me/airdropking_io">Telegram</a> pages, <a href="https://reddit-marketing.pro/">Reddit</a> . <br><br><h3>  Brief conclusion </h3><br>  <b>Pros</b> : Simple to understand the main page of the platform and good design.  There are project evaluations. <br><br>  <b>Cons</b> : Lack of detail analysis of the project and there are no criteria for existing assessments.  Only basic information about the projects is indicated and no useful links are provided. <br><br><h2>  AirdropAlerts.com </h2><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/2j/od/ua/2joduasge-kcrnwe21q9hbwfmto.png"><br><br><h3>  Status </h3><br>  <a href="https://airdropalert.com/">Airdropalerts.com</a> is the oldest airdrop platform of all of the above.  They began their work in November 2017 and receive stable traffic, about 9.5 thousand visits per month. <br><br><h3>  Functionality </h3><br>  The main page of the platform is a simple list of airdrop projects, which are divided into 3 categories - Active, Completed and Upcoming.  The list contains only the names of airdrops without any additional information that might be useful to you, for example: project evaluation or the estimated cost of airdrops needed to complete the tasks. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/p2/9l/aq/p29laqrnjealy3zhsxzl1znngq0.png"><br><br>  The airdrops pages are very simple, include brief information about the airdrop, as well as links to the white paper and links to the social networking pages of the project.  It should be noted that there is also a tutorial on how to get free tokens, with links to airdrops forms and accounts for completing tasks. <br><br>  The template is visually unattractive, and the information about the project is rather scarce.  You need to manually complete each required task. <br><br><h3>  Airdrop rating </h3><br>  Airdropsalert.com allows users to rate airdrops, but the information is visible only after switching to each airdrop page separately.  Information on airdrops pages is sometimes linked to ICObench ratings, but not all airdrops are consistent. <br><br><h3>  Social Media Alerts </h3><br>  Airdropalerts.com promotes airdrops on its <a href="https://t.me/Officialairdropalert">Telegram</a> , <a href="https://twitter.com/airdropalertcom%3Flang%3Den">Twitter</a> , <a href="https://www.facebook.com/AirdropAlertcom/">Facebook</a> , <a href="https://reddit-marketing.pro/">Reddit</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCo7PW5Kp_MPekw2bNHcRtXg">Youtube</a> channels. <br><br><h3>  Brief conclusion </h3><br>  <b>Pros</b> : Airdrops are covered in several social media resources, including Youtube. <br>  <b>Cons</b> : No additional information on the main page of the platform.  Inconsistent and scant information about the project on the pages of a summary about airrops. <br><br><h2>  Aidropster.io </h2><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/cg/sq/gs/cgsqgsivapafkvwchfpulu7n7ae.png"><br><br><h3>  Status </h3><br>  The age of the domain <a href="https://airdropster.com/">Airdropster.io</a> is about 10 months <a href="https://reddit-marketing.pro/">,</a> and it coincides with the start of their activities, which began in January 2018.  Despite the active presence on the Internet and the beautiful design of the platform, Airdropster seems to be less popular among airrop fans with traffic of about 400 visitors per month. <br><br><h3>  Functionality </h3> <br>  As soon as you click on an airdrop, you will notice that the information about each airdrop is scarce, limited to a fairly brief description. <br><br>  The most important details about tokens are mentioned in a solid block of text instead of an easy-to-read table.  This greatly reduces the user interest in the site and the overall functionality of the airdrop platform. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/ls/2u/jn/ls2ujn7qv0mzjlt-38xcryi8snu.png"><br><br>  You get links to airrops forms and donations, but do not have direct access to the White Paper, the project website, etc.  Therefore, who needs additional information, will have to spend time searching for it, during the research of each airdrop. <br><br><h3>  Rating </h3><br>  Airdropster has a rating system for projects, but it is unclear how the team assesses these projects.  There are also discrepancies between their ratings and the ratings presented on popular websites dedicated to ICO in relation to the same airrops. <br><br><h3>  Social Media Alerts </h3><br>  Airdropster promotes its airrops mainly through <a href="https://twitter.com/airdropking_io">Twitter</a> , <a href="https://reddit-marketing.pro/">Reddit</a> and <a href="https://t.me/airdropking_io">Telegram</a> . <br><br><h3>  Brief conclusion </h3><br>  Pros: Airdropster provides a good list of current airrops, and a rather popular Twitter channel. <br><br>  Cons: Information about airrops is minimal.  The platform does not allow you to quickly perform tasks. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/bd/jg/d8/bdjgd8sagppc7v9jdzpm-ksk8va.png"><br><br>  Do you use other sources of information about active airdrops?  Share your experiences and links in the comments. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/429314/">https://habr.com/ru/post/429314/</a></p>
