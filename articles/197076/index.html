  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Frankenpad: history of the phenomenon</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Today, the subject of my article will not be the subject of a particular exhibit from my collection or just one interesting computer.  This time I will talk about a rather unusual phenomenon among fans of the brand ThinkPad, which would hardly have arisen among adherents of another brand.  There are probably several reasons for this - <ol><li>  friendly and inquisitive community of computer users </li><li>  relatively long production of lines based on the same design, but with different fillings </li><li>  convenient for small constructive modifications </li><li>  this reason is not the most rosy - sometimes the Killer Feature of the previous model was lost in new models </li></ol><br><br>  For a long time, users used the opportunity to keep their device convenient, updating (as a rule, not dramatically, but noticeably) its ‚Äústuffing‚Äù.  I would take about 1995-1996 for the beginning, but more on that below.  The name was later given - in 2004, the first time the word FrankenPad (from the name of the creator of the monster from parts of several people "Frankenstein" and the name of the laptop) was used in the user community forum ( <a href="http://forum.thinkpads.com/">forum.thinkpads.com</a> ) in relation to the non-standard upgrade of the 770 notebook But only in 2011 this epithet began to receive distribution.  Basically, this word related to the upgrade of the T60 to T61 series models, but it was often used in relation to the transfer of motherboards in the T4x / R5x series. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  To clarify, I want to note that for some models, the upgrade whales were supplied by IBM itself.  Let us agree to call frankenpad only the result of an unofficial one - an independent upgrade or a third-party upgrade. <br><br>  I invite you to delve into the history of the phenomenon and get acquainted with the possible options for building your own "monster".  <s>This will help me my faithful assistant Igor.</s>  <s>Ha ha ha!</s>  .  As dates, I will use the model year of release, which served as the basis for the creation of Frankenpad.

    <h5>  Year 1995. Model 701C / Cs "Butterfly" </h5><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/13e/13e/7e0/13e13e7e0996a6b82a5c094a55052e75.jpg" alt="image"><br>  The iconic and probably the most famous model of the ThinkPad brand appeared in 1995.  Belonged to the size of an ultra-portable notebook, the Butterfly provided a full-size screen (matrices larger than 10.4 inches were not installed in laptops at the time) and a keyboard, which was folded to preserve compactness.  At the same time, the laptop received a filling close to the maximum at that time - an i486-DX4 / 75 processor and up to 40 megabytes of RAM in the maximum configuration (top models had the same processor, but with a frequency of 100 MHz).  Due to the lack of built-in drives, the laptop had a weight of 1.7 kg - more than one and a half kilograms lighter than the equipped CD-ROM ThinkPad 755CD. <br><br>  But after six months, the first models based on Pentium appeared and everything began to turn ... <br>  The first laptop that can be called Frankenpad was created on its basis.  A third-party company, whose name has sunk into oblivion (maybe even it was not one company) after some time began to produce fees for updating these machines.  The board (most likely it was a modified and restored IBM production motherboard) installed an AMD 5x86-133 processor (P-rating 75, i.e., an appropriate Pentium 75 performance), supported up to 72 (64 + 8) megabytes of memory. <br><br>  To carry out such an update (as well as any other non-standard update), certain skills were required - the laptop needed to disassemble almost completely and replace the bottom of the two main boards in the package (on one lived a processor with system logic, and on the other VRM, an audio controller and other important trivia) . <br><br>  A relatively long break will follow - the models 755, 760, 380 and 560 were not interesting from this point of view.  In general, in principle, there were three large bursts of interest in the creation of Frankenpadov, the former being weaker than the others, and the latter the strongest.  So‚Ä¶ <br><br><h5>  Year 1998-2000.  770 / E / ED / X / Z Series </h5><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/d38/1e2/7b0/d381e27b08a4989a1d50dd1d33bab5fe.jpg" alt="image"><br>  Model 770, released under the curtain of 1997, was remarkable not only because it had impressive dimensions and was the last in the 7-series.  These powerful machines were the first DVD-ROM notebooks, among the options were analog video input, digital audio output AC-3, MPEG2 encoding / decoding acceleration card (all three options were actually the same - provided by the DEVA ‚Äî Digital and Enhanced Video Adapter) a unique screen 13.7 "with a resolution of 1280x1024. But at the same time, the most senior model received only PII-366, after which the ruler was closed. Similar machines appeared only six months later, the 770 series gradually dropped in price and began to fall into private hands. After all business user  will buy a new laptop, and will not make risky manipulations with the old iron. <br><br>  And this is where a wide variety of forms of frankenposing manifested.  I can not say that this was the first, but the list of options for monster building was considerable: <br>  1) installation of the video controller from 770E to 770, on the X / Z it was already on the AGP bus, the first two models used PCI <br>  2) Replacing Pentium II processors with Pentium III (770X / Z) - these laptops used the processor in the MMC-2 package, which allowed the CPU to be set to P3-850, and with some manipulations (processor soldering on the module, sometimes overclocking) - to 1GHz! <br>  3) memory manipulations - the laptop has three memory slots, one of which is available only when fully disassembled and from the factory contains 32 megabytes (770 / E) or 64 megabytes (770X / Z) of RAM.  Chipset 440BX, on the basis of which the laptop is created, can support up to 1 gigabyte of memory in 4 slots, which theoretically would allow to install 768 megabytes into this laptop.  But because of the bug in the BIOS, the maximum amount is 512 megabytes - 128 + 128 + 256 or 0 + 256 + 256. <br><br><h5>  Year 1998-2001.  600 / E / X Series </h5><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/f2a/520/cb7/f2a520cb7c2ede485c86e8bc85bf8daa.jpg" alt="image"><br>  One of the most popular laptops in history was released until 2001.  His popularity was very high, despite the considerable cost (I don‚Äôt have exact data, but 5-6 thousand dollars for a good configuration were the norm).  Given the many versions, long life and popularity, these machines simply could not undergo alterations.  Basically everything concerned the processor.  The memory upgrade was a standard procedure (up to 576 megabytes 64 + 256 + 256).  As in the case of the 770, you can install the processor in the MMC-2 format (not on all versions, they first installed MMC-1) up to 850 MHz, and if the module itself is modified, then up to 1000. <br><br>  These two models determined the second wave of creation of frankenpad and it was to the address 770 that this word was used for the first time. <br>  Then again there was a long break.  Let me remind you, speaking of the break, I‚Äôm talking about a break with respect to the model lines - there was no break during the time period - some users still upgrade the Butterflies, 770 and 600. The new rulers with the letter designation of classes did not provide such interesting opportunities.  Yes, it was possible to transfer the display between the two models or move the new stuffing into the old case.  There are more restrictions and less sense.  For some time‚Ä¶ <br><br>  At first, installation on ultra-portable X31 / X32 IPS screens became popular, but this was not widespread.  Although the concept is broad here is not very appropriate - the score goes to tens and hundreds, rarely thousands of millions of computers released.  Nowadays, there is an update of screens in A31p, T42p / T43p, T60p from IPS to IPS-LED. <br><br><h5>  2003-2006 year.  Model lines T40-T43, R50-R52. </h5><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/30e/69a/902/30e69a9028f0f84b28cc0ddef0ab872a.jpg" alt="image"><br>  I can‚Äôt talk about these machines in such detail, but this is not a very interesting topic - here, basically, it all comes down to repair.  The boards from the R series are cheaper, as well as the donors of the R-series, while with some modifications they fit into the T-series cases. In addition to T43, there were no models with integrated chipset graphics in the fortieth line of the T-series.  Sometimes the boards were re-installed to increase battery life and reliability (video chips fell off before the nVidia 8400/8600 series). <br><br>  Another version of the refinement specific to the T43 / R52 is the so-called ‚ÄúSATA Mod‚Äù ‚Äîthe hard disk has an IDE interface in these laptops and it is difficult to find a replacement, especially if you need more speed.  At the same time, the disk is actually connected to the SATA channel through the interface converter.  During reworking, the converter is disconnected, the connector for changing the disk is changed and an additional eyeliner is laid for the new connector. <br><br>
<h5>  2006-2008 year.  T60 / T60p and T61 / T61p models </h5><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/399/75b/2c6/39975b2c6900a6c2a3a63c14affb5583.jpg" alt="image"><br>  The latest one today, and probably the last model in general, which undergoes rather radical modifications is the T60 / T60p model.  And specifically the 15 "version under the screen with an aspect ratio of 4: 3. It was the latest ThinkPad model with such an aspect ratio among 15" inch models.  In these machines installed IPS screens with excellent color and wide viewing angles.  In the T61 series there were no such screens.  But there were more powerful processors (up to T7800, T9500 or X9000 instead of T7600), a much larger amount of RAM - up to 8 gigabytes versus 3 in T60 and more powerful video - both integrated and separately.  True, until August 2008 there were problems with the reliability of nVidia video chips, but this is another story.  After finalizing the T60 using the board from the T61, a machine is obtained that is capable of performing heavy tasks to this day.  There is even a small margin for the future. <br><br>  The screen is not necessarily taken from the T60p - more interesting options are possible.  The main thing is the case from T60 and the board from T61. <br>  The maximum configuration will look something like this: <br><table><tbody><tr><th>  Parameter </th><th>  Thinkpad T60p </th><th>  FrankenPad T601p </th></tr><tr><td>  Screen </td><td>  15 "1600x1200 IPS CCFL </td><td>  15 "2048x1536 IPS CCFL or 1600x1200 IPS LED </td></tr><tr><td>  CPU </td><td>  Core 2 Duo T7600 2.33 / 4M / 667 </td><td>  Core 2 Duo T9500 2.6 / 6M / 800 or Core 2 Extreme X9000 2.8 / 6M / 800 </td></tr><tr><td>  Memory </td><td>  3GB DDR2 </td><td>  8GB DDR2 </td></tr><tr><td>  Video </td><td>  Intel GMA950 or ATI Radeon X1400 or ATI FireGL V5250 </td><td>  Intel X3100 or nVidia Quadro NVS140 or nVidia Quadro FX570M </td></tr></tbody></table><br>  Not the last squeak of computer fashion, but very worthy! <br><br>  In addition to the options described, there are probably other, more exotic ones.  I heard about the options with laptops and X-series transformers, but there they probably also limited themselves to rearranging the boards or screens. <br><br><h5>  Instead of conclusion </h5><br>  With new laptops, this is no longer possible.  But maybe just do not need?  We now have IPS displays, SSD, faster processors, video cards, memory.  There is no only convenient for many screen with a 4: 3 aspect ratio, other user-friendly, but not so impressive-looking classical keyboards, ThinkLight, real buttons of muscle replacers are gradually disappearing ... <br>  An entire era can go away with the frankenpads, but I hope it will not go away.  At least her spirit, I will try to save myself and other fans of the brand. <br>  Thanks for attention!
