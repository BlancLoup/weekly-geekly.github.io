Habits in many ways determine what we are and what our life is like. <br><br>  If you ask, ‚Äúdo you see yourself being healthy or not?‚Äù, You will answer, ‚Äúyes, I see myself healthy and in good physical shape.‚Äù  If you ask, ‚Äúdo you see yourself spiritually developed,‚Äù you will most likely answer ‚Äúyes‚Äù again.  It is known that if a person does enough exercise every day, his body will be in good physical shape.  If a person has a habit of brushing his teeth in the morning and in the evening, then his teeth will most likely be healthy, which has a positive effect on breathing, and on less spending on the dentist, and on an attractive smile.

      For the past few years, I have been using Pluses for managing my habits. <a name="habracut"></a><br><br><h1>  What does it mean? </h1><br>  I have compiled a list of <i>positive</i> habits that I consider important to me and which I consider necessary to consolidate in my daily life.  Every day, I note the ‚Äúpluses‚Äù of those habits that I successfully followed today.  In principle, briefly, this is all: everything is very simple. <br><br><h1>  An example of my reference to ‚Äúpluses‚Äù </h1><br>  At first I noted the habits in the spreadsheet on Google.  The short name of the habits was in the columns, and each column was a day.  An example of a similar table: <br><br> <a href=""><img width="500" src="https://habrastorage.org/files/f1d/1a4/b1e/f1d1a4b1e0b34c14a834661ce51aa439.png"></a> <br><br>  Plus the maintenance of "plus signs" in the spreadsheet - you can automatically count their number every day (to assess progress);  You can also share a table with loved ones.  Minus - need access to a computer. <br><br>  After I realized that I needed to ‚Äúrest‚Äù from the computer, I switched to keeping a diary in a paper notebook (instead of using <a href="http://www.asana.com/">Asana</a> ), where ‚Äúplus signs‚Äù also began to lead. <br><br>  Now every day in a paper diary looks like this: <br><br> <a href=""><img width="500" src="https://habrastorage.org/files/eca/897/d3c/eca897d3c60b4251a904258633234815.jpg"></a> <br><br>  On the right - ‚Äúpluses‚Äù for this day.  For their exposure, I use a simple stencil: <br><br> <a href=""><img width="500" src="https://habrastorage.org/files/4ab/7e6/be5/4ab7e6be50e3430094562bd5f7cf4951.jpg"></a> <br><br>  From above, I put (or do not put :)) the three most important at the moment "plus sign".  These are the three habits that are most important for me and which I consider to be very important to fix (at the moment it is morning meditation, exercise, and healthy and moderate nutrition). <br><br>  Below, in statistics, under the column / + / I fix the number of ‚Äúpluses‚Äù for the current day (there were 24 of them on that day).  In terms of motivation, it helps to know that the day was well spent. <br><br>  In my case, habits include both very simple habits (such as brushing your teeth in the morning and evening, or recording expenses per day), and more intricate ones, such as reading spiritual literature, refraining from viewing erotic materials or the number of ejaculations per day. (the only column, which is marked not by "plus sign", but by number). <br><br><h1>  Conclusion </h1><br>  In my case, the ‚Äúplus signs‚Äù help a lot.  I managed to consolidate many important habits at the moment (including physical exercises, expenses management, posture tracking, or a small number of unread emails). <br><br>  Since I consider this tool important for me, I decided to share information about it with you.  I even created a site a year ago for doing "plus signs", but then I realized that I myself find it more convenient to keep "pluses" on paper, and not on some site.  So I decided to just share this information about this tool with other people. <br><br>  Of course, this is not a new tool.  One of the famous examples is the <a href="https://yandex.ru/search/%3Ftext%3D13%2520%25D0%25B4%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B1%25D1%2580%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B4%25D0%25B5%25D1%2582%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BB%25D0%25B5%25D0%25B9%2520%25D0%25B1%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B4%25D0%25B6%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BC%25D0%25B8%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B0%2520%25D1%2584%25D1%2580%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BD%25D0%25BA%25D0%25BB%25D0%25B8%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B0%26lr%3D213">conduct of the magazine "13 virtues" by Benjamin Franklin</a> . <br><br>  *** <br><br>  I thank the sponsor of my website created a year ago and no longer existing now for a donation of 100 rubles.  I am grateful to a good man who introduced me to this format of habits.  Also, thank you for keeping my habits motivated. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/297766/">https://habr.com/ru/post/297766/</a></p>
