In that post, we managed to remind you that Nokia was the first telecommunications equipment manufacturer to deploy a GSM network and create a whole line of GSM phones with support for sending and receiving SMS messages.  Today we would like to once again recall the events of the company and tell you about those things and technologies that first appeared thanks to us. <br><br>  This time we will go through the archives of Nokia and highlight some of the events from our past that have defined both the development path of Nokia itself and the course of development of mobile technologies in general.  So let's get started.

    <h4>  1981 </h4><br><ul><li>  In Scandinavia, the world's first international mobile cellular network opens, NMT, for which Nokia introduced the first car phones. </li></ul><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/bc0/5cc/e3f/bc05cce3fca73a0accece09479b7c7f5.png" align="right"><h4>  1984 </h4><br><ul><li>  Nokia launches Nokia Talkman‚Äôs first portable car phone for NMT networks. </li></ul><br><br><h4>  1987 </h4><br><ul><li>  The Mobira Cityman is Nokia's first wireless handheld phone, personifying the beginning of the turbulent history of mobile technology. </li></ul><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h4>  1991 </h4><br><ul><li>  The world's first phone call is made via the GSM network.  The network for the operator Radiolinja was deployed by Nokia.  Needless to say, the first call on this network was also made through the prototype of the first Nokia GSM car-phone? </li></ul><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/e95/8a7/d65/e958a7d654b4154c422682ece6cb13e5.png" align="right"><h4>  1992 </h4><br><ul><li>  The Nokia 1011 comes out, the first portable phone in the world that works in GSM networks. </li><li>  The Nokia 100 series, the first family of mobile phones for GSM networks, appears.  Yes, these phones really could be carried in hands. </li><li>  The first GSM 6050 GSM phone is released. </li></ul><br><br><h4>  1993 </h4><br><ul><li>  The Swedish network Europolitan, with technical support from Nokia, launches the world's first SMS center.

This tune has become one of the most popular and audible in history. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/f56/7fb/42a/f567fb42a6e0bb10589ff80b04097ae4.png"></li></ul><br><br><h4>  1995 </h4><br><ul><li>  Nokia is creating the world's first wireless payphone. </li></ul><br><br><h4>  1996 </h4><br><ul><li>  Nokia launches its Nokia 8100 product line, with its innovative and ergonomic design.  For the first time in the Nokia 8110 mobile phone, there appears support for the Chinese interface and Chinese in SMS.  Nokia becomes the first manufacturer to manufacture phones with simultaneous support for traditional and simplified hieroglyphs. </li><li>  There is a Nokia 2160 dual-band phone operating in AMPS and TDMA networks.

It is notable for the fact that for the first time profiles are used in its phones - quick settings of a number of phone functions calculated for different situations.  Hooray, now the phone can be put on a vibrating alert during a meeting! </li><li>  Nokia Cellular Card Phone, a PC-card with built-in GSM support specifically for activating voice communications and data exchange in laptops, is on sale. </li><li>  The Nokia 3810 is released, the first mobile phone specially made for Asian consumers, with a large full-graphic display and interface in one of the Asian languages. </li><li>  It turns out Nokia 6110 with a pre-installed game "Snake", proving that a mobile phone is able not only to fulfill its direct responsibilities, but also to entertain.

Removable phone panels are still the easiest and most inexpensive way to emphasize the personality of its owner. </li><li>  Nokia launches Nokia's special LPS-1 headset and Inductive Loopset for people who have to go with hearing aids.  During the conversation, the device filtered out background noise, thus providing clear speech.  Modern Nokia Wireless Loopset LP-5 headsets communicate with the phone via Bluetooth, vibrate on incoming calls and have a button for a quick answer. </li><li>  The Nokia 9110 communicator, the first mobile phone in the world with support for wireless photo transfer from cameras supporting Ir-TranP file transfer, comes out.  Also in this phone for the first time appears support for memory cards to expand the internal memory of the phone. </li></ul><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/3fe/975/73f/3fe97573fc8ad862e9bf6902b801707e.png" align="right"><h4>  1999 </h4><br><ul><li>  Nokia launches the Nokia 6185, the first phone to support three CDMA 800/1900 communication standards and AMPS. </li><li>  Nokia launches its first mobile phone with an internal antenna, the Nokia 5030. </li><li>  Nokia presents the world's first high-speed data terminal in cellular networks Nokia Card Phone 2.0.

In addition, the Nokia 7110 was the first phone with T9 predictive text input. </li></ul><br><br><h4>  2000 </h4><br><ul><li>  The Nokia 3310 comes out, the first mobile phone with a unique ‚ÄúDialog‚Äù function that allows users to communicate with each other via SMS messages.  In the dialogs, you can specify the user name and communicate as you did in the same ICQ. </li></ul><br><br><h4>  2001 </h4><br><ul><li>  Nokia makes the world's first voice call on the 3G WCDMA network based on the commercial 3GPP system. </li><li>  Nokia 8310 comes out, the first Nokia phone with GPRS support. </li><li>  The Nokia 8310 mobile phone comes out, which for the first time includes support for FM radio. </li><li>  Nokia launches its first standalone digital music device, the Nokia 5510. <img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/9ad/1a8/c89/9ad1a8c89e5ebb483960671cf38a804b.png"></li><li>  It turns out Nokia THR850, the world's first TETRA-terminal with WAP support. </li><li>  The Nokia 7650, the first Nokia phone with integrated VGA camera, appears.

About NFC, you can read <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/129007/">our separate post</a> . </li></ul><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/cd2/391/d59/cd2391d59e4491bb88fddc759e2c3a55.png" align="right"><h4>  2005 </h4><br><ul><li>  Nokia N91 becomes the first music smartphone in the world with 4 GB of internal memory and a standard 3.5 mm stereo headphone jack. </li></ul><br><br><h4>  2006 </h4><br><ul><li>  Nokia improves its own Nokia NFC shell for Nokia 3220 phones - now a phone with such a cover can replace travel tickets and even a wallet. </li></ul><br><br><h4>  2007 </h4><br><ul><li>  Nokia first introduces a reminder to unplug the charger.  These warnings first appeared in the Nokia 1200, Nokia 1208 and Nokia 1650. An interesting fact: the energy saved in this way could provide 85 thousand homes annually. </li><li>  Nokia launches the world's first smartphone with GPS and HDSPA / WLAN module, the Nokia N95.  Thus, this is the first phone that provides fast (thanks to a 3.5G connection) access to navigation. </li><li> In the summer of the same year, the second smartphone with GPS from Nokia, Nokia 6110, comes out, but with pre-installed maps - this is the first phone in the world with a full-featured navigator on the market. </li></ul><br><br><h4>  2008 </h4><br><ul><li>  Nokia N97, Nokia's first ‚Äúmobile computer‚Äù with a physical QWERTY keyboard and a touchscreen, comes out. <img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/634/9cc/1e0/6349cc1e050893e284f9d464719c1b5e.png"></li></ul><br><br><h4>  2010 </h4><br><ul><li>  Nokia has started providing free car and pedestrian navigation in their smartphones for free.  This still predetermines the choice of many users towards Nokia. </li></ul><br><br>  Of course, this is not all our victories, we just singled out the most noticeable and interesting to the ordinary user.  You can always find the entire Nokia history on the <a href="http://www.nokia.com/global/about-nokia">About</a> page of our website, and we will continue to publish something particularly interesting here. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/140851/">https://habr.com/ru/post/140851/</a></p>
