I would like to live happily ever after, be incredibly smart and strong.  And so that my relatives, friends and just good people had the same thing.  I would be engaged in discoveries, and finished them myself even after 100-200 years.  I would explore space. <br><br>  But firstly, any person is good up to a certain point, especially until he has an advantage over the rest.  And secondly, it will not be so easy.

      If we didn‚Äôt live in 2009, but in the year in which the DNA upgrade laboratories are opening tomorrow, I wouldn‚Äôt want to live there.  I would not like to witness a wilting race. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  <b>Option 1.</b> <br><br>  Yes Yes.  It is the withering of the human race, for what scientists will generate with upgrades will no longer be human.  It will definitely be a new race ... Perhaps some time after upgrades, humanity can come to a state in which the new race will be beautiful and self-sufficient. <br><br>  But the transitional period will definitely be disgusting. <br>  Most people are not idealists or socialists, and I do not think that they will change in 200-300-500 years. <br>  Such large-scale studies will be conducted by corporations, huge amounts of money will be invested in the development ... and, do you think that corporations will give every inhabitant a perfect upgrade? <br>  Also, such upgrades will not remain without attention of the military. <br><br>  Most likely, and as it is now - at first, the favorites will receive the magic pill, for big big money. <br>  The rulers will gain longevity.  The generals will find a powerful tactical tool in their head. <br>  Corporate owners will also upgrade. <br>  And so on ... the color of the financial and scientific nation of the planet will be transformed, acquiring, perhaps very useful properties ... for themselves. <br>  But most likely the upgrades will not be massive, why so - below. <br><br>  What will remain for people with small incomes? <br>  They will realize that the already large gap between the poor layer of the population is increasing by 100%.  Yes that trifle, at 10,000%. <br>  If in our "democratic" time almost every person, even from the slums, having tried, having put his elbows, having a light head, can make his way upstairs.  That in the world where there are long-livers, people with an improved brain - people from below will not pass.  Why are they? <br><br>  There are a thousand selected engineers, lawyers, doctors, or any specialists of that time.  Why risk picking up new ones from the poor?  There is a well-established loyal gene pool, you can get guaranteed quality offspring from them.  (Yes, I am talking about children in this version of the future as offspring, a product, and they can be compared to puppies. Who will lead an excellent bitch (dog) to be mated with a dog with an unknown line? Nobody. True.) At this rate society will come to a frank fascism.  The ruling race of the superhumans and the rest of the masses, perhaps even slaves. <br><br>  This is a cruel argument, but such an outcome for people is quite likely. <br><br>  <b>Option 2.</b> <br><br>  DNA improvements will develop smoothly and come to ordinary people.  Anyone paying for insurance or in general for it will be able to get an upgrade.  What happens?  Billions of supermen unconsciously hungry for blood and power.  Well, you can certainly not give upgrades to criminals and psychologically unstable individuals.  But this again looks like fascism.  Total war of annihilation is quite likely. <br><br>  <b>Option 3</b> <br>  <i>Happy End!</i> <br><br>  PS In general, the options are much larger, but the first 2 are most likely in my opinion. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/63727/">https://habr.com/ru/post/63727/</a></p>
