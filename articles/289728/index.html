Today we would like to tell how an IT project to work with the media on a personal example.  The other day the ToWave publication published material about us, which was the 13th publication in a row where the <a href="http://rocketcallback.com/">Rocket Callback</a> is mentioned.  We will talk about how to be free of charge in the media - we will not consider PR publications. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/aef/20d/f7d/aef20df7da7e4982b235d4b85d5fa6fe.jpg" alt="image"><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  Why do we need publications?  Any IT project, as well as the business as a whole, publications in the media can bring additional traffic, increase product awareness and site citation.  On the Internet, there are plenty of publications of various topics, and about IT today everyone who writes is not too lazy.

      <b>Regional editions.</b>  If your product is not from Moscow or St. Petersburg, then we advise you to contact the regional small media.  Yes, their audience is not very wide, and perhaps not targeted at all, but they should not be neglected - this is a great start on the way to publishing on TechCrunch.  Our project comes from Buryatia, so the first mention came from the Buryat media: <a href="http://www.infpol.ru/glavnye-novosti/item/8642-u-menya-vsjo-gotovo-k-pokoreniyu-mira.html">Infopol</a> , <a href="http://www.baikal-media.ru/news/business/287025/">Baikal-Media</a> , <a href="http://bgtrk.ru/news/detail.php%3FID%3D23542">Buryatia State TV and Radio Company</a> .  The latter even made a video about us and we got into the <a href="http://www.bgtrk.ru/video/detail.php%3FID%3D23508%26SECTION_ID%3D13">release of the program ‚ÄúVesti‚Äù</a> on the TV channel ‚ÄúRussia.  Buryatia. <br><br>  To get to the regional media is quite real - if the city is small, then word of mouth comes to the rescue, mutual friends.  You don't have to pay for it.  It is difficult to calculate the benefit, but personally it gave us several transitions to the site: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/d18/5dd/54e/d185dd54ed46442dadd2ca9e11fab96e.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Then we went to the federal edition, where the first was <a href="http://www.cossa.ru/profile/%3FID%3D61116">Cossa</a> .  Although it is difficult to consider this as the media, as there is a section ‚ÄúSandbox‚Äù, where you can publish everything without pre-moderation.  Nevertheless, Cossa also brought several vists: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/ef4/987/41d/ef498741d8854947b9745a91138c531f.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Then there was a bad experience with the portal <a href="http://lovim.net/">Lovim.net</a> .  With them, we almost agreed on the publication, wrote and even sent a guest post, but at the last moment we and the editors did not understand each other. <br><br>  But the experience with <a href="http://firrma.ru/data/news/4737/">Firrma</a> was successful.  We went there with an info guide on investments, the editorial board went to meet us and we lit up on the pages of the industry media with the target audience.  C Firrma article reprinted <a href="http://www.venture-news.ru/55595-rocket-callback-privlek-4-mln-rubley-ot-chastnogo-investora.html">Venture-news</a> .  This gave us 112 visits, of which 56 turned into registrations: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/ba6/a19/3f8/ba6a193f8465426db513df7e46670891.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  After that we lit up in mini-notes of small resources.  First there was the blog of the company <a href="http://introvert.bz/blog/%3Fp%3D1957">Introvert.bz</a> , and then <a href="http://hrdocs.ru/poleznaya-informacziya/gde-iskat-rabotu/">HRDocs</a> .  After that, we contacted the publication about startups ToWave, who first published <a href="http://www.towave.ru/pub/valeriya-makarova-rocket-callback-rossiya-vsegda-byla-liderom-v-sfere-servisov-obratnoi-svyazi-n">an interview</a> with our manager Valeria Makarova, and then a <a href="http://www.towave.ru/pub/rocket-callback-prevrashchaem-trafik-v-klientov-cherez-6-minut.html">review of our project</a> .  ToWave gave us not so many transitions: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/174/4db/3e7/1744db3e7b724bf086509c2c4bb25019.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Our friends from Apps4all have <a href="http://apps4all.ru/post/03-02-15-valeriya-makarova-rocket-callback-my-hotim-chtoby-rocket-stal-standartom-svyazi-2016-goda">published a</a> lot of stuff.  The last, so far the publication, was again <a href="http://firrma.ru/data/news/5069/">an article</a> on Firrma.  We are currently preparing info streams for publication on Oborot, Roem, CPU, C-news and The Village. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/a18/a62/041/a18a6204146541879f9a8d533a3c1eaa.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Returning to the title.  The media is happy to publish articles.  The only requirement is uniqueness.  So, for example, we were going to publish material about car services to the <a href="http://www.automarketolog.ru/">Automarketolog</a> portal, but it already managed to be indexed <a href="http://blog.rocketcallback.com/avtoservisy-moskva-callback/">in our blog</a> .  For each media, you need to come up with a separate information channel, and, accordingly, write a separate article.  It will be more effective if you first contact the editors and ask what they are interested in, suggest your own topics. <br><br>  Almost all the media immediately offer a paid publication (this is how we did not get on Lovim.net), but you still try to write a guest post first - a publication marked ‚ÄúAdvertising‚Äù will not be as effective as an expert article on a relevant topic.  In addition, to buy a publication in the media you always have time. <br><br>  Another tip is the media kit.  It is very useful when edition is very far from your product.  We have a press release in the media, 3 logos, 2 publications and 1 interview.  All this we have collected, beautifully packaged and uploaded to Google Drive.  Now we have translated all of this into English, since we are really going to go to the USA and plan to publish it on American editions. <br><br>  More transitions gave us <a href="http://spark.ru/startup/rocket-callback">Spark.ru</a> , which is not at all the media, but still makes it possible to publish.  766 visits brought us about 300 registrations: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/7a0/677/f93/7a0677f939ec40409bc91068e1bccc1a.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  On this, perhaps, everything.  Tips for IT projects that also plan to publish at various venues, and in particular, in the media: media kit, personal contact, suggestions for topics, unique articles, and various information channels.  There will be many failures, and it will be necessary to ‚Äúwrite to the basket,‚Äù but without this, probably, nowhere.  Finding the right media, contacting him and writing a guest post for them will not take much time, and there will definitely be pluses. <br><br>  Timurmalik Elmuradov, <br>  Rocket Callback. <br><br>  Successes!
