      human sleep consists of 4 phases: <br><br>  <strong>The first phase</strong> is the stage of falling asleep or, as it is otherwise called, drowsiness.  This is the transition from wakefulness to sleep, which usually lasts 10-15 minutes. <br>  <strong>The second phase</strong> is the phase of shallow slow sleep.  This phase is the longest, takes almost half of the entire duration of sleep. <br>  <strong>The third phase</strong> - the phase of the deepest slow sleep. <br>  These are the phases of <i>slow sleep</i> . <br>  And finally, the <strong>fourth phase</strong> - the phase of <i>REM sleep</i> .  Or the phase of rapid eye movement (BDG).  It is in this phase that we see the most vivid and memorable dreams. <br>  At the beginning of sleep, the duration of slow sleep prevails, and before awakening, the duration of quick sleep increases. <br>  All this is a long-proven scientific fact. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/85e/5e6/6e4/85e5e66e459145623fd53d86664f91d8.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  On average, a full cycle of 4 phases of sleep lasts for 1.5 hours, replacing each other, thus, a night's sleep consists of 4-7 cycles, and if we wake up ourselves, on weekends for example, then as a rule, at the end of all phases (which the bill depends on when you went to bed;)) <br>  So the point is not at all in ‚Äúthis or that leg‚Äù, but in the fact that the alarm clock interrupts the unfinished phase, which results in excessive irritability. <br><br><h2>  So what to do? </h2><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/4d6/3cd/b1f/4d63cdb1f2ba35e22c5e9fef83f736b0.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  <strong>Of course,</strong> you can calculate the time of falling asleep and waking up so that sleep is a multiple of 1.5 hours, but there are a large number of factors that complicate this.  For example, you probably can not know how long you fall asleep.  You may eat watermelon in the evening, which will cause frequent visits to the toilet.  Also, the state of a person, how tired he is, whether he consumed alcohol, how many hours before bed he ate - are important factors that affect the duration of the cycle, and in particular the phases.  And so on and so forth ... <br>  <strong>Believe me</strong> , this is not so easy as it seems and how they write about it, the author somehow tried to do it - almost without success. <br><br><h2>  What do we offer? </h2><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/0c6/06c/ed9/0c606ced99ace0847d0402017a552856.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  At times it is more convenient and more efficient (!) To use your <strong>iPhone</strong> as an assistant, who will determine the best time to wake up, based on your movements!  <strong>EasyWakeup</strong> is just for this!  All you need is to set the interval in which you want to wake up and <b>put with you on one surface</b> and it will wake you up at the most favorable time for your body.  It's more like you woke up yourself - a great feeling when you need to get up at 6 am;) <br><br>  Strictly speaking, there are already alarm clocks that track your movements in a dream to find a favorable wake-up time.  For example, aXbo (200 ‚Ç¨ ~ <strong>270 $</strong> ) or Sleeptracker ( <strong>$ 149</strong> ). <br>  EasyWakeup is the first smart alarm clock for the iPhone and its price is much lower than similar devices. <br>  For current information on products, prices, differences between them and where to download, see the <a href="http://easywakeup.net/ru/content/produkty-easywakeup">page with EasyWakeup products</a> on our website. <br>  I would like to note that EasyWakeup has an advantage over alarms, with a similar algorithm, since the program is constantly being improved and there are new functions from version to version, existing ones are being improved, and appearance is being improved. <br>  The program has already been translated into 12 languages ‚Äã‚Äã(Russian is present =)) <br>  <strong>EasyWakeup</strong> collects statistics of your sleep, it is possible to view the graphs of your nightly movements that you performed during the night, and if you wish, you can send the statistics by e-mail - for more detailed study. <br><br>  <i>Based on a review of one of our users Tiii.</i> <br><br>  This is our first post on Habr√©.  We will be grateful for the <a href="http://freeterra.org/wiki/%25D0%259E%25D0%25A1%25D0%2592%25D0%259A">quality feedback</a> . <br><br>  Respectfully, <br>  Pavel aka venture, <br>  team leader EasyWakeup. <br><br>  <b>upd:</b> transferred to the thematic blog. <br>  <b>upd2:</b> now you can simply use the program by putting the phone next to you on the mattress. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/51348/">https://habr.com/ru/post/51348/</a></p>
