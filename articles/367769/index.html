As they say, smart to learn from the mistakes of others, but a fool on his own.  So today's article - a few tips for both beginners and avid copterovodam.  All my advice will be taken from real life and, I hope, will help you to avoid unnecessary problems when flying on your Copters. <br><br>  Many of us are engaged in photo and video filming from the air and often have to travel outside the city.  And in order not to drag a lot of things, we take only the most necessary: ‚Äã‚Äãa quadrocopter, a few batteries, and of accompanying paraphernalia.  Thinking that everything will go well, we do not think about any additional things, but in vain! <br><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h2>  Tip # 1 - Propellers </h2><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/836/d91/c13/836d91c13073a28d93101af1946ebe22.jpg" alt="image"></div><br>  My first advice is known to all, but I repeat.  One day, in a hurry, I drove off to make a few building plans for later compositing with a 3d model of the future building.  I arrived, decayed and quite accidentally put 2 propellers on a quadric correctly, but mixed up two.  Well, it happens that here now ... Unfortunately, then they were not self-squeezing but on ‚ÄúGadget‚Äù ... therefore it is not difficult to confuse.  As a result, my kopter at the first take-off tumbled right in front of the customer.

      It is good that he was my friend and understood everything.  However, carbon propellers are not so weak "tyranulis" on the asphalt and subsequently reflected "zheleshkoy" in the picture from the camera due to imbalance.  I had to retake the next day.  Therefore, advice number 1 - take with you a spare set of propellers. <br><br><h2>  Tip number 2 - mounting the battery </h2><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/a89/051/464/a89051464f9ee2b16cafea48b94c22f0.jpg" alt="image"><br>  Another ‚Äúsituevina‚Äù happened when we went to Moscow to shoot Gorky Park.  The shooting was supposed to take place on a hexacopter with a mirrorless camera.  Under the strict supervision of the guards, who wanted just to wring our hands, I took my bag out of the car, put out a hex, and began to prepare it for flight.  At that time, she flew with two batteries on board, and they were fastened with ordinary <a href="https://dronk.ru/shorten/cl">velcro</a> ( <a href="https://habr.com/ru/company/dronk/blog/367769/">*</a> ). <br><br>  And so, I begin to tighten the second battery, and this sticky tape breaks exactly in half.  It seems like an absolutely insignificant reason, and the shooting immediately got up.  It‚Äôs good that I had a quadrocopter with me as a backup.  In a few minutes I took a similar velcro off him and, with the prayers ‚Äúat least I didn‚Äôt break,‚Äù I attached it to the hex by pulling the batt.  If there were no quadric, then the hex would not take off, because to attach the battery to the tape because of the design was unrealistic.  Therefore, here's a tip number 2 - take with you spare attachments for batteries.  They weigh a couple of grams, and they can help out if that. <br><br><h2>  Tip # 3 - Tool </h2><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/7d7/1fd/a6c/7d71fda6c65991dffc8336e93b5d486f.jpg" alt="image"><br>  There was such a situation with me.  We left far from home.  The road is as usual: either a pit or a ditch, and the bag under the hexocopter was then not too cushioning.  In short, we come to the place, connect the battery, and in response, nothing happens ... No answer, no greeting.  Neither the controller does not turn on, nor the music controls play.  As a result, I had to disassemble the upper part and get to the electronics.  He shook all the wires, but he did not find the reasons.  I collected everything back and connected the battery.  ‚ÄúDilin-Dilin-Dilin‚Äù - it all worked.  What the reason was never understood.  However, all plans were dropped and the work was done. <br><br>  PS I, of course, understood that I could have refused again somewhere, but we still ventured to shoot, because the flights were not high and not over people.  But if there were no tool, nothing could be disassembled either.  In general, take with you a <a href="https://dronk.ru/shorten/cm">set of tools for the copter</a> (I personally have one). <br><br><h2>  Tip number 4 - good old soldering iron </h2><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/9b5/71e/525/9b571e5252b34b11eeb222c75ff402fb.jpg" alt="image"><br>  For those who are currently shooting for <a href="https://dronk.ru/shorten/cq">$ 1,500</a> phantoms and <a href="https://dronk.ru/shorten/cq">$</a> <a href="https://dronk.ru/shorten/cp">3000</a> inspectors, this is unlikely to help, since there everything is already properly welded at the factory, and for any "normal" more beautiful it will be useless to solder.  However, for those who have self-assembly, it certainly can be useful.  Once again I went to Moscow with a quadrocopter.  Friends asked for something to shoot.  From the train to the subway, etc. We arrived at the place, we begin work. <br><br>  Hmm ... I do not understand anything ... everything turns on, there is power, and the suspension does not want to run in any way.  And then I realized that the power cord going to the suspension had fallen off.  And not the wire itself, but the connector, which is soldered to the board.  The fact is that I remove the suspension from the copter during transportation for "less overall carriage."  And for this you need to disconnect the power cord and wire suspension control.  The Chinese ration was not so hot, here is one "leg" of the connector and fell off.  Well, there are two options: either cry or repair.  I had such a <a href="https://dronk.ru/shorten/cn">soldering iron</a> ( <a href="https://habr.com/ru/company/dronk/blog/367769/">*</a> ) with me that works directly from a 12V battery.  The same battery was placed on my quad.  After 10 minutes, the suspension started working again and the shooting did not fail.  Such a soldering iron weighs quite a bit and takes up almost no space in the bag either, so be sure to take it with you on long journeys. <br><br><h2>  Tip number 5 - "Warmths" </h2><br>  Well, the last tip for today relates to winter flights.  Many departures have to do in winter.  Even at -15, -17 degrees, I often shot a snow-covered city and made great shots.  But such a shooting also entails some preparation.  Our drones are a set of various electronics that can endure the cold without our help.  However, with regard to batteries, then they need to take care.  I consider battery wrapping the best way for myself to wrap them in foam material, in which our favorite parcels come from China. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/71c/7e2/980/71c7e2980cb592993ff54d62da317948.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Depending on the thickness of the material, see for yourself how many times it is better to wrap it.  Having spent a little time on this operation, you not only increase the time of the flight in the cold, but also extend the durability of your batteries.  But this is not my advice.  Many people know that holding the remote in the cold with bare hands for more than 5 minutes is rather uncomfortable.  The hands not only begin to freeze, but the control of the control of the copter deteriorates.  I remember myself flying in the cold, and my fingers were so cold that I did not feel that I was flying forward or backward.  So, in order not to freeze hands, take with you such a <a href="https://dronk.ru/shorten/co">‚Äúwarm cover‚Äù</a> ( <a href="https://habr.com/ru/company/dronk/blog/367769/">*</a> ). <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/41e/fe1/42f/41efe142f384b68cc3db3c19f06fbcc5.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Very warm and comfortable.  And not only hands, but also the transmitter itself will be warm. <br><br>  Here are all the tips for today.  I hope they will help you to avoid unnecessary incidents in working with copters and get even more pleasure from this activity. <br><br>  That's all, with you there was a simple service for choosing sophisticated <a href="https://dronk.ru/">Dronk.Ru</a> equipment.
