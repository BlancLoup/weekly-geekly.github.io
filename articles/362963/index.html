Opinion of the University of Strathclyde Professor</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/93f/359/1a4/93f3591a493b3178fa6d4a1c24061e6a.jpg" height="419" width="671"><br><br>  Last week, Google corporation stirred up the news area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe Internet, telling about its intention to create a nanodetector of <a href="http://geektimes.ru/post/240802/">serious diseases</a> .  Then the company announced that the system will consist of two parts: a magnetic bracelet and magnetic nanoparticles, which will be introduced into the patient's body in the form of a tablet. <br><br>  The news was given a general concept of the concept itself.  Now Duncan Graham, a professor at the University of Strathclyde, a nanoparticle specialist and scientific adviser at Cancer Research UK, has decided to <a href="http://phys.org/news/2014-11-google-cancer-nanodetector.html">clarify the situation</a> on this project, as well as on the use of nanotechnology for diagnosing and treating cancer.

    <a name="habracut"></a><h3>  What can you say about the Google project? </h3><br><br>  In general, what Google has said about the project is quite common words, and it is rather difficult to understand exactly what the corporation is going to undertake. <br><br>  There are no specific proposals, references to any research, and there is no strategy for further research ‚Äî everything that is commonly used in scientific work.  But Google is Google, they do it their own way. <br><br>  Traditional science tries to evaluate all possible risks, to show how these risks are taken into account, to indicate ideas for project promotion based on a firm calculation, and then funding is requested.  Google is the opposite - they first say that they want to do this, and then take care of the details. <br><br>  A colleague and I noticed that Google has a powerful team of scientists with excellent achievements in their field.  Therefore, we can assume that they are clearly doing something very interesting, but this work differs from the traditional development of diagnostics. <br><br>  At the same time, the corporation does not disclose any details about the upcoming project.  In particular, they say that the ‚Äúnanodetector‚Äù will use magnetic particles.  However, most people think that such particles will consist of iron or cobalt - and this does not correlate with the real state of affairs, this is a simple assumption. <br><br><h3>  How are things going with nanotechnology and diagnostics? </h3><br><br>  Now "in the game" a large number of different research teams that are studying what has a common name "biosensing" - long-term monitoring of the processes occurring in the body, with the hope of early detection of problems. <br><br>  There are two main ways to use nanoparticles: optical - where nanoparticles either emit light themselves, or change the optical characteristics of tissues, and magnetic systems.  One of the most well-known specialists working along the second path is Sanjiv Gambhir from Stanford.  And it is this specialist, judging by <a href="http://www.wired.co.uk/news/archive/2014-11/06/google-cancer-detecting-pill">this article</a> , advised Google on nanotechnology. <br><br><h3>  What are the current problems with similar projects? </h3><br><br>  The first problem is the retention of nanoparticles in the body.  Foreign substances / particles are usually very rapidly excreted by the kidneys.  Therefore, the Google project should have in stock the way in which nanoparticles will be retained in the body. <br><br>  The second problem is bio-contamination.  We are talking about biological particles in the body, which simply stick around the nanoparticles, and make them useless. <br><br>  Of course, any biosensor must be accurate.  What is the accuracy of Google's nanodetector?  What is the level of false positives?  And we still do not mention this about various difficulties with legislation and ethical norms. <br><br>  You need to be very careful when using the word ‚Äúdiagnosis‚Äù, since only a doctor, not a tool, can make a diagnosis.  The tool can only show the doctor the symptoms, signs, after which the specialist makes a diagnosis. <br><br><h3>  Who owns the data? </h3><br><br>  There are also difficulties here, because Google is already experiencing considerable pressure from people and organizations who are wondering who can access the data stored on the company's servers and under what conditions get such access. <br><br><h3>  How else can nanotechnology be used in oncology? </h3><br><br>  Another idea is treatment with nanotechnology.  For example, there is a company called <a href="http://www.nanospectra.com/">Nanospectra</a> .  This company has developed a technology that uses gold particles.  These particles are sent to the tumor, and then heated by radiation, to destroy cancer cells.  Now this project is already being tested in humans in cases of head and neck cancers, as well as lung cancer. <br><br>  At the end of the interview, the professor reminds that not only Google works in the field of nanotechnology for the diagnosis and treatment of cancer.  Many research groups do this.  Nevertheless, with the financial capabilities of this company, the project can clearly give the world something new in this area. <br><br>  Would love to believe, right? </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/362963/">https://habr.com/ru/post/362963/</a></p>
