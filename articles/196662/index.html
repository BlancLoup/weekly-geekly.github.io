shows the company logo, on the side of the package there is a sticker with the model number and barcode of the device. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage3/081/ac8/4fb/081ac84fbfceeeef3270de6f95662239.jpg" title="Type of phone packaging" alt="Type of phone packaging"><br><br><img

phone is neatly packed, there is nothing superfluous in the box.  Obviously, this equipment reduces the cost of the phone. <br><br>  <b>The box contains standard equipment, which includes:</b> <br><br><ul><li>  Telephone set. </li><li>  Handset. </li><li>  Handset cord. </li><li>  RJ45 patch cord to connect to the network. </li><li>  Instruction and warranty card. </li></ul><br>  <b>The delivery package for the Escene ES410-PE model is missing the Escence AD300 power supply unit (12 volts), it must be ordered separately.</b> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage3/060/b68/ddd/060b68ddd7f14f3530de294584dbd35a.jpg" title="Phone kit" alt="Phone kit"><br><br><h4>  <b>Front panel and hardware buttons</b> </h4><br>  Conventionally, the buttons on the phone can be divided into 5 blocks. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage3/d38/5d6/ae9/d385d6ae96b79016bd96f5dacab2046b.png" title="Front panel of the phone" alt="Front panel of the phone"><br><br>  <b>The first block is the management of the service functions of the phone.</b> <br><br><ul><li>  "Menu" button to access the on-screen menu. </li><li>  The ‚ÄúService‚Äù button opens and closes the service menu. </li><li>  The "Directories" button allows you to access your phone's address book or one-touch call logs. </li><li>  There is a separate voice mail call button with an envelope image, if there are unread messages in the voice mail box, the button lights up in red.  A very useful button (the headset icon is shown above it) to switch to the headset and back, the button also has a light indicator, which allows the operator to control whether the headset is on or off.  Also on the panel is a separate microphone mute button, if the microphone is turned off, the button is lit in red.  The phone has a setting that allows you to automatically turn on the headset for any incoming call. </li></ul><br>  <b>The second block is the management of additional functions.</b> <br><br>  <b>Here are all the necessary buttons, just the ones that are used most often:</b> <br><br><ul><li>  Conference - creation of a 3-way conference (initiator, and two participants).  Creating a conference with a large number of participants requires the support of such a function on an IP PBX. </li><li>  Transfer - call transfer during a call. </li><li>  Hold (Pickup) - during a conversation when you press the button, the call will be put on hold </li><li>  Redial - to redial the last number. </li></ul><br>  There are also two buttons for adjusting the phone / ring volume. <br><br>  <b>The third block is the management of lines and multifunctional buttons on the screen.</b> <br><br>  The phone has four independent SIP accounts (four SIP lines).  By default, outgoing calls are established from line 1, if of course it is set up, if necessary to make a call from line 2, you need to press the line button, then dial the number ‚Äî the phone will send the call through the second line. <br><br>  The phone can accept four simultaneous calls.  The Line 1-4 buttons have light indication, when a call arrives, the diode of the line on which the call is being received flashes.  If the line is busy, the line button is lit in red; if it is flashing, an incoming call has arrived.  If the line is green, an active call is on the line; if it is flashing, the call is held on the line. <br><br>  Each of the multifunctional buttons displays the function currently active, for example: New call, end call, Do Not Disturb, Call Transfer and others. <br><br>  <b>The fourth block - 8 programmable buttons.</b> <br><br>  The buttons can work in BLF mode, speed dialing (number, prefix or SIP URI), or DTMF tone transmissions.  If we are talking about dialing a prefix, this function differs from dialing that the saved combination is automatically dialed, but the block of digits is not sent from the phone to the IP PBX - the phone is waiting for the dialing of the remaining digits of the number. <br>  The BLF (Busy Lamp Field) function allows you to monitor the current status of other subscriber lines in real time.  When the button is in BLF mode, if the button is red, the line is busy, if it is green, the line is free. <br><br>  The number of programmable buttons on the phone increase to expand to 200 by connecting the required number of expansion modules. <br><br>  <b>The fifth block is multifunctional navigation keys.</b> <br><br>  The block is used primarily for easy navigation through the menu, the ‚ÄúC‚Äù button is used to delete a character.  Using the Up and Down buttons, you can adjust the ring volume or the volume of the phone during a call. <br><br>  The panel has a separate large red button - ‚ÄúHands-free‚Äù, which allows you to turn on or off the speakerphone (speakerphone), it is full-duplex in the phone.  When the speakerphone is working, a red indicator lights up on the button. <br><br><h4>  <b>The back of the phone.</b>  <b>Wall mounting.</b> </h4><br>  On the back of the phone is a standard sticker with the model number, serial number and MAC address.  The model is equipped with a swivel stand, with which you can choose a convenient angle of the phone, you just need to press the buttons on the sides of the stand and set the desired angle. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage3/a62/4f4/f9e/a624f4f9e0825af08d51f221d2ff29c9.jpg" title="Back of phone" alt="Back of phone"><br><br>  For mounting on the wall, it is enough to bend the stand up to the stop, for installation in the stand there are two holes with which you can mount the phone on the wall. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage3/bbd/48c/547/bbd48c5472cdcf61d27c792815d90fc8.jpg" title="The back of the phone.  Wall holes" alt="The back of the phone.  Wall Holes"><br><br><h4>  <b>Phone Interfaces &amp; Connectors</b> </h4><br>  The first photo shows a block of interfaces.  For AC power using a power adapter, there is a 12-volt socket on the panel, two headset connectors and a tube with an RJ11 socket.  Two Ethernet interfaces - PC for connecting the phone to a computer and LAN for connecting to a local network and PoE power. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage3/46a/d6d/a42/46ad6da42ba668753c4c175d1b0289b5.jpg" title="Phone Interfaces &amp; Connectors" alt="Phone Interfaces &amp; Connectors"><br><br>  Two jack 3.5 mm are used to connect the headset.  This is extremely convenient, since many headsets have such a connector. <br><br>  <b>USB connector can be used in two ways:</b> <br><br><ul><li>  USB headset connection.  The manufacturer does not guarantee the operation of any USB headset, a list of supported headsets will be prepared in the future. </li><li>  To power the phone via USB cable, instead of PoE or power supply.  To do this, you need a USB cable type AMAM, that is, "dad-dad" </li><li>  His image is shown in the figure below.  When working with expansion modules it is recommended to use the power from the adapter. </li></ul><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage3/e89/e27/be8/e89e27be8d3f0c75357052b2255e1a2e.jpg" title="AMAM USB cable" alt="AMAM USB cable"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage3/5ec/f31/6a6/5ecf316a643ce5f7c578d278be6b9080.jpg" title="Interfaces and connectors: USB and Jack 3.5 mm" alt="Interfaces and connectors: USB and Jack 3.5 mm"><br><br>  Here is the panel with the connected wires.  The picture shows that all the wires are ergonomically connected and do not interfere. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage3/9a3/25d/829/9a325d829c361b147c5e7c3a93075c23.jpg" title="Rear panel with connected wires" alt="Rear panel with connected wires"><br><br><h4>  <b>View of the phone on the table</b> </h4><br>  This is how the phone looks assembled, high-quality plastic, the screen backlight is not very bright, but bright enough to read messages on the screen without difficulty. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage3/2c8/392/17d/2c839217df802f4b3d9650ec969ca86b.jpg" alt="View of the phone on the table"><br><br><h4>  <b>Escene ESM 32 Expansion Module</b> </h4><br>  Expansion module - a console with 32 programmable buttons connected to the phone.  Each button can be programmed to monitor the status of any SIP IP PBX line in BLF mode (busy / free / incoming call) or used for speed dialing, DTMF combination, dialing prefix or calling by SIP URI address.  The console is an indispensable tool for improving the performance of employees who work with a large number of calls.  The important advantages can also be attributed to the lack of need for an additional power source for the console - all 6 expansion modules receive power from the phone. <br>  As described above, up to 6 external expansion modules can be connected to the phone, we will take a closer look at the console. <br><br>  The device comes in a compact box. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage3/6cf/646/928/6cf646928eb3e175fdbcafda25d8e325.jpg" title="Expansion Module Packaging" alt="Expansion Module Packaging"><br><br>  The delivery package includes an expansion module, a metal bracket with four screws for securely fastening the phone with an expansion module, a patch cord with RJ-45 connectors for connecting the console and the phone, and a warranty card. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage3/b62/bc2/4b4/b62bc24b4a1e13fcda99b854cc38f281.jpg" title="Expansion Module Package" alt="Expansion Module Package"><br><br>  <b>On the rear panel are two connectors:</b> <br><br><ul><li>  IN is the input interface for connecting the phone and the extension console.  In the case of connecting the first expansion module, you must connect this connector to the EXT connector on the back of the IP phone using a patch cord. </li><li>  OUT - output interface for connecting the next expansion module. </li></ul><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage3/d37/c60/d55/d37c60d55b57340400643585ede5e844.jpg" title="Expansion module, rear view" alt="Expansion module, rear view"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage3/73a/250/902/73a2509021636f2e71cbec715a3e8133.jpg" title="Expansion module, rear view" alt="      "><br><br>  This is the look of the phone and the panel with the connecting bracket installed.  To fix it you need to tighten the four screws, it can be seen in the photo. <br><br>  After connecting the cable to the expansion module, to activate it, you need to restart the phone or open the menu ‚Äî the Menu button on the telephone panel, then button 2 - ‚ÄúFunctions‚Äù, then button 9 - ‚ÄúExpansion Module‚Äù, then press the button from ‚Äú1‚Äù to "6", which corresponds to the number of the expander that needs to be detected.  For example, pressing the "1" button initializes the first expansion module. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage3/a2d/458/5a2/a2d4585a2bb104d31818edc98cdd0284.jpg" title="Phone and console on the table, rear view" alt="    ,  "><br><br>  Expansion module and telephone on the table.  The back stand of the module is fixed in the same way as the phone and therefore they stand exactly and are equally adjustable in height, the wires do not interfere.  The design itself turned out to be reliable, there are no backlashes between the phone and the module. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage3/176/346/15a/17634615aabc1dc7602ea9f9fd5b7285.jpg" alt="Phone and extension module on the table"><br><br>  The panel is successfully combined with the design of the phone of the same size and shape, has compact dimensions and conveniently located buttons, the size and location of the buttons makes it easy to accurately "get" into the right one. <br><br><h4>  <b>Phone screen</b> </h4><br>  It should be noted separately high-quality screen with good resolution.  The phone has a large monochrome LCD screen with a backlight resolution of 240x160 pixels, which makes it easy to read information from the screen and display all the necessary information on the screen. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage3/1f6/280/782/1f62807826cb834385b9e23af7c42f13.jpg" title="Phone screen" alt=" "><br><br>  This is how the phone screen with the registered line in Russian looks.  ‚ÄúL1 # 10‚Äù and ‚ÄúL1 # 11‚Äù is an arbitrary label that is configured in the ‚ÄúSIP Accounts‚Äù menu and is called ‚ÄúLabel‚Äù. <br><br><h4>  <b>Dialing a number.</b> </h4><br>  When dialing a number, the button of the line through which the number is dialed lights up in red. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage3/f4a/e2e/5c7/f4ae2e5c765212c3ba0a8ba8afd7b873.jpg" title="Outgoing call" alt=" "><br><br>  Incoming call.

Unlike most phones from other manufacturers, which leave a minimum of settings in the phone menu and a larger number only through the web interface, the Escene developers decided to make accessible from the phone menu in addition to the standard settings, also settings related to SIP accounts. <br><br>  Such a move is fully justified, in some cases, you can configure the phone faster.  In addition, sometimes there may be problems with access to the phone through a web-interface or it may be necessary to explain to an employee remotely how to reconfigure his phone.  It will be easier for an unprepared person to use the phone menu, rather than a web interface. <br>  Initial setup using phone buttons <br><br>  So, we turned on the phone, connected the LAN port to the local network that has access to the IP PBX.  Employee's computer through the cable connected to the PC port. <br><br>  <b>Now we need to include the Russian language in the menu:</b> <br><br><ul><li>  Press the "Menu" button or the "OK" button, it is located in the middle of the navigation button block, a menu will open.  To navigate through the menu, use the Up or Down navigation buttons; to return to the previous item, use the Back button.  Next, press the number 1 (or the ‚ÄúOK‚Äù button), which corresponds to the choice of the ‚ÄúLanguage‚Äù menu, using the Up or Down navigation buttons select ‚ÄúRussian‚Äù and press the ‚ÄúOK‚Äù button.  Then press the "C" button until you exit the menu. </li><li>  Now you need to configure the network settings: </li><li>  Press "Menu", then select the "Settings" menu (or press the number 6), number 2 - "Advanced settings", the default password is empty, just click "OK".  If you need to configure a VLAN (menu item 2), go to the appropriate menu and configure its ID and priority.  Next, select ‚ÄúNetwork‚Äù, then ‚ÄúLAN port‚Äù, by default, after loading the phone, a DHCP client is activated that tries to get an IP address, therefore there must be a DHCP server on the network where the IP phone is located.  If all settings are correct, the phone will receive an IP address and will be ready for further configuration. </li><li>  If you need to use a static IP address, press the number 1 - ‚ÄúType‚Äù, select ‚ÄúStatic‚Äù and press ‚ÄúMenu‚Äù.  By default, the phone is configured with IP 192.168.0.200, to change the settings of the IP address, mask, gateway and DNS, use the menu buttons and navigation keys, after saving the settings, the phone will reboot.  I note that in this menu ‚ÄúLAN port‚Äù you can configure the port for access to the web interface, by default it is 80, as well as the port for accessing the phone via telnet. </li><li>  Special attention is given to the setting of the PC port (Menu -&gt; Settings -&gt; Advanced Settings -&gt; Network -&gt; PC Port).  Here you can configure the network operation mode between the PC and LAN ports.  In bridge mode, this is a two-port switch with support for a separate tagged or untagged VLAN for a LAN or PC port.  If you set the Router mode, an IP and a mask are assigned to the PC port, the NAT address translation is enabled between the LAN and the PC, you can also enable the DHCP server.  Thus, the phone becomes also a router with NAT support. </li><li>  Now you need to check the correctness of the network settings and see the IP address that was assigned by DHCP, press the ‚ÄúMenu‚Äù button, press the number 7 - ‚ÄúStatus‚Äù, then the number 1 - ‚ÄúNetwork‚Äù, in my case the IP address assigned by DHCP: 192.168.1.200 </li><li>  Setting up additional phone features </li></ul><br>  All these settings are made in the ‚ÄúMenu‚Äù -&gt; ‚ÄúFunctions‚Äù (number 2) <br><br><ul><li>  Auto Answer allows you to set up an automatic answer to a call without lifting the handset. </li><li>  DND allows you to reject all calls if the subscriber is busy. </li><li><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> VM number - set the number for access to voice mail (by default it is number * 97 - the standard number for accessing voice mail from the Asterisk distribution with FreePBX). </font></font></li><li><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> The hotline allows you to set automatic dialing of a given number immediately or with a set timeout. </font></font></li><li><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> Forwarding allows you to set conditional and unconditional forwarding to the specified numbers. </font></font></li><li><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> Button - program the buttons of the extension panel. </font></font></li></ul><br><h4> <b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Support for additional services (DVO) and programmable buttons</font></font></b> </h4><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The phone supports four independent SIP accounts, that is, registration on four different IP PBXs.

That is, the device supports only four lines, you can distribute them at your discretion: either assign two lines to two SIP accounts, or distribute one line to each SIP account and register all four SIP accounts at the same time. </font></font><br><br> <b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">As for the DVO, they all work correctly:</font></font></b> <br><br><ul><li>  Conference   ,       SIP 302 Moved Temporarily.

This is a very useful feature for several reasons. <br><br>  Firstly, if you have several phones that need to be delivered to a remote office, there is no need to buy a VPN hub at each remote location, you only need to configure the VPN client built into the phone.<font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Further, through the tunnel to register his phone on the IP PBX in the central office. </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Secondly, VPN improves security, more and more administrators are thinking about how to protect terminals that are on the Internet, two problems are becoming more acute: the danger of hacking the terminal and the difficulty of accessing telecoms operators to configure it, because often the terminal is behind NAT.</font></font> Using a VPN client solves both of these problems, so this useful feature will become increasingly popular. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage3/e53/0ee/e44/e530eee44740104fd4ccbb3395c55999.jpg" title="Menu &quot;Network&quot;

Next, click "Submit". <br>  Exactly the same must be done with the second line, for example, city number 78126470011 on the SIP server West Call.  Let's register it on a virtual PBX with a non-standard SIP port 9966: <br><br>  userid = 78126470011 <br>  authid = 6470011 <br>  password = eIoMzKsf <br>  sip proxy = uc.westcall.net <br>  port = 9966 <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage3/04d/c26/53f/04dc2653f634dbf3fcab3ab8fd70ce12.jpg" title="Setup for Westcoll" alt="  "><br><br>  To specify a non-standard SIP port (other than 5060), you must explicitly specify it in the SIP server line: uc.westcall.net:9966.  Next, click the "Apply" button. <br><br>  In case of successful registration, the corresponding display will appear on the phone screen, so information on the status of line registration is available on the Status menu page: <br><br>  Account 1: Registered <br>  Account 2: Registered <br><br>  In order to use the DVO buttons (transfer, hold, conference) no additional configuration is required. <br><br><h4>  <b>Setting up the BLF</b> </h4><br><br>  For BLF to work, you need to enable this feature on Asterisk in the Free-PBX configuration files: <br><br>  In the /etc/asterisk/sip_general_custom.conf file, you need to add lines that allow subscribers to monitor the status of the lines: <br><br>  notifyringing = yes <br>  notifyhold = yes <br>  For more information on setting up BLF for Escene phones, click here. <br><br>  Setting up BLF on the phone is very simple, you just need to specify the numbers for which you need to activate the BLF function, in our case, these are lines from 12 to 15: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage3/4c6/cee/d5a/4c6ceed5a92658b36d66c2603a234679.jpg" title="BLF setting" alt=" BLF"><br><br>  If everything is correct, then the first four buttons on the phone‚Äôs panel will become active - their status will be displayed, in my case in green, this means that the lines are free. <br>  As for the setting of the buttons for the Escene ESM 32 expansion module, it is no different from the settings described above.  In the menu "Expansion modules" -&gt; "Expansion module 1", you must program the buttons of the first panel, all changes are applied without rebooting. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage3/90a/070/f06/90a070f065a0a59547fe145ab6a87487.jpg" title="Configuring BLF for an Expansion Module" alt=" BLF   "><br><br>  After successfully setting up the buttons in BLF mode, the buttons of the lines that are currently free, will turn green, the buttons programmed in other modes (speed dial, DTMF, etc.) do not have a light indication.  In BLF mode, when you press the line button, the phone will automatically make a call to the line corresponding to this button. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage3/bb1/e2c/1b0/bb1e2c1b0ee5b6656128431e08c86b1f.jpg" title="Work BLF on the phone" alt=" BLF  "><br><br><h4>  <b>findings</b> </h4><br><h4>  The enhanced Escene ES410-PE corporate phone is very attractive considering its cost and functionality.  The device is easily configured, work stably, do not lose registration, has good sound quality, additional functions (transfer, hold, call forward, BLF, etc.) also work stably.  All this significantly increases the convenience and efficiency of working with the phone. </h4><br>  Support for 4 simultaneous calls, a large and clear screen, the presence of a built-in programmable eight-button panel and the ability to connect up to 6 additional modules of 32 buttons without an additional power source, as well as three ways to connect the headset at once makes the phone a very attractive option for handling large call numbers, for example, to the secretary.  Summarizing what has been written, we can conclude that the phone is an economical and efficient product in its class. <br><br>  <b>Key features of the phone include:</b> <br><br><ul><li>  Support four independent SIP accounts per phone. </li><li>  The presence of an additional Ethernet port for connecting to a computer and the ability to work in routing mode with NAT. </li><li>  The ability to connect the headset in one of three ways: via the RJ11 jack, 2x jack 3.5 mm or USB port. </li><li>  Most of the functions are displayed on the hardware buttons. </li><li>  Built-in programmable panel with 8 buttons. </li><li>  Expansion module support. </li><li>  Can be mounted on the wall and height-adjustable stand. </li><li>  PoE support. </li><li>  The possibility of power through the USB port. </li><li>  Clear backlit LCD screen. </li><li>  The ability to configure in addition to network settings, SIP accounts, speed dial buttons and redirects directly from the phone screen. </li></ul></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/196662/">https://habr.com/ru/post/196662/</a></p>
