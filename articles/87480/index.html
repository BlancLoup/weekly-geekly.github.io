  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Nonsense in the exam</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"><h4>  Introduction </h4><br>  To begin, tell the structure of the delivery of the EGE.  There are two mandatory exams - mathematics and Russian.  In 2009, a new decree came into force, according to which, in addition to these two mandatory subjects, the graduate chose at least two more examinations for admission to a specific specialty.  Now (after January 2010) they have returned the old surrender scheme, which requires at least one item of choice.  In this article I will talk about the minuses of the exam tasks in four subjects: mathematics, Russian, physics and computer science. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h4>  Nonsense / inaccuracies and other nonsense </h4><br><h5>  Algebra </h5><br>  From this year, part A was canceled, part B and C was increased and complicated. <br><br>  <u>Task B2.</u>  This task is a graph of the dependence of one parameter on another (for example, temperature on the date of the month).  It seems to be a very simple task, but ... there have already been several times when the explicit answer is not true.  That's because there is no clear rule for finding an answer.  For example, take the following problem (try to solve it yourself, and then compare it with the correct answer). <br><br>  <i>The figure shows a graph of the average daily temperature in the city of Omsk from January 14 to January 27, 1974. Numbers are deposited on the abscissa axis and the temperature in degrees Celsius on the ordinate axis.</i>

In an era of technological progress, such an account is meaningless.  Of course, there are all sorts of ways to simplify (folding, formulas, etc.), but again, adding / subtracting, etc., now is the lot of the computer. <br><br>  <u>Fuzzy wording of the question</u> .  Very often there are inaccuracies in the wording of the question, and this is quite important, because the questions ‚ÄúHow high should the fence be in order for the jet to fly over it?‚Äù And ‚ÄúWhat is the <b>maximum</b> height of the fence for the jet to fly over to it?‚Äù Have different solutions.  In the first, the answer will be from a certain number to infinity, in the second, this is a ‚Äúsome‚Äù number and will be the answer to the question. <br>  This is not the most wrong question, there are worse, though, I do not remember exactly their wording, but I think the meaning is clear. <br><br><h5>  Russian </h5><br>  The disadvantages include <u>several correct answers in part A</u> (I remind you that only one is possible in it !!! the correct answer), although most likely this is found only in the preparatory materials and there are no such shortcomings on the exam itself, I hope ... After all, the computer checks Part A and he already have the correct answers entered in the database, and if you chose the correct answer, but it does not converge with the answer in the database, it is 0 points. <br><br>  <u>Inaccuracies of the wording of the task in Part B.</u> For example, the task "Find among sentences 5-13 a single-sentence sentence that is part of a compound."  A person who has never undergone such a test will find 1 sentence that fits the description and will be part of the rights, but several answers can be the answer and you need to write both, and not one of them.  And just changed the endings in the question ... <br><br>  Otherwise, the Russian State Exam examines your knowledge of the rules, understanding of texts and knowledge of literary works (I have problems with the latter, because I read a little, then to give examples from classical literature for me is a difficult task, now I try to catch up by reading at least a summary of the works). <br><br><h5>  Physics </h5><br>  <u>Part B.</u> Only this minus is in the exam in physics, but it is very significant, because in this part only the answer is recorded, and not the solution itself.  What's bad about it?  - rounding ... I will explain.  You are given the values, for example, U = 3.8 (V), R = 1.793 (Ohm), you need to find the strength of the current (it is calculated by the formula I = U / R).  Considering it, we get the result I = 2,119353039598438, round up to I = 2.12 (A).  Again, it checks the computer with a fixed base of answers, let's say the answer was 2.1 in it ... Then for this task, which we solved correctly (!) And simply rounded "in our own way", they will give us 0 points.  Incredible stupidity! <br><br>  For the rest, I consider the physics exam to be one of the best in terms of design - clearly posed questions, all the necessary data (constants, decimal prefix translations) and the ability to use a calculator are present. <br><br><h5>  Computer science </h5><br>  This is perhaps the closest to the IT-sphere exam :).  Tasks include from the simplest (transferring Kbytes to Mbit, RGB-model, compiling IP addresses from pieces, etc., etc.) to quite complex ones (part C - writing programs on various topics (program adjustment, operations with arrays, strings, logic game (such as "who will win - the first player or the second?"), etc.). <br><br>  <u>Syntax.</u>  Usually, the program is written on a computer and autocompletion works, the EGE on computer science is written on sheets of paper and the program on them is, therefore any extra point, comma, forward slash, etc.  - minus point.  In fact, terrible <s>stupidity is</s> stupidity. <br><br>  I consider the question ‚ÄúVasya, Misha, Petya said this and that everyone told the truth 1 time and lied 1 time too, to find out who is right and who is to blame?‚Äù As an unnecessary task.  For me, it is so nedo- <a href="http://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%2597%25D0%25B0%25D0%25B3%25D0%25B0%25D0%25B4%25D0%25BA%25D0%25B0_%25D0%25AD%25D0%25B9%25D0%25BD%25D1%2588%25D1%2582%25D0%25B5%25D0%25B9%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B0">"The Mystery of Einstein</a> . <a href="http://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%2597%25D0%25B0%25D0%25B3%25D0%25B0%25D0%25B4%25D0%25BA%25D0%25B0_%25D0%25AD%25D0%25B9%25D0%25BD%25D1%2588%25D1%2582%25D0%25B5%25D0%25B9%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B0">"</a> <br><br>  <u>Inspection commission</u>  Part C in computer science, but like in any other subject, is checked by the teacher.  In EGE tasks, programs are usually presented in 3 programming languages: C, Pascal, BASIC.  I study C and wanted to write programs on it, but when I asked our teacher if people from the commission could check my solution of the problem in such a language, she replied: ‚ÄúThey can, but if they don‚Äôt understand something (because that most schools learn Pascal, not C), they will withdraw points. ‚Äù <br>  In order not to lose points due to ‚Äúrare commission meetings with C‚Äù, you have to write a solution to the tasks on Pascal. <br><br><h4>  Conclusion </h4><br>  In conclusion, I want to say that for me the USE is not a true test of human knowledge.  I do not want to say that it is better to return to the <s>buy-out</s> final exams of the old type, but the Unified State Examination is also not the best option ... There are too many mistakes and any shortcomings in it.  So I want to pass exams faster and forget this nonsense, because useful from this, for me again - 0.1%. <br><br>  <b>PS</b> Everything written here is based on my preparation for the exam, this is just my opinion.  For some, all this is seen differently.  I just tried to highlight the obvious disadvantages of the current USE scheme. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/87480/">https://habr.com/ru/post/87480/</a></p>
