CeBIT brings us ... <br>  Continuing the <a href="https://habr.com/blogs/hosting/52591/">theme of</a> non-standard and low-cost VPS offers, I would like to tell you about the new offer of the large German hosting company Strato.  Especially for Sebit, MultiServer X was prepared to announce the product (currently in beta testing). The product is a dedicated server with a pre-installed virtualization platform that allows you to create up to 25 virtual machines and, at its discretion, assign them CPU / RAM / HDD resources within Opportunities host pieces of iron.  At the same time, 4 or 8 VPS can be launched, depending on the plan - thus the product is aimed at customers who, due to their service, require several isolated VPS, including  with serious resources. <br><br>  We look: <br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/kqdZ3cNqLYc&amp;xid=17259,15700022,15700186,15700190,15700253,15700256,15700259&amp;usg=ALkJrhiZV81tI_sGWLTLClTqCd-taQOhwA" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br><a name="habracut"></a>

      In practice, several different configurations were allowed for open beta testing, at the moment the framework is as follows: <br>  Strong budget: Opteron 1210 (2x1.8 GHz), 2x250 Gb HDD, 1GB of RAM for 20 euros per month !!! <br>  Production: Opteron 2346 (4x1.8 GHz), 2x750 Gb HDD, 8 GB RAM for 100 Euro <br>  Beast: Opteron 2382 (4x2.6 GHz), 2x1.000 Gb HDD, 16 GB RAM for 150 Euro <br>  There were even cheaper and even free models but they were disassembled very quickly.  I suppose that prices after the beta test increase significantly in any case, it hurts sweetly <br><br>  In general, the proposal causes mixed feelings - on the one hand, it is interesting, on the other hand, as old as the world.  Strato used to be famous for the well-developed backend of its data centers, and therefore MultiServer could well surprise with quality, because the introductory information on the site does not give the slightest idea about the internal structure of the product.  In practice, the result turned out to be sobering - virtualization is done by XEN 3.2.x, the control panel is very primitive, terribly slow and allows you to install only Debian or Suse, only RAM / CPU / HDD shares are available from VPS installations, no further configuration is expected.  Screenshots of the panel can be viewed in the review from <a href="http://www.blogduell.de/2009/03/05/der-strato-multiserver-im-test-i/">BlogDuell</a> <br><br>  This most unprecedented news plunged me into dismay, of the whole range of services available to dedicated servers, only the network load remained to reinstall or repair the final system.  In fact, the panel has become a primitive Xen frontend and no more.  Some special optimization of iron or something else the polls did not reveal.  By and large, the result that is absolutely identical with the product can be achieved by installing vAdmin or any other panel for managing Xen subsystems on a rented root server.  Since no serious SLA is offered (yet), the product rolls over into the VPS user entry segment with increased resource requirements and reduced administration burden.  The lack of direct access to the host system also creates serious restrictions on setting up routing and therefore, the product is not interesting to VPS sellers and is suitable only for the end-user of a beginner level who is not able or unwilling to raise their own VPS breeding ground. <br><br>  If you compare it with offers for the same end customers, it turns out quite interesting in the budget segment - the market price of 1gb VPS will start from 30-40 dollars a month, and the resources on it will still be equal to the high-quality representative of the market, SliceHost, for 1GB RAM relies 1/16 of the CPU time of the four-core Xeon 8GHz +, which is not so much for CPU-intensive applications even taking into account the burst.  At the same time, due to the lack of know-how ‚Äúlicensed‚Äù by the client, prices are close to the root servers, agree that even the budget configuration described in the beginning of the note cannot be rented for $ 25 a month in Russia.  That‚Äôs why the economical offer may become interesting. <br><br>  Strato as a whole turned out to be an entertaining VPS box for lazy and unpretentious at a very low price, I think that Strato‚Äôs PR ambitions are really reasonable, it‚Äôs a sin not to use this situation :) </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/54395/">https://habr.com/ru/post/54395/</a></p>
