  <section class="page js-page"><h1>How to transfer affairs at dismissal</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  I am the head of 1C development department.  In my submission there are 4 developers and 3 support specialists.  The stars were such that I decided to leave the company.  Signed a statement, agreed on two weeks of working off.  HR strained, rushed to look for a replacement, but most likely in 2 weeks they will not be able to find anyone and I have a question about what needs to be done to leave ‚Äúbeautifully‚Äù, so that the person who replaces me can enter the course as painlessly as possible affairs  Reflections poured here in such a list. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  1. Create a knowledge base.  Even if the company does not have an application in which you can bring together all the knowledge that is stored in the heads of your developers, and most importantly - in your - install such an application.  I chose Confluence, bought it for my money (a license for 10 users costs only 600 rubles).  What data should be placed in the knowledge base: <br><br>  ‚Ä¢ List of databases.  Yes, it is obvious that all programmers in the company know all the bases and this task seems useless, why describe what everyone already knows, but your successor will probably thank you at least once for ‚Äúyour‚Äù workplace on the first day and without conducting extra questions, get a general picture of what is what in the company.  Programmers do not like change, change of leader for them is stress, a new boss who started his career in the company with endless questions ‚Äúand what is this base?  And who is the owner?  And what is her business sense? ‚ÄùWill cause, if not rejection, then, at least, a hidden displeasure. <br><br>  ‚Ä¢ List of applications.  If the company uses more than one application and there is no unambiguous connection between it and the database, then there must be a list - which application is responsible for what, who works in it, who owns the application, what is the criticality of the application (idle time is possible). 1 minute, within 1 hour, within 1 day, etc.)

      ‚Ä¢ List of licenses.  For some reason, in small companies, the attitude towards licenses is very careless, the main thing is to buy, and what will happen next, the development department is not at all interested.  I consider this a vicious practice, as a rule, data on licenses (from whom they were bought, when, how much they cost, what legal entity they were registered for) are required at the most inappropriate moment, for example, when you subscribe to ITS (1C nicknames will understand me) or do not let God with the appearance of people in masks.  Programmers like to throw off this task on the system administration department, because sysadmins often engage in procurement, and in turn, having completed the task (having purchased and installed the software) consider their mission to be completed.  Why complicate your successor, and so difficult task? <br><br>  ‚Ä¢ Exchange schemes between different applications.  In small companies, the exchange is often written "on the knee," as they say "..., ..., and in production."  It does not reach the description of formats, boundary conditions, even the frequency of exchange.  However, the great stress for a new manager to get a call from the financial director at 9 am ‚ÄúWe don‚Äôt work here, but always worked, figure it out.‚Äù  Exchanges are a big problem in a company with a dozen heterogeneous, sometimes self-written systems.  The described exchange schemes will help the new person at least begin to analyze the cause of the failure. <br><br>  ‚Ä¢ Basic business processes.  This is trite.  It is obvious.  However, I do not remember that in the knowledge base the most basic business processes carried out 10 times a day were stored.  Describes the processes performed once every six months, describes the processes that are never performed.  But the very processes that everyone knows about, the receipt of goods, the calculation of the cost, the setting of prices - they are not.  Why describe what everyone knows and so?  Believe the word, your successor certainly will not say ‚Äúwhy did he do it?  The same is clear to everyone! ‚Äù <br><br>  2. Start a task tracking system.  Yes, yes, there are companies in which it is not.  Yes, there are many such companies.  Tasks arrive in various ways, by mail, by a call from the immediate supervisor, from other users, the programmers themselves invent tasks.  You can keep them in your head, in Excel, in Outlook.  I think this is wrong, but my opinion may not coincide with yours.  But if you have decided to leave the company - give the list of tasks in order.  It is a chore, but it is necessary.  I use Jira, but there are a large number and free solutions.  It is not necessary to describe the task in detail, for a new person in any case this will not be enough, the following points will suffice: <br><br>  ‚Ä¢ Short name of the task. <br>  ‚Ä¢ Customer <br>  ‚Ä¢ Contractor (if someone is already engaged in the task) <br>  ‚Ä¢ A priority <br>  ‚Ä¢ Required time to solve the problem <br><br>  3. Increase the salary of programmers.  If your company does not have a planned salary increase, for example, once a year - make every effort to raise the salary of developers to the current market level. <br><br>  4. Make a list of contacts.  As a rule, when you need a contractor with whom you spoke six months ago, you simply do a search in the mail and get the phone number you need from his signature.  Do not forget - your successor most likely will not have access to your mail, and even if there will be - to find something, I don‚Äôt know what is there, I don‚Äôt know where - sometimes an impossible task. <br><br>  I would be happy if in the comments they help me expand this list.  What exactly did you miss when you came to a new job? </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/285632/">https://habr.com/ru/post/285632/</a></p>
