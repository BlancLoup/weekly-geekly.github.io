    <blockquote>  <strong>Freelance</strong> - a form of labor organization, with which the employer and the executor can be located as distantly from each other. </blockquote><br><br>  <strong>Wikipedia</strong> rightly <a href="http://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%25A4%25D1%2580%25D0%25B8%25D0%25BB%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BD%25D1%2581">describes the</a> understanding of freelancing, for one thing that has changed since the beginning of time - this is the possibility of remote work.  Thanks to the online and unattractive layout of a design or code, the dispatcher can be in any point of the planet. <br><br>  A freelance event can be called massive without any doubts, and I want to discuss with you such a question as the reasons why people become freelancers.  So: <br><br><h2>  1. Everybody was beating, and I was beating </h2><br>  Although we have found out, what is the movement of what is new is new, but what is new and old, but the essence of freelance, because of remoteness, <strong>is new</strong> .  Therefore, freelancing and can be called the terrible word "fashion". <br><br>  Precisely because of the weight and ‚Äúmodality‚Äù, many young people can take a job in the studio and go ‚Äúon the bed‚Äù.  It is possible, and in the studio was good and cozy, but many people go to freelancing, but nothing in vain.  Here and it is <strong>necessary to me</strong> .  So, the first reason - the continuity of the trend. <br><br><h2>  2. Himself a regissor </h2><br>  Very significant reason why people can go to freelance, I think it is my desire to manage my own time. <br><br>  The head of the layout of productions makes 10 animated banners for the day.  After this, you need to draw 15 avatars and listen to the lecture about it, so you need to listen to the boss, who in the same way wanted 15 banners and avatars of another size, which is a so affectionate, so <strong>affectionately affectionate</strong> . <br><br>  Such ‚Äúsamoudura‚Äù, which do not want to listen to the designer, and forced to listen only to themselves, and are a <strong>good incentive</strong> to change the place or type of work. <br><br>  The most interesting thing in this situation is that, after the employee‚Äôs dedication, the head of the helm will always look for another who will listen to him.  And do not think about that, which we could have and even ask the foreign opinion about setting the task or writing the TOR. <br><br><h2>  3. My house - my strength </h2><br>  The person for which the heading of this paragraph is one of the <strong>foundations of life</strong> is considered to be the best place for rest.  And what less time is left for the domination (the trainings and the breakthroughs of the trainings and the obligatory corporations, etc.), in this way, he ponders over this, in particular, the <strong>subject's</strong> sweeping troubles, and the troublemaker. <br><br>  People who have changed because of this office for freelance see a lot of advantages from home work.  And these advantages often lead to no shortcomings of such work. <br><br><h2>  4. Own projects </h2><br>  Do you want to make your online project, but when will you do it?  In the morning - in the meter and at work, in the afternoon - a lot of tasks, in the evening - a tube, a meter, a break from work (but a couple of hours can be worked, it is not enough for you, because of your business, you can work.  In the output, they want and <strong>rest</strong> . <br><br>  As quoted by someone who is Nikolai Pomanko, there are two ways out. <br><br>  <strong>The first</strong> is to refuse this undertaking, and <strong>secondly</strong> - to donate money and leave for freelancing.  In this way, we will be able to ensure the current expenses with the help of orders, and the rest of our time to keep our project. <br><br><h2>  5. The Tambov wolf to you tvaris </h2><br>  Or simply - <strong>dislike for team work</strong> .  I will not assess whether it is good or good, but the fact remains - for some people it is more pleasant and more comfortable to work one-on-one. <br><br>  This lack of desire: <br><ul><li>  run all over the kolkhoz on the trek </li><li>  go to the meeting </li><li>  discuss in the kitchen the follow-up of the match </li><li>  eat freestanding buterbrods on the corporation </li><li>  many others, each will be able to complement the list for a dozen other reasons. </li></ul><br>  Such <strong>love for individuality is</strong> often characterized by powerful personalities, who are usually charismatic, but not always protected.  Alternately, they gain something else - a collectivist forces him to go along, and while someone else does not want (or can not), they have to do it, they have to look for another solution. <br><br>  ‚ÄúI live with volleys like a volcano howl‚Äù - quite a while I wondered how precisely this messenger reflected the current situation, trendiness, and any kind of imitation. <br><br>  These are the 5 factors that I am grateful to consider to be the <strong>main reasons</strong> for which people leave in freelance.  Ready to listen to your opinion on this issue.  <strong>What are I wrong in and where is not far from the truth?</strong> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/41576/">https://habr.com/ru/post/41576/</a></p>
