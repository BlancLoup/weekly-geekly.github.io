  <section class="page js-page"><h1>New utorrent bugs or what Bittorrent programmers are preparing for us</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Many utorrent users are switching to new versions of the program out of habit or until such time as they have something to stop working.  Someone settled on 2.2.1 or 2.0.4 as the latter more or less stable, while others are still true 1.8.2 and even 1.7.7.  What is so frightening and attracts the third version of utorrent?  Let's try to trace and understand the changes that were and those that await us in the future. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/341/6cc/e9a/3416cce9a36a18bb0909ce70c4a05d8c.jpg" alt="image"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h5>  Evolution utorrent </h5><br>  My first utorrent installed was 1.8.2.  Just the time when these clients began to fasten magnet links.  Perhaps the errors that utorrent programmers made when adding this feature turned out to be too noticeable for users of 1.7.7 and 1.8.2.  It can be said that from this point on, controversial approaches to creating a program began to be used. <br>  Then the developers tried to bring to mind the alpha version 1.9, which had a lot of innovations.  From notable such as: support for udp trackers, new utp protocol, applications, the work of additional parameters in the magnet link.  But version 2.0 went into a stable release, and for a long time they tried to patch up to version 2.2.1. <br>  And here begins the most interesting.  From version 3.0, radical changes come to the program, we were prepared for them with special alpha versions of utorrent under the names ‚ÄúFalcon‚Äù and ‚ÄúGriffin‚Äù.  But most of us noticed only a huge number of glitches and problems in the hard disk.  Therefore, for a long time, many rightly refused to switch from 2.2.1 to 3.x.  A new in the 3.x was a lot: <br><br>  A technology called DNA was quite interesting.  Under this name they tried to shove two ideas at once: <br>  1. Uploading files via p2p with the help of special files that were launched on a computer without a torrent client, or they could be launched in utorrent itself, while the blue DNA icon appeared in the utorrent main window (unfortunately the screenshot was not saved).  Such special files offered to download their customers such as the ASUS website in the driver downloads section.  Having run them, the user could then download the driver files themselves via p2p. <br>  2. View the video in the player embedded on the http page with partial download from p2p.

      <br>
      Magnet links understood new additional parameters ws (web-sid) and fl (download torrent file via direct http link) <br><br>  The client has a built-in mechanism for streaming media files when it was possible to download and simultaneously watch a movie. <br><br>  Many providers have waited for the isp.bep22 option to be enabled by default. <br><br>  In addition to the work of the ip-filter in the client, users had the opportunity to create a special file of priority IP ranges, to which utorrent is connected to a pending queue.  Thus, many managed to significantly increase the download speed. <br><br>  View "ratings" and "comments." <br><br>  And finally, by many forgotten, but still working today, the ability to transfer files to friends or acquaintances from a torrent client through a special proxy server using the http protocol.  Which by the way, can be used as a proxy web-sid. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/e94/684/999/e94684999b1f4fdb664b243c7ea8202c.jpg" alt="image"><br>  All you have to do is drag and drop any file or folder into the program window and utorrent will create a special link to the http page from which your friend who is not aware of the existence of torrents and p2p can download files from your computer even if you are both a NAT provider.  Unfortunately, apparently, the developers will soon remove this setting from the program, because in new versions of utorrent it only works with dancing with a tambourine.  But who still wants to return its performance to your utorrent 3.x, change the following parameters in the <b>hidden</b> settings of the program. <br>  By pressing and releasing SHIFT and F2, go to Settings ---- Advanced.  At the bottom of the list, find and change the values ‚Äã‚Äãin the rows: <br>  webui.raptor_host - raptor.utorrent.com <br>  webui.raptor_port - 80 <br>  webui.raptor_secure - false <br>  webui.talon_host - remote.utorrent.com <br>  webui.talon_port - 80 <br>  webui.talon_secure - false <br>  In the Remote Access setting, you must create and enter a name and password, it will not work without them! <br><br>  Subsequent versions up to 3.3.2 inclusively can be called bug fixes.  And all in the end it would be good with the stability of the program in the future ... if not for the new ideas and with it the new utorrent 3.4 <br><br><h5>  Utorrent 3.4 - a forgotten revolution? </h5><br>  Do you think after the failures with DNA and raptor.utorrent.com developers threw plans to integrate the torrent and the web into a long box?  No matter how wrong!  It all starts in a new way.  This time utorrent should turn into a http file server, but of course with its p2p features. <br><br>  <i>A small digression before continuing.</i> <i><br></i>  <i>You should understand that Bittorrent is a commercial organization that has not been interested in decentralization of p2p for a long time.</i>  <i>Many features in the program disappear and appear, and most of us don‚Äôt even know about their existence.</i>  <i>All aspirations in the development of utorrent aimed at making money.</i>  <i>For this reason, do not expect anything good in new program builds.</i>  <i>With great probability, everything about what will be written below, in utorrent 3.5 will be removed or radically redone, that is, you cannot use it anymore.</i> <i><br></i> <br><br>  Of the small noticeable changes in utorrent 3.4.2, I‚Äôll probably work with https web sites (Dropbox still distributes some of my torrents on the root tracker) and non-switchable ads for the Pro version. <br><br>  The most interesting thing is hidden from our eyes, but if you pull on the string, you can find and ‚Äútouch‚Äù what is being done for us now and maybe will work in the next versions of the program. <br>  The first tip is hidden in the <b>Playback</b> setting. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/071/0f9/1b8/0710f91b81f0f8219a4f055c169db887.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Further there was an option to copy the file link <br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Copy Stream URL</b> <div class="spoiler_text"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/e70/7b3/56c/e707b356c08bbd0aacdd9f4569de616a.jpg" alt="image"><br></div></div><br>  The copied link turned out this type <br><pre><code class="html hljs xml">http://pairing:1B40250178C560733172CE3C811A4ACA831D6FB8@127.0.0.1:15906/proxy?sid=2&amp;file=0&amp;token=1B40250178C560733172CE3C811A4ACA831D6FB8&amp;pairing=1B40250178C560733172CE3C811A4ACA831D6FB8&amp;service=STREAMING"&gt;</code> </pre> <br>  By inserting this link into your browser, you will get the playback of the file by the browser‚Äôs built-in player, or simply by downloading it to the download folder. <br>  In this link there are several parameters associated with the settings utorrent <br>  webui.allow_pairing <br>  webui.proxy_auth <br>  webui.token_auth <br>  But since half of the parameters in the link do not work (everything related to hashes), you can shorten it to <pre> <code class="html hljs xml"> http://127.0.0.1:15906/proxy?sid=2&amp;file=0</code> </pre>  If this is inserted into the browser, the same thing happens as with the full link.  The working parameters of the link: <br>  sid = torrent number (can be any, is given utorrent when adding a torrent). <br>  file = file number (it seems to be constant, assigned according to the position in the Path column) <br>  15906 - selected port in utorrent settings <br><br>  This is where the question arises: ‚ÄúAnd what can we do with all this?‚Äù For the time being, it will probably turn out to be a little fantasy and experiment.  In principle, you can play with these settings yourself and see how they work.  For example, how can you use this http-server embedded in the program: <br><br><h5>  Transfer files directly to http </h5>  To do this, you must have a white static or dynamic IP on the Internet or at least on the local network, as well as the port specified in the utorrent settings.  In the copied links 127.0.0.1 need to be replaced with your Internet or local IP. <br><pre> <code class="html hljs xml">http://44.0.5.15:15906/proxy?sid=2&amp;file=0</code> </pre> <br>  Depending on whether you are going to transfer files to everyone or your favorites, you can enable or disable the webui.proxy_auth option in the settings.  If enabled, before opening the page utorrent may ask to be authorized.  Therefore, in the beginning, do not forget to enter the name and password in <b>the</b> utorrent <b>web interface</b> settings (guest login does not work) <br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">authorization</b> <div class="spoiler_text"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/8dc/016/b33/8dc016b33b21e3e22041be09087b3894.jpg" alt="image"><br></div></div><br>  If webui.proxy_auth is disabled, the content will become available to everyone without a pop-up authorization window. <br><br><h5>  Sequential downloading and viewing of torrent media files </h5><br>  As you already guessed at first, the name of the ‚ÄúCopy Stream URL‚Äù option itself and all the copied links from IP 127.0.0.1 are made only for playing downloadable content on the same computer.  However, why developers had to do so hard (with the built-in http server) is not entirely clear ... <br>  Interestingly the mechanism of the client on such links.  For example, you download a torrent file from the tracker and launch it in utorrent, set the task to stop (do not download), then copy the Copy Stream link URL of any file from the list and paste this link into your browser.  As soon as the browser follows the link in utorrent, the process of sequential downloading of parts of only this file is started, with a gradual transfer to the browser.  If the browser stops loading and / or closes the browser program altogether, utorrent will also respond by stopping the task. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/c7d/095/3b7/c7d0953b70aa735b4908c094e894be71.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><h5>  base site or directory in a p2p network </h5><br>  New utorrent features were noticed and The Pirate Bay <a href="http://www.piratebayuk.co.uk/setup.php">www.piratebayuk.co.uk/setup.php</a> But somehow everything is difficult for them there with usability. <br><blockquote>  Step 2. Install and configure xampp <br>  Download and Install xampp.  (Visit the Xampp homepage here).  Once Installed go to: Start-&gt; All Programs-&gt; Apache Friends-&gt; XAMPP-&gt; XAMPP Control Panel.  Then complete the following operations: </blockquote><br><br>  Unfortunately, utorrent does not work quite like a web server, but rather like a file http server.  Accordingly, it can load only files from the p2p network, then the browser takes these files from utorrent and displays them on its page.  In addition, the downloaded torrent with files on different utorrent will have a different sid =, but file = must be the same, since the names and number of files in the torrent will all be the same. <br><br>  In order to transfer the site to torrents, you need to make the global editing mechanism sid = in the links in the form of a user script or an extension in the browser that each user installs.  And also in the torrent file will need to put an incredibly huge pile of html pages for each distribution.  Another thing is if a special program for viewing is installed on the user's computer, which is able to work using utorrent links.  In the program settings the user could specify his sid = torrent.  The display of online distributions on the tracker and in a special program can be approximately the same both in appearance and in content.  The total weight of files downloaded by the user of such an archive will be significantly less than if the entire archive were downloaded.  The user should not and will not download / store topics on the computer that are not interesting to him.  But to distribute the parts stored in them to those he is interested in. <br>  The contents of the site ahiv can be divided into several torrent files, and not to push everything into one.  So in the main torrent file there will be a file / files with all links of the ‚Äúsite map‚Äù, the rest of the torrent files will fall into a certain category and store in themselves as files with links to the description files (screenshots, text, magnet links, etc.) and for example, the files of posters and screenshots (although, again, they can be separated into separate torrent file (s), with the ability to specify additional sid =). <br>  Oh dreams, dreams ... <br><br><h5>  Automatic update of torrent files </h5><br>  Unfortunately, this topic is not fully investigated and investigated, since my programming knowledge is approximately zero. <br>  Maybe one of you will be able to explore this topic and find out how this mechanism should work.  I would be grateful if you share your thoughts on this. <br><br>  The ability to automatically update the job in the client has been added to utorrent 3.4.  So by downloading a torrent file of a series from the tracker, in the future you can not follow the release of new series and update distribution on the forum, but immediately receive an updated torrent and new series. <br>  In the process of creating a torrent file (with a special program) or in the <b>torrent Properties of the</b> utorrent task, the http link of the torrent file update is specified. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/248/6fa/303/2486fa303827cff85da67dc8e57b6a36.jpg" alt="image"><br>  After restarting the client, a blue ‚Äúdot‚Äù will appear near the task, meaning that utorrent periodically polls the site for downloading a new torrent file. <br>  In the utorrent itself you can see the updates for each torrent (date and files) <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/6bf/6e0/85b/6bf6e085b8d38a9d5a1ee25c73b4c0ca.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Utorrent developers have published a special manual <a href="http://bittorrent.org/beps/bep_0039.html">bittorrent.org/beps/bep_0039.html</a> <br>  It also turned out to get their experimental torrent file, which inside contains the corresponding entries in the info section. <br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">entrails</b> <div class="spoiler_text"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/456/4d7/2d1/4564d72d1c6cb615cb34760aac6a7575.jpg" alt="image"><br></div></div><br>  At the time when I got this torrent file, the update link was downloaded <br><pre> <code class="hljs json">{ <span class="hljs-attr"><span class="hljs-attr">"message"</span></span>: <span class="hljs-string"><span class="hljs-string">"no update"</span></span>, <span class="hljs-attr"><span class="hljs-attr">"success"</span></span>: <span class="hljs-literal"><span class="hljs-literal">true</span></span> }</code> </pre><br>  In correspondence with the developer utorrent it turned out to pull out only that <br><blockquote>  For the torrent to be updated, you can‚Äôt have to download it. <br><br>  "Collections" key or "similar" key is described in: <br>  <a href="http://www.bittorrent.org/beps/bep_0038.html">www.bittorrent.org/beps/bep_0038.html</a> <br><br>  update-url is described in: <br>  <a href="http://www.bittorrent.org/beps/bep_0039.html">www.bittorrent.org/beps/bep_0039.html</a> <br><br>  the signing is described in: <br>  <a href="http://www.bittorrent.org/beps/bep_0035.html">www.bittorrent.org/beps/bep_0035.html</a> <br><br>  thanks, <br><br>  -Jeanette </blockquote><br><h5>  Other unexplored settings utorrent 3.4.x </h5><br>  One of the interesting options will probably be vpn.dark_mode.  If you turn it on, the client loses the usual connection with the trackers and peers.  What actually should happen in order to "not burn" IP.  If you logically develop the idea further, it should work approximately like remote.utorrent.com, with the only difference that some server must be a proxy server and a tracker at the same time.  That is, when this option is enabled, utorrent should download / distribute only through this server.  However, other peers should also, in theory, enable this option. <br>  However, it was experimentally impossible to force this option to work. <br><br>  Mysterious and intimidating setting is distributed_share.enable and its hidden hidden settings (SHIFT + F2).  There is a suspicion that Bittorrent is doing some kind of social network with p2p elements ... </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/251625/">https://habr.com/ru/post/251625/</a></p>
