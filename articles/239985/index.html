  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Overview of mobile applications for learning English</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/ea7/238/3ed/ea72383ed4f64a1fb65d33331612cbba.png"></div><br>  Autumn has come.  The period when summer ended and school and university studies began.  But knowledge of the English language is relevant for all age groups and now is the time to start learning it.  To do this, you need to sit back at the books?  Textbooks are nice, but painfully boring and now they can be replaced.  It is much more fun to learn English by playing it.  In this article, we will select programs for learning English that can work on both iOS and Android. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h1>  <a href="http://www.engwords.net/ru">EngCards</a> </h1><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/228/e17/41e/228e1741e7c244cfab50dc8a63ccf447.png"></div><br>  First, you need to replenish vocabulary.  An application for iOS and Android called ‚ÄúEngCards‚Äù (formerly ‚ÄúEnglish with English Cards Free‚Äù) helps you learn <a href="http://www.engwords.net/ru">English words</a> surprisingly quickly and permanently.  In the annex there are 3500 cards in the form of English words and pictures with professional pronunciation from a native speaker.  Cards are one of the oldest and most effective methods for memorizing English words. <br><br><ul><li>  Words are chosen for all levels of knowledge of the English language in accordance with the courses of the same name: Elementary, Pre-intermediate, Intermediate and Upper Intermediate + bonus in the form of basic words (nouns, adjectives, numerals and verbs) </li><li>  All words in the application are translated into 79 languages, including Ukrainian, Belarusian and Russian. </li><li>  According to the creators of the application, their special method of learning will help to learn English words once and for all. </li></ul><br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/5bc/1da/52f/5bc1da52f94b467a92facc1f734ccb8f.png"></div><br>  The main "chip" in the program is customizable periods of repetition of words.  As is well known, in order to memorize, and not temporarily memorize, the subject of study, and in our case these words, must be repeated periodically.  In the program, these periods are set in the settings.  By default there are 5. If a word was learned in the exercise ‚Äútest‚Äù (you need to perform 5 stars) or ‚Äúwrite it yourself‚Äù (you need to execute 4 stars), all correctly selected and written words will be considered learned.  Words will disappear from memorization for 2 hours, then return after 2 hours to memorize.  When re-memorizing the word will disappear for a day, then a week, 2 months and a year in accordance with the settings.

There is some kind of zest in it.  You start to learn words and delays for a long time.  You don't notice how time flies. ‚Äù <br><br>  <b>Pros: the</b> original method of learning words, support 79 languages ‚Äã‚Äãof the world <br>  <b>Cons:</b> almost none <br>  <b>Rating:</b> 5/5 <br>  <b>Website:</b> <a href="http://www.engwords.net/ru">www.engwords.net</a> <br><br><h1>  <a href="http://lingualeo.com/ru">LinguaLeo</a> </h1><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/a61/9ea/e92/a619eae92e6a424f967964eb3366fd15.jpg"></div><br>  LinguaLeo is already quite an ‚Äúold‚Äù and experienced player in the market of applications for learning English.  The main ‚Äústronghold‚Äù of the service is the website, which presents various training courses, trainings, video tutorials and training sessions, including paid ones. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/a13/825/518/a13825518a6a4cbc97dbaf703cb6b109.jpg"></div><br>  The mobile application LinguaLeo reboots a bit (for whom as) a boring learning process and brings a competitive element into it.  So, the application consists of several parts.  In the "jungle" are available thousands of different texts, whose main task is to teach us new words.  A translation of a word can be obtained by clicking on it. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/115/af9/f9e/115af9f9ed414ac0b9403160c072d2bc.jpg"></div><br>  There are courses on all present times and members of the offer.  However, access to most opens only for an additional fee.  There are also various thematic dictionaries, exercises on the correct pronunciation (without comparison), training and also grammar tests. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/874/94e/72e/87494e72e0f2488eb2dbc4ac0cbc1589.jpg"></div><br>  The competition is created here at the expense of the system of levels, getting that, you can discover new types of training.  Or you can open them all at once by paying the n-th sum from the Google Play wallet. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/76c/ce8/cad/76cce8cad60c4d8eb8bb214ea335c688.jpg"></div><br>  In general, Lingualeo is a good service for learning English, only the application seemed a bit childish. <br><br>  <b>Pros: a</b> variety of exercises <br>  <b>Minuses:</b> ‚Äúchildren's‚Äù style of performance, no conversational exercises, the presence of a kind of ‚Äúdonat‚Äù <br>  <b>Rating:</b> 4/5 <br>  <b>Website:</b> <a href="http://lingualeo.com/ru">www.lingualeo.com</a> <br><br><h1>  <a href="http://www.busuu.com/ru">Busuu</a> </h1><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/137/c09/cf3/137c09cf339a4b43b534fb9e415f5edc.jpg"></div><br>  According to the developers, Busuu includes over 30,000 words and phrases in more than 150 topics.  And all this - in the eleven languages ‚Äã‚Äãof the world. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/8e0/d0a/42d/8e0d0a42dddf4c94b268d0866d9d0705.jpg"></div><br>  All courses are divided by complexity - from basic to advanced.  Depending on it, the course may include exercises on reading, writing small texts, polls, vocabulary tests and dialogues (listen, pronounce, compare).  Worthy feature that distinguishes Busuu from competitors - the ability to send a practical exercise (a letter, for example) to check the Internet community. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/50e/d64/3b1/50ed643b11d744b4ad08726efe352a0c.jpg"></div><br>  At the end of all lessons (in any language) there is a bonus ‚ÄúTravel course‚Äù for those who travel and do not want to learn the language ‚Äúcompletely‚Äù.  And among the options there is a convenient "reminder" for those who want to work on a schedule. <br>  The truth is not without a fly in the ointment - as in LinguaLeo, there is also a ‚Äúdonate‚Äù here, for which you can buy individual lessons.  And he bites much more here - an annual license will cost almost $ 70.  The truth of such paid lessons is not much. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/08f/f41/57a/08ff4157a2804af48d381dfcf19f4edf.jpg"></div><br>  In general, Busuu is a very convenient and nicely designed application.  Given the strong support of the network community, it can be recommended for use, but the presence of payments does not allow Busuu to give the maximum rating. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/552/34c/d33/55234cd334224535b0d899b9688ef31d.jpg"></div><br>  <b>Pros: a</b> huge community, a large number of supported languages <br>  <b>Cons:</b> Donate <br>  <b>Rating:</b> 4/5 <br>  <b>Website:</b> <a href="http://www.busuu.com/ru">www.busuu.com</a> <br><br>  <b><i>The previous three applications were more or less serious, and allowed to start learning English from scratch.</i></b>  <b><i>The following two are focused on those who are already familiar with this language and just want to improve their ‚Äúskill‚Äù in grammar or pronunciation.</i></b> <br><br><h1>  <a href="http://www.ticwow.com/">Pumpkin Eng</a> </h1><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/4f8/0e1/afb/4f80e1afb8404baea3f6056cbb038ccb.jpg"></div><br>  When you first start, "Pumpkin" is a little striking in its originality, because instead of memorizing words or writing letters, we are offered to play ... tic-tac-toe sentences!  Agree, a very original system.  Moreover, even if you are good at times with the English grammar, then you also need to think about the strategy - it's tic-tac-toe! <br><br>  In practice, it looks like this: you start the game with a computer in a certain ‚Äútime‚Äù.  Before you are grids of 9 cells ‚Äî lines-times or verbs and columns ‚Äî types (positive, negative, question) or times (in a game with verb tenses).  You click in the cell where you want to "walk" and choose from the three proposed the correct option. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/5eb/1fd/b11/5eb1fdb11a754c2d952accf30d41b52b.jpg"></div><br>  Moving on to the next levels of the game, we discover new words that will be used in sentences.  Plus, during any game you can get help-infographics for all existing times. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/bef/a70/971/befa70971cbb422cbfd917fff4bd81e7.jpg"></div><br>  As if all of the above were not good, but in the free version they will not let you go further than the first level - you will have to purchase an application (about $ 3-4). <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/0e7/bf5/598/0e7bf5598b304ec8a948e5b5ccc97fc6.jpg"></div><br>  In general, the "Pumpkin" account I really liked - for the most part precisely because of its originality.  But the need to pay compared to what competitors offer for free, greatly reduces its attractiveness in the eyes of the user. <br><br>  <b>Pros:</b> original learning system <br>  <b>Cons:</b> in fact, the application is paid <br>  <b>Rating:</b> 3/5 <br>  <b>Website:</b> <a href="http://www.ticwow.com/">www.ticwow.com</a> <br><br><h1>  <a href="http://osc-apps.com/ru/apps/34-english-tongue-twisters">Carton Tongue Twister</a> </h1><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/c74/fae/af8/c74faeaf8bfe4cd1a6af038de0bea6b6.jpg"></div><br>  No matter how well you write in English, the ability to correctly pronounce words is also worth a lot.  And the guys from the Online Science Classroom believe that the best way to learn the correct pronunciation is tongue twisters. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/842/bd2/29e/842bd229e5094e5791a5a3b8314e7870.jpg"></div><br>  I‚Äôll go straight ahead and note that only the first eight tongue twisters are free in the application, the rest will have to be bought for ridiculous $ 2.  But in this case, they are absolutely not a pity, because the actual patter skits themselves are interactive cartoons drawn by hand.  And this childish-clumsy style of performance and funny animation looks very cute. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/cac/dc7/942/cacdc794217a4f8b8e735e21194d0250.jpg"></div><br>  In total, there are 28 tongue twisters in the application (I would like more, at least 50), which can be pronounced at different levels of difficulty.  Plus there is such a very useful option as recording your own pronunciation.  Recorded, compared, saw the error. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/151/393/c32/151393c329244bdfa475a340f4e52f08.jpg"></div><br>  Especially about the application to tell nothing more, just try it - you will love it. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/cad/4c6/d11/cad4c6d11d5a4f44b4e9f96d9ee12448.jpg"></div><br>  <b>Pros:</b> stylish design lessons <br>  <b>Cons:</b> not enough tongue twisters <br>  <b>Rating:</b> 4/5 <br>  <b>Website:</b> <a href="http://osc-apps.com/ru/apps/34-english-tongue-twisters">www.osc-apps.com</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/239985/">https://habr.com/ru/post/239985/</a></p>
