I looked at their site - theorists and educators, business coaches, who studied in other countries will train post-Soviet engineers to teach modern schoolchildren the multiplication table.  This was just not enough for the education system, so that after the Unified State Examination, where the system was collapsed, non-governmental organizations flew like ravens and began to teach others to teach others ... 30 people would save Russia and her education ... cheers comrades.  (‚ÄúWe will boost your salary by 20 tr., And let your colleagues work as before, and we will gather you in groups of 3, so that you don‚Äôt do it darkly alone‚Äù, it‚Äôs strange that the teachers themselves didn‚Äôt run there ... or ran ?!)

      By virtue of education, although I do not work in the specialty "Teacher of Informatics and Mathematics", I could not read past opinions and programs that are based in the minds and already have a reflection in reality, so as not to dilute this event with an additional opinion. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Within the framework of modern education, they just don‚Äôt think up anything to improve the quality of knowledge of the wards, and teachers select interesting young people for pennies and computerize classes with a limited budget and introduce state programs, but something is wrong with our education anyway. <br><br>  The reason is as banal as the day and cannot be solved in a narrow circle.  The reason is the lack of synchronization between the learning process and the process of self-development, the financing process and the life of an ordinary teacher, assessment of the current state of affairs and assessment of the intended result, plan and fact, what you want and what you can ... all the standard reasons when ‚Äúnot glued‚Äù. <br><br>  1) The most important issue.  As in the song ... "low budget". <br>  The most important problem is that a specialist in any field who has the knowledge and skills (which he can pass on to others) at school will not be able to move up the career ladder or be a paid specialist.  Current schools - this is the place where they work "for the idea." <br><br>  As I remember, a conversation with a physics teacher on one of the practices - ‚ÄúI have 40 years experience ... Guys ... run away from here ... it's a bad thing.‚Äù  And really a bad job - it's difficult to feed a family doing it only for 1 bet.  At 2 rates you can already live, but the working day is about 12 hours (and Saturday is working). <br><br>  And how much money is given for the ‚Äúobligatory site‚Äù, which the informatics teacher must ... create, update information, add Wishlist.  And all this already for 500 wooden per month. <br><br>  School principals are always at work, they always think ... where do we get money for school repairs, who will keep accounts, questions with the board of trustees.  The last thing they think about is the quality of education (this is certainly not everywhere, and not only where parents are well-fledged). <br><br>  2) Attracting young professionals - an invention to attract to schools for jobs. <br>  Often, on enthusiasm, many young teachers, rolling up their sleeves, begin to teach children right and left.  Suddenly, it turns out that the plan, the program on the subject is not being implemented, what is being studied and how, only the specialist himself understands, and the director, who at first was happy with the excellent estimates given by this very young teacher, suddenly understands the catastrophic nature of the matter and the children joy ‚Äùplus‚Äú enthusiasm ‚Äùreceive a dose of the usual education in order to complete the program.  Time is spent and the young specialist is confused. (They usually quit, or other schools intercept these, which take and control innovation more seriously).  And by the way, innovations are very rarely supported by local municipalities, because it is impossible to monitor the implementation of standards, if they change everything. <br><br>  Experienced teachers are also constantly retrained, but as horrible.  And not because the young theorists, coaches and others are verses.  Quite the contrary - they are strong theorists, but real and living children run around the school (especially the post-Soviet ones).  From experience, I will say that even for teachers with experience, forcing children to at least concentrate after a change is an achievement. (You can keep track of the Brownian movement, but you can stop it in any way). <br><br>  3) Pedagogical universities / technical schools graduate specialists. <br>  Within the framework of the subject areas they teach in different ways, here already and innovations tell and creative piggy banks expand and teach everything from how to behave, think like a schoolchild, and even conduct any extracurricular activities.  It is here that they say that the schools have the old and what needs to be brought in new.  To teach is everything.  Basically it is the level of knowledge of the teacher that suffers, for example, computer science, which, due to pedagogical peculiarities, masters the whole range of technologies with mileage. <br><br>  So why not go to school? .. <br><br>  Everything is simple - as many teachers as they graduate are not needed (both because of demographic recessions and because schools have low staff turnover, and new schools are rarely opened. I don‚Äôt say the situation in cities to millions of people, but in my usual the city is so).  Moreover, everyone wants such a graduate to be clever, preferably with a red diploma and "vydelyatsya" until the total mass of graduates disperse in search of work. <br>  We should also mention work in villages and villages - there is always a shortage and they cannot find anyone.  It is becoming clearer and clearer - young people have few prospects at a distance from the city and many people choose to work as a manager in MegaMTSBilaynoEldoradoSvyaznomyTtoTam, just to stay in the city. <br><br>  I guarantee that if we apply the economic model of the law ‚ÄúDemand-Proposal‚Äù, then the factors affecting such a conditional ‚Äúmarket‚Äù will be the same. <br><br>  4) True Engineer or True Educator? <br>  There are many opinions about who is cooler.  The engineer has a point of contact of knowledge with the subject area, practical skills.  But the teacher has the practice of communicating with a set of children of different ages, psychological aspects of upbringing and the ability to form both basic knowledge and knowledge, skills and abilities, in particular, in the subject area. <br><br>  The conclusion suggests itself - teachers for elementary and middle classes, engineers for senior ones.  And all would be nothing, but such a division is also fraught.  It is often more profitable to mix in one subject area and those and others.  I know a hybrid representative - an engineer who managed to work and who, by virtue of his love for children, embodies the image of an ideal informatics teacher with great experience (which he actually proved by becoming ‚ÄúTeacher of the Year‚Äù). <br>  This method allows you to show any subject brighter, more interesting and more logical.  But there are few such people, and few in schools, since such people achieve great success in their careers and the educational segment does not attract coins. <br><br>  5) The introduction of new technologies. <br>  Recently, interactive whiteboards have become commonplace in the regions.  It seems as visibility increases, the interest of the student grows in front of the eyes and the teacher is easier to work with blanks without wasting time drawing posters, flourishes on the blackboard, and just spoiling the hands of chalk.  As a result, this important innovation also falls on the school teacher in computer science, is not paid at all and the boards are bought for a lot of money (dust particles are blown off very carefully, you can touch it, but it is not necessary).  Nobody taught teachers how to use teachers, few boards, and most importantly, no one in the ministry thought to make lesson templates on subjects to make life easier for teachers ‚Äî sort of redo your methodical ideas yourself, which didn‚Äôt cause a corresponding joy to teachers. <br><br>  In this area, there are so many opportunities for a qualitative transformation of the educational system that one can simply wonder how much the lesson is changing from its technical transformation.  This includes the addition of necessary practice and additional interest and convenience for teachers and parents and children, centralized testing of knowledge - after all, you can unload the teacher by creating a center to develop methods for the teacher, learning tasks, statistical methods for testing entire layers of knowledge and skills. pupils - and all this is possible thanks to the informatization of the whole educational process; synchronization is possible with what the Ministry‚Äôs standards can convey.  But everything is blocked by scant crumbs of the RF budget for education. <br><br>  As a result, we can safely say only one thing - In our country, with due attention recently, unfortunately, the education system is considered only from the point of view of rights and obligations in official documents.  Approximately in the same way as an artist "does not need" to know mathematics, so the state now "does not need" to do more than in official documents.  And it is difficult to assume that non-governmental organizations will be able to solve so many problems that are inherent in the real state.  sector.  One hope for those people who are willing to teach (or will be willing to teach) because of their capabilities, regardless of the complexity, even if not so much as we, the state, would like theorists from non-governmental organizations or themselves. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/295626/">https://habr.com/ru/post/295626/</a></p>
