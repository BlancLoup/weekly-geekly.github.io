Has the ‚Äúfree coupon cheese‚Äù loved by everyone really become another tool for fraudsters? <br><br>  The number of people ‚Äúcaught‚Äù on coupons is growing every day: Chinese consumer goods instead of real goods, overestimation of prices by two times with a subsequent 50% discount, online shopping - one-day shops replenished the arsenal of coupon swindlers. <br><br>  In this article we want to talk about a new kind of coupon service with <a href="http://chelopon.ru/">helopon.ru</a> . <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Initially, the coupon business was based on attracting new customers at the expense of a large one-time discount.  So is it possible to transfer the locomotive switch of distrust of coupon services on the righteous rails?

      The idea of ‚Äã‚Äãcreating a site for coupons from people or "chelopons" came to us recently.  Our inspirers were the creators of the series ‚ÄúThe Big Bang Theory‚Äù in the person of his eccentric hero Sheldon Cooper, who gave the first ‚Äúchelopon‚Äù to the planetarium to his girlfriend.  At that moment the idea was born to make coupons another original means of communication. <br><br>  Invite a girl to a restaurant, call friends for a birthday, or just give a 100% discount for happiness - another use for a coupon. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/ba3/253/1b3/ba32531b37eaad3e0fa00c4929ac7fdb.png"><br><br>  In our project, we tried to solve the main problem of coupon sites - this is charging for a coupon.  If you have ever used a discount service, then you should be familiar with the feeling of anxiety on a number of issues: what if the service is not of high quality, but have I already paid for it?  How to get a refund if I change my mind or do not have time for the promotion?  And I don‚Äôt want to miss a really honest, good deal with good reviews! <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/389/845/892/3898458920a87cdf86fc551b3db27d78.png"><br><br>  Our concept is a free coupon.  We do not pay for advertising, which we saw on the street or for booklet, obtained at the intersection?  Now, taking a coupon, you risk nothing. <br><br>  Placing offers on the site is also free for everyone, so you can significantly reduce the financial costs of holding shares without sharing revenue with the coupon service. <br><br>  Very often, coupon sites hide comments with negative feedback about the promotion.  Because of this, coupon holders remain in the dark about existing pitfalls.  Similar reviews by our service will not be deleted, and the organizers of the action will have a chance to show their ability to resolve conflicts peacefully. <br><br>  Our project does not need a large number of managers or a branch network.  We will not chase after the number of coupon shares in order to cover the costs incurred, but concentrate on selecting truly honest offers. <br><br>  Doubtful promotions of online stores, created a few days before the announcement of the discount, sellers of goods that do not need advertising, travel agencies with suspiciously cheap trips will not appear in the publication. <br><br>  If the action is good, then people use it, and the advertising works, and if this is another ‚Äúdivorce‚Äù, then the organizer punished himself: not fulfilling the declared promises, thereby obtaining anti-advertising of his activities.  Respect for losing is easy, and you should know how to earn ... <br><br>  Let's return the coupons their good appointment - discount, gift, joy! <br>  <a href="http://chelopon.ru/deal/schaste-dlya-vseh-darom-i-pust-nikto-ne-uydet-obizhennyy">And all the coupon for luck!</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/144746/">https://habr.com/ru/post/144746/</a></p>
