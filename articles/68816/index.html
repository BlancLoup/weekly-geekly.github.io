It would seem that in the morning, when I went to my office, I know what I have to do, and I even know how and with what sequence this should be done, and everything seems to be as good.  But after several hours of ‚Äúhard work,‚Äù I come to the conclusion that even 20% of the planned has not been done.  How so? <br><br>  Thinking over why this is happening, I watched my behavior for several weeks (well, observation is very conditional, since it seems to me to observe myself completely impossible) and found out what prevents me from multitasking and parallelization of these tasks.  What I mean?  It would seem quite logical if possible to simultaneously perform two or more tasks, so it seems that time is saved.  For example, I know that I need to find pictures on a given topic, send SMS to three people, write a post for a Habr, make several calls, draw up an additional agreement and acts to the contract number n.  At first, a quick glance you can combine some tasks and do it simultaneously.  For example, if the calls are not official, you can make them while preparing tea for a break, why waste time for calls and SMS separately, there is no time, as a result when the break in the mind comes another dominant and no calls are made.  To find pictures is also easy, at the same time I will look at the mail, while the pictures open.  Oh-oh, a new post on Habr√© (forum, etc.) on how to compile an add.  agreements are just what I need.  And in addition to the article there are a few examples and links to other resources - but I also need to write additional agreements, I need to thoroughly investigate everything - and so on.  I think that for many a familiar situation.  And the search for pictures is somewhere in the open tab and has been downloaded a million times.  At the end of the day, it turns out that although the tasks are super easy and not so much time is needed for execution, some of them still remain unfulfilled. <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  In this regard, I have decided for myself something that I share with.  I want to note that I am not ‚Äúthe perfection of accomplishment‚Äù and I only try to carry out the assigned tasks, sometimes with varying success, but nevertheless the following tips help me.

Those.  if I'm looking for pictures, then no ‚Äúzyrnu mail at the same time, still the pictures are loaded‚Äù, ‚Äúoh, I forgot, I need to send a postcard to my mother, thank you for a rambler instantly‚Äù, etc.  There should not be distracting, not related to the current task cases. <br><br>  Secondly - to move on to the next task, only after you have completed the previous one.  If it (the previous task) is large and requires several days or sittings for a compic, then it should be divided into subtasks, etc.  An elephant must be eaten piece by piece and consistently - as popular thought says. <br><br>  Thirdly, it is easier to relate to the tasks.  In one film there was a phrase - ‚Äúget on a boat, do your work and go back home‚Äù.  A lot of distractions and affairs appear from unwillingness to complete the task.  There are things that I do not like to do in my work, but nevertheless no one will do them for me, then I say to myself ‚Äúget in the boat, do your work ...‚Äù <br><br>  Here are three simple principles that help me complete my tasks.  Yes, and more, these tips are for people who manage their time themselves.  If you have a boss, then everything is easier. <br><br>  Here, in principle, you can still write and tell a lot, but, the simpler is better, the more complicated.  Behind this I take my leave ... <br><br>  PS: Printed from <a href="http://www.blog-codera.net/">your own blog</a> , do not consider it a crosspost. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/68816/">https://habr.com/ru/post/68816/</a></p>
