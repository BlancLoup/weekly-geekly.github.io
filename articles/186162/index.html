  <section class="page js-page"><h1>SEO myths</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  One of the most important rules of PR is not to affect the negative in your own content.  It will simply increase the number of contacts with harmful information from the audience.  And it is almost impossible to justify oneself: even the strongest arguments will be perceived by only a small percentage of rational people aimed at receiving impartial information and forming an adequate picture of reality.  But most simply "sediment remains."  Therefore, the right strategy for a politician is this: if a particular person in a particular place denigrates it with specific (albeit fictional) facts, you should not give him a link and write: ‚ÄúLook, what a nonsense!  In fact, everything is wrong, and this is why ... "On the contrary, it is necessary either to ignore the attacks, or vaguely mention them: they say," the enemy does not sleep, produces insanity, but I will continue to save the world "... <br><br>  But we are not politicians and are not afraid to discuss search engine promotion.  Because SeoPult has disarming statistics - 290 000 sites successfully attract visitors with our help.  The high ROI of search promotion is an opportunity for a huge number of small and medium-sized businesses to work successfully and generate profits, create jobs. <br><br>  All of the above is intended to once again refute the first and foremost SEO myth: promotion is something bad (recently people have, however, found it difficult to present actual arguments in favor of this point of view).  Doubters refer to our article <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/seopult/blog/156797/">"Apology SEO"</a> , and here we will continue to discuss the specific misconceptions webmasters and site owners.

    <a name="habracut"></a><br><h5>  Content does not need to be written, can be synonymous </h5><br><img height="500" src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/30f/b22/e47/30fb22e47bbbdd3d96a4a17bd7419264.jpg" width="500"><br><br>  For content theft, search engines impose sanctions on sites, while they are well able to search for duplicates: easy rewriting and synonymization will not help to hide from the All-Watching Eye.  All modern automatic generation and rewriting tools turn the text into unreadable garbage (which leads to zero conversion of visitors into buyers).  The deep manual rewriting, which is being tested using Copyscape, is essentially the writing of a new text and is not much cheaper than developing content from scratch.  The conclusion is obvious: forget about content theft.  If you take the article, put a link to the source (while not forgetting that the page with the outgoing link and the copied content can not be promoted to the TOP at any competitive request - the search engine will simply prefer the original). <br><br><h5>  It is necessary to immediately purchase links for all the money in order to quickly reach the TOP </h5><br>  In order to combat one-day sites seeking to capture the best positions only due to a one-time billing of the budget for links, the search engines introduced the concept of ‚Äúreference explosion‚Äù.  There are a lot of links at once - pessimization or even a ban, especially if there is no particular reason, and there are no truly authoritative links among the referring sites.  Obviously, if all the leading online publications have written about your site, the ‚Äúreference explosion‚Äù sanction does not threaten you, but if you buy a lot of links, the effect will be the opposite of what you expected.  Purchase of links can be relatively fast, but in no case should not exceed the empirically calculated "natural dynamics".  Its values ‚Äã‚Äãare determined specifically for the subject and under the parameters of the pages promoted.  With manual advancement, there will always be an ‚Äúeye‚Äù orientation, only large automatic promotion systems have data from experiments with purchasing dynamics. <br><br><h5>  Links from bad looking sites do not work. </h5><br>  Most sites are different, to say the least, not the highest quality and original design (and other visual parameters) - the same Wikipedia has a cult, but absolutely out-of-date design, which does not prevent it from being the most trust site on the Internet.  Of course, it is better to put a link from an ideal resource, but when promoting competitive inquiries, when a decent amount of links is required, it is simply unrealistic to buy everything on absolutely flawless donors.  Consequently, it is necessary to buy links not on nice-looking, but on effective, working, transmitting reference ‚Äúauthority‚Äù pages.  To identify them, you need to know exactly the actual parameters for the current version of search algorithms, conduct experiments, test purchases, etc.  Simply put, either to become a very advanced SEO-specialist himself, or to trust an automated system, focusing on its average performance.  SeoPult has more than 290,000 clients, their sites are taking the right positions, so our links work uniquely.  Complaints like ‚Äúlinks purchased on bad pages‚Äù have the answer: ‚Äúthe result is, it means donors from the point of view of search engines are not bad - they just do not like you personally visually‚Äù. <br><br><h5>  There are programs for getting free links. </h5><br>  Directory Run, programs for automatically spamming reference forums and guestbooks with links are methods that flow seamlessly from the gray area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe SEO to the black.  Not only is there a risk of imposing sanctions on the site being promoted, but also the effectiveness of ‚Äúfree donors‚Äù instantly drops to zero (and below - links from them begin to cause harm).  The fact is that on such sites more links are immediately put down than the search engines can tolerate, and they are sent to the ban.  However, there is an interesting method of free (more precisely, cash-free) promotion - you can contact good thematic sites and provide them with articles and other content in exchange for placing links in this content. <br><br><h5>  You can engage in "seasonal promotion" </h5><br>  If you have an online store of products for giving, there is a great temptation to try to save money and go to the TOP by specialized requests only during the season.  But this trick will not work: search engines do not like fluctuations of the reference mass (namely, buying and renting links will have to deal with in order to save money).  The older the link from the donor, the longer it points to the recipient page of your site, the more stable the link, the better.  Even ‚Äúflashing‚Äù for one or two days can seriously harm the dynamics of advancement, and the opinion of search engines about a resource, which periodically loses most of the incoming link mass, will become negative.  In short, seasonal advance is a thing of the past: now you need to stand in the TOP all year round.  And if your season is very short, you need to calculate the cost of attracting the target visitor (and the percentage of conversion) to determine whether to use search engine promotion at all.  Perhaps contextual advertising - even, it would seem, at a high cost per click in seasonal subjects, will still be more profitable. <br><br><h5>  You can wind the behavioral ranking factors </h5><br>  Search engines pay great attention to behavioral factors - the time of finding live users on the site, the depth of page views, etc.  However, attempts to manipulate them by sending scripts to the site that imitate human activity lead to the imposition of tough sanctions.  Search engines have many ways to reliably distinguish a robot from a human.  Do not risk, for trying to wind the PF ban is almost guaranteed. <br><br><h5>  You can reach the TOP only through internal optimization </h5><br>  Sure, no problem!  But only if you want to take first place on the request of "lambdobaric py-pyuzator" and similar super bass.  To enter the TOP on any requests, implying a little bit serious competition, optimization of internal ranking factors will be a necessary, but not sufficient condition.  TOP10 modern search engines - for prepared sites with a good incoming link weight. <br><br><h5>  ‚ÄúI‚Äôll make a website, in a couple of months I‚Äôll go to the TOP and start selling irons in the thousands!‚Äù </h5><br>  The newly created site, especially if it is located on a new domain without a positive history in this topic, will come out of the year, or even more, in the TOP on fairly competitive requests.  Filters for young sites prevent them from violating the established hierarchy through various kinds of dishonest practices.  To get into the company of leaders, you need to prove to the search engine the seriousness of their intentions, and slowly and gradually.  And before you capture the top ten, you can successfully work with contextual advertising. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/186162/">https://habr.com/ru/post/186162/</a></p>
