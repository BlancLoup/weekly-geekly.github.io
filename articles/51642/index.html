  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Parallels Summit 2009</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"> Our company hosted the <a href="http://www.parallels.com/ru/summit/agenda/">Parallels Summit</a> in Las Vegas, which, according to Western journalists, was much cooler than the most popular hosting event Hostingcon.  For those who do not know, Parallels has historically been involved in virtualization and automation software, which was most popular among hosters, service providers, and so on.  I would like to share how the representatives of the hosting industry see the development of the hosting industry, and of Parallels as well.  Sergey Belousov, the company's CEO, spoke about the most notable market trend - the movement to locate infrastructure remotely in huge computing ‚Äúclouds‚Äù that can be accessed via the Internet, as well as SaaS development trends. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  A lot of guests (partners, clients, journalists) gathered - more than 1000 participants.  By the way, for many people, holding an event in Las Vegas with so many guests in a difficult economic situation in the country said a lot - the media specifically mentioned this.  In Las Vegas, as nowhere else, the impact of the crisis was felt better.  Even taxi drivers complained about the decline in interest in the city. <br><br>  <i>Summit in full swing</i> <br><img src="http://blogs.parallels.com/.a/6a00e5503060a3883301053709f73e970b-800wi" alt="image"><br><br>  As already mentioned, Sergey Belousov spoke about the movement to locating the infrastructure remotely in huge computing ‚Äúclouds‚Äù that can be accessed via the Internet.  And if we take into account the formation and active development of several large and often proprietary data clouds (Google - <a href="http://www.e-xecutive.ru/knowledge/announcement/837338/">about which he has already spoken a lot</a> , Amazon, Salesforce, Microsoft, IBM), then for hosters and service providers the issues of creating their own clouds and optimization their work.  In the opinion and not without the help of Parallels, there is a way to not only increase efficiency, but also to reduce the huge production costs of such customers, and the main task here is to adapt and automate the services provided.  Companies must stop wasting money on developing their own systems for billing, order processing, account management, service management, etc.  This is an opportunity in the rapidly changing market conditions, if not to increase, then at least maintain its market share, expand the range of services offered and the client base and thereby increase revenue.

      <i>Sergey Belousov at the Parallels Summit 2009</i> <br><img src="http://blogs.parallels.com/.a/6a00e5503060a3883301053708f16c970b-800wi" alt="image"><br><br>  Abstracts of Sergey Belousov's speech: <a href="http://blogs.zdnet.com/virtualization/%3Fp%3D658">blogs.zdnet.com/virtualization/?p=658</a> <br><br>  Almost all participants in the discussion agreed that one of the most important consequences of the emergence of the concept of cloud computing would be that the infrastructure of hosted applications or hosting solutions - especially as an argument in favor of SaaS - would be taken for granted.  For example, in his speech, Andreas Gauger, former CEO, 1 &amp; 1 Internet, emphasized several times that the most appropriate strategy for hosting providers is to focus on achieving greater flexibility and the ability to quickly adapt and introduce new services.  Hosting providers should not waste time creating applications that they can buy ready-made.  He is practically echoed by Bernie Myerson, vice president of strategic alliances and CTO of Server Business, IBM, who said that hosting providers must now determine for themselves what they can do worst of all, and find who will do it for them .  Sounded theses of experts reflect the philosophy of Parallels, doing everything <a href="http://www.parallels.com/ru/products/">possible</a> so that its clients have all the necessary solutions to achieve these goals. <br><br>  For those who are especially interested - theses of some speakers: <br>  Summary of William McNee's speech (Saugatuck): <a href="http://www.thewhir.com/blog/Liam_Eagle/Parallels_Summit_Keynote_-_Bill_McNee">www.thewhir.com/blog/Liam_Eagle/Parallels_Summit_Keynote___Bill_McNee</a> , _Saugatuck <br><img src="http://blogs.parallels.com/.a/6a00e5503060a388330111684c0fff970c-800wi" alt="image"><br><br>  Abstracts of Dave Wright‚Äôs speech (Microsoft): <a href="http://www.thewhir.com/blog/Liam_Eagle/Parallels_Summit_Keynote_-_Dave_Wright">www.thewhir.com/blog/Liam_Eagle/Parallels_Summit_Keynote_-_Dave_Wright</a> , _Microsoft <br><img src="http://blogs.parallels.com/.a/6a00e5503060a3883301053711ef59970b-800wi" alt="image"><br><br>  At the summit, Parallels introduced new developments: Parallels Business Automation 4.4 solution, which is a kind of BSS system and mainly billing functions for hosting service providers, providers, ISVs interested in starting SaaS sales, automating existing workflows, such as ordering over the Internet , order processing, distribution channel management, marketing campaigns and campaigns, invoicing, tax calculation and fraud protection.  Also at the summit was presented Parallels Server Bare Metal.  This is a long-awaited decision of the company, because for a long time Parallels focused only on container virtualization technologies, and now it combines the capabilities of hypervisors and containers in one software.  As we say, the commercial version of Parallels Server bare metal will be presented during this year.  Parallels Virtual Automation 4.5 also attracted the attention of customers. It is a tool for managing a heterogeneous virtual infrastructure and supporting hypervisor / OS virtualization.  For those interested: <a href="http://www.virtualization.info/2009/02/parallels-previews-its-hypervisor-at.html">www.virtualization.info/2009/02/parallels-previews-its-hypervisor-at.html</a> <br><br>  All new developments of the company were available for demonstration in a specially equipped part of the exposition, where the guys from Parallels, wearing white doctor's robes, provided any technical assistance to their clients.  Ilya Baymetov, technical director of SaaS and the development of program-management division of Parallels Automation, who did not remove white attire, even in an informal setting, was especially notable.  In particular, he was noticed at a reception in honor of the launch of Parallels Plesk 9.0 (a new version of the control panel for hosting automation), held on the 64th floor of THE Hotel (No kidding, the hotel was called. Let the name of the hotel disappoint, but but the party turned out cool). <br><br>  <i>That's how we ‚Äútreated‚Äù our clients at the Parallels Plesk 9.0 party.</i> <br><img src="http://blogs.parallels.com/.a/6a00e5503060a3883301116847b274970c-800wi" alt="image"><br><br>  Of course, the official part of the summit was informatively powerful.  But besides this, it is not necessary to omit a very important and pleasant fact that Las Vegas is still the theme of parties, of which there are a great many. <br>  Immediately we must make a reservation that all Americans are absolute and the frequent guests of America unanimously expressed that Las Vegas is not at all like real America.  Here, everyone lives on the principle of ‚ÄúWhat happens in Vegas, stays in Vegas‚Äù.  Therefore, all these days were sick with a little insanity.  This is the influence of the city. <br><br>  <i>Vegas in all its glory</i> <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/289/83d/c19/28983dc1999bf41a175c381dfdf73c9b.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Of course, almost everyone who gets into this city understands that not playing in a casino would be the most terrible omission.  Casinos start at the airport.  Everyone plays here and sometimes even wins.  And we played.  Some of our colleagues won about 30 thousand dollars, and happiness was noted noisily.  He formulated the basic rules of experienced gamblers.  Rule number one.  Come to the casino to lose, not win.  Only such an installation should be so that you enjoy the game.  Rule number two.  Drink as little as possible while playing in a casino.  And you need to understand that the temptation to drink is great, because, no matter how much money you put on the bank, drinks in the casino are free.  Well, and rule number three.  This rule applies to those who are not averse to playing black jack (game up to 21 points).  The main thing is that you do not fall out 17. Such an alignment in the game is called the mother-in-law track - but in our mother-in-law (you know), because, having 17 points on the cards, you don‚Äôt You can ask the dealer for another card and have to stop, waiting for the card to come to him.  And most often in this case you will lose. <br><br>  <i>Gambling</i> <br><img src="http://blogs.parallels.com/.a/6a00e5503060a388330105370d7010970b-800wi" alt="image"><br><br>  The next generally accepted type of leisure in Vegas is going to clubs and shows - after all, Las Vegas is a show city.  Here, the most famous world artists rush to perform.  We used to go to the DJ-set Paul Oakenfold, <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3DVgS-4stj8fQ%26feature%3Drelated">Blue Man show</a> .  Another feature of the idle city: limousines there are a kind of taxi.  Limo riding is not an event.  It‚Äôs just the ability to move from one establishment to another in a large composition.  Standard nightclubs are compared only with the most fashionable Moscow institutions.  Well, and even non-standard ... What was the cost of the Minus 5 bar, where all the pieces of furniture, the bar counter and even glasses were made of ice ... <br><br>  <i>With the heroes of the show</i> <br><img src="http://blogs.parallels.com/.a/6a00e5503060a388330105370d706d970b-800wi" alt="image"><br><br>  If we talk about recreational events organized specially by Parallels, then a golf tournament took place on Monday, February 2, in which about 70 guests took part.  The most exemplary and punctual among the participants of the golf tournament were, oddly enough, journalists - apparently because they had arrived in Las Vegas just the day before, and the destructive influence of alcohol had not touched them by Monday morning.  The same evening, in the eye candy bar at the Mandalay Bay Hotel, where the Summit itself took place, a high-tech lounge party was held: they played all sorts of card games, sipping breathtaking cocktails.  Especially for this event, Parallels Punch was made, an extremely simple, but at the same time murderous vodka-based cocktail, which, by the way, was very imbued with all foreign guests.  There was also a noisy party dedicated to the release of Parallels Plesk Panel 9.0.  It‚Äôs not a secret for anyone, I hope, that all such events are, in one way or another, held for closer rapprochement with customers - ours was no exception - sales managers with customers wandered safely from one feast to another.  In four years of organizing the summit, foreigners have already learned how to keep up with us. <br><br>  Summarizing the above, in Vegas, you can find time for anything, but just do not try to set it apart for sleep, you are still waiting for defeat ... <br><br>  The next time the Parallels Summit is scheduled to be held in Miami at the end of February 2010.  I'm already in anticipation :). </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/51642/">https://habr.com/ru/post/51642/</a></p>
