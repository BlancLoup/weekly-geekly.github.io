    <a name="habracut"></a><h4>  Prehistory </h4><br>  In 1999, Aliph was founded - its goal was to develop noise reduction technology for the US Army.  In 2002, Aliph won a contract with DARPA to develop a method of communication for soldiers in difficult combat conditions.  Realizing the potential development opportunities, the company decided to release a consumer headset. <br><br>  Jawbone began working on wearable electronics before it became mainstream, and during its existence, she registered about 230 patents.  Developments include bracelets UP and UP24, portable wireless speakers Jambox and Big Jambox, bluetooth headsets Era and Icon, and NoiseAssassin technology. <br><br>  <i>Big jambox</i> <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/476/058/7ed/4760587edcf285757978de2dc74aac77.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  In 2012, the Jawbone UP bracelet entered the market.  Those who considered him just another gadget to control the smartphone were wrong.  The gadget was designed to help people be healthier: move more often, wake up at the right time, eat right, be more active.  To work, you need to install the UP application on the smartphone, and synchronization occurs through a 3.5 mm headphone jack hidden under the bracelet cap. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/GiC8QR_oHhk%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700023,15700186,15700191,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhhVcz8SfA9jNicCD0E8s2XMitBddA" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  In November 2013, Jawbone did some sort of bug fixing by releasing UP24.  The most useful innovation was the wireless synchronization using bluetooth.  To work you need the same UP application, which works both independently and in conjunction with third-party applications for your smartphone. <br><br><h4>  Equipment </h4><br>  Packaging is much smaller than the Basis.  The plastic cover protects the cardboard backing, on which the bracelet itself, the adapter for charging via USB and instructions are firmly fixed. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/7a6/08f/98e/7a608f98eb4f9c3c7b96ac1edc8749ba.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/23a/9d9/800/23a9d9800958689848a55c3f8db067e0.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  The miniature instruction book tells only that you need to download the application, and some general information.  You can read at your leisure. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/407/b7c/930/407b7c930b041a657048398e602563a1.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Adapter from 2.5 to USB.  Unlike the previous version of Jawbone UP, you will not be able to connect to the phone through the headphone jack.  Now everything is just without wires. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/c3e/1d8/419/c3e1d841998c79de3501984f08ab60f4.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  The bracelet is secured firmly, it will not dangle during transportation, which reduces the risk of buying it in advance broken during transportation. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/172/c5b/21b/172c5b21b48ec9962741002da3f218c6.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><h4>  Requirements </h4><br>  Your smartphone should be new - in the case of Android, you need an OS that has been updated to version 4.3.  I had some difficulties with this, since HTC has not yet updated the firmware for my One X. I had to take another smartphone. <br><br>  <b>IOS and Android devices support wireless syncing:</b> <br>  iPhone 4s and newer <br>  iPod Touch 5th generation and newer <br>  iPad 3rd generation and newer <br>  iPad mini <br>  Android 4.3 <br><br>  Synchronization is performed using Bluetooth Smart technology. <br><br><h4>  Design </h4><br>  One of the advantages of the Jawbone UP24 bracelet is that it looks great.  Moreover, it is not at all like any smart watch or other gadget - rather, an ornament that will look like with a classic suit, with a leather jacket, and with compression sportswear.  Even the button on one of the faces of the bracelet is hard to find the first time if you don‚Äôt know about its existence. <br><br>  The bracelet comes in three sizes and four colors - red, yellow, black, orange.  Figure has changed from the previous model. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/1f1/864/c60/1f1864c60ef3fe71b7d7ddc7d3b16c8f.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  <b>Dimensions:</b> <br>  S (140--155 mm) <br>  M (155-180 mm) <br>  L (180-200 mm) <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/aa3/a31/03b/aa3a3103b87e0f5d6b4726c87ed9797f.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  <b>Colors:</b> <br>  The black <br>  Orange <br>  Yellow <br>  Red <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/c25/eb3/704/c25eb37041413ba16605b0382eafee8a.png" alt="image"><br><br>  As I said, it looks great in the hall.  Maybe orange is not as brutal as black, but nonetheless. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/10f/d30/a13/10fd30a137debe3e99938b9590183789.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  LEDs indicate the active mode of operation. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/0f0/003/d2b/0f0003d2b7f00594ed041bb87188a4ec.gif" alt="image"><br><br>  Under the cap is hidden 2.5 mm jack. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/166/5a0/216/1665a0216b6df5ede9cf02357c13278c.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><h4>  Android app </h4><br>  The bracelet itself without an application makes no sense.  It is through the application that you control the bracelet - it calculates calories, records data about food and workouts, and sets alarms.  First you need to register and add information about yourself - gender, age, weight. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/d91/c19/45f/d91c1945fb4f9565300fd09ce78ad072.gif" alt="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/562/faf/e6d/562fafe6df2b61cd932a65d6f7678775.gif" alt="image"><br><br>  Further, the application briefly explains how the bracelet works.  To switch between sleep wakefulness modes, you need to press a button, after which the bracelet will alert you with a flashing symbol and vibration. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/0f0/003/d2b/0f0003d2b7f00594ed041bb87188a4ec.gif" alt="image"><br><br>  Activity means not only the steps you took during the day, but also other types of activity that you manually entered.  There are several of them - walking and running, strength training, cardio, exercise bike and others. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/1f2/2d9/ce6/1f22d9ce62ca182aa2625f629ecff323.gif" alt="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/203/abb/62b/203abb62b20ccf51bf42254256f0e555.gif" alt="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/593/a52/eef/593a52eef97f372196cd89f1a59f352f.gif" alt="image"><br><br>  The UP app keeps track of your life from all sides, including your diet.  What is extremely important for health.  But if everyone has enough willpower and discipline to clog up what they eat in the application every time? <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/168/0b1/9ad/1680b19ad6707104aeeafd0531124b0c.gif" alt="image"><br><br>  Has your mood changed?  Add changes to applications. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/dcf/2f5/88d/dcf2f588d7b34d768889caa13bd6ec1c.gif" alt="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/55b/fc0/59a/55bfc059a77440ace70bbe2eb5cf45a1.gif" alt="image"><br><br>  The gadget is not just watching you, but also makes you move.  After the amount of time you specified, there is no activity ‚Äî for example, if you sit in an armchair for half an hour ‚Äî the bracelet will alert you with a vibration.  Stand up, walk a bit, and you will be happy. <br><br><h4>  Sleep tracking and smart alarm clock </h4><br>  The function of a healthy daytime sleep really helps to sleep well - even if you try to do it discreetly in the office, right at the workplace.  While tracking the phases, the bracelet begins to vibrate about half an hour after you fall asleep, but when you are in the ‚Äúlight sleep‚Äù phase, it is at this time that the ascent is the easiest. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/4d0/fbf/705/4d0fbf7057796396ba1da44210367a49.gif" alt="image"><br><br>  I checked this function on myself - indeed, I woke up awake.  But, having understood that the function works as it should, I calmed down and fell asleep again without setting the alarm again.  I woke up broken.  So do not fall asleep again! <br><br>  The application also allows you to view the trends of sleep and activity by day, week and month. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/ea5/54b/0db/ea554b0db87c8749fea313699969d0fc.gif" alt="image"><br><br>  Well, the most important thing is the alarm clock, which will raise you in the morning in a slept state.  It is this unique function that can be decisive when choosing a fitness tracker, and it is this that forces people who are far from sports to choose this gadget.  So if you want to get enough sleep, and you have less time for it than you need - use the alarm clock, and you will wake up awake and in a good mood.  It worked for me. <br><br>  The main thing - do not forget to switch modes: got up in the morning - turned on wakefulness, go to bed - turn on sleep mode.  Then in the morning the alarm clock will wake you up - 10-20 minutes earlier than the specified time, but at the very moment when it will be necessary to make you feel as good as possible. <br><br><h4>  Interaction with third-party applications </h4><br>  An important factor in the convenience of a UP application is its ability to interact with third-party applications.  In this case, more lucky owners of gadgets on iOS - for them the list of applications is much more than for Android users.  But for me something was found: this is MyFitnessPal, a free application for gaining weight, losing weight and just for tracking your diet.  I chose it because it was the most convenient for entering data about breakfasts, dinners and snacks. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/9f7/862/41c/9f786241cc045087c94738a81801269e.gif" alt="image"><br><br>  When registering in MyFitnessPal, we again enter various data necessary for counting the burned and eaten calories. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/58d/230/01d/58d23001d7bf7f83b07575b3425006ad.gif" alt="image"><br><br>  To enter the product, you can use the barcode reader.  In the database of products very much.  Only the cake ‚ÄúFrom Palych‚Äù did not make its way, and the milk was displayed as ‚ÄúCoffee with milk‚Äù.  All kinds of cheese and trout "Santa Bremor" were found immediately. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/d80/346/08e/d8034608eb7a16a82b48047fc7e90490.gif" alt="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/392/d40/d77/392d40d778abfb6babe27797626f10b1.gif" alt="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/e03/f7b/da3/e03f7bda3d35a884e1117b6647e8e35e.gif" alt="image"><br><br>  Myfitnesspal displays calories eaten, and also displays data on calories burned from the UP.  At the same time, the amount of food eaten is displayed in UP. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/80d/913/ae6/80d913ae68e78fefe2d20936d6ad180d.gif" alt="image"><br><br><h4>  Battery </h4><br>  The device will have to be charged about once a week using the included adapter - from 2.5 jack to USB. <br><br><h4>  Verdict </h4><br>  The design of the device is made in such a way that the bracelet does not look like a gadget at all, but rather an ornament, which I definitely attribute to pluses. <br><br>  The <a href="http://madrobots.ru/catalog/zdorove_2_0/jawbone-up24/">Jawbone UP24 bracelet</a> is a real helper in caring for your loved one.  And if you give it to someone, in caring for someone else you love.  It lacks only two things: a heart rate monitor and a tonometer, and if the latter is not yet present in any portable gadget at all ( <a href="http://madrobots.ru/catalog/zdorove_2_0/withings-blood-pressure-monitor-tonometr-s-podderzhkoy-ios/">tonometers for iOS are</a> not counted), then the heart rate monitor would be very useful. <br><br>  When choosing between a bracelet with a heart rate monitor and a smart alarm clock, it makes sense to stop on the alarm clock, if you do not have heart problems, as well as the need to constantly monitor the pulse. <br><br>  <i>Subscribe to <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/madrobots/">Madrobots' blog</a> and play sports!</i> <br>  According to the HABR code, blog readers can always count on a 5% discount. <br><br>  It is interesting: <br>  <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/madrobots/blog/218375/">Basis: B1</a> <br>  <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/212483/">The history of smart watches</a> <br>  <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/212811/">History of heart rate monitors</a> <br>  <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/216321/">To health!</a>  <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/216321/">Ten most interesting new products of 2014</a> <br>  <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/212633/">To health!</a>  <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/212633/">Wearable devices in sports and medicine</a> <br>  <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/212723/">Expanding opportunities</a> <br><br> <a href="https://twitter.com/MadrobotsRu"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/ac1/fc6/d2a/ac1fc6d2a19948c59791b0da6ab659df.gif"></a> <a href="http://vk.com/madrobots"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/933/ac3/0b6/933ac30b6fd24ffd82218148c2fb0917.gif"></a> <a href="http://instagram.com/madrobotsru"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/464/a82/e04/464a82e045a34bae81406fd0b640cf08.gif"></a> <a href="http://facebook.com/madrobotsrussia"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/0b5/542/136/0b55421365064901acdf0ed58cc4a111.gif"></a> <br> <a href="http://madrobots.ru/"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/63d/405/78e/63d40578ecbf48f28c62f57705c73eb6.gif"></a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/221051/">https://habr.com/ru/post/221051/</a></p>
