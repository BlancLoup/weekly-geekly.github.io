We have not received news from us for a long time, but this is not surprising.  Having more or less adjusted the work of Photoawards.ru, we moved on to more serious things.  The idea of ‚Äã‚Äãthis project was on the surface, but matured for a long time.  As a result, our team turned out to be the fastest - who was the first to have the idea belongs to that.  If competitors planned something (and enemy intelligence reports from all sides, yes, they planned it, but somewhere through goooooddd, and maybe through dvaaaaaa ....), now their plans are finished.  As the Prophotos team launched this week the <a href="http://bestphotographer.ru/%3Futm_source%3Dhabr">First Open National Photo Awards "Best Photographer - 2009"</a> (then it will become ... -2010, ... -2011, etc.), opening the site <a href="http://bestphotographer.ru/%3Futm_source%3Dhabr">BestPhotographer.ru</a> . <br><br><a name="habracut"></a>  As you remember, in general <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/startup/45383/">we already had a portal about contests</a> .  So why another one, you ask?  We answer.  The first competitive site, <a href="http://photoawards.ru/%3Futm_source%3Dhabr">Photoawards</a> , was like the first stage of preparation for the project.  We got acquainted with our audience even closer - if users only read <a href="http://prophotos.ru/%3Futm_source%3Dhabr">Prophotos.ru magazine</a> , now they have shown on <a href="http://photoawards.ru/%3Futm_source%3Dhabr">Photoawards.ru</a> that they are shooting themselves.  We recognized their hopes, their aspirations.  During the work with this project, we met many good photographers who, having downloaded literally a few photos, acquired the highest - platinum - status.  But then they are masters - each photo turned out to be a prize in its competition.  It was these users that we were the first to invite to participate in the Award. <br><br> <a href="http://bestphotographer.ru/%3Futm_source%3Dhabr"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/fd7/16c/5c7/fd716c5c7c911301e66dea4fea739d18.jpg" align="right"></a>  Unlike the Photoawards.ru contests, the First Opened National Photographic Awards "Best Photographer", although it has a website on the Internet, is primarily an offline project.  Works are submitted via the Network, but their further life - exhibitions, books and, of course, the award ceremony takes place offline.  In the same place, offline, master classes of the award participants are held.  Unlike our past projects, here the site is just an auxiliary tool.

      During the preparation for the project, we managed to communicate with a bunch of various very important people from the world of photography, who were called to the jury.  In general, the work with the Prize is interesting - the Prize will be developed together with us, and we along with it.  Already at the stage of our acquaintance, our distinguished jury prompted us a few good chips, pointed out a couple of mistakes, praised for some ideas and findings. <br><br>  Generally, if we talk essentially, perhaps, <a href="http://bestphotographer.ru/%3Futm_source%3Dhabr">BestPhotographer.ru</a> is the most long-lasting project of our team in its development.  Photo Contest - launched and see which photos came in, the most difficult thing in the online photojournal is to fill it with some content so that the pages do not look empty.  Here we will get at least some result in at least a year.  Until January, participants will send photos, then we will begin work with the jury, then there will be an exhibition and rewarding, and only then we will be able to look around and take a look at what we have done to this.  The final result will be clear only in a few years.  But, we are sure, this result will be worth the effort spent on it now. <br><br>  We can talk about this project for a long time - there are many pitfalls, interesting discoveries, and finds.  Our Argentum statuette deserves special attention (something like an Oscar in a photo - you can read about it on the website).  But, sometimes it's better to stop in time.  That is, summing up, you can congratulate the team Prophotos with another startup.  <a href="http://bestphotographer.ru/%3Futm_source%3Dhabr">BestPhotographer.ru</a> will not be the easiest project, but we are no less successful than the previous ones. <habracut></habracut></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/62384/">https://habr.com/ru/post/62384/</a></p>
