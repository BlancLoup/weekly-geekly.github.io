  <section class="page js-page"><h1>We draw acrylic on fabric</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Then the people asked about the features of acrylic paint, and where to buy it.  I thought that it would not hurt then to tell more about the technology of its application to the fabric, and decided to put the story in a separate topic. <br><br>  Acrylic paints are water-based paints that consist of three key components - water, dye and acrylic emulsion.  This type of paint is characterized by the brightness of colors, and most importantly (when applying a pattern on clothes, this is important first of all) - resistance to aggressive conditions.  That is, having properly made a pattern on the fabric, you can barely worry about it.  It will not peel off, will not crumble, will not wrinkle, and will generally remain as good as new for a long time, because acrylic is well tolerated by temperature drops, mechanical stress, and poorly susceptible to moisture. <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  Fixing the paint on the fabric and the acquisition of the above properties is as follows: after contact with air, the aqueous base gradually begins to evaporate, leaving only the pigment and the elastic acrylic polymer that holds it on the surface.  Naturally, the thinner the layer of applied paint, the faster it dries, so it will be quicker and more qualitative to make several ‚Äúeasy‚Äù passes in one area than to apply one thick layer and to languish for long hours while waiting.

      Now directly about the technique of application and the required minimum.  Since the T-shirt theme has been raised in the last few days, we‚Äôll continue it.  First you need to choose a plain T-shirt, which will be applied to the drawing, and then decide on the type of paint: if you are going to apply the image through a stencil, it is more convenient to use spray cans, because with their help a more uniform layer will come out.  And if someone intends to paint directly on the fabric, it is better to pay attention to brushes of different sizes, acrylic paints in tubes or cans, as well as a thinner that cannot be dispensed with, as thick paint cannot provide sufficiently thin and smooth lines. <br><br>  After you have decided on the design and its technique, find a well-ventilated room (this is true mainly if aerosols are used), so God forbid you do not breathe, and clear yourself a flat surface on which to place a well-straightened T-shirt.  By the way, it is best to put some unnecessary piece of cloth or a large sheet of paper inside it so that the paint does not get on the opposite side.  Further, if you intend to cut a stencil, I advise you to attend to the purchase of adhesive paper.  With it, the risk that the stencil will move out of the intended place is minimal, and the borders of the pattern will be clearer.  And if you begin to draw by hand, then here I can only share theoretical knowledge, since I myself paint with living colors without the possibility of pressing Ctrl + Z very mediocre.  So, before applying the first layer, it would not be superfluous to draw the outlines of the future "canvas" on the fabric with a pencil.  And, of course, it is worth washing the brushes more often, until the villi do not have time to shrivel in one solid lump. <br><br>  Well, after the drawing is completely dry (a thin layer usually seizes about the same time as the acrvarel), it needs to be fixed with an iron (it's difficult for me to tell from the temperature ... you need not too hot, but not just warm :), putting between the design and the sole sheet of thick paper or fabric, so as not to accidentally spoil their labors. <br><br>  Here, in general, and all that I know about it, I hope someone will help;).  And about ‚Äúwhere to buy‚Äù, I would advise the Muscovites ‚ÄúPeredvizhnik‚Äù shop (peredvignik.ru), where they seem to be competent enough consultants who will always answer the question.  Alas, I can‚Äôt help the others, because I simply don‚Äôt know. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/57042/">https://habr.com/ru/post/57042/</a></p>
