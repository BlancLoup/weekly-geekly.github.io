      According to analytical company Analytics Analytics, in 2016 almost 90% of cars produced in North America and Europe will support wireless connections to one degree or another.  ‚ÄúThe widespread penetration of Bluetooth, 3G, GPS, as well as the spread of smartphones, is increasing the requirements for on-board automotive communications,‚Äù said Jo Blight, director of global global automotive market research at Strategy Analytics.  - According to our data, e-mail, maps, navigation, music and radio are priorities for consumers.  Management systems for these applications and software will be a new field of competition for automakers, and they will either win or lose in this fight. ‚Äù <br><br>  Ford needed a full-fledged browser to access the Internet, integrated into the on-board system and suitable for installation in various Ford cars.  Today, the requirements for business mobility and the ability of employees and specialists to work in the field are growing rapidly.  This leads to the need to provide complete and secure access to office databases, corporate email, news feeds, information about traffic jams and weather using embedded on-board computer systems. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  ‚ÄúWith Opera technologies, car manufacturers can offer their customers a simple and familiar work screen on the Web, which can also be configured for voice control,‚Äù said Christen Krogh, director of product development at Opera.  - In our opinion, Internet access technologies in car computers are becoming easier for users and at the same time have extensive customization capabilities.  Opera, the leader of innovation on the Web, offers a flexible and multi-platform solution for car manufacturers. ‚Äù <br><br>  Basic data of the ‚ÄúWeb on Wheels‚Äù report: <br>  - Web technologies simplify access to the functions of the car, as well as allow you to implement new unique features. <br>  - Automotive technologies of access to the Web make mobile and private users and, more importantly, private entrepreneurs, representatives of small and large businesses.  A car computer can provide the driver and passengers with safe access to work information stored on office computers and servers. <br>  ‚ÄúIn the automotive industry, miscalculations and mistakes rarely go unnoticed, and the‚Äú seamless ‚Äùintegration of technology in the car is a major competitive advantage. <br>  - Using conventional computers and laptops while driving without special technical equipment is unsafe for the driver.  The experience of using web technologies shows that the driver should have as comfortable and convenient access to the Web as he has at home or in the office, but on the way he does not need all the functions of working on the Internet that he uses outside the car. <br>  - The concept of Internet-connected cars gives automakers another opportunity to compete successfully for a demanding customer. <br>  - Opera browsers allow you to adapt web technologies for automotive control systems and customize them in accordance with customer preferences, to offer interactive applications based on open web standards. <br><br>  The Ford Motor Company at the Consumer Electronic Show in January 2010 received the CES Innovation Award in the category ‚Äúin-vehicle accessories‚Äù for its on-board computer system.
