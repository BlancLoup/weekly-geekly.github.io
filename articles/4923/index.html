I will speak now.  As you already know, on Tuesday Steve Jobs presented the iPhone to the public.  Not a phone, not a player, not a communicator, but an <a href="http://apple.com/iphone">iPhone</a> .  And it can‚Äôt be called a revolution. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Let's start with the fact that the shares of manufacturers of smartphones and communicators sharply crawled down after the start <a href="http://www.apple.com/quicktime/qtv/keynote/">of Jobs' performance</a> .  By the end, they (stocks) were entering a steep dive.  The losses of various companies ranged from 3 to 8% and it is not known whether they will be able to give an adequate response in the coming years.  Even without considering the properties of the new product, you can confidently say that Jobs‚Äôs planned level of 1% of the mobile phone market will be demolished already this year, and with the advent of subsequent iPhone models, Apple has every chance to stand in line with Nokia, Samsung and Motorola.  If not bypass them.  But this is from the realm of fantasy. <br><br>  However, science fiction - the new iPhone.  Skeptical citizens are already tearing their hair, stomping their feet and struggling to continue not to understand what is so revolutionary about this device.  Some Apple fans are upset with the color of the device (it is presented only in black so far), others are distressed with the delivery time - summer 2007 - to the USA, winter 2007 - Europe, 2008 - Asia.  All this is not the slightest value.  Because Apple‚Äôs capacity is not enough to satisfy the demand for iPhones.  What kind of animal is this and are we all waiting for it? <br><br>  The Apple iPhone, as already noted, is not a phone.  This is not an iPod or a smartphone, a communicator or a PDA.  This is all at once and a little more.  Specifications you can see on any hi-tech resource, I will focus on what is important to me and other future owners of the iPhone.

      <strong>Design</strong> .  It is known that Apple will never make any extra buttons on any of its devices.  Not a single extra bulb, not a single unnecessary indicator.  The iPhone has only one button.  Only one.  ONE.  But my N73 is 30, considering the joystick.  Due to the lack of unnecessary (as it turned out) the keyboard was able to make the device, consisting of a single screen.  The overwhelming majority of predictions regarding screen sizes have come true.  The screen, a diagonal of 3.5 inches (9 centimeters!), Displays all the colors, and, judging by the presentation, impeccably fast.  The form and general appearance of the device of the imagination is not amazing, but leaves a lasting feeling of harmony and style. <br><br>  <strong>Interface</strong> .  Of course, it‚Äôs rather ridiculous to approach the iPhone with standard phone benchmarks.  But I will try.  The interface is something for which it costs to throw out any of your phone and buy an iPhone.  Mentioned huge screen is fully touch.  And the touch screen is what?  This is a stylus.  And the stylus, in turn, is what?  It sucks.  So, in the furnace stylus.  Let the device be controlled with your fingers.  This is incomparably more convenient than poking at the screen with a toothpick, right?  :) At the same time, the management system has been perfected.  And a set of SMS, organized on a pop-up QWERTY keyboard with at least all fingers, and scaling photos with one completely intuitive finger movement, dragging, scrolling is so natural that it is even strange that no one has yet implemented it.  Beautiful icons, beautiful effects, working with the same speed as on any Mac, that is almost flawless.  But this is the next topic. <br><br>  <strong>Functionality</strong> .. Just don't laugh, but the iPhone is Mac nano or Mac micro, if you like.  It has a real MacOS X. with all the consequences.  Fast, reliable and delightfully beautiful.  Now - and on the phone.  That is, in a widescreen player.  Or rather - in the Internet communicator.  In general, in the iPhone.  The familiar and complete iPhoto, one of the best Safari browsers, brought to the absolute in this little gadget, almost flawless Mail.app and familiar to every iTunes.  This device will become the center of your iLife away from home.  And listen to music, watch movies, and climb on the Internet.  Moreover, you no longer need to compromise between convenience and mobility.  Your Mac is always with you, in your pocket.  Sell ‚Äã‚Äãyour iPod nano - it is no longer needed, in iPhone'e from 4 to 8 Gb of space.  Sell ‚Äã‚Äãyour phone - it is no longer needed, because it does not have half the functionality of the iPhone.  Sell ‚Äã‚Äãyour PDA - the iPhone has wifi, bluetooth and edge with gprs, and the phone will automatically switch between gprs and wifi depending on what is available at the moment.  A laptop?  Camera?  Leave, the iPhone is still not a complete replacement for a laptop.  Well, not a replacement for the camera at all.  As a result of this sale, buy an iPhone - at worst it will cost you $ 800 ($ 599 for a model with 8 GB + mark-up). <br><br>  Pipette tar.  Camera.  But, on the other hand, no one forces you to use it.  Lack of GPS.  It is stated that the iPhone knows where you are, but no mention of gps.  Probably, this function is realized through the positioning capabilities in GSM networks. <br><br>  Apple really made a revolution by introducing a device that has no analogues in nature.  And there is no doubt that this is the most awaited device of all that ever existed.  There is no doubt about the prospects of the iPhone either - it is quite a killer of a mobile phone in its current form. <br><br>  PS The absolute absence of information leaks deserves a separate mention.  After all, nothing reliably known until yesterday about the iPhone was not.  On the other hand - a few years of diligent heating of interest in the apparatus.  And the release of this very apparatus, when the interest turned into a fever ... What a literate people! </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/4923/">https://habr.com/ru/post/4923/</a></p>
