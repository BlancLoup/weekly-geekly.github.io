Opera Unite is able to make any computer not only a client device, but also a server.  This allows users to connect with computers of friends and acquaintances directly and share information without the use of online services and applications.

      With Opera Unite, sharing data between computers is as easy as working with web resources.  This technology allows the end user to better control the use of his private data in the public domain.  In addition, he can work remotely with information stored on his computer using any other device equipped with a modern web browser. <br><br>  Developers need to know that Opera Unite services are based on the same open web standards as web sites.  This greatly simplifies the creation of new applications based on Opera Unite - developing them is no more difficult than creating web pages. <br><br>  Opera Unite technology is available in a special version of the Opera 10 browser, which can be downloaded for free at <a href="http://labs.opera.com/">labs.opera.com</a> . <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  <b>Using Opera Unite</b> <br>  1. Download and open the browser assembly from Opera Unite from <a href="http://labs.opera.com/">labs.opera.com</a> <br>  2. Click on the Opera Unite logo in the lower left corner of the browser window and enter the username and password that you use to log into other Opera resources, such as My Opera and Opera Link.  If you do not have an account, Opera Unite will offer to create it. <br>  3. Opera Unite is accessed from the sidebar of the browser, and new services can be downloaded from the <a href="http://unite.opera.com/">unite.opera.com</a> section <a href="http://unite.opera.com/">.</a> <br>  4. Starting the service will create a direct link to the Opera Unite application, for example <a href="http://notebook.jondoe.operaunite.com/photo_sharing">notebook.jondoe.operaunite.com/photo_sharing</a> .  In this link: ‚Äúnotebook‚Äù is the name of the local device with the contents (files), ‚Äújondoe‚Äù is the name of the user, ‚Äúphoto_sharing‚Äù is the name of the Opera Unite service to which you open access from the outside.  By clicking on this link, friends and acquaintances will get access to the content that is open to them on the hard disk of your computer through a normal web browser. <br>  5. To see which of your friends are using Opera Unite services on your My Opera Unite home page. <br><br>  Opera Unite services work directly in the browser.  Currently, the following services are available to users for free: <br><br>  File Sharing: using this application, you can share other users with files on your computer.  In this case, you do not need to pre-upload these files to specialized online services.  Just select a folder on your local drive, access to which you want to provide.  Opera Unite will generate a direct link to this folder.  It can be sent to friends with whom you want to share files. <br>  <b>Web server (Web Server)</b> : this service allows you to run a full-fledged website from a computer.  Simply select the folder with the files of the website on the local disk and allow access to it from the outside.  All content will remain on your computer, which will act simultaneously as a repository of information.  Opera Unite automatically recognizes and launches index files, so your website will appear as it was designed. <br>  <b>Media Player</b> : access to your music wherever you are and from any computer.  To do this, select the folder with the music collection in MP3 format and allow access to it, and then use the direct link Opera Unite, opening it in any browser and starting to listen to the songs using the Opera Media Player. <br>  <b>Access to photo (Photo Sharing)</b> : now you can share photos with friends and relatives directly from your computer without sending files to online services.  To do this, simply select the folder with photos on the local disk of the computer, and the application will create a gallery of their thumbnails.  Full-size photo is loaded by clicking on the thumbnail. <br>  <b>Living Room (The Lounge)</b> : This service allows you to organize a chat with friends right on your computer.  Your friends can join the conversation by clicking on a direct link, without having to register with any online services.  Depending on the settings, you only need to tell them the password to enter the chat. <br>  <b>The Fridge</b> : Attach notes to your friends' virtual refrigerators.  Now you can exchange messages with them in safe mode and in real time.  Do not forget to tell them a direct link to your "fridge". <br><br>  Six services already available in Opera Unite, created to demonstrate the capabilities of the new technology.  Web developers can unleash their imagination and create applications themselves, fully exploiting the potential of Opera Unite. <br><br>  <b>Why did we release Opera Unite?</b> <br>  Every day more and more data and more and more services for their processing and storage appear on the Internet.  Cloud technologies allowed sharing information anytime, anywhere, with any user.  However, this freedom of access is associated with the transfer of private data to third parties - web application servers.  This significantly reduces the ability to control the use of personal files. <br><br>  We hope that the "cloud" computing will continue to change our understanding of web applications for the better.  But we also believe in another way to exchange private information - without losing control over it.  It is this idea that formed the basis of the Opera Unite technology, and it is in it that we see the future of the Web. <br><br>  ‚ÄúToday we are discovering the real potential of the Internet for all users,‚Äù said Jon von Tetzchner, chief executive officer of Opera.  - Technologies are developing in a spiral.  Once the emergence of personal computers led to the distribution of computing previously focused on mainframes.  In turn, Opera Unite is designed to make the "cloud" technology more democratic.  A browser with an embedded web server will give developers the ability to quickly and easily create web applications, and end users will receive a flexible tool with a powerful access control system for private data and advanced information sharing functionality.  We believe that Opera Unite is our most significant innovation ever, because this technology is changing the fundamental concepts of web space. " <br><br>  <b>From developer to developer</b> <br>  ‚ÄúThe possibilities of combining social services and modern technologies are exactly what interested me in Opera Unite,‚Äù said Molly E. Holzschlag, web evangelist for Opera.  - The use of open standards, such as HTML, CSS and JavaScript, allows you to create Opera Unite services not only for venerable web developers, but also amateurs.  Opera Unite gives people the opportunity to realize their ideas by creating technological and social applications on the basis of nowadays and publicly available open standards. ‚Äù <br><br>  <b>Additional Information</b> <br>  Introduction to Opera Unite: <a href="http://dev.opera.com/articles/view/an-introduction-to-opera-unite">dev.opera.com/articles/view/an-introduction-to-opera-unite</a> <br>  Opera Unite - the alphabet for developers: <a href="http://dev.opera.com/articles/view/opera-unite-developer-primer">dev.opera.com/articles/view/opera-unite-developer-primer</a> <br>  Yusef - Opera Unite service structure: <a href="http://dev.opera.com/articles/view/yusef-the-opera-unite-service-framework">dev.opera.com/articles/view/yusef-the-opera-unite-service-framework</a> <br>  Markuper - Opera Unite Templates Library: <a href="http://dev.opera.com/articles/view/markuper-unite-template-library">dev.opera.com/articles/view/markuper-unite-template-library</a> <br>  Download the Opera Unite applications you have developed: <a href="http://unite.opera.com/">unite.opera.com</a> <br>  Video - start using Opera Unite: <a href="http://unite.opera.com/support">unite.opera.com/support</a> <br>  Screenshots of Opera Unite <a href="http://www.opera.com/press/resources">www.opera.com/press/resources</a> <br><br>  <b>About Opera Software ASA</b> <br>  Opera Software ASA is an industry leader in the development of web browsers for desktops, mobile phones and other devices.
