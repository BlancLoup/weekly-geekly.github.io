Developments can be sent until May 31, 2016. <br><br>  The requirements for such a viewer or viewer are rather vague and require not only knowledge of the structure of CDA, but also typical problems encountered by doctors when working with them (CSS-based conversion is built into CDA by default). <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/ef1/ac4/f7b/ef1ac4f7bca9b872eca5e0a073ccfde3.jpg" alt="image">

According to the CDA standard, the document should have the following characteristics: Persistence, Stewardship, Potential for authentication, Context, Wholeness and Human readability.  The contest is aimed at improving the latest characteristics, namely, the readability of the CDA document for a doctor or patient.  The process by which XML documents are converted to human readable in HL7 is called, expected, rendering.  So, one of the requirements for C-CDA is that all the clinically important components of the C-CDA document must be present (i.e. must be translatable) into human readable form. <br><br>  Currently, many practitioners are frustrated with the usability of C-CDA documents due to an oversupply of data provided by EHR systems, making it very difficult to sort data by relevance, find relationships between different sections of a document and determine the only event for which C- CDA document was created.  Providers of EHR systems, for a variety of reasons, usually convert much more information into a human-readable format than medical practitioners need.  In some especially neglected cases, the entire patient's history is placed in the CDA.  A viewer that can simplify viewing only relevant information will save a lot of time and at the same time ensures that clinicians will not miss the information needed to make a decision. <br><br>  <b>The essence of the competition</b> <br><br>  Participants in the C-CDA Rendering Tool Challenge should develop a viewer to help doctors convert the C-CDA document and provide information meaningful only to that doctor.  Accordingly, the viewer should convert and display only the data that the doctor deemed relevant, as a result of which the doctor will be able to quickly and efficiently assess the patient's condition.  The viewer should be easy to use, provide the requested data in a short period of time, whether it is sorted, filtered, or in some other way requested sections of the document. <br><br>  Developers of this type of viewer can implement additional functions, for example, provide not only the data requested by the doctor, but also provide a way to provide data that is repeated in different sections. <br><br>  <b>Requirements</b> <br><br>  Participants must adhere to existing principles and requirements for the conversion of CDA documents (according to the standard): <br>  ‚Ä¢ a strictly defined method for converting an arbitrary C-CDA document. <br>  ‚Ä¢ If a title is defined for a C-CDA document, it must be converted. <br>  ‚Ä¢ If the C-CDA Body is structured, the section labels defined in Section.title must be converted.  Absence Section.title means no section of the document. <br>  ‚Ä¢ if structured content is taken from narrative, the transformation mechanism should be described. <br>  ‚Ä¢ if the content is taken from structured content, there must be a mechanism to determine the process by which the narrative was created from the structured data. <br><br>  Additional requirements: <br>  ‚Ä¢ development should be open source; <br>  ‚Ä¢ development must meet the minimum certification requirements for C-CDA document viewers according to the 2015 Certification Criteria: <br>  Show data only in a specific section, <br>  ‚ó¶ ability to sort sections, <br>  ‚ó¶ ability to specify the number of sections to view. <br>  ‚Ä¢ Winner development will be available on Github and can be freely used on the HL7 website. <br>  ‚Ä¢ The winners will receive free registration and the opportunity to participate in the 30th annual HL7 plenary meeting (September 18-23, 2016 in Baltimore, Maryland), where they will be able to demonstrate their designs. <br><br>  Original requirements, as well as contacts for all questions about the competition - <a href="http://www.hl7.org/events/toolingchallenge.cfm">www.hl7.org/events/toolingchallenge.cfm#rules</a> <br><br>  <i>Update 1</i> : HL7 organizes a webinar <b>February 4 / 1:00 - 2:00 PM ET</b> to discuss the issues raised.  Register for the webinar on the contest page. <br><br>  <i>Update 2</i> : And so, the contest is over and the winner is revealed.  The winner was Bryn Lewis, PhD, Principal <br>  Software Development Consultant at Intelsoft (Melbourne, Australia).  Below, without any translation, a description and links to the <b>C-CDA Viewer Tool</b> from the winner. <br><br>  The C-CDA Viewer is an easy-to-use view of the complex C-CDA documents, available directly in any web browser.  The design of responsive screen space.  Users can hide, collapse and move CDA document. <br><br>  Additionally: <br>  ‚Ä¢ Document sections can be manipulated via the document Table of Contents; <br>  ‚Ä¢ Subsequent CDA documents opened; <br>  ‚Ä¢ Ability to detect and hide / show duplicates; <br>  ‚Ä¢ The result is an intuitive and user-friendly document layout; <br>  ‚Ä¢ It can be used on a PC tablet or mobile device.  It will also run as a standalone local fileset. <br><br>  Watch a demo version of the tool: <a href="http://intelsoft.com.au/challenge/index.htm">intelsoft.com.au/challenge/index.htm</a> <br>  Learn more about the tool: <a href="https://github.com/brynlewis/C-CDA_Viewer">github.com/brynlewis/C-CDA_Viewer</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/274977/">https://habr.com/ru/post/274977/</a></p>
