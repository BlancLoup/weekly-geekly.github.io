The phone itself is very good and it suits me all, but I wanted more, SMARTPHONE!  I looked at HTC Tattoo and HTC Hero for a very long time, but HTC‚Äôs feeding with promises for fresh firmware didn‚Äôt get much, and besides, these phones didn‚Äôt seem perfect to me in some respects, so I couldn‚Äôt decide on a purchase.  And then I accidentally found out that, apart from any NOKLA and NCKIA, the Chinese had quite good and cheap Windows Mobile smartphones.  Then I sat down to study the assortment of Chinese stores and study reviews about them bit by bit, and it turned out that not everything is so bad, the phones work, and it seems sometimes quite good.

      <i>As I understand it, the main reason why the Chinese have got a lot of smartphones is Huawei, which released the K3 mobile platform, which includes all the components for the phone (processor, camera, bluetooth, wifi, and everything else).</i>  <i>Those.</i>  <i>There is a ready-made platform, you just need to assemble the phone and finish the firmware.</i>  <i>At the same time, as I understand, while all the drivers and applications are only for Windows Mobile, so a few representatives of Chinese androids go on other processors, while the level of deception in the characteristics goes off scale.</i>  <i>So, if a version of the android is made under K3, then the Chinese will have a lot more of interesting things from the phones.</i> <br><br>  <i>At the same time, it is not necessary to compare these phones and others, which are dvuhsimochnye, three-TV on the platform MTK.</i>  <i>Those.</i>  <i>different platforms, different phones, different price levels, different possibilities.</i>  <i>However, smartphones also started to go on the MTK.</i>  <i>Again, waiting for the consequences.</i> <br><br>  After a couple of weeks of agony of choice between a bunch of different phones, among which was the <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/phones/93853/">Sunno A880</a> and Sunno S880 Pro already reviewed and some others, I stopped at the <a href="http://fastcardtech.com/goods-4336.html">HTC Eris G5</a> , because  I liked him most of all the others with his appearance (although he didn‚Äôt cause delight in most of my friends, so as I understood it was a matter of taste).  Actually, a nice appearance, it is a merit of HTC, namely <a href="http://www.htc.com/us/products/droid-eris-verizon">HTC DROID Eris</a> (a simplified version of Nexus One for Verizon).  The Chinese brazenly copied the look, though they forgot to put Android there, and inserted Windows Mobile 6.5.x (but did not forget to add HTC and Android pictures that appear when the device is turned on or off). <br><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h4>  Appearance and equipment </h4><br>  <i>Unfortunately, when I received the phone, the camera was on vacation, and I couldn‚Äôt take a picture of the box and accessories, but now the box has already been removed, so I‚Äôll insert the photos later.</i> <i><br></i>  <i>I also apologize for the imperfect appearance of the phone, did not find any napkins to wipe.</i>  <i>On the other hand, the phone is Chinese, and the photos must be appropriate :)</i> <i><br></i> <br><br><h5>  Equipment </h5><br>  So, the phone came in in a very nice small box with HTC logos and pictures, the box was not even particularly crumpled, although it was packaged in just one package with pimples (delivery went via EMS). <br><br>  Inside was: <br><ul><li>  the phone itself </li><li>  nice velvet case with HTC logo </li><li>  two 1300mAh batteries </li><li>  folding stylus on a string is completely out of topic </li><li>  light charge with American plug and USB input </li><li>  adapter to our standard sockets </li><li>  miniUSB-USB cable (miniUSB is some kind of 10-pin, but it changes without problems to an ordinary one) </li><li>  very mediocre headset with microphone and button </li><li>  mini-DVD disc with English instructions and a bunch of software for the phone </li><li>  instruction in chinese </li></ul><br><br>  Almost all of this was put back in the box (charged from the computer), so at the moment there is only a phone and a case in which I wear it <br> <a href=""><img src="http://habreffect.ru/files/24e/0e4894aa6/im8th.jpg"></a> <br><br><h5>  Appearance </h5><br>  At first, I already wrote about the fact that the phone is very nice, black plastic plastic "soft".  Assembled well enough, though if you squeeze, you can hear squeaks, because under the battery is removed the entire back cover, which is mounted on the latches, and it just squeaks.  Also, because of this, there are small gaps in places (you can see them in photos, although in reality they are smaller and do not strain).  Also, the power and volume buttons are also on the cover, so without it, turning on / off the phone is problematic. <br><br>  The Chinese claim that the size of the phone is 110x55x14mm, the ruler confirms this in principle.  It is comfortable to hold the phone in your hand, it does not slip, all the buttons are at hand. <br><br> <a href=""><img src="http://habreffect.ru/files/161/219533f1f/im9th.jpg"></a> <br><br> <a href=""><img src="http://habreffect.ru/files/d6a/b93e32b5b/im2th.jpg"></a> <br>  The front is a bright enough and juicy screen (just do not have to look at it gradients, Windows Mobile does not like them, only 65536 colors).  In the sun, almost nothing is visible, but you can set the backlight to a maximum, it will be better. <br>  At the top left of the window for color diodes showing the status of the phone.  For example, flashing blue is bluetooth, red is GPS, green is WiFi, burning red is charging, and purple is calibrating mode. <br><br>  under the screen there are 4 touch buttons, 3 of which can be reassigned: Home, back, launch the player and the camera.  In the dark glow white. <br>  Two hard buttons to send and end a call, between which there is a trackball with a button (unlike Sunno A880, this is exactly a spinning trackball). <br><br> <a href=""><img src="http://habreffect.ru/files/6f0/79b834863/im3th.jpg"></a> <br>  On the left, two volume buttons, on the right there is nothing. <br><br> <a href=""><img src="http://habreffect.ru/files/d2c/fe68695c2/im4th.jpg"></a> <br>  From the bottom there is a charging jack, as I already wrote, some tricky miniUSB with 10 pins, but now I use a normal cable, the phone works with it without problems. <br><br> <a href=""><img src="http://habreffect.ru/files/480/a8f10a507/im5th.jpg"></a> <br>  On the top there is a power button and a 3.5mm headset jack.  Perhaps this is the only ergonomic miscalculation, since it is inconvenient to use the button when the headset is inserted. <br>  It‚Äôs necessary to say about the connector separately, the fact is that I stuck different ears into it, and only with some there were problems in that the left ear did not work, if you press and hold, then everything works.  However, only with some that worked in other devices without problems.  So keep that in mind.  I do not know if this is a marriage of a specific copy of the phone, or in all such connectors, but there is a small problem. <br><br> <a href=""><img src="http://habreffect.ru/files/ccb/922a9e0fc/im6th.jpg"></a> <br>  Behind there is a glamorous inscription Windows Mobile and a camera.  There is no flash.  About the camera below, but I can say that the pictures are very, very terrible.  There is also a hole for the speaker of a very original shape of the ‚Äúhole‚Äù type. <br><br><h4>  What is and how it works </h4><br><br><h5>  Phone </h5><br>  4 ranges.  It works, there were no special glitches.  True, the signal level seems to be lower, but it is somehow strangely displayed, in the same place it can be from one division to full scale.  What is the reason, I did not find out, but I did not observe problems with SMS and calls.  The quality of the speaker, though not a fountain, the sound is not very clear, but because  I mostly use the headset, for me it is not particularly important.  She's fine. <br><br><h5>  GPRS / EDGE </h5><br>  It works, nothing to add.  Icons show what is now seeing (G / E) <br><br><h5>  Bluetooth </h5><br>  Problems also not noticed.  Quickly made friends with the headset and gives it a good sound.  I also made friends with an external GPS receiver, created a virtual COM port and automatically hooks it up. <br><br><h5>  WiFi </h5><br>  It seems that the antenna is not very powerful, but I really have no place to check.  In the city there are not so many WiFi points, and almost all are closed.  And before McDonald's, I have not reached yet.  At home everything works without problems.  Although it shows only 2 divisions out of 5 even at the router itself. <br>  By the way, by default, when Windows Mobile goes off, WiFi turns off in order to save battery, the only drawback is that when it wakes up, until WiFi has managed to pick up, programs quickly pick up GPRS and start using it, this is a little annoying.  On the other hand, if you actively sit at home on the Internet from your phone, you can turn off GPRS and not think about it (either turn off sleep or turn off WiFi). <br><br><h5>  GPS </h5><br>  It seems the problem is the same as that of other owners ( <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/gadgets/83212/">HTC Touch Diamond 2</a> , <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/phones/93853/">Sunno A880</a> ) - almost does not catch satellites.  Maybe somehow I'll get together and disassemble the device, look at the contacts.  Now I use external <a href="http://www.holux.com/JCore/en/products/products_content.jsp%3Fpno%3D351">Holux M-1000C</a> and do not have any special problems.  So for me it is not critical.  AGPS supported. <br><br><h5>  Radio </h5><br>  The presence of radio was one of the important features for me, the previous phone was without it, and if you don‚Äôt throw new music on it, then it becomes sad that everything is heard, the radio is somehow more fun. <br><img src="http://habreffect.ru/files/91c/ff3ee8b35/screen006.png"><br>  For the radio uses a very nice program. <br>  We have a hard time with the radio, in the sense that for almost any radio you have to play with the antenna and body position, the phone is no exception, in certain places of the city there is continuous noise, in others everything is good (and I also thought why I The Bluetooth-headset shuts up, it‚Äôs clearly visible on the radio that there is continuous noise in these places. The radio only works when the headset is connected. <br><br><h5>  Gravity sensor </h5><br>  The phone rotates in any direction, and <b>absolutely in all</b> applications, if you tick the corresponding checkbox in the sensor settings.  Those.  even if you took it upside down, it will rotate the application for you to be comfortable.  Well, as a bonus, turning off the alarm with a coup (although a bad feature, it will be necessary to turn it off, otherwise I will cut down the alarm clock without waking up). <br> <a href=""><img src="http://habreffect.ru/files/1b7/4f8d7e950/im7th.jpg"></a> <br><br><h5>  Camera </h5><br>  About her we can say that it is.  Photos are just disgusting (although comparable to Motorola).  2 megapixels, no flash.  Something is visible only in good light.  By the way, the Sunno A880 camera is better, 3.2Mpx with autofocus, so if the camera is important for you, then <s>do not look at the Chinese</s> at all, look at the other phone. <br> <a href=""><img src="http://habreffect.ru/files/87d/8d5c7a1e0/img011.jpg"></a> <a href=""><img src="http://habreffect.ru/files/d27/8c991542d/img012.jpg"></a> <br><br><h5>  Connect to computer </h5><br>  By USB, as a regular removable disk (only a memory card is visible) or via ActiveSync (although ActiveSync says that you can also use Bluetooth, but have not tried it).  During the connection, charging is in progress, WiFi is turned off, the Internet is taken from the computer, Windows happily synchronizes the phone with Outlook (hooray, finally this can be done without shamanism).  Actually, there is nothing more to add. <br><br><h5>  Vibro </h5><br>  Yes, it works.  As they like to say in the reviews, <i>‚Äúthe vibrating alert is average by force, you can not hear the sweatshirt in your pocket.‚Äù</i> <br><br><h5>  Sound </h5><br>  The external speaker is just disgusting.  At the same time, 70% of this disgusting makes the back cover, which simply vibrates and spoils the sound.  If you remove it, the sound becomes better, but still a little wheeze.  For calls come down, you can also listen to the radio, music and something decent is not worth it.  But very loud. <br><br>  The speaker for the voice is better, but also not ideal, the sound is not very good, but the interlocutor is audible, and there are no special problems.  With the microphone, too, everything is in order.  When you connect a wired or wireless headset, the sound becomes good. <br><br><h5>  Touch screen </h5><br>  First you need to get used to the force of pressing after that everything becomes comfortable and good.  I do not use the stylus, the interface is quite suitable for fingers, but in some places it is more convenient to poke a fingernail than the finger itself (or a toothpick).  The scroll is normally carried out by pulling, but if the program is not configured for this and starts to select, then you really have to aim at the scrollbar. <br><br><h5>  Working hours </h5><br>  It is very difficult to judge.  The fact is that Windows Mobile loves to sleep, turning off some modules (but the phone and Bluetooth work).  As a result, only ~ 7% of the battery goes out per night.  In this case, a couple of hours of active WiFi can very well hook up the phone.  Right now my phone shows 70% of the charge, 16 hours have passed since the last charge, during which time I used the phone as a navigator, listened to podcasts, downloaded fresh over WiFi, made several calls and played.  Seems not bad.  I think that if used as a telephone, it should be enough for 3 days.  (I can‚Äôt find out in any way, I still connect to the computer every day for different purposes, and he manages to charge). <br><br>  In this case, the battery does not seem to be very calibrated, for 100% there is still some, and when charging it can show 100% for a long time (but in the end it reports on the successful charge). <br><br><h5>  Other </h5><br>  The phone came to me with IMEI dropped into zeros, and although this did not interfere with the work, it was somehow inaccurate.  So I found out that it can be reflashed to any other easily enough.  Perhaps this will be useful information for residents of Ukraine, because  they have, as far as I know, some problems with gray phones.  You can take IMEI from your old Siemens C25 and flash it into this phone. <br><br><h4>  Windows mobile </h4><br>  Having read horror stories about Windows Mobile, about how terrible and slow the system is, when I saw it live, I was pleasantly surprised.  Those.  This, of course, Frankenstein, assembled from different pieces, with a completely inconsistent interface, in which nice solutions coexist with terrible, and each program has its own interface, the system works, and it works quite well.  In any case, I did not experience any horror, and feints with ears, editing the registry, replacing files and throwing my own into the Windows folder, are such relatives :) <br><br>  However, I‚Äôm not going to paint much about Windows; there are many reviews of the standard interface in the network, there‚Äôs basically nothing else.  The only thing that needs to be done is to put some necessary programs, without which happiness will be incomplete.  First of all, replace the standard keyboard (for example, FingerKeyboard), put Opera (although native IE is not so bad), and the rest is to taste (for example: Fring, Touch Response, Task Manager). <br><br>  The main surprise in Windows was the voice control, which is very powerful, but for some reason it only knows how to bind on the hardware button (i.e. it doesn't work with the headset), and if the phone is already in hand, then why use a voice? <br><br>  And the main joy: the dialer.  The ability to quickly select a contact by letter-digit led to wild delight.  For those who do not know, it works like this: you have a contact, Sergey, you open the dialer, press 7-3-7-4-3-9 and you have this contact right away (of course, if all matches are searched, so , if desired, you can stop earlier). <br><img src="http://habreffect.ru/files/a92/1c1c5d5a9/screen001.png"><img src="http://habreffect.ru/files/7a6/dd473cc2b/screen002.png"><img src="http://habreffect.ru/files/159/41414b85e/screen003.png"><br><img src="http://habreffect.ru/files/4a3/bb132d860/screen004.png"><img src="http://habreffect.ru/files/c37/f68482a4e/screen005.png"><img src="http://habreffect.ru/files/de3/33e1389b2/screen008.png"><br><br><h4>  General impressions </h4><br>  To be honest, I was surprised.  I took the phone to play and look at this miracle of Chinese industry.  But it turned out that everything is very good.  Well, yes, c GPS is bad, but the radio is more important to me.  And the rest of the 6000 phone features are very good.  We can take only Samsung Monte for such money, and this is a touchscreen phone without a qwerty-keyboard, on which you need to write an SMS to T9.  Well what kind of oddities?  And if you take more expensive phones, then there is already a choice, but they have the disadvantage that <b>they are more expensive</b> , while in everyday life, it‚Äôs not much better.  Anyway, in my opinion.  If you explain around the clock who on the Internet is wrong from the phone, then you might really do better, something like Motorola Milestone. <br><br>  But, I repeat once again, the phone impressed me, it was well-built, comfortable, it rings and is able to sit on the Internet. <br><br><h4>  Where can one buy </h4><br>  I bought on <a href="http://fastcardtech.com/goods-4336.html">fastcardtech</a> .  This store is not the cheapest (add another $ 41 for delivery and $ 9 for Paypal), but I liked it because they are really trying to sell it.  They answer users' questions, post pictures and videos, try to write the characteristics most honestly.  Simply, it seemed to me that the extra few dollars are not worth the fuss with other stores, it is better to pay them.  But the phone is in many others: <a href="http://solomobi.com/">solomobi</a> , <a href="http://allymobile.com/">allymobile</a> , <a href="http://mobino1.com/">mobino1</a> and others.  You can search by keywords Hitouch G5, Magic G5, Eris G5 and other combinations.  Keep in mind that this phone is produced in two factories, i.e.  as such, there are two models that are actually exactly the same, so look for the one that is cheaper. <br><br>  At the same time, if you do not have Paypal, then almost all the shops accept bank transfer and Western Union, so count the money (they can also make a discount for such methods), and choose a method convenient for you.  I chose PayPal because  the fastest and most reliable way.  The seller also insured and did not forget to make parcels in the PayPal tracking number, in case of clarification of the relationship.  But I think they will not be needed. <br><br><h4>  Specifications </h4><br>  Screen: HVGA 320x480 <br>  OS: WM6.5 (English) <br>  CPU: HiSilicon K3 460MHz (written by Qualcomm) <br>  RAM / ROM: 128/256 (written 288/256, really, on a clean phone, you can see 80Mb of RAM, 30 of them are free, 110Mb of free disk space) <br>  Wi-Fi, EDGE (GPRS), GPS, Gravity Sensor, Radio <br>  GSM 850/900/1800/1900 <br>  2Mpx camera <br>  microSD (8Gb works, 16 did not check) <br>  3.5mm headphone output. <br>  miniUSB input <br><br></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/93997/">https://habr.com/ru/post/93997/</a></p>
