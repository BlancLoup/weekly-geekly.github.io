  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Foxconn D51S - the right motherboard on the Intel Atom D510 for home NAS</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Almost two years ago, once again upgrading the computer, I realized that I no longer want to drive it around the clock.  Still, four weak processor cores, three hard drives, five gigabytes of RAM, and a pretty decent gifersin at the time - a non-optimal configuration for torrent-rocking.  And I decided to buy a NAS ... <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  Details of the epic can be found <a href="http://vilianov.com/hard_upgrade/vse_protiv_nas/">in a great article written hot on the heels</a> , but if briefly - I was deeply disappointed in the NAS on ARM-processors and assembled a small silent computer on the dual-core Intel Atom.  Put on it Windows XP and, in general, everything.  Torrents are shaken by normal uTorrent, video for PSP and iPhone is pressed by Xvid4PSP and HandBrake, data is being chased by REAL gigabit speed (for home-based NAS on ARM, this interface is present only for beauty), NAS can be remotely controlled from any system, including not my favorite Mac is - well, I was very pleased.  Especially considering the price of the solution. <br><br>  But in December, new Atoms were announced, and in March, the first mothers went to them.  Given that the performance of the kernel has not improved, there was no serious point in the upgrade.  But the ability to reduce the temperature inside the case by a few degrees and save a few watts per day was somehow seductive ...

Why her? <br><br>  1) One of the cheapest on the Atom D510 - $ 85.  Only Intel D510MO is cheaper (for $ 4), but it has a passive radiator.  This is good if the body is relatively large, and nothing serious than swinging torrents on a computer is not done.  I sometimes have a sausage all day long, and the chance of overheating is quite high.  Foxconn has a good cooler - not even a cooler, but a small impeller.  At maximum speed, it is almost inaudible, on average it is not audible at all.  This is especially pleasing in contrast with my previous mom, Intel DG945GCLF2.  There, the native cooler squealed like a little brazen pig, and it had to be urgently changed to a small Glacialtech. <br><br>  2) There are no whistles and fakes, like HDMI-ports and Wi-Fi.  For NAS, it is not necessary for nothing, and it charges the price fairly.  There is a feeling that the D51S was generally sharpened for industrial needs, because there is an LPT port and COM.  I will not do a robot-assembler of smartphones on mamma, but such sharpening is very useful for the 24x7 mode. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/ff5/644/026/ff564402641fd415ddbb5526f45541c3.jpg" alt="Foxconn D51S"><br><br>  3) Gigabit Ethernet.  Considering that I recently climbed to the <a href="http://vilianov.habrahabr.ru/blog/91007/">correct router with a gigabit inside</a> , it is not only pleasant, but also useful.  However, this dignity is a little strained, because today it‚Äôs not so easy to find a mother with a hundred megabits.  But probably. <br><br>  4) Two slots for DDR2 memory.  On the old mother was only one.  It is clear that such a system is not needed for huge amounts of RAM, but suddenly one day it will be necessary to roll the 64-bit axis ... <br><br>  In general, new clothes happy.  Inside the case, where there are two hard drives, it became colder and warms the soul that you use the latest generation of desktop "atom".  True, there is a feeling that the mothers will soon begin to stir up at an even faster and colder Moorestown, but I think it will stay until the autumn. <br><br>  By the way, don‚Äôt count it as an advertisement, but the guys who are most turned on the Mini-ITX in Moscow are sitting on <a href="http://www.dont.ru/">www.Dont.ru.</a>  Cases, mothers, small shnyazhki any - anywhere in such quantities you will not find.  If anything, say hello from me to the manager named Taras - he doesn't like this passion :) </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/93024/">https://habr.com/ru/post/93024/</a></p>
