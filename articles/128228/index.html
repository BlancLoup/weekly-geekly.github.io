This means that the benefits you can bring to the economy of Cambodia are about several tens of thousands of times less than if you were Angelina Jolie. <br>  True, Cambodia is a rare example: as a rule, when landing somewhere where another language is spoken, we plan to reduce our spending as much as possible, rather than engage in charity.  Since people have mastered the booking of tickets and independent compilation of routes, the most desperate chiptrip dreams began to come true one after the other: you will not surprise anyone with a burning ticket worth up to three hundred euros. <habracut><br>  The creators of the project <a href="http://svoi-ludi.com/">"Their People"</a> went even further: sending social vanity to the folder "Atavism", they learned to make interesting tourist routes, the costs of which can even be mastered by a first-year student of a humanitarian university, who earns a part-time job at his leisure.  <a href="http://wanted.vc/blog/%25D0%25B2%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BA%25D1%2580%25D1%2583%25D0%25B3-%25D1%2581%25D0%25B2%25D0%25B5%25D1%2582%25D0%25B0-%25D0%25B7%25D0%25B0-80-%25D0%25B5%25D0%25B2%25D1%2580%25D0%25BE/">+++</a>

In other words, girls weave baubles and make book cover designs, selling them at times at prices that can compete with products from some ‚ÄúRepublic‚Äù. <br>  Until recently, all these fruits of superhuman efforts were huddled in by specialized LJ, VKontakte communities and a couple of other sites with names that give memories of lessons in the palaces of the pioneers. <br>  The project <a href="http://martmania.ru/">"March Mania"</a> tried first of all to get rid of this raid of the "circle of creativity", closely adhering to such initiatives.  And at the same time to scale the project: in the end, handicrafts are the privilege of not only girls from LJ.  <a href="http://wanted.vc/blog/%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B1%25D1%2589%25D0%25B5%25D0%25B5-%25D0%25BC%25D0%25B5%25D1%2581%25D1%2582%25D0%25BE/">+++</a> <a name="habracut"></a><br><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/114/259/193/11425919369e7ed03dc517dc5b370426.png" align="left">  If the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãthe authors of the <a href="http://vionid.com/widget/">Vion Widget</a> project is sufficiently implemented, then the owners of the companies, as well as the employees of the same companies, will have to associate with it (and only with it!) The word "connection". <br>  The <a href="http://vionid.com/widget/">Vion Widget</a> application is needed in order to allow site visitors (for example, an online store) to contact the store operator with one click of a button - by phone, via video chat or text messages.  <a href="http://wanted.vc/blog/%25D0%25B3%25D0%25BE%25D1%2580%25D1%258F%25D1%2587%25D0%25B0%25D1%258F-%25D0%25BB%25D0%25B8%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B8%25D1%258F/">+++</a> <br><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/c45/2ec/115/c452ec115dc3d1b78889f7bdf0c2d6ed.jpg" align="left">  Service with a suspiciously reminiscent logo - from among the currently fashionable websites about budget mutual assistance (on Wanted.VC among them were, for example, <a href="http://wanted.vc/blog/the-theory-of-small-deeds/">LittleHelp</a> and <a href="http://wanted.vc/blog/%25D0%25B1%25D0%25B8%25D1%2580%25D0%25B6%25D0%25B0-%25D1%2582%25D1%2580%25D1%2583%25D0%25B4%25D0%25B0/">HelpHunter</a> ). <br>  <a href="http://uslooga.ru/">Uslooga</a> is a sort of Mr. Wolfe who solves problems.

According to a VTsIOM study, 48% of Runet users do not have social media accounts. <br>  Bringing these two facts together, the creators of <a href="http://nextgame.ru/">NextGame.Ru</a> decided to make their amusement park - but outside of social networks.  <a href="http://wanted.vc/blog/%25D0%25B0%25D1%2581%25D0%25BE%25D1%2586%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BB%25D1%258C%25D0%25BD%25D1%258B%25D0%25B5-%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B3%25D1%2580%25D1%258B/">+++</a> <br><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/981/772/d01/981772d012756274723f4fb00ae020d2.png" align="left">  Just a month ago, you learned from the GreenPeace blog that you can arrange separate collection of garbage in your yard, you only need to collect the required number of signatures from the residents of your porch and send them (signatures, not residents) to the appropriate authority.  Your enthusiasm diminishes approximately on the word ‚Äútenants‚Äù, which is not surprising: despite the minimum distance between the tenants of an apartment building, communication between them is usually minimized. <br>  <a href="http://domosite.ru/">DomoSite</a> is made just to establish this communication.  <a href="http://wanted.vc/blog/%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B5%25D0%25B4%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BB%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BA%25D0%25BE-%25D0%25BF%25D0%25BE-%25D1%2581%25D0%25BE%25D1%2581%25D0%25B5%25D0%25B4%25D1%2581%25D1%2582%25D0%25B2%25D1%2583/">+++</a> <br><br><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/402/947/2be/4029472bee2e8b95168b8e36c996962a.png" align="left">  The welcome letter you receive after registering with <a href="http://mindposter.ru/">Mindposter</a> is entitled rather straightforwardly: ‚ÄúWelcome to the Social Network!‚Äù. <br>  The imperial scope of the service is felt in everything, starting with the list of functions in the left column of the profile and ending with a softly popping soft sign in the word "like" - probably, sneaking there due to oversight, due to the deep immersion of the authors in larger problems.  And they, I think, are missing - the goals of the project, Artyom Patokov, his creator, describes with an appropriate breadth: ‚ÄúThe idea is to break existing stereotypes in Internet communication and IT as a whole‚Äù. <br>  We tried to participate in this experiment on consciousness.  <a href="http://wanted.vc/blog/open-minded/">+++</a> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/b37/305/032/b3730503283ad233b8e6302fa2cb4e71.jpg" align="left"><br><br>  Let's imagine an acid-green scheme of a building from the Matrix. <br>  Now imagine that the computers in this building are marked especially acid-green on it. <br>  Now try to distract from the acid-green color and the "Matrix" and imagine that what you have just presented exists in reality. <br>  Now add to the card a detailed description of the settings and configuration of each computer and the corporate network as a whole. <br>  The output should be approximately what the authors of the project <a href="http://www.combild.net/">ComBild</a> .  <a href="http://wanted.vc/blog/%25D0%25B0%25D1%2580%25D1%2585%25D0%25B8%25D1%2582%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BA%25D1%2582%25D1%2583%25D1%2580%25D0%25B0-%25D1%2581%25D0%25B5%25D1%2582%25D0%25B8/">+++</a> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/5b7/c10/719/5b7c107190b7f3b2f6cf3894527ead69.png" align="left">  Today is a rare case when we publish information about a project that has not yet reached the prototype stage.  Investments sought by the authors are needed just for the technical implementation of the project. <br>  In the meantime, the idea, well-titled "Anti-fraud," is waiting in the wings.  The authors shared with us the main thoughts about what it is.  <a href="http://wanted.vc/blog/%25D1%2587%25D0%25B5%25D1%2581%25D1%2582%25D0%25BD%25D0%25BE-%25D0%25B3%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B2%25D0%25BE%25D1%2580%25D1%258F/">+++</a> <br></habracut></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/128228/">https://habr.com/ru/post/128228/</a></p>
