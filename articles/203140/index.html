Apparently, the comrades liked the thing.  However, the material lacked clarification of many features of the device.  The comments were given links to the allegedly twin devices of other brands, and it wasn‚Äôt without aliexpress, <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/users/yurash/" class="user_link">yurash</a> spoke <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/users/yurash/" class="user_link">especially vividly</a> .  In general, I myself worked for quite a long time with Highscreen Black Box Connect, from which the whole topic of combining the camera of the recorder and the IP camera started at least in Russia.  Therefore, I decided to tell about my view of the model, and also did not bother to find out the history of its appearance. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/d53/e21/f1a/d53e21f1a5bd2ae16a8f02803effc791.jpg"><a name="habracut"></a><br><br><h4>  A bit of history </h4><br>  <i>Reading this chapter is strongly discouraged by those who wish to continue to think that B-brands only glue their nameplates on products from Chinese catalogs.</i>

      In the Russian market there are very often situations when the same external product (registrar) is offered by dozens of brands.  So much so that the poor Yandex.Market have to put photo models in different angles so as not to get whole pages of absolutely identical pictures.  More often, we are talking about twins, but using the example of <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/smartgadget/blog/184198/">AdvoCam and teXet,</a> I was convinced that there are curious exceptions.  In this regard, an illustrative situation has developed with Highscreen Black Box Connect, which reveals the curious aspects of the interaction of local B-brands and their Asian partners. <br><br>  Naturally, the Chinese electronics manufacturers have their own catalogs of finished devices.  And these same manufacturers, of which there are a lot in the Celestial Empire, regularly send spam e-mail boxes, including Russian companies.  The essence of the proposals is obvious - branding models.  Immediately, I note that this is not the only way that the second echelon fills up its range.  So, in one of these letters to Highscreen, among others, there was an IP camera, let's call it conditionally No. 1.  The model seemed interesting - on the one hand, compact from the point of view of the registrar, and on the other it attracts control from smartphones - which in Russia and for 2,000 rubles can already be bought.  In addition, at that time no one else in the country was selling Ambarella A7LS15 recorders. <br><br>  Of course, the primary issue was the relevance of having a display.  However, if you think about it, does the driver often use the screen in the registrar?  The first week - yes, it is quite possible.  So what is next?  The maximum that was previously systematically relevant - manual switching to night mode or the inclusion of anti-glare optics.  Now it is made automatically.  Camera position setting?  Similarly, only on a large screen with at least a 4-inch smartphone it becomes much more convenient than on any 1.5-2-inch built-in display of the "video witness".  Demonstration of video on the scene on the same small screen recorder is also not the best solution. <br><br>  First of all, it was proposed to "turn over" the device, because by default it is intended to be mounted on the table, rather than hanging upside down to the windshield of the car.  Leaving everything ‚Äúas is‚Äù and forcing the user to open the setup program each time to turn the picture would not be comme il faut.  By the way, I do not quite understand how this issue was resolved in the Defender WF-10HD, because he had the case left unchanged. <br><br>  The camera manufacturer resisted for a long time and did not want to present its product as a DVR in any way.  What I suspect is connected with the reluctance to make improvements and generally engage in "extra work".  A lot of time was spent on convincing the manufacturer.  As a result, among other things, it was required that the device skillfully make autostart recordings at power on and conduct a cyclic survey. <br><br>  In the future, Highscreen again had to deal with the reluctance on the part of the supplier to make improvements.  In particular, at a personal meeting in Hong Kong in April, it was said that certain features of the software could not be implemented.  To this, an objection was received that, with the presence of the source code, the specialists of Vobis could themselves finish the required moments in a short time.  On such "butting" it took about another six weeks.  In the end, ultimately practical everything was done as required in the understanding of Highscreen. <br><br>  The process of interaction was not built on a one-time receipt of the final result of the tasks.  There was a constant testing of new firmware from the Highscreen side, instructions were given, including the type ‚Äúthey didn‚Äôt do it, they didn‚Äôt add it here, they messed up here.‚Äù  Through the efforts of Highscreen, many changes have been made to the Unieye program, which is installed on the smartphone to control the camera.  So in its current form, the application on Google Play and the App Store is the result not least of the action of Highscreen. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/554/e27/544/554e27544b666588bd1d58c513d8f528.jpg"><br><br>  The result - in July, Highscreen Black Box Connect went on sale, and only after it similar solutions were ‚Äúpresented‚Äù by other brands, including local Chinese ones. <br><br><h4>  Equipment </h4><br>  The packaging of the device is quite a gift.  It is issued well, moderately bright and, what I liked most, extremely informative (from all sides).  From one side, we learn that it is possible to connect 4 cameras to the smartphone centrally at once, from the rear we see a visual scheme of online broadcasting.  Icons depicting the features of the model are attached. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/561/24a/d19/56124ad192a7b6d01ca35679791ba6aa.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/70f/673/ba3/70f673ba317590037f0b56f7af443916.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/102/8ec/993/1028ec9937a2375d80e6472fafe8fb29.jpg"><br><br>  A set of accessories is as follows: microUSB cables (two pieces, short and long), a pair of attachments for connecting with a bracket, a cord around the neck, a magnetic holder, a cigarette lighter charging unit, a mount with a vacuum suction cup, a warranty and instructions. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/7fc/c31/058/7fcc31058aeda6de6bf76e6ada8f814a.jpg"><br><br>  Now about some components in more detail.  The instruction is sound, ‚Äúpuffy‚Äù, all difficult moments of the recorder management are covered.  A lot of visual icons / pictures, color printing throughout the instructions also pleased. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/6a8/050/521/6a80505216a80e094caa09a77321b3f2.jpg"><br><br>  Not that it is very important, but there are two small intermediary parts between the recorder and the glass mounting, one of which is spare.  What is superfluous never happens. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/4f8/c12/fff/4f8c12fff6424a92ddb613cd29c2916a.jpg"><br><br>  The magnetic holder is well ‚Äúglued‚Äù to metal surfaces, including rounded like not the thickest pipes.  The contact side is scratched - only on the way, why it was to make it glossy I do not understand.  On the other hand, this part of the holder is still hidden from the eyes, but the visible upper platform has a raised surface.  That is, the propensity to scratch or accumulate fingerprints is not here. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/b1f/222/5be/b1f2225bef4365e896936879e91cec9a.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/3db/340/dfd/3db340dfd0859bc0a2d67f111698bb16.jpg"><br><br>  For the charging unit I shake hands with the developers, it turned out very cool.  Firstly, in form, this is not a dull ‚Äúsomething‚Äù of a wedge-shaped firm, as in most registrars.  Secondly, we are generally not forced to use the unit to power the recorder.  There are two free connectors by default, to which you can connect any required equipment.  In my opinion, this is best suited for a bundle of recorder plus a smartphone on charge. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/4a8/a97/5cb/4a8a975cb60da80d016e70884e73614e.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/3f6/738/d51/3f6738d5143d5eb9c1219775d94bf764.jpg"><br><br><h4>  Housing </h4><br>  Please note that the orientation of the Highscreen Black Box Connect is different from the original IP camera.  This was a consequence of the priority of shooting in the car - when mounted on a bracket, it can be seen that neither the LED icons behind the model nor the model name are ‚Äúturned upside down‚Äù from the front.  The body itself is the size of a matchbox, 48 x 48 x 17 mm can not be called bulky.  More or less covertly install the recorder behind the rearview mirror is quite possible.  Another thing is the front side is a diode, depending on the situation of the luminous green or red light - they say, smile, you are removed.  However, the brightness is low, so on a sunny day hardly anyone will see the indicator. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/7d4/ca7/146/7d4ca714653a863ee714a393b829e856.jpg"><br><br>  The case of the device is completely glossy with all the ensuing consequences.  Small scratches appear very quickly, should be handled with a registrar very carefully.  I can not answer the color combination of brown and black, in gloss they seemed more attractive than pure black or white pop.  By the way, there are no metallic elements, maximum - painting ‚Äúunder chrome‚Äù. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/e66/8eb/01c/e668eb01c2d293d158974631d7238418.jpg"><br><br>  To the left of the camera are the microUSB slot and microSD memory card slot. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/949/a56/a2c/949a56a2c910e231cb614a3592e678ec.jpg"><br><br>  On the opposite side, there are two buttons for controlling and powering and selecting the operating mode of the device. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/bdc/0da/433/bdc0da433eaa8d395cbc6093b55eb914.jpg"><br><br>  The only remaining button is set under the camera and stops / starts shooting in video mode or takes a photo in photo mode.  With the HDMI and AV outputs, the camera did not ‚Äúgrow together‚Äù, although I never needed both elements in the previous recorders - there is a small loss. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/e9f/8cd/aa6/e9f8cdaa68d0e8878bf4b9b118ae3fce.jpg"><br><br>  I note that the lace can be attached in two ways - there is a slot in the upper left corner or the ability to install a "middleman". <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/802/0bd/bca/8020bdbca81d892df07aeb59410fc439.jpg"><br><br>  On the back is a panel with four luminous (green / red / orange) icons, from left to right: connection status to the cloud, Wi-Fi point activity, photo mode, video mode.  I will not say that in the car I paid special attention to these indicators, at home the ‚Äúcloud‚Äù icon seemed useful to me.  Because the broadcast on the Internet starts up to one and a half minutes, and it is most convenient to monitor the status of what is happening just by the diode.  And there is not much choice for the varinatov, since with the launch, the Unieye program is automatically closed on the smartphone. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/d87/02f/3b6/d8702f3b6f603c60f79a5615738930cf.jpg"><br><br>  From the installation of the recorder in the car, or rather from the bracket, I still have a rather good impression.  Although I still consider the most ideal holder option on a single pivot joint.  I have no complaints about the mounting of Highscreen Black Box Connect in terms of size, it is actually the most compact bracket among those with a vacuum suction cup.  Position adjustment is possible in two planes.  Vertically we tilt the camera closer or farther from ourselves and fix with a clip.  Directly connecting the recorder occurs at the screw I dislike, when it is not always possible to fix the camera in the desired position from the first time.  I am impressed by the presence, albeit somewhat arbitrarily, of the possibility of turning the recorder from side to side.  Although, in fact, we just unscrew the camera.  To turn to the left, you need to make a full rotation along the axis, but the camera does not end up in the ‚ÄúI‚Äôm going to jump now‚Äù position - the latter requires three full turns. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/843/243/ae0/843243ae0fc0c045d8a8a0109066308d.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/ea3/ab8/40e/ea3ab840ec8ed5bde9615216d37489b2.jpg"><br><br><h4>  Wi-Fi, settings and all-all-all </h4><br>  The access point in the camera is activated automatically when it is turned on.  In my opinion, this automatically solves the important task of quick access to the video to view it "on site".  To access the settings and other management points, first download the Unieye program, which is easily found on Google Play or the App Store.  I checked the application on iOS and Android, the Unieye interface regardless of the platform does not change.  After launch, the program scans the available cameras and lists them.  Choose - connect. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/1b9/860/173/1b986017366f909bd6094ac4986a968b.png"><br><br>  I do not think that the main dialogue requires detailed explanations.  I note that in the upper left corner the device identifier is displayed, which can be changed.  Explanations require icons with video cameras - the button with red color starts the usual cyclic shooting, and with blue - continuous, with a stop when the memory card is full. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/256/6d3/200/2566d3200f9e84a96d9b44a13615adc0.png"><br><br>  If you rotate the smartphone in landscape orientation, the full-screen mode of viewing the picture from the camera automatically turns on.  The image is transmitted in degraded quality, apparently with the aim of preventing problems in low-power devices. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/a71/115/b48/a71115b488f1abb960cd860b742411e2.jpg"><br><br>  A few words about connecting a couple of cameras at once.  I happened to test the connection of four copies of Highscreen Black Box Connect at a time.  In principle, everything went fine, only switching between the camera did not happen very quickly.  In addition, Unieye suddenly requested a password for each camera, although there was no such default in any model.  Moreover, a separate "solo" camera connection still occurred without question.  In general, I had to really assign a password to each camera. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/29e/707/247/29e707247db5fdedd5bb9515157d986b.png"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/669/a4f/453/669a4f453cc02bc7a1bda3eb504d7b23.png"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/e8f/20f/61d/e8f20f61dbdcf1fb5ef925187d6695dd.png"><br><br>  There are very few settings, in the ‚ÄúCar Camera‚Äù section there are only three items: auto-start recording, motion detection (not to be confused with accelerometer) and shutdown delay.  For decency, I can grumble: there is no control over the exposure, options for the duration of the commercials ... Yes, everything seems to be all.  This is despite the fact that the unit drivers will ‚Äúdrive‚Äù by manually adjusting the picture through the same exposure.  As for the length of the rollers, usually there are options 1, 3, 5 or 10 minutes.  I think three minutes fixed in Highscreen Black Box Connect is a normal optimal indicator.  If I suddenly missed the absence of any important options - do not be angry, please complement me in the comments. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/515/c20/7db/515c207db23b4fa7413d370ce36d7107.png"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/bc3/002/d4e/bc3002d4e528509beea1ac5165b8e037.png"><br><br><h4>  Into the clouds </h4><br>  Online broadcast is conducted through the USTREAM service.  To start the broadcast, you first need to register, you can do it right in the Unieye dialogue.  Frankly, my registration attempt was unsuccessful.  That is, I started an account and quietly logged in through the browser.  But Unieye stubbornly did not want to run the broadcast in the recorder through my profile.  I don‚Äôt know, maybe USTREAM doesn‚Äôt like Yahoo mail so much.  My colleagues had no problems.  And thanks to Highscreen for providing a test account, it all worked right away. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/584/136/578/584136578a0a93b0bcfc07791fa85332.png"><br><br>  Broadcasting comes with a picture shift to about 15-20 seconds.  This is to use USREAM for full video chat does not work - only for purely observational purposes.  By default, the broadcast is open for viewing by anyone who wishes - it is only necessary to enter the user's account login in the search bar.  For password-protected broadcasting, you have to pay, here I would like to say a separate ‚Äúthank you‚Äù to USTREAM, because the monthly fee is $ 99.  And to buy back one single option in the pile of features of a premium subscription, of course, is impossible. <br><br>  The scope of application of direct output to a smartphone (without the Internet) varies depending on the user: video surveillance in a cafe (behind the hall), office (behind the staff), even the next room (after the child).  Do not forget about the possibility of organizing a system of four cameras, this will have to be very useful in a private house.  Online broadcasting, in my opinion, is useful in two main cases - when you want to show something, being far away from home (‚Äúsee which view from my hotel in New York‚Äù) or vice versa, look after the apartment / house / children, as it wrote @ NeoForce. <br><br><h4>  Video </h4><br>  Regarding the lens, there are no special details, and it is useless to look for some flagship glass optics here.  But on the processor should stay in more detail.  Installed Ambarella A7LS15 - this is not the same processor that is found in the notorious GoPro Hero3 Black Edition.  That is, both processors belong to the same series, but specifically the option in Highscreen Black Box Connect is its most budgetary representative.  And installed in the model precisely because it provides wireless communication and broadcasting on the Internet.  Minus processor - he can not stamp the date and time on the video.  Not very pleasant, but on the other hand, the absence does not make the record void to consideration in court. <br><br>  The autumn of this year stood out in my ‚Äúlocality‚Äù to be extremely punctual.  The first time I observe this, literally from the first days of September, the whole sky is in dark clouds, the sun appears on request for one or two days off.  This is me to the fact that the examples of the daily shooting I received do not reveal the full potential of the registrar.  Therefore, let me bring one of my own "overcast video" and supplement it with a "normal" daily recording from YouTube. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/1dMjIN6HTyU%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700023,15700043,15700186,15700190,15700253,15700258&amp;usg=ALkJrhjwXJM5PyN24H7562vF82aN4WEYfQ" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/CzCZpPKk3O0%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700023,15700043,15700186,15700190,15700253,15700258&amp;usg=ALkJrhiMPag5U85YIKLl9jNjWiQwpC6v2g" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  I don‚Äôt see any obvious "jambs" for an HD camera.  Yes, I almost forgot, the shooting limit is 720p, which is a processor limit, in any case, the manufacturer says so.  For an HD camera, the quality is normal, only the distance of readability of car numbers suffers.  About 15 meters we are not talking, although the model is more or less confident to see the numbers ‚Äúone building forward‚Äù. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/QQdWICKR_kQ%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700023,15700043,15700186,15700190,15700253,15700258&amp;usg=ALkJrhhAeNqz5o1d3rn4E101TWso-sQ9wg" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  Night shooting left me a good impression.  The picture is a bit "washed", but there is no roll of stars from bright light sources like lanterns.  Noise is moderate, do not throw much in the eye.  The readability of the numbers is there, but as in absolutely any registrar, it strongly depends on the position of the machines relative to each other and the difference in speed. <br><br><h4>  Conclusion </h4><br>  Highscreen Black Box Connect is sold for 4,490 rubles (~ $ 140).  If we take into account the set of possibilities of the model, this price tag seems to me normal.  In the end, now on sale there are a huge number of models with different functionality and, accordingly, the price.  In the case of Highscreen Black Box Connect, ideally it is assumed that the consumer takes not just a ‚Äúcool recorder without a screen‚Äù, but is really going to use the camera not only in the car.  If this condition is met, then the device will pay off the fastest.  You can go on the reverse - when you need a home IP-camera, it is convenient to combine its purchase with the acquisition of a recorder for the machine.  I can‚Äôt say that such hybrids are, in principle, particularly popular in Russia, but their release certainly contributes to the somewhat static market of recorders in terms of opportunities. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/203140/">https://habr.com/ru/post/203140/</a></p>
