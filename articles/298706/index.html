  <section class="page js-page"><h1>We will talk about how to increase sales in the network and why you need feedback</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  The company "East-West Digital News" in its <a href="http://el-business.ucoz.ru/Present/201312_ecommerce_1.pdf">study</a> on the development of e-commerce in Russia stated that in 2015, 44 million Russians took advantage of online purchases of goods, and the total market volume approached $ 27 billion. (More statistics: <a href="http://json.tv/ict_telecom_analytics_view/atlas-internet-torgovli-prognoz-segmentov-v-20152018-gg-20150519103348">here</a> ) . <br><br>  The situation was, of course, influenced by foreign economic sanctions, the final result of which is still unknown, but there was no catastrophic decline in demand and the growth trends remained.  This can only mean one thing; online sales are a fast-growing market, where competition is growing with each new site. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/506/6c5/330/5066c5330dee48738127709c986c8951.jpg"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  If you have a valid website, the store structure on it is well built and emails for customers are more stable than ever, but traffic is still poorly converted into profits - it's time to change for the better.  For a start, to establish high-quality feedback from site customers! 
      <br>
        <script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>
        <ins class="adsbygoogle"
          style="display:block; text-align:center;"

      Do not expect the client to open the mail program to write you a few lines - this is almost unreal.  The feedback system will help in many cases, whether it is collecting customer contact information during non-business hours, chatting about the properties and characteristics of the product, or obtaining information about the services and functions of the product through a callback widget from the site. <br><br>  When you can contact and speak with the visitor in person, you will have more chances to understand your audience and learn how to properly convey the benefits of your product, and most importantly, more chances to sell the service.  The easiest and cheapest way to establish <a href="http://cashmyvisit.com/%3Futm_source%3DmegamozgVidObratnoySvysi%26utm_medium%3Darticle%26utm_campaign%3DCashMyVisit">feedback from the site</a> within 5 minutes is to install a software product that includes all the necessary settings and free technical support.  Among the directions can be identified at least three main ones: chats, a call from the site, polls and reviews. <br><br><ul><li>  <b>Chat</b> </li></ul><br>  This is a program that allows users to exchange messages in real time.  Even if the basic information is already present on the site, the client may still have additional questions.  For such moments there are online consultants.  In the chat window, the client can ask a short question in writing and in a couple of minutes get a detailed answer from the manager. <br><br>  Example: JivoSite. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/c4f/8b1/be0/c4f8b1be0c1d4942a85cd647cf6438bd.png"><br>  The site offers special offers for mobile chats, which becomes more relevant every day (see the Mobilegedon article).  There is analytics on visitors to the site, their behavior, assessment of the quality of the services provided and pleasant trifles, for example, the text that is displayed to the visitor before it is sent.  It is possible to use a set of "quick phrases", blocking, providing possible information about the client. <br>  Rates start at 474 rubles.  for the operator per month, but the price is reduced when you pay immediately for six months or a year. <br><br><ul><li>  <b>Call from the site</b> </li></ul><br>  This feedback form is for those cases when you are ready to receive incoming calls from customers and engage in personal sales. <br>  The program motivates the user to enter a phone number and get a free connection with the company's employees in a matter of seconds.  Thus, the system satisfies all client requests immediately after the first visit to the site. <br><br>  Example: Cashmyvisit. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/a82/b19/fed/a82b19fed4c34d9d8418450d5d1b256a.png"><br>  Such a program on average doubles the conversion from the site.  You get help with setting up the system, the ability to listen to calls and connect unlimited phone numbers of managers, a call button to the site, a window with an individual appeal to a client who came to the site from an advertising campaign. <br>  Payment occurs only for real conversations with the client.  There is a free test period - a week, after the price per minute varies from 13 to 19 rubles, depending on the credits to the balance (The more, the lower the price). <br><br><ul><li>  <b>Survey form, feedback and suggestions</b> </li></ul><br>  This is a form where a visitor can leave a question or opinion about a product, company or website and get a direct response to it from a company representative.  At first glance, the questionnaire on the site is not the most productive type of feedback, because it requires the maximum amount of time from the client.  But in fact, it all depends on what form you offer to fill out to visitors. <br><br>  Example: Userecho. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/c77/c58/9af/c77c589afc6345bb8d02f2472bdfc745.jpg"><br>  The program has a database with data on all previously asked customer questions and suggestions, a system for processing requests from VIP clients (private request) with an online chat and a forum for questions and answers.  You can try the program for free, but the constant application will cost from $ 15 per month. <br><br>  <b>Total</b> <br><br>  Feedback systems are created for those who independently develop their business or website.  You will receive a guarantee of the quality of communication, the ability to easily manage settings and analyze all available data about visitors to the site. <br><br>  The choice of necessary programs is completely determined by the theme of the site and, to be honest, by your preferences. <br>  For an online store, we advise you to pay attention to chats and calls from the site; this is the most appropriate form of communication with customers for sales.  Systems for feedback and suggestions will suit sites that are important to provide customers with answers to frequently asked questions, while leaving them in front of other visitors.  For example, firms providing legal and real estate services. <br><br>  <b>Promotional PS</b> <br>  Entrust feedback from your site in <a href="http://cashmyvisit.com/%3Futm_source%3DmegamozgVidObratnoySvysi%26utm_medium%3Darticle%26utm_campaign%3DCashMyVisit">good hands</a> . </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/298706/">https://habr.com/ru/post/298706/</a></p>
