But the fact that the study was conducted on programmers who had an average of 7 years of development experience with minor deviations, no one knows. <br><a name="habracut"></a>

    <h4>  But it was a long time ago and in the study a lot of mistakes ... </h4><br>  Similar studies were repeated by other groups of scientists for 30 years: <br><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Research list</b> <div class="spoiler_text"><ul><li>  Curtis, Bill.  <b>1981</b>  "Substantiating Programmer Variability."

And also showed no relationship between productivity and work experience. <br><br><h4>  What does it mean? </h4><br>  Since 1968, literally everything has improved in development: languages, frameworks, tools, and also programming have now been taught for several years in high school.  Nevertheless, the productivity of programmers was different at times 30 years ago, and it is different today. <br><br>  This suggests that there is some X-factor, not related to experience, which distinguishes a good programmer from a bad one.  At the moment there is no consensus on what the factor is.  Some say that it is the ability to plan their work and ‚Äúsee‚Äù the structure of the code before the code is written.  Others say that the most productive programmers are those who can quickly produce a visible result.  My personal observations suggest that those who can read the code write the code best. <br><br><h4>  And now what i can do? </h4><br>  If we discard the ethical side of the issue, then we must dismiss all low-productive programmers, regardless of experience.  Seriously, given the facts above, you can recruit a small team of relatively inexpensive, but highly productive, programmers.  And it will be many times more profitable than keeping a staff of experienced professionals. <br><br>  Another conclusion that contradicts logic a little, but is often met in practice: the programmer will not become more productive, having received years of experience.  The only way to improve the productivity and quality of code for programmers is to conduct targeted education and training. <br><br>  Last but not least, we need to strongly revise the method of hiring programmers.  Instead of dropping out by keywords in a resume and logic tasks, candidates need to write code, preferably in ‚Äúlaboratory‚Äù conditions, so that they can track productivity and quality. <br><br><h4>  Conclusion </h4><br>  We must understand that productivity is not the same as efficiency.  In the modern world, where the complexity of technology grows faster than people manage to study technology, where any problem has more than one solution, where most of the code is already written, it‚Äôs not the programmer‚Äôs productivity that comes to the fore, but the ability to find and combine ready-made solutions, as well as the ability to come up with a non-standard solution.  But the larger the project, the more important the productivity and quality of the code, and, the more important, the selection and training of the team. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/209646/">https://habr.com/ru/post/209646/</a></p>
