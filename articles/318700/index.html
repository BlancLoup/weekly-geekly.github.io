The development of the genre</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/4f2/c2d/93b/4f2c2d93bfe85bfee7f30940f0285af2.jpg" alt="Brave train"><br><br>  It all started with the fact that I got a test task for a Unity-developer job: write a game "Snake".  A little later, for subjective reasons, I had to give up the vacancy, but by that time I had already started to do the project and, in order not to disappear, I decided to develop it, finish it and release it.  So I got my own Snake, which I never intended to do before. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  I always strive for originality as much as possible.  In this case, the task turned out to be non-trivial - snakes of every kind are a dime a dozen!  At first glance it seems that nothing new can be invented.  But this is only at first glance.  Even the most hackneyed idea can be revived, and there is an infinite number of original options - you just need to sit down and think carefully. <br><br>  I began, as usual, with a study of existing projects in the market.  I reconsidered many nice snakes!  In addition, by the time we started working on the game (spring 2016), there were two more projects in this genre that became very popular - these are ‚ÄúSnake Legends‚Äù and ‚ÄúSlither.io‚Äù.  ‚ÄúSlither.io‚Äù certainly impressed with its simplicity and dynamics, but I somehow wanted a static field and a single-player, so I paid more attention to ‚ÄúSnake Legends‚Äù - I liked the camera position in it, and I decided to take it as a basis his game this kind of playing field.

Reduced, of course, bursting. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/5cd/a0c/acd/5cda0cacd09b6c79cfb225dd6f7d2d1d.png" alt="Idea number 1"><br><br>  <i>Pros:</i> visually - not a snake, but an unfamiliar image. <br>  <i>Cons: the</i> gameplay will be very similar to ‚ÄúSnake Legends‚Äù. <br>  <i>Conclusion:</i> we need to think further, to develop the idea. <br><br><h3>  Idea number 2 </h3><br>  A child walks around the playground and collects toys.  In order to put them in a snake, he pre-assembled wagons.  That is, the drafting of the snake takes place in two stages: first you need to pick up an empty platform that will ‚Äúbuild up‚Äù the snake, and then pick up a toy that will take the platform.  This process can be done randomly, for example, first dial 3-5 empty platforms, and then collect only toys.  There are also ‚Äúhigh‚Äù cars (not platforms) that build up a snake, but do not give a seat for a toy, thus complicating the game.  On the field at the same time there is a limited number of cars and toys, for example, 2 cars and two toys. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/65b/bee/c1a/65bbeec1a428e96b38c183a310dc2aa0.png" alt="Idea number 2"><br><br>  <i>Pluses: it is a</i> lot of pluses. <br>  Firstly, absolutely original gameplay. <br>  Secondly, ample opportunities for visual diversity: cars, toys, various characters as a child - all this should look good. <br>  Thirdly, because  conditions are quite complex, it becomes possible to issue tasks.  For example: ‚ÄúCollect 7 toys for such and such a time‚Äù or ‚ÄúCollect 5 bunnies‚Äù.  And this is a variety of levels. <br>  Fourthly (as a continuation of the third), the ability to build both levels for the passage and an endless game mode "for survival". <br><br>  It would seem that here is a good idea for the game, and I, indeed, worked it over for a long time and in detail.  But not finalized.  A traitorous thought settled in my head: ‚ÄúIsn‚Äôt it too difficult for a wide audience of players?‚Äù  As a result, one fat <i>minus was formed:</i> ‚ÄúToo difficult,‚Äù which made me think further in the direction of simplifying the rules. <br><br><h3>  Idea number 3 </h3><br>  From the previous idea we remove the second stage of the snake collection - the selection of toys, leaving only the trailers.  Different trailers.  Also remove the child from the field - we get a simple and understandable train.  But we add meaning to the cars themselves, more precisely, to the fact that they are different: let them be reduced, as in the games "Three in a row".  Three identical cars were assembled in succession - all cars of this type were cut from the train. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/dee/4ca/304/dee4ca30441c759f59bfafb479f72b84.png" alt="Idea number 3"><br><br>  As a result, we have even more <i>pluses</i> .  This is the originality of the gameplay I was aiming for, and the ‚Äúendless‚Äù game mode: collected ‚Äî reduced, and the player's urge to think about the sequence in which to collect cars, and not to miss everything.  Also, simplifying the gameplay: operating with one level - the train, and not two - with the train and toys.  "Three in a row" requires to make the cars multi-colored, bright and different in shape - the snake will be colorful. <br><br>  <i>Cons</i> were not noticed.  My thoughts finally led me to a slim concept.  Googling, I did not find anything like it.  If not, you have to do it! <br><br>  Then began thinking about the details, taking into account the very first wishes for the game. <br><br>  1) We make small-sized game locations: so that, on the one hand, there is where to go, and on the other hand, there is where the snake‚Äôs tail begins to disturb us.  For a change, we make these locations slightly different in size. <br><br>  It was experimentally established that the field of 8x8 cells is not enough and there is nowhere to turn around, and 20x20 cells on mobile devices look very small.  The result - four locations of medium size 10x10, 12x12, 14x14, 16x16.  Why even - I do not know.  So historically. <br><br>  2) We make a limited number of locations: several thematic episodes with 4 locations, so as not to get bogged down in the process of creating a game.  For the release do one first episode. <br><br>  Since  Our train grew out of a child with balls, then we leave it a toy.  But he will ride in places that are not intended for children at all: in the first episode - on the roadway, in the second - on the construction site.  And all this is connected with such a topic: a brave train on a remote control helps the boy to collect scattered cars where it is dangerous for the boy to be. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/889/fb9/fc6/889fb9fc6cdd4281a245bff3a9d783e0.jpg" alt="Locations"><br><br>  3) As in the classic game "Three in a row" we will charge coins for the reduced identical cars.  The main goal of the game is the accumulation of coins. <br><br>  Moreover, our locomotive has interesting combinations, when the cars, which have closed after the contraction, again form a "winning" combination and are again reduced.  Perhaps 4 consecutive cascade cuts - by the number of colors of cars.  For each next cascade double the number of prize coins. <br><br>  4) Additionally, we diversify the gameplay with all sorts of bonuses that help our little engine.  Unlike the cars that fall on the field and remain on it, until the engine picks them up, the bonuses will be dynamic, disappearing after a certain time.  Ie, you want a bonus - you have to have time to pick it up. <br><br>  In the course of the game, the speed of the train grows and the battery sits down.  This is also offset by special bonuses. <br><br>  5) The ability to change locations directly during the game.  On the field, the key periodically drops out, picking up which, the train will be able to go to the opened gate to a new location. <br><br>  6) The ultimate goal of collecting coins is to buy new locomotives, each of which has unique characteristics. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/d15/cec/1bf/d15cec1bfb72f6a8bad67eb390dd5005.jpg" alt="Locomotives"><br><br>  7) A large number of multistage tasks of the type ‚ÄúCollect 200 coins on a hard difficulty level‚Äù.  Three rankings of players in terms of difficulty. <br><br>  All these ideas, after intense and not very nine months of nightly work, resulted in the game ‚ÄúBrave Train‚Äù - a mixture of the genres ‚ÄúSnake‚Äù and ‚ÄúThree in a row‚Äù.  The release on Android took place on December 22.  I invite everyone to the Play Market to evaluate the result. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/1fc/5da/4d2/1fc5da4d2584156279d36749fb8d2d3d.jpg" alt="Brave train"><br><br>  To summarize, I want to say that I was pleased with the work done and, I think, I was able to accomplish the task set - to develop the classical genre.  If you have any ideas for further development of the topic - I propose to discuss in the comments. <br><br>  <i>PS</i> Riddle for attention: guess what was the prototype for the entourage of the first episode? <br><br>  <i>PPS</i> I myself thought a little ‚Äúsnake + three in a row‚Äù, so I am already preparing an update for the ‚ÄúBrave Train‚Äù: ‚Äúsnake + three in a row + puzzles‚Äù, in which on the field, in addition to cars and bonuses, it will be possible to select parts of puzzles and then fold them. <br><br>  That's all.  I hope it was interesting. <br>  Happy New Year, everyone! <br>  Implement your plans and the sea of ‚Äã‚Äãnew ideas! </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/318700/">https://habr.com/ru/post/318700/</a></p>
