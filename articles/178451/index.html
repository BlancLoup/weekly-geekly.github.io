As they say: fresh, not known by the Corporation and its search engine sufficiently.  Our service is dedicated to online claims management, as well as related document management. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/93e/6dc/fb5/93e6dcfb5f440c41b500d4494620da0c.jpg"><br>  Interested - please under the cat ... <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br><h4>  About insurance in Europe and in the west.  Problem </h4><br>  The insurance market is very different from the Russian, and the entire CIS.  Medical services, life insurance, auto, property, real estate, liability to third parties, and much more.  Including the annual tax return, possible tax deductions - everything is different here, and everyone considers his own penny.  Such a culture.  For example, medical insurance is mandatory in most countries and may be about 10-15% of the monthly (!) Family income.

      Mere mortals, the users of these services have to rake a bunch of bills for payment and papers that still arrive by regular mail (good, works quickly and accurately), pay, send to the insurance, demanding compensation. <br><br>  Most of them keep copies or original accounts, and in a couple of years they accumulate a decent amount of documents that may be needed sometime (but more often not) and clutter up the living space of the above mentioned mere mortal. <br><br>  Individuals who do not differ in pedantry in collecting and storing documents may lose their hard-earned money by first paying the bill from their own pockets, then forgetting to send it to the insurance company for compensation ... If they remember, they will have to ask for an extract of the copy, but they won't remember will remind. <br><br>  Although, how sad it is to lose the original bill from a dentist for 1000 euros and not receive the due hundreds of euros compensation.  Our friend in this case will have to ask for an extract of copies, and so on.  After that, he begins to store resolutely all documents that come in the mail. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/12c/4aa/063/12c4aa063bc06c5a55189890c992c2e0.jpg"><br>  And we will not even touch on the topic of organizing, filtering and sorting of these documents, a normal family of 3-4 people who are not very ill ... <br><br>  Another problem, possibly facing the user of insurance services and, of course, an honest taxpayer, is a possible tax refund (part of it).  The fact is that at a cost of more than a certain amount per year, the taxpayer is entitled to a tax deduction.  But then the question arises - how to track all payments for the year (run through all the archived pieces of paper) and decide on what to write in the tax return? <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/476/2ac/245/4762ac24550c14639003d73b479b5887.jpg"><br>  To solve these two and many other problems, the online service <a href="http://unadox.com/">unadox</a> was invented. <br><br>  It is very important for us to get feedback from the audience of Habr, who happened to live outside the borders of the CIS, who are familiar with the problem firsthand and could evaluate the service offered by us in relation to his case. <br><br><h4>  Description of the service </h4><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/2e8/436/aac/2e8436aac32d7de26c7c828e59c42250.jpg"><br>  The use of the service should be minimized by the user, already burdened with a routine associated with this issue.  The principle and idea is very simple.  Today, most users (who are willing to entrust their documents to the cloud) have a mobile phone (rather, even a smartphone) with support for mail and a camera that replaces the scanner.  The user photographs the received document (or several) and sends it to a special email address of our service.  Having received a letter from a registered user, we save the information from the received message, create a claim, which is visible only in the user's account.  We inform him of the successful registration of the application by e-mail. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/472/b02/96a/472b0296aeeeddf649ad86b6f6a238c9.jpg"><br>  Naturally, the user can do exactly the same actions from the screen of his PC by logging in under his account. <br>  The following functionality is also available: <br><ul><li>  Cost analysis and compensation received </li><li>  Organize and filter the list of applications (claims) </li><li>  Editing applications, their status and data on costs / payments, commenting applications </li></ul><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">application life cycle in detail</b> <div class="spoiler_text">  An application created via mail or a web interface begins to live its own life.  And you can say goodbye to a pile of papers.  Send them, as you usually do, to your insurance company and wait for the payment.  In the meantime, 30 days begins to be counted (by default and customizable), after which the system will remind the user that he has an open request.  It should be noted that 30 days is the standard time for paying bills in Europe.  In this simple way, we remind the user that it is possible for him to react, to contact the insurance company and find out why the payment is delayed: perhaps there is a lack of documents or (oh, horror!) They were lost.  In this case, all the user needs to do is send the copy of the document stored in the application again.  If compensation was received, close the application and enter the data on the amount received, in order to use this data in the future to make a decision on possible tax returns at the end of the year. </div></div><br>  Of course, our system is suitable for almost any type of insurance claims, not necessarily medical.  We assume that it can also be useful for insurance brokers doing business with their clients. <br><br>  At the moment, the main user interface language is English, but in the near future we will connect the most popular European languages, such as German, French and Italian, and later Spanish with Portuguese, etc. <br><br><h4>  Have read "Rework" - and forward </h4><br>  Conducting expensive marketing research on the subject of ‚Äúwhether the idea will work‚Äù means and time was definitely not there.  In time, the book came to hand, repeatedly praised by habrazhiteli: <a href="http://37signals.com/rework">Re-Work</a> from 37 signals, and it started ... <br><br>  Our lead developer recommended using Django to implement the service and program most of the business logic in Python.  Our technical kitchen is described below - deploy if interested. <br><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">some kitchen for those interested</b> <div class="spoiler_text"><ul><li>  Means of project management, tasks - Trello.  We use a model that is the basis of Extreme Programming for planning (and some other methodologies): User Stories and Engineering Tasks. </li><li>  Manage code, wiki, bugtracking - bitbucket.org </li><li>  Box.com has become our ‚Äúbox‚Äù for documents. </li><li>  Servers running Ubuntu 12 LTS.  Hosted in a private cloud, as well as in the Amazon AWS cloud.  To test the free version of the system EC2 turned out to be enough, we pay a little extra for traffic with snapshots. </li></ul><br></div></div><br>  There are 3 people in our team today: developer, tester and project manager.  Depending on the tasks, each of us is able to perform other functions.  We attracted third-party artists and designers and are very pleased that we have our own beautiful logo and artwork (examples in the article). <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/d08/fa7/8c3/d08fa78c3a803ba40932c778d4b2803e.jpg"><br><br>  The development process can not be attributed to either XP or Agile - we are too small to limit ourselves to such a framework.  Nevertheless, we regularly organize intensive sessions (conference calls), where we actively solve problems that require joint work.  Tasks are grouped by iterations, which last 1 month.  After testing, we jointly close the tasks, designate new ones, and discuss existing problems and ways to solve them.  Such ‚Äúsubbotniks‚Äù help us to progress and coordinate our efforts for the next breakthrough. <br><br>  ... such is our kitchen ... <br><br>  The functionality of the system will constantly expand, but the cost of the service will remain equal to the price of a bottle of cola - the amount that everyone can afford. <br><br>  You can follow the news of the project on our <a href="http://blog.unadox.com/">blog</a> or subscribe to <a href="http://twitter.com/unadox">twitter</a> , and if you <a href="http://unadox.com/sign_up/">register</a> now while we work in the public beta, you will be able to use our service for free throughout the year. <br><br>  We will be happy to deploy a well-reasoned discussion.  This is the first attempt to write for habr, so do not judge strictly, but rather give good advice. <br><br>  We also value the opinions of security enthusiasts.  Dear colleagues, if you find any problems - write in a personal.  We will be very grateful, ready to cooperate. <br><br>  <i>NB While this article was being prepared, it turned out that the insurance ‚Äúforgot‚Äù to compensate the author for payments made more than one month ago.</i> <i><br></i> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/178451/">https://habr.com/ru/post/178451/</a></p>
