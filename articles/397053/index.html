Unlike the IT industry, the market is not yet full, competition is weak.  But for some reason, the counters do not break from Wi-Fi-controlled kettles, stoves with a webcam in the oven and other familiar items.  On the other hand, many people have released vacuum cleaning robots, and over the past ten years they have moved from the category of wonderful wonders to the category of assistants for housewives.  Among other innovations, communication skills are most in demand, and the average price for robotic cleaners has decreased. <br><br> <a href="https://geektimes.ru/company/gearbest/blog/279902/"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/2c2/26d/d94/2c226dd94d209892f1e5a8fd1d7d0a51.jpg"></a> <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  <a href="http://www.gearbest.com/robotic-vacuum-cleaner/pp_360769.html%3Futm_source%3Dgeektimes%26utm_medium%3Dyulia%26utm_campaign%3Dg16">JISIWEI S +</a> is one of the representatives of modern dust collection equipment for the house with the ability to remotely control. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/93a/5f5/287/93a5f5287081910997701cb60e0c3d2b.jpg">

      But first things first. <br><br>  JISIWEI, a little-known company in Russia, produces the only model of the robot vacuum cleaner in four versions: S + Silver, S + blue, S + red, S +.  They differ in color design. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/da3/363/38e/da336338e48e7d84841efa81c68161bf.jpg"><br><br>  The latest version of S + (or, to be more precise, S + Gold) will be described in detail. <br><br>  Cardboard box, a little less than five kilograms in weight, contains a robot vacuum cleaner and accessories: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/68d/d90/ecc/68dd90ecc06e41843bc9af7bcc01e091.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/79f/958/0be/79f9580be817943be70afd866ae97a62.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/7fd/240/351/7fd240351ceb43d3a4f52a4c897be9a3.jpg"><br><br>  Among the latter, two additional brushes, microfiber lining (with and without a base plastic base), a spare coarse filter and a brush with a scraper. <br><br>  If desired, the robot can be controlled in the old manner, via the IR remote control. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/ab0/cee/baa/ab0ceebaa0d300ef3271963b15e43861.jpg"><br><br>  S + is a circular disc with a height of 85 mm and a diameter of 350 mm.  Only two brushes protrude beyond the body, pushing debris from the corners to the dust collection hole. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/d19/785/d75/d19785d7571309de313598a608fb2c65.jpg"><br><br>  The highest part of the S + is a projection with a camera, sensors and an indicator: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/a17/377/3a3/a173773a3f209ac2b956c78bac49aec8.jpg"><br><br>  There are only three brushes - two in the nose and one perpendicular closer to the tail: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/e7b/dbb/92c/e7bdbb92c443736af9e3c09fd8d19933.jpg"><br><br>  There are also three wheels: two leading and one auxiliary, freely rotates around a vertical axis. <br>  Height sensors are located only in the front and side parts, the dust collector completely occupies the back <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/175/7ad/099/1757ad099ad5b8d636b20e791a9ce174.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/5c1/d23/a01/5c1d23a01bf723b28b9473f5df5484f0.jpg"><br><br>  It is a mechanical brush and a soft plastic scraper. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/f66/0cd/604/f660cd604470bb849c80680f48614ff9.jpg"><br><br>  All debris accumulates in an easily removable container with an integrated pre-filter. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/098/b04/729/098b047299a3cc8a7f08e49ef71506a3.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/681/3ad/be9/6813adbe91c82c5042e89e109079b8d1.jpg"><br><br>  For filling the built-in S + battery with a capacity of 2600 mAh with electricity, it is possible to double the connection of the charger: through the docking station or directly into the slot on the case. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/8e1/c7d/33c/8e1c7d33cced3dbc06a83776aa97c1ed.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/72e/3d2/b6c/72e3d2b6c3b2e8641cf962db98ccc5ba.jpg"><br><br>  Two spring-loaded pin contacts at the station are in contact with metal plates on the bottom of the robot;  calls in to refuel the S + independently, focusing on the signals of the beacon installed at the top of the docking station. <br><br>  To use the power adapter is used. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/c82/f94/780/c82f94780559d832a67a3fe513c91b47.jpg"><br><br>  It takes about 3.5 hours to fill the battery with electricity. <br><br>  The main control element is a screen with touch buttons in the center of the case. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/ca4/ac3/868/ca4ac3868a98c57606e9ab6301730426.jpg"><br><br>  In the absence of other S + control methods, these three sensor buttons are enough to control the basic functions of the vacuum cleaner.  But the motto of this model is ‚ÄúNot Just A Robot‚Äù, which hints at an expanded range of possibilities.  Those become available after installation on a smartphone running Android or iOS applications JISIWEI Robot. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/b1c/faf/d8b/b1cfafd8b5d3aaadc508c07310925d77.jpg"><br><br>  Since the interface is adapted for smartphones with a smaller screen size, on the tablet used, the title window looks empty. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/03c/878/c27/03c878c277e9eccf44f7dd751215f990.jpg"><br><br>  After registering on the site and initializing through a QR code on the robot, it appears in the list of devices available for connection. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/828/01f/72a/82801f72a4dd43f69b0ae411b7602da1.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/112/378/adc/112378adca7dcfeb28fa104dd1638cb4.jpg"><br><br>  Connection with S + is established via Wi-Fi channel, for which it is necessary to transfer the connection parameters (network name, password) through the application.  The process looks original: the program first requests the username and password from the user, and then whistles their robot through the dynamics of the smartphone.  As soon as the connection is established, the corresponding icon on the vacuum cleaner lights up. <br><br>  A successful connection with the S + allows you to control the mode of operation of the vacuum cleaner and look at the world through its eyes. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/921/3a2/a92/9213a2a921ba3d3ecbaf772ba587922b.jpg"><br><br>  It was not possible to achieve better quality over remote connection.  Photos made by the corresponding button in the application and saved on the smartphone look a little better. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/f49/238/e5b/f49238e5bb7925e82fd8f21b863a962b.jpg"><br><br>  The main disadvantage of the camera is a high demand for light and difficulties in displaying pictures in motion. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/cd2/d63/00f/cd2d6300fcd12919dca79e9e97d8ae18.jpg"><br><br>  However, you can control the position of the vacuum cleaner and control its movements with a virtual joystick. <br><br>  Various settings of the connection and mode of operation are set through the menu <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/d8b/472/6fc/d8b4726fc3696c15c354709155888166.jpg"><br><br>  Unlike standard test zones for vacuum cleaning robots, so often used in reviews, JISIWEI S + was tested on two apartments.  The first is used little, constantly contained in the frequency and differs extremely low clutter (things on the floor, wires, often moved furniture).  The second belongs to the leading active lifestyle family with three children of different ages and cats.  As a result, the abundance of foreign objects on the floor and the constant formation of small debris. <br><br>  Several test cleanups showed that medium and large debris (designer‚Äôs spilled screws, pieces of packing foam, napkins, etc.) S + collects well, though not quickly.  With fine dust and hair of animals, the situation is more complicated, since the frontal (auxiliary) brushes are not capable of raking them well.  Long garbage (hair, thread) is often wound. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/aaf/58f/24b/aaf58f24b04be2436eb789a4c029cd0a.jpg"><br><br>  The main brush remains almost clean (photo after two full containers and 4 hours of work). <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/9bd/4bd/5c1/9bd4bd5c186e6fafa8a56848e0f2428e.jpg"><br><br>  Cleaning the container and brushes does not take a lot of time, since all the nodes involved in cleaning can be easily disassembled without the help of tools, and the complete brush-scraper helps in getting rid of debris stuck in the cracks. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/418/62c/26d/41862c26df2ea65a76522d5a2fd0ac85.jpg"><br><br>  Permeability is average.  He handles the stools, tables, chairs and other furnishings perfectly: either he can move it, or he can be cleaned from all sides.  But if the obstacle is 10‚Äì15 mm high (the threshold, the tubular leg is captured above in the photo of clothesline drying), then there is a high probability of jamming (the sensors determining the obstacle are much higher).  Also loosely scattered loops of wires will be taken away around the room.  On his own base calls in without errors and on the first attempt, if it is installed against the wall. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/938/03d/216/93803d216e772e57d5dd2ce2eba72998.jpg"><br><br>  There are several modes of operation: zigzag movements, spiral, ‚ÄúBrownian motion‚Äù;  possible turbo mode, which increases the speed of rotation of the main brush.  With an abundance of litter, it reduces the cleaning time of particularly polluted areas, but the operating time from a fully charged battery falls from 100 minutes (normal mode) to 60. The noise level is much lower than that of a regular household vacuum cleaner, and it fits into the declared 50 dB. <br>  For a visual demonstration of the work process a few short videos. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/e6K7Pk8XRyM" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Ww_qzHTX4Ow" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  Complete microfibre linings are designed for wet cleaning, but the real benefits from them are possible only in small rooms (up to 10 sq. M.): Once wetted microfiber dries quickly and collects a significant amount of dust, after which it must be washed again. <br><br>  The overall impression of JICIWEI S + is positive.  I must say that taking vacuum cleaning robots (regardless of the manufacturer and model) as a complete replacement for traditional manual cleaning methods is not worth it.  This is a good solution for maintaining cleanliness in the apartment, especially if there is not enough time for a full cleaning during the working week.  Perhaps remote control, but before that it is advisable to make sure that there are no ‚Äúdifficult zones‚Äù by driving S + around the apartment several times and watching the work. <br>  The basic characteristics of a vacuum cleaner: <br><table><tbody><tr><td width="300">  Vacuum cleaner model <br></td><td>  <a href="http://www.gearbest.com/robotic-vacuum-cleaner/pp_360769.html%3Futm_source%3Dgeektimes%26utm_medium%3Dyulia%26utm_campaign%3Dg16">JISIWEI S + Gold</a> <br></td></tr><tr><td>  Dimensions <br></td><td>  350 x 85 mm <br></td></tr><tr><td>  Weight <br></td><td>  3.2 kg <br></td></tr><tr><td>  Trash bin capacity <br></td><td>  0.5 l <br></td></tr><tr><td>  Battery <br></td><td>  Li-Ion, 2600 mAh <br></td></tr><tr><td>  Supply voltage <br></td><td>  14.8 V <br></td></tr><tr><td>  Battery life <br></td><td>  Up to 2 hours <br></td></tr><tr><td>  Noise level <br></td><td>  Up to 50 dB <br></td></tr><tr><td>  Wireless connection <br></td><td>  Wi-Fi <br></td></tr><tr><td>  Video camera <br></td><td>  1 megapixel <br></td></tr><tr><td>  Price <br></td><td>  $ 400 <br></td></tr></tbody></table><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Cashback up to 25%!</b> <div class="spoiler_text">  For those who have a Webmoney wallet, the time has come for good news: the Gearbest website offers products at great prices, a special flash sale, prizes, and, of course, cashback. <br><br>  So, only when paying via Webmoney, you can buy the <a href="http://ru.gearbest.com/robotic-vacuum-cleaner/pp_366723.html%3Futm_source%3Dgeektimes%26utm_medium%3Dyulia%26utm_campaign%3Dg16">ILIFE X5</a> robot vacuum cleaner for $ 65 on sale, the <a href="http://ru.gearbest.com/tablet-pcs/pp_413825.html%3Futm_source%3Dgeektimes%26utm_medium%3Dyulia%26utm_campaign%3Dg16">CHUWI VI10 Plus</a> tablet <a href="http://ru.gearbest.com/tablet-pcs/pp_413825.html%3Futm_source%3Dgeektimes%26utm_medium%3Dyulia%26utm_campaign%3Dg16">priced</a> at $ 86, a pretty portable <a href="http://ru.gearbest.com/speakers/pp_428619.html%3Futm_source%3Dgeektimes%26utm_medium%3Dyulia%26utm_campaign%3Dg16">Xiaomi Mi Rabbit</a> wireless speaker for only $ 11 and much more.
