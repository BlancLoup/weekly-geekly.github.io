      Let's remember, call tracking is a tool for analyzing the effectiveness of advertising campaigns on the Internet by tracking calls from potential customers.  Technology associates every call to the company with the behavior of a specific site visitor.  Thus, we can track the visitor‚Äôs entire path from the beginning of the search to the call: referral source, search query, session time, activity on the site.  The service also allows you to divide all calls into target and non-target (for example, the wrong number), primary and repeated, processed and skipped. <br><br>  <b>How it works?</b> <br><br>  Using categories, this tool combines web analytics and traditional offline sales.  If you come from the technical side, each site visitor is assigned a unique phone number for a predetermined time. <br><br>  Such an assignment of the number to the visitor is the main functional mechanism for call tracking.  And the time at which the number is fixed for the user, determines the efficiency of the entire system.  If the time is out and the call never took place, the number will be shown to another user.  It turns out that a too short reservation time may reduce the accuracy of the collected data, and too much - to increase the cost of purchasing numbers. <br><br>  <b>Why do you need research?</b> <br><br>  It is exactly the same and will help determine the optimal time to fix the number.  Knowing when visitors most often decide on a call, and having approached the pinning time to this value, we will be able to determine the most efficient algorithm for the work of call tracking.  And as a result - reduce the error in accounting calls during analytics. <br><br>  <b>Initial data</b> <br><br>  The main participant in our study was the company UIS, intending to implement a call tracking service on its website.  Participation in the study helped UIS specialists determine the optimal time for assigning a number to a visitor, taking into account the professional nature of the company. <img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/421/d61/717/421d61717231498c96a1d4dab6b17c93.jpg" alt="image" align="right"><br><br>  First of all, we asked colleagues from UIS when, in their opinion, the visitor makes the first call to the company. <br>  Opinions of employees diverged, and the overall picture was shared between the four main options.  The majority of UIS employees surveyed (40%) suggested that calls arrive at the company within the first 15 minutes.  Another 20% of respondents believe that potential customers take at least an hour to think.  30% of the team are convinced that visitors need a whole day to resolve the issue, and the remaining 10% of UIS employees agreed during the week. <br><br>  <b>Go!</b> <br><br>  In order to confirm or dispel the assumptions of our colleagues, we selected a pool of 5000 numbers and set up a dynamic call tracking on the UIS website (B2B, telecom).  The number of numbers was chosen based on the weekly attendance of the company's website for contextual advertising Yandex.Direct.  Each visitor to the UIS site saw their unique phone number assigned to them for a period of 7 days. <br><br>  Over the next month, we recorded all calls to the company from visitors who have switched to the site from advertising channels.  The result is a table of this type: <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/bec/713/9ca/bec7139ca91544fa8ef307e565a4a190.jpg" alt="image"></div><br><br>  Then repeated and non-target calls were excluded from the sample.  Thus, we were able to allocate only targeted calls from potential UIS customers.  Based on the collected data, it was possible to obtain the following: <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/b02/c5f/50c/b02c5f50ca564226a3f6cfa8797d56bc.jpg" alt="image"></div><br><br>  According to the results of the sample, we observe that the lion‚Äôs share of all calls (91.4%) to the UIS company occurs within the first half hour after the visitors went to the site.  And the vast majority of them occur within the first 15 minutes.  The remaining 8.6% of visitors "stretch" the time of contacting the company from 31 minutes to 7 days. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/fc1/ff1/235/fc1ff1235dcf49b282629974cc520874.jpg" alt="image"></div><br><br>  Another important aspect is the distribution of calls by the number of visits of visitors to the site: <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/d13/808/a06/d13808a06dec453592c054f93714226e.jpg" alt="image"></div><br><br>  We see that approximately ¬æ of all the first calls to the company are made during the first visit to the site.  Here, several factors can influence the decision about a call: novelty, high interest, the urgency of solving the problem and the need for clarification.  The remaining quarter of the first calls are almost equally divided between users who came: the second time, the third time, and the fourth time in conjunction with all subsequent visits. <br><br>  It is also important how the calls are distributed, based on the number of pages viewed: <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/de7/157/e34/de7157e34f7b49958ba7365670c24f6b.jpg" alt="image"></div><br><br>  Most of the calls (35%) are made from the first opened page of the site, which largely indicates its informativeness.  In other words, a potential customer gets enough input to make a call decision.  Another quarter of the site visitors (25%) decide to call from the second page.  Interestingly, almost as many (22%) call, having already viewed more than four pages of the site.  This suggests that a significant part of the audience prefers to study the company and its proposal in detail before making direct contact. <br><br>  <b>Total</b> <br><br>  Considering the fact that the dominant majority of UIS website visitors (82.4%) call the company within 15 minutes and mostly after viewing 1-2 pages, we can say with confidence that to reach and track the maximum number of calls (82.4 % / 15 min. + 9% / 30 min.), It‚Äôs enough for a company to assign a unique number to the visitor no more than half an hour after the transition to the site. <img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/a0c/fe6/62d/a0cfe662dd3f43659497dcca3005224e.jpg" alt="image" width="250" height="272" align="right"><br><br>  In the analysis of the results plays an important role the scope of the company and the needs of the target audience.  A potential UIS client is an entrepreneur or top manager who is constantly looking for an effective tool to improve business performance and improve management.  It is important to understand that the tasks that UIS solves are vital for any company at a certain stage of development.  A tight work schedule of top managers and the need to quickly solve business problems greatly affect the speed of decision making. <br><br>  <b>findings</b> <br><br>  How can such a study help companies? <br><br>  In order to determine the optimal time for securing a number, it is important for companies to take into account a number of factors: the nature of the target audience, a segment (B2B or B2C), field of activity, degree of necessity of a product or service, as well as conditions affecting the purchase decision. <br><br>  Accurate determination of the number fixing time allows companies using the CoMagic service to correctly analyze the behavior of visitors and build effective communication through the site.  This data will become the basis for correct analytics and forecasting, reduction of advertising costs and optimization of budgets.  The use of additional tools, such as sitephone (callback from the site) and lead generators, allows you to speed up the decision-making process and encourage users to call.  Thus, the use of call tracking in combination with related services provides an integrated approach to improving site conversion.  By the way, you can learn more about the effectiveness of the sitephone and the lead generator in our next articles. <habracut></habracut></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/286750/">https://habr.com/ru/post/286750/</a></p>
