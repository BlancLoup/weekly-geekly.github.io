Well you, Neznamov, twist and vague and ambiguous terms!  I will begin with an explanation, but the post is not about these terms, but about what changes in business are necessary in a crisis in order to develop. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  <b>Unique selling proposition (UTP)</b> is a declared advantage that is unique in relation to the product and important and meaningful to the consumer.  That is, among other sellers of goods, the offer should not be repeated.  And besides that it should be unique, it should be popular among the audience.

      The following term is much more complicated.  It is collective, new, everyone understands and interprets it in his own way.  And the word ‚Äúcustomer-oriented‚Äù shudders many marketers because of the populism of the concept.  But still‚Ä¶ <br><br>  <b>Customer loyalty</b> is a characteristic of customers, determining its commitment to a supplier of goods (services), approval of its goals, means and ways to achieve them, and openness of its consumer motives for the company. <br><br>  <b>Customer focus</b> is a complex term that has not yet been formed clearly and unequivocally.  But I found a very specific definition of it, no matter how strange it came <a href="http://msk.treko.ru/show_dict_764">from psychology</a> .  Customer focus - when the company does not seek to impose or advise, but to provide a non-evaluative (consultant‚Äôs refusal to evaluate the product preferred by the client in terms of ‚Äúgood‚Äù or ‚Äúbad‚Äù) and a friendly atmosphere to help the client explore the need and solve it.  If you operate with the words that marketers use, then customer orientation will turn to face the customer and decide the issue from his point of view, not the manufacturer or distributor: not to impose your product on him, but to find the most suitable option for the customer. <br><br>  What do we get in general? <br><br>  <b>Customer-oriented loyalty program</b> - a program that creates a welcoming atmosphere with customers by offering relevant, popular and important services for the audience (additional services) associated with the purchase of goods / services, to create a commitment to the company's customers (initiator of the loyalty program), adoption and approval of goals , means and ways to achieve them, the openness of their consumer motives for the company. <br><br>  Any comments? <br><br>  Now let's go back to the beginning, sorry for repeating, but still: <br><br>  ‚ÄúIt's no secret that most online stores (including the so-called‚Äú leaders ‚Äù) still do not have a clear unique selling proposition (TSS) and / or customer-oriented loyalty program (KPL), except for discounts‚Äù <br><br>  What does it mean?  Often the fact that many companies either did not understand the new conditions of work in the market, or did not accept them, or are trying to survive, wait out the crisis, due to the established client base. <br><br>  That is, earlier, when customers themselves were looking for a reliable supplier of goods and services, it was possible to take customers barehanded, without much difficulty.  Average / high prices, average level of service, poor program of supporting relations with regular customers. <br><br>  I know, not by hearsay, that few people thought about creating a worthy loyalty program, when the customers themselves threw the crowd, it was enough for some kind of discounts.  Also, not by hearsay, I know that in new conditions, customers are looking for better deals to get the same goods and services on the market.  That is just to survive at the expense of the existing base, without doing anything at all - the path to the abyss.  Difficult times will not soon, so customers will have time to run up before the market starts to grow. <br><br>  The owners of the stores that collected cream in the pre-crisis times still often recall: ‚Äúoh, how good it was then, what sales, how many customers‚Äù.  That's bullshit!  It‚Äôs time to think "this month \ quarter profit has increased \ fell by N% compared to the past, something needs to be done about it."  All market conditions have changed, gentlemen!  Now the pickiest client dictates the conditions, the economic situation dictates the conditions.  The entrepreneur can dictate terms only at the same position of the client when the company needs goods and services, and in the role of the employer.  It is necessary to use both of them! <br><br>  And customers provide a new unique selling proposition!  Yes, yes, it's about time.  It was already time to wake up from the shake-up, stop lamenting about the failed plans.  It's time to work.  Develop unique sales offers and customer-focused loyalty programs.  Now only these competitive factors can bring back customers and increase your profits.  It's time to find your own unique development strategy for the company and the online store.  It is necessary to develop more attractive sales proposals that allow saving time and material resources of customers.  The one who offers the best quality of work at the most reasonable prices will pick the jackpot and become the new leader. <br><br>  And it's not just about lowering the prices of the product range.  Look wider, look for alternative ways to save customers' cash.  Offer more service, better quality, for the same money, let's get more product with more ultimate savings. <br><br>  It is necessary to give more and better, but not cheaper and less.  Those who do not understand this will leave the market. <br><br>  The future behind the shops, which will give unique sales offers to the audience, will find a specialized and promising niche and provide customer-oriented service among the faceless hordes of old-format stores selling goods, rather than services. <br><br>  Yes, yes, exactly like this: ‚Äúold format stores selling goods, not services‚Äù!  Tens and hundreds of stores sell the same product.  A popular and up-to-date service (services) that customers will receive in addition to the product (and not stupidly discounts), this is what the store offer can distinguish among faceless masses.  This is the new format, for which the future. <br><br><h6>  My specific example </h6><br><br>  Now I am launching a program called ‚Äúrehabilitation‚Äù to return old customers and attract new ones.  The main emphasis will be placed nevertheless on those who have previously collaborated with us at least once.  After we get the customer base in a new, structured way, I will change the company's strategy. <br><br>  First, after NG, a new functionality for the store will be launched. <br><br>  Secondly, the pricing policy and discounts will be changed, but this does not significantly affect the existing price order, otherwise it may scare old customers. <br><br>  In relations with the audience, the emphasis, again, will be placed on regular customers, a ‚Äúclub‚Äù will be created, the participants of which will get BIG advantages.  It will not be just a discount club, there will be customers who trust us and whom we trust.  And nothing else.  It is mutual trust that will allow us to give a unique and exclusive offer to each client.  This is not a rant, I already know how to do it in an automated form in the new functionality.  And the current customer base will be the test site - we will manually work out a part of the future program. <br><br>  I do not want and I will not disclose competing information about this UTP, because there is no such thing in Runet and Uanet, and if someone thinks of such a thing, then I will try to be the first.  But I will definitely tell you when everything will work and make a profit. <br><br>  Author: Anton Neznamov, blog: <a href="http://www.nezname.com/">marketing online stores</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/74258/">https://habr.com/ru/post/74258/</a></p>
