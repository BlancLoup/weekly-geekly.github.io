I will say right away that this post is <b>not an educational program</b> for Golos.io.  Fortunately, there are enough of them: <br><br><ol><li>  Like <a href="https://golos.io/ru--golos/%40aleco/podborka-statei-o-platforme-mediablokchein-golos-rekomendovano-kazhdomu-dlya-prochteniya">here</a> </li><li>  Or via <a href="https://wiki.golos.io/">wiki</a> </li><li>  Or very short and fast in the <a href="https://youtu.be/8a0TPACOu2k">video</a> </li></ol><br>  Similarly, I don‚Äôt want to talk about the technical component of Golos, although even according to general data, it‚Äôs <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3D9Bh-v_KBobc">impressive</a> : <i>in fact, Golos is a blog with advanced social networking features, where you can not just like to like, but also make money on marketing (promoting the post, voting for it) ) on the one hand, and on the other hand, by giving out excellent content, to get your hard-earned money on it.</i> <br><br>  I would like to turn to those components that often (like, for example, in the Bitcoin community today) do not see technology: organizational and ideological, no matter how it sounds.

      <b>I will explain.</b> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/611/f77/61e/611f7761eaed43d580ce5e72cac18390.png"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  First, Golos (I know that this is Steem's fork) is the first Russian-language platform that really works and creates what I would call the media 2.0: when not just whales (i.e., those who are big invested in the ICO and in general in Golos), but dolphins (regular users) can in fact influence that, a) what news will be popular and b) what can be banned in the community altogether. <br><br>  For example, today there is the Culture of the Voice, where the issue of authorship and the legality of the content is resolved: passed verification - make a repost.  Did not pass - be kind, seize the flag (aka remark). <br><br>  Why do I think this is important?  Firstly, because it is at least some movement towards decentralization.  Yes, there are still whales who strongly influence the results of the vote, but at the same time, everyone has the opportunity to write something good and get into the TOP.  According to my observations - literally everyone. <br><br>  Of course, there remain such disadvantages as pleasing the public and other manipulations, but still they are noticeably less than in the world of centralization.  The most vivid example is the BM (I do not want to write them completely)). <br><br>  BMSchiki invested well in the ICO and received, respectively, considerable power in the Force to vote.  But the community reacted pretty quickly.  And as a result, even on reports, say, the attendance of a resource is divided into 2 components: with BM and without BM.  Thus, the amount of investment directly in this case does not affect the popularity.  Of course, there is an opposite effect from such a PR, but I‚Äôm exactly saying that ‚Äúthe more money, the more popular the author,‚Äù as it is in a number of current media (TV especially), it‚Äôs not about Voice. <br><br>  For example, there is an <a href="https://golos.io/%40ivelon/transfers">account</a> that at the time of this publication costs about 4,000,000 rubles, but to say that the author would be extremely rashly popular. <br><br>  That authors differ from investors, curators, developers, miners.  And this is wonderful in my opinion. <br><br>  Can an investor "order music"?  In general, yes.  But there always remains the position of the society, which, for example, may incriminate a disagreeable (say, clearly advertising) post and all efforts in the other direction will simply be in vain. <br><br>  The second thing I love is Golos, is the payout option.  Firstly, their ideology itself is quite logical, and therefore it is interesting to me (but this does not mean that there are no flaws in it): the curators vote, because they themselves receive a reward;  the authors write because they vote for them and the more (though not quantitatively, but the Strength votes in the first place), and thus they get every chance for a good reward for honest work;  Investors are waiting and earning on the fact that more authors come to the platform (they are also commentators), and with that, popularity is growing and, as practice shows, the price of tokens.  And, of course, miners and developers do not stand aside. <br><br>  For example, now there are several areas in the development of clients for the Voice - and this is also good and interesting, because  creates competition in the best sense of the word. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/2b2/d55/08a/2b2d5508ae6c4202915ed5fc2716bcee.png"><br><br>  PS to the picture - <a href="http://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/golos/">growth</a> in itself is not an indicator for me if there is no growth of the audience and its interest (involvement) behind it.  In the meantime, he is just present. <br><br>  Not least in the whole process is the <a href="https://golos.io/ru--golos/%40golos/otchyot-o-prodelannoi-rabote-komandy-golosa-za-15-05-2017-21-05-2017">reporting</a> from the team itself: transparent, simple and accessible.  Again - questions appear, but they are happy to answer. <br><br>  In addition, the motivation system embodied in the blockchain itself is also interesting because on the one hand, it is important and interesting for a person to vote up to 40-50 times a day (in various articles, it was this range that was found: from 20 to 50), and on the other hand, this is not the same as likes, say, vk or facebook, because, first, you can get very specific money for this;  secondly, it makes no sense to like everything: popular materials are needed and then the success of large payouts will be much closer. <br><br>  Finally, Golos, again - as I see it, is very interesting for very young authors who want real money and know how to write (even though poems, although interesting analyzes).  For example, without great stress, the value of <a href="https://golos.io/%40itsynergis/transfers">my colleagues' account</a> reached almost 15,000 rubles.  For a good developer or even a copywriter, these are pennies, but for a novice author, the most important thing is to set the first goal, say, in the form of a smartphone. <br><br>  <b>So, the results are as follows:</b> <br><br><ol><li>  At this stage, the crowd marketing strategy of the Voice is showing itself as a fully working and effective tool.  What will happen next?  It depends on a) how the community is formed;  b) where will the authors (including third-party developers) direct the platform;  c) of course, globally there is a dependence on the blockchain industry, where everything is too <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/post/324670/">good</a> so far. </li><li>  An audience of 6,000 people is far from the limit.  There are certainly common risks of <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/post/325554/">blocking</a> , but who does not have them today?  I think that when you reach 100,000 - growth will be exponentially.  Or earlier? </li><li>  The payment system seems to me regulated.  Some nuances are not satisfied from time to time by authors / miners or someone else, but nevertheless, paragraph 1 (see above) is important here, and not by itself monetization for the sake of monetization. </li></ol><br>  <b>What would I like further from the Voice?</b> <br><br><ol><li>  Most importantly, technical decentralization should always presuppose social decentralization.  In Bitcoin, for example, this is not so that it is clear what I mean.  No longer. </li><li>  So that as soon as possible more people were trained to publish right in the blockchain, since  The situation with PD and the media, especially in the Russian Federation, is very, very ambiguous. </li><li>  Finally, I would like to continue to see direct interaction with the community, but I think there are no problems here. </li></ol><br>  <i>PS If you want numbers - they will still be, and also - already there (see links).</i>  <i>If you have questions - ask.</i>  <i>If in doubt, voice, because</i>  <i>At the time of launch, I had a lot of doubts about the Voice.</i> <br><br>  UPD.  Who is not at all aware of Voices - I recommend this, a very short <a href="https://youtu.be/8a0TPACOu2k">video</a> . </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/329252/">https://habr.com/ru/post/329252/</a></p>
