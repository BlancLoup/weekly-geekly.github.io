  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Aircraft modeling - the first model</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  This is a continuation of my note ‚Äú <a href="http://rednaxi.habrahabr.ru/blog/90669/">Model</a> aircraft <a href="http://rednaxi.habrahabr.ru/blog/90669/">- the beginning of a long journey</a> timed to the day of cosmonautics and aviation. <br>  In this post I want to tell you about my first (and only at the moment) model aircraft. <br>  Again, I repeat that I am a beginner in aircraft modeling, and comments and corrections from more experienced people are welcome. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  So, after one and a half months of training, I finally bought my first model. <br><h2>  Select the first model </h2><br>  Here I will consider only the purchase model, because  I myself have not built a model with 0, I can not tell you anything. <br>  So, we need the first model for the initial training of flight skills.  I‚Äôll say <b>that this is an expensive business</b> . Buying a flying toy for 2-3 thousand rubles in the ‚Äúchildren's world‚Äù can only discourage further desire to engage in aircraft modeling. <br>  The first model should have the following basic quality: to <b>be easy to manage</b> . <br>  Therefore, there is a certain stereotype of the first model: <br>  - upper wing layout <br>  - relative large v wing (i.e. the wing halves are not on one straight line but at an angle) <br>  These two qualities provide stability in flight. <br>  Under these parameters gets a lot of different planes. <br>  It is also believed that the larger the aircraft, the easier it is to manage.  It is partly true, because the wind affects the larger aircraft less.  There is also another point of view - the bigger the plane, the more expensive it is to repair it: D <br>  Also, when choosing the first model, it is necessary to determine what is closer - internal combustion engines (smelly and farting) or electric motors (from which, by the way, you can get sound like from DVSa) - without dirt and stench, but with expensive batteries.  For the price, in principle, it turns out that, and also by the flight time - that the battery, that a standard tank lasts an average of 10 minutes of flight. <br><br>  I chose for myself the ICE coach 1.8 meters wide. <br>  Next will be pictures of my aircraft at the moment, after 3 repairs, so it may not look very presentable in places :) <br><h2>  The internal structure of the model </h2><br>  My plane looks like this at the moment: <br><img src="http://img717.imageshack.us/img717/4765/dsc00043uc.jpg"><br><br>  The engine on it is one of the budget, ASP 52. the number means the engine size is 0.52 cubic inches. <br><img src="http://img695.imageshack.us/img695/3014/dsc00044sv.jpg"><br>  The internal combustion engine runs on methanol with an admixture of nitromethane (I fly on fuel with 5% nitromethane).  Engine lubrication oil is contained in the fuel itself.  The engine is hot, you can see that there is a candle in the cylinder - when you start the engine, a glow is put on it after the engine is turned off and the fuel is detonated from compression.  In some cases, the onboard temper is used, which keeps the tension on the candle - for example, during winter flights at low temperatures.

      The fuel tank is standard, 250 milliliters, enough for ~ 10 minutes of flight (and you don‚Äôt need any more, by the way, you get tired and attention is dulled) <br>  Buck stands under the "hood": <br><img src="http://img532.imageshack.us/img532/8168/dsc00047a.jpg"><br>  Sponge and tape - the model model's best friends - excellent materials for fixing parts inside the fuselage - and springing - compensates for the vibration, and keeps it pretty well. <br><br>  From the tank goes 3 tubes: <br><img src="http://img179.imageshack.us/img179/2806/dsc00049oq.jpg"><br>  one, which is plugged with a bolt - refueling, is made to fill fuel into the tank. <br>  The second goes to the carburetor and delivers fuel to the engine. <br>  The third connects the tank and the muffler and is needed for boosting the fuel tank - because  there is no fuel pump, the engine fuel sucks including.  and thanks to the boost in the tank from the muffler. <br><br>  Next, let's see what is inside the aircraft: <br>  The wing is removable and is mounted on the gum, under the wing is all the electronics: <br><img src="http://img149.imageshack.us/img149/2015/dsc00046wa.jpg"><br>  Here we see 3 servos: <br>  - to control the throttle <br>  - for elevator <br>  - for rudder <br>  In addition to servos, there is an on-board battery (the usual nickel-metal hydride, at 6v, 1200 mAh, the charge is enough for a day of flight - 5-6 tanks), and the receiver is the receiver the most important part of the on-board electronics.  in case of receiver failure, the aircraft loses control.  The receiver is wrapped in a separate layer of foam rubber to reduce vibrations. <br>  The receiver itself looks like this: <br><img src="http://img197.yfrog.com/img197/4365/dsc00056qf.jpg"><br>  Servos and an onboard battery are connected to it, an antenna comes out of it, which is laid along the fuselage. <br>  Also on the photo of the fuselage inside you can see the cord that sticks out.  It is needed to connect the servos, which stands on the wing and controls the ailerons: <br><img src="http://img263.imageshack.us/img263/5015/dsc00050ig.jpg"><br>  Sometimes they put 1 servo on the wings, sometimes 2. In principle, the ailerons are needed to set the plane to roll - hence when 1 aileron moves down, the second goes up - it means that 1 servo is enough in the case of a trainer.  But there are special cases - for example, when a plane of large mass and force on the ailerons must be applied more - they put a servo on each aileron (and sometimes 2).  Another 2 or more servos are put on the wing when you need to make <a href="http://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%25A4%25D0%25BB%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BF%25D0%25B5%25D1%2580%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BD%25D1%258B">flaperons.</a> <br>  In general, the wing assembly looks like this (against the background of the balcony door so that you can appreciate the scale): <br><img src="http://img23.yfrog.com/img23/1807/dsc00051ia.jpg"><br>  On the lower part of the wing are colored stripes so that you can navigate - in what position is the aircraft at the moment.  I repaired the wing after the crash and completely re-wrapped, the repair did not affect only the ailerons, so the stripes are blue on them and on the wing of a different color, brighter. <br><br>  From servos to the control planes go thrust, which are connected with them through the pig, here it looks like an example of thrust to the rudder: <br><img src="http://img683.imageshack.us/img683/6020/dsc00052ks.jpg"><br><br>  The on-board electronics are turned off using the switch, which is rendered a little before the wing: <br><img src="http://img402.imageshack.us/img402/5410/dsc00048qw.jpg"><br>  According to the rules of safety, you must first turn on the transmitter and then the on-board electronics, and after landing, respectively, first turn off the board, and then the transmitter.  Therefore, the side switch should be easily accessible. <br><br>  That's all :) <br>  Everything is pretty simple.  In total, the aircraft weighs about 2.5 kg, in principle, about 500-700 grams of useful mass, it can easily lift (that is, without significant deterioration of the flight characteristics). <br>  The only thing - the greater the mass, the greater the landing speed. <br><br>  The plane was repaired 3 times already. <br>  1 time I threw it on the wing on landing - I flew into too strong wind, I could not land, I grabbed the ground with a wing, half the wing was splintering - I went and bought balsa and plywood, I restored it in the half that had been preserved and re-tightened. <br>  2 times I asked the girl to hold the plane while I was going to start it, and she accidentally broke my keel with her heel - the lower half of the keel came to be cut out of balsa again and glued into the fuselage. <br>  3 times the chassis fell apart - he didn‚Äôt buy new wheels, made his own hub and restored the chassis. <br><br><h2>  Issue price </h2><br>  Immediately mark the price because the question periodically pops up.  Here I list what I took for myself, the option is quite budget. <br>  <b>What you need to take immediately:</b> <br>  Simulator <a href="http://www.aerofly.com/afpd/">AeroFly Pro Deluxe</a> - about 7 tr, but there is a free analogue of <a href="http://fms.rcdesign.ru/">FMS</a> <br>  Control equipment - Hitec Optic 6 - 4 500 r. <br>  Whale model - 3,500 p. <br>  Engine - 3 500 r. <br>  Battery - 500 p. <br>  Charger for him - another 500 p. <br>  Servos (4 pieces) - 500 p. / Piece <br>  Receiver - about 500 p. <br>  Quartz for the receiver 300 r (transmitter quartz went along with the transmitter itself). <br>  Candle for the engine 300 p.  (consumable, 2 already burned) <br>  Glow for a candle 600 r. <br>  Fuel (1 gallon - 3.78l) - 1000r. <br>  Fuel pump - about 300 p. <br><br>  It seems everything, although it may have forgotten some little things. <br>  For electric power, the amount is about the same, instead of fuel, only batteries are more expensive and chargers. <br><br>  <b>Current expenses:</b> <br>  Fuel (for 1 departure to fly takes about 700 ml of fuel from me) <br>  The propellers are a consumable material, sometimes they strike the ground when they land and break about 100 rubles per unit, I had to take 2-3 pieces for 4-5 takeoffs with the first one, now I take 2 spare ones with me, sometimes I don‚Äôt even come in handy. <br><br>  <b>Prices for repairs:</b> <br>  So far, it has only been bought once, to restore half of the wing about 600 rubles (balsa + film for coating), while some remained for the future, i.e.  repair is quite inexpensive. <br><br>  If the topic is interesting, then I can tell you a little about what I have yet encountered for my relatively little experience in small aviation, these are: <br>  - 3d aerobatics - performing acrobatically tricks that are impossible on ‚Äúbig‚Äù airplanes, such as ‚Äúhanging‚Äù on a screw - in this I have a purely theoretical + simulator experience, I don't have a 3d model yet. <br>  - FPV - flight per view - flight through the camera (here my humble experience is limited to flying in circles over the city) <br><br>  And finally, another beautiful video with models: <br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/skv0dGE8RzM&amp;xid=17259,15700021,15700186,15700190,15700253,15700256,15700259&amp;usg=ALkJrhh_L6TzmARl1CdlSz261IL-5i8rOA" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/90682/">https://habr.com/ru/post/90682/</a></p>
