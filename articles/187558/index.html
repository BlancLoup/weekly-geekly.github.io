Damn, and I'll check spam.  And for sure - there is, 19 minutes ago it came.  Damn it, I kind of already added this person to the whitelist - why is the letter in spam?  It is necessary to understand, check the rules ... But now there is no time, this is a trifle, the letter is urgent, and you will have to dig into these rules for half an hour, and even admins may have to pull.  No, later‚Ä¶ <br>  And tomorrow a letter from a colleague is again in spam. <br><br>  So, we go to the site ... Damn, the authorization has not been preserved.  Here on all sites saved, but not here.  Why?  Maybe clean your cookies?  Can the old password be preserved?  It is necessary to figure it out ... No, well, now it‚Äôs rummaging in settings, and God forbid, I‚Äôll rub your saved passwords for other services, then.  This is, after all, a trifle, but I have to work ... <br>  And tomorrow again, the annoyance of not saved authorization and a minute to think about the reasons.

      Oh, here is the library that does what I need.  Hmm, in Python, but I need in C ++.  And in C ++ there is none.  Well, I will read the Python code, I will understand the general idea and rewrite it in C ++.  Wow, my editor has no Python code highlighting!  Maybe there is some kind of plugin?  Or search for other editors?  Ah, well, this is a one-time task, I won‚Äôt waste time - now I‚Äôll spend half a day comparing a dozen IDE and code editors in Python, but my task is completely different, I‚Äôm spat, it's a trifle ... <br>  And tomorrow, an update comes to the library in Python and you have to read it again. <br><br>  Why not stop suffering on trifles? <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br><h4>  Second time rule </h4><br>  If the annoying trifle happened to you for the first time - this is an annoying trifle.  You will forget about her in a minute, she no longer affects your life.  If the annoying trifle happened to you a second time - this means that your work process somewhere is built incorrectly.  From this point on, you will be annoyed that you have not dealt with the trifle last time, there is a fear that the trifle will hinder you again (and it most likely will really hurt).  In your life there is another task that puts pressure on your shoulders, distracts your thoughts, interferes.  The second occurrence of a minor problem is the moment when it is necessary to begin to deal with it. <br><br><h4>  Two minutes rule </h4><br>  The well-known rule of GTD - if you are 100% sure that the problem can be solved in no more than 2 minutes - do it right now.  Even if there are more urgent matters, even if the task is a trifle, even if it can be done later.  Even once you postpone this task will cost you more - you need to remember / write it down, then remember, and most likely it will remind you of yourself at the most inopportune moment, nerves again, again the decision what to do - damn it all!  Less than two minutes - doing now. <br><br><h4>  The rule of two little things a day </h4><br>  No need to throw all their main tasks and rush to the embrasure of the fight with trifles.  You do not pay for it, it is not what you strive for in life.  If the trifle was not solved within the framework of the ‚Äútwo minutes rule‚Äù - you just need to remember it.  I add it to a special folder in my task scheduler.  You can send a letter to your email or set a reminder. <br><br>  Further from time to time, a situation arises when the head already refuses to work on the main working task, and instead of working on the site of jokes / news / kittens, conscience does not allow to climb.  Personally, I have this happen steadily every day, somewhere around 18:00.  It's time to admit that nothing sensible about the work can be done and you can spend 20 minutes fighting the annoying little things from the ‚Äúspecial folder‚Äù. <br><br>  It turns out that your colleague came under some kind of blacklist in the mail filter and getting it out of there is a trifling matter.  The issue with authorization is really solved simply by cleaning the cookies.  The plugin for Python for the editor used is just one - free and completely normal.  Trivia - for that matter, to be solved in a couple of minutes.  There are many, but do not try to solve them all at once.  Two pieces a day is quite enough.  It will take 15-20 minutes, the conscience will put up with the argument ‚Äúso, that's enough, work enough for today - it's time to go home,‚Äù and life will be a little bit easier. <br><br><h4>  And at this moment happiness comes! </h4><br>  At first it seems that two little things a day are not enough.  But after a day, you already have a spell check in your favorite editor and have made some automatic backup of some data.  Another week - and now your email client already resembles a combat robot, being filled to the brim with rules, filters, signatures, connected by an antivirus and the correct antispam.  A month at this pace - and you are not afraid of losing a laptop (all data is encrypted and duplicated in the cloud), advertising in the browser does not irritate (cut by the plugin), the necessary files are in the blink of an eye due to a properly organized file system, reminders of important events occur just when you need it, the installed viewer is in a rare format for the file, etc. <br><br>  Once again, having found something exactly where I was looking for, having done in 1 click a job that took 5 minutes earlier, having had time to finish the job on time because there was no rake along the way - you are absorbed by a sense of gratitude to yourself, you remember that then one of those little things that you decide and think: ‚ÄúHow cool that because of this you will never have to be nervous anymore!‚Äù. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/187558/">https://habr.com/ru/post/187558/</a></p>
