Or again about starpe ... oh startups :) <br><br>  He quit in the middle of June 2007 from one Omsk company, after a year of work in offices: 3 weeks in one, 3 months in another, and a record 6 months in the last.  With 100,000 rubles on hand, of which 30,000 rubles.  I spent on a used laptop for normal work, I was lost in thoughts about the next project.  I had the experience of my own projects - during my studies I made several sites on php, but nothing special came of it.  The idea came spontaneously, not differing in originality, I wanted to make a freelance exchange (while doing small projects in php and perl, I often worked as a freelance student).  Gradually, the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãa freelance exchange grew into a bigger one, asking myself: ‚Äúwhy not add chat, it would be cool, especially since I never did chat,‚Äù something like this was developed in new sections. <br><br>  On the free-lance.ru resource, 300 people who had more or less normal jobs in the portfolio for creating design prospamil.  The proposal was present only a percentage of the project profits, but most of the responses offered services for money.  Catherine Soah (soaha) agreed with my conditions.  It turned out to be more difficult with the layout, no one agreed to help, so he allocated a little money for the layout, but the miser pays twice, so he reworked the CSS styles.

      From the first line of the code, to what is now, a year has passed.  Basically, apart from design assistance, I worked on the project alone.  Sometimes there were long breaks, when everything was nauseous, sometimes part-time work, because  the initial amount was not enough.  In contrast to the year of office experiments, for the year of independent work he received a tremendous experience in programming.  Possibly developed a system based on Tapestry5 and Hibernate, the level of Django or RubyOnRails, later I think to do documenting and posting it in open source. <br><br>  Drawing conclusions from the past two years, I highly recommend not thinking, we‚Äôll learn, to work remotely, to work out some wretched system or in a provincial company, again to support regular poor systems, if you are a student programmer right now take on your own projects.  Making a small project on the right books on your own is the first step towards understanding and developing complex systems.  And you can always discuss or learn new things from blogs, forums or programmers' portals - this is all real in the Internet age. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/27848/">https://habr.com/ru/post/27848/</a></p>
