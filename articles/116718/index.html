For each book, I prepared a squeeze of ideas - sammari, which I will bring to your attention. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  An interesting book by Sir <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ken_Robinson_(British_author)">Ken Robinson</a> , the founder of my favorite <a href="http://www.ted.com/">TED</a> conference and in general one of the greatest enlighteners of the new time. <br> <a href=""><img title="Vocation" src="http://ctrl-c-writer.ru/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/.jpg" width="283" height="340"></a> <br>  I liked the format of the book - it is rather small both physically and meaningfully.  Recently, I have often thought about reading books, and came to the conclusion that short, small books are still an advantage.  It seems to me that when reading a large book, a syndrome of prolonged reading may develop - interest in the process begins to fade.  A short book, on the contrary, reads quickly and is understood better.  Of course, all this does not apply to fiction.

      So, as Sir Robinson‚Äôs book says: <br><ul><li>  The modern education system works on the principle of fast food, where compliance with standards comes to the first role (this, by the way, <a href="http://ctrl-c-writer.ru/linchpin-summary/">was written</a> in ‚ÄúIrreplaceable‚Äù).  The system is outdated since the era of industrialization, when it was invented.  We need a school - "restaurant". </li><li>  In modern school, all subjects are taught in isolation from each other and from the existing reality, as a result, they are poorly absorbed.  In pursuit of a fictional performance, disciplines such as, for example, artistic craft or music are reduced. </li><li>  The Internet and computer technologies have buried the school where our children study - they can independently learn in an hour what the school doesn‚Äôt teach in a whole day. </li><li>  The greatest danger of the school, like any other system, is that it does not allow the vocation, which is in every person, to develop. </li><li>  Calling is the point of contact between natural abilities and personal preferences.  Vocation has two main features - ability and passion. </li><li>  When both signs are realized, the conditions for the realization of a harmonious and successful life of a person - attitude and possibility - come to the fore. </li><li>  ‚ÄúI have it‚Äù - ‚ÄúI love it‚Äù - ‚ÄúI want it‚Äù - ‚ÄúWhere can I find it?‚Äù </li><li>  You need to be able to share the desire to do something and the vocation itself.  For example, if you dream of playing the piano, it's just a desire to play it (you think it would be cool to play the piano).  If you had a vocation, then you would have played the keys long ago. </li><li>  Intellect tests do not measure intelligence itself, but only speak of a person‚Äôs ability to solve these tests.  IQ is incredibly biased, forget about it.  Also, forget about psychological personality types - there are at least six billion in the world. </li><li>  Creativity is the driving force of man and the key to gaining vocation.  Follow the creativity, light it your way. </li><li>  Keep an eye on other people and help them find their creative side, suggest, teach.  Especially look at the children - one of your right movement can help reveal the genius. </li><li>  Find your tribe - people who share the same views with you.  The tribe will become the catalyst of your vocation.  A tribe consists of a field (the environment in which people develop) and the players - the people themselves.  Form a field and look for players! </li><li>  The obstacles to gaining a vocation are pressure circles: personal, social and cultural.  "What will others think of me?" Methods of dealing with pressure: the constant search for new creative solutions, the firmness in maintaining their views, or a change in the environment (or tribe). </li><li>  Luckiness is not a property of a person, but his view of things and a situation.  The optimist is lucky, the pessimist is not.  You will also be helped by reframing - the ability to search for positive emotions in a situation that unfolds contrary to expectations and plans. </li><li>  In the search for vocation, the role of a mentor or mentor is important.  Look for him in your tribe, or be a mentor to other people.  Mentoring develops both the student and the teacher himself. </li><li>  In searching for Calling, age does not matter.  Just forget about the time. </li><li>  And forget about the money.  A vocation may not bring you money and glory, but it will surely give you the greatest pleasure, joy and happiness. </li><li>  Education, money, age - all this does not matter.  It is important to look for your vocation, because it is the key to happiness.  If you search for it, you will definitely find it. </li></ul><br>  Book Grade: 7.5 / 10 <br><br>  <strong>Martin Seligman "In search of happiness."</strong> <br> <a href=""><img title="photo" src="http://ctrl-c-writer.ru/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/photo.jpg" width="305" height="340"></a> <br><br>  The book, as its name implies, is devoted to the study of the phenomenon of happiness, but this phenomenon is investigated from the point of view of positive psychology - a completely scientific approach.  So what does the book tell us? <br><ul><li>  According to statistics, optimists and positive-minded people live longer and suffer less.  Cheerful people remember more pleasant events and more easily forget unpleasant, depressive people fix both that and the other equally. </li><li>  Melancholic and pessimists perceive reality objectively, without becoming happier. </li><li>  Optimism is not an inherent property, but an entirely attainable state. </li><li>  A positive-minded person is able to do more and is distinguished by increased diligence. </li><li>  The level of happiness does not depend on material well-being, income, age, education, gender, climate, or religion. </li><li>  Positive properties can be associated with the past, present and future.  Satisfaction, sense of accomplishment, pride, calmness are connected with the past, joy, delight, calmness, enthusiasm, excitement, love of life with the present.  To the future include optimism, hope, self-confidence, faith.  All these feelings can be customized and strengthened, thereby increasing the level of happiness. </li><li>  In order to feel happiness in the past, you need to be able to let go of your anger, forgive, forget the insults, give thanks for the good. </li><li>  Pessimism in the present is easy to beat.  The first way is to refute his arguments, entering into a mental argument with him.  The second is to come up with an alternative explanation for failure.  The third is to arrange an objective analysis of future consequences.  It is easy to notice that in reality everything is always not as scary as it seems. </li><li>  Happiness in the present consists of pleasure and spiritual satisfaction.  Pleasures are ‚Äúinferior‚Äù, bodily pleasures, which, however, cannot be neglected.  A great way to increase pleasure is to learn to savor the sensations, enjoying them in small doses. </li><li>  It is necessary to learn how to preserve and record memories - these are concentrated pleasures. </li><li>  Pleasure does not bring spiritual satisfaction.  Spiritual satisfaction bring doing your favorite thing, work, passion.  The greatest spiritual satisfaction is achieved in a state of flow. </li><li>  Character is the sum of six virtues: wisdom, courage, love, justice, moderation, and spirituality. </li><li>  Character is subject to change and improvement, the key to which is constant strengthening and improvement in virtues. </li><li>  The pleasure of working depends on a passion that can be motivated and developed. </li><li>  A great way of motivation is competitiveness at work, as well as deep interaction (when everyone does a common job together). </li><li>  Love is one of the strongest components of happiness.  There are three types (or styles) of love - calm, avoiding and restless.  Peaceful love - measured, based on respect and feelings.  Avoiding - a bit distant and colder, and restless - bright, controversial and passionate.  Peaceful love brings more happiness. </li><li>  The components of happiness in family life: the ability to listen to a partner, morning and evening ‚Äúfive minutes‚Äù discussions of plans and results, regular shakes of feelings (small adventures), joint activities. </li><li>  Happiness in general lies not in constant pleasure, but in the accumulation of capital of spiritual satisfaction through work, hobbies, love.  Happiness is the realization of its merits. </li></ul><br>  Book Grade: 7/10 <br><br>  <em>Sammari on three other books can be read</em> <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/books/112750/"><em>in the previous topic</em></a> <em>.</em>  <em>If you do not like the word "sammari", then you can offer your own version in the comments to that topic.</em> <br><br>  <em>I will be glad to hear your suggestions for new books and an opinion about what I read.</em> <br><br></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/116718/">https://habr.com/ru/post/116718/</a></p>
