      But it is not as easy as it seems.  It needs to learn for months.  Some strategy may not work right away, but take off in a week.  But now I will tell you some simple ways to promote your blog. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h4>  Before posting </h4><br>  This is the most important step for the viral promotion of the post.  Here you create an information dissemination strategy. <br><br><h5>  1. Create a list of people who will repost your post, and build relationships with them </h5><br>  They can be called "influential persona."  These could be celebrities, business sharks, government officials, industry experts, or public figures.  They can attract a huge amount of traffic by sharing your post once. <br><br>  You need to make a list of these influential people and make a letter template to them.  This is not an attempt to sell - it is an attempt to make friends.  Write how you admire their work, but do not overdo it.  Do not attack them with messages, wait a few days after the first letter. <br><br>  Learn about their interests and try to get their attention with these topics.  Soon you will become something meaningful to them and you will get into their field of vision.  Mention them in tweets, enter into conversations. <br><br>  A good way to find and identify such people is <a href="http://buzzsumo.com/">Buzzsumo</a> .  This is a service for finding popular content and influential people.  A useful feature of the service is to give a <a href="https://app.buzzsumo.com/influencers">list of influential personalities</a> for a keyword.  You can also get a list of those who share a specific entry - they, too, need to be a friend. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/megamozg/post_images/076/210/595/076210595dc4af38df17ed7d0c812f66.png" alt="image"><br><br>  The picture shows a list of influential personalities with the keywords ‚ÄúContent Marketing‚Äù.  Sorted by match.  Under the names - links to their blogs and names on Twitter.  Convenience! <br><br><h5>  2. Create copies for all social networks and platforms </h5><br>  To attract initial attention, it will be necessary to share material on all social media.  Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Instagram, Pinterest, and others. <br><br><h5>  3. Start talking about it!  Drive a wave. </h5><br>  You need to start an advertising campaign so that people around you know that something is coming and that they have to wait for it.  Make them want to get this information before you give it out.  If your project is quite extravagant, you can even remove the trailer.  But usually a couple of tweets will be enough.  We must splurge everyone to follow you. <br><br><h4>  Publication </h4><br>  At this stage, everything happens, good or bad.  There is no need to sit and wait - here you need to implement your strategy.  Everything is planned well, but everything must be done even better. <br><br><h5>  4. Post information on all social sites. </h5><br>  Right on the list.  Do not forget, if necessary, to edit the record, depending on the specifics of the social network.  In some groups, the blog will work, in some - fail.  The main thing is to try to maintain and establish new connections in social networks. <br><br>  If your main platform is LinkedIn, you should try to get into the <a href="http://topdogsocialmedia.com/how-to-become-linkedin-top-contributor/">Top Contributor</a> .  They have many advantages and many followers.  Usually among them there are industry leaders - a good company.  Build a relationship! <br><br><h5>  5. Take advantage of blog aggregators, link collections and blog syndicators. </h5><br>  <a href="http://www.bloggingtips.com/2014/04/04/top-6-content-aggregating-sites/">Aggregators</a> - sites that collect content from the Internet, either by relevance or popularity. <br><br>  Collections of links akin to social media platforms.  The difference is that they share content across communities.  Examples: StumbleUpon, Reddit, Digg and Scoop.it.  These are very useful sites.  For starters, you can enter there with a couple of useful links, and then start self-promotion.  In addition to these sites there are <a href="http://www.ebizmba.com/articles/social-bookmarking-websites">many others</a> , do not be lazy to look for them! <br><br>  <a href="http://weblogs.about.com/od/marketingablog/tp/BlogSyndication.htm">Syndicators</a> are sites where bloggers reprint their content.  They add fame and traffic to blogs.  One of the most famous such projects is <a href="https://medium.com/">Medium</a> .  This is one of my favorite sites and is very easy to use. <br><br><h5>  6. Talk and communicate with influential personalities. </h5><br>  Contact influential friends and share your posts with them.  If any of them share your content, it will attract very serious traffic to the blog. <br><br>  After publication <br><br>  No, we haven't finished yet. <br><br>  The best time to promote content is when you already know who liked it.  Follow the statistics, analyze the market.  You can get a serious advantage from such market research. <br><br><h5>  7 Don't let the fire go out - advertise again. </h5><br>  Re-advertising is the most important part of blogging.  Many people just forget about it.  But this is a very important step, because you have not yet reached everyone from your entire potential audience.  So far you have only touched the tip of the iceberg. <br><br>  You need to go back to the beginning and again write copies of materials for all social networks.  Connect with influential people again.  Advertising and more advertising. <br><br><h5>  8 Do not forget the keywords </h5><br>  Keywords are the key to creating organic traffic, and depending on the type of content, it can be turned from organic into evergreen.  Your content can become viral even months after publication. <br><br><h4>  Other useful materials: </h4><br>  <a href="https://blog.kissmetrics.com/17-advanced-methods/">blog.kissmetrics.com/17-advanced-methods</a> <br><br>  <a href="http://www.robbierichards.com/seo/16-explosive-content-promotion-strategies/">www.robbierichards.com/seo/16-explosive-content-promotion-strategies</a> <br><br>  <a href="http://writtent.com/blog/content-promotion-strategy-23-proven-ways-to-explode-website-traffic/">writtent.com/blog/content-promotion-strategy-23-proven-ways-to-explode-website-traffic</a> <br><br>  <a href="http://www.growthpulse.com/3-legit-content-promotion-strategies/">www.growthpulse.com/3-legit-content-promotion-strategies</a> <br><br>  <a href="http://sujanpatel.com/content-marketing/50-promotion-tactics-include-content-marketing-strategy/">sujanpatel.com/content-marketing/50-promotion-tactics-include-content-marketing-strategy</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/286772/">https://habr.com/ru/post/286772/</a></p>
