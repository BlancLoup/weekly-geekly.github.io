It would seem that nothing unusual and beyond the difficult task of making an icon is not.  But it is she who will distinguish your application from the crowd of their own kind.  After interviewing a number of developers on icon design, we have compiled TOP 5 tips for their truly effective design. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a>

      Tip 1: Analyze the App Store <br><br>  When you design an icon, remember that you must be honest, first of all, with the buyer.  The icon may attract attention, but vary with the content of the application itself.  The icon should reflect the essence of your development and show its functional differences.  Look at the applications with which icons are sold better in the App Store and take these conclusions into service. <br><br>  Tip 2: Pay attention to the quality of the icon <br><br>  Keep in mind that all potential buyers can see the application icon.  And partly thanks to him, the client must decide whether or not to buy your product.  Seeing a badly done icon, the client may decide that you assume a poorly designed application.  Nicholas Thomsen, the head of Apporacle.com, says in this connection: ‚ÄúThe inefficient and ugly icon says that the developer has spent two minutes on it and gives the impression of the poor quality of the application, even before you open it.‚Äù <br><br>  Tip 3: Be Different <br><br>  Follow the trends in the App Store icons.  There are a number of colors that are used more often than others.  For example, the colors of the sky, stands out from the rest.  Also, most icons have shaded edges.  The tendencies of icons, like all tendencies in the world, have properties to change.  Be aware of all these changes.  But be careful.  Remember that the best is chosen in return for good.  And if everyone follows the same tendency, then this only leads to depersonalization and the creation of a gray mass. <br><br>  Tip 4: Pay attention to the little things <br><br>  The application icon may not seem like such a significant thing.  When dealing with a 57x57 pixel image, it‚Äôs easy to overlook certain things, such as gradients and blackouts.  And this is a big mistake.  This is what freshapps.com says about it: <br><br>  ‚ÄúYou may not know what the application is about, but the icon will already characterize it.  If you notice that creating an icon took a lot of time and effort of the author.  If you can see that all the little things are thought out and made in haste, then it can only say that the developer makes the product worth your time. ‚Äù <br><br>  Tip 5: Seek professional help <br><br>  So, you have created an application for the iPhone.  Do not waste days, weeks or months of work by developing non-effective icons and wasting time.  Very rarely among the developers there are also graphic artists.  Often, a good designer will take not a lot of money to develop an elementary, in his opinion, icon, but this ‚Äúelementary‚Äù icon can bring you a huge amount of downloads and take you to the top Apps Store. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/79198/">https://habr.com/ru/post/79198/</a></p>
