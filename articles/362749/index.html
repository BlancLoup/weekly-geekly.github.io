  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Supernotebooks for tire sellers: why did Lenovo ThinkPad computers choose Pirelli in Moscow?</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Even if you are far from cars, you probably heard about Pirelli tires.  The Italian company, founded in 1872, today is one of the world's largest tire manufacturers, not least because of Formula 1, the company‚Äôs exclusive rubber supplier since 2011. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/1f6/2a7/050/1f62a70500404eaebef53dc7a00c363b.jpg"><br><br>  What you hardly heard - that the staff of the Russian branch of Pirelli has been using Lenovo ThinkPad equipment for many years.  Especially for this post, Pirelli employees were asked to share their thoughts on using the ThinkPad in their daily work. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h4>  Choosing Lenovo </h4><br>  Work in Pirelli is very dynamic in the literal sense of the word: employees of the company are often on the road - not only on tire tests, but also on ordinary business occasions such as meetings with partners in the regions.  This implies special requirements for work computers: this is not a greenhouse office mode of operation, but a 100% load on the laptop.  Therefore, parameters such as weight, battery, reliability in harsh operating conditions and speed - become critical.

      Pirelli is no stranger to harsh operating conditions.  ThinkPad'am too: the material from which the case of the ThinkPad notebooks is created is also used in aviation and in Formula 1 racing. <br><br>  That's right, adding to the list of requirements price, Pirelli formulated the criteria for selecting laptops for employees of the Russian division of the company. <br><br>  <b>Fact:</b> laptops were tested both in the Russian office and in Milan. <br><br>  Speaking of reliability.  See what tests Lenovo ThinkPad survived without much damage to its performance: <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/paO6QfOitU4%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700022,15700186,15700191,15700248,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhgepkr25c9erGLOlQ-9w6DQ3rsh-A" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  I myself, as the owner of one of the ThinkPads, were very pleased to watch.  What you need for a laptop that can be taken on business trips.  Not surprisingly, in Pirelli eventually settled on this line.  Thus began the long-term partnership of Lenovo and Pirelli in Russia. <br><br><h4>  Integrate it </h4><br>  Big purchases in big companies are always a big job.  Pirelli buyers, with the participation of representatives met with Lenovo in Moscow.  Pirelli has its own standards for software: depending on the nature of the employee‚Äôs work, this may be normal working software or specialized programs.  All these points are tested and verified during the certification process. <br><br>  An important role in establishing contact was played by the system integrator - IBS Datafort.  Large companies rarely buy equipment directly, because  along with the selection of equipment is the question of its replacement and maintenance.  It is more convenient to give to a third party.  This is what the system integrator does.  All Lenovo equipment comes with a service package: customer service, an employee‚Äôs visit to the office, and replacement equipment for the repair period. <br><br><h4>  Large family </h4><br>  Over the years of cooperation, Pirelli has created its own Lenovo fleet of vehicles, starting with those models that have already been withdrawn from sales, but still serve the business objectives of the company in Russia.  As a result, in the Moscow office of Pirelli today work: <br><br><ul><li>  desktops Lenovo m71e and Lenovo m90p </li><li>  a whole family of laptops: Lenovo ThinkPad T420, Lenovo ThinkPad X200s and Lenovo ThinkPad X201, six Lenovo ThinkPad X201i, four Lenovo ThinkPad X230, twenty Lenovo ThinkPad X240 (one of which is used by Pirelli CEO in Russia).  And the main workhorse is the Lenovo ThinkPad X220, of which 46 pieces work in Moscow‚Äôs Pirelli. </li></ul><br><h4>  Word to user </h4><br>  Returning to the user survey, which I mentioned at the beginning of the post.  In response to a request from Pirelli employees to share their experience with Lenovo technology, we received a lot of feedback.  The battery life, weight, performance and compactness of ThinkPads were especially often noted. <br><br>  Complaints received during the survey (the most interesting part of any survey) - deterioration of the laptop (for example, battery life on average after two years of operation) or hard disk failure after several drops (tested on models X201 and X201i), by and large ThinkPad praise On the other hand: battery wear is an inevitable process, and two years of durability are more than a decent time.  And about how hard hard drives to survive the fall, and you should not say :) <br><br>  <b>Fact:</b> employees working ‚Äúin the field‚Äù often take with them a spare battery or a battery of increased power. <br><br>  As I was told in Pirelli, users who used Lenovo often refused to offer newer Dell or HP laptops, which are also popular in the corporate segment, offered to replace, asking to keep Lenovo - replacing, for example, the model with a newer one.  What and you want. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/362749/">https://habr.com/ru/post/362749/</a></p>
