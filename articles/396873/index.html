DOOGEE T5 Announcement</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  What does a typical iPhone killer look like?  Apple's form, the quality of materials is so-so, on board Android with a non-standard shell or without it, several killer features (in fact, not a killer).  All the murder is built on the <s>type of Labuthenah</s> "type iPhone".  Boring  It is much more interesting to look at the impudent murder of something non-standard, not so familiar as the iPhone or Samsung.  For example, did Vertu kill? <br><br> <a href="https://geektimes.ru/company/jd/blog/279466/"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/5ec/b52/d7e/5ecb52d7e6594dc9b3fdb6207f1a4762.png"></a> <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  The DOOGEE brand as a manufacturer of smartphones and wearable electronics appeared on the Chinese market in 2013, although KVD itself has been operating since 2002 and knows for sure how to use mobile devices.  KVD produced OEM products (original equipment manufacturer) for well-known manufacturers of smartphones.  Such participation in the chain of division of labor has led to the presence of research laboratories and full-cycle factories that can supply all the components of mobile devices: from electronic filling to touch panels.  It‚Äôs a sin not to take advantage of this success by adding to it the mobile boom in China and the possibility of entering the international market through the largest Chinese retailers. <br><br>  This is how the DOOGEE brand appeared, which, as is usually the case in China, included a ton of meaning: D (do) is the English-language ‚Äúdo‚Äù recognized and loved by brands, OO is the symbol of infinity ‚àû, GEE is the American-English analogue of ‚ÄúWow! "," Wow! "," God! ".  In general, the application for the WOW effect.  And this effect is: almost every month DOOGEE offers a new model: some ultra-thin design models made of glass and metal, some harsh protected smartphones, some very simple options, some high-performance flagships.  And the main thing that unites all smartphones of this brand is the low price for its class.  With this set, you can break into ambitions and even wipe at ...

    <h2>  <font color="#c30023">... killing Vertu</font> </h2><br>  Attempts on Vertu happened more than once.  TAG Heuer was the first to succeed, among others, with their Meridiist and Dior, which released luxury fashion phones that easily competed with luxury Vertu in the minds of potential consumers.  Samsung also did not pass by and in 2008 released the Samsung Ego.  Moreover, the Russian company ‚ÄúStraight‚Äù distinguished itself, which in 2011 began selling through the Euroset a mobile phone under the ‚ÄúQ‚Äù brand for 179,000 rubles apiece (by the way, for fun - the device worked on Symbian S40).  All of these models differed in the use of expensive, in the literal sense of the word, elite materials, but the technical characteristics were average. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/e69/f87/935/e69f87935e376ca494fd8fa043e736b3.png"></div><br>  <font color="#999999"><i><b>the Q</b> from a Russian company - a phone at the price of "Zhiguli"</i></font> <br><br>  The knight's move was made by DOOGEE.  The line was updated time after time, there were interesting solutions that combine excellent design and modern characteristics of smartphones running Android.  That is, the concept is as follows: we focus on a luxurious look, pleasant materials, but at the same time we keep an affordable price.  It turned out smartphones for anyone: for a business person, and for those who are "purely propose".  And now the line has been updated - and, it seems, well. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/a98/084/024/a980840246f358a291c4e703ad91f0cc.jpg"></div><br>  <strong><a href="http://sale.jd.ru/act/MTzBAVq7fe.html">Doogee T5</a></strong> is a novelty, which is positioned as a smartphone for business, namely as one of the models of the Doogee TT business line of smartphones (Yes, what they do with references to legends! Audi TT, stop torturing the brain).  The smartphone itself is almost entirely made of aluminum with leather inserts (have you already found out?), It has protection against water, dust, and blows due to the rubberized case (protection class IP67).  Actually, from this moment thoughts about the Audi TT end and new ones come - about SUVs.  This turned out and Doogee T5 - reliable, powerful, safe and prestigious.  Depending on the situation, the user will be able to change the shell: business style to sporty.  In addition to the smartphone, two cases will be delivered: under the skin of a crocodile and in a sporty style.  Even with a quick glance at the device, there is a persistent feeling that the latest Vertu models were a source of inspiration for designers. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/cd9/f21/daa/cd9f21daa167b2b25eaef1e2a2ee10be.jpg"></div><br><h2>  <font color="#c30023">What's inside?</font> </h2><br>  The electronic filling of the device is also quite good.  However, there is a persistent feeling that the smartphone is positioned precisely on the male audience.  Judge for yourself: why does a man have a front camera for selfie?  Let it be 5 Mp.  But the main one is very worthy: 13 Mp, with phase autofocus (PDAF).  Such, as a rule, work well even in poor light. <br><br>  Screen 5 inches with HD-resolution, already familiar shovel.  The smartphone supports 2 SIM cards.  The processor is an eight-core MT6753 Octa Core, 3 GB of RAM and 32 GB of internal memory (it is possible to expand by another 32 GB using microSD).  These indicators are excellent for work and even good pulling the game.  And to play, in case of waiting or a short rest, you can safely: the 4500 mAh battery will not fail.  In the standard mode of use it is 2-3 days, 20 hours of continuous talk or 725 hours in standby mode.  Well, yes, if someone doubts, the phone works in LTE. <br><br>  <b><a href="http://sale.jd.ru/act/MTzBAVq7fe.html">Performance characteristics</a> for the lazy:</b> <br><blockquote>  <strong>Weight:</strong> 159 grams <br>  <strong>Display:</strong> 5 inches, 1280 x 720 Px <br>  <strong>Chipset:</strong> Qualcomm Adreno <br>  <strong>Processor:</strong> MT6753 <br>  <strong>CPU:</strong> 2.0Ghz Octa Core 64-bit CPU <br>  <strong>GPU:</strong> Qualcomm Adreno 530 GPU <br>  <strong>RAM:</strong> 3 GB DDR3 933MHz <br>  <strong>ROM:</strong> 32 GB <br>  <strong>Expandable memory:</strong> Micro SD card (T-FLASH card), max 32GB <br>  <strong>Operating system:</strong> Android 6.0 Marshmallow Operating System <br>  <strong>USB:</strong> microUSB 2.0 with OTG support (can charge other devices) <br>  <strong>NFC:</strong> does not support <br>  <strong>Work in networks:</strong> 2G, 3G, 4G LTE (Downstream: 150Mbps; Upstream: 50Mbps) <br>  <strong>Wi-Fi:</strong> Wi-Fi 802.11 b / g / n, Support Hotspot <br>  <strong>SIM cards:</strong> supports dual sim dual standby, dual sim Ôºå micro sim <br>  <strong>Battery:</strong> 4500 mAh </blockquote><br>  And the most pleasant thing - in the presale period (August 15-25, 2016) a coupon discount of $ 24.99 will be distributed.  The starting price of the <strong><a href="http://sale.jd.ru/act/MTzBAVq7fe.html">smartphone</a></strong> will be $ 229.99.  The main sales period will last from August 26 to September 15. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/3a7/777/4e2/3a77774e2e88fc43b622f7b73faf72ec.png"></div><br>  Today you can pre-order <a href="http://sale.jd.ru/act/MTzBAVq7fe.html">DOOGEE T5</a> .  By the way, the smartphone is launched in the JD Collection (retail-direction JD.ru), and this is always an increased guarantee of service. <br><br>  Traditionally, our VKontakte group will not be overlooked, in which during the presale the competition will be held: Doogee T5 will be the prize for every 100th, 200th, 300th and 400th client who has issued a pre-order. <br><br>  DOOGEE T5 turned out not like everyone else - it is not the usual black glossy rectangle, not zakos pink gold, not a glass wonder.  In any case, the smartphone will attract attention, at least with the expected question, whether the brand is in the hands of the owner.  For an Android smartphone, this is a bold and conspicuous decision - one that a young player should offer.  DOOGEE has experience filling the line of business smartphones, and from TT you can expect only pleasant surprises.  The guys found a niche, found a target audience, created a good, strong product.  At the site of other manufacturers, it‚Äôs time to get nervous, this is a very sudden player.  And who knows what will happen next. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/396873/">https://habr.com/ru/post/396873/</a></p>
