Mainly in Europe and America.  It does not drive a car and suffers from aerophobia.  Do you understand what I am getting at?  The range of possibilities has already narrowed considerably.  He is also not particularly honored with trains - he says that a regular intercity bus is cheaper and the impressions are completely different.  Again, its advantages in choosing the place of the main pastime - I liked the city, stayed longer in it, not very - quickly got off.  Lovers of trains may of course argue, but <s>everyone satisfies himself in accordance with his preferences,</s> as you like. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/685/f16/029/685f1602905e46e581251065361d3ed3.jpg"><br><br>  But as for the buses, then he ate the dog, and perhaps not one.  Cities in Europe and the United States, in which his foot has not stepped, without exaggeration, can be counted on the fingers.  Perhaps only he knows at which gas stations on the route with Moscow-Amsterdam transfers toilets with a shower, or where it is cheaper to eat on the way from Budapest to Barcelona.  Information is possible and far from general use, but impressive. <a name="habracut"></a>

      But this is the preamble.  One day we had a dispute with him on the subject that in the same way one can travel along the endless Russian expanses.  Almost the same comfort and the ability to quickly find online routes for transplantation.  I took the pro-Russian position, not being a special expert on this (I‚Äôm just a patriot and I believe that everything is no worse than ours), but he flatly refused to agree with me, and no longer because of the degree of comfort on the way (‚ÄúBelieve I was not cussed by the toilet than at the bus station in Warsaw, I did not meet in remote Siberia ‚Äù), but because of the impossibility without delays, hustling in queues, or waiting for the opening of the ticket office of the provincial bus station. <br><br>  <i>-How so?</i>  - I cried, being offended by doubts about the advancement of the Motherland in this aspect, - There are a <i>lot of such sites on the Internet, even we have it on the platform, one of them is looking for funding.</i> <br><br>  <i>-Well, he can and is looking for, but there is no ready solution, I tell you.</i>  <i>Once it is complete, find an intelligent one so that tickets for Russia and the CIS to all destinations can be bought</i> - he was as calm as a boa. <br><br>  They argued on a box of Czech beer (he leaves for Prague, and at the same time brings a loss), and, anticipating an easy victory, I went to look.  The market of online services in any particular area to analyze (well, so I imagine it) today is quite simple.  To do this, it is enough to open the links of the first two pages of the issue of Google or Yandex, and those who like to compare them (like me) - both of them, register on all found sites and try to perform a single operation.  So I did. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/a86/5a0/ce9/a865a0ce977a4eada929663641634588.jpg"><br><br>  The selection stage of the results of the presentation was great - 26 tabs crowded in my browser, making it difficult for each other to open, and in the mouth you could clearly feel the taste of excellent Czech beer.  But then it went tight: it turned out that more or less functional players in this market are either in .UA or .BY, and they sell tickets mainly in their own republics, while the Russian search engines for long-distance bus tickets and booking services are sinful with localities ‚Äî tied to your region and a narrow range of coverage.  In addition, most of these sites, it turns out, simply provides information about flights, only a few allow you to book tickets and very few offer the possibility of purchasing them online with a credit card.  Another noteworthy was the weak technical implementation of most of them - the sites were clearly made by artisans if not in the 20th century, then probably at the very beginning of the 21st.  Moreover, many of them simply did not work, as expected, giving out errors or hanging for half an hour while searching for a flight.  There is no need to speak about the presence of a mobile application in any of them.  In general, everything is clear.  The bitterness of defeat quickly changed the taste of victory - I lost and it can not be denied.  Although, what if ... (I remembered a similar service with us on VCStart) push it as a contender for victory? <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/04b/26e/ff7/04b26eff72504d4eb69ca48ea91dc97f.jpg"><br><br>  Opened the site Indabus (the so-called this project), being very skeptical.  But surprisingly, but I was pleased with the service from the first steps.  First of all, I did not see that designer archaism here, the fruits of which had just been shoveled over the mountains, trying to buy a ticket from point A to absolutely point B, which seemed to be close to it, and breaking off, either without finding the functions of purchase and payment, or not finding flights to the most popular destinations. <br><br>  Distinct and fairly modern design sets a positive, and then read on the site of the service any informative information about the cities-directions - immediately pulled to travel.  Further more.  The mechanism for acquiring electronic tickets is standard.  Like the airline ticket purchase services, we enter the passenger's name, passport data, pay, print the electronic ticket. The search works as it should, and most importantly - quickly, but most of all was pleased with the variety of payment methods (there are VM and POH). <br><br>  Of course, I won‚Äôt win with him, but it‚Äôs a pity that the service is good, but still very young, and the coverage of the areas is too small (although the global preference is felt, unlike its counterparts).  Therefore, it is time to go to the station - to hold a friend, admit defeat, and ask for a beer on the way back to seize on return. <br><br>  But I was interested in the service, while I was driving in the subway, I fully immersed myself in studying it.  And with each station, he became more and more sympathetic to me - Indabus started a very useful business, as it turned out. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/iNbGs9UfMyg&amp;xid=25657,15700023,15700186,15700190,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhg_3-vNEFlJlubd9SIW57zZu-Aphw" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  The main goal of INDABUS.RU set itself just the departure from what strained me most in its many competitors - local isolation.  Indabus, on the contrary, creates a common online space that allows you to quickly and conveniently purchase an electronic bus ticket to anywhere in the Russian Federation.  That is, the main task of the service is to collect Russian lands by creating a single bus infrastructure.  I also liked the sight of a Western tourist, expressed in the English version of the site - foreigners love to travel by bus.  In addition, the functionality of the service itself inspires confidence, and the design is not bad.  In a word, everything is good - everything would still work as it should and the guys should be seriously engaged in promoting on the Internet.  And in the afternoon with fire they will not be found.  And over the expansion of geography must somehow thoroughly work.  And then here from Krasnodar, for example, there is absolutely no place to go, and on the Stavropol Territory - on the contrary, there are flights to every location. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/c5d/2cc/df0/c5d2ccdf0b494e6b88809a22974b1bb9.jpg"><br><br>  It is precisely on promotion on the Internet (and also on technical improvements and integration with carriers) that a startup plans to spend the funds received as a result of a round of financing on our collective investment platform VCStart.  In exchange, Indabus is ready to give investors a share of 5 to 10% and 3% of the required amount has already been collected.  There are only six investors so far (but it‚Äôs the beginning) and one of them is my friend who has already managed to return from wandering. <br><br>  <i>‚ÄúA really good project,‚Äù</i> he boosted happily during the joint destruction of my loss, taking a huge sip of Budweiser (on my hard-earned Budweiser, by the way), <i>turned out to be twice as useful)))</i> <br><br>  And you know, there is no reason not to believe him.  Share in the startup Indabus (and in any of the 45 currently represented) on the collective investment platform VCStart.com you can buy.  Risk is a noble cause, and venture investments in start-ups are doubly noble. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/237967/">https://habr.com/ru/post/237967/</a></p>
