Over time, we plan to make such competitions weekly, but this one will last 8 weeks, coinciding with school holidays in the northern hemisphere. <br><br><h5>  Summary: </h5><br><ul><li>  Two age categories: 13 and under, and from 14 to 18. </li><li>  Prizes for the first place in $ 1,000 and for $ 200 for the second places in each of the categories. </li><li>  The goal is simple: we want you to impress the judges with your program you wrote for the Raspberry Pi. </li></ul>

      The goal is simple: we want you to impress the judges with your program you wrote for the Raspberry Pi.  If you don‚Äôt have a Raspberry Pi yet, you can still participate - just use one of the popular platform emulators. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h5>  Detailed conditions: </h5><br>  <b>SPONSOR</b> <br><br>  The sponsor is The Raspberry Pi Foundation, Mitchell Wood House, Caldecote, CB23 7NU, UK. <br><br>  <b>TERMS</b> <br><br>  The 2012 Raspberry Pi Foundation Summer Programming Contest starts on July 7, 2012 at 9:00:00 UK time and ends on September 1, 2012 at 9:00:00 UK time.  By submitting an Application, each Participant (or, if necessary, the Participant‚Äôs parents or guardians) agrees with the official rules presented here and guarantees that his participation in the competition will be complied with in accordance with all the requirements laid down in the official rules.  This is a contest based on skill and chance plays no role in determining the winners. <br><br>  <b>WHO CAN PARTICIPATE</b> <br><br>  The competition is open only to persons who have already turned or have not turned 18 years old at the date of the start of the competition, and who study full-time at this date.

THE COMPETITION IS NULL, IF IT WAS BREACHED. <br><br>  <b>HOW TO PARTICIPATE</b> <br><br>  The goal of the competition is to simply create an application that runs on the Raspberry Pi computer and that impresses the judges.  Each application consists of an application form and an archive file containing all source codes, files and data for applications.  To participate, visit <a href="http://www.raspberrypi.org/">www.raspberrypi.org</a> on August 4, 2012 or later;  fill out the application and submit it with the archive. <br><br>  Categories for participants: (1) 13 years and under, and (2) age from 14 to 18. Participants must specify a category and meet the age requirements for this category on the date of the start of the competition.  There are no restrictions on the number of applications from one participant. <br><br>  The application must be fully developed from the original materials prepared by the Participant, and must not violate the copyrights, moral rights or intellectual property rights of any natural or legal person. <br><br>  <b>AWARDS AND JUDGMENT</b> <br><br>  The winner in each category will receive $ 1000.  Up to five winners in each category will receive $ 200.  The judges will select the winners and prize winners from the Participants at their discretion, the decisions of the judge are final and binding on all issues related to the competition. <br><br>  The Sponsor reserves the right to take such measures as it deems necessary to verify the authenticity and originality of any Application and / or Participant (including the Participant‚Äôs age, identity, address and authorship of the application) and disqualify any Participant who submits an Application that is not according to these official rules. <br><br>  <b>LICENSE</b> <br><br>  By taking part in the competition, all Participants provide an irrevocable, unlimited, royalty-free, worldwide non-exclusive license to the sponsor the opportunity to reproduce, distribute and display their Application. <br><br>  <b>LIMITATION OF LIABILITY</b> <br><br>  By participating in the Contest, the Participant (or, if necessary, the participant‚Äôs parents or guardians) agrees to free and insulate the sponsor and its partners, branches, subsidiaries, advertising agencies, agents and their employees, managers, directors, and representatives from any claims losses and damages arising from his participation in this competition. <br><br>  <b>CONDITIONS</b> <br><br>  This competition is subject to and is conducted in accordance with the laws of England and Wales. <br><br>  If for any reason the competition cannot work as planned for any reason beyond the control of the sponsor, the Sponsor reserves the right, at its own discretion, to cancel, terminate or suspend the competition.  The sponsor reserves the right, at its discretion, to change the official rules at any time during the competition. <br><br><h4>  On the 9th, <a href="http://www.raspberrypi.org/archives/1545">another news</a> was published on the official website of the Raspberry Pi: </h4><br>  Here is an A3 poster for you, print and post at your school, scout group, programming circle, Makespace, Hacklab or another youth club to promote our summer programming competition for kids, announced this weekend at <a href="http://www.gamesbritannia.com/">Games Britannia</a> .  Thanks, as always, to the most beautiful Paul Beech for his graphic sorcery. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/ee7/2d2/205/ee72d2205cb2858c1b31dabfe1cb2a81.png" alt="image"><br><br>  <a href="">Click to download PDF version</a> (it says everything that is in the first news, except for the code in Basic - approx. Transl.) <br><br>  If you do not own a Raspberry Pi, do not panic: you can participate.  Use QEMU to emulate a Raspberry Pi on Windows.  (A description of what you need to do <a href="http://www.raspberrypi.org/phpBB3/viewtopic.php%3Ff%3D26%26t%3D5743">in this thread</a> .) <br><br>  <i>Added: some of you are asking about whether an application using existing software libraries or third-party tools (for example, graphics) is counted as ‚Äúeverything is done by me‚Äù.</i> <i><br><br></i>  <i>If you are using publicly available software libraries, such as Pygame, this is absolutely normal.</i> <i><br><br></i>  <i>If you use funds created by someone else, this is what we will consider in each particular case on an individual basis.</i>  <i>We will be waiting for your statements, what work on the project you have done, and what has been done by someone else.</i>  <i>We expect that the vast majority of works will be done personally by you, but we understand that not everyone has such diverse skills and interests that he can program and create graphics at the same level.</i>  <i>A few thousand lines of code written by you that controls several sprites drawn by your friend - this is normal, for reference, this is a kind of balance that we will be looking for.</i> <br><br><h4>  Comrades, discuss the news! </h4><br><h5>  PS Emulator Raspberry Pi for Windows - <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/rpiqemuwindows/">here</a> </h5></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/147540/">https://habr.com/ru/post/147540/</a></p>
