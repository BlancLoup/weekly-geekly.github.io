      I do not claim 100% loyalty to this article, it is based only on my opinion and personal experience :) <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  <a href="http://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/SSL">SSL</a> - Secure Sockets Layer - a standard for sending encrypted data over a network.  For the web industry, this is the <a href="http://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTPS">HTTPS protocol</a> . <br><br><h3>  About certificates in general and why they need to be signed. </h3><br><br>  First, let's look at what an <abbr>SSL</abbr> certificate is. <br><br><blockquote>  Hereinafter, we will focus mainly on web sites.  Questions SSL + FTP, Email, digital signatures of the source code, etc. for the time being aside. </blockquote><br><br>  An SSL certificate is an individual digital signature of your domain.  He might be: <br><br><ol><li>  Self-signed  This means that you yourself gave yourself a certificate, and signed it yourself. </li><li>  Signed by an untrusted certification authority.  This means that the site certificate has been verified, but the ‚Äúverifier‚Äù himself has not been awarded. </li><li>  Signed by a trusted CA.  This means that the certificate data has been verified by the company that is entitled to it, they at least exist. </li></ol><br><br>  Let us examine them in more detail. <br><br>  A self-signed certificate does not guarantee anything.  Anyone can take and issue such a certificate.  All browsers provide the client with a pre-warning that the certificate is not reliable. <br>  A certificate signed by a non-trusted CA does not confirm anything either, since  There are CAs selling certificates to anyone and without checks.  Most browsers respond to such certificates in the same way as self-signed ones. <br><br>  A certificate signed by a trusted source (for example, Thawte or VerySign) confirms that: <br><br><ul><li>  This site really belongs to the company for which it claims to be itself, and not Vasya Fisher from a neighboring entrance. </li><li>  The company that the site represents really exists in life, and not in Vasya‚Äôs thoughts from a neighboring entrance. </li><li>  The data of this company is verified and registered by the certification center. </li></ul><br><br>  Browsers do not issue an error to trusted certificates. <br><br>  But it is technically.  And now that shows the trusted certificate to your site visitor. <br><br><ul><li>  This is really the site we went to, not deface or phishing. </li><li>  The site is created in earnest and for a long time.  In general, those who want to ‚Äúplay a week‚Äù are not ready to pay money for a certificate. </li><li>  The site belongs to the company, or registered physical.  person, not anonymous anonymous.  Pluses are clear - those who want to cheat or steal rarely seek to certify their identity. </li><li>  The company is concerned about the security of information and confirmation of its authenticity. </li><li>  If something happens, this company can be found through the certifier. </li></ul><br><br>  Many users (especially foreign ones, ours are not used to it yet), a self-signed certificate (or the lack of SSL in things related to services \ finance \ privacy) may, if not scare away, put a fat minus in your favor. <br><br>  My personal conclusion: on all sites related to online commerce, payments, personal information should be SSL. <br><br><h3>  Types of certificates. </h3><br><br>  Suppose, guided by the considerations from Part 1 of the article, you decided to buy a signed certificate.  What will be your surprise when you find out on the CA site that they are different :) <br><br>  Types of certificates: <br><br>  <strong>Esential SSL</strong> is the least expensive and fastest certificate.  Available for both legal and individuals.  Only ownership of the domain name is checked, personal data or company registration is not verified.  Issued on 1 domain. <br><br>  <strong>Instant SSL</strong> - available for individuals.  persons and for jur.  individuals.  The ownership of the domain, the registration data of the company or the identity of a person is checked.  faces.  Issued on 1 domain. <br><br>  <strong>SGC SSL certificate.</strong>  - Similar to Instant SSL, but with support for 40-bit extensions (relevant for older OS and browsers).  Issued on 1 domain, or wildcard (see below). <br><br>  <strong>Normal Wildcard.</strong>  - the same as a regular certificate, but is issued not for 1 domain, but for all subdomains of the root domain.  Those.  not only on domain.com, a and on <a href="http://www.domain.com/">www.domain.com</a> , bill.domain.com, etc.  It is much more expensive. <br><br>  <strong>EV (Extended Validation) certificate.</strong>  - extended verification certificate, available only to legal entities.  Domain ownership is checked, the company, notarized translations of documents into English, require confirmation of data by a third party.  Allows you to install on the site a picture of confirmation of possession and is displayed in browsers as guaranteed to be trusted (in green), against the yellow of ordinary certificates.  It is 2-3 times more expensive than usual, registration takes a long time. <br><br>  In the browser it looks like this: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/48c/dd1/5ca/48cdd15ca1392c93d3d9366e40de2aff.gif"><br><br>  <strong>EV Wildcard and EV SGC.</strong>  - similar to Wildcard and SGC, but with extended verification. <br><br>  Instant and Essential certificates are positioned as a product for websites of individuals and organizations that are not related to e-commerce. <br>  Extended Validation - for sites related to finance, services (Internet banking, payment systems, online stores, etc.). <br><br>  In the next article I will write how to choose a registrar and get a certificate. <br></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/51315/">https://habr.com/ru/post/51315/</a></p>
