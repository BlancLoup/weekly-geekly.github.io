  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Reception for developers to overcome procrastination</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  There are programmers who "live" their work.  They think about work day and night, they are not distracted by petty domestic problems (they are above it, they ‚Äúhover‚Äù over it).  But this situation is not all programmers.  Many people need to be successful in work, at home, at the stadium, and at the climbing gym ... You probably understand.  However, such multitasking leads to the fact that you need to return to the tasks at work.  And then there is a psychological resistance that leads to procrastination.  To solve the problem of procrastination of the beginning of the working day (or even the beginning / continuation of work after the break), this method is proposed. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Before you begin, take a sheet, tablet or other means where you can record your thoughts.  And start to write down your thoughts about the current project / task: <br><br><ol><li>  think about <b>what to do?</b>  - list the functionality that you want to implement (maybe only today), list what requirements you need to implement, what goals the development should achieve; </li><li>  think about <b>how you will implement this</b> , which classes, functions, methods you use, which algorithms are best to use; </li><li>  think over, <b>allow yourself to consider the implementation in detail</b> , compare algorithms, compare possible approaches, think about the names of functions, possibly variables, think over API, details of the user interface, if your task includes developing a UI; </li><li>  <b>think about what functionality is best implemented first</b> , think about why it is worth doing; </li><li>  <b>think about how you will implement this functionality</b> . </li></ol><br>  If you can begin to implement, then proceed. <br><br><h3>  If you're still reading ... </h3><br>  You can also, before you finish work (go home from work) briefly write about what you can do next time (next business day).  And when you come, start by reading these notes.  And then proceed to the reception to overcome procrastination.

      Successes!  And successful work. <br><br><h3>  If you are still reading II ... (or why it works) </h3><br>  If you read articles on procrastination, you will learn that: <br><br><h4>  * Procrastination occurs when there is uncertainty in the success of the work </h4><br>  Using this technique, you can consider the task and, if you wish, answer questions regarding the best implementation of the task.  You are not in a hurry to do coding and come across a wall of a hasty and impossible decision.  You have a stock in the form of what you have thought of solving the problem.  All your experience allows you to use the advantages of many years of development in order to evaluate the problem on the paper, the problem you have already solved, and use this experience to figure out how to solve another problem. <br><br><h4>  * After, relatively speaking, climbing or karting evenings, you just may not want to do the work </h4><br>  This technique makes it possible to start with the easy part of the task.  At an easy pace.  (Most likely, you write more slowly than you think.) If you are a genius of 10-finger dialing, then you can just slow down when using the technique.  A letter gives you the opportunity to better reflect what you have written - you can re-read, and evaluate and think over again what you have already written.  This can serve as a trigger for further thoughts. <br><br>  Also you are using the reception, already working.  Yes, you do not encode.  But you are already working on the code.  If a lot is done ‚Äúin mind‚Äù, why not code it? <br><br><h4>  * Procrastination occurs if there is a fear of failure. </h4><br>  OK.  But what is more likely you will fail: hastily written code - or thoughtful code?  Where will be more errors? <br><br><h3>  If you are still reading ... (or do you still have questions ...) </h3><br>  Procrastination is a rather complex problem.  Only one trick is offered.  If you want to learn more, then I suggest an article on additional techniques for winning procrastination: <a href="https://habr.com/company/alconost/blog/325174/">How I struggle with procrastination - and usually win</a> . </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/435204/">https://habr.com/ru/post/435204/</a></p>
