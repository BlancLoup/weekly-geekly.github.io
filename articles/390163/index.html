Big brother is the <a href="https://geektimes.ru/company/balrobotov/blog/270378/">second team of</a> participants, has almost finished its robot and considers it a serious bid for victory. <br><br>  Team members are sharply divided into two age groups: two members of 33 years old - Dmitry <a href="https://geektimes.ru/users/diamondmoto83/" class="user_link">Diamondmoto83</a> Eliseev and Andrey Taktashov and their two sons of 5 and 8 years old - Arthur and Dima.  There is still an irregular member of the team - the golden peasant Mishan, on such peasants the country stands, Dima says with Andrey.  In the photo you can see him in the center in characteristic gear, as he is busy with the team in his most important business - welding.

When he got a job here, then in this building there was only a crane beam, it was generally some kind of warehouse.  But Andrey's holy place is never empty and he began to slowly assemble this workshop, which helps him by the way and at work, too, to finish the shoals of suppliers. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/373/dab/85f/373dab85f2a444bfbd72f0f10f82501f.jpg"><br><br>  Dmitry is initially a fan of all kinds of circuits and electronic projects, Andryukha loves iron - machine tools and tools.  Not surprisingly, the guys quickly found the point of intersection and have long been familiar.  Our company Robomow has been working with robotic lawn mowers for 4 years already, we have been jointly sawing robots with Israel, so to speak we optimize it for Russian sites.  And brought us - there was an offer from <a href="https://geektimes.ru/users/webzuweb/" class="user_link">Gloryn</a> Golitsyn‚Äôs <a href="https://geektimes.ru/users/webzuweb/" class="user_link">webzuweb to</a> participate in Bronebote well, and we willingly agreed.  As a result, Slavik left the team and we do everything ourselves. <br><br>  Now the description of the robot RAKE (Grablya). <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/7f0/308/0b0/7f03080b0ccb45969bf0e5a87fb1b492.jpg"><br><br>  This time we did not pursue beauty, but needed the vitality of the robot.  Well, plagiarism, too, did not want to do.  So he appeared this concept - the robot can be turned over, toss and nothing will happen to him. <br><br>  Moves on two engines of 500 watts, controlled by clever controllers made independently, the console is bought in aerobatics.  We use 36 volts to power the motors because of what we were able to reduce peak currents - we wanted to use higher, but the regulations do not allow using 36 volts above.  Plus we have a double reduction! <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/8e4/353/281/8e43532819ac4579ab1ca3af9e1102f4.jpg"><br><br>  The hull is a truss made of steel and titanium.  We cooked it at the rate of direct blows of the Torah - if she sustains him, she sustains anything. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/sjMt-pW7hQ4%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700021,15700186,15700191,15700248,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhh9CaO0daFQ93W3CFU7XFfQ3mmkfA" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  Weapons such as "Grablya" - two "hands" on the sides, and between them a bridge, on which the sharp wedges.  For weapons, a separate 800 watt engine, as well as a double reduction.  The tool can sharply beat or gently clamp an opponent, for example, to transfer it to another part of the ring or to throw it out into a trap.  All this is powered by separate li-fe batteries or gel ones - until we have decided that and that is that. <br><br>  The impact force has not yet been measured, but it should be about 100 kg or more. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/3da/f97/ac6/3daf97ac603b43239f594028bf24dd43.jpg"><br><br>  Hammer hands made it from aviation aluminum from colleagues at the plant.  Rather, they did and we designed, since we are all friends, the guys decided to carve out the details for free when they found out that it was for a combat robot, only paid for the material - man-hours absolutely free - we have a robotics union.  Therefore, we don‚Äôt mind placing a bit of advertising on the robot for the native Moscow mechatronic plant, look at the beauty: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/aea/4fb/549/aea4fb5498c94bbf8060ea032af7bf22.jpg"><br><br>  With all this, the main gag is of course the weight of the robot, it always imposes restrictions and difficulties in choosing materials.  Well, the lack of time - from it everything else.  Last time we faced a margin when we made a big brother there were 160 kilos there - we used steel and forgot to weigh the robot.  This has taught us a lot, and now we are using mostly precious metals - thanks to that Misha. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/3da/f49/9d7/3daf499d723d4a5c99b414cfeff54f5e.jpg"><br><br>  We hope how to light up on the battles themselves and give a fitting rebuff to the champions of the English League of Robotics.  But honestly, we first of all do it for the sake of our sons.  In order to instill in them a feeling of love for the radio department, mechanics ... just to have them do something with their own hands, in short we teach them to be men. And secondly, it‚Äôs just fun and fun, and this is the future. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/f30/384/817/f3038481799249029f19ca8fc6280a77.jpg"><br><br>  In general, come to root for our RAKE at the fights - <a href="http://bronebot.ru/%3Futm_source%3Dgeektimes%26utm_medium%3Dbanner%26utm_campaign%3Dbronebot-21-23-02-16"><b>on February 21-23 at the Olympic,</b></a> we gave our robot everything we knew - now it's up to an honest fight in the arena. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/390163/">https://habr.com/ru/post/390163/</a></p>
