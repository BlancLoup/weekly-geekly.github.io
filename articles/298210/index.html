  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Creation and promotion of the application in the App Store. Part I - Idea</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Perhaps, for the first time, I decided not only to make a product, but also to describe in detail the process of its creation.  And it will be a simple mobile application.  Why is it?  Because it is not difficult to implement, because in a super competitive niche and, of course, I personally find it very interesting.  And if I am not lazy, I will try to talk about all the processes of creation from idea to publication in the App Store and promotion.  Without investors and the budget.  Only brains, talent and a little magic.  For me, this is an experiment.  Join now! <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  To complete the picture, I think it is worth starting from the very beginning.  With dinosaurs.  And ideas.  It is considered that the idea is not worth anything.  Not because it is priceless, but because it‚Äôs so elementary - he sat down and immediately ingeniously invented a working effective model!  Try to somehow create a product without it.  Tell me later what you did :) I am sure that the neglect of the idea was due to laziness.  Very rarely new ones appear. <br><br>  Side-by-side with a shortage of ideas is another problem - the apparent difficulty of entering the market.  It is no secret that the market for mobile applications has almost been formed.  It is rather difficult to get onto it just with something new.  We have to attract users for money: motivated traffic, Facebook / Twitter, ad networks (AdMob, Mopub, iMobi etc.) and other traffic sources.  Moreover, each user is becoming more and more expensive every month.

    <h4>  Who is guilty? </h4><br>  These are inevitable problems of growth.  The number of new developers is constantly growing.  They create all new mobile apps.  It would seem that everything is logical: the more developers, the greater the demand for attracting users (the cost grows).  The more developers, the more mobile applications, the harder it is to convince the user to install this particular mobile application (the cost increases).  As a result, successful mobile applications become satellites of web services, allowing this web service to be in the user's pocket, increase loyalty, provide more relevant content, thanks to new data and capabilities - geo, push, gyroscope, camera, etc.  Or, a mobile application has a satellite in the web, partially duplicating its functionality.  This reduces the cost of attraction.  Now users of web versions are converted to users of mobile applications.  And sometimes the opposite - a mobile application becomes a source of leads for another product - a web-service, hardware devices, etc.  Klaaaaass ... Clear and hopeless?  By no means!  We want to make a mobile product.  But for those who are interested in a link with a web-service - a great article on the topic of <a href="https://blog.branch.io/optimizing-desktop-web-to-app-conversions">Best Practice Guide: Convert Web Traffic to Mobile App Users</a> . <br><br><h5>  What to do? </h5><br>  Want the most honest answer?  Do not make a mobile application.  Most often, it is not necessary at all in the initial stages.  From the word ‚Äúabsolutely‚Äù.  The main functionality can be implemented in the web, and after the launch and validation of the project, start thinking about the mobile component.  Unfortunately, many people do not realize that a mobile application is not needed for their specific project.  Sometimes in principle, sometimes at this stage.  And they persistently make them, because it is fashionable and in general everyone is doing it. <br><br>  But sometimes a mobile application is necessary.  And it happens that the project can only live in it.  For example: <br><ul><li>  Use of certain hardware components of the phone - camera, gyroscope, accelerometer, GPS, Touch ID, 3D Touch, etc. </li><li>  High frequency of product use - messages, entertainment content, on-demand services </li><li>  Games. </li><li>  Outdoor applications - taxi call, SOS button. </li><li>  Companion for hardware devices. </li><li>  Special phone applications - customization, VPN, etc. </li></ul><br><br>  So, we faced the task of what is to be done exactly mobile and exactly new.  Or old, but in a new way.  For such people, there is a special niche, quite labor-intensive - to create products that use the latest technological innovations.  Each innovation in the iPhone favorably opens new niches - Siri, Touch ID, 3D Touch, etc.  All these technologies allow you to create products that were impossible before they appeared or create a demand for similar products. <br><br><h4>  Eureka! </h4><br>  And we found such a product!  The product is at the peak of the new iPhone features (3D Touch and live photos) designed only for the phone - animated screensavers for the phone.  In the next article I will explain why it is they and how we are going to differ from thousands of similar products.  But now about the name. <br><br>  I worked on a huge number of mobile applications, mostly in the Business and Productivity categories.  And I know for sure that the name should: <br><ul><li>  Explicitly point to the essence of the application (Image Transfer, Eddy Cloud Player, etc.) </li><li>  Be the first in the App Store search results. </li></ul><br><br>  We had to give up the first rule and we chose just a unique name - AWWWA. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/megamozg/post_images/a36/a2f/62f/a36a2f62f61e1359b4442e1f86ca505b.jpg" alt="AWWWA wallpapers"><br><br>  The choice of the name was also influenced by the ability to customize and scale the logo (all of a sudden we will become super popular).  Even made a video about it. <br><iframe width="420" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/HNoygyxylro%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700019,15700186,15700190,15700248,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhjVVXjepS86CIzggpvh3_lNK88svw" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  So, the ingredients that we need to create AWWWA: <br><ul><li>  Super cool partners from the Creative Bureau SPONGE </li><li>  No less cool iOS developer </li><li>  iCloud for Developers </li><li>  The presence in the phone 3D Touch </li><li>  Creative or connection and the Internet, here as lucky. </li></ul><br><br>  All for now.  In more detail about the essence of the application, I will definitely tell in the following publications.  I promise to share all insights, including the number of downloads, exit strategy and promotion.  And not to create false expectations - there are already hundreds of such applications.  We mainly rely on our experience, the general abnormality of all participants in this wonderful project and, as a result, a single creative impulse! <br><br>  I would be very grateful if you participate in a survey about such a format for building a product. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/298210/">https://habr.com/ru/post/298210/</a></p>
