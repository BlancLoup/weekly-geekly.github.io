Let us take this news as a reason to look at the latest ratings and other ways to assess the attractiveness, quality of education and level of research in universities in not only Britain, but the whole world. <br><br>  Just to remind that there are ratings of universities of individual states, universities of groups of states and global ratings, in which universities of many countries are compared on a single scale.  In this post I will try to mention the most notable ratings.  In this case, I will focus on English-speaking countries and EU countries, since it is the universities of these countries that are most often attractive for training part of the citizens of the countries of the former USSR. <br><br>  After reading this note, you will find out (if you didn‚Äôt know yet): <br><ul><li>  Where can I see the global rankings of universities as a whole and the ratings of those universities that are active in computer science? </li><li>  where can I see the rankings of universities in the UK? </li><li>  Which universities in the world and in the UK are leaders in training future IT specialists? </li><li>  What UK universities are leading in research? </li><li>  Where to go to study in the UK, if you do not want to pay a lot of money? </li></ul>

      All who are interested in this topic, I invite under the cat. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  University rankings are used by consumers of university services (for example, students when making a primary decision on choosing a place of study), financiers (when making a decision on funding), as well as by universities themselves.  Once in the first positions of such a rating, universities can use this fact for their advertising.  For example, some universities write in their advertising brochures that they are ‚ÄúNumber 1 in student satisfaction‚Äù (this is not what you thought).  Naturally, university staff do a lot to ensure that their university comes out on top in at least some category.  For example, the head of the department in which I worked, sought the purchase and delivered the new TV to the installation site.  He also organized a party for students.  The fact that students could stay working in the building until late, I suspect, was also his merit.  Another university, along with libraries, built a new building.  It contains the most frequently requested books, furniture for independent work, rooms for group work, a cafe, security, and soft sofas.  And, most importantly, everything in this building is open 24 hours a day.  Students can stay overnight and work.  There are several such 24-hour buildings at the university.  Their guards do not just keep order in the building, but also help them fight off Gopnik at night.  As a result, this university also received its place in the ranking, uses this fact in advertising and in the hope that in the future there will be an increase in the number of foreign students and the amount that the university will earn on them. <br><br>  Before continuing, it is worth mentioning already existing publications on related topics on Habr√©.  Not much more than a year ago, <a href="https://megamozg.ru/users/rg_software/" class="user_link">rg_software</a> published a detailed note <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/195092/">on university rankings: separating grains from chaff</a> , in which he critically analyzed university rankings.  In the same place he wrote why ratings are needed, what are the features of rating supply.  I have nothing to argue with him.  So I will not repeat what he has already described well and will simply recommend reading his article to those readers who need general and overview information on ratings.  In August 2014, another article was published by the author of <a href="https://megamozg.ru/users/mpalma/" class="user_link">MPalma</a> , <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/altweb/blog/232439/">Where to go to study: ranking of universities based on reference ranking</a> .  In this publication, the author spoke about Webometrics, the project site for ranking scientific and educational institutions of the world, as well as mentioned other resources on which other indices of such institutions are indicated. <br><br>  Moreover, while writing this post, I discovered that there is an article <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%25A0%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B6%25D0%25B8%25D1%2580%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B2%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B5_%25D0%25BA%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BB%25D0%25BB%25D0%25B5%25D0%25B4%25D0%25B6%25D0%25B5%25D0%25B9_%25D0%25B8_%25D1%2583%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B2%25D0%25B5%25D1%2580%25D1%2581%25D0%25B8%25D1%2582%25D0%25B5%25D1%2582%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B2">about the ranking of colleges and universities on</a> Wikipedia.  It contains the most comprehensive list of resources where you can see the ratings. <br><br>  Therefore, in the same publication I will review the latest rankings of universities in the world, the community of states and individual states.  But I will do it in such a way as to supplement already published notes with a bias in the IT specialty and compare the existing ratings.  In the first part I will mention global ratings, in the second - the ratings of universities in the UK. <br><br><h1>  Global ratings </h1><br>  Just to remind you that under the global rankings of universities, I will mean ratings made up for countries of the world and not divided by individual community of countries and individual countries. <br><br><h2>  Ratings reflecting the situation in the areas of IT </h2><br><br><h3>  Rating of the center of world-class universities at Shanghai University (Eng. Center for World-Class Universities of Shanghai Jiao Tong University) </h3><br>  This center has been preparing ratings since 2003, and on <a href="http://www.shanghairanking.com/ru/index.html">the project website</a> you will find <a href="http://www.shanghairanking.com/ru/ARWU2014.html">a university ranking by country</a> .  The three leaders are as follows: Harvard University (eng. Harvard University), Stanford University (eng. Stanford University) and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (eng. Massachusetts Institute of Technology).  Leaders from non-US universities: University of Cambridge (Eng. University of Cambridge) (fifth place), University of Oxford (Eng. University of Oxford) (ninth place), and the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology in Zurich (Eng. Swiss Federal Institute of Technology Zurich) (nineteenth place). <br><br>  And the most interesting, on another page of the project there are university rankings in <a href="http://www.shanghairanking.com/ru/SubjectMathematics2014.html">mathematical</a> , <a href="http://www.shanghairanking.com/ru/SubjectPhysics2014.html">physical</a> , <a href="http://www.shanghairanking.com/ru/SubjectChemistry2014.html">chemical</a> , <a href="http://www.shanghairanking.com/ru/SubjectCS2014.html">computer</a> and <a href="http://www.shanghairanking.com/ru/SubjectEcoBus2014.html">economic</a> sciences.  So, in computer science, the leaders are Stanford University (eng. Stanford University), Masachusets Institute of Technology (eng. Massachusetts Institute of Technology) and University of California at Berkeley (eng. University of California-Berkeley).  Of non-American universities in the first place: University of Toronto (eng. University of Toronto) (tenth place), Swiss Federal Institute of Technology (eng. Swiss Federal Institute of Technology Zurich) (fifteenth place) and the Israel Institute of Technology (eng. Technion-Israel Institute of Technology) (eighteenth place). <br><br><h3>  THE publication rating </h3><br>  This edition prepares <a href="http://www.timeshighereducation.co.uk/world-university-rankings/2014-15/world-ranking">its ratings</a> from 2010 and divides them by country and by field of science.  Among the fields of science you will find art and humanities, health, science and engineering, physical and social sciences.  IT belongs to the <a href="http://www.timeshighereducation.co.uk/world-university-rankings/2014-15/subject-ranking/subject/engineering-and-IT">scientific engineering field of science</a> and in the ranking of this field of science are all the same leaders: the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (eng. Massachusetts Institute of Technology), Stanford University (eng. Stanford University) and the California Institute of Technology (eng. California Institute of Technology ).  Among non-American universities in the highest positions are Cambridge University (Eng. University of Cambridge), Imperial College London (Eng. Imperial College London) and Oxford University (Eng. University of Oxford) in fifth, sixth and seventh places. <br><br><h3>  Quacquarelli Symonds Rating </h3><br>  A British publisher called Quacquarelli Symonds (QS) also prepares its ratings and publishes their <a href="http://www.topuniversities.com/university-rankings/world-university-rankings/2014">results</a> on the Internet.  Results can be sorted by country, geographic area, groups of scientific disciplines and other criteria.  The leaders of the rating are the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (Eng. Massachusetts Institute of Technology), the University of Cambridge (Eng. University of Cambridge) and Imperial College London (Eng. Imperial College London).  You can view the ranking in engineering and technology, but it requires registration on the site. <br><br><h2>  Other ratings that do not reflect the situation in IT areas </h2><br><br><h3>  National Taiwan University Ranking </h3><br>  Currently <a href="http://nturanking.lis.ntu.edu.tw/DataPage/OverallRanking.aspx%3Fpagesize%3D100%26y%3D2013">available</a> for 2014 rating.  In the first places: Harvard University (eng. Harvard University), Johns Hopkins University (eng. Johns Hopkins University) and Stanford University (eng. Stanford University). <br><br><h3>  Ranking of world universities based on reference ranking </h3><br>  <a href="https://megamozg.ru/users/mpalma/" class="user_link">MPalma</a> has already <a href="http://www.webometrics.info/">written</a> about ranking-based rating rankings in its <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/altweb/blog/232439/">publication</a> .  On the website of this project you can see the rankings of universities in the world, individual countries, countries of the Brics and Civets groups, the Arab World, Asia, Europe, Africa and America. <br><br><h3>  U-multirank </h3><br>  The <a href="http://u-multirank.eu/">u-multirank</a> rating system is created both for comparing universities of the world and building their ratings (the ‚ÄúCompare‚Äù option on the main page) and a guide for choosing a university for potential students (the ‚ÄúFor students‚Äù option).  This system is quite complex and worthy of a separate publication.  In short, the achievements of universities can be compared both in certain areas of science (for example, physics, engineering, business, etc.), and by choosing a separate university and then looking at how it compares to other universities.  At the same time, there is an opportunity to choose many additional comparison conditions, such as the activity of universities in education, science, training programs or industrial connections. <br><br><h1>  UK University Rankings </h1><br><br><h2>  Rating of the Guardian </h2><br>  This publisher has collected on its <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/education/universityguide">website the</a> rankings of universities as a whole, the ratings of <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/education/ng-interactive/2014/jun/03/university-guide-2015-specialist-institutions-league-table">specialized</a> universities and the ratings of universities by <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/education/ng-interactive/2014/jun/03/university-league-tables-2015-by-subject">specialties</a> .  The following universities are <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/education/ng-interactive/2014/jun/03/university-guide-2015-league-table-for-computer-science-and-information-systems">at the top of the computer science</a> training <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/education/ng-interactive/2014/jun/03/university-guide-2015-league-table-for-computer-science-and-information-systems">ranking in this ranking</a> : St. Andrus, Imperial College London, Oxford, Cambridge, Bermingham, Edinburgh and University College London.  This stanitsa also reflects student satisfaction indices, the ratio between the number of students and the number of employees, and the percentage of employed students after graduation.  If you click on the name of these universities in this ranking, you will see a list of training courses offered by these institutions. <br><br><h2>  Full university guide rating </h2><br>  <a href="http://www.thecompleteuniversityguide.co.uk/league-tables/rankings">Here</a> you can see the ratings of universities in general and ratings in certain areas of science.  Also in the table you can find indicators of student satisfaction, evaluation of research activity.  In computer science, the leaders are universities: Cambridge, Imperial College London, Oxford, St. Andrus, Daram, and University College London. <br><br><h1>  Research Rankings in Higher Education Institutions in the UK </h1><br>  The report is published on the <a href="http://www.ref.ac.uk/">project</a> website, in which universities are evaluated <a href="http://results.ref.ac.uk/Results/SelectHei">individually</a> and by <a href="http://results.ref.ac.uk/Results/SelectUoa">field of</a> science.  The leaders in the overall ranking are the same - the universities of Oxford, University College London, Imperial College London.  High rates of scientific activity in the field of computer science showed universities of Manchester, Shefilda and Warwick.  Report data for those who wish to delve deeper, <a href="http://results.ref.ac.uk/DownloadFile/AllResults/xlsx">are available for download</a> . <br><br><h1>  findings </h1><br>  Were briefly considered the ratings of universities in the field of training and research work in the world and in the UK.  If we confine ourselves to the universities of Great Britain, then it can be noted that the leaders of both computer science and research work in the field of computer science are the same universities of Oxford, University College London, Imperial College London. <br><br>  That is, we see the expected - where scientific activity is strong, the quality of education is higher (and vice versa).  The universities of Oxford, University College London, Imperial College London - are widely known universities, the cost of education in which is often high.  The cost of living in London and Oxford is also higher than in other cities in the UK.  However, here in the ranking of scientific activity at a sufficiently high level are the universities of the cities of Manchester, Shefield and Warwick, the cost of living and education in which are lower.  If we start from the assumption that a high level of scientific activity contributes to a better education and gaining valuable experience for future work by students, then the universities of Manchester, Shefield and Warwick look quite attractive to students. <br><br>  For researchers (postdocs) the most attractive, of course, will be all universities - leaders.  But the cost of living in the cities of Manchester, Sheffield and Warwick is lower, and, therefore, the possibility of accumulating money in your account will be higher. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/296674/">https://habr.com/ru/post/296674/</a></p>
