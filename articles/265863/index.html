So said last year, HR analyst guru Josh Bersin, and this phrase marked the birth of a new reality in the HR market.  In this new reality, the search and hiring of the best talents has become so complicated that recruiters are now forced not only to seek and hire talents, but to be friends with them, motivate and attract them, in other words - to treat candidates as clients - just like when selling a product or service, only the product or service becomes the employer, its brand, corporate culture. <br><br> <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/oracle/blog/265863/"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/3c6/ecf/ddc/3c6ecfddc4094e4cb44fdbc8aa6b854e.png"></a> <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  How to do it?  Let us turn to statistics.  First, from the Adecco Global Recruiting Study (2015), it is known that 62% of applicants in Western Europe use social media in their job search - this means that you must ensure your company‚Äôs presence on social networks.  Secondly, Glassdoor's Rise of Mobile Job Search Survey (2014) statistics show that 90% of applicants prefer to use mobile devices for their job search - and this means that you need to optimize your career portal for a mobile interface.  Finally - and this is the saddest thing - according to theundercoverrecruiter.com website (2014), 92% of visitors to the career portals do not even try to submit an application.  These candidates are lost for us if we do not take care of them.

      What is needed in order not to lose a valuable candidate at the entrance, ‚Äúsell‚Äù the company to him, engage him in the recruiting process, bring him to recruitment (if he is suitable for us, of course), and then softly adapt, immerse into our corporate culture, make him feel part of the team?  In modern conditions for this, of course, you need a comprehensive solution.  And Oracle has such a solution. <br><br><h1>  <font color="#ff0000">Oracle Talent Acquisition Cloud</font> </h1><br>  What is Oracle Talent Acquisition Cloud?  This is a cloud solution that is part of the Oracle Cloud HCM Suite and covers all stages of the full cycle of attracting talent (Fig. 1): <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/41f/65e/6f6/41f65e6f6e7a405a8c242caa05167ef9.png"><br>  Let's understand how the full cycle of attracting talent works. <br><br>  The initial stage of collecting information about potential candidates and their involvement in the recruitment process is called sourcing.  Oracle Talent Acquisition Cloud fully automates this stage, including collecting recommendations and attracting candidates in social networks, advertising vacancies, developing the employer's brand, creating and maintaining talent communities, and organizing targeted Internet portals for communication and information specialists. <br><br>  The following is a selection of candidates - you need to plan interviews with suitable candidates and invite them to these interviews, happy candidates to make proposals, and according to the law, notify the rest of the employers of the refusal in writing, coordinating each step with the business units.  Even those who have never been engaged in the selection of personnel guess what kind of routine it is.  Fortunately, Oracle Talent Acquisition Cloud automates all specified processes. <br><br>  The third stage is the adaptation stage.  A successful candidate needs to immerse him in a new environment for him - corporate culture, policies, procedures, processes - and make sure that he begins to work productively for the organization as quickly as possible. <br><br>  Now let's discuss in more detail how all three stages are organized in the Oracle Talent Acquisition Cloud. <br><br><h1>  <font color="#ff0000">Sourcing</font> </h1><br>  At the sourcing stage of candidates, it is important to create the widest possible funnel of talent.  The functionality of Oracle Talent Acquisition Cloud, which is called Social Sourcing, allows you to organize companies to attract candidates not only through social networks, but also within your own corporate community.  After all, employees not only can, but also want to recommend their acquaintances, their former colleagues or their classmates to work in the organization - which means it‚Äôs worth giving them a handy tool that makes it easy to post vacancy announcements on social networks or send them via e-mail mail.  Experience shows that candidates recommended by employees of an organization are often especially interesting for recruiting.  In a number of companies, there is a bonus system for employees who recommend successful candidates, and the corresponding functionality is also provided in the Oracle Talent Acquisition Cloud system. <br><br>  At this stage, it is already important to start communicating with potential candidates - even unilaterally.  The sooner you attract a candidate with certain media materials, for example, videos about the corporate culture of the company, or success stories of other candidates who have come to similar positions, the greater the chance that a suitable candidate, ‚Äúconsonant‚Äù with your organization, will not pass by jobs. <br><br>  A great advantage will be the new user experience that a candidate will receive by viewing your career portal and submitting a resume - for example, if you offer him convenient and powerful job search opportunities with a selection by region, keywords and specialties, while the site will look modern, attractive and targeted  It will be a huge advantage if the candidate has the opportunity to submit a resume using a mobile application, or if he can, instead of tiring to fill out a regular application form, upload his LinkedIn profile to a career portal. <br><br>  The Oracle Talent Acquisition Cloud portal admin tools allow you to view site statistics and open vacancies, group these vacancies, and manage the promotion of vacancies within the company, through targeted mailings, through talent communities, social networks, etc.  The ‚ÄúAnalyst‚Äù section allows analyzing the behavior of candidates and identifying the most productive channels for receiving information about candidates. <br><br>  All these opportunities are implemented, for example, on the eBay company's career portal, through which it passed - or, as they say now, more than 90 thousand vacancy announcements were ‚Äúshared‚Äù.  Another example is Dell, which also uses the Oracle Talent Acquisition Cloud, and has already ‚Äúshared‚Äù about 80 thousand vacancy announcements. <br><br><h1>  <font color="#ff0000">Selection of candidates</font> </h1><br>  Candidate selection is the very moment when your recruiters have to work overtime to look at thick packs of resumes, sifting out the right candidates over and over again and inviting inappropriate people for interviews - it is very important to have adequate screening tools.  These tools will allow you to immediately get sorted lists of candidates - and see which of them is the best for everyone, who is generally suitable and who is not at all suitable.  But this is not the end of your document flow, but it is just beginning, because there are still appointments, consultations with business units, selection of the most suitable candidates and placing offers.  Oracle Talent Acquisition Cloud allows you to identify the best candidates and streamline the hiring process. <br><br>  You can simultaneously conduct multiple selection processes at different job levels.  The processing of vacancies for beginners will not be overloaded with additional stages of selection, and for high-level professionals, on the contrary, the system will request certificates, assign the necessary tests and interviews with several levels of managers.  The solution allows all these processes to organize, lead and control in parallel.  Candidates will be ranked - by experience, by education, by knowledge of the language, by qualifications, availability of certificates, etc.  (Fig.2). <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/2d8/79b/3c2/2d879b3c234c47849339835a5a433d3a.png"><br>  The workflow automation system contains templates for letters of vacancies, invitations, refusals, etc.  - for all occasions.  For example, a successful candidate ‚Äúclosed‚Äù a vacancy, a corresponding event occurs in the system, and all other candidates are notified that the vacancy is closed, the decision was made in favor of another candidate. <br><br>  A separate plus to the Oracle Talent Acquisition Cloud is the opportunity to involve the hiring managers themselves in the hiring process.  As a rule, business managers initially do not know what kind of candidates candidates have to handle - and only when they realize how much interviews are needed to select the three best candidates, does respect for the work of personnel officers appear.  To do this, our system offers managers a ‚Äúpersonal account‚Äù with which you can work through the mobile application ‚Äî view the list of actual candidates, compare them with each other and give feedback on them.  The application is also useful for an interview - so that the manager has before his eyes both the candidate‚Äôs profile and the list of questions for him (Fig. 3). <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/26a/49f/826/26a49f82653b4219bde5e41f228a4e66.png"><br><br><h1>  <font color="#ff0000">Adaptation</font> </h1><br>  Oracle Talent Acquisition Cloud offers adaptation portals and adaptation procedures to guide a new employee in the company.  The system allows you to use social networks, mobile portals, mobile applications.  You can see at what stage the candidate is now, what services are involved in the adaptation process, what tasks are assigned to them and what are the deadlines for the implementation of these tasks.  Each process is supported by a performance analysis, corresponding reporting and statistics - you always understand where to go next and which processes need to be optimized. <br><br><h1>  <font color="#ff0000">Analytics</font> </h1><br>  In the end, we definitely need to know how efficiently we work - we need end-to-end analytics throughout all stages of the talent attraction process, which will allow us to understand exactly where the most successful candidates come from, how reliable the pipeline is for candidates and what is the price of hiring your employees.  To do this, the Oracle Talent Acquisition Cloud solution has a business intelligence section that helps navigate the process and shows the results of our work - how relevant are our sources of attracting talent, how many candidates have been taken from the total, what sources give hiring, in what period is more total hiring, what is the efficiency of recruiters.  Such analytics will allow you to effectively form your budget for attracting personnel, and, equally important, to justify such a budget before management and protect it. <br><br><h1>  <font color="#ff0000">Success stories</font> </h1><br>  This article has already given two successful examples of using the Oracle Talent Acquisition Cloud solution - eBay and Dell.  Here are some more examples: <br><br><ul><li>  The multinational company Monsanto, the world leader in the field of plant biotechnology.  The company accelerated hiring decisions by 70%.  The savings achieved by the decision, the company estimates in the millions of dollars. </li><li>  The Kent County Council (UK) was able to reduce the average time to create a vacancy announcement by 75% from four days to one. </li><li>  In the Chinese automaker Geely, the hiring process has accelerated by 25%, while the resume screening time has been reduced by 30%. </li><li>  In the Swiss insurance holding B√¢loise, the cost of hiring in corporate functions has decreased by 92.3%. </li><li>  In the international transport company CSX Corporation, the time for closing vacancies was reduced by 40%, and the presentation of the available talent pool improved. </li><li>  Spanish construction conglomerate Acciona was able to optimize the time and cost of recruiting by 25% and 30%, respectively. </li></ul><br>  Finally, it is important to note that the Oracle Talent Acquisition Cloud solution is quite voluminous and requires certain work skills from administrators.  Users are certainly much simpler - but in any case, Oracle University has programs for teaching both those and others, and the benefits of implementing and using the solution effectively - at least by the example of the above companies - are too obvious to be neglected. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/265863/">https://habr.com/ru/post/265863/</a></p>
