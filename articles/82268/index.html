  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Intel Clarkdale or race for megahertz reborn?</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Intel has released the new 32 nm processors Clarkdale just a month ago, but they have already become the epitome of the NetBurst era.  The overclocking potential of the new processors is amazing, and the number of records that well-known overclockers have already gained over a dozen records.  Recently, I introduced you to an <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/hardware/80731/">Intel Core i5 660 processor</a> , and today I want to tell you about a unique instance of the Intel Core i5 670 processor. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/007/398/ba4/007398ba46845597f64e7c65af281def.png" alt="image"><br><br>  The owner of this instance is the famous Taiwanese overclocker NickShih.  It was he who succeeded to the first in the world to conquer the 7 GHz line on a processor built on the core of Clarkdale.  What is the salt?  What does he know, what others do not know about, or just good luck?  You will find the answer under the cut. <a name="habracut"></a>

      The answer is quite simple - a combination of some secrets in overclocking in combination with a successful sample did their job.  Intel has once again wiped its nose to its competitors from AMD.  AMD managed to get processors that didn‚Äôt lose their efficiency even at temperatures below -200 degrees Celsius, and naturally, AMD was ‚Äúpushing‚Äù like an overclocking brand, inviting well-known overclockers to overclocking events.  And their main trump card was the use of liquid helium, the temperature of which is close to absolute zero, as a cooling processor.  Such cooling allowed us to conquer the line at 7 GHz.  Intel from this competitor trump could not respond in any way.  Intel processors with modern architecture were faster, but they could not lure people with beautiful numbers.  Now everything fell into place. <br><br>  <a href="http://valid.canardpc.com/show_oc.php%3Fid%3D979124">valid.canardpc.com/show_oc.php?id=979124</a> <br><br>  32nm technical process allowed to reduce the heat emission of processors, and therefore it was possible to increase their overclocking potential.  The processors turned out to be very cold, and the increase in voltage during overclocking responds simply "with a bang."  But another important limiting factor in overclocking Intel processors was their inability to operate at too low temperatures, although some representatives of the NetBurst architecture had a 196 degree bar.  With the release of the new processor line, Intel decided to lure customers with overclocking processor abilities. <br><br><img src="http://content.foto.mail.ru/bk/abc2/306/i-369.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  The main secret of overclocking new processors to record temperatures lies in the architecture of the motherboard.  Already three manufacturers - EVGA, Gigabyte, MSI have revealed their trump cards, showing the necessary element on the motherboard.  It is in the circuit of only two legs of one resistor that the whole secret is hidden.  This allows Clarkdale processors to operate at temperatures down to -196 degrees.  And without such a modification, the processor will lose its performance even at -100 degrees. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/a2f/304/e5b/a2f304e5bcf21e09160fa1503fbdb38d.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Now we can safely say that Intel frequencies are not only corn, at 7 GHz the Super Pi1M test was passed.  What can already be said about a certain stability at such high frequencies.  Today it is the absolute record in the world in this category. <br><br>  From myself I want to add that I look forward to the end of the year to see the new AMD processor architecture, and I really want to hope that they will be able to create competitive models.  And this in turn will make Intel think about lowering the prices of its processors. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/82268/">https://habr.com/ru/post/82268/</a></p>
