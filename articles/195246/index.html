      To join testing, you must complete a special quest from Valve: <br><br>  Until <b>October 25</b> , go to Steam and visit <a href="http://steamcommunity.com/my/badges/15">the quest page</a> to check the status of your quest to participate in the beta test. <br>  1. Join the <a href="http://steamcommunity.com/groups/steamuniverse">Steam Universe</a> community group <br>  2. Accept the <a href="http://store.steampowered.com/hardwarebeta/">Steam Device Beta Test Agreement</a> <br>  3. Add 10 friends to Steam (if you don‚Äôt have them yet) <br>  4. Create a public profile in the Steam community (if you have not already created it) <br>  5. Play any game with the controller in <a href="http://store.steampowered.com/bigpicture/">Big Picture</a> mode. <br><br><blockquote>  You can fulfill these requirements in any order.  After all the requirements have been met, you will be given a special badge, and you will be officially listed in the list from which we will select the beta test participants / recipients of our devices. <br><br>  On October 25, the list will be frozen, so complete all tasks before this date! <br><br>  Your help in the development process is incredibly important to us.  Your feedback is exactly what the new OS version of Steam will form, as well as the whole category of devices on which it will work. </blockquote><br><br>  Also available <br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">FAQ</b> <div class="spoiler_text">  <b>Where can one buy?</b> <br><br>  Starting in 2014, various devices with SteamOS, created by different manufacturers, will appear on the market. <br><br>  <b>I am completely satisfied with my gaming PC.</b>  <b>Is there a need to purchase a new device?</b> <br><br>  Not.  Everything we have done with Steam over the past 10 years will be maintained and developed in the future. <br><br>  <b>If you provide the OS to device manufacturers, then why does Valve create its own device?</b> <br><br>  We are conducting a beta test of the implementation of all Steam solutions for the living room, so we were forced to build our prototype on which we could conduct tests.  As part of the development process, Valve always relies on the results of testing our products in the real world.  Our system, which we use for testing, is designed for users who want to have as much control over the stuffing of their computers as possible.  Other versions of the system will be optimized for small sizes, prices, lack of noise and other parameters. <br><br>  <b>How will you choose the 300 beta test participants?</b> <br><br>  A small number of testers (no more than 30) will be selected for their contribution to the community and active participation in past beta tests.  The rest will be selected randomly from all remaining users who completed the quest for fitness. <br>  <b>If I create more Steam accounts, will it increase my chances of getting into the beta test?</b> <br><br>  No, it will not work. <br><br>  <b>What are the technical specifications of the prototype from Valve?</b> <br><br>  We will let you know soon.  Do not forget, you will be provided with several devices with different specifications, prices and performance. <br><br>  <b>Where are the photos?</b>  <b>What size is this device?</b> <br><br>  We promise to tell you about it in the near future. <br><br>  <b>When will these prototypes be sent?</b> <br><br>  This year. <br><br>  <b>Will beta testers be allowed to share their impressions and photos online?</b> <br>  Yes, we believe that for the sake of it all is being done.  Testers' comments should come in various forms, for example, in the form of error messages, topics on forums, pictures, 3D printing, haiku, as well as highly publicly expressed opinions. <br><br>  <b>Can I build my own computer and install SteamOS on it?</b> <br><br>  Yes. <br><br>  <b>Can you hack this device?</b>  <b>Run another OS?</b>  <b>Change components?</b>  <b>Install my own programs?</b>  <b>Use to create a robot?</b> <b><br></b> <br><br>  Of course. <br><br>  <b>Can I boot the OS to try it out?</b> <br><br>  You can download it (including the source code, if you are interested), but not now. <br><br>  <b>If I do not get to the beta test, how can I help you and leave a review?</b> <br><br>  Feedback and suggestions will be collected through the Steam Universe group.  Most sections of this group will be open to all Steam users.  Some sections may be accessible only to beta test participants, but all users will have enough ways to share their ideas. <br><br>  <b>What games will be available during the beta test?</b> <br><br>  About 3000 games that are already on Steam.  Hundreds of games with versions for SteamOS, plus those that have not yet come out.  The rest will work without problems through home streaming. <br><br>  <b>What is SteamOS?</b>  <b>What is included in it?</b> <br><br>  Here is a link to what we wrote about SteamOS earlier.  More details will be available soon. <br><br>  <b>Do I have to use the keyboard and mouse in my living room?</b> <br><br>  If you want.  At the same time, both Steam and SteamOS work well with controllers.  But stay tuned - we have more to say about input devices. <br></div></div><br><br>  Interestingly, the company does not oppose the installation of another OS on its console, it does not oppose its hacking and any other modification, as well as Valve declares that in the future the <b>source code of Steam OS</b> will be available <b>.</b> <br><br>  In addition, Family Sharing testing has begun, a feature that allows you to share the game with your friend or family member. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage3/d1e/e6c/be3/d1ee6cbe334991a065eefeeeccc426d1.png"></div><br><br>  <i>Attention, now the registration form for beta testing may not work.</i> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/195246/">https://habr.com/ru/post/195246/</a></p>
