But for this area, too, need its own infrastructure.  But conditions are not always favorable, and integrating partners need to use all their ingenuity and resourcefulness to implement projects. <br><br>  This is, for example, the installation of a solution for UPS in Georgia. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/3d8/8e2/c22/3d88e2c2293644b08d097c67d4da2fa5.jpg">

      No need to be scared, and here (Russia, Ukraine, Belarus) it was, then, of course, all these decisions were adjusted to newer ones and they began to be put in more favorable conditions.  But before that, a bank, a cellular operator, or another company needs to work and make a profit, and not wait for someone to make all the comfortable conditions for their business.  Therefore, the solution is implemented as possible under the existing conditions of the infrastructure. <br><br>  At the moment in Tajikistan there is an acute problem of the deterioration of the old power grids of the republic, which often have not changed since Soviet times.  But the enterprise cannot stop its business, even if there are objective problems with the power grid, which it cannot influence.  Of course, in the long run, this impact will be exercised - the more tax deductions there are, the better the state can equip the infrastructure, including renewing the power grids for the same business. <br><br>  We will talk about the UPS, more precisely about the IPP (constant power supply sources) of industrial scale, and make a detailed photo review of one diesel generator. <a name="habracut"></a><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/f60/bc5/a4e/f60bc5a4e12648c1ba04b95a9018ac19.jpg"><br><br>  One day, at our <a href="http://expo.muk.ua/">IT exhibition,</a> one girl asked: can I put myself like this in an apartment?  To which the manager replied: unless you have a large balcony ... It is clear that the generator stands on the street under the awning and is waiting in the wings.  Or in the basement, with the exhaust pipe removed, or on the roof (you saw the installation on the photo from Georgia). <br><br>  What is a UPS system in a nutshell?  In the panel board, the battery (s), the control panel, and the generator are installed.  When the light is turned off, power is immediately supplied from the battery, the battery can hold a voltage of 5 to 20 minutes.  Most often it is 5 minutes, and only after 5 minutes the generator turns on.  Why?  Because it can easily be that someone made a short circuit with something, and then after a minute went and turned on the switch, then in order not to pull the vain generator there is such a temporary gap.  Next, the generator turns on, it also needs time - 1-2 minutes to give the required voltage.  And it starts working, powering the network, and recharging the battery that has already run down for the future. <br><br>  All these temporary gaps in the system - when what turns on and after what time - are set individually.  But the general rule here is one - nothing immediately turns on, and does not immediately turn off.  Everywhere there is a gap for warming up, a pause in case of some hands at the breaker, etc.  For example, the light was turned off, and if electricity had already appeared, the generator still works for 2-3 minutes, because despite the fact that the light was turned on, it could be turned off right there - there could be some kind of test switch or something. <br><br>  An example from life, the stadium in the city of Millionaire.  The stadium is huge, state-of-the-art, consumes a lot of electricity, so there were two generators of 5 megawatts each, i.e.  10 megawatt - it can be powered with electricity half the city in which the stadium is located!  So, as soon as the match began, they immediately started these two generators and they worked at idle to turn on at any time without starting and warming up.  Because if a tram goes alongside, the voltage will blink, and that - during the match the light will go out? <br><br>  <b>What you need to consider those who only choose a solution for UPS</b> <br><br>  1. Power, it is clear that you need to calculate how much you need, and it is clear that you need to make a margin of power.  And it often happens that the company grows very quickly, and change the UPS to a more powerful one is not always in a hurry.  In such cases, make the UPS work only on the most important business processes of the company (server or something else), those processes that bring money.  And all the other office staff somehow live a couple of hours without mail and facebook. <br><br>  A power supply of about 10 kW is calculated for a bank branch with 3 offices.  In each case, the power is selected individually for the customer.  Much depends on the location of the office, energy consumption, the deterioration of the power line on which the office is located, which is located next to the office. <br><br>  For example, in the same bank that was in the town square, next to the city tree, so when they turned on the tree in the evening, they started to slow down computers with banking programs. <br><br>  2. Generator self-service.  It is very important that the generator itself can diagnose itself and turn on the modes it needs, when necessary.  So that the engineer (who went on vacation) did not stand over him and did not nurse as with a child.  Automatic engine stop at high temperature and liquid overheating, low oil pressure, unsuccessful start, emergency stop, etc.  Everything is important for the safety of service personnel, and also reduces the risk of breakage. <br><br>  <b>The customer is big and small</b> <br><br>  UPS systems are needed where computers need to work 24 hours a day without interruption. <br><br>  Who is interested in? <br>  - Of course, banks, mobile operators. <br>  - Where constant navigation is needed, where safety depends on it.  Railway (without electricity - fraught with train accidents), airports (as the navigation system for airplanes must always work) <br>  - Medical establishments - expensive high-precision equipment can work there, which can burn out from a power surge, and, besides, the surgical department cannot be de-energized during the operation. <br>  - Small and medium business - large online stores, warehouses that need to constantly work and ship the goods. <br>  - It also happens that a private customer puts powerful enough systems - for example, if the lights go out while the sauna is running, this system will pick up and prevent anyone from freezing. <br><br>  <b>What to do if you are a customer</b> <br>  Do not save.  This is not a software or server that needs to be updated constantly.  This is electrical engineering, more precisely electrician, power unit.  It depends on its quality, power and reliability, whether you have an emergency, when your storage system will not work from lack of electricity, and valuable transactions will not be carried out. <br>  On request, the generator should be run-in, depending on the power, from 50 to 100 hours to check not only the generator, but also the entire UPS system. <br><br>  <b>What to do if you are an integrator</b> <br>  Show the customer how much he can lose from idle 1 working hour without electricity of his IT infrastructure.  Since, of course, everyone wants to save everywhere (now there is no money, etc.) But it‚Äôs better not to talk about how much it costs, but how much it can do if a) there is no spare raft and b ) if you save on it. <br><br>  <b>And if the UPS itself stops ?!</b> <br>  It happens in life all.  Maybe the engine is bogged down.  It happens, the control processor burns out on the remote, or on the battery box, but here the supplier already gives a guarantee - either a new one sends it, or this one repairs it.  Warranty on our generators - 2 years. <br><br>  Industry standard for industrial generators - ISO 8528 <br><br>  <b>Diesel Generator Raccoon</b> <br><br>  One side: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/55b/eb6/27c/55beb627cedb4933828aec658377fd7e.jpg"><br><br>  On the other hand: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/816/604/5ff/8166045ff74d41dfb4ca3f0ea551361d.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/3b5/e05/56b/3b5e0556b52a4354967f0116e06b36cd.jpg"><br><br>  Synchronous alternator 400 / 230V, 50 Hz with automatic electronic adjustment of the output voltage: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/089/0b8/d49/0890b8d4927d42d7aebde883b5d889f1.jpg"><br><br>  An important element for transporting such a unit is not on all generators. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/986/412/d1f/986412d1fedc4db6ac8cf89fdc45f949.jpg"><br><br>  Fuel drain plug on the outside.
