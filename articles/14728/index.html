HTC Touch Communicator</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Probably every person is familiar with the state, when you want something, but you can not understand what.  The state of the mobile equipment market can be characterized by just such a reaction of the buyer. <br>  At first, I held to the position that the telephone is a telephone and you just need to call it.  But with the purchase of a PDA, my point of view has changed ... however, the feeling of "dissatisfaction" remains. <a name="habracut"></a><br>  <b>SEARCHING FOR IDEAL</b> <br>  <b>Motorola T191.</b> <br>  Great phone!  What only happened to him was not swimming in champagne, and the dog was nibbling him (he nibbled off the antenna) and dropped from a height ... he called! <br>  <b>Nokia 6021</b> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/olpictures/474/703/4c9/4747034c925f422532a6d4c866ce669e.jpg" width="123" height="210" hspace="10" vspace="10"><br><br>  Purchased from the same position - for calls, but for the global storage of contacts: with ICQ, notes, home addresses ... Called!  But I didn‚Äôt make it sync normally.  Bluetooth worked at first perfectly, a year later it became almost impossible to connect via GPRS via Bluetooth, constant connection breaks, glitches ... interrogated, re-configured, rearranged PC Suite.  But still calling.  Very often it was necessary to write down the address, passport data, ICQ number.  In SMS mode, it was not very convenient to do, the stylus was immediately recalled. <br>  And one more big minus - it was extremely difficult to switch when typing from Russian to english.  A set of numbers was completely absent in the SMS.

      <b>First VGA PDA - ASUS A730</b> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/olpictures/843/2ab/379/8432ab379cd919084afed77f87079a84.jpg" width="195" height="260" hspace="10" vspace="10"><br><br>  Despite the huge number of minuses (about them below), he shook me and did not leave the hands, probably, from half a year.  This includes watching movies and clips, and a collection of photos, and reading books (for me the most important discovery !!) and the Internet and reading mail, music (!!!) with quality at the level of average players. <br>  BUT <br>  - The battery with us, with average use (about video and not talking!) "Sent" us in the evening, when we were tired of dreaming about your favorite music or reading freshly jokes.  It was the MOST huge minus of this particular device. <br>  - Glukavost at the level of Win 95. Curves programs that kill the system, freezes. <br>  - The lack of many necessary features - turning off the screen when listening to music, etc. ... <br>  - Useless fotik - it slowed down and it was impossible to get an elementary sharp picture. <br>  All that was not very stable in MS Windows mobile 2003SE <br><br>  <b>HTC Touch</b> <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/olpictures/a01/9cb/6ac/a019cb6aca8c69956eefcb997eb4cd1b.jpg" width="226" height="317" hspace="10" vspace="10"><br><br>  When I sold the ASUS A730, I realized that I did not have enough e-books, and a lot of small reference information that I always had With me.  In Nokia 6021, much could be downloaded and recorded, but due to the inconvenience of typing without a stylus, the lack of a quick switch to english and poor synchronization, all these functions were reduced to "no."  Nokia is morally obsolete and the thought that a new device is needed has visited my head.  I was an opponent of communicators, because putting a ‚Äúshovel‚Äù or ‚Äúsmall laptop‚Äù to my ear is not aesthetically pleasing and elementary is not convenient.  However, that ‚Äúbright‚Äù memory of my PDA did not give me peace, and therefore I still reluctantly looked at the small communicators, especially since I had not studied the ‚Äúmobility‚Äù market for a long time. <br>  And then I came across the HTC Touch.  This is the smallest device with a screen of 2.8 inches.  Yes, and with Touch Flo - interface allows you to control the device with your finger. <br>  Bought.  The first sensations were also fieric.  Most of all, I was struck by the stability of the device in comparison with my PDA on Windows Mobile 2003SE, which I attribute to the evolutionary Windows Mobile 6.0, which has undergone few changes, but it has significantly added stability.  The build quality and material is excellent.  The layout also: miniSD on 1GB, headset, very comfortable case with a tenacious surface, good protective film on the screen.  True film is too thick, which reduces the sensitivity of the screen. <br>  The device is small - it fits everywhere and weighs 112g.  i.e. dimensions like a regular mobile phone.  A huge plus is the software that comes with our smart animal.  I would call this software even a shell to WM 6. On the desktop there are buttons for switching between very comfortable huge clocks, a weather forecast that works great through GPRS and some organizer for the icons of the most used applications.  Also on the desktop are displayed three indicators with unread: E-mail, SMS and missed calls.  Separately, I want to note the ability to store 100 received answered and missed calls. <br>  With all the splendor of the apparatus, it has tolerable, but still annoying cons ... <br><br>  1) Very small call acceptance and disconnect buttons.  From the first time you will not get for anything.  Well, tell me, who prevented them from doing more? <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/olpictures/095/13b/9b6/09513b9b6cc672081d9c69428d60e324.jpg" width="377" height="295" hspace="10" vspace="10"><br>  2) Due to the large difference in the thickness / width-height ratio of the device, it is not convenient to lie in the hand - it does not take the volume of the palm.  In combination with the first item, it becomes a real inconvenience.  Plus the fact that most of the device is occupied by the screen, that is, when someone pulls it out of their pocket, they will have to grasp the screen. <br>  3) Like any high-tech device, in summer the device heats up during a conversation, respectively, the screen, touching the cheek, heats it and there is something that is usually hot on the cheek, to which something warm is applied, on it. <br>  4) The plus point of the device is that you can change the SIM card and the memory card without turning it off.  But the disadvantage is that it‚Äôs almost impossible to open the panel where Simka and the memory are stored.  The most convenient way for me to open it is a female nail file. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/olpictures/447/071/9ce/4470719ceca1bf9f6a9a24586033c87b.jpg" width="377" height="298" hspace="10" vspace="10"><br>  5) Bluetooth is buggy and hangs the system. <br>  6) A memory card when connected to a computer as a USB flash drive is not detected.  Only through third-party software. <br><br>  The processor, oddly enough, the OMAP 850 with a frequency of 200 MHz pulls the system in a working tuned system of brakes a little.  But it would be more powerful to put percents. <br><br>  Why am I doing all this?  But to what. <br>  The first, third and fourth points of the minuses could be easily corrected.  The fifth and sixth is also not difficult. <br>  With my Nokia 6021, too, it‚Äôs not difficult to fix many minuses: switching from one language to another, dialing numbers in an SMS? <br><br>  Does anyone have a phone that suits him completely, without taking into account the desire to turn the phone into a flying saucer?  Is it really so difficult to find and eliminate these shortcomings during development? <br>  No, it is not difficult, it is just convenient for the manufacturer to keep the buyer in a constant state: ‚ÄúI want something, but I don‚Äôt know.‚Äù <br><br>  Pictures taken from various sites on the Internet.  For ochepyatki and possible illiteracy strictly do not judge. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/14728/">https://habr.com/ru/post/14728/</a></p>
