  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Concept mobile phone for seniors</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  What you need from the phone: <br>  - receive calls; <br>  - call to new numbers with manual dialing; <br>  - call from the phone book; <br>  - independently fill in the phone book. <br><br>  The list of four items is not so small because with ‚Äúregular‚Äù devices my elderly relatives can do even less: reception, manual dialing, and fast dial with one digit.  In practice, phone books are clogged and updated by younger relatives, everything over and above the fast dial is written with a pen on plain paper.  Random sms read out loud by <a href="http://www.mobile-review.com/articles/2007/babushka.shtml">the same relatives</a> . <br><br>  In my project, I tried to give them the opportunity to use <i>all</i> these basic functions by cutting the rest.  Here is a concept video layout, and below is detailed what and why it was done:

Everything that goes on must be understood in this context. <br><br><br><h3>  Problem solving strategy </h3><br>  - Minimizing the number of states of the apparatus.  Due to this, at any time you can perform any action without thinking about anything (about the context). <br>  - Remove the dependence of the control action on the context of use. <br>  - Each control does one thing (as a last resort, in the ‚Äúnot its own‚Äù state of the apparatus, does nothing) and sits strictly in one place. <br>  - Mechanical controls instead of virtual, on-screen options, for simpler, clearer and more familiar. <br>  - The use of the usual "mechanical" concepts. <br>  - Handwriting as the most common way to enter information for Central Asia. <br>  - At each moment of time it should be clear which of the few states the phone is in. <br>  - Minimize settings.  All that can be done automatically and done. <br><br><br><h3>  Some details </h3><br>  <b>Flip</b> .  You open it - the phone changes its shape to less stable, you talk;  talked - returned to him his usual steady form, that is, slammed the flip (like the same door), the call was over.  This is a mechanical concept (or idiom, I don‚Äôt know) in contrast to more virtual and invisible green and red tubes.  At each moment of time, it is clear that ‚ÄúI hung up‚Äù or the conversation continues (a frequent case of misunderstanding of my phone). <br><br>  <b>Volume adjustment</b> .  Special wheel on the end.  In the talk mode you can tweak it, up to broadcast through the speaker.  It will not be possible to damage the hearing because at the very beginning the speaker will broadcast at the same volume as the main speaker. <br><br>  <b>Battery indicator</b> .  In its normal state, it simply does not exist.  In the case of a decrease in charge, it may appear as a flashing / multi-colored light bulb on the front. <br><br>  <b>Display signal network</b> .  It is not there, because it is not needed and it is difficult (and there is no need to look at it every time).  In the case of a completely bad or absent connection, this will be unambiguously said right in the ear of the subscriber. <br><br>  <b>Initial screen</b> .  He is the only one.  It is also the address book: at any moment we have one phone number available from this book (I found it difficult to understand the concept of the selected element in the GUI of Central Asia).  At the top of the name of the subscriber, which is optionally entered by the <i>stylus</i> as handwriting.  Lower the number that is dialed from the block of numeric keys. <br><br>  <b>Editing the address book</b> .  At any time we have one contact from the address book.  At the same time, with this contact you can do anything: change the name of the contact, erase the name.  You can just draw a flower next to anything ‚Äî after all, every name is essentially a bitmap, a picture and <i>is not interpreted by</i> electronics <i>in any way</i> .  That's just the number can not be changed - you have to create a new contact.  You can also delete a contact (by intensive striking out with a stylus). <br><br>  Any change of contact is fixed instantly, in fact and as on paper, so there is no need to confirm your actions in front of the piece of iron. <br><br><blockquote>  Because of these features, sorting the address book is hardly possible.  Although in theory you can apply recognition. </blockquote><br><br>  <b>Call log</b> .  The last dialed call is always visible on the screen.  The number of slots is limited, yes. <br><br>  <b>Screen</b>  Well, probably from electronic paper, so as not to have it transferred from one state to another.  The backlight is automatic or not needed. <br><br><br><h3>  What not </h3><br>  - Hours.  A rare case that my relatives learned the time so.  (Actually, they simply did not fit into the concept.) <br>  - Enter and, accordingly, change the PIN. <br>  - smsok. <br>  - Blocking: not needed due to the flip. <br>  - Export / import contacts and store them on a sim card.  This is potentially more sad.  That is, you can store numbers, and the names - except that auto-recognition do them. <br>  - Unsorted list of contacts.  Its order is determined only by the sequence of adding / deleting elements. <br><br><br><h3>  extracurricular reading </h3><br>  Grandma's phone <br>  <a href="http://www.mobile-review.com/articles/2007/babushka.shtml">www.mobile-review.com/articles/2007/babushka.shtml</a> <br><br>  A phone for the elderly or old generation care <br>  <a href="http://www.mobile-review.com/articles/2003/old-people.shtml">www.mobile-review.com/articles/2003/old-people.shtml</a> <br><br>  A phone for seniors: attempt number three? <br>  <a href="http://www.mobile-review.com/articles/2009/mega-babushkophone.shtml">www.mobile-review.com/articles/2009/mega-babushkophone.shtml</a> <br><br>  Phone for the elderly: not only large buttons <br>  <a href="http://www.mobile-review.com/articles/2006/aged-people-phones.shtml">www.mobile-review.com/articles/2006/aged-people-phones.shtml</a> <br><br>  <font color="gray">Four links.</font>  <font color="gray">Did I miss the point ...</font> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/78478/">https://habr.com/ru/post/78478/</a></p>
