If the night did not sleep - during the day the head is buzzing, it is difficult to concentrate, it is practically impossible to work (I will <i>emphasize that hereinafter we are talking about intellectual work</i> ). <br><br>  But longer phases, the period of which is several months, are much more difficult to trace.  Although these phases are as real as the short-term phases. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a>

      So here.  Often in planning time these long phases are not considered.  A person naively believes that he will be equally productive throughout the whole year.  Those people who are just starting to plan their time on their own: freelancers, individual developers, and so on, fall into this ‚Äútrap‚Äù. <br><br>  Behind any active phase a period of ‚Äúinaction‚Äù begins.  The main symptoms of the fact that you have a period of inactivity: <br><ul><li>  Productivity drops significantly. </li><li>  The thought process slows down.  The ability to solve problems decreases (I think this can be confirmed by IQ tests).  Sometimes it's hard to remember a word. </li><li>  Lost interest in research, new directions. </li><li>  Difficult to concentrate, confused thoughts. </li><li>  After waking up, tiredness comes quickly (after 3-4 hours). </li></ul><br>  In this case, as they say in the people, you need a vacation. <br><br>  It is worth noting that human physiology in this matter does not correspond to the accepted public opinion: according to public opinion, leave is needed no more than once a year, regardless of the type of work, be it intellectual or physical labor.  If a person is not informed about this physiological property, he begins to think what is wrong with him, the poor thing, something is wrong and look for a problem in himself (worry about it).  Or, go on the rampage and through force try to force yourself to work (which can lead to insomnia, nervousness, depression, and even mental disorder). <br><br>  This is not the most interesting.  From my experience I noticed this: <br><ol><li>  The onset of a period of inactivity depends on the load during the period of work. </li><li>  Leaving the inactivity phase depends on the quality of rest. </li></ol><br>  Again, from my own experience, I can say that it is possible to work ‚Äúfor the whole coil‚Äù for a maximum of 2-2.5 months, after which a period of almost complete inactivity ensues. <br><br>  On the necessary rest.  If you rest actively (spend most of your time in nature, away from the company), then it takes about 1.5 months to recuperate.  With passive rest (more sleep, participation in forums, reading articles / news, watching movies + occasionally doing something) it will take up to 3 (!) Months to recuperate.  In any case, do not count on a quick recuperation: the process of rest is measured in months, but not in days. <br><br>  <b>What follows from this?</b> <br><ul><li>  When planning time for a project, keep in mind that your strength will run out after a certain time and you will need rest.  For how many months you have enough - depends on the health and activity of the work. </li><li>  If you do not have power over your time and you are required to work 8 hours every day - do not work at full strength (that is, ‚Äúshirk‚Äù to the extent possible) from work.  If you do not do this, then after a few months you will not be able to work physically (you can not endure until the holidays). </li></ul><br>  <b>Why am I writing all this?</b> <br><br>  After searching for information, I came to the conclusion that no serious research on this issue exists.  <i>I suggest in the comments to share my observations on these issues</i> : <br><ol><li>  How many months can you work continuously without a drop in productivity?  It is worth clarifying the percentage of daily workload (100% is when there is no longer any strength left to do anything else, just fall on the bed and sleep). </li><li>  How many months are enough for you to fully recover after a period of inactivity?  How does the quality of rest? </li></ol><br>  PS <br><br>  At this level of development of our civilization, it is considered that the best option for the ratio of work / rest is 11/1 (11 months of work and 1 month of rest).  This scheme is not confirmed by any kind of serious research.  It was formed historically for physical labor and was projected onto intellectual labor. <br><br>  I am convinced that the average person does not have enough strength to work intellectually to the fullest during all 11 months (even 8 hours a day).  Therefore, workers who are placed in such conditions are forced to ‚Äútake a shirk‚Äù in various ways (be it a smoke break, flames on the forums, reading articles, etc.). </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/118901/">https://habr.com/ru/post/118901/</a></p>
