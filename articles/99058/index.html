Communism has already arrived.

      The local river is occupied by after-school at school and by local girls - there are almost no boys.  Many people do not pay attention to swimsuits and other nonsense - they bathe and sunbathe topless or just in what the mother gave birth.  Look at me with meaningful looks. <br><br>  I bought five liters of milk in the store, I thought that they would ask that I had bought so much.  They asked why so little - usually take 10 liters at a time.  Bread is also bought here for five or six loaves.  In general, local people buy indecently many products - stew, some kind of sausage for ninety rubles a kilogram (I thought this does not exist at all).  All this does not fit well with local salaries - on average, they receive five to six thousand a month. <br><br>  There are two shops in the village - one sells groceries and the second one sells groceries and vodka.  The first works up to six, the second - up to 11. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  With the arrival of the night, spiders and alcoholics crawl out of the cracks - the first are waiting for the flies, and the second - the opening of the store. <br><br>  We have a terrible heat for the second week - the grass on the lawn has completely burned out and lies with yellow hay, all the other plants try to invigorate, but it turns out that they are weak.  Three or four more days like that and everything will start to bend over actively. <br><br>  The Internet in the village is as small as a pie after swimming in a river (sorry for the physiological features).  On average, an external GPRS-modem gives out 5-6 kilobits per second - you can work here only relatively.  The worst connection next to a telephone tower is a paradox worthy of great minds.  The best connection is at the cemetery (and don‚Äôt even ask where I know from). <br><br>  60 kilometers from the city and you are like on another planet - here the doors are not locked, but only propped up with a wand, the prices are three times lower, all people greet each other, it's dusty, stuffy and absolute siesta from 11 to 5 in the evening - work in this heat is impossible. <br><br>  An interesting observation is that the locals have an absolute sense of temperature.  Some offhand call the ambient temperature, some say the time and they say it.  The error is two or three degrees. <br><br>  It turns out that in our fields such small black hallucinogenic mushrooms grow - urban ones drive them on buses - such addict tours.  Local people do not eat these mushrooms - unfashionable and often get ‚Äúbad tripy‚Äù.  Now it is fashionable to dilute vodka with soda - a person is absolutely drunk even before he finishes a glass of such liquid. <br><br>  A neighbor gave me an ancient planer and a pile of Niva magazines for 1910 - she says she asked in time, because she had already burned almost "all this nonsense." <br><br>  In the forest, I was attacked by a healthy jay ‚Äî jumping on a pine tree around me ‚Äî terrible, with a gaping beak.  Interestingly, is it her heat? Does this mean that birds also have rabies? <br><br>  At three o'clock in the afternoon it is impossible to walk barefoot on the sand - it burns with terrible force.  Local go - they do not care.  They even walk barefoot in the forest - this is something impossible for me. <br><br>  I did not take a razor with me - I thought I would buy it here.  Three days were rich in events - everything was not up to it, therefore, it was heavily overgrown.  In the general store there are only machines for three rubles and foam for shaving in twenty - it looks so terrible that I spat and decided not to shave. <br><br>  Local people spend three rubles a day on the mobile Internet, and I spend 150. They looked at my macbook and iphone - they said that everything was uncomfortable and the topic for Windows was somehow strange.  Everyone has VKontakte - they almost don‚Äôt call each other by phone and do not write sms - VKontakte is cheaper. <br><br>  In the village there is a football field and two teams - the "old" and "youth."  In the second team, there are fewer and fewer people - the youth are leaving for the city. <br><br>  We are like in America - we all have cars - broken ocs and nines, without numbers and often without doors.  I personally saw how one of the cars broke down by a hit on some kind of barn - he got out of it and never came again - the car probably will rot there. <br><br>  In the ninth grade of the local school there are five students, in the tenth and three and in the eleventh three.  The first eight classes are gone. <br><br>  Here, seeing the army is a holiday - a striking difference from the city. <br><br>  Every second person has satellite television sets on their houses or just on neighboring fir trees, but no one is watching these 40+ channels - only the first and second. <br><br>  A neighbor through the house in his old age, married a young nurse - three days walking wedding.  On the fourth day the neighbor died - so the wedding gradually grew into a funeral, and the young wife became a widow.  Today was a funeral. <br><br>  Everyone in the attics and sheds have huge bottles of 30 liters each - in the Soviet years, there was a drying plant in the neighboring village.  When it was closed, the locals dragged them all off - cans, lids to cans, these bottles. <br><br>  On weekends, a station wagon or a minivan arrives in the village, people come out of them and lay out goods on cots, floats, Chinese slippers, fumigator ammunition and other nonsense.  It all looks like a Chinese counterfeit warehouse.  The same car comes with clothes. <br><br>  In the grocery store hanging sticky tape from flies.  It looks nauseous - a tape stuck to a black, swarming mass. <br><br>  In the next village there are five shops per thousand people.  It feels like half the village in these stores is working, and the other half is buying from them. <br><br>  Wired radio shut down, sad.  I liked how it used to broadcast something there to myself. <br><br>  Here, perhaps, all that came to mind. <br>  Have a good day! <br><br>  UPD.  Question to the audience - is it worth writing yet? </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/99058/">https://habr.com/ru/post/99058/</a></p>
