  <section class="page js-page"><h1>The first "soap dish" for 3D photos on sale since September for $ 600</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Fujifilm, a decade ago the former leader in the digital camera market (it now receives only 5% of its income from digital cameras, and specializes in professional equipment for medicine, cinema, etc.), has not yet lost its ambitions.  She tries to do everything in her own way, everywhere she uses unique technologies (for example, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_CCD">CCDs with hexagonal elements</a> are worth something!).  And now - the world's first amateur stereo camera, which will be on sale in two months. <br><br>  In terms of size and weight, the FinePix Real 3D System camera is comparable to an ordinary soap box.  The main difference is not one, but two lenses, which are approximately the same distance from each other as human eyes.  Inside the camera - two 10-megapixel sensor. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/f6d/66a/a85/f6d66aa857e07b4346da9be241a28c85.jpg">

      Lenses and sensors are controlled independently of each other, so that you can take a picture of an object at the same time with two focal lengths (in zoom and wide-angle version).  In addition, the lenses can be directed in different directions and make a super-wide panorama, which is glued automatically. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/efa/928/4c0/efa9284c07bda6d48ca7c77db89542b0.jpg"><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/4aa/914/34f/4aa91434f0e39493262d709fb616fced.jpg"><br><br>  The announcement of this model <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/the_future_is_here/43220/">took place</a> a year ago at Photokina, and now the date for the start of sales in Europe is <a href="http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1909457,00.html">announced</a> : September 2009.  In the Moscow office of Fujifilm, if you carefully ask, you can now take this model for testing. <br><br>  The cost of new items will be about $ 600. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/e5e/82b/911/e5e82b911cd784dec60636afab842106.jpg" align="right">  Since there are two lenses in the camera, recording a 3D image is a trivial task.  Another thing - viewing captured 3D-photos.  Fujifilm offers a special stereoplate with a diagonal of 20 cm (a couple hundred dollars) for this purpose. <br><br>  Alternatively, stereo images can be printed on transparent plastic with preservation of depth.  Such a printer is very expensive, you will not buy it at home, so the 3D printing service will work via the Internet (Fujifilm promises to launch in the near future).  Plastic cards with your photos will be sent by mail. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/637/715/8ae/6377158ae6428af445e01871c9fda798.jpg"><br><br>  Approximate estimates, each card will cost a few dollars.  Also expensive.  But here it makes sense to dump, because the future of mass 3D photography depends on the availability of printouts.  Fujifilm management is well aware that it is very important to offer low prices for this service. <br><br>  Fujifilm hopes that three-dimensional photos will become for people the same routine as now "flat" photo.  And then the company will regain its former leadership position.  Well, it is quite possible.  Personally, I know one person who is fanatically addicted to 3D photography and does his own hands constructing various devices to take 3D pictures, then he ‚Äústicks together‚Äù them on a computer (special programs are released for this).  For him, the appearance in the sale of the camera FinePix Real 3D System will probably be the main event of the year. <br><br>  As you know, in developed countries, sales of digital cameras have almost ceased to grow.  The market has reached saturation and clearly needs some kind of revolutionary technology that will force people to buy new digital cameras.  3D photography is great for the role of this new technology. <br><br>  Although, on the other hand, attempts to make a stereo camera with two lenses were made before, and they were not too successful.  For example, in the photo below - the ancient Kodak stereo camera. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/59e/615/891/59e615891e2f3d57a65030d3115e8a92.jpg"><br><br>  Even in the USSR, it seems, did something like that? </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/64929/">https://habr.com/ru/post/64929/</a></p>
