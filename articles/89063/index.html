    <h2>  Specification creation </h2><br><br>  Any tabular form in nanoCAD DPS is created using the advanced table editor.  An example of a table editor with a specification of exterior wall panels is shown in <i>Fig.</i>  <i>10</i> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/ae5/447/a91/ae5447a9171ebd882aaa44670fdb4de2.png" alt="nanoCAD SPDS"><br><br>  <i>Fig.</i>  <i>10. Table Editor</i> <br><br>  We will not dwell on the editor's functionality in detail.  Graphic formatting of cells resembles work in Microsoft Office applications.  Simple manipulations create a specification form with column names and headings.  Details should describe the linking of graphic data with the specification.  The specification itself in general form consists of two components - data and report.  The data is the values ‚Äã‚Äãentered by the user in the table editing mode.  A report is the output of certain properties from graphic objects attached to a tabular form.  For our task, it is necessary to attach wall panels to the specification and display a number of their properties in specific columns of the table.  Consider the mechanism for linking graphic data and tabular forms in more detail.  In the spreadsheet editor, a report section is created - an area where the properties of the panels placed on the drawing will be displayed.  This area will be located below the data area, where we describe the names of the columns and the title of the table.  In fig.  10, it is described by the report template, and the data itself is visible below in the report area.  When you create a report section in a table, the report template itself remains empty.  When you select the function of linking objects and a table, a form appears which is called <i>Quick Pick</i> .  It is presented in <i>Fig.</i>  <i>11</i> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/6b1/19f/0ec/6b119f0ec34754b2f790136049127059.png" alt="nanoCAD SPDS"><br><br>  <i>Fig.</i>  <i>11. Quick selection window for selecting drawing objects</i> <br><br>  Objects of the nanoCAD DPS database are represented as objects of the ‚ÄúStandard part‚Äù type.  It is necessary to choose this position among the whole multitude.  To clarify exactly which objects fall into the specification, it is possible to limit the scope of objects to search, as well as filter them by properties.  Opposite the desired property, you can select a logical operator from the drop-down list in the <i>Condition</i> column.  In <i>fig.</i>  <i>11,</i> this feature is shown for the <i>Name</i> property.  After that, the options found in the drawing will be proposed in the <i>Value</i> column.  Thus, nanoCAD SPDS allows very flexible control of the search area of ‚Äã‚Äãobjects, their type and properties for communication with the specification.  In our example, all panels that do not contain the mark ‚ÄúB‚Äù in the brand name will be included in the specification, since this is a specification for exterior panels only.  nanoCAD SPDS allows selecting several types of various objects within one sample.  After setting the necessary conditions, you can select another type of object in the same window, as well as save the filter conditions in the templates. <br><br>  After the objects are assigned, it remains only to distribute the properties of the objects in the specification columns, where they will be displayed on the drawing.  To do this, just call the context menu on the desired cell of the report template.  In <i>fig.</i>  <i>12</i> shows a fragment of a menu with a number of properties of wall panels attached to the table.  For this column, select the number of the project. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/86d/c75/e85/86dc75e8542765e24801223d92200b1d.png" alt="nanoCAD SPDS"><br><br>  <i>Fig.</i>  <i>12. Selection of properties of attached objects from the context menu</i> <br><br>  nanoCAD SPDS allows not only the flexibility to customize the tabular form of any complexity, but also to output arbitrary properties of objects attached to the table, by pre-filtering properties.  Further data processing allows you to combine and group specification lines.  The formulation of the problem indicated that identical panel brands should have a unique number for the project.  This is only possible when grouping rows with the same stamps.  All identical brands of panels are collected in one line of the specification, after which they can be assigned a single number for the project.  It is assigned by the designer after placing the panels on the plans.  In the report section properties, the <i>Group and merge</i> function is called.  An example of a dialog box for it can be seen in <i>Fig.</i>  <i>13</i> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/b91/3bb/edf/b913bbedfc4bd113b54ba5dbff1d0785.png" alt="nanoCAD SPDS"><br><br>  <i>Fig.</i>  <i>13. Grouping and combining data in a table</i> <br><br>  The principle of operation is very simple.  First, the data is sorted in ascending order in column ‚ÄúA‚Äù.  Column "A" contains the numbers for the project.  Then we group the rows in column ‚ÄúB‚Äù without sorting.  This is the connection of all identical panels in one line, since the "B" column contains the full name of the panel by album.  This name is made up of the brand of the panel and the brand of concrete: for example, "H-200 uklev (20)".  Here we see another possibility nanoCAD SPDS - combine two properties of an object into one value.  Note also that in the cells of the nanoCAD SPDS table, you can write entire expressions, both mathematical and logical.  For example, when counting the number of panels belonging to a specific section of a building, only the panels with the corresponding section number are listed in the indicated cells in the cells.  This process is provided with a logical expression.  The total column ‚ÄúTotal‚Äù counts the total number of panels for all sections for a given brand.  In the remaining columns, other panel properties are displayed.  In <i>fig.</i>  <i>14</i> shows an example specification for exterior wall panels in three sections of a building.  The finished template contains the maximum number of sections - 15. When placing a specification, unnecessary columns can be hidden.  This allows you to use a single table template for any number of sections. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/d98/4d1/554/d984d15549b68012b1f118cfdfe40a11.png" alt="nanoCAD SPDS"><br><br>  <i>Fig.</i>  <i>14. Example Specification for Exterior Wall Panels</i> <br><br><h2>  Marking panels on the drawing </h2><br>  After setting up the panels and creating the specification, it remains to solve the problem of marking the wall panels and assigning an individual design number to identical panels, in which the grades and class of concrete match.  In our specification, such panels are combined into a single line in the ‚ÄúTitle by Album‚Äù position.  The nanoCAD database contains standard markers with which you can display certain properties or assign serial numbers to each object, as well as perform a number of other operations.  For our case, a non-standard version was again obtained, which significantly complicated the development of the marker.  In the formulation of the problem it was stated that in the absence of a project number, the marker should display the panel name by album.  The customer wished to provide the ability to arbitrarily assign the numbers for the project to the designer himself, although this function could be automated.  And to visually identify the panel in the drawing, the designer needs to see the panel name by album.  Recall that this is a mix of brand name and concrete class.  When assigning a number, the marker should display this number without interchanging the marker itself, that is, changing its value dynamically.  With the involvement of logical expressions in the properties of the marker, all this is quite within the power of nanoCAD SPDS.  In <i>fig.</i>  <i>15</i> presents a window with a description of the attributes of the marker. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/37c/51c/f8c/37c51cf8c1e2cf9ce7cce31a598f43aa.png" alt="nanoCAD SPDS"><br><br>  <i>Fig.</i>  <i>15. Marker Properties Window</i> <br><br>  A marker is assigned to each panel individually.  It takes the values ‚Äã‚Äãof the number according to the project, the brand of the panel and the brand of concrete.  The logical expression assigns the name of the marker to the album (brand and concrete) in the absence of the project number, or assigns the number itself when it is assigned to this panel.  The reverse is also true: if you remove a number, the name of the album is returned, which is very convenient to change the mistakenly assigned numbers if necessary.  The assignment of project numbers is carried out through the properties of the panels.  To select all panels in the drawing according to certain criteria, a filter similar to that shown in <i>Fig. 2 is used.</i>  <i>11</i> filter for binding objects and specifications.  After assignment of numbers, they are dynamically displayed in the markers and the corresponding specification line. <br><br><h2>  Summary </h2><br>  Analyzing the results of the work done, it is safe to say that nanoCAD SPDS is capable of solving problems that are much broader than the simple automation of drawing design.  As we have seen, it is possible to create a database object that is given arbitrary properties when placed on a drawing.  All information about the object is visually presented to the designer, and he can unambiguously determine the necessary panel from the base.  After setting it is always possible to change the properties of the panel without redrawing it.  Marking contributes to the visual definition of objects in the drawing, since it is impossible to understand the brand of the panel from the schematic display in the plan.  The specification automatically counts the number of panels by section and generally within one line.  It can be dynamically linked to the data in the drawing and never lose relevance.  In <i>fig.</i>  <i>16</i> shows an example of a fragment of a drawing with three panels placed (marked with blue) and one of them editing window. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/b6c/1bc/e8f/b6c1bce8f1c87cf5774f9d9f2a64f638.png" alt="nanoCAD SPDS"><br><br>  <i>Fig.</i>  <i>16. An example of a fragment of the drawing with the placement of panels</i> <br><br>  Solving such a local problem shows that developing your own database can significantly increase the level of automation in a construction company, while eliminating the need to purchase expensive specialized software.  In turn, this gives a significant gain in productivity and quality of preparation of project documentation. <br><br>  Alexey Tsvetkov, Tsvetkov@nanocad.ru </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/89063/">https://habr.com/ru/post/89063/</a></p>
