  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Be Organized With Things</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Probably everybody comes to the conclusion that it would be nice to become a little organized and have time to do as many cases as possible in a day.  I came to this thought when I realized that I was wasting a very large amount of my time.  I tried a large number of programs for doing To-Do, organizers and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Getting_Things_Done">Getting-Things-Done-</a> systems.  Tried to keep a list of important things for the day in <a href="http://hyalineskies.com/2006/11/hacking-a-gtd-moleskine">moleskine</a> .  But each time I came across difficulty in mastering, and, therefore, in use in daily work.  This happened again and again until a wonderful program called <a href="http://culturedcode.com/things">Things</a> caught my eye. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  It was then that I felt what I missed all this time.  By and large, Things makes it easy to keep a list of all the necessary cases, like many other programs.  But what really sets Things apart from all such programs is elegance and ease of use.  It is elegance and simplicity.  To start working productively, you don’t need to watch countless screencasts or read the manual.  No you countless settings of columns and filters.  The main (and only) window of the program is made in the style of Mail and iTunes: a list of projects and areas on the left and a workspace on the right. <img src="http://haywired.ru/upload/images/things/main.png" alt=" " title="Working window">  As we see, on the left we have “Inbox”, where all the tasks that you don’t know how to proceed are added.  If you decide that the task needs to be solved exactly today, then it is sent to the “Today” section.  If the task is not so urgent, then place it in the “Next” section.  There are two more sections left: “Someday” (“Someday”) and “Scheduled” (“Scheduled”).  I especially like the “Someday” section, where I bring in something that is not very important in the near future, but I would still like to do it.  For example, there you can bring "Learn Spanish" or "Buy a shirt", you know what I mean.  In “Scheduled”, the cases that need to be completed up to a certain time are entered. In addition to the four sections listed, your cases and tasks can be defined in “Projects” (“Projects”) or “Areas” (“Areas”).  The screenshot shows that I have “Haywired” in “Projects”, where all the tasks related to the blog fall into, and in “Areas” I have “Design / Illustration” and “Freelance”, where I bring all the cases related to to this area of ​​my work.  In Things, you do not need to enter any metadata imposed on you, such as “Efforts”, “Priority” and others, as is customary in many GTD systems.  Instead, Things has an advanced tree tag system.  Use as much meta data as you need, or don't use it at all.  All used tags are displayed on top.  If you select one or more tags, your affairs will be instantly filtered by the selected tags.  Personally, I use temporary contexts (“5 min”, “15 min”, ...), importance (“low”, “medium”, “high”) and some others. <img src="http://haywired.ru/upload/images/things/tags.png" alt="" title="Tags">  Another nice addition is the input window, called by the global hot key, by pressing which you can quickly enter a new task.  In the window you can also drag a link or text from Safari, or correspondence from Adium and Mail. <img src="http://haywired.ru/upload/images/things/quickentry.png" alt="  " title="Quick entry window">  In order to work more productively, I do not want to play according to rigidly established rules and master complex programs.  I don't want to mess with filters.  I don’t want to endlessly sort the columns “Location”, “Time” and so on, as the <a href="http://www.omnigroup.com/applications/omnifocus">OmniFocus</a> developers conceived.  In Things, tasks look like a simple string with a title and a check box.  Everything else is secondary: if you do not enter tags, a description or a date, then you will not see them.  In OmniFocus, empty columns only introduce confusion and confusion.  The task manager should dissolve in the background and not impersonate.  Things does this perfectly well.  Point. <br><br>  This article is part of my blog <a href="http://haywired.ru/">Haywired.ru</a> .  By and large, this is a blog about everything that happens in the world of Apple, but we are not limited to this.  We do not translate numerous articles that are useless in Russian realities from English-speaking sources (and some do it, and ineptly), we write our own.  Mac users for Mac users.  I believe that Haywired is one of the few author blogs on this topic.  The blog team is <a href="http://haywired.ru/about">two diverse people</a> who have an opinion, not an AppleInsider or MacRumors opinion.  We will only be happy if you become our regular reader. <br></div>
