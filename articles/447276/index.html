  <section class="page js-page"><h1>What is ITIL library and why does your company need it</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  The rapid growth of the importance of information technology for business requires more and more attention to the organization and implementation of the provision of IT services.  Today information technologies are used not only to solve local problems in an organization, they are also involved in the development of its business strategy.  The importance of these tasks required the development of a fundamentally new approach to the problem of systematization of accumulated information.  For these purposes, an ITIL library has been created, describing best practices in the provision of IT services.  Thus, IT specialists were able to use the best practices in their work, improving the quality of service. <br><br><img src="https://i.ibb.co/0QkNQtP/itil.jpg" alt="image"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h3>  Why do you need it? </h3><br>  Every year information technology (IT) plays an increasingly important role in business.  IT allows organizations to be competitive, as they provide tools to help collect, process, store and analyze large amounts of information for further business decision making.  Those companies that have better information technology, and show the best results, as they have a competitive advantage in the form of a tool that allows you to use the available data to maximize benefits.  Thus, IT is a means of improving the efficiency of the entire organization. <br><br>  For several decades, business informatization has played an increasingly important role in the effective functioning of companies.  At various stages of IT existence, many attempts were made to use them in business processes, and not all of them were effective.  So there was a need to accumulate world experience in using IT in running a business, which was eventually realized as an ITIL library containing a methodology for managing and improving business processes related to IT.  The ITIL library can be used both by companies providing IT services and individual departments of companies of other profiles that provide IT work for the entire organization.  ITIL guides are used in this approach to managing and organizing IT services like ITSM.

    <h3>  What is ITIL </h3><br>  The IT infrastructure library (ITIL library) or the Information Technology Infrastructure Library is a series of books containing a set of tutorials on how to manage, debug, and continually improve IT-related business processes. <br><br>  The first edition of the library was commissioned by the British government in 1986-1989, and began to be published in 1992, and the last, third version, ITIL V3, was published in 2007.  The latest edition of the library, published in 2011, consists of 5 volumes.  At the beginning of 2019, the forerunner of the fourth version of the V4 library came out, the full version of which the developer AXELOS will release in about a year. <br><br><h3>  The structure and content of the library ITIL </h3><br>  In the development of the third edition, a new approach to the formation of its content, the so-called ‚Äúservice life cycle‚Äù, was used.  Its essence is that each library volume focuses on a specific phase of the ‚Äúlife cycle‚Äù.  Since there are five phases of this cycle, according to ITIL, there are also five books: <br><br><ul><li>  Service Strategy; </li><li>  Service Design; </li><li>  Service Transition; </li><li>  Service Operation; </li><li>  Continuous Service Improvement. </li></ul><br><img src="https://i.ibb.co/9nspJHP/Screenshot-2.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  The first phase of the Service Strategy helps the business to understand who its target audience is, what their needs are, and, therefore, what services they need, what equipment they need to provide these services, and development of requirements for their implementation.  Also, as part of the Service Strategy, work is constantly being adjusted to see if the price of the service is in line with the values ‚Äã‚Äãthat the client can receive from this service. <br><br>  The next step is the service design phase, which allows you to ensure that the service fully meets customer expectations. <br><br>  The Transformation Services phase is responsible for the production and successful implementation of the services required by the client.  Testing, quality control, product sales, etc. take place at this level. <br><br>  This is followed by the Operation of services, in which there is a systematic production of services, the work of a support service to solve local problems, the accumulation of a database of similar problems to further improve the quality of service provision. <br><br>  The final phase is Continuous Improvement of Services, responsible for changes and improvements at all stages of the production of the service and for the efficiency of all the processes of the organization. <br><br>  These five phases are the skeleton of a service life cycle structure, key concepts that can be operated in the context of the ITIL library. <br><br>  Each phase (and, accordingly, the book) covers various aspects of business management.  Examples include demand management, financial management in the field of IT services, supply chain management and many others. <br><br><h3>  Principles of using the library ITIL </h3><br>  Since ITIL is one of the key points when applying such an approach as ITSM in business management, the basic principles of using the library follow from the philosophy of ITSM.  The main idea of ‚Äã‚Äãthe ITSM approach is to shift the focus of attention from technology to the services provided.  The ITSM approach suggests that instead of technology, the organization should focus on customers and services.  Thus, a business needs to focus on what opportunities and results of technology can give a client, what values ‚Äã‚Äãa business is able to create, how a business can be improved. <br><br>  The ten key principles taken from the ITIL Practitioner Guidance guide, sponsored by Kaimar Karu and other library developers, are listed below: <br><br><ul><li>  Focus on values; </li><li>  Design for practice; </li><li>  Start from where you are now; </li><li>  Come to work holistically; </li><li>  Move forward iteratively; </li><li>  Watch the processes directly; </li><li>  Be transparent; </li><li>  Interact; </li><li>  The main principle: simplicity; </li><li>  Apply these principles in practice. </li></ul><br>  It can be concluded that these principles, which are key for ITIL, can be applied in one form or another with other approaches and methodologies in business management, product development, etc.  (Lean, agile and others), which only confirms that these principles work.  Since the library ITIL has a long-term experience of many organizations, these principles have become the basis for the effective operation of the business. <br><br>  Since these principles are relatively non-specific, they, as a tool, have such quality as flexibility.  One of the main points when working with ITIL is: ‚ÄúAdopt and adapt‚Äù, that is, ‚ÄúAccept and adapt‚Äù. <br><br>  ‚ÄúAccept‚Äù means the adoption by the business of the ITIL philosophy, shifting the focus to customers and services.  The thesis ‚ÄúFit‚Äù implies a thoughtful use of the best ITIL practices and their adaptation to the needs of a particular business. <br><br>  Thus, adherence to an approach compatible with ITIL principles, using library guidelines, can change and significantly improve various organization processes. <br><br><h3>  So conclusions </h3><br>  ITIL uses a new approach to the development and provision of IT services, which considers the life cycle of IT services as a whole.  This systematic approach to managing IT services allows businesses to make the best use of the opportunities provided by the ITIL library: manage risks, develop a product, improve relationships with customers, optimize costs, speed up processes, increase the number of services, thanks to competent development of the IT environment. <br><br>  Since business conditions are constantly changing, ITIL must also be changed and improved to best meet all the requirements put forward by the modern world.  In early 2019, the release of the new version of the ITIL library is planned, and the application of its manuals in practice will show in which direction the business and its processes will develop further. <br><br><h3>  Literature </h3><br>  Cartlidge A., Chakravarthy J., Rudd C., Sowerby JA Operational Support and Analysis ITIL Intermediate Capability Handbook.  - London, TSO, 2013. - 179 p. <br>  Karu K.
