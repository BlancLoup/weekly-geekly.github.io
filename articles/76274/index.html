      The box with headphones is slightly larger than the box from audio cassettes - the headphones themselves and 2 pairs of silicone ear cushions are fixed in solid foam rubber (S and L; one more pair, M, is worn on the headphones initially). <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/1b8/751/082/1b8751082791f7acaf421720eeea7367.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Behind this form there is a cover on strings, pieces of paper for use and a meter extension - a nice bonus if you take into account the length of the Y-shaped ears at 0.6 meters.  On the adapter, by the way, L-shaped connector. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/0d3/f59/739/0d3f5973983a076ee5d610df9d32a910.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  The design of the headphone is simple as the world, however, there are nuances.  The elongated straight ‚Äúcups‚Äù (on which the logo is applied) are made of titanium - I see the reliability of this metal every day with the example of a ring and a case for a flash drive.  Due to this, holding the wire there is a pleasant "weight" of the headphones, however, they are not heavy - the total weight is only 5 grams.  In general, all this looks very attractive and inspires confidence (I don‚Äôt even want to touch some plastic plugs). <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/aa1/8f8/d4b/aa18f8d4b0d04ece96ade16eedd16a8c.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  There were no cracking frosts yet, so it was not possible to evaluate the wires to a ‚Äúfull coil‚Äù.  But at -5 they remained bendable, not dubey.  I prefer not to carry out crash tests with lightning jackets, but in this case (as in all the others), I pinch the wire a couple of times - without consequences. <br><br><h2>  Inside </h2><br>  In the ears, the headphones are held securely - even on the largest nozzle there is no discomfort, the ears do not hurt after a long time.  Light morning jogging or jumping through the turnstiles in the subway is easy.  Almost all the time I listened to those seals that were put on initially - they had a pretty good tightness. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/5ed/d9e/f81/5edd9ef81ca2a95f8115a7ee8486c1dc.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  The sound insulation is average - some of the sounds from the ‚Äúoutside‚Äù disappear, but you will definitely hear the approaching train in the subway.  However, it is quite comfortable to listen at medium volume.  By the way, I listened only on two players - Cowon D2 + and Cowon S9 (mainly on the BBE Headphone 2 preset). <br><br>  The sound of the headphones, most likely, will be quite unusual for almost all music lovers - not only those who are used to the usual dynamic plugs, but also connoisseurs of fittings. <br>  On the one hand, the ‚Äúreinforcement‚Äù detail has not disappeared anywhere and is fully present - musical instruments do not merge into one pile, ‚Äúsounding‚Äù distinctly and separately.  On the other hand, the disadvantage inherent in almost all valves - compression of sound information - is almost absent here.  The sound is ‚Äúlively‚Äù and dynamic - the quiet overtones on the recordings do not tend to come out on par with the main characters of the musical narration, while the peak signals ‚Äúbreathe‚Äù in full force, and do not quietly stop at a certain limit.  That is, in this key with headphones everything is OK.  But there is no perfection in the world, and SCM90 does not even strive to become it, remaining only just good reinforcing headphones.  IMHO, their main problem is a very uneven tonal balance. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/deb/8f8/ed7/deb8f8ed713c3e2b5df47f3e2de0219f.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  A very overestimated level of bass, as well as the lowest part of the mid frequencies, is adjacent to the failed middle and ambiguously demonstrated high frequencies. <br>  Being already somewhat familiar with the sound of different headphones (and I heard, by the way, there is still not so much of everything), I was somewhat surprised with the SKM90 model.  Each company almost always has some kind of signature style - Audio-Technika has so far demonstrated a smooth and bright sound.  And the SCM90 looks like a bit of a black sheep compared to other headphones from this company) <br><br>  But, again, the ears act out well and generally left positive emotions. <br><br><h2>  Its cockroaches </h2><br>  By the way, during the time of use I managed to reveal the following trifle - since  I usually wear a player in my trouser pocket, then you can only listen through an extension cord (because the headphones themselves are only 60cm long), and he, in turn, is unreasonably long (1m) and has an L-shaped plug at the end.  For the same S9, a straight connector is preferable (if you put the player in your trouser pocket upside down, then the wire will not bend), while for D2 + L-shaped is more convenient (because the player was horizontal and straight in the pocket bent, which will adversely affect the survivability of the plug). <br>  In view of the fact that I prefer the S9 (for ease of operation), I first wound an extension cord on the player, and then completely abandoned it and listened from the inside pocket of my jacket.  So the problem ‚Äúeither listen from the breast pocket or from the belt, or wind the extension cord and listen where you want‚Äù is the place to be.  Trifle, but the sediment remained) <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/026/d60/e1f/026d60e1fca282fc92a5eaca9fbddfd1.png" alt="image"><br><br><h2>  Weighing </h2><br>  <u>pros</u> <br>  - Durable titanium headphone case; <br>  - Extension (1 m) and replaceable ear cushions (3 pairs) included; <br>  - Reliable fit in the ear + no discomfort during prolonged wear; <br>  - High-quality sound with some reservations. <br><br>  <u>Minuses</u> <br>  - Short Y-shaped wire (60 cm); <br>  - Average sound insulation; <br>  - High price. <br><br>  By the way, which rebar headphones are cheap and play the full range?  ) <br>  As for the price, in <a href="">Yandex.Market</a> it lies in the range from 5086 to 7050 rubles, but on average it is 5200. Sold in 7 places, and all are located in Moscow. <br><br>  Price dynamics: <br><img src="http://pricechart-gen.yandex.net/1258923600/?id=4608010&amp;reg=3" alt="image"><br><h6>  * - The graph of the average price for a model is calculated on the basis of all product offers of stores placed on the Market for the last six months and delivering goods to the specified region. </h6><br><h2>  A curtain </h2><br>  First, headphones bribed their reliability.  Then - unpretentious behavior, being in the ears.  Then ... they created double feelings - joy for melodious tracks (and for some, even pride) and almost complete disappointment from dynamic tracks with deep bass.  Oh, and I wanted to listen to all the music, flooded on the player ...) <br><br>  Therefore, headphones can be adopted by lovers of instrumental compositions, as well as simply melodic musical directions.  Well and that musical material in which vocals dominate.  Lovers of electronic music (especially the bassist), as well as all kinds of "gravity", these headphones are not the best choice. <br><br>  Everyone's ears and ears are different, so I won't advise anything to anyone.  More precisely, I will - it is best to walk to the store and listen on your own, as close as possible to the conditions in which you will listen further (player, music).  Only in this way can you really buy what you want. <br>  And next time I‚Äôll tell you about <b>Audio-Technica ATH-AD1000</b> monitor headphones - you can talk a lot about them, but the most pleasant thing is to listen;) <br><br>  During the tests, no living ear was harmed.
