  <section class="page js-page"><h1>IconBIT NETTAB THOR IZ Tablet Review: When Intel Inside</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  The iconBIT NETTAB THOR IZ tablet has at least two features that I would like to highlight in the introduction.  First, an interesting screen diagonal of 8.9 inches is another confirmation of the maximum expansion of the choice of ‚Äútablets‚Äù on the display diagonal.  Secondly, the tablet uses an Intel Atom Z2580 processor, which automatically attracts an increase in the attention of at least the technically competent part of the population.  Therefore, ‚Äúhaving talked‚Äù with iconBIT NETTAB THOR IZ for about a week, I hasten to share my impressions. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/51c/f64/a74/51cf64a743e32f93bbc3ef3847ae7b93.jpg"><a name="habracut"></a><br><br><h4>  Packing and packaging </h4><br>  The box is standard for brand devices - a couple of basic characteristics on the front side, plus a colorful print of the tablet itself.  From the rear - a detailed acquaintance with the parameters, and along with the buttons / connectors of the device.

I would like to see the OTG cable, which I regularly met in other tablets of the iconBIT THOR series. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/78c/8f7/62f/78c8f762fcae3a3b7928dd95d7e9d485.jpg"><br><br><h4>  Design </h4><br>  Appearance, or rather the dimensions of the tablet, once again made me think about the golden mean between home and mobile tablet device.  It seems to me that 7.9 inch models fall better under this ‚Äúhybridity‚Äù, but iconBIT NETTAB THOR IZ also carefully positions itself on both fronts.  I liked the design that was not hackneyed for tablets.  Despite the fact that brands try to diversify the appearance of their devices, with more it turns out very badly.  And here - "chotky" tablet with an abundance of right angles at the joints of the sides.  Most of all iconBIT NETTAB THOR IZ reminded me of a large, very large iPhone. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/ac5/095/b7f/ac5095b7fc49b711f678a440842a2415.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/c62/192/a36/c62192a36a44aa49c3822391d2fa8d63.jpg"><br><br>  Attractive design model was a continuation of its controversial ergonomics.  I specifically drew as independent opinions two colleagues who normally appreciated the ability to work with the device.  However, I was too used to smooth transitions, the sharp edges of the tablet were very conspicuous to me (more precisely, the palms).  Although I do not think that the average consumer will pay attention to this moment at all.  The tablet can be held with one hand, but still it‚Äôs not some iconBIT NETTAB SKAT MX "in the style" of the iPad Mini. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/ab1/b2d/d58/ab1b2dd58320f3a096f461e5381d1118.jpg"><br><br>  Materials iconBIT NETTAB THOR IZ is not that premium, but the metal frame is used at the ends.  Honestly, in principle, I don‚Äôt like the metal in the ‚Äúgrasping‚Äù places in mobile devices, but as practice shows, 99% of other users meet this with a bang.  The front and the front side of the model are white, which harmoniously combines with metal elements and a black stripe-insert on the sides.  Marcos is low, on a white background, fingerprints are almost invisible.  Although if you look at a certain angle, you immediately run after the ‚Äúrubbing tools‚Äù. <br><br>  Now a little more about the elements-buttons-connectors.  On the front side there is only a single eye of the camera, the control buttons are customarily concentrated directly on the screen in the system. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/196/4d0/17f/1964d017f5a9c2eac567b9ac1d993835.jpg"><br><br>  From the rear is exactly the same "diversity", only it is supplemented with inscriptions, including the indication of the presence of an Intel processor. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/4f8/2df/30e/4f82df30e7ecfe5eef498734d89eff9c.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/4ce/381/f60/4ce381f60ebf18ee9127aa5397118c88.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/2bb/99d/54a/2bb99d54aec006f78c7cac2c4f3e7990.jpg"><br><br>  On the left side - audio output, microUSB connector and speaker.  It is not difficult to guess that the second speaker is on the opposite side.  Immediately, I note that the sound volume is decent, in the room I almost never set more than 30-40% of the maximum.  That would have to install the speakers a little higher, so that they do not overlap in landscape orientation with your hands.  By the way, I was very surprised by the lack of HDMI connector. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/2b9/b31/223/2b9b31223230ba4f3f3d5d3917a753ad.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/c1d/542/196/c1d5421966ff3f03c9db6bc886102a13.jpg"><br><br>  The memory card slot is mounted on the top, next to the microphone. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/489/3c9/695/4893c96950f0f6275c886c710d3693f8.jpg"><br><br>  All three keys (power and volume) are at the top left.  I really liked this against the background of other models, when both elements are spread to the most unexpected places of the case.  And we are not talking about convenience in different orientations.  And here - in the portrait position, everything is under the right hand (almost like in a smartphone), in the landscape one - exactly under the left.  "Sit" buttons without backlash. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/959/bae/ed9/959baeed95fe8f106a23bf9ffbee659a.jpg"><br><br><h4>  Screen </h4><br>  If my memory serves me, this is the third iconBIT tablet in my hands.  And I am always glad that the quality of the matrix of questions does not arise.  However, more on that later.  The display diagonal is 8.9 inches.  The resolution is 1 920 x 1 200 pixels.  It is clear that so iconBIT NETTAB THOR IZ has a higher PPI compared to 10-inch tablets.  As a consequence, I don‚Äôt see the point of dwelling on obvious epithets like ‚Äúclear‚Äù, ‚Äúsmooth‚Äù and others in relation to the image. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/cbc/c3b/7be/cbcc3b7be868f08ef5b61416d750a9b8.jpg"><br><br>  The display backlighting is even, in color reproduction and viewing angles, perhaps, I will not say anything unexpected - the picture is rich, but there is no obvious misinterpretation, but you can watch anything together or threesome without problems.  In any case, my wife and I didn‚Äôt have to roll the tablet for mutually optimal angles.  The margins of protective glass do not go beyond reasonable limits - here I don‚Äôt see much of a difference with almost any tablet without an oleophobic coating. <br><br><h4>  Camera </h4><br>  The main 5 megapixel and an additional 2 megapixel camera - more than the standard set.  If I'm not mistaken, the shooting program is taken from Android in unchanged form along with the interface in the style of ultimate minimalism.  There are almost no additional settings, which is logical due to the lack of a special claim on the artistic quality of the 5 Mp module. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/7ad/d1e/a08/7add1ea08d968310cbfb00c3ba085047.png"><br><br>  If we remember that we are talking about the camera of the tablet, I would give it 7 out of 10 points.  There is a shortage of color saturation and contrast, but in general, I expected a much less acceptable result.  The camera does not hyster exposure in frames with a sharp transition of dark and light areas, and in the shadows there is no excessive (again, comparable to other tablets) digital noise.  I even got shots with good clarity at a distance of 15-20 cm from the object. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/c54/7f8/06e/c547f806e77bdb4eb2cd3946c9a4dd0a.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/1de/fe4/131/1defe41319f567b1956691f4bf7ffb24.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/c05/3fc/a14/c053fca14b92078374ae0ba09c46d933.jpg"><br><br><h4>  Performance </h4><br>  One of the most interesting components of a smartphone is its Intel Atom Z2580 processor (Clover Trail +).  Just in case, let me remind you that this processor was the first Intel model with a 32 nm process technology.  The dual-core Intel Atom Z2580 operates at a frequency of 2 GHz, that is, at the maximum possible for this model.  There is support for Hyper-Threading, Intel Smart Idle and Intel Image Signal Processor.  In the presence of a dual-channel 32-bit controller RAM LPDDR2 frequency of 533 MHz.  The graphics accelerator is an eight-core PowerVR SGX 544MP2 with a frequency of 533 MHz.  RAM - 2 GB, all "in an adult".  The internal memory for data is 16 GB, this should be enough for most users. <br><br>  Intel Atom Z2580 is a flagship processor, so I expected the corresponding results from it.  Almost 20,000 points in AnTutu, 57.3 FPS in Epic Citadel (yes, there's graphics here, but still), you see the rest.  Very good, a good example of a tablet that is relevant in the light of the current resource-intensive programs, games and popular multitasking. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/d92/753/a2c/d92753a2c3105e4c188f96a0dbaad8a4.png"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/a42/37f/9b6/a4237f9b681613ef70f0c18188c72bd7.png"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/06d/960/455/06d960455e937e1bd24dea7e7a9dacc2.png"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/3fc/18e/346/3fc18e3469c1aa01f18075806d17223a.png"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/451/a49/518/451a495189053224442f705f5a2a18a4.png"><br><br>  Only here is one thing - the results in the benchmarks above are good, but not too advanced advances based on Rockchip RK3188.  But 3DMark revealed the potential of the tablet to the fullest extent, 7 138 points - it is an order of magnitude more than in tablets with ‚Äúrock‚Äù. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/db4/45c/887/db445c88753ef57c3f852281b6796617.png"><br><br>  I didn‚Äôt have any problems with games, if we talk about titles downloaded from Google Play like Dead Trigger 2, Riptide GP2 installed from a single APK file also worked fine.  But when I tried to use pre-prepared cache sets (my own ‚Äúbrowser setter‚Äù), the incompatibility revealed almost total.  I use my set mainly with MTK devices, but mostly universal cache was downloaded.  In an amicable way, you need to spend some time searching for options with the best compatibility, but again, if you choose ‚Äúfull‚Äù download from Google Play, I did not observe any flights. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/779/1dd/63e/7791dd63e6441802595fc2fa25da9404.png"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/da2/af0/2e5/da2af02e5f9d58e4d2cc5326cb894be7.png"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/67e/e76/15a/67ee7615ad36f0779794f068c946cfc3.png"><br><br>  Usually, I use the IXBT technique to test the video playback, but this time the site has already seen a ‚Äúsubject‚Äù review.  Therefore, here (http://www.ixbt.com/portopc/iconbit-thor-iz.shtml), you can familiarize yourself with checking the playback of videos.  Supporting the author of the material, without Intel's codec pack, can hardly call iconBIT NETTAB THOR IZ an ‚Äúomnivorous‚Äù tablet. <br><br>  Given that there are no grandiose innovations in the system, I will give its description here.  The current Android 4.2.2 is installed, the set of programs is completely standard.  I rather welcome it, because I don‚Äôt feel much at all about the cluttering up of memory by all Odnoklassniki, Mail.ru clients and all sorts of variations on the subject of Yandex.Chto something. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/cf7/f21/7ff/cf7f217ff1383d456cd2a1f24c3092a1.png"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/87d/3fd/3c3/87d3fd3c3424076fa8f2d41dbbcb40f8.png"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/b96/4ab/688/b964ab688b29b7edccc5c68a6f8fd415.png"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/504/81f/32a/50481f32ac85211f0f20f211fd121f53.png"><br><br><h4>  Autonomous work </h4><br>  A 7,000 mAh battery seems like a good choice considering the diagonal and tablet processor.  According to my measurements, iconBIT NETTAB THOR IZ can withstand 5 hours and 50 minutes in 3D games (Dead Trigger 2, maximum graphics settings), 9 hours and 10 minutes Wi-Fi web surfing and 7 hours and 30 minutes when playing HD movies (maximum volume, average brightness).  The tests were carried out by me right at the time of business trips, because these figures came in very handy.  Especially against the background of my Acer Extensa 5220, which surprisingly discharged an external battery with a capacity of 12,000 mAh in exactly one hour. <br><br><h4>  Conclusion </h4><br>  An extremely interesting tablet, which I would highly recommend to consider if 8 inches for you is not enough, but 10 inches seems too cumbersome.  Intel Atom Z2580 turned out to be not at all a purely ‚Äúgeeky‚Äù parameter - I liked the processor with low power consumption along with the ability to ‚Äúgive heat‚Äù in 3D games (if there are no problems with the cache).  The appearance of the device is not that super-original, but it noticeably diversifies retail shelves filled up with black ‚Äúpills‚Äù.  Of the minuses - there is no support for HDMI, which is critical if you intend to use the tablet with a TV.  The conditional disadvantages will take the lack of GPS and 3G.  For me, both options are a reality of smartphones, which are already present in almost everyone they meet.  The device costs 9,990 rubles (~ $ 312) and should go on sale in mid-December. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/206668/">https://habr.com/ru/post/206668/</a></p>
