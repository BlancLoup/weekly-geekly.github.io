  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Free and Open Source Software SEDs</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"> In connection with the active development of software solutions to many pressing problems in the field of IT technologies, which are currently widely used in various fields of activity, first of all, in such important ones as manufacturing, small business, education and many others.  Everywhere of the above, various regulations, statements, contracts and other paper documents are used. <br><br>  Now it is becoming a very fashionable tendency to transfer an enterprise (institution) to an Electronic Document Management System.  It is not only fashionable, but, and, practical and convenient. <br><br>  In this regard, there are companies that provide their software products - SEDy, which, sometimes shocking their prices.  However, not everything is so bad, because  thanks to initiative and non-profit people, free and open products are born.  Examples of this may be two excellent, in my opinion, SED: NauDoc and Alfresco. <br><a name="habracut"></a>

NauDoc allows you to manage the processes of processing documents and monitor the executive discipline, receiving detailed information about the progress of tasks. <br><br>  Using NauDoc, it is possible to organize a single repository of documents with differentiated access rights based on roles, which allows employees at any time to access documents and in the shortest possible time to find all the necessary information regardless of the presence of the document holder in the workplace.  Logs allow you to register incoming, outgoing and internal documents by tracking the movement of paper copies of documents within the enterprise. <br><br>  The presence of NauDoc executive means of controlling discipline allows you to assign tasks to the employees in the system, monitor their implementation, track deadlines, send documents for approval and send agreed documents for familiarization to other users of the system.  Setting the life cycle for document categories allows you to specify typical document movement routes, configure their automatic routing and assignment of tasks. <br><br>  All actions with documents and tasks are performed through a web-interface, which allows you to connect to the system from anywhere in the world, thereby creating a single information space of the organization, including remote branches and mobile employees. <br><br>  <b>Technological features of the system</b> <br><br>  <b>*</b> 100% web-based interface allows you to connect to the system from anywhere in the world, creating a single information space for the organization, its remote branches and mobile employees. <br>  <b>* The</b> system is integrated with ABBYY FineReader Scripting Edition scanning and OCR software; <br>  <b>* the</b> system allows authentication and authorization of users in external directory services, such as LDAP or Microsoft Active Directory; <br>  <b>* The</b> system has a module for working with an electronic digital signature (EDS) and the possibility of using a digital signature of any crypto-provider that supports the Microsoft CryptoAPI interface. <br><br>  <b>Features of the NauDoc Electronic Document Management System</b> <br><br>  <b>*</b> <i>Simplification of work with organizational and administrative documents.</i> <br><br>  Electronic documents are created according to a predefined pattern.  When creating a document, the user only needs to specify the details of the details in the registration card of the document, these values ‚Äã‚Äãwill be automatically added to the text of the document.  If necessary, you can allow the user to change the template text. <br>  For each type of documents, a specific set of details can be set (requisite cards can easily be changed by the user with the rights of "Technologist"). <br>  After the document is created, the employee sends it for approval to a certain circle of persons according to the procedure adopted by the organization. <br>  The approval procedure is stored in the system: automatic monitoring of the scheduled dates is carried out, the responsible persons are notified and the progress of the document approval procedure is notified. <br>  Registration of the document in the journal occurs automatically at a certain stage of work with the document: a registration number is assigned to the document and the date of registration is recorded. <br><br>  <b>*</b> <i>Process management.</i> <br><br>  NauDoc allows you to automate the workflow associated with the production or management processes of the company.  For each process, it is possible to customize its presentation in the system, including individual stages, responsible persons and the scheduled time.  The reporting tools available in NauDoc allow you to control the stage at which each of the process instances is located, to find ‚Äúbottlenecks‚Äù and to identify those responsible for the breakdown of the deadlines.  Based on the data collected, an analysis of the process can be carried out before making changes. <br><br>  <b>*</b> <i>Simplification of the procedure for approving documents by officials.</i> <br><br>  After the document is created, the employee sends it to a certain circle of people for approval according to the document approval procedure adopted by the organization. <br>  During collective work, all actions are performed with the same copy of the document.  NauDoc users who approve the document access the document during the sighting procedure. <br>  At any stage, an agreement can be created with the name and position of the visitor and the exact time at which the document is validated. <br><br>  <b>*</b> <i>Ability to register electronic and paper documents in the system.</i> <br><br>  Registration of the document in the journal occurs automatically at a certain stage of work with the document. <br>  For paper documents, a special electronic card is created in the system, a graphic image of the document obtained by scanning can be attached to the card. <br><br>  <b>*</b> <i>Accelerating the search for documents in the details and content.</i> <br><br>  NauDoc allows you to quickly find a document by the value of a certain requisite (for example, a registration number or a brief description). <br>  The system allows you to search for the content of documents or the content of attached files. <br><br>  <b>*</b> <i>Work with incoming and outgoing correspondence.</i> <br><br>  NauDoc allows you to work with incoming and outgoing correspondence, receiving and sending e-mail through the company's mail server.  Each letter is processed in the system as a regular document. <br><br>  When processing incoming correspondence, letters are received by the secretary, who registers them in the journal of incoming correspondence.  The document is automatically assigned a registration number.  After preparation, the document is sent to the resolution of the head in accordance with the procedure adopted by the organization.  After consideration, the document is sent for familiarization or performance to employees of the organization. <br><br>  When processing outgoing correspondence, the employee creates a letter on the template adopted by the organization, sends it to the head for approval, according to the procedure adopted by the organization.  After approval of the document, it is automatically sent to the secretary.  The secretary registers a letter in the journal and sends it by e-mail.  In this case, all documents are stored in the system and are available for search. <br><br>  <b>*</b> <i>Creating a corporate web portal and website of the company.</i> <br><br>  NauDoc allows you to create Internet and intranet sites and manage content placement (CMS functionality).  Documents, graphic images and other NauDoc objects can be content. <br>  Convenient development and editing of site pages in the integrated WISYWIG editor, version control. <br>  Manage the publication of news, questionnaires and polls. <br>  Built-in design and change the design of the site pages. <br>  Centralized access control in sections of the site, the ability to coordinate the documents before publication on the site. <br>  NauDoc exists in 2 editions: NauDoc <b>Free</b> and NauDoc <b>Enterprise</b> (you can get acquainted with the ‚Äúbuns‚Äù that the commercial version provides on the official website; you will find all links at the end of the post) <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/116/de9/19c/116de919c55811926ac289382c5fd630.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  The Alfresco system is one of the most common in the West electronic document management and project management systems.  This is largely due to the openness of the code (full open source) and the difference from the majority of products with open source work stability and scalability to the tasks of a business of any size.  This is not surprising since John Newton, one of the leaders and co-owners of Documentum, the global market leader in electronic document management systems for enterprises, is still the ‚Äúfather‚Äù and main designer of the Alfresco system.  Such companies as Activision, American Stock Exchange, Cisco, Electronic Arts, etc. successfully work with the system.  The system can work on virtually any platform and with any databases.  A number of Alfresco systems can easily cope with the load of millions of stored documents and tens of thousands of users. <br><br>  The low popularity of the system in Russia is a consequence of the fact that until recently there were no companies capable of providing professional services for the implementation of support and training for users of the Alfresco system. <br><br>  <b>Alfresco Benefits</b> <br><br>  Alfresco is a web-based EDMS.  This is convenient because: <br>  * no need to put on the machine users additional PO; <br>  * There are no problems with updating the client software. <br>  * it is possible to work from anywhere in the world, including from mobile devices; <br>  * Alfresco has the most advanced web-based interface: convenient, fast and beautiful. <br><br>  But the European and American SED, including Alfresco, 3 years ago, stopped making a major bet on the web interface.  Of course, his support is there, but it is used for remote access to documents and nothing more. <br><br>  Because when a person is in an office or a branch connected to a VPN network, there is nothing more convenient and easier than working with folders and files in the usual way.  Edit documents in office applications.  People are accustomed to work that way, they know how to work and they will work that way.  And the use of any other interfaces, even the web, causes understandable irritation, a reduction in the speed of work and, as a result, sabotage of the implementation. <br><br>  But how to work with standard folders and files, because they do not support versioning, access control by roles, routing, etc.? <br><br>  The solution has long been found and used in European and American SED!  Imagine that there are 2 folders on your desktop (Or a different number of folders, this is just an example): <br>  "Documents for consideration" <br>  "Corporate Documents" <br><br>  Open the first one.  There are 3 documents.  You know that if they got there, you must decide on them.  Open them in the usual MS Word double click.  And, about a miracle, you can not only read the text of the document, but open any versions, read comments, make decisions and send the document for consideration to arbitrary persons without going anywhere from MS Word (MS Excel, MS Power Point).  Moreover, in the same place you see your tasks entering and outgoing. <br><br>  Need to create and launch a new contract for approval?  There is nothing easier.  Create a document in MS Word and send straight from there on a standard route.  Or, first create a file and simply copy it to the Corporate Documents / Draft Contracts folder.  The document will immediately be entered into the EDS and go along the standard route. <br><br>  Nobody refuses the web interface either.  In the Alfresco web interface, you can perform all the functions listed and much more.  The Web is convenient for business trips, for quick access from a phone or laptop, for performing complex group operations with documents and tasks, generating reports. <br><br>  <b>There are 2 main versions</b> of the Alfresco system: Community Edition and Enterprise Edition. <br><br>  <i>Community Edition is</i> completely free, can be downloaded and installed in any company.  However, the system has no support other than the voluntary assistance of members of the Alfresco user community.  But despite this, the editors of the Community remain one of the most common variants of electronic document management systems in Europe.  The system supports the possibility of placing on a cloud server or cluster, thereby being a worthy solution for both 10 and 10,000 users.  Embedded databases: MySQL and PostgreSQL. <br><br>  <i>Enterprise Edition</i> is an industrial edition of a system that runs under the control of powerful Oracle or MS SQL databases.  Such systems are certified by Alfresco and system users are provided with a guarantee for the <s>stable operation of the system,</s> support and updates. <br><br>  <b>Key features of the Alfresco system</b> <br><br>  <b>*</b> full web-interface; <br>  <b>*</b> full-text document search; <br>  <b>*</b> integration with LDAP, Sharepoint, MS Office, Email, Firefox &amp; IE, Google Gadget; <br>  <b>*</b> versioning of documents; <br>  <b>*</b> version comparison; <br>  <b>*</b> flexible role-based access to documents; <br>  <b>*</b> support for graphical business process editor JBoss jBMP; <br>  <b>*</b> support for simple workflow Created using the "creation wizard"; <br>  <b>*</b> Integrated microsite-based project management system. <br><br>  <b>Conclusion</b> <br>  The final decision is on which system each decides on himself, however, I will finally give a recommendation regarding <b>NauDoc</b> : first, the system is quite convenient and has a fairly simple interface.  Secondly, it is quickly put up without any ‚Äúdances with a tambourine‚Äù (with Alfresco you will have to do a bit of work and ‚Äúpaint‚Äù the manuals).  Thirdly, it has official support for the Russian language (which is important enough!), Because it is being developed in Russia, which cannot be said about Alfresco (there is a Russian language, but support is provided by enthusiasts). <br><br>  <b>PS:</b> There are many other open and free electronic document management systems, but for consideration I chose two, in my opinion, leaders in this area. <br>  <b>PPS:</b> I did not know in which section to move the topic, because  I did not find a section called ‚ÄúSEDs‚Äù or ‚ÄúECM‚Äù (there is reason to think about this for the Habr administration), so he was here. <br><br>  <b>Sources</b> <br><br>  <a href="http://www.doc-online.ru/">www.doc-online.ru</a> <br>  <a href="http://www.naudoc.ru/">www.naudoc.ru</a> <br>  <a href="http://www.alfresco.com/">www.alfresco.com</a> <br>  <a href="http://wiki.alfresco.com/">wiki.alfresco.com</a> <br>  <a href="http://myalfresco.blogspot.com/">myalfresco.blogspot.com</a> <br>  <a href="http://www.sql.ru/Forum/">www.sql.ru/Forum</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/143740/">https://habr.com/ru/post/143740/</a></p>
