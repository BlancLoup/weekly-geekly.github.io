These 11 books will help you start a career and start again.  You are not stalled! <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/685/caa/bad/685caabadd1e4f6bbe701f88c80db005.jpg"><a name="habracut"></a><br><br><h4>  <b>1. “Stop dreaming, do business!”, Cal Newport</b> </h4><br><h6>  Starting your own business, you are likely to encounter a very common point of view, which is that your favorite business a priori will bring you income. <br>  However, according to Newport, this is far from the ultimate truth.  According to him, many people, mastering a particular skill, can thus find something that will become the passion of their whole life, as any new skill allows them to succeed and build a career. <br>  He does not offer you to give up the dream, but before you realize it, make sure that you really calculated the chances for your possible success in the market. </h6>

      <a href="http://icanchoose.ru/blog/41-resurs-dlya-poiska-i-osvoeniya-poleznyh-navykov/">41 resources for finding and learning new skills.</a>  Chose themselves! <br><br><h4>  <b>2. “Black Swan”, Nassim Taleb</b> </h4><br><h6>  People love to create some kind of illusion of certainty of their own lives, so many of us believe and follow predictions. <br>  In the book “Black Swan”, the philosopher and investor Nassim Taleb writes about how wrong it is to build his life based on such predictions, and cites as an example the cases of the complete collapse of powerful corporations - for example, the financial system crisis in 2007. <br>  This book is among the few that can actually change our view of the world as a whole.  Take time to read it. </h6><br><br><h4>  <b>3. “Do not be afraid to act,” Cheryl Sandberg</b> </h4><br><h6>  Regardless of whether you agree with the highly controversial Sandberg theories, her book “Do not be afraid to act” is simply a must-read if you are interested in the topic of women's entrepreneurship. <br>  In the book, the author cites the specific results of interesting research, as well as the stories of specific women, in order to find out exactly which actions could negatively affect professional success.  In addition, she leads an action algorithm, a guide for those who wish to help women succeed in business. <br>  This book will make the reader of any gender think about what is actually a success factor and allows you to get satisfaction from your work. </h6><br><br><h4>  <b>4. “The Power of Habit”, Charles Dahigg</b> </h4><br><h6>  It may seem that the book describing the scientific theories of life habits change can make you feel sad, but in this case it is not at all so. <br>  In fact, this is one of the most useful books for young professionals who seek a happy and fulfilling life. <br>  Charles Dahigg, investigative reporter for The New York Times, explains that the road to success is shaped through tiny changes (whether it is quitting smoking or procrastination), which means you can translate them into your life today. </h6><br><br><h4>  <b>5. “Think and Grow Rich”, Napoleon Hill</b> </h4><br><h6>  Each of us, who start a business from scratch, very soon comes to the conclusion that the ability to establish interpersonal relationships is as important as all the skills that we list in our resumes. <br>  “Think and Grow Rich” has become the best-selling book since 1937 and the first book on how to achieve major business success. <br>  Napoleon Hill was a journalist who befriended Andrew Carnegie, the richest man in the world at that time.  Carnegie spent a lot of time sharing career growth lessons with Hill to help them achieve prosperity and wealth, after which Hill set himself the task of telling people about these ideas. <br>  “Think and Grow Rich” is a truly invaluable collection of recommendations for creating profitable relationships with people and achieving business success that you can start practicing without prior preparation. </h6><br><br><h4>  <b>6. “How to win friends and influence people”, Dale Carnegie</b> </h4><br><h6>  Along with “Think and Grow Rich,” the book “How to Win Friends and Influence People” since the Great Depression rightfully remains a real bestseller. <br>  The favorite book of the legendary investor Warren Buffett, the creation of Carnegie, contains mainly psychological recommendations to strengthen and improve relationships with people, and with proper use, they will help to achieve success in business and credibility in society. <br>  The author’s language and its reference to specific sources are very outdated; nevertheless, his main recommendations on how to overcome conflicts and how to inspire others are still relevant today, just as several decades ago. </h6><br><br><h4>  <b>7. “Strengths Finder 2.0”, Tom Rath</b> </h4><br><h6>  The philosophy of the book “StrengthsFinder 2.0” is that we have to spend less time assessing our own weaknesses and weaknesses, and more about what we do well. <br>  Based on the 2001 book published by Gallup, the second edition includes recommendations for analyzing one’s own strengths, as well as options for using them in practice. <br>  If you have already come to the conclusion in which sphere you will be able to best realize your personal qualities, then this book will help you determine the choice of a professional niche and find out in which area you will be of great benefit to society. </h6><br><br><h4>  <b>8. “From zero to one”, Peter Thiel</b> </h4><br><h6>  For about 20 years we have been living in a world where young entrepreneurs become billionaires thanks to startups and become the first on Wall Street - those whom Tom Wolfe called “The Lords of the World”. <br>  Thil, a billionaire investor and entrepreneur, lifts the curtain over this world, which was previously inaccessible to mere mortals.  “From zero to one” is a brief and interesting guide on how easy and efficiently you can build a successful business. </h6><br><br><h4>  <b>9. “How to put things in order”, David Allen</b> </h4><br><h6>  Thirteen years after the first publication, Allen prepared for publication the second edition of the acclaimed bestseller “How to put things in order”. <br>  This book is simply a must-read for those who consider themselves a novice in a particular area - it teaches readers the basics of time management in everyday life.  The idea is to create your personal system of organizing the flow of daily affairs and freeing up the mental space to focus on long-term goals. <br>  A concrete example: the “two minutes rule” for monitoring a constantly overflowing inbox. </h6><br><br><h4>  <b>10. “Never Eat Alone,” Kate Ferrazzi</b> </h4><br>
<h6>  According to Ferrazzi himself, for the most part of his professional success, he is bound to connections with specific people, relationships that he diligently created and which he continues to maintain. <br>  Long before he entered the Yale and Harvard School of Entrepreneurship, before he made the “40 under 40” list, Ferrazzi lived in a small town, being the son of a cleaner and a steelworker. <br>  In his book, Ferrazzi outlines a simple and understandable strategy that he used as a young professional when dealing with people whom he admired.  You can also use this algorithm to successfully create a personal network of contacts with “useful” people. </h6><br><br><h4>  <b>11. “Take or Give,” Adam Grant</b> </h4><br><h6>  In our culture, for some reason, it is considered that we should behave like true barbarians, and only then can we succeed in the professional sphere. <br>  But in his best-selling book, “Take or Give,” Adam Grant, a Wharton psychologist, explains in detail why this view is wrong.  Studies show that people who can appreciate others are doing better in all areas of life, and Grant demonstrates by examples how to become one of them. <br></h6></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/297554/">https://habr.com/ru/post/297554/</a></p>
