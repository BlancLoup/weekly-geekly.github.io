  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Experience successful crowdfunding. Top 5 best projects Indiegogo</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Compared to the promoted Kickstarter, the oldest crowdfunding platform Indiegogo has a number of advantages.  Firstly, Indiegogo has a wider geography - projects on it can be created not only by Americans and British, like on Kickstarter, but by everyone, including the Russians.  Secondly, there are no restrictions on the type of projects - the range is very wide, from technology to educational and entertainment.  Another important detail is that the funding model allows a startup to keep the amount collected, even if the aforementioned goal is not achieved.  The project continues to evolve, and backers receive their products at a reduced price. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/307/83c/000/30783c00081743b6838682d4b202b63d.jpg"><br><br>  Of course, all these advantages attract to Indiegogo a huge number of investment-seeking projects and a multi-million user audience that is ready to financially support these projects.  Watching the activities of colleagues with professional interest, the VCStart team studied the most successful projects of Indiegogo, and made up the TOP-5 startups, who are currently raising funds at the site for the implementation of their projects.  Here they are: <a name="habracut"></a>

    <h4>  1. Ritot projection clock </h4><br>  The era of wearable gadgets has already arrived, and who did not have time, he most likely was late.  While Apple is tilting with its iWatch, having exceeded all possible expectations limits, creative and enterprising people don‚Äôt lose their time.  And this is not about vendors, like Samsung, which obviously hurried with the release of its ‚Äúsmart watches‚Äù in an attempt to get ahead of the main competitor. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/d95/36f/704/d9536f70400240158d5f8c1e803ed31d.png"><br><br>  Ritot offers something better and more functional to users who supported it on Indiegogo.  The first projecting Ritot watches have an elegant design and modern functionality, while dispensing with the omnipresent touchscreen, which their developers, apparently, have already written off in the scrap history.  Instead, the watch, synchronized with a smartphone, in the form of a rather thin bracelet, projects all the information that usually goes on the screen directly into your hand. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/fd3/dd3/7ed/fd3dd37edfc74773b8994b5a7d011fe1.png"><br><br>  And these are incoming call notifications, text messages, reminders, letters, calendar alerts, messages from Facebook and Twitter, and notifications from other applications.  If you do not hear the call, the watch quietly bears on your wrist.  In general, the thing is useful, inexpensive and stylish.  For backers, the pleasure costs only $ 120, which is half the future retail price.  Until the end of the round of financing, another 11 days, and the watch has already ‚Äúraised‚Äù $ 1,259,133, which is 2518% of the stated target amount ($ 50,000). <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/e8b/6b8/ca4/e8b6b8ca442d4593ba5b7e7c60b3d199.jpg"><br><br><h4>  2. Jibo - the world's first family robot </h4><br>  Professor of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology Cynthia Briezel is known in the world as a pioneer of social robotics.  And her obsession with the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãmaking a robot a pet and a true friend of a person embodied in Jibo - a home robot assistant, whose design very much resembles Eve - the beloved of the main character in the cartoon "Wall-e." <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/3N1Q8oFpX1Y%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700021,15700186,15700190,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhi_96IWAtIQRmof4pSWcDwPwq43YQ" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  Although, ‚Äúassistant‚Äù, it is loudly said, scratching with your tongue - you don‚Äôt need a lot of mind.  Namely this is what Djibo basically is.  The robot is ready for a modest reward to its creators (from $ 600) to become your interlocutor, he can also plan your day and remind you of important meetings and tasks.  And also shoot your family holidays with the built-in camera, establish video calls and play with children. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/1b4/80a/8df/1b480a8df2d34b26b9cd1c58a79f7bd5.gif"><br><br>  Cons: cook, wash, clean the apartment, guard the house Djibo can not.  Due to this, the product is still damp, but, nevertheless, it collected $ 1,887,752 for two months, exceeding the target amount by 1888%.  The fundraising campaign ends in 10 days. <br><br><h4>  3.Skully AR-1: when a helmet is smarter than a motorcyclist </h4><br>  This is a miracle of modern technology, wearing which you probably feel like Robocop, already on the first day of the round of financing collected $ 800 thousand. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/b14/b4e/5b6/b14b4e5b6ae34a7b9513e0b8f8a15e48.gif"><br><br>  The helmet is made of lightweight polycarbonate according to all the rules of aerodynamics, has an internal display, wide-angle rear view camera, anti-fog and anti-glare visor with enhanced protection, reducing the sweating of Outlast by 70%, GPS-navigator, built-in speakers and a player.  Connects to a smartphone via Bluetooth.  The project raised $ 1710189, exceeding the goal by more than 8 times, the campaign will last until September 9.  The cost of a helmet without delivery is $ 1399, delivery is promised in May 2015. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/ZdcWd594lRw%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700021,15700186,15700190,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhgMO8gciXIOI8Op7Ws11S0Lhror6g" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br><h4>  4.TouchPico: pico-projector with touch image </h4><br>  The gadget is a box sized portable hard drive, but the size of the image displayed on the surface reaches 80 inches.  TouchPico differs from existing pico-projectors with which no one will be surprised for a long time, with one important feature - the image displayed on any surface is interactive. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/cab/ec0/1a8/cabec01a8bb1413c9763f63756bcb54b.png"><br><br>  The projector is equipped with a stylus, the movements of which are tracked by an infrared camera integrated into the TouchPico, which provides interaction.  In addition, there is an audio jack, an HDMI port and a Wi-Fi module that allows you to project any image from mobile devices and PCs onto any surface.  The project has already collected $ 663.186 (1.206%), and by the end of the campaign another 3 weeks, which suggests that the amount will increase at least twice.  Retail gadget will cost $ 500, and pre-order will cost 379. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/730/fa1/659/730fa16596d8431ebd81b52d53393c53.jpg"><br><br><h4>  5. ZEN Thermostat </h4><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/191/0af/b96/1910afb9634542b48b87f8b535f87e72.gif"><br><br>  "Smart thermostat" - a device with a very minimalist design, but functional and beautiful.  Zen thermostat goes without a display - information is displayed on it through the built-in LEDs, which looks quite original.  Features - control of heating and ventilation, scheduling changes in temperature in the room.  Financing ends after 25 days, but the thermostat has already collected the stated amount.  For the backer device will cost $ 150, in retail - about 200. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/aec/b7f/393/aecb7f393ab742578d8acc48c035ea96.png"><br><br>  Determination of positions in the TOP was carried out taking into account financial indicators, the most striking innovations and user likes.  And according to the leaders of Indiegogo, we can draw the following conclusion: a modern Western user is most willing to financially support a physically tangible product that has a utilitarian purpose (this was recently confirmed by the <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/vcstart/blog/234771/">Coolest Cooler project who</a> set a new record for Kickstarter fees) than to donate to charity or invest in BY. <br><br>  The majority of Russian startups that attract funding on our collective investment platform are engaged in the development of web projects and mobile solutions.  Let's not rush to conclusions - good or bad - time will tell.  But the fact that Russian startups should turn their attention to the successful experience of foreign colleagues is a fact.  Experience - a useful thing, it can be useful. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/235783/">https://habr.com/ru/post/235783/</a></p>
