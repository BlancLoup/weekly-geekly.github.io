Recently stumbled upon, rereading a beloved classic.  In my opinion, this is a wonderful example of how to solve tasks. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  “So it’s still with the late sovereign,” Pyotr Ippolitovich addressed me nervously and with some agony, as if suffering for the success of the effect, “you know this stone,” a stupid stone in the street, why? just interferes, right?  The king went many times, and each time this stone.  Finally, the sovereign did not like it, and indeed: the whole mountain, there is a mountain on the street, spoils the street: “So that there is no stone!” Well, he said that it was not, - do you understand what it means “that it was not”?  Dead person remember?  What to do with the stone?  All lost their heads;  here the Duma, and most importantly, here, I don’t remember who exactly, but one of the very first grandees to whom it was entrusted.  This grandee listens: they say, fifteen thousand will cost, no less, and silver-s (because the banknotes with the late sovereign only turned to silver).  “Like fifteen thousand, what a game!” At first, the British wanted to let the rails down, put them on the rails and take the ferry;  but what would it cost?  There were no railways then, only Tsarskoye Selo's walked ... <br><br>  “Well, it was possible to cut it,” I began to frown;  I was terribly sad and ashamed in front of Versilov;  but he listened with visible pleasure.  I understood that he was also glad to the owner, because he too was ashamed of me, I saw it;  I remember, it was even as if touching from him.

      “It was precisely to cut, sir, it was precisely this idea that was attacked, and it was Montferan;  He then built St. Isaac's Cathedral.  Saw, says, and then bring.  Yes, sir, what will it cost? <br><br>  - Nothing worth it, just cut it and take it out. <br><br>  - No, let me, because here you need to put the car, steam, with, and, moreover, where to bring?  And besides, such a mountain?  Ten thousand, they say, will not do less, ten or twelve thousand. <br><br>  “Listen, Pyotr Ippolitovich, because this is nonsense, it was not so ...” But at this time Versilov winked at me imperceptibly, and in that wink I saw such delicate compassion for the host, even suffering for him, that I liked it terribly, and I laughed. <br><br>  “Well, here, here,” said the owner, who had noticed nothing and was terribly afraid, as always these storytellers, that they would start knocking him with questions, “just one burgher fits, and still young, you know, a Russian man, a beard a wedge, in a dolphin caftan, and almost a little drunken little ... well, no, not intoxicating, sir.  Only this petty bourgeois is standing, as they are conspiring, the British and Montferan, and this person, who is entrusted with something, immediately arrived in the wheelchair, listens and is angry: how it is decided and cannot be solved;  and suddenly notices in the distance, this philistine is standing and smiling falsely, that is, not false, I am not, but how could it be ... <br><br>  “Mockingly,” Versilov carefully assented. <br><br>  - You are mockingly, that is, a little mockingly, such a kind Russian smile is, you know;  Well, a person, of course, under an annoying hand, you know: “You're here, beard, what are you waiting for?  Who is this? ”-“ Why, he says, I see a pebble, Your Highness. ”  It seems that lordship;  yes, it was not Prince Suvorov, Italian, the descendant of the commander ... But, no, not Suvorov, and what a pity that you forgot who exactly, you know, even though Highness, but a pure Russian, a Russian type , patriot, developed Russian heart;  Well, I guessed: “Well, you, perhaps, say, you will bring a stone: why are you grinning?” - “There are more agrants in your country, your lordship, they take too much of a disproportionate price, because the Russian purse is thick, and they have nothing at home .  Determine one hundred rubles, your lordship, and tomorrow evening we will reduce a pebble. ”  Well, you can submit a similar proposal.  The British, of course, want to eat;  Monferan laughs;  only this radiant, Russian heart: “To give, he says, he has a hundred rubles!  Surely, he says, will you bring them? ”-“ Tomorrow, in the evening, please, your Highness. ”  - “How are you going to do it?” - “This is, if it is not insulting to your lordship, our secret,” says, and, you know, a sort of Russian language.  I liked: "Uh, give him everything that will require!" Well, and left;  what would you think he did? <br><br>  The owner stopped and began to circle us with a tender look. <br><br>  “I don't know,” Versilov smiled;  I was very frowned. <br><br>  “But how he did it, sir,” said the host with such a triumph, as if he himself had done it, “he hired peasants with spies, simple sorts of Russians, and began digging near the very stone, just at the edge, of the pit;  they dug up a whole night, dug up a huge one, evenly growing stone, and so only at the top even deeper, but as they dug, he ordered, little by little and carefully, to dig in the ground from under the stone itself.  Well, naturally, like being undermined, there is nothing for the stone to stand on, the balance has swayed;  but as the balance reeled, they pebble something from the other side already with their hands they pooled, like a bang, in Russian: a stone and a boo in the pit!  Immediately they shoveled them with shovels, rammed them with a tamper, they piled them with pebbles — smoothly, the pebble disappeared! <br><br>  <b>ps</b> .  I would say that this is a wonderful example not so much of how to solve problems, but of the fact that everything can often be done easier, faster and cheaper - if you look at things easier, throwing aside judgments - seeing everything as it really is .  This is just some kind of Zen) <br><br>  And yes, read the “Teenager” of Dostoevsky without a doubt, if you have not read it - it is an interesting reading;  the story of a classic stone will be debunked - but I did not say that) </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/66088/">https://habr.com/ru/post/66088/</a></p>
