(the games will start on August 8, 2008) To be honest, these games are probably threatening to become the most unsophisticated in terms of media, and if we talk about the mobile Internet, then at the moment I have found only a few websites that will help to keep abreast of all Olympic affairs wherever you are.  Perhaps we start with the official website of the Olympiad - <a href="http://beijing2008.cn/">Beijing2008.cn</a> , which has a version for mobile phones and PDAs (of course in English - <a href="http://wap.beijing2008.cn/pams/s.do%3Fp%3D507%26lo%3Den">wap.beijing2008.cn/pams/s.do?p=507&amp;lo=en.</a> The site is made in the style of "all in one ", News, wallpapers for free download, national anthem, and so on. Moreover, if we compare it with the WAP version of the official website of the Sochi 2014 Olympics - <a href="http://wap.sochi2014.com/">wap.sochi2014.com,</a> the sites are very similar in structure, which means that the requirement for them is set" from above "and one for all resources. On the site you can find relevant information on the Olympic Games, as well  You can find maps of cities in which competitions will take place, information for visitors, as well as a navigator around Olympic sites, but unfortunately, this feature will be available only to owners of Windows Mobile-based gadgets. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/olpictures/344/b97/4f4/344b974f4024aaf0705f490a18c90ec8.gif" width="184" height="315" hspace="10" vspace="10" align="right"><br>  NBC, which has exclusive broadcasting rights (radio, TV) for the Beijing Olympic Games and of course, NBC has launched the WEB and WAP (Mobile) version of the site where you can watch video broadcasts or excerpts of competitions - <a href="http://mobile.nbcolympics.com/">mobile.nbcolympics.com</a> Also on the site you can find information about competitions, interesting facts about the games, as well as a biography of the majority of participants in the Olympic Games, but unfortunately, this information will be relevant only for US residents, or for those interested in sports in the US.  The site itself and all content is adapted to most mobile terminals and you should have no problems viewing this resource and receiving informational content. <br><br>  Mainstream news, perhaps on one of the best news resources - The New York Times, which also prepared a mobile version of its resource, on which you can find a lot of information on the subject of the Olympiad - <a href="http://mobile.nytimes.com/section%3Fs%3D84">mobile.nytimes.com/section?s=84</a>

      MSN is also not lagging behind with its mobile version of the page devoted to the Olympiad falls into this list - <a href="http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/24110220/">msnbc.msn.com/id/24110220</a> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/olpictures/6d8/0bb/383/6d80bb383957b5350a0d2084e93d33e1.png" width="184" height="321" hspace="10" vspace="10" align="left"><br>  The site of the Olympic Games from Yahoo contains a large clock that shows the countdown to the start of the Olympic Games.  The Yahoo mobile site differs from most sites of a similar subject in that the main focus of the Yahoo site is still news, a lot of news, and of course competition results.  On the website in real time, you can track the results of the qualifying competitions for US teams (unfortunately only the USA), and in the future to monitor all the results of the Olympic Games, while the update period is set to 1 minute.  Thus, every minute on the site there are relevant news and information on the results. <br>  By the way, the Yahoo mobile portal is created on CSM by <a href="http://www.netbiscuits.com/home">NetBiscuits</a> , a German company that is known for its CMS mobile sites.  The color scheme of the Olympic portal Yahoo is very similar to the new mobile version of pratra, which is currently under testing. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/olpictures/2fa/5b8/2d7/2fa5b82d7ddde1c92f08f4a3dcace2a1.png" width="184" height="256" hspace="10" vspace="10" align="right"><br>  Leaving aside the many small sites and pages devoted to the Olympics, I could not overlook the BBC mobile portal. <br><br>  So what about the portal?  The portal has multiplied articles and news devoted not only to the Olympics, but also to sport in general - <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/mobile/bbc_sport/olympicsport/">http://news.bbc.co.uk/mobile/bbc_sport/olympicsport/</a> in addition, on the portal you will find numerous sections devoted to various Olympic sports.  A huge plus of this site is that not only US news, but also world sports news are reviewed and reviewed.  While reading news and articles, you can chat with sports fans in a special forum created for mobile Internet users.  (By the way, the forum is still discussing football (soccer) and the performance of the Russian team at Euro 2008) <br><br>  Unfortunately, all the resources found and cited in this article are English-speaking; in the process of preparing the material, no more than one worthy resource was found that could bear the name ‚Äúmobile portal‚Äù.  I hope that in the near future there will be a resource that will not only be of a content-entertainment nature, but also carry informational load on visitors.  It remains only to wait. <br><br>  Oriental ProWAP Blog </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/29243/">https://habr.com/ru/post/29243/</a></p>
