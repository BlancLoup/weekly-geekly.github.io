  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Now comments ala Habrahabr in any blog!</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Recently, 2 new <strong>web 2.0</strong> projects have emerged from closed beta testing: <a href="http://www.intensedebate.com/">Intense Debate</a> and <a href="http://disqus.com/">Disqus</a> .  Both of them have similar functionality and offer a radically new way to look at the commenting system on blogs. <br>  With a few mouse clicks, a blogger can set up a commenting system with huge features and web-based content on his blog. <br>  Let's take a closer look at the Intense Debate service (initially this article was planned as a comparative for both services, but for some unknown reason Disqus refused to work normally on my blog, even launching it on a specially developed test blog with a standard template did not help. I don‚Äôt exclude the reason that it‚Äôs banal Disqus is not inferior to its competitor in functionality, and even has a number of unique functions. Therefore, I suggest everyone to pay attention to it). <br>  After installing the widget on my blog (supported by <strong>Blogger, Wordpress, TypePad</strong> ), I received comments with the following features: <br>  1. Beautiful design that automatically adjusts to the fonts and colors of the blog. <br>  2. Treelike structure of comments (ala <strong>Habrahabr</strong> ) - now readers can lead verbal battles between themselves on the blog. <br>  3. Pro / Con evaluation system. <br>  4. Reputation System (for registered users) <br>  5. Comments of the author of the blog are highlighted in a separate color. <br>  6. The ability to subscribe to the RSS feed as to all comments in the post, and to any like internal discussion. <br>  7. Avatars (for registered users). <br>  8. The "menu" button next to the avatar, on which anyone can get on any of your website, blog, subscribe to the RSS-feed with comments, or even subscribe to the feed of another of your blog without even visiting it. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/olpictures/b01/643/afa/b01643afab62cd5c528fa3961b9ecf66.jpg" width="450" height="516" hspace="10" vspace="10" align="right"><br><br>  Directly on the site Intense Debate blogger gets at its disposal a system of accounting and management of comments on his blog: <br>  1.Statistics (the number of comments, their percentage, the average number of characters in the comments, the average reputation of your commentators, the last 5 comments of your blog, the most commented blog posts ...) <br>  2. Moderation of comments (both individually and in all). <br>  3. History of comments. <br>  4. Antispam protection (all for moderation; all new commentators for moderation; number of links in comments, upon reaching which the comment goes for moderation; keywords for which the comment goes for moderation; black list of words for which the comment is automatically deleted ; full ban of a specific commentator).  I checked the protection system for recognition of the Cyrillic alphabet - everything works! <br>  5. Import / export comments. <br>  6. Skins comments form (currently available only 2 topics).  Opportunity for advanced users to play with CSS styles themselves (though developers are strongly advised not to do this until the system is out of beta) <br>  7. Widgets for your blog. <br><br>  But this is only the tip of the iceberg.  The main purpose of Intense Debate and Disqus is to create a worldwide social network of bloggers and their commentators.  A reader who decides to register in the system receives a single account for all blogs that host the Intense Debate or Disqus systems ‚Äî a single avatar, a single reputation system that takes into account all comments and their ratings on all blogs where the reader left a comment.  At the same time, you can communicate both directly in blogs and on the service sites themselves: the ‚Äúfriends‚Äù system is provided in the Intense Debate, and Disqus generally offers a unique function - the forum of your readers.

      In short, a new type of interaction of the Internet public has been proposed to the public on the basis of a commenting system.  And its success primarily depends on bloggers who will decide whether or not to switch to these unique services.  The advantages are obvious - it is really interesting to comment.  And most importantly: the blogger receives not just commentators, but a real social community. <br>  In my opinion, this is the second most important and truly <strong>useful</strong> for the Internet community web 2.0 concept after the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãsocial bookmarking. <br>  Source: <a href="http://bloggertoolz.blogspot.com/">http://bloggertoolz.blogspot.com/</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/15748/">https://habr.com/ru/post/15748/</a></p>
