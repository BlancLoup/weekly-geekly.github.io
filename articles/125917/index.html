      They can, and characterize a person with the positive side, and talk about such qualities as dedication, performance, perseverance.  But in e-commerce, this habit can be a disservice.  Than to waste precious time studying design or photoshop, it is better to find a performer at a reasonable price, and to devote your strength to the organization and development of business. <br><br>  Error number 2 <br>  <b>Lack of work on repeat purchases</b> <br><br>  An entrepreneur invests a lot of effort and money in attracting new customers, but does not work at all with full-time customers.  Although it is they who can become a real ‚Äúgold mine‚Äù for the seller. <br><br>  Error number 3 <br>  <b>Adoption of the advice of incompetent interlocutors</b> <br><br>  On any forum on commercial topics, you can find a lot of "experts" who do not know a damn thing in business!  They have no success in online commerce and real experience behind them, but there are a thousand tips for all occasions to any member of the forum. <br><br>  Error number 4 <br>  <b>Chase traffic</b> <br><br>  Many businessmen initially dream of fabulous numbers of attendance.  That's just what concerns the Internet, attendance and shopping - this is not the same thing.  When promoting their resource, many entrepreneurs set targets for optimizers on attendance and place in the TOP.  But why do we need such attendance, if 1% of visitors do not become buyers?  It is necessary to be pursued not for quantity, but for quality, with an emphasis on target visitors. <br><br>  Error number 5 <br>  <b>Lack of USP</b> <br><br>  A unique trading position (this is exactly how M. Rasmussen decodes UTP, although the term ‚Äúunique selling proposition‚Äù is more familiar to us) is what distinguishes your product and your store from its competitors.  However, UTP few people attach importance.  That is why there are a lot of identical shops with the same goods on the Internet.  The question is how to choose the buyer? <br><br>  Error number 6 <br>  <b>Neglect learning</b> <br><br>  A novice entrepreneur and so all the time goes on business.  Training at the same time seems to be somewhat burdensome and unnecessary.  It seems that everything can be learned "in the process."  Nothing like this!  "In the process," you can fill a bunch of cones, and stepping on the same rake, but did not understand what is wrong.  Progress does not stand still, it is important to constantly remember this and strive after it. <br><br>  Error number 7 <br>  <b>The desire to make the "perfect" site</b> <br><br>  What is the perfect site for a budding entrepreneur?  These are awesome graphical effects, flash-videos, heaped scripts, etc.  Only now practice shows that such sites do not sell. <br>  The site should be convenient, intuitive, meaningful (tasty photos of goods and selling texts) - only in this case success is guaranteed. <br><br>  Error number 8 <br>  <b>Lack of focus in work</b> <br><br>  Often, instead of working through one strategy to the end or introducing one successful methodology in all of its projects, an entrepreneur grabs the next ‚Äúamazing opportunity.‚Äù  Here comes into force a law called "For two hares." <br><br>  Error number 9 <br>  <b>Copying other business resources</b> <br><br>  Here, even without comment.  And so it is clear that this method will not bring success and respect among colleagues. <br><br>  Error number 10 <br>  <b>Waiting for instant results</b> <br><br>  ... and as a consequence, a fall in spirit.  It is important to remember that success does not come in two days.  Any achievement is the result of constant labor. <br><br>  These are the mistakes of M.Rasmussen. <br><br>  Maybe someone will add? </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/125917/">https://habr.com/ru/post/125917/</a></p>
