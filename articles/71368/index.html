Earned !!! <br>  Now I have the opportunity to help at least some people who are puzzled by the transition from Windows Mobile (hereinafter WM) to Android. <br><br>  Immediately I warn you that the article is not designed for geeks, does not carry <b>anything</b> brilliant. <br>  This article is a summary of my experience using the WM device, and it may be useful to readers, but not to habra writers. <br><br>  Throw me eggs (kamentami), but for 95% of users, you need only 5 minutes to go to Android.  But for the preparation ... In any case, in my opinion it is simple. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  So to make it clear why this is simple, I will briefly explain how everything is organized with me: <br>  For 5 years of WM operation, I had all the possible WM options, I killed (yes, the defenders of Green Peace will forgive me) about 10 animals, and countless firmware on each of them was tried.  Who uses WM, he knows that it is very unreliable (and it is not for this reason that one wants to jump on Android faster, but doesn‚Äôt allow conscience on an I-phone, they say, very pops? .. 
      <br>
        <script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>
        <ins class="adsbygoogle"
          style="display:block; text-align:center;"
          data-ad-layout="in-article"

      <br>
      It was necessary to frequently reflash, hardrezitit devices, therefore, clear criteria were developed for the organization of the information space of the WM communicator: <br>  1. Everything should be as default as possible. <br>  2. Everything should be synchronized and stored centrally. <br>  3. There should be no synchronization over the wire ... It does not suit me and the point. <br>  4. Everything should be as simple as possible.  The smaller the types of information, the easier it is to manage them.  The less software, the less glitches, etc. <br><br>  By the way, these criteria and eventually led to come to the widespread use of Googleservice. <br><br>  As a result, over 5 years of operation on WM 6.1 on the Glofiish M700 came to the following (I tried almost all the software that is available for WM Mobile): <br>  After another flashing, hard rezet, killing, losing my device, I do: <br>  1. Install SPB MobileShell fresh version. <br>  2. Setting up synchronization with MS Exchange (Google MS Exchange) <br>  3. Installing Opera Mobile <br>  4. Installing Google Maps <br>  5. A five-minute magic with the adjustment of buttons and other trifles. <br>  Total: 15 minutes and the device is fully ready for the <s>next murder of the</s> next active exploitation (although for this, I picked up the correct firmware for a couple of evenings). <br><br>  And IMHO to go to Android, you need to be a convinced and conscious fan of Google Service. <br>  In addition, the transition to Android is a good reason to clean up the data and optimize the management of personal information. <br>  This is preparation.  If you have not done this, then you need to hurry, regardless of whether you switch to Android or not ... You will need to first put everything in order on BB (Big Brother), and then quietly enter your login and password into the Google Phone you bought and enjoy flying ... <br><br>  IMHO <i><b>Transition Plan</b></i> should be implemented as follows: <br>  1. Go to Gugloservisy. <br>  2. Adjust WM phone for them. <br>  3. Change habits / get rid of excess.  (so it can take a lot of time). <br>  4. Press the "big green button" in the newly purchased Google Phone. <br><br>  Next will go above the announced <u>plan from points 1 to 2</u> in the context of the content type: <br><br>  By the way, a significant advantage of Android over WM (except G1), is that it can be synchronized simultaneously with MS Exchahge and Gugloservis.  On WM it is impossible to do this without dancing with tambourines, since  By default, WM cannot synchronize two Exchange accounts at once.  You need to understand that with a WM device, synchronization with Google Service is only possible via the MS Exchange protocol. <br>  It's a pity: I, for example, had to abandon the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãreceiving work mail on the phone (access by POP3 and IMAP is closed by evil administrators) in the name of using personal Gmail, by the way, not only because of Gmail itself, but how much from the desire to centralize the storage of contact information. <br><br>  <b>post office</b> <br>  Gmail and that says it all.  Do not do anything.  Although not ... <br>  Point 4 and 5 must still be fulfilled !!!  If for some reason you do not have Gmail (uh, no son ... it's fantastic !!!), then you: <br>  1. <a href="http://mail.google.com/mail/e-11-1168a41a0412a980ae3804e02fb6f4df-9c64c3e37f073718079c82d56917a94c44ea5630%26type%3D2">You MUST REGISTER GMAIL</a> <br>  2. Follow the <a href="http://mail.google.com/support/bin/answer.py%3Fanswer%3D21288">instructions to</a> configure the mail collector. <br>  3. Gmail sucks the contents of your mailbox from a <s>goof-</s> other service. <br>  If you do not do this, then further content loses its full meaning, however, like the idea to buy Android. <br>  4. Go <a href="http://www.google.com/support/mobile/bin/answer.py%3Fanswer%3D138636%26cbid%3D-ishz4kd6rbk2%26src%3Dcb%26lev%3Danswer">here</a> and set up your WM to synchronize via MS Exchange and <br>  5. Rejoice! <br>  Note: if after synchronization you still want to set up your MS Exchange work mail, then take a beer box and ask the admins to open access via POP3.  (or set the rule to forward emails on Gmail - which is a crooked solution in general) <br>  Note2: after you refuse to synchronize via MS Exchange with a working account, you will not be able to use: a working calendar, a work address book, a global reference book of addresses, and tasks ... Solve ... Details ... more ... <br><br>  <b>Contacts</b> <br>  Everything is simple: <br>  In the event that you synchronize via USB / BT, then you do not need to do anything.  Everything has already happened. <br>  in case you synchronize via MS Exchange: <br>  1. <a href="http://mail.google.com/support/bin/answer.py%3Fhl%3Dru%26answer%3D12118">Export from Outlook</a> . <br>  2. <a href="https://mail.google.com/support/bin/answer.py%3Fhl%3Dru%26answer%3D8301">Import the file into Gmail</a> <br>  I checked the downloaded data for integrity and availability of all the data in the fields is full and I had no errors ... Photos are lost ((( <br><br>  <b>The calendar</b> <br>  In the event that you synchronize via USB / BT, then you do not need to do anything.  Everything has already happened too. <br>  in case you synchronize via MS Exchange: <br>  Because  Birthdays in Googleblock are sucking up perfectly from contacts, in order to avoid duplication of birthdays: <br>  1. Delete all contacts from the address book (you have already transferred them?).  Then you will need to use this instead of Outlook. <br>  2. Follow the <a href="http://www.google.com/support/calendar/bin/answer.py%3Fhl%3Dru%26answer%3D83126">instructions</a> for transferring calendar data from Outlook <br><br>  <b>Tasks</b> <br>  Everything is not so simple: <br>  Unfortunately, GoogleExchange does not yet support synchronization with this data type with Gmail, so you can make it easier: <br>  1. Go to Outlook <br>  2. Select the desired view (you can View =&gt; Current View =&gt; Active Tasks) <br>  3. Remove unnecessary columns =&gt; Ctrl + A =&gt; Ctrl + C <br>  4. Then go to Gmail =&gt; then <a href="https://mail.google.com/tasks/ig">mail.google.com/tasks/ig</a> =&gt; Ctrl + V <br>  5. And then with pens we transfer the execution dates from the name of the task to the deadline field.  If you have not 200 active tasks there, then it will not take more than 15 minutes.  At the same time there will be a reason to get rid of ‚Äúforgotten‚Äù tasks. <br>  By the way.  At first I didn‚Äôt like tasks from Google at all.  But then I tasted and refused Remember the milk in the hope that Google will soon implement task sharing.  (I didn‚Äôt like the implementation in RTGM on GoogleMoney ... Hanging a check mark and I need to direct it and wait for it to load ... I need to see everything on one screen at once).  In fact, the tasks from Google are very convenient ... Just there are a couple of points that need to be improved with a file ... <br><br>  <b>RSS feed</b> <br>  Being a fan of Google Readera (especially recently, when social chips were added there and Gears added, i.e. offline), I think that there are no alternatives to it.  Therefore, on mobile to use third-party software is impractical, because  then you never know what and where you are already lamenting, and uploading lists of rss after another killer is lazy.  Therefore, I added Reader to my bookmarks and read in Opere.  Everything is centralized and convenient (except for the metro).  Although the news between the stations, for example, loaded well ... <br><br>  <b>Books, Music, Video</b> <br>  So far, in order not to bother me, I copied a part of my library onto a USB flash drive in my phone and read when the opportunity arises ... <br>  I rarely watch music and videos ... <br>  When DropBox appears on Android and WM will be ubiquitous happiness))) <br>  There is an option, of course, to use Google Docs for storage of books, but you yourself know that you won‚Äôt upload books more than 10 megabytes, and you don‚Äôt read them in the metro, because  The mobile version of Reader is not yet implemented by Gears. <br><br>  <b>A photo</b> <br>  I use picas.  It's comfortable.  Therefore, I do not need to do anything to go to Andoid. <br>  How do I transfer pictures without a wire? <br>  In setting up picas there is a function: send photos by email.  Specify the desired "secret address" and photos from the phone do not forget to send to this address. <br><br>  <b>SMS</b> <br>  Due to the frequent demise of WM, I got tired of backing up separate SMS messages and I just got used to not storing important information in them.  I immediately write down phone numbers, addresses - to contacts, other - copy-mail to mail ... Therefore, for me, sms don't matter, but you, dear% username%, can offer the following elegant solution: <br>  1. Download <a href="http://www.jeyo.com/godownload.asp%3Fdlfile%3DJeyoMobileExtender.2.5.WM.zip">utility Jeyo</a> .  (it is free - you can use it for 15 days, but that‚Äôs enough time for us;) (You can still sign up for MS sync live with a fly or something like that, but I haven‚Äôt tried it. It is unlikely that it will be faster) <br>  2. Install it in Outlook <br>  3. Connect the device via ActiveSync.  Synchronize with Outlook <br>  4. Forward to Gmail <br>  5. And then everything is just like that of people: what‚Äôs in contacts, what‚Äôs the task, what label to mark with an asterisk ... Smsk is important to you either as information or as a memory of a person, event, and not because it is stored on your device in the SMS folder? <br>  Unfortunately, I have never had black lists of sms, because  never had problems with spam sms ... Strange ... Maybe offer a solution? <br><br>  <b>Notes</b> <br>  I have the same thing with notes ... I don‚Äôt use them ... (requirement # 4 - notes are not synchronized via MS Exchange) <br>  I developed a habit if I need to make a note, then I send a letter to myself.  ;) And then everything is like in humans ... An additional type of content (note) is an additional haemorrhoid in managing these contents <br><br>  <b>Favorites</b> <br>  On BB (big brother) previously used Google Bookmarks <a href="http://www.google.com/bookmarks/">www.google.com/bookmarks</a> in FF (Firefox), then with the advent of bookmark synchronization on Chrome switched to chrome, and of course on their new bookmark synchronization service (which is reflected in Gdocs).  Unfortunately, these services duplicate each other ... Do not tell me the solution? <br>  When I used Google tabs, there were no problems ... I made this page the main one in Mobile Opera (it loads quickly) and that's it.  And now for now, there are no ideas how to implement this correctly in WM. <br>  There is a cool service <a href="http://lastpass.com/">LastPass.com</a> .  For one dollar a month (real pennies), you can get a Premium account and then you will be able to synchronize with mobile devices ... I have not tested it yet, because  This service does not support Chrome (everyone is waiting for Chrome API for extension stable), and I don‚Äôt want to look at Mozilla (throw eggs around me again).  Therefore, as soon as LastPass announces an expansion for chrome, I will definitely buy a premium, and test it, and report back to you. <br><br>  Now <u>point 3 of the plan</u> : Get used to ... <br><br>  I wrote an article and understood that it doesn‚Äôt match the title a bit (it describes more the transition to Google services), but this is the point ... <br>  My opinion is to build a personal information management system that will be simple and multiplatform;) And thank you very much for letting Google do this. <br><br>  And now <u>4 point plan</u> : <br>  We buy Googlephone and press the "big green button" <br><br>  PS All voiced above are not a panacea for all ills ... This is just my vision. <br><br>  PS A fly in the ointment: I don‚Äôt have Androyd yet, so the article does not have my opinion on the usability of this or that on Andoid.  In statements about Android, the author took information from open sources.  As well as the author sincerely believes that all Google Android services are supported much better than on WM.  It remains for me to implement only the fourth point of the plan;) </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/71368/">https://habr.com/ru/post/71368/</a></p>
