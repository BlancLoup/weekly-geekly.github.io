  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Programming the human nervous system</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  7 years ago, while teaching Hustle (social pair dance), I ran into a problem in the older group of my students.  We have already come to the study of complex supports, where the execution technique is important so as not to hurt the back and knees. <br><br>  It was perfect to put the pair on the mirror perfectly, but during the dance all the beautiful and safe lines in the pair broke, I had to stop the music and put on the right technique again. <br><br>  As a neurologist, I could not simply ignore the errors in the support technique, because every time my heart sank, seeing dangerous movements.  One day, leafing through my notes on bodily psychotherapy, I came across a short phrase: "The Feldenkrais Method for Dancers, Actors ...".  - Yeah!  For dancers!

All the complex supports began to be performed with even backs and sharp lines.  Without a mirror, without my shouts, simply and naturally. <br><br>  Training for a somatic teacher, translation of books for professionals, hundreds of students since that time made a real revolution in my mind.  The level of understanding and skills was replaced by the level of conscious behavior.  Mechanical knowledge of neurophysiology, kinesiology, ergonomics began to play with completely different colors of a sense of the applicability of this knowledge to itself. <br><br>  <b>How does the proper programming of the nervous system work?</b> <br><br>  You can learn to turn your head correctly for years.  In our culture there are a lot of semantic traps that lie in completely unexpected places.  For example, the instruction: ‚Äúturn your head left and right.‚Äù  Try turning your head and notice how easy and far you can do it. <br><br>  Now, while turning your head, try stroking your cheek near the corner of your mouth with your fingertip on the side of the turn.  The volume of movement and comfort increase significantly, there is more coherence and agility in the movement itself. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/0aa/565/725/0aa565725079428393bbf129b2ef1f7f.jpg"></div><br><br>  What happened?  Just by default, the instruction to turn the head is perceived as if the head and the neck should be involved in this turn, the rest of the body should be motionless. <br><br>  From a biomechanical point of view, this is completely ineffective and leads to increased wear of the joints and intervertebral discs in the neck.  You can tell as many times as you want to include the whole body in motion, but simply by stroking your cheek you will achieve more - one of the most basic reflexes turns on, the search reflex of the newborn and the whole body are automatically included in the search for the maternal breast. <br><br>  The inclusion of the thoracic and lumbar spine, pelvis in the movement can relieve the neck and give more relaxedness and freedom.  It‚Äôs better to feel once inside than to see 100 times and to hear 10,000 times. <br><br>  <b>March 25th seminar in Moscow ‚ÄúProgramming the human nervous system‚Äù</b> <br><br>  What will happen at the seminar: <br><br>  ‚Ä¢ Current knowledge of the neurophysiology of human learning, supported by the practice of using this knowledge <br>  ‚Ä¢ The process of formation of skills, mechanisms of formation of a specialist and master <br>  ‚Ä¢ Trigger points.  Why do painful points appear in muscles and their attachment points, biological meaning, how they are related to the quality of movements.  How to get rid of chronic pain in the muscles. <br>  ‚Ä¢ Neurophysiology of the mechanism of procrastination, why important things are not done <br>  ‚Ä¢ Theory of biofeedback loops - calligraphic handwriting in 10 minutes <br>  ‚Ä¢ Theory of functional systems - accelerates reading speed by 2 times in 5 minutes <br>  ‚Ä¢ NLP and the ‚Äúanchoring‚Äù mechanism - why it works and how to use it properly <br>  ‚Ä¢ Is there free choice?  Consciousness and subconsciousness as the phenomena of freedom of choice <br>  ‚Ä¢ How reflexes actually work.  Why it is impossible to lengthen the muscle mechanically by stretching it. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/7ff/5e1/19c/7ff5e119c12a447592b479d2f65c20c9.JPG" alt="Who is leading, and what does he know to float our brains?"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/6f3/3d7/ffc/6f33d7ffcd0d425e9bf1e1d1bf7dbee1.jpg" align="left" width="320">  I am Dmitry Spitsyn - a neurologist practicing since 2002, the first certified teacher of somatics in Belarus.
