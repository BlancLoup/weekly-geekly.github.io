Not so long ago, Beeline organized an excursion-departure for the masters - to show how clients connect to the Internet via FTTB.  I tried to make a brief summary of what was told at the meeting.  Those who are familiar with the work of home Internet providers in general and Beeline Home Internet in particular, I think, will not be very interesting.  And to all the rest - welcome to habrakat! <a name="habracut"></a><br><br><h4>  Do you know that: </h4><br><h5>  People </h5><ul><li>  Beeline has more than 2,600 installers working in Russia, including 700 in Moscow. </li><li>  Assembly crews use personal vehicles to move around the city. </li><li>  New installers are usually charged with the first floors (the most dreary, given that the Beeline equipment is located in attics) and complex challenges, which helps to quickly weed out those who have a nervous system not strong enough for this job. </li><li>  Those who have passed the selection, depending on their abilities and personal qualities, earn from 30 to 150 thousand rubles per month. </li><li>  A strong nervous system is in fact needed: installers on duty are waiting for the police to drive (as a rule, on the basis of "some terrorists climb into the attic with suitcases"), dead bums in the attics (well, at least not zombies), threats of beatings (real case: the installer was in tenacious paws rather specific characters, and he had to prove with the knife thrown to his throat that he was really, really, here only the Internet pulls, and he did not hear about any dark deeds) and even the harassment of elderly nymphs  decoy (who can order IPTV the next day and ask to send the same installer). </li><li>  The installer will receive payment for his labor only when the client connected to him puts the money on his balance for the first time.  If two months after the estimated date of connection money from the client did not come, the installer will never be paid for it :-( </li><li>  Speaking of money: the connection for the client is strictly free.  Particularly inventive installers who hang customers noodles on their ears and take money from them for the connection, waiting for a refund to the client, a fine of 6 thousand rubles and dismissal in disgrace.  Big Brother is watching you, bro. </li><li>  Beeline has two levels of technical support: for normal people and for teapots.  There is also a secret, third level for complete humanists, but it is paid. </li></ul><br><br><h5>  Equipment </h5><ul><li>  Beeline is, to put it mildly, a key cable buyer from several factories in China. </li><li>  Twisted pair is centrally imported from China to Moscow, and further transported to the regions - so cheaper! </li><li>  The cost of buying a twisted pair account for about 98% of all costs for inventories used when connecting customers. </li><li>  Beeline buys only copper cable;  copper-clad is not used, with the exception of a few cities of presence. </li><li>  The braid on the cable is quite tough, but it has its drawbacks: it withstands only one broach, after which it bursts.  So, if you need to re-stretch the cable, it will not work, you have to take a new one. </li><li>  Sometimes equipment from lofts is stolen.  Tellingly, these trades are mostly not bums or drug addicts, but regional brothers in the workshop.  This problem is particularly acute in the cultural capital. </li></ul>

    <h5>  Process </h5><ul><li>  In good, for broaching you need access to low-voltage risers at least one floor.  When the risers are locked in vestibules, and the local population is not in a hurry to open them, great difficulties can arise up to the transfer of work to another time.  In case of emergency, various improvised means can be used for broaching, but we will not consider them in detail here :-) </li><li>  In clinical cases, Beeline is laying its risers, but this can adversely affect the strength of the building, so if possible they try to work in any other available way, even to rent space for the channel from local providers, if they have already built their riser in this house. . </li><li>  The average client waiting time from the application to the connection is about 1 day;  This is one of the best indicators in the country, if you order a connection on a weekday.  With weekends it is more difficult: since on weekends the housing offices do not work and do not give keys to the attic, you must arrive and carry out a front draw from the attic to the floor of the client, and you can connect the client on the second exit on the ordered day.  And in order to have time to make this combination, the order must be left no later than Thursday morning. </li><li>  Pre-draw can also be used if the client needs to be connected in the evening (Beeline officially connects clients from 10:00 to 22:00 across the country).  The fact is that territorial entities in the Russian Federation have the right to set the time after which noisy work can be done and to impose fines to legal entities for non-compliance with this rule. </li></ul><br><br><h5>  Habrapost </h5><ul><li>  <a href="https://picasaweb.google.com/108227040494115696320/tUIMvD">Here</a> you can see a few sad pictures that I cracked from the mobile phone in the process. </li><li>  Thank you so much <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/users/ekaterinaturtseva/" class="user_link">EkaterinaTurtseva</a> for the organized excursion and for the help in compiling this report! </li></ul><br><br>  <b>Update</b> All the information in the post was provided by the Beeline staff on the <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/events/165/">tour</a> ;  I am not.  Therefore, I cannot check the information, I do not answer questions for technical support.
