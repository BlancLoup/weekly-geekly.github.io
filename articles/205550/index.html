I selected the best of them, which, in my opinion, will turn out to be particularly relevant in the framework of the recent statement ‚Äúabout the cancellation of links‚Äù by Yandex. <br><br>  Please note that each of the listed items is directly related to the optimization of the site, although this can not be said with a superficial glance.  More recently, the following logic was an axiom: better SEO - more sales.  Now the logic works in the opposite direction: more sales are better than SEO. <br><br>  Selected factors are a condition that the site is commercial in nature (after all, the algorithm will affect the commercial sites of the Moscow region).  In the absence of these items, search engines may perceive the site as an informational one, and as a result, it does not rank well for commercial requests.

      First I will list 12 factors and give them a brief description.  And at the end I will tell which of them are the most important and which are least often found on websites. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br><h4>  Reviews </h4><br>  Without acquaintance with the reviews now no more serious purchase is made: from a hairdryer to an apartment.  Usually reviews are read in cases where the purchase is one-time, and not repetitive.  More often you will find reviews about tours or fur coats than about milk or gasoline.  However, especially scrupulous mothers are ready for hours to discuss the quality of milk for the kids, and motorists who get on low-quality fuel no or no and look for reviews on the fuel of the recently opened gas station at home. <br>  Customer reviews can relate to individual products or services, and to the company as a whole.  The vast majority of companies will find a reason to post reviews on their site.  There are reviews even on the sites of drug clinics and funeral homes. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/d35/efd/5d8/d35efd5d8f635d018a81c545033425b0.jpg"><br><br>  Reviews can even be in audio format, like on the Yutinet website. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/230/fdf/b7b/230fdfb7b436a8ea369b9b541f28a25c.jpg"><br><br>  Reviews are important for two reasons: they strengthen the credibility of the company (sales factor) and increase the time spent on the site (ranking factor).  As you already understand, Yandex and Google take into account the presence of the ‚ÄúReviews‚Äù section when ranking. <br><br><h4>  Prices </h4><br>  It seems obvious that the price must be present on the selling sites.  However, some companies make a mistake by hiding prices using scripts (‚ÄúTo get a price, click on the button‚Äù) or by issuing them only on request. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/9de/e3d/123/9dee3d123bdd7c1504db82d3cc5f3d07.jpg"><br><br>  There is a real fear to show the price.  It does not make any sense, because by issuing a price after ritual dances with a tambourine, it will not look more attractive. <br>  There are only 2 ways of pricing: competitive and noncompetitive.  The price can be high and competitive if there is real value behind it.  Hiding the price means hinting to the client that it is high and uncompetitive, because in other cases there is nothing to hide. <br><br>  There are even trainings for those who are afraid to show prices. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/b28/cad/0ff/b28cad0ff3f0bcc3faea7d8108be7ff9.jpg"><br><br>  The client will run away in horror only in two cases: <br><br>  ‚Ä¢ Uncompetitive price <br>  ‚Ä¢ Inconvenient and non-informative site. <br><br>  Hiding the price, the company makes both mistakes at once. <br><br>  On the website of an online store or service price information should be visible. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/286/3dc/b66/2863dcb66de250e846e184a9bd201d8c.jpg"><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/47b/ff5/29f/47bff529f75c3695afdd43c9b85f040f.jpg"><br><br><h4>  Portfolio and clients </h4><br>  Another way to increase the credibility of the site is to place on it samples of completed projects and information about customers.  This factor also increases the level of trust and prolongs the time spent on the site. <br><br>  All projects and all customers cannot be listed.  Therefore, I recommend citing statistics: the number of completed works in areas, the total number of clients (if possible, also by industry). <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/a50/a31/b7e/a50a31b7e0b88340b90ba6a884b01115.jpg"><br><br>  In addition to customers in some cases it is useful to specify partners.  In a sense, the partners are also the company's clients, that is, those who have opted for this particular firm. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/0b0/13b/9f5/0b013b9f5e29f4f6afc7fb1d47146cb0.jpg"><br><br><h4>  Promotions and special offers </h4><br>  I recommend to allocate promotions and special offers in a separate section of the site.  And I really do not recommend engaging in ‚Äúcreative work‚Äù, inventing an original name for it.  For example, it took a long time to convince the owner of one site that the title ‚ÄúThis is interesting‚Äù is not the best for a page with shares.  Behind such a headline can hide anything.  Visitors to the site want simplicity and clarity, and search engines want to see the ‚ÄúPromotions‚Äù section.  Give them what they want, not your imagination. <br><br>  For sales purposes, I advise you to display the main special offers on the home page as a banner. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/b4e/c32/e34/b4ec32e343a58ee11c36e7eca2683fb1.jpg"><br><br><h4>  Section "About Company" </h4><br>  "About the company" - one of the main sections of any commercial site.  The main mistake of most companies is not in the absence of a section as such, but in the superficial and unconvincing information contained in it. <br><br>  This section should contain the following information: <br><br>  1. Company History <br>  2. Specialization <br>  3. Features and benefits to highlight differences from competitors <br>  4. Information about management and key experts, which is especially important for service companies. <br>  5. News <br>  6. Contact information of the press service <br>  7. Management Photos <br>  8. Photos from events <br>  9. Promotional materials: booklets, videos and photo shoots. <br><br>  Please note that points 5, 8 and 9 allow you to regularly update the information in the section, which has a beneficial effect on website promotion. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/de2/138/d18/de2138d184b56b9813523a645e120479.jpg"><br><br><h4>  Thanksgiving letters </h4><br>  A sales and promotion tool similar to reviews.  Its peculiarity is that it is most suitable for B2B companies.  Usually letters are laid out in scanned form.  The quality of the scan should be excellent so that the attached image can be enlarged and read the text. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/65a/f50/f69/65af50f6982d27582a0a8ba55c0b627d.jpg"><br><br><h4>  Feedback form or button "Order a call" </h4><br>  Certain types of business involve a long sales funnel.  The client makes a long decision, studying the information and consulting with the sellers.  A classic example of such a business is the installation of plastic windows. <br><br>  In this case, the client has to call several companies, which is quite tiresome.  The feedback form or the button ‚ÄúOrder a call‚Äù remove from it some of the troubles.  In addition, the company receives the contact information of a potential client for subsequent communication and repeat sales. <br><br>  In addition, this functionality improves behavioral factors. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/719/523/261/7195232618efd94714752cc97bdc0b02.jpg"><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/07a/b20/9f0/07ab209f0734cc97897153b4413c204e.jpg"><br><br><h4>  Online consultant </h4><br>  An online consultant is a program that allows you to consult a client without calling the office or writing to managers.  Instant counseling gives you the opportunity to immediately build contact with a potential client and improves the behavioral factor.  Service is important for every business, which is characterized by a long decision to purchase. <br><br>  Now there are many providers of the Online Consultant service; you can choose any one to your liking. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/ee9/51c/b8a/ee951cb8a1b04e09dbde0fabf0e48e6f.jpg"><br><br><h4>  Assistant in the selection of goods or services </h4><br>  The popular marketplace Yandex Market offers two types of helpers when choosing goods: Guru and Ready-made recipes.  Both greatly simplify the search and contribute greatly to the popularity of the service. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/232/d9a/9cc/232d9a9cc7a02e428b89e1020525ad55.jpg"><br><br>  This functionality is useful for online stores, and not only large, selling complex equipment.  Even a small site that specializes in Dead Sea cosmetics can help with choices.  For example, you can distribute cosmetics by skin type, purpose, the presence of fragrances and so on. <br><br><h4>  news </h4><br>  Above, I have already spoken about the usefulness of news in the section ‚ÄúAbout the Company‚Äù.  However, it is not necessary to place them there.  You can create a separate section with news or publish them in the company blog. <br><br>  Regular content updates are useful for website promotion.  In addition, with the help of news, you can announce promotions and new arrivals by sending them to the mailboxes of customers. <br><br>  How to get email addresses of customers?  For example, using the feedback form.  As you can see, everything is interconnected on the site and the presence of several elements creates a synergy effect, when a complex of elements gives a greater efficiency than the sum of each of them separately. <br><br>  In the section "About the Company" you can publish business news for partners, and information intended for the end user can be placed in other sections. <br><br>  B2B companies can also publish selected market news. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/3fb/dfb/523/3fbdfb5238ff4617dc60ae9fefb95bdd.jpg"><br><br><h4>  Legal data of the company </h4><br>  Element useful for online stores and B2B companies.  Increases the credibility of the company, showing that the site is registered to a real company and works in compliance with the law. <br><br>  Smaller online stores that have barely entered the market are especially strongly encouraged to implement this element. <br><br>  Particularly scrupulous companies even publish scan registration certificates. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/53d/aa4/815/53daa4815518e60cf2d02cd95cd9a52d.jpg"><br><br><h4>  Photos and videos </h4><br>  Much has been said about the importance of these content formats on a modern website.  The Internet is turning into a visual medium, which means less text and more visual information.  I do not recommend giving up texts, but I advise you to dilute them with photos and videos. <br>  They can be placed in separate sections, as well as illustrate articles and news. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/8ea/b53/4b3/8eab534b3ebd361a79e784b93f13a3c5.jpg"><br><br><h3>  What to choose? </h3><br>  Not every commercial site can afford the introduction of all these elements. <br><br>  <u>Most often the sites are devoid of the following important elements:</u> <br>  ‚Ä¢ Online consultant <br>  ‚Ä¢ Reviews <br>  ‚Ä¢ Promotions and special offers <br>  ‚Ä¢ Thanksgiving letters <br>  ‚Ä¢ Assistant in the selection <br>  ‚Ä¢ Photo and video <br><br>  <u>The greatest efforts will require points:</u> <br>  ‚Ä¢ Photo and video <br>  ‚Ä¢ News <br>  ‚Ä¢ Online consultant <br>  ‚Ä¢ Assistant in the selection <br><br>  <u>I recommend giving priority to the following points:</u> <br>  ‚Ä¢ Reviews <br>  ‚Ä¢ Prices <br>  ‚Ä¢ Portfolio <br>  ‚Ä¢ Promotions <br>  ‚Ä¢ About company <br>  ‚Ä¢ Thanksgiving letters <br>  ‚Ä¢ Photo and video </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/205550/">https://habr.com/ru/post/205550/</a></p>
