  <section class="page js-page"><h1>SEMANTIC WEB for the WORKING ONTOLOGIST</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  In this post I would like to talk about the literature on Web 3.0, more precisely about one of its best representatives - the book ‚ÄúSEMANTIC WEB for the WORKING ONTOLOGIST‚Äù. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  I'll start from afar.  I work part-time in the laboratory of semantic knowledge of Tomsk Polytechnic University.  Not so long ago, the supervisor recommended us this book, giving it a very flattering assessment. <br>  The more I read this book, the more I liked it (especially against the background of many other materials on this topic).  I wondered if a translation of this book into Russian was being prepared.  I am quite satisfied with the English version (for a number of reasons, I finally and irrevocably switched to reading technical literature exclusively in English), but I think the Russian community would not have been disturbed by such a book: after all, if there is little sensible literature in English via Semantic Web, then in Russian its even less. <br>  Having finished with Dean Allemang, one of the authors of the book, I found out that the Russian translation is not planned yet, but there is already a Korean one.  By the way, Korean language experts can purchase the translated edition <a href="http://book.naver.com/bookdb/book_detail.php%3Fbid%3D5266970">here</a> :) However, Dean stressed that he would be glad if he could organize the translation of the book into Russian.  He shared information that prompted the publisher to cooperate with the Korean side.  Quote from the correspondence: <br><br><blockquote>  Here's how we can start.  If you can collect it, I‚Äôm not sure if you can use it.  If that argument is convincing, then it might take on the project. </blockquote><br><br>  As a result of the correspondence in Daen, it was decided to try to organize the collection of requests for Russian translation.  Another quote:

    <blockquote>  If you are a Russian University, Industry or Government. <br><br>  It will be a big market.  For example, it can be used as a fundamental technology.  In the industry, it is a statement on the subject. <br><br>  In short, it‚Äôs a good chance to write a book. </blockquote><br><br>  In short, you need to send an email in English to dallemang@topquadrant.com containing a request for a Russian translation.  Letters from professors and industry leaders are especially welcome. <br><br>  To skeptics, this approach may seem delusional.  I fully support this point of view :) <br>  In my opinion, such difficulties are associated with publishing (with giants like Appress, Manning, Microsoft Press, etc., the translation process is much better).  Tell me, have you heard about the translated books of the Morgan Kaufmann publishing house?  Personally, I did not come across.  Although on the <a href="http://www.elsevierdirect.com/imprint.jsp%3Fiid%3D16">main page of the</a> publisher this can not be said: they have offices all over the world.  Strange ... <br>  Maybe the fact that the publisher does not see in this book bestseller.  Of course, the book is quite narrowly specialized, but the reviews about it are extremely positive.  I will give a couple of reviews: <br><br><blockquote>  ‚ÄúThe Missing Link: Hendler and Allemang's New Book.  It is a lot of help to a practitioner.  The book is very readable;  the examples are plentiful and easily understandable.  I've already been recommending students and pre-order this book ‚Äù- David McComb, President, Semantic Arts, Inc.  <a href="http://www.semanticarts.com/">www.semanticarts.com</a> <br><br>  ‚ÄúThis is a practice web site currently available, from a practitioner's point of view.  Beyond theory and hype.  You will get a clear understanding of what the RDF, RDF Schema and OWL are.  You will learn how to build and deploy ontologies ‚Äûin the trenches‚Äú?  Working for the Working Ontologist fills a much needed gap in the literature.  It is a group of sources that has been hitherto scattered at the W3C.  I expect to refer to this book often. "- Dr.  Michael Uschold, Internationally recognized in academia and industry. </blockquote><br><br>  Not bad, is it? <br>  If I managed to convince you, please send a letter to Dean.  You look, something will come out of this ... <br>  PS On the official website of the book, a <a href="http://www.workingontologist.org/Russian/">special section has been</a> created for the Russian translation, in which a general discussion is planned (but you should not post translation requests there). <br></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/51751/">https://habr.com/ru/post/51751/</a></p>
