Then for the first time the Windows was removed, and it went away.  And I was directly into programming at school when I did a visual basic encryption program at the beginning of 00 for the regional Olympiad. <br><br>  <b>What are you working on right now?</b> <br><br>  There are a lot of projects, mainly API for mobile devices, a lot of projects on rails, tasks with data migration from old systems to new ones, now I am working on my gem, which will allow you to conveniently import data from legacy system with different adapters using internal DSL and schemes.  As it turned out, there are no convenient analogues for this task.  I think by the end of the autumn to finish and put on the githab, because everyone knows that every self-respecting rubist should write his gem :).  In general, of course, the following principle in life is very important to me: if you take something from the open source community, you must give something to it. <br><br>  <b>What is the best and worst part of your job?</b> <br><br>  Of course for all of us, programmers, excitement is very important, with which we undertake the task.  I like the drive before the deadline, when you as a real stayer at the finish of the marathon of the last strength come to the finish line of your project.  And of course I appreciate the feeling of team unity that you experience in a difficult moment.  I love public speaking, sharing my knowledge with others.  I do not like the routine, I think, like all of us. <br><br>  <b>What do you consider your main achievement in life / career at the moment?</b> <br><br>  So far for me the main achievement in my career is moving from my hometown of Krasnoyarsk to Moscow.  This decision made it possible to make a serious leap in a career, because, as we know, ‚Äúbeing determines consciousness‚Äù.  If you are surrounded by professionals every day, then growth will not take long to wait.  I can not fail to mention that my performance at the Rails club is also one of my important achievements. <br><br>  <b>What is the purpose of your career and professional development?</b> <br><br>  The career goal is very blurred, the problem of goal-setting is always acute for each of us.  At this stage, I see myself not only in programming, I would like to try my hand at the junction of various subject areas.  I am very interested in economics and robotics. <br><br>  <b>What helps a programmer to grow professionally?</b> <br><br>  Of course, self-discipline.  You must always be in trend and at the same time not forget about fundamental knowledge (not only some kind of frameworks or new languages).  Well, as I have already noted, this is the team that surrounds you.  Many programmers neglect this, but the transfer of knowledge that exists within each team is probably the most important thing that can pump you through professionally. <br><br>  <b>What book would you recommend to read to any programmer?</b> <br><br>  If on the subject, then ‚ÄúK.Larman.  Application of UML and OOP templates ‚Äù, but I still want us programmers to read more fiction, so I advise everyone to read the book of I.Ilf and E.Petrov‚Äú The Golden Calf ‚Äù. <br><br>  <b>What do you like to do when you don't write code?</b> <br><br>  I play musical instruments: a piano, a guitar, and now I am fond of a harmonica.  Of course, sports and I love teaching people programming.  I know a lot of people who are very afraid of this and think that they will fail, although they are very capable.  Show them how to easily get into this world, gives me great pleasure. <br><br>  <b>Thanks for the interview and see you in Moscow!</b> <br><br><h5>  The conference </h5><br>  We invite everyone to the RailsClub'Moscow 2013 conference. Traditionally, we will feed, give presents, hold contests and lotteries, play good music :) There will be a lot of interesting and informative. <br><br>  <a href="http://railsclub.timepad.ru/event/76008/%3Futm_refcode%3D95c73ccecc305e313977a72d1c6f02260353ae99">Registration and payment of participation in the conference</a> .
