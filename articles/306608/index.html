Today we want to tell you how the Yota support service is organized, what software we use and why our online consultants are never bored. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  The support of our mobile product is online.  We answer users' questions with the help of chat in the mobile application and on the website, in social networks and sms-chat.  The main channel of communication with the client is the Yota application, the chat built into it accounts for more than 50% of calls. <br><br><h3>  Soft </h3><br>  Previously, we used a software package based on LiveTex modified software for the support service.  With time, we no longer have enough opportunities, and we switched to a solution from <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genesys">Genesys</a> .  It was originally developed only for service calls, but over time has been improved, and now the system allows you to work with non-voice channels, such as chat, e-mail, SMS and social networks.

      The components of the system are written partly in Java, partly in the Genesys internal language.  The frontend and backend communicate with each other via the HTTPS protocol.  As part of the ‚Äúlong‚Äù HTTP session, there is an exchange of short request-response pairs. <br><br>  The system architecture includes 4 clusters (a total of 9 servers). <br><br><ul><li>  GMS-cluster: primary processing services for chat from a mobile application and web chat; </li><li>  DB cluster: GMS cluster component cache database; </li><li>  SocialMedia-cluster: drivers of interaction with the social networks API; </li><li>  Application-cluster: components of routing, administration and configuration;  statistics, interaction with operator consoles, etc. </li></ul><br>  Due to the clustering of each component, a high level of service availability is maintained. <br><br>  The scheme of interaction of components is designed in such a way as to minimize the mutual influence when processing various types of chats.  At the same time, it remains possible to customize the routing of calls to support service operators from different channels and in a single interface.  The modularity of the system and the flexibility of settings allow you to continuously introduce new features, while simultaneously optimizing the already configured routing. <br><br><h3>  Interface </h3><br>  The main working tool of support service operators is a software console, a virtual desktop integrated with CRM Yota.  When a person gets a job in the Yota support service, we separately check that his computer can work with a set of corporate software tools. <br><br>  The remote displays: <br><br><ul><li>  Single client window (EOK): CRM system interface, in which the operator can view information on the client in a convenient format (his personal data, connected tariffs and services, balance, all requests and requests from the client and the very history of correspondence) </li><li>  Chat queue; </li><li>  Personal statistics of the operator; </li><li>  Office chat with other operators. </li></ul><br><br>  Appeal user enters the chat distribution system.  All customer calls come from here: from the chat of a mobile application, from the chat on the site, from SMS, etc. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/18e/a87/8fc/18ea878fc5ac47e09b6cfa16f44b2541.png"><br><br>  Appeal is transmitted to one of the free operators.  The system is set up so that the client, if possible, gets to the operator with whom he has already communicated.  When the operator accepts the message, the EOK loads: <br><br><ul><li>  the whole history of correspondence with the client, </li><li>  information about its operating system </li><li>  mobile app version </li><li>  product used - mobile communication, internet for smartphone / tablet, modem, </li><li>  current fare, </li><li>  the region in which the user is located, and other data. </li></ul><br>  This significantly speeds up the solution to the problem that the user contacted.  The operator does not need to search for data and repeat what has already been found out during previous calls. <br><br>  If we know that in some city there are failures in the network, then the system will automatically notify the user in the chat while he is waiting for the operator to respond. <br><br>  To determine the effectiveness of the support service, we use all sorts of statistical reports - real-time and historical, for the construction of which we use the standard tools of the Genesys package, as well as data upload via the API to the business intelligence system. <br><br><h3>  Automation support service </h3><br>  Since last year, we began to introduce elements of automation.  When a user enters the chat of a mobile application, he first gets into the so-called prechat (in fact, this is a FAQ).  A set of questions in the FAQ is dynamically formed depending on whether it is a current client or a potential one, what product it uses, what region it is in.  If the user does not find an answer to his question here, he contacts the operator in the chat. <br><br>  Future plans - the introduction of a full chat bot.  The idea is this: when contacting support chat, the user first enters the chat bot, which conducts semantic analysis of user messages, determines the subject.  The bot can answer simple questions or immediately transfer the call to the operator.  This will help to process appeals faster, remove some of the workload from operators, and users will not have to wait in line. <br><br>  We want chat chat to differ little from human operators.  We will not hide the fact that this is a machine, but at the same time we hope to ‚Äúhumanize‚Äù it as much as possible and make the dialogues more alive. <br><br><h3>  People and Statistics </h3><br>  Many chat staff members retrained from our telephone support service, but from time to time we recruit new employees.  First, candidates are phased in: testing for technical skills and literacy;  telephone interview;  role-playing test-drive via Skype, in which support staff imitate customer behavior and check how the candidate communicates in ‚Äúcombat‚Äù conditions.  The last stage is a conversation with the future leader.  For beginners, a two-week course is conducted: studying our products, then an internship stage under the supervision of an experienced curator, and - as a result - an extensive one-day exam. <br><br>  The team of our operators is distributed in four cities: St. Petersburg, Ufa, Samara and Kazan.  Like the users themselves, the experts are in different time zones, which allows you to evenly distribute the load.  Almost all operators work from home, so they are not tied to the office schedule, and can communicate with users in the early morning, late evening and night.  The most active users are from 11 to 18 hours. <br><br>  Our online consultants come to the rescue in the most extreme situations: when the Empire is in danger or the tank does not go into battle.  As proof, real dialogs (spelling and grammar saved): <br><br>  <b>Darth Vader</b> : Can you please tell me how long the Internet will be unavailable to my planet ???  Sith worried))) device is not registered <br>  <b>Operator</b> : Good afternoon, Dark Mister! <br>  <b>Operator</b> : At the moment, there are difficulties with entering your personal account.  Droids are already working on the issue.  Sorry, please try again in half an hour. <br>  <b>Darth Vader</b> : Thank you, young Padawan :) The Sith have regained their composure <br>  <b>Operator</b> : Princess Amidala wishes good. <br>  <b>Operator</b> : Have a nice day, start without overloads and fewer black holes in your path. <br>  ___________________ <br><br>  <b>Operator</b> : As for the test, you are fine.  Which server do you play?  Not 3 or 7? <br>  <b>Maxim</b> : 1, 5. Departures every fight, after 30 seconds, then I return to the battle if I am alive, finish the game without any problems, ping is always up to 100, there are no questions about speed either.  But this is crap with departures for the second day. <br>  <b>Operator</b> : Uh, you have iron nerves.  Strange, with such indicators, I see no reason for departures.  And the Internet itself, that is, access to other resources, remains? <br>  <b>Maxim</b> : Yes, everything works fine.  The ping test on the WOT server did not show a single gap for 30 minutes, but, bl, from the battle I somehow fly out.  Wargaming referred to the provider. <br>  <b>Operator</b> : It's funny, I wanted to refer you to WoT tech support.  I had such a problem after the update, if HellCat was on the map, but it was fixed during the day and the problems were only on the improved engine, the kind of problem with the tank model itself, threw it out of the application with the crit.  But here is a slightly different situation. <br>  <b>Operator</b> : Maxim, for our part, I do not see any problems with access.  Even the base station checked, despite the fact that the Internet works well, it also works in normal mode. <br>  <b>Maxim</b> : Can XVM MOD be the reason for the departure? <br>  <b>Operator</b> : Hmm, on the theory of course it can, but I did not try to put it personally, I can not say for sure. <br>  <b>Maxim</b> : Yes, I understand that this is not your mistake.  Sorry for being too emotional. <br>  <b>Operator</b> : It's okay, I understand you :) I hope everything will work out soon. <br>  <b>Maxim</b> : Thank you.  Good luck. <br>  ___________________ <br><br>  <b>Master Yoda</b> : Good day, young Padawan.  Tell me, be nice, static or dynamic IP <br>  <b>Operator</b> : The problem of life is <br>  We have a network of nat.  Persons <br>  There will be no external addresses <br>  Quite <br>  <b>Master Yoda</b> : Sadness, trouble, well.  M-yes. <br>  <b>Master Yoda</b> : We will change you then <br>  <b>Operator</b> : However, if jur.  Face <br>  You connect to us then <br>  The service you need is <br>  400r <br>  <b>Operator</b> : <a href="http://www.yota.ru/b2b">www.yota.ru/b2b</a> <br>  <b>Master Yoda</b> : only 400 rubles, I hope the Russians, I‚Äôm a Jew <br>  <b>Master Yoda</b> : I understand you, hurray, hurray decided to address the cases) <br>  ___________________ <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/14e/6cf/1fd/14e6cf1fd5654c06a328a8815994815f.png"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/c35/92d/bb2/c3592dbb2a684ee0b9ff7cd3b2b36a22.png"><br><br>  ___________________ <br><br>  <b>User</b> : Great!  Next month, everything also remains or need to re-connect? <br>  <b>Operator</b> : Everything will remain :) <br>  <b>User</b> : Great.  A little joke to tell a joke? <br>  <b>Operator</b> : Call accepted.  Joke nicely such.  Lost dog, without one back leg.  Special features: When pissing - falls. <br>  ___________________ <br><br>  <b>User</b> : do not know the account REAL-BARUSSIYA? <br>  <b>Operator</b> : One minute :) <br>  <b>Operator</b> : 1-0 in favor of Real, Benzema was given to quietly take the ball on the flank, turn around and shoot into the penalty area on Karvahala, who, in turn, gently rolled out the "projectile" Bey-lu.  Gareth did not meet on the part of the defenders at all no resistance, but because of the touch pushed the ball under the falling goalkeeper. <br>  <b>Operator</b> : Do you still have questions, Alex? <br>  <b>User</b> : Thank you so much!  Great service!!!  Respect <br>  <b>Operator</b> : Glad to try for you!  Good evening and victory for your team. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/306608/">https://habr.com/ru/post/306608/</a></p>
