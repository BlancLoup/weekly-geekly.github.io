  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Good hosting does not happen much or OVH goes to Russia</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Anyone who has ever been puzzled by the search for a dedicated-server, probably heard about the French company OVH, which provides hosting, VPS, Dedicated, as well as some other services.  However, to register as a client, you must be a resident of one of the countries on the list, in which Russia, alas, does not (with one small exception, in more detail under the cut). <br><br><a name="habracut"></a>  I have long been a client of this company and slowly doing reselling, I always dreamed about the possibility of direct payment from Russia, without having to contact friends to order a new server. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/a98/8eb/a9f/a988eba9fffae9df3a089cce4588a7dc.jpg" alt="OVH Logo"></div><br>  The system just can not be fooled by specifying the country from the list, you need a mobile phone number from the selected location.  But here it is not so simple.  Even if you have a SIM card from one of the foreign operators, at the time of payment you may be asked for a utility bill (something like an electricity bill in Russia), which is harder to get.

      Attempts to come to an agreement with a technical support employee have come to naught, but he gave one useful advice.  On his instructions, I turned to the Lithuanian branch of OVH, where an interesting conversation had already taken place. <br><br>  On the OVH website in Lithuania, there is an opportunity to register as a client from Russia, but with a small nuance: the only method of payment is a bank transfer through Swedbank.  After talking with the representative offices of banks, it turned out that money can be transferred from Russia only from the Russian branch of Swedbank, moreover, only in the national currency of Lithuania, and they ask a rather high percentage for conversion. <br><br>  It was about a year ago.  Long and painfully communicating with the employees of the Lithuanian branch of OVH, I had to talk about Russian payment systems, which are most actively used and how it would be more convenient to pay, after which I was told that now they need to work out a detailed scheme of work in Russia before providing services on its territory.  On that the development of events and ended. <br><br>  But more recently, the Lithuanians remembered us again.  The message was rather brief, but, nevertheless, completely explaining everything at once (I quote): <br><br><blockquote>  this is the ordering process. </blockquote><br>  So get ready.  Most likely, this summer the choice of hosting providers will expand, and everyone will be able to appreciate this wonderful data center in France, without resorting to the services of third parties. <br><br>  PS&gt; inspired by the sudden dying of the Caravan (yes, we also have servers there ...) </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/116591/">https://habr.com/ru/post/116591/</a></p>
