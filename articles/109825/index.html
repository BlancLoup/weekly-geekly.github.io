  <section class="page js-page"><h1>And I love tenders!</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Judge for yourself, how great it is to pay less and get more.  Fantasy?  Not at all.  The whole hysterical howl around the state system.  trades in the Russian Federation, the state procurement site and the gold saw are raised either by those who have their own sawing too small and have failed to stick to the juicy oil or minestre pie, or those who are not able to work on a competitive basis at all.  94-FZ guys - this is real gold!  Whole, you can even say, Klondike.  After all, the tender is not just a certain ritual.  The main value is that it forces all the participants of the process to move with force of compulsion: the customer is obliged by law to annually evaluate the market in search of the best, and sellers have the right to challenge his choice and offer their options.  And accounting does not whine.  More precisely, whining, but it does not bother anyone at all. <br><br>  Take, for example, our university, the oldest and largest in the region.  In 2006, if memory fails, we paid for the Internet at 3 rubles per megabyte at a speed in the region of one megabit, and now we give 25,000 p.  per month for 20 full Mbps.  Great, right?  Yes, not the word!  Would this happen without annual service contests?  I am not sure: it is unlikely that the accounting department would constantly renew the contract, finding a thousand reasons covering its own laziness.  Yes, and providers regularly try to press or change the conditions in their favor. ... But here, like a little devil from a snuffbox, 94-FZ comes into the world and acts on someone better than other pills or medicine for greed. <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  If you look at the picture as a whole, then the tender mechanism opens the state.  sector road to the world of SaaS.  And not only such that in all domestic magazines they are praised by insane, illiterate and easy money-hungry markeoids: they say buy our Exchange * for $ 40 per person and dismiss, finally, your unwashed admin (* - we are not responsible for anything, but smoking generally harms your health).  Everything is much, much more interesting, because SaaS does not work that way.  The customer does not need your mythical ‚ÄúExchange‚Äù, he needs to save his money.  What a surprise, however!  Play wider.  And we will definitely take your service for rent, especially if for us it actually (and not in the promotional presentation) will be profitable.

      And again an example from life.  The citywide network of our university is based on IaaS.  Each year, the university announces a competition for the provision of services, providers play in front of each other, reduce prices;  We get great service for reasonable money and no headaches about cables, equipment, crazy excavators, flying trees or outdated SFPs.  Do you know how much we pay for a hygiene network with QoS and QnQ within the city?  Look in the archive site <a href="http://zakupki.gov.ru/">zakupki.gov.ru</a> - this is not a secret.  And it turns out that in different parts of the city we have a better connection than inside the campus, where until now the P-296 hangs in places.  Miracles and only. <br><br>  There is, however, a mechanism for bidding and its big drawbacks, they are nowhere without them.  It is necessary to learn how to make tender documentation.  Very, very, very good study.  They are suppliers, so sweet, so kind, so clever, so savvy, that instead of using IBM System P they are trying to cram Depo, for example, and D-Link instead of ProCurve.  You can also forget about vacation time / leave during trading and after during commissioning, this is from the realm of fantasy.  Yes, and four fiber cables on the facade of the main building do not look very, this is a problem, a problem, for this they do not pat on the head.  But to refuse to bid after all that has been done and what is yet to come ... No, you cannot afford this. <br><br>  We still have an idea, but only in Russia, for the time being, unfortunately, it is not at all feasible - to bring to hell on IaaS all the printer facilities of the university.  This would actually be very, very cool: there are no problems with constant refills, with cartridges, loose rollers and without the need to torture personnel and plan the load on the equipment.  Oh, dreams! <br><br>  And yes, do not forget that our State is the most reliable and profitable buyer, because the contract or the state.  The contract is concluded for a specified period during which neither the supplier nor the buyer has the right to change the terms of service, including the price.  And in the conditions of our swirling market, the stability of the length of a year is expensive.  Friends, count money, look for or offer decent services, improve the quality of customer service and finish searching for a black black saw in a black black room, especially if it is not there. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/109825/">https://habr.com/ru/post/109825/</a></p>
