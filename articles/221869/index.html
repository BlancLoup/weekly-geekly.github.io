Task about smart watches</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  On the eve of the <a href="https://russiandesigncup.ru/">Russian Design Cup 2014,</a> we offer to recall and analyze the tasks and solutions of last year's championship.  In particular, we will tell about the most interesting works and their authors. <br><br>  The power of Habr is that his community consists of many different specialists: designers and web designers, front-end and backend programmers.  We invite you to discuss the best problem solving with RDC members.  Designers will tell about their findings and how they came to them, about the difficulties they encountered.  We will go through the three most interesting tasks of the Cup, and today we will start with the task of the clock. <br><br>  <i>‚ÄúLarge companies presented new devices, so-called smart watches.</i>  <i>They interact with smartphones via Bluetooth LE.</i>  <i>It is also known that many buyers already return them back, not finding their use.</i>  <i>Imagine the concept of an application of any social network for such hours that people do not want to return them.</i>  <i>What features and capabilities will you put on the watch?</i>  <i>Ok, about notifications about new messages, we already know. "</i>

      <b>1. Ayrat Gafiyatullin</b> , top 10 participants. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/efc/783/670/efc783670cb6dbef8f26abd912a4eda6.png"><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  <a href="https://russiandesigncup.ru/tour2/task1/">Full version of the solution</a> <br><habracut><br><blockquote>  It was a simple task.  Given the fact that I am quite skeptical about using watches for something else besides showing time, it was not difficult to discard inappropriate services and social networks.  Vkontaktiki and facebooks immediately flew into the furnace, there was a thought about Instagram, but I imagined how stupid it would be to build a frame looking at the clock, and abandoned this idea, although I saw that some guys really believe in it.  He stopped at the Foursquare chekin, as the simplest and most suitable functionality for watches.  In the appendage made Badu, to demonstrate to others "state of the soul."  If I had been performing the task now, I would have thrown out the second solution about Badu and left only Foursquare.  The main thing that I wanted to lay in the application - simplicity, adequacy and feasibility. <br><br>  From the work of competitors liked the <a href="https://russiandesigncup.ru/tour2/task1/">decision of Julia Matyunina</a> . </blockquote><br><br>  <b>2. Alexey Antonov,</b> 2nd place <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/8ec/812/930/8ec8129305269062029097952e733e7b.png"><br><br>  <a href="https://russiandesigncup.ru/tour2/task1/">Full version of the solution</a> <br><br><blockquote>  First of all, the idea was, relying on the restrictions imposed by the device and considering the functionality of the selected social network, to provide users with an easy way to perform actions for which smart watches are suitable: to write comments ‚Äî no, but to post a photo ‚Äî please;  To view the tape with text and photos is not very convenient on this screen, and making calls inside ‚ÄúOK‚Äù or changing music is easy. <br><br>  The second idea was to add to the application functions that use the unique features and form factor of the device, and which, at the same time, may be of interest to a part of the social network audience (for the most part, they will justify the expediency of a perfect purchase in the eyes of the owners of the first generation smart watches).  Here the calculation was on geeks who will make up a significant part of the audience of the application. <br><br>  An important condition is a sufficient number of devices from users of the selected social network to develop the application was justified.  With it, it would be possible to occupy a niche of a progressive brand promoting technological innovations, study the audience of the application, analyze user behavior in order to properly plan the development under the ‚Äúsmart‚Äù hours of applications for other company projects (to maintain the knowledge base and share them in thematic articles on Habr√©) .  An important factor is getting another screen on which the user sees a recognizable brand (and on which there would be no competitors' applications at that time).  The application would solve the tasks of the user of the social network and help in achieving his personal goals - all in accordance with the conditions of the competitive task and, at the same time, solved my tasks within the framework of the competition. <br><br>  If I did now, I would try another idea: an application for the Instagram, the killer feature of which would be the kaleidoscope mode ‚Äî shaking the clock, got a new image from pieces of what the camera saw.  I would add the ability to select ready-made kaleidoscope effects and the ability to post it all in one tap: launched, shook, tapped - everything was preserved and published (the settings of the application are transferred to the smartphone).  Swipe down exits the application without publishing. <br><br>  Of the competitors I want to mention <a href="https://russiandesigncup.ru/tour2/task1/">Sergey Kiselev</a> , he has a thoughtful and complete concept. </blockquote><br><br>  <b>3. Alexander Kotov</b> , <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/users/mrkotov/" class="user_link">mrkotov</a> , top 10 participants. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/302/63a/cab/30263acab4016ffa1f057fa8c985a2ae.png"><br><br>  <a href="https://russiandesigncup.ru/tour2/task1/">Full version of the solution</a> <br><br><blockquote>  I tried to think as close as possible to reality, focused on existing models of watches.  From the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãcreating a new social network refused immediately, the watch simply does not have unique functions that could form its basis and attract a sufficient number of users.  Therefore, I chose the network with which I know best of all - Vkontakte, and tried to come up with scenarios that would be convenient to perform using the clock application.  The problem was that they were few, some included in their decision with a stretch.  Viewing notifications, for example, will be an unpopular function, because you still have to answer from a computer or phone.  Notifications on the phone and so annoying when you're near the computer, and then the clock will vibrate. <br><br>  Most of all I liked the feature with remote control of the camera's release, in order to take pictures of myself from the outside and take group pictures, this is really convenient and in demand.  Like audio management: it‚Äôs more convenient to browse tracks from hours when running or riding a bicycle, than from a phone. <br><br>  If I were solving the problem now, I would have made an addition to my friends through the touch of two hours, I really liked this idea from Olga Konovalova.  I also liked <a href="https://russiandesigncup.ru/tour2/task1/">the ‚ÄúPassport‚Äù function</a> , thanks to which the owners of the establishments see who comes to them.  Very competent use of NFC in the first case and Bluetooth LE in the second.  And Alexander Pavlov has a <a href="https://russiandesigncup.ru/tour2/task1/">cool HIGH5</a> in terms of branding and advertising. </blockquote><br><br>  <b>4. Sergey Kiselev,</b> top 10 participants <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/491/437/bb1/491437bb1f8a4aac127581d9376df24f.png"><br><br>  <a href="https://russiandesigncup.ru/tour2/task1/">Full version of the solution</a> <br><br><blockquote>  The first thing that had to be done was to study the market of smart watches, sort out the existing models, understand the principle of operation and evaluate the usefulness in everyday life.  After that, it became clear that in most cases, this new gadget doesn‚Äôt bring anything into life, but only copies (not even complements) a smartphone, which is most likely at your fingertips.  And we had to arouse the interest of the user and show that the gadget could be useful, so the favorite was chosen (at that time), which stood out from the rest thanks to the built-in camera. <br><br>  If I decided now, I would try to find an application for the application on smart watches without a camera (remote control, for example). <br><br>  I liked the idea of <a href="https://russiandesigncup.ru/tour2/task1/">mining Bitcoins</a> in Ivan Korzun.  Obviously, the application would hardly have been implemented, but the gamification process itself (complete the task - get a coin) could be adapted to something useful. </blockquote><br><br>  <b>Anton Tyulenev,</b> 1st place <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/71e/0f4/e8e/71e0f4e8eb68b57a17dd4174c0fc0747.png"><br><br>  <a href="https://russiandesigncup.ru/tour2/task1/">Full version of the solution</a> <br><br><blockquote>  First of all, I wanted to maximally simplify the interaction of a person with a gadget.  Watch is mobility, movement.  In passing glance, counted the information and run on.  All that requires thoughtful interaction, attention, is on the phone, there is more screen, more possibilities. <br><br>  Therefore, I wanted something simple and familiar, but slightly forgotten.  For example, a compass.  I chose the direction, I checked the arrow and go.  Well, I wanted to help the doubting guys to lift the burden of responsibility from their shoulders.  He trusted the occasion, pressed only one button and the clock led you to the dream.  Light whiff of chaos in a measured life does not hurt anyone.  The basis of my decision was the simplicity and straightforwardness of the script.  He clicked, came, checked in, it was impossible to make a mistake or get confused. <br><br>  The best of what other participants did, in my opinion, is that of <a href="https://russiandesigncup.ru/tour2/task1/">Sergey Kiselev</a> and <a href="https://russiandesigncup.ru/tour2/task1/">Olga Konovalova</a> . </blockquote><br><br>  Next week we will continue to ‚Äúplunge into the brains‚Äù of the best designers of the competition and analyze another task.  What do you think, which of the participants coped better with the solution of the proposed problem and why? <br><br>  PS Now we are actively working on the organization of the competition RDC 2014. Already decided on the prizes - they will be much more interesting than last year.  That only costs a new cylindrical Mac Pro.  Together with the contestants and the jury, we also compiled a list of the best design books that we would like to donate to those who will pass to the second round of this year.  We also plan to make this year a completely enchanting offline final and much more that you can learn about <a href="https://twitter.com/RDesignCup">on our Twitter</a> . </habracut></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/221869/">https://habr.com/ru/post/221869/</a></p>
