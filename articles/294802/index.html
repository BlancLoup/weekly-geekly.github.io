So how to become the person who attracts success?  This is a good question, and the answer is not as obvious as it may seem. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/a3c/6f7/11f/a3c6f711f3c34f0a9de314dd40deedd0.jpg"><br><br><h4>  The right bait for goldfish </h4><br>  Many would immediately advise you to work hard, plan your next steps, and persevere toward your goal.  Yes, of course, one cannot do without it, but let's remember how many of us are really hard at work, dream and struggle to make our dreams come true, but the cherished luck bird does not hurry to appear on the horizon.  Something is missing, something we have forgotten ... Missed factors do not allow all our efforts to develop into a path that will lead us to success. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  And it always seemed to me that we are pursuing success like prehistoric hunters pursuing a mammoth.  But it turned out that in the pursuit of success, homo sapiens cannot even think that, if we are worthy of success, he himself will accompany us, being a logical consequence of all our actions.  So everything is just the opposite - this success should haunt us.  After all, promising prospects and opportunities are what you attract to yourself.  We just need to work on making the bait worthwhile.

It is necessary to cultivate, and this should be done in the right direction.  Alas, as practice shows, it is not enough to be a class specialist, you need to be an attractive person who, like a magnet, attracts others to him, and with them the cherished keys to achieving goals.  No matter how trite it sounds, success is people.  It is they who create opportunities, they can be the key to victory or defeat. <br><br>  In today's world, information and connections are valued most.  Yes, it is communication that should never be neglected.  And so you need to work on yourself, develop all the skills that you already have, and acquire new ones, tirelessly polish every facet of your character, learn to communicate with people, look after your physical health, and mental harmony - then you will become a person who will attract others.  Your reputation will speak for itself - you will find people who are happy to want to build a business with you. <br><br><h4>  Trough theory </h4><br>  You can argue with me in this, but, as a rule, a person‚Äôs profit is proportional to his level of self-development (I judge this more by the realities of the life of the rotten capitalist west).  One very rich gentleman once uttered a wonderful phrase: ‚ÄúIf all the money of the world is divided equally between all people, then very soon they will find themselves in the same pockets in which they were previously buried.‚Äù <br><br>  Not everyone is able to take advantage of the enormous opportunities, even if they are knocking on the door, not all of us can multiply what we already have.  And so it is not easy to keep what was not acquired as a result of self-development.  Well, imagine that happiness fell into your head, for example, the glorious empire of Comrade Mask.  Believe me, only a few of us would be able to create something constructive with her, the majority would simply rush to the Bahamas for joy.  And wealth, like the omnipresent energy, would gradually pass into the hands of more intelligent people, whose level of self-development allows them to cope with the obligations and responsibilities with which big business is associated. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/43e/b57/15d/43eb5715d5e24cc99ce8d6e301f30618.jpg"><br><br>  Understand: who you will become is more important than any other benefit.  And instead of asking the questions ‚ÄúWhat benefits do I get?‚Äù, ‚ÄúWhat does it give me?‚Äù, Ask yourself another, most important question, ‚ÄúWho am I becoming?‚Äù.  These questions and the answers to them are closely intertwined - who we are becoming directly influences what benefits and prospects open up before us.  Look at it from a different angle: everything that we have now we have acquired in the course of our development, gradually growing into those who we are today. <br><br>  The truth is that if you want to achieve more than you already have, you yourself have to become something more than what you already are.  You can rephrase it as follows: if you do not change yourself, you will remain at the bottom of the trough. <br><br><h4>  Do it yourself - guide for dummies: </h4><br>  Let's think about what exactly makes a person attractive.  This is a symbiosis of many factors - brilliant professional skills, the right decisions and actions, solid self-discipline, bright personality, character, impeccable reputation, demeanor, and what you say.  And all this can and should be improved. <br><br>  Self-development is an endless process, during which a person improves himself and attracts new perspectives, happy accidents - all this is due to the fact that your desire to become better reflects not only on yourself, but also affects other people. <br><br>  First you need to learn how to live according to your personal ideals.  This simple, the phrase would seem, is an obvious axiom of being for many, although not all are building their present and future on the foundation of these ideals. <br><br>  I really hope that these few steps will help you become the person who will succeed: <br><br>  1. Make a list of your main priorities.  The most difficult thing in this case is to be absolutely honest with yourself.  In the depths of our consciousness, a list of the good that is considered to be a boon to all has eaten  This list varies depending on the era and fashion.  Today, for example, it is fashionable to have a higher education (although, unfortunately, it does not add education to the majority), it is prestigious to be a businessman (although many would rather feel like working in an office "for an uncle"), etc. And we are so often told that in life it is absolutely necessary to do a number of certain things to achieve success, which we ourselves believed in it.  Be careful of your desires - they can come true. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/949/089/a42/949089a42bc84865b3e3a3148fc94f9f.jpg"><br><br>  2. When compiling a list of priorities do not forget about your loved ones.  Many make this mistake and then pay dearly for it.  If you have a family in the first place, and you are not ready to sacrifice her well-being in order to achieve other goals, then think about how to meet all her needs, how to strengthen the ties between her members and not to lose family values ‚Äã‚Äãthat are dear to your heart in everyday work.  Please do not consider these thoughts trivial.  The overwhelming majority of people are accustomed to perceive their loved ones and relatives as something eternal and unshakable, but this is not true - families are crumbling, once related souls become strangers to each other, but the worst thing is that our loved ones can leave us much earlier imagine.  So be with them while you have this opportunity. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/ff7/f9d/a16/ff7f9da16cc243ee967e61b8c2b60b42.jpg"><br><br>  <i>- So, if I move to the factory, I will never see my relatives again?</i> <i><br></i>  <i>- Yes!</i>  <i>Consider it good luck.</i> <br><br>  3. Since we dared to encroach on the ideal, that is, to strive for it, then it would be nice to determine for ourselves what it is all about.  The ideal for each is different, and therefore you need to describe what, in fact, you should go. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/b4b/f75/536/b4bf75536775489394b2ad62d052c0a6.jpg"><br><br>  Here is a way to define the ideal: ‚ÄúDoing your work at the highest level, regardless of the circumstances and pressure.  Constant work on yourself to achieve the highest level of professionalism in your work, as well as build good relationships with people.  The realization that the movement towards the ideal is an endless process, and readiness for stubborn daily work on yourself for self-development and <a href="https://smartprogress.do/">achievement of goals</a> . ‚Äù <br><br>  4. So, when the basic values ‚Äã‚Äãare determined, the ideal is identified, and the motion vector is set, it remains to organize a plan of action.  Set standards by which you can evaluate your own actions and create decision criteria.  A good plan is a foundation, and understanding how you are going to move towards your goal is priceless.  Properly chosen principles according to which you make decisions will be the key to prosperity.  In every business, especially in a young growing company, every decision can turn into success or collapse for everything that you managed to build. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/c69/d08/55e/c69d0855ed404107a1c1b6c57fb9afe6.jpg"><br><br>  Take for example the good old Terminator - the original T-800 model from the immortal world of James Cameron.  The main priority for him is the death of Sarah Connor, the ideal is to work hard for the benefit of the cyber family (Skynet) and ensure a happy future for the machines without John Connor.  There's nothing to complain about here - the guy is motivated and focused on achieving the goal.  His zeal would be yes to all of us.  The problem of the Terminator lies precisely in the fact that the decision criteria were erroneous, and therefore the actions of the character that glorified Arnie do not lead him to success, although it is difficult to argue that the motion vector is correct.  So do not repeat his mistakes and do not neglect the importance of each decision you make. <br><br>  5. To work on yourself enjoy the benefits of civilization.  In the modern world there are dozens of tools that are designed to help you both in setting goals and in planning time.  Calendar applications (for example, Fantastical 2, Sunrise or Shifts) and task managers (Todoist, Any.Do or cheerful Carrot) will help you in drawing up the daily routine, since modern developers have created many of them.  Or, for example, <br>  <strong><a href="https://smartprogress.do/">SmartProgress</a> goal achievement</strong> service is a good solution for those who need additional motivation and want to share their ideas and achievements with others, as well as ask for advice. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/3d2/925/b02/3d2925b0280942bb8f10050b108b282f.jpg"><br><br>  6. Change, create yourself, learn.  Usually, the causes of changes in a person are two completely different states: inspiration or despair.  And it is better to start from the first, until I had to make horror attempts to catch up, seeing on the horizon, instead of the cherished blue bird of luck, a fried rooster, sung by Russian folklore.  So let your dreams of a better life be a stimulus and source of inspiration for you, which will help you find strength to work on yourself even harder than on your work.  Do not forget that the most important result of your labors is you yourself. <br><br>  You outlined goals and priorities, looked into the eyes of the ideal and outlined the path that you have to go to success.  So bolder hit the road.  As the great Morpheus said: "To know the path and walk it is not the same thing."  This journey will change you, and try to make your values ‚Äã‚Äãconsonant with the goals, and the inner world is in harmony with your lifestyle.  Only then will you be happy and successful. <br><br>  <i>PS If you do not have an account in Habr√©, you can express your opinion on <a href="http://smarttalks.club/ru/attract-success/">this article in our blog - SmartTalks</a></i> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/294802/">https://habr.com/ru/post/294802/</a></p>
