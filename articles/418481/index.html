Judging by the comments to the post, this topic is of interest to many.  I will try to talk about what happened and occasionally come across.  I am not a programmer, I can not tell about the features of employment, interviews, vacancies in these areas, these questions are better for the author of the original post, but you will encounter the features mentioned here anyway, as many of them affect absolutely everyone, even tourists and other guests of the country. <br><br>  <b>Warning!</b>

      In this post will be present criticism of the current state of affairs in Israel.  The purpose of this post is not to criticize Israel or incite any enmity.  Please treat with understanding, because  the moment is really painful for many. <br><br>  Please treat these notes as sketches and side observations.  Even with this approach, there are problems, because  many Israelis either do not notice the problems, or simply desperate to change something.  Dissenters, as a rule, leave the country, because  The press "do not dare to curse Israel" is very strong at all levels, from domestic to corporate and state. <br><br>  Many problems and issues are easy to solve technically, but impossible to reconcile in practice.  The state, ministries, officials, and just the heads of anything are very inert.  This inertness is often explained by everything in succession — by religiosity, “special Middle Eastern” mindset, difficult stories, evil neighbors, and special national motives — there are many reasons for this, but as a rule, if they come up with reasons, it is still there. <br><br><h3>  Language policy </h3><br>  In Israel, there are exactly two state languages ​​- Hebrew and Arabic.  The State of Israel is doing its best to get everyone to learn Hebrew.  This is a sore moment, because the language is really difficult.  Being Semitic, he is not like any other European.  It does not look like Turkic languages, therefore neither Tatar, nor Kazakh, nor Uzbek will help you.  He has his own script with its own peculiarities. <br><br>  The main problem of the language from the point of view of IT is writing.  Yes, it is not Latin.  And also from right to left.  And, as a rule, without vowels.  The combination of these factors creates a mass, a ton of problems, adding to the difficulties in designing local information systems. <br>  If you do not know the alphabet, you will feel “like in China” and will literally tear your hair out.  Unable to read the name of the product in the store.  Signboard  A sign on the bus.  Address on the envelope.  Your name is on the list !!!  It is an “absolutely Chinese” language for anyone who does not own this alphabet.  You can find someone who will speak with you in the same language.  Many people in Israel speak English, Russian, French.  There are Russian curators, officials, Russian channels, Russian news, Russian shops and newspapers. <br><br>  NO unity.  There are no clear standards and unambiguous record.  For example, you do not own Hebrew and you need to know the bus schedule for a particular bus stop.  At the bus stop it will be written, for example, אוסישקין.  What it is?  We photograph, google, translit.  <i><b>Ussishkin</b></i> .  Ussyshkin, good.  We are looking for a site with a bus schedule and at least some English in the interface.  Enter Ussishkin.  "There is no such stop."  Why?  And because someone "translated" this name as <i><b>Ussyshkin</b></i> or even worse, as <b><i>Vsshkin</i></b> .  Make hints or auto-substitution, taking into account the variety of possible options?  What for?  Teach Hebrew!  Sign at the stop in Latin?  What for?  Tourists on city buses will not go!  At such moments, you thank all the gods only for the fact that in Israel they use familiar numbers everywhere instead of writing numbers with Hebrew letters ... <br><br>  Another example is <b>סמלנסקי</b> , <b><i>Smlnski</i></b> .  Is it Smilyansky or Smolensky?  And the one and the other!  Take a bite, you can not guess!  Accordingly, if somewhere something is signed in English so, in another place it can be signed in English quite differently.  This would not be a problem if the input forms allowed such ambiguity and offered clues.  And this is far from everywhere.  So in the address.  And if there is the letter "W", "F" or "J"?  Chernyakhovsky, he is <b><i>Tchernichovskiy</i></b> and he is <b><i>Chernyakhovsky</i></b> !  <b>טשרניחובסקי</b> <br><br>  <i>Heil Ha'Avir</i> or <i>Kheil HaAvir</i> ?  “Write as you please, Israel is small, they will understand it!” They will understand, of course, and this ambiguity is no different from the ambiguity of the “Lenina st.  1-2 ”VS“ ul.Lenina, d.1, kv.2 ”, if only there were no situations when you have to remember or guess which of the possible variants is“ correct ”.  "Correctness" is relative, and each has its own.  Forms for entering a delivery address, a navigator application, a post office, a taxi, a website with a bus schedule - if you don’t know how it is in Hebrew or how it sounds right, you can feel embarrassed. <br><br>  The reverse is also true - you can write a non-Hebrew word or name in Hebrew in different ways.  Require "as in the passport" wherever possible.  Otherwise there will be problems. <br><br>  I’m voicing an unpopular opinion - the modern IT world is not really designed for right-to-left writing.  There is little support for Unicode, fonts are also not the biggest problem, the problem lies in the heads of both developers and users. <br><br>  For example, here is a simple login form on the site.  The cursor carefully jumps to the rightmost border of the input field. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/oc/ez/ml/ocezmlhsu1sur5yeic0evsv5q6e.png"><br><br>  And the password field (the second field) accepts a password in Latin input and numbers.  But at the same time, the form is still designed as Hebrew, with the display of the entered characters from right to left!  And what kind of password to come up with during registration so that it can be entered in the same way in direct order and inverse?  Well, except symmetrical, something like <b>Aaa11aaA</b> . <br><br>  Cursor, jumping here and there, in general, from now on, your companion for a long time.  This is how the right-to-left and left-to-right text mixes in one line. <br><br>  This is the example of Hebrew text: עִבְרִית <br><br>  One click of the arrow and the cursor flies away to another part of the phrase.  The same with the Delete and Backspace buttons, which start to work inversely, acting in reverse at the most inopportune moment.  Is the space before the Hebrew word - is it still “left-to-right”, or is it already “right-to-left”? <br>  Annoying worse than the "drunken camera" in the old games about Lara Croft!  Hands off for such a design!  Usability, interfaces, controls - all this is very lame.  Right-to-left writing breaks the patterns.  You can not just take the usual design or template of some CMS and apply it on the Hebrew-language site.  It’s not even necessary to simply “mirror” it, but to think carefully about all aspects that directly affect the usability of this site or interface.  As a rule, beautifully and universally does not work.  And to make the "European" version of the site fundamentally different from the Hebrew one, usually do not bother. <br><br>  One of the most obvious difficulties is not another language in itself, not a different script, but their mixing in one place with traditional European. <br><br>  In the Arab world, exactly the same problems.  Here you can read what difficulties arise in the development and localization of applications in Arabic and how to overcome them: <br>  <a href="https://habr.com/company/abbyy/blog/251579/">habr.com/company/abbyy/blog/251579</a> <br>  <a href="https://habr.com/company/abbyy/blog/256159/">habr.com/company/abbyy/blog/256159</a> <br><br>  <b>The</b> Hebrew <b>keyboard layout</b> looks like this: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/43b/3f0/b62/43b3f0b6299d32d10dd143766cf36255.png" alt="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/168/d32/279/168d32279c3f170b0d7d111dd09ac677.gif" alt="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/79d/d99/0ba/79dd990ba677b9512d3944412ec53587.jpg" alt="image"><br>  <i>More examples of Hebrew letters on a real keyboard</i> <br><br>  There are English letters (Latin) on the keys.  If anyone needs a Russian keyboard, you can order, buy stickers or even find them in some Russian stores. <br>  “Alphabetical” or “phonetic” principle is practically not observed, the layout is completely different, special, not tied to the Latin alphabet.  Those.  <b>ג is</b> not on the <b>G</b> key, <b>א is</b> not on the <b>A</b> key, etc.  At the same time, they put it on the <b>Z</b> key, and <b>ר</b> on the <b>R</b> key. <br><br>  All “multilingualism” rests on the position of the state “we are different, but we want Hebrew to be spoken in Israel”.  The state does not interfere with your communication in another language.  The state gives you the opportunity to learn Hebrew for free.  The state will not penalize anyone for the Russian language.  Open Russian shop or club, too, there are no obstacles.  But the choice of ordinary people simply do not have.  Without Hebrew, you are not even mute - you are deaf and blind, you cannot read or write, and around you 100% China.  One way or another, you will learn it.  At least the alphabet. <br><br>  In English, you will be spoken not only in museums and tourist places such as the tourist information center, but simply not the fact that you will be spoken in English or Russian at the post office, in the supermarket or at the checkout counter of the urban transport service center, where you can solve the issue with the pass.  The language question may arise even at the box office of the central bus station!  And what about the wonderful situation “I say, but I do not understand”?  The person will tell you that yes, he speaks English.  Listen to you, carefully nodding.  And then it turns out that he doesn’t understand anything of what was said and is waiting for you to repeat everything to him in Hebrew.  Even if it is stated that a particular employee speaks English or another language, this does not mean that his knowledge of the language exceeds the level of “Halloween, Mr.”. <br><br>  Israel is multilingual and multicultural, as long as you stay at a distance from it.  It is easy to hear Russian speech in a supermarket or train.  We went to the Russian store, saw the Russian-speaking pensioners on the bench.  As long as you do not need to go to a regular supermarket, take a regular city bus or buy a travel card, everything will be fine.  Until you came to the post office to send a registered letter, instead of buying a postcard or souvenir.  While you do not need to recalculate the electricity or connect your home phone.  While you buy a SIM-card with the Internet "out of the box" only for 2 weeks and do not think about how to replenish it. <br><br>  In Israel, the method "I do not know the language, but I can at least read the letters."  Turkish, Vietnamese, Malay, at least use your usual writing.  You may not be able to correctly read Tiếng Việt diacritics, but these letters are at least familiar to you.  You can write them down and read them somehow.  Here everything is different. <br><br>  Again, not in the order of holivar, but I cannot but cite as a quote the words spoken in 1935 by <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%2592%25D0%25B5%25D0%25B9%25D1%2586%25D0%25BC%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BD,_%25D0%25A5%25D0%25B0%25D0%25B8%25D0%25BC">Haim Weizman</a> - a scientist, a liberal, a European intellectual and the future first president of Israel: <i>“We did not come to Eretz Israel. life of Warsaw, Pinsk and London.</i>  <i>The essence of Zionism is the change in all values ​​that the Jews learned under the pressure of foreign cultures</i> . <i>”</i>  So it happened. <br><br><h3>  Internet in Israel </h3><br>  Great pain question for any IT person.  And for a simple "modern man."  The topic, which they don’t like to discuss constructively - “Why, because we have such a beautiful advanced IT-country!  Everything is perfect with the Internet! ”Or, on the contrary, the Internet is like a usual eternal topic for grumbling“ how bad we are ”.  What is fuss? <br><br>  In Israel, a distinction has been made between the “areas of responsibility” for the data link provider (infrastructure operator, “tashtit”) and data transfer provider (Internet access itself, “sapak”).  Most often, payment is made by two accounts, two sums to two different companies.  Well, or in the case of autopayment, each company independently bills itself and withdraws money for its services. <br><br>  Infrastructure providers are few.  The main two are <b>Bezeq</b> (“Bezek”) as the largest telephone company and <b>HOT</b> (“Hot”) as the main cable television operator. <br><br>  <b>Bezeq,</b> among other things, manages the telephone stations of conventional telephony and has substations, crosses, wells and other wiring elements on the balance sheet.  This is a large, unhurried and awkward elephant, which has very little to what it is.  Former state telecom, now privatized.  You can imagine how “Rostelecom + MGTS”, such a “two in one” with all the worst that they have from each.  Since this is a telephone company, the main type of “line” they can provide for you is telephone copper “noodles” and the ability to connect to the xDSL Internet.  They have their own “pocket” Internet provider - <a href="https://www.bezeqint.net/russian/internet">Bezeq Benleumi (“Bezek Beinleumi”)</a> .  Even with the choice of "their" provider, the Internet payment is made separately, on a separate account.  You can choose any Internet provider that can capitalize on this infrastructure.  If they want to cross the line or something else, it will be their trouble.  You only need to change the login and password in the modem. <br><br>  The type of connection possible depends very much on the location.  The condition of cable lines, as well as PBX (and the place where they have station equipment) is very different.  Somewhere a rural messy “noodles”, a bunch of twists and capacitors on the way to the station, as a result, ADSL cannot consistently reconcile 2 Mbit / s, and somewhere a “new” line, DSLAM almost in the same house, and VDSL2 speed under 100 Mbps. <br><br>  But in general, on the Bezek <b>very</b> rarely happens <b>very quickly</b> .  Wires are sometimes torn, telephone wells can be flooded (all of a sudden, yes, but sometimes), cars sometimes bump into telephone closets on the streets.  Sometimes the army tears and cuts the army, for example, during the liquidation of digging and tunnels.  Arabs are also a common cause of damage to lines in certain areas.  Damage eliminated long enough. <br><br>  <b>HOT</b> is primarily a cable television operator (conventional analog as well as DVB-C digital cable TV).  Accordingly, it is in charge of coaxial antenna wires (in the CIS, this would be a “collective antenna”, respectively, HOT is such an analogue of the provider Acad / VOL).  And provides the ability to connect to the Internet via coaxial cable (DOCSIS protocol).  As a rule, faster.  If the equipment pulls DOCSIS 3.0, speeds of up to 300 Mbps are possible.  If the line is "seam", then DOCSIS is no more reliable and not stable ADSL. <br><br>  Just HOT had the option of paying one bill to 1 company and for the Internet, and for the line, and for the modem (if you did not buy your own). <br><br>  Everything else is quite rare.  Optics FTTx, GPON, Ethernet to a flat or stationary LTE modems / routers are rare.  Now there are new infrastructure providers that promise optics to the subscriber.  The coverage area is still quite small.  If a good Internet is crucial - you should look at these companies, at least you can always connect HOT or Bezeq, and this is a choice and reserve.  Optics are now offered by Unlimited <a href="https://www.unlimited.net.il/default.aspx%3Flanguage%3Dru-RU">(Russian site)</a> and <a href="https://www.partner.co.il/PartnerPage/partner-fiber/fiberweb">Partner Fiber</a> . <br><br>  <b>Modems and routers are</b> offered as a provider, and the usual, which can be bought in the store.  Providers can both be bought into the property and rented.  Renting a modem is another way to shake some money out of the subscriber.  And if he bought the modem more than a year ago, you can write off any failure that the modem is old and broken, i.e.  so say, buy another one, and with it, everything will work exactly as the clock. <br><br>  There are a variety of modems and routers, like OEM, under the brand name of the provider (in fact, the simplest Chinese, like ZTE and Huawei, and sometimes D-Link, better - usually Netgear), and "regular", which can be bought in the store. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/6m/1y/fj/6m1yfjpblcaezfjd-9ekf33p1s4.jpeg"><br>  <i>In the photo "provider" VDSL-router D-Link DSL-7850U ​​from the company "Bezek"</i> <br><br>  DOCSIS equipment is mainly of Netgear, TP-Link brands, both conventional and branded - under the “HOT Box” brand, these are still found on the Sagem base, and where only DOCSIS 2 comes across, every kind of elderly “Americans” - Arris, Scientific Atlanta, were previously and "Motorola" type of all known SB5100. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/gx/qc/5c/gxqc5cogg9nhdqx7zrubg3y3_24.jpeg"><br>  <i>Web-interface HOT Box'a based on the modification Sagemcom F @ ST 3284</i> <br><br>  The “Internet does not work” repair algorithm is the same everywhere - you call by phone to make a request.  10 times you make your way through the first line, reboot the modem 10-20 times, make a request to leave the technician, which is then forgotten.  Remind you.  Pull to Shabbat.  Shabbat.  Forgot again.  Compensation (“pizza”) is generally due for non-arrival of a technician or his late arrival, but it is also quite difficult and long to knock it out.  Everything is complicated by the language.  A lawyer will help, and with the language, and with the bureaucracy, but this is money.  Big money. <br><br>  Internet providers (“sapak”) are much more.  From large and well-known, such as <a href="https://netvision.cellcom.co.il/">NetVision</a> , or the same cellular operators - Cellcom, Partner in the first place, to incomprehensible offices with a digital name such as <a href="http://011.org.il/">011</a> , <a href="http://www.012.net/">012</a> , <a href="http://018.co.il/">018</a> , and the like. <br><br>  To change the Internet provider, sometimes you need to change the username and password in the modem, and sometimes nothing is needed.  They are calling you on the phone, asking about a profitable Internet, you are not clearly voiced your refusal or your grandmother dictated the elderly card number without understanding - bang - and the application is ready to switch to another provider on the same line.  Since you have not disconnected from the previous provider, the money from the account will be taken both. <br><br>  Another opportunity for requisitions is to provide additional services.  For example, Internet providers may offer antivirus subscription or some content filtering (Parental Control).  Often, such services are imposed, such as 3 months for free, then you need to turn off yourself.  By phone.  In Hebrew.  Did not see / did not read / could not - pay. <br><br>  One of the travel rates on the Internet for review: Bezek line + Bezek Beinleumi provider: VDSL, speed up to 40 Mbit / s, 140 sk / month, plus another 45 shekels per month per line (infrastructure).  In total, there are nearly 200 shekels, which is about <b>$ 54</b> . <br><br>  <b>There is no censorship on the Internet</b> .  There is no IsraComNadzor, no “black lists”, or “great firewalls”.  All sites are open to the public, including Arab ones.  It happens that individual Palestinian sites are unavailable, but there are no state intrigues in this, rather the provider’s curved routes. <br><br><h3>  Banks and payment systems </h3><br>  There are few banks in the country, about a dozen.  The largest, perhaps, 4: <a href="https://www.bankhapoalim.co.il/russian/">“Hapoalim” (hapoalim)</a> , <a href="https://www.leumi.co.il/">“Leumi” (Leumi)</a> , <a href="https://www.discountbank.co.il/DB/ru">“Discount” (Discount)</a> and <a href="https://www.mizrahi-tefahot.co.il/en/Bank/pages/default.aspx">“Mitsrahi-Tefhot” (Mizrahi-Tefahot)</a> .  There is also a <a href="https://bankhadoar.co.il/">postal bank of Israel - Bank haDoar</a> , a local equivalent of the Post Bank.  The only bank that opens the Israeli bank card to a non-resident without question.  About this below. <br><br>  IBAN in the European sense is not used in the country.  Israel does not use IBAN and SEPA even for payments in the EU.  Separate banks use the IBAN-like principle for transfers between banks within Israel, in order not to indicate full details.  In Israel, it is called העברת זה"ב <br><br>  And so, the full set of requisites for transfer within the country looks customary and sad.  Name, surname, name of the bank, bank code, subdivision code, account number. <br><br>  <b>PayPal</b> in Israel is full.  There is an interface in English.  You can receive money and withdraw it to an Israeli bank account by requisites, as well as to a US bank account and some cards. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/-t/q6/qk/-tq6qkbrkvdiemcpibt2w8rapvc.png"><br>  <i>PayPal Bank Account Interface</i> <br><br>  All <b>SWIFT transfers from abroad are</b> controlled, not even taxable, but by the bank, more precisely, its financial monitoring.  For transferring even your own money from your own account from Russia or another country you can get, usually call the bank, the manager, ask to collect documents from where you have the money.  Excuses such as "sold the car in Russia" do not roll, often want to transfer documents (Yeah, a receipt from the buyer or the contract of sale).  The “earned” option works well with some papers such as contracts from Upwork.  Scare taxes and fines. <br><br>  There are no “local” payment systems, or they are not very popular.  "Throw me money on the card" is rare.<font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">In special cases, the type of car purchase prefers a check (!!!), a receipt or payment directly at the bank (as a deposit into an account or a payment order from your account to the seller). </font></font><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/8g/wr/lp/8gwrlpg-hwidn9rxz7gzefyo49k.jpeg"><br> <i><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The check of the bank "Leumi"</font></font></i> <br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> "Remote" banks, "virtual" banks did not exist before. Now there is at least 1 - </font></font><a href="https://pepper.co.il/en/"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">the Pepper project</font></font></a><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> on the Leumi platform. A kind of "Rocket" on the basis of "Discovery". There is already visible progress in the mobile application. There is an option “transfer to another bank client by phone number”, “other client” can be not only a Pepper client, but also a regular Leumi client. The service itself is still carried out by Leumi. </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Interest on deposits is very low. 0.01% is not bad. </font></font><br><br> <b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Internet banking</font></font></b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">in most cases only in Hebrew. Everyone has. There are Russian-speaking and English-speaking managers in the bank branches, if you have a premium service or corporate account, you can secure a Russian-speaking manager, but this does not solve all the problems.

The list of banks contains links to Russian and English versions of sites where they are. You can visually assess how much less information there is compared to the Hebrew version.

Not in Hebrew, you can only withdraw cash with a foreign card. </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Service in banks is almost always paid - there is a fee for maintaining an account. Free service by the condition (turnover, account balance or volume of transfers) is practically not encountered. </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The following dialogue is not uncommon: </font></font><br> <b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Banker (B):</font></font></b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> Thank you for choosing our bank.

In response, they are almost always offered a discount or a more advantageous tariff plan. Far from all reach the actual transition. And this is a difficult, painful process, especially if you do not like to talk on the phone, sort things out, prove something or convince. Even if you have seen an advertisement and brought a leaflet, you may be told that this tariff is no longer there, or that it is only for new customers, or vice versa, only for well-deserved old customers, etc. Constantly have to push, demand, insist.</font></font><br><br><h3>  Bank cards </h3><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Israel has its own national processing center for bank cards, and not even one. If not mistaken, there are three: IsraCard, LeumiCard, CAL. They are managed jointly by the bank and the state, and this makes it possible to conduct operations within Israel on cards and accounts of different banks without recourse to the international payment system (Visa or MasterCard). Approximately how Russia can now make payments on MasterCard cards in Crimea without pulling MasterCard itself with the help of NSPK. At the same time, Israel does not need to issue its cards (as “MIR”, “Pro100”, “BelCard”); outside Israel, operations will go through Visa / MasterCard. </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">You can only open a card to a non-resident without an Israeli identity card or without documents entitling you to permanent residence in one bank - </font></font><a href="http://www.israelpost.co.il/content.nsf/misparide/smartcard_"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">in the Israeli postal bank</font></font></a><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">(ask about the card in the mail). It will take 3 documents: a passport, visa or entry card (issued at the border) and any other document with a photo from the client's country of citizenship. Usually they want a driver's license, but there are other options. You will also be asked to give the address in Israel. The result will be the receipt of a MasterCard debit bank card in dollars, shekels or euros, which can be paid where only an Israeli bank card is required. </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Also, this card has an Israeli account number, and in principle it is possible to deposit money by bank transfer, but with some restrictions, which, unfortunately, I don’t know the details.</font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Internet banking without an Israeli ID card will not be able to connect you. You can extract a statement and replenish a cash card by mail. You can pay by card on the Internet and in retail outlets, as well as withdraw money from ATMs (with a commission). The card is valid for 3 years or 5 years (depending on the batch of cards). The card is not specific, is issued by mail immediately after registration. The cost of the card is 45 shekels (approximately $ 12.5). </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The tax code and address in the country of citizenship is not asked, I believe that according to </font></font><a href="http://gidprava.ru/mnp/2017/12/24/automatic-exchange/"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">OECD / CRS</font></font></a><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> , nothing is reported to the tax country of citizenship. Ordinary banks, by the way, reported. Therefore, a repatriate is a hypothetical chance to face a request from the Russian tax for opening an account abroad.</font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Most credit cards, even "debit" cards have some features of credit - a limit on access to their own funds in the account, the ability to spend money in installments (on a "debit" card), overdraft. </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Even if you pay in the supermarket with an “ordinary” bank card, wild combinations of the type “100 can be debited from the account now, 100 are not credited with the bank's money and 100 are not taken now, but arranged in installments by the store for 3 months”.</font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">How much and how you write off your account is quite difficult to control. Many operators (communications, bank account management, insurance, taxes, utility bills) are able to independently debit money from your bank account as they please. This mechanism of autopaying is called “oraat kev”, and it used to require a client’s signature for it, but now it has been abolished, and it is enough to name these cards correctly so that a recurrent payment is “hung” on it.</font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The “American” moment, it is not particularly customary to monitor the balance in real time. Posting on the account may take some time. Installment, overdraft and credit limit are taken into account separately, and are not always visible as a movement of funds in the main account. Online alerts such as Push or SMS are not all. It is generally accepted once a month to carefully examine the statement sent by the bank, and just about what to call to call if something does not converge. </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">All cards are </font></font><b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">magnetic stripe</font></font></b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> . Even if the terminal can read the </font></font><b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">chip</font></font></b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">it will still use a magnetic stripe. On the chip with a high probability will come from the processing side. PayPass, Google Pay, Apple Pay are not supported almost anywhere. Only Samsung Pay works on devices with magnetic strip emulation. </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">A remarque - many Israeli cards have a chip. The bank will say "this is for payment in the EU." Why not use the chip in Israel?</font></font><br><br><h3>  post office </h3><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Mail in Israel is very popular because it, among other things, pays utility bills, pays taxes, checks out a car for a database, receives and sends money transfers, and works with Post Bank bank cards. </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">In post offices there are electronic queue terminals where you can choose the service you need and the desired language of communication. The language of the terminal messages and the language of the inscription on the number depend on your choice of language, but not the language abilities of the cashier who will serve you. You can select “Russian” or “English” all the way, but the cashier can easily be “not a boom boom” in any language other than Hebrew and Arabic.</font></font><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/wj/jw/ks/wjjwksv0o7icebkjlf33cbq1mqa.png"><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">A registered letter abroad costs from 15 shekels (not tracked in the USA, Canada and Australia, a track number like RR ... IL, reaches most countries of the CIS, EU and USA in 15 days) up to 30 shekels (custom "1st class", full tracking, in the US and the EU goes for 7-10 days, the type number is LX ... IL). </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Parcels from abroad are taxed. </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">In no case do not send a parcel with goods to Israel by express mail EMS - EMS always fall under customs payments, they are not subject to duty-free limits. The base duty-free limit is $ 75. For some categories of goods (cosmetics, tobacco, alcohol, drugs) the limit does not apply even in the case of regular mail. </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Mail delivery within Israel (by country) is fast.

Even in some kibbutz.  Public transport IS, it is modern, clean, comfortable, and even quite a regular, if you understand it.  The logic is there, but not always obvious. <br><br>  Example: Until mid-2017, there was NO ONE direct route between the country's largest airport (Ben-Gurion, TLV) and the capital (Jerusalem).  Or take a taxi, or make a transfer at the airport exit (El Al Junction), or at the Tel Aviv bus station.  In 2017, the route of the bus number 485 "Airport-Jerusalem" company Afikim still launched, and it was ... forced. <br>  The route network is large and divided between several transport companies.  There is no single route scheme for the country.  There is no CONVENIENT navigator, which is guaranteed to show how to get to and from, if the path is connected with transfers to buses of different companies.  Some information is in Google Maps, but you should check the routes and changes, because  updates are rare there. <br><br>  An example of the page <a href="http://www.danbadarom.co.il/lines/lineDetails.aspx%3FlineNumber%3D62%26lc%3D26062">of the Dan bus company</a> with the official timetable: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/pw/o1/5r/pwo15rkdbyj2irqe5mnssgtsfwa.png"><br><br>  The most convenient and thoughtful navigation on the <a href="https://mslworld.egged.co.il/%3Flanguage%3Den">site of the largest bus company, Egged</a> : <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/yw/le/if/ywleifh3ao7tz_qaxj3z1ohp9pm.png"><br><br>  The site itself is also available in Russian and English, but the navigator is only in English and Hebrew.  Egged's English-language navigator is the most adequate of all those currently represented in Israel.  Shows transplants, docking, the location of the stop on the map and even buses on the route.  Searches only on Egged routes, i.e.  you also need to know which companies serve the city you need and which company owns the route you need. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/sv/bc/tc/svbctcamxdm-_3qdism9wkabaug.png"><br><br>  More or less adequate and up-to-date information on all routes of all companies is on the third-party “unified” website <a href="https://www.bus.co.il/">www.bus.co.il</a> <br><br>  It is usable through the browser, there are prompts in Latin in the input fields, the output of information is quite convenient.  But his mobile app is terrible. <br><br>  Flaws of translation or lack of translit are also found on this site: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/pb/1b/qi/pb1bqifogsqwsbpj0vxuwi4tmxa.png"><br><br>  <b>Electric cars are</b> not very popular, are rare.  Charging is not visible even in the business center of large cities.  Tesla has not seen once.  It is possible that residents of kibbutz and small towns are holes and set their own charges in their homes, using something small like a Nissan LEAF or Chevrolet VOLT to travel to the city "sometimes for business", but this is rare.  Hybrids come across mainly Prius.  There are projects of pure electric taxi in Haifa and Tel Aviv. <br><br>  <b>Motorcycles are</b> quite rare.  Even the smallest 50cc scooter stool requires a driver's license, registration, numbers and insurance.  Getting the rights to a motorcycle is quite difficult and expensive.  There are no moped-holes like “Alpha” or “Delta” at all.  Scooters and maxi-scooters are quite common, but they are not in the majority, do not prevail on the road, there is absolutely no such feeling of “moto-madness” as can be found on the roads of Thailand, Vietnam and Cambodia.  Scooters are mostly Korean (SYM) and Chinese, the “Japanese” are a little less common, and there is no exotic like Aprilia at all. <br><br>  <b>Electric bikes</b> and electric scooters, on the contrary, are very common, although the finished factory-made products cost a lot of money there.  Often this is the only self-propelled vehicle that can be bought “right now” without a loan and a bank. <br><br>  In cities, <b>car sharing</b> appears, while this phenomenon is only gaining momentum.  There are few machines yet, the registration interface is convenient, but it is not known whether it accepts documents from non-residents.  For payment wants a credit card of Israel.  Here is <a href="https://olehadash.com/carsharing-in-haifa/">information on the experience of using carsharing in Haifa</a> . <br><br>  Traditional car rentals are popular among non-residents. <br><br>  <b>Tel-O-Fun bike rental is available in Tel</b> Aviv.  Terminals support the Russian language.  Here is <a href="https://avderin.livejournal.com/96619.html">information on bike rental</a> . <br><br>  <b>The railway network</b> is one of the most understandable, stable and convenient ways to move around the country.  <a href="https://www.rail.co.il/en">The site of the railways of Israel</a> , the trains themselves and the stations have the most “European” design and the greatest possible usability for Israel. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/ui/zy/4r/uizy4rp-eruwu0ezgikctcjdxdy.png"><br>  <a href="https://www.rail.co.il/en/pages/stationsnlines.aspx">Website page with network layout</a> <br><br>  There are clear English-language schemes and timetables, it is easy to buy a ticket - there is English in the vending machines, and the interface is usable at the same time, at large stations or a senior cashier, or the station head will still speak English.  Rolling stock new, European type, Siemens and Bombardier.  There are both wagons under diesel and diesel trains. <br><br>  Work is underway on the electrification of the network, along with the construction of a high-speed highway to Jerusalem (project A1). <br><br>  Among the shortcomings of the railway, we can distinguish its limited coverage (in some places there are simply no trains), possible delays, they still happen from time to time, inspection at the entrance to each station and turnstiles at the exit (the fare depends on the distance).  There is still no convenient train to Jerusalem - since the A1 highway to the center is not ready yet, the only way to get to Jerusalem by train is to transfer at Beit Shemesh station and diesel train to Malha station on the outskirts of Jerusalem.  The line is single track, passes through the reserve, the places are beautiful, but it is a long and uncomfortable ride. <br><br>  There is a single electronic contactless travel card - <b>“Rav-Kav”</b> , all bus companies and railways are connected to the system, the card is the carrier for recording travel cards (now another “transport reform” is taking place - new travel options are introduced, among which there are interesting options “The whole country”, “South”, “North” - such a travel card can be beneficial if there are many trips around the country from end to end), as well as a universal “electronic wallet”, where from a single balance you can pay for travel in cars  Bus any company of any official route. <br><br><img src="http://k6s3v6r4.ssl.hwcdn.net/pictures/785/785765.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Do not accept the map "Rav-Kav" only taxis, minibuses and Arab buses.  The map was introduced with a lot of creak and a lot of conflicts between the Ministry of Transport, system developers and bus companies.  It was really hard to agree on a single balance. <br>  Understanding the system is quite difficult, even in the “simplest” mode of an electronic wallet, difficulties may arise when there is a “contract conflict” when you refill a card or record a travel card - if there is a card for example, a weekly ticket for the city , separately 2 trips and another 100 shekels of money in the wallet.  Each company has its own priorities, what to write off first. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/kc/rk/ap/kcrkapjvntauhy9ea8nvie0jmyg.jpeg"><br>  On the photo the error message "Conflict of contracts."  The machine does not know what to charge and what to charge. <br><br>  The interface of the ticket machine is different for all companies.  At Egged it is the most logical and understandable.  The railways are perfectly acceptable.  But the company Dan ...

Combine contracts and transfer money can only be in the service center of urban transport, where there may be problems with the language.  There is also a mobile application, but to use it you need a phone with a compatible NFC chip, or a USB reader and browser plugin.  And here is also one language, Hebrew. <br><br>  About ticket reform and new travel can be <a href="http://www.trans-reform.org.il/rus/qna.html">found here.</a> <br><br>  And the most interesting discussion about how it works "from the inside" <a href="https://forum.awd.ru/viewtopic.php%3Ff%3D359%26t%3D262432%26start%3D320">here</a> . <br><br><h3>  cellular </h3><br>  In Israel, there are 3 large "traditional" mobile operators: <br><br><ul><li>  Partner (formerly Orange), </li><li>  Cellcom, </li><li>  Pelephone. </li></ul><br>  Virtual operators are working on their networks - the most famous of them are HOT Talk and 019. Now there are new ones, such as 012. <br><br>  Internet speed is generally very good.  The coverage is growing, 4G LTE or very fast 3G is available almost all over the country. <br><br>  SIM prepaid cards are sold freely and without a passport.  And this is in a country where the terrorist threat is not an empty sound.  You can buy a SIM card at a kiosk or salon.  No registration, verification or registration.  The SIM with Israeli number starts working immediately after the purchase. <br><br>  It is unpleasant that even an empty new SIM card itself without an Internet package and without money on the balance sheet is worth a substantial amount (from 20 shekels, around $ 5). <br><br>  All operators have service notices, balance inquiries, traffic balance and self-service sites (such as "personal account") only in Hebrew.  In some places there is a choice of notification language or voice menu language, but far from everything has been translated.  Hebrew gets out everywhere.  In the support service, there is almost always a Russian-speaking specialist, but you still need to get to him through an incomprehensible voice menu (pushing “0” to get to the operator works far from everywhere). <br><br>  The operation “change the tariff” or “connect the Internet package” on the SIM card without knowledge of the language is 99.9% impossible.  There are no simple and clear commands, nor a convenient application with large buttons without squiggles. <br><br>  There is no 100% unlimited mobile internet. <br><br>  100 GB per month costs an average of 140-160 shekels ($ 40-45) on Cellcom and Pelephone. <br>  Partner offers 75 GB at full speed for 200 shekels per month ($ 55), after the exhaustion of 75 GB cuts speed. <br><br>  Almost everywhere unlimited calls to Israel are included in the package price.  These are basic rates that are available to everyone without a contract. <br><br>  There are more lucrative offers, but they need to be knocked out, literally ripped from the operators.  And, of course, it will be a contract with the operator’s access to a bank account.  For example, a current two-year contract with Partner gives you the opportunity to receive 100 GB and unlimited voice communication in just 70 shekels per month. <br><br>  Virtual operators in general are more interesting and more profitable now, especially if such large volumes of traffic are not needed. <br><br>  Many contracts have a period before which it is impossible to terminate the contract or to go to another operator in order to avoid penalties.  Now there are options for 2 years and 5 years. <br><br>  And how do you find such a cunning method of weaning money from the people? <br><br>  Went to another operator - return the SIM-card (idle, blocked)!  Did not return / throw out / office at the other end of the country?  Pay a fine of 99 shekels, because  SIM card - the property of the operator!  So Cellcom is having fun. <br><br>  If you have just arrived in Israel as a tourist or a guest, then right at the airport you will see the “company store” 019, where they sell SIM cards.  All anything, but sell them there at very different prices - 10 GB for $ 30, 30 GB for $ 50, 100 GB for $ 60: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/ta/rm/nv/tarmnvqhoitj9an1rgj01ijq0sa.png"><br><br>  They even have an <a href="https://019mobile.com/">“official website” in English</a> , quite of a “European” type.  And in the replenishment of the account you will be carefully helped.  With the commission. <br><br>  Business u guys, you see.  But everything is so sad, because there is no other way out.  There is no working way to even simply replenish the balance on the Israeli prepaid SIM card, not understanding Hebrew and not having an Israeli bank card.  There are not even intermediary sites like <a href="https://www.ding.com/ru">Ding</a> or <a href="https://www.recharge.com/en">Recharge.com</a> <br><br>  If you google, then there are options for replenishment.  Manually, with full prepayment.  For example, here a <a href="https://www.pcworks.co.il/product-category/recharge/">small Internet cafe in Tel Aviv is ready to help</a> : <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/vy/tq/an/vytqana5gugxnxorqxtv4obtopq.png"><br><br><h3>  As a summary </h3><br>  The seeming clarity and simplicity of the country is deceptive.  Without knowledge of a difficult local language, not similar to European, some everyday moments are tangible complexity. <br>  Much in the country can get better.  Much can be simplified, standardized, improved - but for this you need to step over the resistance, through the "always dissatisfied" and through "all contented", and first take one step, then the other. <br><br>  Many minds and developments of Israel do not serve Israel, but other countries.  These developments, technologies and minds have a place in their own country.  To love the Motherland is not only to chant it, to admire it, to protect it in the ranks, but also to take small simple steps towards its bright future. <br><br>  <b>UPD 1.</b> Added a little more <b>about banks.</b> <br>  <b>UPD 2.</b> Added pro <b>keyboard layout.</b> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/418481/">https://habr.com/ru/post/418481/</a></p>
