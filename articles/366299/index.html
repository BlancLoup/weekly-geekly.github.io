Unusual review quadcopter Cheerson CX-20</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  About Cheerson CX-20 has already been written a lot of reviews, so I will not be repeated and tell you about its "combat" use. <br><br>  I am one of those who prefer active rest, and this year I had two campaigns planned: Svaneti (Georgia) and Kachkar climbing (Turkey).  In the amount of 25 days of rest.  In such events with me, GoPro is always with me, but at some point I wanted to add even more unusual angles and I purchased a quadrocopter and four spare batteries for it. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/593/f99/461/593f994610c64eaabca9e61cd2922eaa.JPG"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h3>  Training </h3><br>  After the story of the <a href="http://geektimes.ru/company/dronk/blog/259236/">importation of a quadrocopter to Ukraine</a> , I decided not to tempt fate and packed it in a backpack so as not to shine it once again.  He wrapped it in a sleeping bag in such a way that the pressure was distributed over the entire surface, thereby minimizing the chance of damage during transportation.

He was all right. <br><br><h3>  Svaneti (Georgia) </h3><br>  <b>Day 1</b> , the evening before dinner.  The wind was not strong and I decided to make the first test flight, took out a quadrocopter and found a crack on the protruding antenna (there is an electronic compass in it).  The compass itself was not damaged and I successfully made some photos of our camp, after which the wind rose and I had to stop the flight. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/add/b6e/41c/addb6e41cca94566b4cda40865fe745e.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/037/c2b/b36/037c2bb36af941c1990ca36a5c9991d0.JPG"><br><br>  <b>Day 2</b> , the hidden function of grazing cows.  For the night we settled on a large glade on the slope.  The place turned out to be ideal for flying, but even today I was upset, on the quadcopter the single ‚Äúwing‚Äù snapped.  Most likely this happened because I didn‚Äôt fill the voids around Cheerson badly. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/1a9/396/b05/1a9396b050a949c69cdedb654e4536af.jpg"><br><br>  The injury was not fatal and I managed to fly successfully.  First of all, I checked the flight data without a camera.  The drone behaved obediently, I even managed to chase the cows (they obviously were not thrilled by the flying friend). <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/b28/54a/4f7/b2854a4f77bd4f288e719e8f54020eec.JPG"><br><br>  The first flight with the camera ended in a fall, as with an additional load, the reaction to the gas stick was slowed down. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/oXxaoNjcsro%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,1500004,15700021,15700186,15700190,15700248,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhirnachzwj1xRstyVApS6xQ9PsF5g" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/462/ac8/445/462ac84459924b26bd28fa90c5cc814f.JPG"><br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/1sQ3xL8aQhQ%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,1500004,15700021,15700186,15700190,15700248,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhg9fh_m3jQkj5FL1JzmF2moi61xmg" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  For the next days I wore a quadrocopter on top of the backpack to avoid further damage. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/4d2/5cb/117/4d25cb1179984ffc8a96d034594f88b1.jpg"><br><br>  <b>Day 5</b> , Lake Koruldi and Mestia lookout.  In the radial access to the lake, I took a quadrocopter with me, I had a great idea for a video.  But unfortunately, the video was too dark.  Most likely this is due to the sun shining in the lens, although it was overcast. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/zx0V8ycNR_w%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,1500004,15700021,15700186,15700190,15700248,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhjYWJV89cWP2OT9KnZYZqASZUKQhw" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/a70/760/7d9/a707607d960545e39f92ab374f91a6b7.jpg"><br><br>  I made another attempt to fly on the observation deck over Mestia.  This flight also failed due to strong wind, but I still got a couple of good shots. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/901/0fa/a19/9010faa194a047f9a62d53258ef58b82.jpg"><br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/sw6UpzZMa78%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,1500004,15700021,15700186,15700190,15700248,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhgFV0UMm3l2c1NZohKz5F6LL_jMcQ" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  <b>Day 6</b> , launch from the Svan tower.  Before lunch, we looked at Mestia, climbed onto the roof of one of the towers.  In search of interesting shots, I launched a quadrocopter from the roof, it was difficult to fly, as the gusts of wind constantly blew it.  He had to catch him back because the roof was small and sloping. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/jdkvMo_nXss%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,1500004,15700021,15700186,15700190,15700248,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhgLvxHIIxsMpnN1bVcGM82SEHzXng" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  <b>Day 8</b> , long-time pass and broken compass.  With the first rays of the sun, we began to wade through thickets of grass and rhododendrons to the pass.  On the other side of the pass, the slope was much steeper.  From the vegetation there was only grass, which had to be held in hands.  Already at the very bottom I stumbled and swayed forward, thereby holding the quadcopter between the backpack and the head, at that moment the remote antenna broke, the day before I had already pasted it. <br><br>  <b>Day 9</b> , a mountain lake on the Svan ridge.  The lake is quite high and is surrounded on three sides by mountains, and only on one side there is a view of the mountains.  This relief was a second chance, after the lakes of Koruldi, for my idea.  This time I miscalculated, I took off too low. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/BRapEemvAts%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,1500004,15700021,15700186,15700190,15700248,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhjxMdJhwzp8Sms-hAp0J3yam90Plw" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/3da/08f/9ae/3da08f9ae9fc44ecb452839fa6ae5ef7.jpg"><br><br>  <b>Day 10</b> , pampering on the water.  The morning began with flights, right away I just flew over the clearing, but then I decided to hang over the lake.  It seemed that everything was going well, but at some point I was distracted and the quadrocopter fell into the water.  After a preliminary inspection, he was not injured. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/9a8/5ef/1fd/9a85ef1fde6040c0bc7e4c213806259a.JPG"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/593/f99/461/593f994610c64eaabca9e61cd2922eaa.JPG"><br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/aCyeW47xUr0%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,1500004,15700021,15700186,15700190,15700248,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhg-AZrHTZ5f_Jabb77qanrb6GUb9A" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br><h3>  Moving from Georgia to Turkey </h3><br>  From Batumi to Pazar, we went by shuttle bus, so I didn‚Äôt hide the quadrocopter in my backpack, but just put it in a bag and covered it with a jacket so that it wouldn‚Äôt catch on.  At the border, when my things were shining, the quadrocopter looked like several boards in the scanner's monitor and in some places the wiring was viewed.  In general, nothing suspicious and in the future I stopped being afraid that there could be problems due to it.  The main thing is not to show it openly. <br><br><h3>  Kachkar (Turkey) </h3><br>  <b>Day 2</b> , flight after a thunderstorm.  The transition was a squall wind and rain, but in the evening the clouds parted and I gathered a quadrocopter.  Some time after takeoff, he began to squeak, informing about the low battery charge, and I panicked.  As a result, I was entangled in the management and so that the irreparable could not stop the motors at a height of about 5 meters.  As a result, he broke both legs (chassis), but it is good that there is always a band-aid in the tourist's first-aid kit.  After treatment, the legs became even better, they gained elasticity. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/ebe/b32/750/ebeb32750d1b40a2b485d82545919db4.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/83f/d23/e26/83fd23e269524966829a8858391356cc.jpg"><br><br>  <b>Day 3</b> , a huge glade rugged streams.  In the middle of the day we reached a huge clearing where cows grazed and the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãfilming it from above did not leave me.  Having overcome the clearing along, I still decided to fly over it despite the wind. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/c26/802/4d9/c268024d9bba49a5a9ab1d248f3f552c.jpg"><br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/Zk1kKcDMSJI%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,1500004,15700021,15700186,15700190,15700248,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhgQ5QH2RGDuH30p5AUTCt6abOBd0w" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  <b>Day 6</b> , grazing cows.  Did you know that cows and dogs are about the same as Tom and Jerry?  All anything, but the battlefield was in our tents and we did what we drove away the cows.  Relying on the experience with Svanetia, I launched a quadrocopter, they managed to drive off cows by 500 meters. That was enough for 20 minutes, after which they rapidly, with the whole herd, ran to the dogs barking, which for some reason hung around our tents constantly.  By the way, on this flight I let the quadcopter go far and decided to use the ‚Äúreturn home‚Äù function.  Cheerson behaved quite strangely, he then flew in my direction, then flew away to the side and back.  Most likely this was due to the wind, as the slope of the turn in the return mode is small.  After waiting for the quadcopter to fly closer, I switched to manual mode, then lowered the height and returned it to me without any problems. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/KhBitrew-bw%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,1500004,15700021,15700186,15700190,15700248,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhhzRevI-lnRhR0vGsAOiJr_MEmzQw" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/GRLSA4Qo0zs%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,1500004,15700021,15700186,15700190,15700248,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhi3j0hlnh94CrLDrOh1jR-ar5kBAw" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br><h3>  Conclusion </h3><br>  Perhaps, I'll start with the minuses, there are actually only two of them.  First, I want to note the poor location of the antenna with a compass.  At each stroke, the cap broke off from the leg, in the end I just threw it on top so that it was as close as possible to the body.  Secondly, these are legs, they with more or less serious more beautiful broke.  I think they should be made of a more flexible plastic. <br>  In addition, it is better to do the shooting with the gimbal, because it is difficult for me to find a segment of more than five seconds without jerking. Http: //dronk.ru/shorten/zy <br><br>  Despite these minor drawbacks, I am ready to recommend <a href="https://dronk.ru/shorten/d">this quadrocopter</a> .  He fell, sank, blown away by the wind and at the same time he is in working condition and still with me. <br><br>  Separately, I want to note the mode ‚ÄúReturn home‚Äù, several times I sent the quadcopter so far that I lost sight of it, but switching the mode, he obediently flew home.  But in a strong wind you need to be careful, as the quadrocopter tilts in this mode is not enough to fight the wind and it flies in another direction.  And when the gust of wind subsides, he again flies to the owner. <br><br>  Photo and video from the side provided the organizer of trips <a href="http://www.outdoorukraine.com/content/view/1127/">Cyril Yasko</a> . <br><br>  That's all, successful flight, you wish the service of choosing gadgets <a href="http://dronk.ru/">Dronk.Ru</a> <br>  Do not forget to subscribe to our <a href="http://geektimes.ru/company/dronk/blog/">blog</a> , there will be many more interesting things. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/366299/">https://habr.com/ru/post/366299/</a></p>
