  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Who needs these CRM systems?</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Since we appeared on Habr√©, we managed to collect an impressive collection of questions, judgments and misconceptions about CRM.  We have already read and heard more than once that this evil sysadmin is taking away client bases, and not at all, that Excel with a couple of hundred macros, one left, does accounting systems, what CRM sees what the employee does in the workplace (and winks at him), that employees will still ruin any deployment, etc.  etc.  In general, all these vendors invent, but in fact, CRM-systems are not needed by the business, because it is too much stress, a lot of tasks and in general ... <i><font color="#999999">(see picture)</font></i> <i><br><br></i> <div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/23e/419/c11/23e419c11d3de670e2d7d65d93982f9d.png"></div><a name="habracut"></a><br>  We at <a href="http://www.regionsoft.ru/">RegionSoft</a> patiently read the comments and personal addresses, discussed something, answered someone, took something into account, but at the end of the year we decided to release an article with a real answer - who needs these CRMs and, briefly, why. <br><br><h2>  Let's start with our own statistics </h2><br>  We unloaded data from our CRM and considered which industries we have the most customers in.  The diagram shows data from a sample of 16,838 of our customers: those who already have <b><a href="http://www.regionsoft.ru/">RegionSoft CRM</a></b> , who are in the process of implementation and who are in the process of making a purchase decision.

    <img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/abb/ea3/a92/abbea3a92f6c1d707acbd8c51ad88dbd.png"><br><br>  The diagram is worth a comment.  As you can see, <b>ad agencies</b> are leading in their pure form (14%), and this is not surprising - back in the distant 90s these were the first teams that realized the importance of each client and began to perceive the customer base as an asset - the same as equipment or building.  Additionally, it is worth noting that it is the client base of advertising agencies - tidbits for competitors and the object of theft from unreliable employees.  Therefore, the introduction of CRM for them is also an objective desire to manage data security. <br><br>  And if you take aggregated, then <b>trade</b> leads the most <b>: wholesale (14%) and retail (12%)</b> .  And this area is a huge field for our practice and for interesting introductions.  So, on our account, including the automation of a giant supermarket with its own production, where we have automated everything: from the work of cash registers and accounting to multi-production for the hot shop.  Another interesting and ‚Äúlong-playing‚Äù case is the automation of a consumer consortium for which we have built everything: from physical security systems in warehouses to monitoring the actions of storekeepers.  And, of course, all this is done based on the flagship solution RegionSoft CRM.  Of course, retail and any other trade in general need a CRM system.  And this is not the case when you can breed a zoo from software - only end-to-end automation guarantees the safety and speed of service. <br><br>  Here are the reasons for the need for CRM trading companies. <br><br><ul><li>  Accumulation, storage and processing of customer base.  For example, if earlier only Ile de Bote or L'Etoile were in the purse of our beautiful employees, now cardholders are cracking at the seams: any little shop or even an island in the mall will certainly give a card - that is, it has a loyalty card, a CRM system for program management, does segmented mailings.  The same thing happens with any stores: from spare parts for PC to household and grocery.  And by the way, it is CRM-systems that make it possible to reduce the cost of loyalty programs. <br></li><li>  Warehouse management.  Is the Russian mentality so arranged, is it bad for people to live, or does kleptomania progress, but they steal everything and everyone.  So, you need to control the storekeepers and see the withdrawal of goods online - through the CRM-system.  Well, as a pleasant and useful bonus - through CRM, you can send orders for production, write out the entire package of documents, get goods through barcodes, etc. <br></li><li>  Assortment management is another important thing in the trade.  There is seasonality, there are consumer tastes, weather, fashion and many other factors that easily turn a fashionable spring spinner into an autumn stale product.  Accordingly, with the help of CRM, it is possible to analyze demand trends and remove unnecessary goods from the range.  Thus, the trading company avoids the glut. <br></li></ul><br>  And, of course, all the basic functionality also does not stand aside: reports, KPI, tasks and planning, etc. <br><br>  <b>Production (cumulatively 19%)</b> is also an interesting industry, which, at first glance, a man in the street, can not be linked to the CRM system.  However, CRM is also different.  There are for small companies and startups that can draw beautiful dashboards and designer menus, and there are systems that include a production module.  And we at one time went to this step and developed RegionSoft CRM Enterprise, which, in fact, is ERP and is intended just for production.  The most important functions of CRM in production companies are warehouse management, project management, procurement logistics, and production resource management. <br><br>  We don‚Äôt even need to argue about why CRM is needed in <b>the service industry</b> - this is exactly the industry about which all vendors speak with one voice: the client is in the center, loyalty is in focus, planning and execution of tasks are exactly on time in priority. <br><br>  But we are just proud of <b>7% of TV and radio companies</b> in our client portfolio and there is hardly a second CRM from a ‚Äúgeneral profile‚Äù vendor that media workers are so interested in.  And all because we have created a real industry system - RegionSoft CRM Media with media planning, ratings, on-line references and downloading advertisements to on-air stations directly from the system.  The industry version has been successfully tested and has a steady demand among TV and radio companies from both Russian and neighboring countries.  To be honest, we didn‚Äôt hold a positioning with competitors (tear off our marketer‚Äôs hands or whatever they call it!), But employees of television and radio companies say that this is what we need! <br><br><h2>  So how to understand that a business needs CRM? </h2><br>  Business often resists the introduction of CRM, postpones until later: difficult, difficult to choose, a lot of information, intimidated forums.  It seems that all that matters is: manage contacts, reminders and telephony.  If you think so, then it was necessary to implement yesterday.  There is a whole list of signs that clearly indicate that a business needs a CRM system. <br><br>  <b>Sales department of more than one person.</b>  First of all, this is a huge risk - leaving the employees together with the base, ‚Äúfights‚Äù for customers, ignoring reports, kickbacks and other processes that hurt the revenue and make it possible to profit from business.  CRM-system should not be just some kind of DBMS with a shell, but the only repository of the company's history and all transactions.  Then there will be protection and order.  It‚Äôs almost like an ad: ‚ÄúNot in CRM, which means it wasn‚Äôt‚Äù. <br><br>  <b>Young business</b> often avoids automation for various reasons: no money, no feeling that the company will soar.  However, this is the best time to implement CRM - first at low speeds, the basic version, and then in the case of growth can be scaled.  Such an opportunity is almost any experienced vendor.  The first reason for early automation is the accumulation of the entire customer base from scratch and initially high standards of customer service.  The second reason is associated with a period of growth.  When a business starts to develop intensively and comes to the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãimplementing CRM, it will be necessary to distract from the main processes managers, managers, and train staff.  Such breaks are not at all what the company needs at the peak of growth.  But to increase the CRM in parallel with the development of the company - a thoughtful approach. <br><blockquote>  <i>As a graphic example, we can cite our progenitor company, in which, in the distant 90s and 00s, customers were registered in Microsoft Excel.</i>  <i>The key word here is ‚ÄúVELS‚Äù, because I cannot imagine how any enterprise can work at all without taking into account its main asset - clients.</i>  <i>Yes, the registry was, there was information about contacts, addresses, phone numbers ... Everything was in a single tablet, which, even with a strong desire, could be sorted alphabetically or by phone number.</i>  <i>Everything was good as long as the business was young and there were not so many customers - a couple thousand.</i> <i><br><br></i>  <i>However, soon there was a need not for simple accounting of the client registry, but for various types of automation - preparing reports, tracking business processes, assigning various specialized properties, ranking and dividing clients into segments for organizing a focal impact.</i>  <i>And here fine Microsoft Excel already did not cope with these tasks.</i>  <i>I understand that many will immediately say: "But what about Visual Basic for Applications?".</i>  <i>No, it's all wrong.</i>  <i>You can, of course, make a monster on VBA, but this will simply be unreliable and inconvenient, and moreover, is not focused on the joint network work of many users.</i>  <i>As a result, as a result of the analysis of new tasks, it was decided to introduce a CRM system.</i>  <i>We tried several ready-made solutions, but not finding the right one, we launched our own development, which has now grown into <a href="http://www.regionsoft.ru/">RegionSoft CRM</a> .</i> </blockquote><br>  <b>Mature business</b> is not only a charge of experience, commercial thinking, but also a load of past years, which is most often expressed in the accumulated fleet of programs and utilities and in the huge client base a la ‚ÄúNew Folder 2 to disassemble customers 2005‚Äù.  CRM effectively relieves both problems.  You can grind client base, rotate between managers and squeeze revenue out of it - all because the old friend (well, that is, the client) is better (well, that is, easier and cheaper to develop) the new two.  It is much easier and cheaper to sell to someone with whom you have already touched or even worked, than to attract, lure, process and bring to the purchase of a new client.  As for the software zoo, by installing CRM, you can get rid of some warehouse programs, absolutely all planners, contact managers and many office tools for which the business has paid for many years.  That is also cost saving. <br><br>  <b>A company that wants to build a real marketing</b> , and not send PR people to social events, must acquire CRM.  We have bad news for everyone - the old methods of smelling products and services no longer work, so you need to focus on segmentation and creating individual offers.  Properly accumulated in CRM and processed base allows you to build marketing in such a way that all of the 100,000 customers will think that they are your first and only.  Awesome feeling to buy. <br><br>  <b>A company that is sorely lacking in hands and brains</b> can use a CRM system to unload employees and save effort, time and nerves.  Here, the first violin is played by planning and streamlined business processes.  And it is time to stop being afraid of process modeling and consider business processes as a lot of big business.  They really help everyone: the routine is defeated, responsible, clearly, the human factor is minimized.  No one, not even the micro company itself, will refuse such a set. <br><br>  <b>The company, which desperately needs to be facing the customers</b> , desperately needs a CRM system.  These are mainly B2C and, of course, B2B, in which design work and close, tied-up deadline customer relations (advertising, design, development, etc.) prevail.  In CRM, you can control deadlines, set KPIs (we have normal ones, not minus 20% for being late), conduct group planning, delegate tasks, create private clients and then analyze everything in order to work even more efficiently. <br><br>  A CRM system helps to see problems and gaps, recognize them early and minimize them.  You can even create an internal training center based on it - for example, select the best deals and calls, in order to easily adapt newcomers and form best practices.  Or you can create a call center and provide outsourcing services.  The most advanced can become a distributor of CRM and make money on it as a new business.  There are many possibilities.  And of course, the main thing is safety.  Yes, you can steal data from anywhere, but in professional circles, the level of security is always determined by the cost of opening it to protect. <br><br>  By the way, we noticed that companies with implemented CRM are transformed from one more point of view - they are starting to feel themselves a team with the image of professionals.  And this is a very profitable sense of business.  Which, by the way, for any money you will not buy. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/345230/">https://habr.com/ru/post/345230/</a></p>
