  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Choosing a specialty for IT</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Finished school?  It's time to go to college.  And of course on the programmer, right?  NO NOT LIKE THIS!  And I will explain why. <br><br>  So, after 4 years of studying in an IT specialty, we will issue the following subjects: <br>  1) Basics of programming.  Pascal, C. At the time of the training he knew them.  These are the basics, and if you are not lucky with the teacher, then circumstances may be such that you will be lost to IT.  Sad?  And the time spent will be rather big.  It is easier and faster to learn everything. <br>  2) OOP.  As a rule, several courses, 2-6 with completely different names.  Learn C ++ (of course the basics), GUI, design basics.  You will not learn any techniques, if you are lucky to the maximum - then the UML will be told.  Of course, after reading a dozen books at home (OOP / methods / UML / refactoring / design), you can learn a <b>lot more</b> .  It is easier and faster to learn everything. <br>  3) Databases.  If you are unlucky, access will end.  If you're lucky, you'll learn the basics of SQL.  Or even the basics, if you are lucky. <br>  On the other hand, if you study on your own, it will take much less time, and as an additional bonus - a cash reward for orders;) <br>  As you have already guessed, it is easier and faster to learn everything yourself. <br>  4) Prologue, Lisp, etc.  Surely they will not be useful for practice.  But still, even if you do not teach them, then you probably want to learn their basics.  Those.  before the start of the relevant subject you will be familiar with them if there is an initiative. <br>  5) Broadcast.  At the level at which it is taught in most universities, it is not necessary: ‚Äã‚Äãas a rule, the information is greatly simplified, and in the future it will only be needed by a couple of percent of students, but they still have to learn everything from the beginning, since before that there was only an introduction with the subject. <br>  It would be better if Regexp was taught.  Which you will love to know. <br>  6) OS.  The only course that gave me knowledge, but only because I don‚Äôt need it and I would never teach it myself.  Why should a webmaster be able to work with mail slots under windows?) In any case, if I were a systems specialist, I would definitely know that.  And, by the way, I knew the Nix system calls (I experimented with studying C), and I was not interested in the implementation of this under windows. <br>  To sum up a little: the initiative man already knows what is being studied at the university. <br><br>  <b>What to do?</b> <br>  Higher education may still be needed, do not give it up. <br>  However, it is not so easy to study on IT-specialty.  Therefore, there is a very good option: go to the economy / law, and you will kill two birds with one stone: the excessive complexity of training and the lack of new knowledge in IT specialties. <br>  Especially since the economic type of specialty will give the skills of orientation in business that you need.
