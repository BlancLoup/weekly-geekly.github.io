  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Crayfish. What to do and what not to do. Personal experience</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  About a year ago I responded extensively <a href="https://geektimes.ru/post/265888/">to an article about cancer</a> .  This caused a lot of comments and genuine interest in the topic.  I did not write for a long time, because I was not sure that everything would end up well.  Unfortunately, not well ended.  This article is mainly about not doing anything. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  October 27, 2016, my wife died.  And now I will try to describe everything that happened and add some of my conclusions.  I believe that an honest presentation of the facts and an attempt to analyze them also make sense.  Perhaps someone will save a life. <br><br>  In the above article in the comments I stopped at the fact that we changed our place of residence and lived for a year on the Black Sea coast.  Indeed, there was a serious improvement, no relapses were observed and the tests were good.  We decided that we were cured. <br><br>  This was the main mistake.

      The first commandment for a cancer patient - you need to understand that this is for life.  You can live in such a way that the cancer will hide somewhere inside and will not manifest itself.  But he is not going anywhere.  But it is necessary to return to an unorganized diet and not to give the body physical exertion - it will return much faster than it can be assumed. <br><br>  Literally two months after I happily described in the comments about our successes, everything came back.  Bad tests, terrible pain, general deterioration.  Again we are going to Moscow for a survey and are prescribing a new course of chemistry. <br><br>  Yes, now existing drugs have reached a new level.  They are more easily tolerated and actually kill cancer cells.  But we must understand that each chemistry in the strongest way reduces the immune system and the overall resistance of the organism.  With each chemistry a person becomes weaker.  At some point, something will refuse. <br><br>  So, half a year of chemistry seems to be much better.  Oncomarkers show no cancer cells.  We are going to the coolest PET scan at the moment (positron emission tomography complete with computed tomography) - at the moment the most accurate way to find out if there are cancer cells in the body or not.  All is clear too.  Joy is no limit. <br><br>  And we once again make the same mistake - we believe that we have recovered.  The wife decides that she can live as before.  There is something you want to stop daily runs.  But in early September 2016, again, bad tests.  Again we are going to Moscow for a consultation.  And here comes what should happen after 26 chemistry - one of the internal organs refuses.  The first ambulance, which was called just stupidly left, looking at the documents with analyzes on oncology.  They said they can not do anything.  We moved to an apartment in another district of Moscow and called another ambulance without showing oncology tests.  They took us away.  Further, in a personal conversation, I described the situation to the doctor.  They could not drive us out of the hospital.  Young doctors rushed into battle and gathered to cut.  I wrote waivers three times.  As a result, a famous professor came to the round on Monday and forbade cutting, saying that she would die on the operating table. <br><br>  Further, in a private conversation, he said that nothing could be done.  According to the analysis and MRI metastases already throughout the abdominal cavity.  If you do not cut it - maybe she will live another month, maybe a year, but during the operation she will die on the operating table. <br><br>  And one more important comment from him - ‚ÄúIn the case of oncology, oncologists should be contacted when everything else has been repetitive.  Oncologists are not the ones who treat. ‚Äù  After his instructions, the nurses even stopped approaching her. <br><br>  I buy plane tickets and take my wife home.  Her oncologist, who is called by her doctor at the door, directly says to me that nothing can be done and stupidly colitis painkillers. <br>  More we did not call her. <br><br>  Then I began to treat her according to the method of Broyce.  For a month she ate exclusively beet and carrot juice.  For a month she lost 15 pounds.  The goal was the following - not even recovery, but an attempt to drive the cancer cells into the far corner. <br><br>  The idea was as follows.  Maybe now oncologists will pounce on me with accusations of all mortal sins, but this is not only my opinion and a significant number of people because of this either got rid of cancer or lived much longer.  Cancer cells are somewhat simpler than cells of our body.  They multiply faster, but consume only prepared nutrients.  Simple proteins and carbohydrates.  If a person eats only hard-to-digest and requires considerable effort to assimilate the products - then the cancer cells will have nothing to eat.  And the body will still receive the minimum dose of nutrients.  Fresh juices are ideal. <br>  The point was that the tests would not show problems with oncology and then the doctors would undertake an operation on the intestines. <br><br>  After a month of such a diet, we quietly made tests for tumor markers through a nurse.  They were normal and we called an ambulance.  Of course.  It was a month of terrible suffering for her, but we achieved ours.  The tests showed this. <br><br>  She had an operation.  After the operation, the doctor said that they did not see any traces of the tumor and metastases.  Even expressed the opinion that it is possible she will now begin to recover and a good outcome is quite likely. <br><br>  But after a week she became sharply worse, she lost consciousness and was taken to intensive care.  An hour later for an operation.  During the second operation, she died.  Could not stand the heart. <br>  The doctor who performed the operation afterwards said that the entire abdominal cavity was already in metastasis.  This is confirmed by numerous cases that describe that if there is an abnormal diet, the cancer can progress so rapidly that a few weeks is enough for the cancer to affect more organs than before. <br>  My assumption was that, after the operation, she was given powerful restorative therapy ‚Äî including pouring glucose into liters and feeding protein shakes ‚Äî including stimulating cancer.  But this is just my guess. <br><br>  From the experience of these two and a half years I have derived the following convictions.  Once again, this is just my opinion.  But maybe this will help someone. <br><br><ol><li>  Different people have a different margin of safety - for someone just to be different, and someone will get sick seriously and for a long time.  And sometimes changes in the mechanisms of self-healing reach some critical point and hello oncology.  Therefore, if a person understands that he has no iron health, one must be very attentive to what is happening with the body. <br><br></li><li>  You can eat everything, but you should try to eat only food made from fresh produce.  Any deep processing products are a great treat for cancer cells.  And of course meat should be less than vegetables and fruits.  Fresh.  It is much more difficult for the cancer cells to assimilate their nutrients, and our normal ones easily assimilate them. <br><br></li><li>  Be sure to be physical activity above average.  This does not mean that it is necessary to engage in exhausting exercises.  This means that at least once a day, the heart must pound so that the bloodstream can carry all sorts of unhealthy waste from all distant corners of the body.  3-5 kilometers on foot a day with quick steps is quite enough.  More already at will.  There are precedents when people went to the state without cancer, starting to run 20 km a day from stage 4.  But this, of course, is very hard and not everyone can.  And not everyone will help. <br><br></li><li>  Next is a little psychology, religion and mysticism.  You have to take your life as it is.  Do not be angry or offended.  Do not interfere with yourself.  A bad mental attitude can even negate a very good diet and proper exercise. <br><br></li><li>  And one more thing, very controversial, but I am convinced that this is important.  We are in this world to create something.  It is easier for women to give birth and raise children and you already need this world, nature, God (it is this explanation that is important to someone).  Men and women without children need to create something else.  It may even be little things.  The main thing is to do it with the soul, creatively.  With the soul to cook, sew, knit, make repairs in their homes.  Let in trifles, but create.  In my opinion, this is our destination in this life.  Even if no one sees and does not appreciate.  And then nature itself will fight for your life, because it needs you.  You make her better. </li></ol><br>  And the MOST IMPORTANT thing - a person who has got cancer must always remember - THIS IS FOR ALL THE LIFE.  It is impossible to recover from cancer at this stage in the development of medicine.  But it is possible to live in such a way that he hides and does not manifest himself. <br><br>  I hope that everything written possible to help someone.  There are examples.  It would not want to deny this accusations on the body of medicine, which call themselves oncologists. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/398663/">https://habr.com/ru/post/398663/</a></p>
