  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Google Adsense: 15 Things to Know</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  As soon as I started blogging, ‚ÄúGoogle Adsense‚Äù (hereinafter - simply Adsense) became my first advertising tool.  Many people assured me that it is very simple - all you have to do is just copy and paste the code into your blog, and you can immediately start making money.  So, my friends, this is probably the biggest lie, of those that walk on the blogosphere.  Everything is far from simple. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  I removed Adsense from my blog, for the reasons I‚Äôll cover in this article.  I used it for about two years and during that time I learned something about how it works, and I would like to share my experience with you. <br><br>  1. You will be better off if your site is on the first page of search engines. <br><br>  2. On the ads most often clicked visitors who come from search engines.  Regular readers do not notice advertising (they are ‚Äúad-blind‚Äù). 
      <br>
        <script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>
        <ins class="adsbygoogle"
          style="display:block; text-align:center;"
          data-ad-layout="in-article"
          data-ad-format="fluid"
          data-ad-client="ca-pub-6974184241884155"
          data-ad-slot="8945601208"></ins>
        <script>
          (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
        </script>
      <br>
      3. Analyze your traffic from search services to understand exactly what people are looking for.  This will tell you what they want to click on ads on your site. <br><br>  4. If your site stores a lot of information, as in the encyclopedia, then people most likely will not want to click on advertising.  If the information is not very much, then visitors will probably click on an ad to find what they really need. <br><br>  5. Adsense brings less profit in blogs about blogs than in any other blogs.  In such cases, it is best to sell advertising space 125x125.  This is because those who are interested in reading blogs about blogs come most likely from social media, social.  bookmarks, etc., and not from the search engine. <br><br>  6. Traffic is not equivalent to advertising clicks.  He is different.  Search engine traffic pays off better than social media traffic. <br><br>  7. The traffic from social media reduces the CTR, this can reduce the profitability of the entire account, including other sites with Adsense.  Therefore, I do not recommend placing Adsense in blogs that attract a lot of social media attention. <br><br>  8. To place ads in posts or comments, much better than in the sidebar 'ah - narrow columns on the side. <br><br>  9. Position Adsense on your own and with your size.  Do not annoy readers by filling the site with ads that complicate navigation and make the site look like doorway. <br><br>  10. If your goal is to make money through Adsense, then limit or do not use other forms of advertising that can distract the reader.  For example, if you have affiliate links and Adsense, then you risk that the reader follows the link, not Adsense.  In this case, you will not receive anything if there is no sale through the affiliate program, and the Adsense CTR will also decrease. <br><br>  11. Not everyone can earn on Adsense.  Revenues from Adsense can be very depressing, especially if you don‚Äôt know which ads are paying well and how to get the ‚Äúright‚Äù traffic to your site in order to convert it into clicks.  There are no magic formulas for getting thousands of dollars just through advertising.  Do not forget it! <br><br>  12. Based on the experience of my sites, I can say that the price per ad decreases in the following order: Travel ‚Üí Gadgets ‚Üí Finance / Laws ‚Üí Fishing ‚Üí Food. <br><br>  13. Focus on the content to get more relevant ads.  This will increase the chance that they will be clicked.  Sites like diaries have less chance of a good income. <br><br>  14. Keywords that are correctly matched to the post (and to the entire site) will help increase the flow of relevant ads and increase the place in the search results. <br><br>  15. Those who give advice on making money with Adsense, rarely have it on their website.  This is because they make money through Adsense on their other sites (and which they most likely do not talk about). <br><br>  Are you using Google Adsense?  Share your experiences in the comments! <br><br>  <a href="http://blogsreview.ru/event.php%3Fid%3D4" title="A source">Source - original notes</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/24611/">https://habr.com/ru/post/24611/</a></p>
