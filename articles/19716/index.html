  <section class="page js-page"><h1>The Parable of the Good and the Bad</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Once Denis went for a walk with his friend Petya to the park.  A friend ran to buy beer, and Denis sat down on a bench and suddenly he saw that something was lying on the other end of the bench.  Coming closer, he saw that it was a laptop.  And not just a laptop.  This laptop <br>  was covered in leather and looked very expensive.  Denis just started looking at him, as his friend Peter came up with a beer.  As soon as he heard that Denis had found a laptop, he immediately said: ‚ÄúDamn, how lucky you are, eh!  You are not going to give it to the owner, I hope? ‚Äù.  Denis said that he does not see any luck in this.  He actually wanted to return the thing, but there was no information about the owner in the laptop, and Denis took it for himself and began to use it. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Two weeks later, when Denis was sitting on the same bench with a laptop and writing a program, two young sports men passed by him.  One of them looked at Denis with a laptop and told his comrade: ‚ÄúLook, like our boss has a laptop that was stolen from him!‚Äù.  ‚ÄúWell, yes, exactly,‚Äù the second one confirmed, ‚Äúthis is what he is! .. Hey, man, where do you have a laptop from?‚Äù.  Denis tried to explain that he had found him, but quickly got a couple of blows to the head.  The guys took his laptop, and even grabbed a mobile phone.  With a concussion, Denis was taken away by an ambulance.  Friends came to Denis to the hospital with fruit.  Petya said: ‚ÄúYes, Denis, you are not lucky, your mobile phone was taken away.  It would be better if you didn‚Äôt find this laptop. ‚Äù  Denis said to this: ‚ÄúOh well, nothing bad, and nothing good either.  I just don't have a mobile now, that's all. ‚Äù  And smiled. <br>  The very next day, Denis was discharged, he came home and he learned from the answering machine that he had been called from a large IT company and asked to be contacted.  Denis called this number, introduced himself and heard: "The director wanted to talk to you, I am connecting."  The director introduced himself as Ivan Petrovich and said: ‚ÄúDenis, I apologize for my children, they took your cell phone from you.  My laptop is really, I forgot it in the park.  Come pick up your mobile phone.  And at the same time, I looked at what you wrote for the programs here, like nothing.  I need an intelligent programmer, come and talk. ‚Äù  Denis arrived and was interviewed by a large company as a result of the interview.  His salary has grown 8 times.  Friends could not believe that this is possible.  Petya said: ‚ÄúWell, damn it, friend, lucky you!  Not everyone has such happiness.  Not for nothing, it turns out, he got something in the brain.  You are fine now. ‚Äù  Denis replied: ‚ÄúNo, neither good nor bad.  I just now get a salary of 8 times more. " <br>  Denis worked for the third month in this office, when suddenly the police came to their company.  It turned out that this company was engaged in some obscure money laundering cases, did not pay taxes, and was still engaged in something that Denis did not recognize.  With some employees of the company was taken on his own recognizance.  Denis was among the suspects in complicity.  Many employees for some reason testified that he was actively involved in criminal activities.  Then Denis was charged and as a measure of restraint he was taken into custody.  Denis was in prison for the second week already, waiting for his case to be considered in court, when Petya came to him.  Petya worked as a lawyer and managed to secure the interests of Denis during the investigation.  After discussing all the questions with Denis, Petya sighed and said: ‚ÄúYes, Denis, you are not lucky, it turns out.  It would be better if you did not take that laptop yourself.  Now it is not known how much you still have to sit here. ‚Äù  Denis said: "Nothing bad, nothing good, just now I live here." <br>  A week later, in the middle of the night, an explosion occurred in the house where Denis used to live.  Gas exploded in the apartment of a neighbor Denis.  The house was badly damaged, many people suffered.  Denis was saved only because he was not in the apartment.  A week later, the investigation figured out that Denis was not involved in the crimes, and he was released. <br>  Friends gathered in a restaurant to celebrate the event.  Petya was given the floor and he said: ‚ÄúDenis!  How lucky you are.  You could die if you didn't go to jail!  Let's drink to ensure that everything is so good and so on. ‚Äù  Denis did not answer.  Just smiled. </div>
