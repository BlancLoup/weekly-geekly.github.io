    <h2>  Why do you need it </h2><br>  On January 29, Axios <a href="https://www.axios.com/trump-team-debates-nationalizing-5g-network-f1e92a49-60f2-4e3e-acd4-f3eb03d910ff.html">published a</a> paper stating that the US needs to build a centralized nationwide 5G network over the next three years.  The US administration believes that such efforts are needed to <a href="https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2018/1/29/16946582/trump-5g-proposal-wireless-ajit-pai-fcc-china">counter</a> cyber threats from China (as Vox reports, with the advent of 5G, the situation with cyber attacks can only get worse).  Therefore, the document proposed by the Trump administration requires that the United States immediately begin preparing for the implementation of 5G. <br><br>  The document compares 5G technology with the construction of an interstate highway system that Eisenhower <a href="https://goo.gl/XvC7gk">started</a> in 1956.  This underlines the importance of new-generation networks for the country's national security and for gaining an advantage in the race with China, Vox <a href="https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2018/1/29/16946582/trump-5g-proposal-wireless-ajit-pai-fcc-china">notes</a> . <br><br>  Reuters, <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-trump-5g/trump-security-team-sees-building-u-s-5g-network-as-option-idUSKBN1FH103">citing</a> an anonymous source, reports that the US-China technology relationship is rather tense.  In 2012, US intelligence agencies <a href="https://intelligence.house.gov/sites/intelligence.house.gov/files/documents/huawei-zte%2520investigative%2520report%2520(final).pdf">were testing</a> whether the equipment of the Chinese giants Huawei and ZTE was capable of spying on America‚Äôs telecommunications or threatening them in any way.  And in December 2017, the government <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-at-t-huawei-tech/huaweis-att-u-s-smartphone-deal-collapses-idUSKBN1EX29E">banned</a> AT &amp; T from offering Huawei smartphones to its customers.  However, China denies any involvement in espionage.  Chinese diplomat Cui Tiankai <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/news/2018/01/29/trump-administration-considering-government-takeover-5-g-network-report-says/1074159001/">said</a> last week that Chinese companies are selling their products to the United States, not to keep track of users. <br><br>  A representative of the US Presidential Administration <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/news/2018/01/29/trump-administration-considering-government-takeover-5-g-network-report-says/1074159001/">told</a> USA Today that the document published by Axios is already outdated, but the strategy stated in it <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/NSS-Final-12-18-2017-0905.pdf">remains</a> the same - to improve the infrastructure by deploying 5G across the country.  New telecommunications will allow the United States to improve market competitiveness, improve the environment and quality of life, the document says.  Therefore, the nationalization of the network is probably one of the ways to solve these problems. <br><br><h2>  How it will work </h2><br>  The document offers two scenarios.  First, the government builds a common network at its own expense and then leases it to operators like AT &amp; T, Verizon and T-Mobile.  Second, each provider creates its own 5G network, and these networks compete in the market. <br><br>  However, in Axios they <a href="https://www.axios.com/trump-team-debates-nationalizing-5g-network-f1e92a49-60f2-4e3e-acd4-f3eb03d910ff.html">note</a> that although the second option would cause less concern in the market, the probability of its realization is extremely low.  According to the initiators of the idea, the first option will allow you to quickly build a network and make it more secure compared to the second option. <br><br>  It is planned to issue a single standard for American 5G-networks, which will regulate the placement of special equipment.  It is assumed that the initial functionality of the network will be available in a year and a half, and expanded - in 2. The network will work in full force in three years. <br><br>  However, according <a href="https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2018/1/29/16946582/trump-5g-proposal-wireless-ajit-pai-fcc-china">to</a> Vox, the administration will not be able to meet this deadline.  To complete the project by 2021, it had to start in 2015‚Äì2016.  In addition, the nationalized network will cost the state dearly: the private sector <a href="https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2018/1/29/16946582/trump-5g-proposal-wireless-ajit-pai-fcc-china">plans to</a> invest $ 275 billion in 5G infrastructure. <br><br>  The project is still under consideration.  A representative of the administration, who wished to remain anonymous, <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/news/2018/01/29/trump-administration-considering-government-takeover-5-g-network-report-says/1074159001/">claims</a> that the document will fall on the president‚Äôs table no sooner than in 6‚Äì8 months. <br><br><h2>  How the experts responded </h2><br>  Height Securities analyst Clayton Allen (Clayton Allen) <a href="https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2018/1/29/16946582/trump-5g-proposal-wireless-ajit-pai-fcc-china">believes</a> that the White House will not be able to deploy such a large-scale project, pay for it and leave private companies aside. <br><br>  Meredith Attwell Baker (Meredith Attwell Baker), president of the CTIA trade group, <a href="https://twitter.com/CTIA/status/958003178775212032">said</a> that the industry understands the significance of winning the 5G race for the nation.  However, Meredith insists that the policy of free market relations is a direct path to this victory. <br><br>  Chairman of the Federal Communications Commission Ajit Pai also <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2018/01/28/trump-administration-could-build-nationalized-5g-mobile-network.html">spoke</a> against the government proposal.  He believes that any government efforts to create a nationalized 5G network will be too expensive and will prevent the United States from being the first to launch a new generation network.  Thirty years of experience in developing wireless solutions shows that it is the market, and not the government, that is able to promote new technologies. <br><br>  It is worth noting that all five members of the Federal Commission <a href="https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2018/1/29/16946582/trump-5g-proposal-wireless-ajit-pai-fcc-china">criticized the</a> initiative.  Republican Brendan Carr (Brendan Carr) <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/news/2018/01/29/trump-administration-considering-government-takeover-5-g-network-report-says/1074159001/">called the</a> project "doomed to failure", and Democrat Jessica Rosenvorssel (Jessica Rosenworcel) <a href="https://twitter.com/JRosenworcel/status/957999959307116545">agreed</a> that the United States is seeking to deploy 5G first, but the proposed method, according to her, will not help achieve the goal. <br><br>  Telecommunication companies of America reacted negatively to the <a href="https://www.axios.com/trump-team-debates-nationalizing-5g-network-f1e92a49-60f2-4e3e-acd4-f3eb03d910ff.html">proposal of the</a> government.  AT &amp; T and Verizon, who <a href="https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2018/1/29/16946582/trump-5g-proposal-wireless-ajit-pai-fcc-china">plan to</a> launch 5G later this year, are not very pleased with the state's intervention.  AT &amp; T claims that thanks to multibillion-dollar investments by American companies, work on creating the infrastructure for the launch of 5G is already underway, and the network will be put into operation without government intervention.  In Verizon, the initiative of the presidential administration has not yet commented. <br><br><h2>  Implementation difficulties </h2><br>  Representatives of telecommunications companies and industry experts <a href="https://www.axios.com/nationalizing-5g-network-raises-a-number-of-concerns-1517168611-4c95d53f-7013-42b9-bcdf-9ef7bbdfde14.html">highlight the</a> following difficulties in project implementation. <br><br>  <b>1. Termination of private investment.</b>  All major American providers have already invested and continue to invest heavily in the development of 5G networks.  According <a href="https://www.axios.com/nationalizing-5g-network-raises-a-number-of-concerns-1517168611-4c95d53f-7013-42b9-bcdf-9ef7bbdfde14.html">to</a> Chetan Sharma, an expert in the field of wireless communications, the nationalization of 5G without substantial investment can cause discontent on the part of the industry.  And creating a competitive market in a shared network can be a daunting task.  Moreover, it is not yet clear whether representatives of small and medium-sized businesses will be able to gain access to the nationalized network or not. <br><br>  <b>2. Unrealistic terms.</b>  Axios, referring to an anonymous informant, <a href="https://www.axios.com/nationalizing-5g-network-raises-a-number-of-concerns-1517168611-4c95d53f-7013-42b9-bcdf-9ef7bbdfde14.html">reports</a> that it is impossible to deploy 5G across the country in 3 years.  Even taking into account private investment and in a competitive environment, operators will need 10 years to create full-fledged 5G networks.  In addition, any wireless connection depends on the fiber-optic networks that need to be updated. <br><br>  <b>3. Complexity of interaction at the regional level.</b>  State and local governments will not be very pleased that the state takes away from them the ability to decide where to place network equipment.  The document states that the state will be able to refer to its right to forcibly alienate private property in order to <a href="https://www.axios.com/nationalizing-5g-network-raises-a-number-of-concerns-1517168611-4c95d53f-7013-42b9-bcdf-9ef7bbdfde14.html">free up</a> frequencies for the creation of 5G.  This can lead to misunderstanding between the state and commercial consumers. <br><br>  <b>4. Questions about security guarantees.</b>  One of the goals of the proposal is to create a secure network to prevent security threats from China and other countries.  The problem is that the work of 5G is based on several types of networks, and the network security is <a href="https://www.axios.com/nationalizing-5g-network-raises-a-number-of-concerns-1517168611-4c95d53f-7013-42b9-bcdf-9ef7bbdfde14.html">determined by the</a> security of its connection points, which will be quite difficult to guarantee. <br><br>  <i>It <a href="https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2018/1/29/16946582/trump-5g-proposal-wireless-ajit-pai-fcc-china">is</a> worth <a href="https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2018/1/29/16946582/trump-5g-proposal-wireless-ajit-pai-fcc-china">noting</a> that, in general, this initiative in society was taken rather negatively.</i>  <i>Therefore, it is possible that things will not go further than documents on the project.</i>  <i>However, the US is not the only country that seeks 5G supremacy.</i>  <i>You can read about the projects of other countries and about the first part of the standard of new generation networks in our <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/company/vasexperts/blog/344914/">blog</a> .</i> <i><br><br></i>  <i>PS Materials on the topic from the blog on the VAS Experts website:</i> <i><br><br></i> <ul><li>  <a href="https://vasexperts.ru/blog/telekom/budushhee-uslug-operatorov-svyazi/">The future of carrier services: IT infrastructure in the cloud</a> </li><li>  <a href="https://vasexperts.ru/blog/vse-chto-vy-xoteli-znat-o-sorm-no-ustali-iskat/">Everything you wanted to know about SORM, but got tired of looking</a> </li><li>  <a href="https://vasexperts.ru/blog/telekom/internet-v-derevnyu-stroim-radiorelejnuyu-wi-fi-set/">Internet to the village - we build radio-relay Wi-Fi-network</a> </li></ul></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/347046/">https://habr.com/ru/post/347046/</a></p>
