It is the day when the game is ready and the time has come to lay it out for everyone to see.  Where to start and how not to make a mistake?  This will be discussed in this article. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/9a2/b9a/71d/9a2b9a71dbf340338359967ecc6a65ee.jpg" alt="image"></div><br><br>  <b>PS</b> The author went through everything described below personally, in order to fill as many cones as possible. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h3>  <font color="#3C3CFF">About the platform</font> </h3>

    <h4>  <font color="#0303BD">English around the head</font> </h4><br>  The first and most important feature, which the author neglected in his time, is that most users speak English. <br><br>  <a href="http://store.steampowered.com/stats/content/">Download data in different countries</a> <br><br><h6>  <font color="#000068"><b>Conclusion # 1.</b></font>  <font color="#000068">English should be basic</font> </h6><br>  Any game that has a description only in Russian / it is earlier than the English translation is doomed to negative reviews. <br>  UPD.  Thanks to <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/users/darthman/" class="user_link">Darthman</a> for the clarification.  Steam has the ability to write a different description for different languages. <br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">How to do it</b> <div class="spoiler_text"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/4f9/531/abc/4f9531abc27d4b559d7ca087971b4981.png" alt="image"><br></div></div><br><br><h6>  <font color="#000068"><b>Conclusion # 2.</b></font>  <font color="#000068">Some negatively relate to Russian loners.</font> </h6><br>  This conclusion is not obvious, but still this truth.  The first comments that my project received were extremely negative against the Russians.  And it has its roots.  Recently, a substantial part of the projects in GreenLight are from Russian-speaking developers, and their quality is clearly lower than the quality of projects that set the tone. <br><br><h4>  <font color="#0303BD">Time is working against you</font> </h4><br>  Until the moment your game goes out of sight in the general list, you will have from 1.5 to 2 days.  Further hopes for a natural interest in your project is not necessary. <br><br>  Tested on personal experience: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/8b7/669/98d/8b766998da284447b4eff6951a9a6926.png" alt="image"><br><br><h4>  <font color="#0303BD">A catchy video costs more than providing a prototype</font> </h4><br>  The game, which was laid out on the court, was attached a stripped-down version of the game on Google Play.  So here.  For one and a half days of natural interest growth, no one downloaded the prototype.  Another plus in the fact that your game has only a video and description to please people! <br><br>  Project statistics on Google Play: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/c95/bcc/a48/c95bcca48c6444378c3ec56f53c50f3c.png" alt="image"><br><br><h4>  <font color="#0303BD">Screenshots - help in quick selection</font> </h4><br>  They say that an experienced recruiter looks at your resume on average 11 seconds.  This also applies to Steam GreenLight. <br>  In some cases, the video will not be watched to the end or will cost only screenshots.  From here the following conclusion - choose the most vivid / memorable / pictorial / most fully screenshots describing your project.  From 4 to 10 (set the platform itself for you). <br><br><h4>  <font color="#0303BD">How do games get the green light?</font> </h4><br>  In waves.  Usually, every few months, a lot of games are played at once by GreenLight.  In other words: even if an active interest in your game has passed, even after several weeks, it does not mean that you have no chance. <br><br>  Thanks <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/users/n3td0g/" class="user_link">n3td0g</a> for reminding you of the missed. <br><br><h3>  <font color="#3C3CFF">What to do with all this?</font> </h3><br>  <s>So how to get into the hundreds of developers whose applications pass through the GreenLight threshold?</s> <br>  First you need to understand that for the passage is not required to enter exactly one hundred best projects. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/683/0b5/eb1/6830b5eb1134480f8e82c69d36f90aa3.png" alt="image"></div><br><br>  Whether or not you pass will be decided by the Valve employee eventually.  And he makes a decision based on votes, activity and other criteria that are hazy for us.  Therefore, all that can be done is to make your game as presentable as possible! <br><br><h4>  <font color="#0303BD">Conclusions from the above and what may come in handy</font> </h4><br><ul><li>  It is necessary to constantly maintain the information field.  You have ONLY up to two days after the launch, while your project itself attracts attention.  But it does not bring the right amount of views and approvals that are needed.  You yourself must draw attention to your project. <br>  One of the options that Steam itself offers is to provide links to other accounts, be it <a href="https://www.youtube.com/">Youtube</a> or <a href="https://sketchfab.com/">Sketchfab</a> .  Referrals from one account may be interested in working on another account, if the content is related; <br></li><li>  Simple video is not always good.  In addition to simplicity, the movie should clearly describe what exactly is your game.  Even if it takes not one, but two or even three minutes.  Want to understand that the video conveys the idea you need?  Ask your friends and loved ones!  It works especially if the person does not play games and is not familiar with other projects / games in this field / genre; <br></li><li>  English is your friend!  English is an international language and if you neglect it, you can lose a lot in your voices.  Also, the description in different languages ‚Äã‚Äãgives an additional plus in karma. </li></ul><br>  Good luck to you!  And so help you who you believe in! </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/309078/">https://habr.com/ru/post/309078/</a></p>
