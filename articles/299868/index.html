Skolkovo will be able to help with the expertise of NTI projects, he explains.  In addition, startups from Skolkovo can join the NTI working groups and vice versa - Skolkovo will provide the infrastructure to companies already entering the NTI that are not located in Skolkovo, Peskov hopes. <br><blockquote>  By integration, Peskov understands, first, the possible change in the investment mandates of both development institutions and the pooling of their financial resources.  Secondly, Skolkovo and RVC have their own start-up support programs and it is logical to synchronize their calendar, results and experts, Peskov believes.  Hence the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãplacing RVC in Skolkovo, explains Peskov: the effectiveness of integration will only increase from this. </blockquote><br>  The Foundation for Assistance to the Development of Small Forms of Enterprises in the Scientific and Technical Sphere already cooperates with the Skolkovo Foundation and with RVC, says Ivan Bortnik, Chairman of the Supervisory Board of the Foundation.  Coordination would be more effective, firstly, if development institutions together would adjust investment plans to make it easier for fund projects to receive the next round of funding at Skolkovo, he said.  Secondly, if the fund could use the expertise and infrastructure of Skolkovo.  And possible territorial integration will facilitate coordination, concludes Bortnik. <br><br>  Moreover, the government was considering the issue of <a href="https://megamozg.ru/post/24438/">joining</a> the Bortnik Fund to another institute of innovative development.  In this connection, <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%25A0%25D0%25BE%25D1%2581%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BD%25D0%25BE">Rosnano</a> and Skolkovo were mentioned in the government. <br><br>  Ekaterina Shapochka, a member of the Expert Council under the Government, claims that Skolkovo has created one of the best systems for scientific examination of projects, but it will have to be expanded, since the subject matter of NTI goes beyond the directions of Skolkovo clusters. <br><br>  On February 7, Megamind <a href="https://megamozg.ru/post/23958/">wrote</a> that a meeting was held in the Kremlin on the development of the Russian innovation system with the participation of representatives of the Expert Council under the Government.  Apparently, innovative state projects do not solve the tasks. <br><br>  At the end of January 2016, Deputy Prime Minister Arkady Dvorkovich said that ‚Äúit remains to be decided‚Äù whether the existing structures will survive - Rosnano, RVK, Bortnik Foundation, VEB Innovations, Skolkovo. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/299868/">https://habr.com/ru/post/299868/</a></p>
