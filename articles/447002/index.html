    <h2>  Evolution of the concept </h2><br>  Coworking opened in December 2011.  It occupies three floors in the building of Fyodor Shekhtel - this is a historic mansion in the Art Nouveau style on Novaya Ploshchad, built in 1909. <br><br><blockquote>  Before the revolution, the trading house of the Moscow Merchant Society was located here.  It was part of the Boyarsky Dvor business quarter and a symbol of the new economic order in Moscow and Russia at the beginning of the 20th century. </blockquote><br>  The Cabinet Lounge was conceived as a club for entrepreneurs, which was accessible only by invitation.  The founders of coworking say that they got the idea in London, where this format is widespread.  But after some time, it was decided to change the concept, and today anyone can purchase a club card. <br><br>  If we talk about prices, then a subscription with daily access costs 25 thousand rubles a month.  If you pay for three months in advance, the price tag will drop to 20 thousand rubles.  The price includes access to open meetings with business representatives from various fields.  Among the invited guests here were Ruben Vardanyan, Igor Shuvalov, Yevgeny Kaspersky, Alexander Voloshin and other significant figures.  Every last Friday of the month in co-working is held 5 O'clock Social - an informal evening where you can drink wine and chat with residents. <br><br>  Next, let's see what's inside. <br><br><h2>  Reception desk </h2><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/uf/58/po/uf58poecrxkpjxw2zrljrmx7wwk.jpeg"><br><br>  Administrators at the entrance to coworking perform the functions of personal secretaries for residents - help with the receipt and distribution of correspondence and printing documents.  Coworking also offers a ‚Äúvirtual office‚Äù service, when a hotel telephone line is allocated for the company, and the assistants receive all incoming calls. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/kn/8x/kg/kn8xkgx5j2nsdie9zo1ld0hrd9c.jpeg"><br><br>  Behind the reception desk, a corridor begins - residents call it Wall Street.  Usually, assistants accompany guests who come to clients for meetings. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/e0/vg/gn/e0vggnq5hqjhwgidqbsllfkjeh4.jpeg"><br><br>  As we were told, the design project of all the rooms was developed by the architect of the bureau Foster + Partners, who is the co-founder of the Cabinet Lounge.  The concept and branding was created by one of the leading European boutique agencies. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/sq/ab/o9/sqabo9nahbbd0ryz0sqgiejukce.jpeg"><br><br>  Since its opening, CL has collaborated with galleries and artists.  On the territory of the space posted a large number of paintings.  Coworking employees say that they independently select all works and regularly change the exposure.  Preference is given to contemporary art.  At various times, coworking was decorated with paintings by David Datun, Francisco Infante, Gregory Maslennikov.  The picture in the photo above is called ‚ÄúThe Meeting of a Boy and a Sand Peach,‚Äù written by Vladimir Logutov.  The work was provided by the Vladimir Smirnov and Konstantin Sorokin Foundation - these are co-working partners and residents. <br><br><h2>  "Lounge" </h2><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/xe/ul/2_/xeul2_ssmfv0z3663fkfauzxvpo.jpeg"><br><br>  Lounge is an open space.  Residents can occupy any place here.  To date, coworking loading is about 80%. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/er/cr/bn/ercrbnmjgdjrup9w4ey9szrrlm4.jpeg"><br><br>  Sometimes the lounge is set aside for various events. <br><br><h2>  Negotiations and offices </h2><br>  In the photo below - behind the glass - meeting rooms and office.  Previously, there were two negotiations, but they say that they had to be redone into an office because of the high demand for jobs. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/dm/9p/wc/dm9pwcqpjbygaxiqqdlcpi8rda0.jpeg"><br><br>  This office is somewhat unique, all others are located on the floor above.  They are rented for a long term.  Among the tenants in co-working are the production company "More Than Agency", the international educational organization Berlitz and recruiters from the NGK Executive Search, Walter Knoll, Paymentwall. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/4m/ay/yp/4mayypbajzvwedhn-u4auj0rz2a.jpeg"><br><br>  As for the negotiations, there are four in the coworking area - for 6 and 12 people. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/bh/ri/4h/bhri4hktcrvd5d7riaf_wjpfvwk.jpeg"><br><br>  In each of them we saw a plasma and a flipchart.  We were told that anyone can book a chat, but for residents there is a 50% discount. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/xd/jz/ok/xdjzokzamz6z9s6xatsub0zl0e4.jpeg"><br>  <sup><font color="#A9A9A9"><i>Small negotiation</i></font></sup> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/vc/f_/tt/vcf_ttpf7oiayqb2eezczoblo2q.jpeg"><br>  <sup><font color="#A9A9A9"><i>Call Room</i></font></sup> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/yx/o_/fz/yxo_fzt-0yaunink8vegkamzpee.jpeg"><br><br>  Cabinet Lounge has its own application, which was developed by partners from SpacePass.  With its help, residents can rent negotiations and pay for coworking services. <br><br>  In the near future they promise to make a chat for members of the club. <br><br><h2>  Hall "Tretyakov" </h2><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/3h/ci/vu/3hcivue8cbh4f5ur5bs3-qfejha.jpeg"><br><br>  Conference room accommodates up to 45 people.  It is mainly rented by third-party companies (Raiffeisenbank, Sberbank, Yandex, etc.) for events. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/6o/fn/vk/6ofnvkegpye8jfwfukucxyjndtq.jpeg"><br><br>  The hall is equipped with everything necessary for holding conferences. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/c3/qm/w1/c3qmw1_ma-n2cb7be3och2j83ju.jpeg"><br><br><h2>  Bar </h2><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/ow/qp/qp/owqpqpouqi79oo_lztgfrropd3k.jpeg"><br><br>  At the other end of Wall Street is a combined space: a lounge and a bar in one bottle.  Here you can hold a meeting, have lunch and a little more work. <br><br>  The menu includes breakfast, snacks, hot dishes, as well as desserts.  For a long time, co-working ordered food from restaurants, but later decided to do everything on their own. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/dw/ud/vo/dwudvohtfrmiwj15bmhzwsn_lvg.jpeg"><br><br>  CL is one of the few (if not the only) coworking with an alcohol license. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/rb/ym/jy/rbymjyxguislh_bzk086hppnknq.jpeg"><br><br>  If you wish, you can read there.  The library was collected by the founders of coworking. <br><br>  This year, it was supplemented by the books of the new co-working partner, Alpina Publisher.  They have their own regiment, which is regularly updated with new items. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/lh/gw/q6/lhgwq6kaqgk1yx1exgczkamyr9o.jpeg"><br><br><hr><br>  <b>Our (Moscow) photo tours on Habr√© <a href="https://habr.com/ru/company/vsce/blog/425623/">Klyuch</a> , <a href="https://habr.com/company/vsce/blog/413121/">#tceh</a> and <a href="https://habr.com/company/vsce/blog/419267/">SOK</a></b> <b><br></b> <br><hr><br>  <b>Our telegram microformat on IT blogs and content marketing:</b> <br><blockquote> <sup><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/xq/5o/_r/xq5o_rmc8w8juvbckkxdgn5adaw.png"></sup>  <sup><a href="https://t.me/glphmedia/47">Glyph vs full-time employee.</a></sup>  <sup><a href="https://t.me/glphmedia/47">We talk about the "inhouse-myths"</a></sup> <sup><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/xq/5o/_r/xq5o_rmc8w8juvbckkxdgn5adaw.png"></sup>  <sup><a href="https://t.me/glphmedia/31">Why companies need an English-language blog on Habr√©</a></sup> <sup><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/xq/5o/_r/xq5o_rmc8w8juvbckkxdgn5adaw.png"></sup>  <sup><a href="https://t.me/glphmedia/40">What kind of office do you have</a> and <a href="https://t.me/glphmedia/42">why is it so expensive?</a></sup> <sup><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/xq/5o/_r/xq5o_rmc8w8juvbckkxdgn5adaw.png"></sup>  <sup><a href="https://t.me/glphmedia/46">Podcast.</a></sup>  <sup><a href="https://t.me/glphmedia/46">‚ÄúI did everything - it was a funny story‚Äù</a></sup> <sup><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/xq/5o/_r/xq5o_rmc8w8juvbckkxdgn5adaw.png"></sup>  <sup><b><a href="https://t.me/glphmedia/43">Podcast.</a></b></sup>  <sup><b><a href="https://t.me/glphmedia/43">How does IT outsourcing work</a></b></sup> <sup><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/xq/5o/_r/xq5o_rmc8w8juvbckkxdgn5adaw.png"></sup>  <sup><a href="https://t.me/glphmedia/27">Why stamina is a quality you can't do without</a></sup> <sup><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/xq/5o/_r/xq5o_rmc8w8juvbckkxdgn5adaw.png"></sup>  <sup><a href="https://t.me/glphmedia/25">Not my job: ‚Äúnot my job‚Äù in editorial</a></sup> <sup><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/kq/b6/ow/kqb6owq1kjxgthtvzfv1gfms9lk.png"></sup>  <sup><a href="https://www.facebook.com/notes/glyph-media/%25D0%25B0%25D1%2580%25D1%2585%25D0%25B5%25D1%2582%25D0%25B8%25D0%25BF%25D1%258B-%25D0%25BF%25D0%25BE%25D1%2587%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BC%25D1%2583-%25D1%2580%25D0%25B0%25D0%25B1%25D0%25BE%25D1%2582%25D0%25B0%25D1%258E%25D1%2582-%25D0%25B8%25D1%2581%25D1%2582%25D0%25BE%25D1%2580%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B8/293297008204734/">Archetypes: why stories work</a></sup> <sup><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/kq/b6/ow/kqb6owq1kjxgthtvzfv1gfms9lk.png"></sup>  <sup><a href="https://www.facebook.com/notes/glyph-media/writers-block-%25D0%25B0%25D1%2583%25D1%2582%25D1%2581%25D0%25BE%25D1%2580%25D1%2581%25D0%25B8%25D1%2582%25D1%258C-%25D0%25BA%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BD%25D1%2582%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BD%25D1%2582-%25D1%258D%25D1%2582%25D0%25BE-%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B5%25D1%2587%25D0%25B5%25D1%2581%25D1%2582%25D0%25BD%25D0%25BE-%25D1%2580%25D0%25B0%25D0%25B7%25D0%25B1%25D0%25B8%25D1%2580%25D0%25B0%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BC%25D1%2581%25D1%258F-/315056492695452/">Writer's block: outsourcing content is not fair!</a></sup> <sup><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/kq/b6/ow/kqb6owq1kjxgthtvzfv1gfms9lk.png"></sup>  <sup><a href="http://www.facebook.com/glph.media/posts/319871178880650">When eight o'clock ... enough (for work)</a></sup> </blockquote></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/447002/">https://habr.com/ru/post/447002/</a></p>
