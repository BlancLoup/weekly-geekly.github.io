  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Large apartment of 20 sq.m. - with augmented reality glasses it is possible</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/16c/664/2bc/16c6642bc0241b49df7b231604a7b781.jpg" alt="image"><br>  The topic of augmented reality has been developing more and more recently.  A large number of augmented reality games have already appeared, there are a number of programs that use virtual and augmented reality for training, designing and modeling.  However, in this article I will try to fantasize and talk about the idea that came to me when I first heard about the possibilities of Google Glass in relation to our daily life. <br>  At the present time, as far as I know, there are still no applications that would implement such functionality and, perhaps, someone will be inspired by ideas that will be voiced here and will be able to bring them to life. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  So imagine.  You are on a regular football field or in the park.  There are a few more people around you, life indicators hang over them, the players themselves do not look quite like ordinary people - these can be elves, gargoyles, magicians, and in general, anyone.  You make a circular motion with your hands, a fireball forms in them, you aim and send it to your enemy.  The health indicator of the enemy goes down, goes into the red zone, but then lightning flies to you from the side, flash in the eyes, then everything goes out and eventually turns off - it's not hard to guess you were killed, you left the game. <br>  This is just one simple scenario, in fact, theoretically, augmented reality glasses can determine those around you, finish everything, display a large amount of information. <br><br>  However, this is quite a small application of such technology and I described such a game only so that you tune in to more, it seems to me, an interesting idea, which is indicated in the title of the article.  Actually, the idea is that having a room with one or two rooms (for example, a toilet, bedroom and living room) with the help of virtual reality glasses we can make an apartment with an almost unlimited number of rooms.  All we need is glasses to draw us corridors between rooms, literally leading us around.  Moreover, we can change the color and pattern of the walls, the color of the sofa, the bed, and in general, everything that comes into view of our glasses.  You can go a little further.  Maybe you know that there are robotic cubes (M-Blocks), which, changing the center of gravity, can move, be placed on top of each other, etc.  10-12 such ottomans will be enough for us, interacting with augmented reality glasses, to automatically change the location, shape and purpose of upholstered furniture.  Say "sofa", the cubes transformed into a sofa, you wanted to sleep, walked along the virtual corridor, entered the doorway, you are already in the bedroom and in front of you a bed.  At the same time, you did not leave the room, made a small circle around it, but already in a completely different room. <br>  You don‚Äôt even need windows to do this - the glasses themselves can draw a window on the wall, and this can be a cloudless sky before sunset or the sea coast ... <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/1da/73f/561/1da73f561d450ff859b91d9eb3dd4f29.jpg" alt="image"><br>  Readers may have a question - and, actually, why is all this necessary?  Why do we need such a small room, and even without windows?  And finally, why are there several rooms, people live in one-room apartments and do not complain. <br>  The answers to these questions are.  Let's start with the fact that the population of the planet is increasing, at the same time, the place suitable for life does not become much more.  I will say more, we are in search of new places to live on other planets.  Accordingly, it is quite possible that in the future there will come a time when, as in the film The Fifth Element, people will live in small rooms in which they don‚Äôt really turn around.  Psychologists have proven that cramped living conditions adversely affect our well-being, mood, and health.  It is here that such an expansion of space is useful - considering that a person is getting used to everything, it seems to me that future people can get used to this perception of space quickly. <br>  The second aspect associated with overpopulation.  In case we have to live somewhere with conditions similar to conditions on Mars (who knows, maybe we will not have time to find other options), most of life will be ‚Äúunder the dome‚Äù, and perhaps in rather cramped conditions.  So that the first missions sent to remote planets could feel comfortable, augmented reality glasses will help brighten up the time spent there.  Especially on Mars, playing Star Wars, fighting with Jedi swords, is much more interesting than on Earth. </div>
