The one-day festival will combine interesting lectures, question and answer zones, master classes and a small exhibition of interesting gadgets. <br><br>  That's right!  Day of Russian science and this is not a typo.  We know that February is far behind, but who doesn't love holidays?  In the USSR, the Day of Science was celebrated on the third Sunday of April.  After the holiday, we will gather at the Mail.Ru Group office to try to find answers to the questions of life, the universe and in general.

      The main goal of Set Up is the popularization of science in its various manifestations.  Even the most difficult things can be told in a simple and understandable language.  And we hope that the presentations of our speakers will be of interest to all guests of the festival. <a name="habracut"></a><br><br><h4>  <b>Atrium zone</b> </h4><br>  <b>12:00 - 12:10 Opening</b> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/df8/acf/605/df8acf605dcb43b08366d373e0b5e5a9.jpg" align="left">  <b>12:10 - 12:40 Mikhail Batin, Lecture "Strategy of Victory over Aging"</b> <br>  Together with Mikhail Batin, we will understand what transhumanism is and why we are not ashamed to admit to being involved in it either to ourselves or to the public.  Unless, of course, you're the one. <br><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/e11/cd1/e3d/e11cd1e3d21b4b8482923c14d186b2e7.jpg" align="left">  <b>12:45 - 13:15 Alexey Vodovozov, Lecture "Pseudodiagnostics"</b> <br>  Diagnostic capabilities in medicine have made a huge leap forward.  In order to understand the basics of a particular technique, sometimes knowledge is required not only in biology or physiology, but also in various fields of physics or chemistry.  This is used by a fairly large layer of charlatans who, behind pseudo-phrases and medical entourage, conceal even an advanced, but a real deception.  Which has its own, quite clear signs. <br><br>  <b>13:15 - 13:25 Break</b> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/f2c/a55/1a6/f2ca551a63a84d86b61b8c15cd3fe43c.jpg" align="left">  <b>13:25 - 13:55 George Shakhgildyan, lecture ‚ÄúLet's keep information in glass!‚Äù</b> <br>  Humanity has been looking through glass for more than three thousand years, but what do we see behind it?  What kind of material is it, where is it from and for what?  Windows in our apartment or bone implants, phone screens, bottles, or maybe storage media that can survive the apocalypse? <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/d57/1db/1d2/d571db1d2c534cbd9f9e1b8cdb9f7775.jpg" align="left">  <b>14:00 - 14:30 Evgeny Pelevin, lecture ‚ÄúHow to photograph science and make everyone hate yourself‚Äù</b> <br>  Many people associate scientific photography with images of the microworld taken with a tunneling microscope;  distant stars captured not without the participation of the Hubble telescope;  or simply with photos of rare birds, animals, microbes and viruses, obtained with the help of microscopes, macro and telephoto lenses.  But, in fact, the most important thing in science often remains behind the scenes.  The graduate of the Physics and Technology Institute and the photographer of the MIPT press service Yevgeny Pelevin will talk about science photography in the broader sense of the term.  At the lecture, we will also try to understand why it is so important to develop photography in Russian laboratories, and find out what needs to be taken so that the studies become known and recognizable not only in scientific circles. <br><br>  <b>14:30 - 15:00 Break</b> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/78a/461/98c/78a46198ce4e4e7eb47bee4ad31d5255.jpg" align="left">  <b>15:00 - 15:30 Stanislav Drobyshevsky, lecture ‚ÄúThe Measure of All Things: Your Own Body as a Reference Point‚Äù</b> <br>  The human body at all times served as a universal measure.  Span, elbow, step - they are easy and simple to measure anything.  However, the body of people is different.  How does our appearance affect our perception?  Do all people equally see and appreciate other people?  Will the concept of "big" equal to the pygmy and the giant?  What hair is considered black?  Whose beard is thicker?  This and many other things in the lecture. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/f29/604/3b3/f296043b3bcb4e578848ac945cfcd8f8.jpg" align="left">  <b>15:35 - 16:05 Vasily Klyucharyov, the lecture "Face - as a scientific detective story"</b> <br>  The face of man is one of the biggest mysteries for modern science.  The lecture is devoted to the peculiarities of the perception of faces, their amazing properties that radically distinguish faces from all objects around us.  Is it possible for a politician to predict by face whether he will win the election or not?  What faces do we find attractive and why?  What is the unique response of our brain to the face?  Does our attractiveness affect our income? <br><br>  <b>16:05 - 16:15 Break</b> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/bf7/57c/6f6/bf757c6f629c455fbb3f985d5d3811e6.jpg" align="left">  <b>16:15 - 16:45 Alisa Kuznetsova, lecture ‚ÄúHow to convince and dissuade yourself that you are psychic‚Äù</b> <br>  What kind of thinking errors help to believe that you have paranormal abilities?

The horizons of the possibilities of their use do not cease to excite the imagination of the leading researchers and futurologists of the world.  Doctors practitioners have already adopted new treatment methods in order to save the most difficult patients.

According to international forecasts, the 20-30s.  The 21st century is our foreseeable future, when this problem moves from the geopolitical phase to the pragmatic stage.  What does the ocean store?  What can he give us?  And what should a person do to prevent a catastrophe and save the Ocean for posterity? <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/445/79e/b5c/44579eb5c6e241bb9e45b336fa2a0c53.jpg" align="left">  <b>18:15 - 18:45 Alexander Parchin, lecture ‚ÄúWhat is aging and how to stop it‚Äù</b> <br>  With each year of life, the probability of dying in humans increases, we age.  But this is not a universal rule, a fundamentally insurmountable law of nature.  Some organisms, such as the hydra or the naked digger, have mortality that is almost independent of age - their aging is negligible.  The study of these and other long-lived organisms sheds light on the fundamental mechanisms of aging, revealing therapeutic approaches to slowing aging and prolonging life.  We will talk about what modern theories of aging exist, what scientific research is being conducted in this area and what practical results have been achieved. <br><br>  <b>18:45 - 19:00 Completion: awarding the winners</b> <br><br><h4>  <b>Cinema area</b> </h4><br>  12:00 - 12:10 Opening <br>  12:10 - 12:45 Lecture by the publishing house ‚ÄúThe Right Games‚Äù: ‚ÄúWhat are scientific games?‚Äù <br>  13:00 - 13:30 Mikhail Batin, answers to questions <br>  13:35 - 14:00 Alexey Vodovozov, answers to questions <br>  14:05 - 14:30 George Shahgildyan, answers to questions <br>  14:30 - 15:00 Break 30 minutes <br>  15:00 - 15:30 Evgeny Pelevin, answers to questions <br>  15:35 - 16:00 Stanislav Drobyshevsky, answers to questions <br>  16:05 - 16:30 Vasily Klyucharyov, answers to questions <br>  5:00 pm - 5:25 pm Alisa Kuznetsova, answers to questions <br>  17:30 - 17:55 Roman Deyev, answers to questions <br>  18:00 - 18:25 Nikolay Shabalin, answers to questions <br>  18:45 - 19:10 Alexander Parchin, answers to questions <br><br>  Information partners of the lecture hall: the popular science video blog <a href="http://sci-one.tv/">Sci-One</a> and the <a href="http://vertdider.com/">Vert Dider</a> translation and sound <a href="http://vertdider.com/">studio</a> . <br><br>  <b>Beginning:</b> 12:00. <br>  <b>Address:</b> Mail.Ru Group office, Leningradsky Prospect 39, p 79 (Metro Aeroport metro station). <br><br>  To participate in the festival must be pre- <a href="https://corp.mail.ru/ru/social/login/mailitauth/%3Fnext%3D/ru/it/event/registration/202/">registered</a> . <br><br>  Watch the video, as it was last time: <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/AWCBXZSU1-M%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=25657,15700021,15700186,15700191,15700248,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhhkAxEjSjHs1kDPGIkNemOL9fk0XQ" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/392389/">https://habr.com/ru/post/392389/</a></p>
