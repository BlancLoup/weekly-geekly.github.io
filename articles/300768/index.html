Over the quarter, the market grew by 18%, the <a href="http://www.akarussia.ru/">ACAR</a> concluded. <br><br>  ‚ÄúThe total volume of advertising budgets in advertising media minus VAT amounted to over 75 billion rubles, which is 18% more than in the same period of the previous year.  With the exception of the press segment, all other segments of the advertising market showed an increase to the indicators of the first quarter of 2015, ‚Äùsaid the AKAR.

      The volume of advertising on television grew by 19% to 35.7-36.2 billion rubles, this is the largest segment. <a name="habracut"></a>  The radio market grew by 12% to 2.7-2.9 billion rubles.  The segment of online advertising grew by 31% to 23.7 billion rubles. But the data on online advertising are preliminary, stipulated by AKAR.  This is due to the schedule of publication of reports of Russian Internet companies.  The outdoor advertising market amounted to 7.5-7.8 billion rubles, notes the AKAR. <br><br>  Internet advertising remains the main driver of the Russian advertising market.  Internet advertising has now firmly occupied one third of all media advertising on the Russian market. <br><br>  Elena Belova, CEO of Havas Media, commented on the results of the research to Sostav.ru: <br><blockquote>  The main contribution, of course, makes "context".  For small businesses, this is the main media that leads the audience, their budgets make up a very large part of this type of media communication, but the share of contextual advertising is growing in the budgets of large advertisers. <br><br>  The growth rate of display advertising is modest.  This segment is growing mainly due to the video and mobile advertising segments, as well as due to the digital media opportunities for quality targeting of the target audience. <br>  The only segment of the advertising market that showed a decline was the segment of advertising in the print media.  It decreased by 14% to 4.2-4.4 billion rubles. </blockquote><br>  In January-March last year, the market reduced volumes in rubles by 17%, and if we exclude contextual advertising, the fall in various media then averaged 25-30%, <a href="http://www.sostav.ru/publication/reklamnyj-rynok-rossii-itogi-i-kvartala-2016-22195.html">writes</a> Sostav.ru.  Despite the high growth rates in the first quarter of 2016, the Russian advertising market has not yet reached the level of the first quarter of 2014, when the market volume in the first three months of the year was 77 billion rubles. <br><br>  ‚ÄúThe main reason for the growth in Q1 is the effect of a low base.  In the first months of 2015, the demand for advertising dropped sharply.  Against the backdrop of the collapse of the ruble exchange rate and economic uncertainty, advertisers have taken a cautious stance and reduced the volume of purchases.  The high demand of the beginning of 2016 can be attributed to the partial transfer of high demand from Q3 to Q4 2015 to the beginning of 2016. Many advertisers at the end of last year faced an inventory deficit and prolonged the campaign to the beginning of 2016, ‚Äùsays Alexey Spiridonov, in an interview with Sostav.ru. Director of Communications Code Of Trade. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/300768/">https://habr.com/ru/post/300768/</a></p>
