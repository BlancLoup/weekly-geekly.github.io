All four digital cameras that have consistently appeared in me since 2002 are middle-class soap dishes.  Therefore, ‚Äúadvanced amateurs‚Äù, as well as semi-pro and professional photographers, read this post is contraindicated. <br><br>  In addition, there will be nothing about unpacking here, and sample samples of photos are not planned (the latter would just be ashamed to brag - see the first paragraph).  All this can be seen on specialized sites and specialized reports.  From myself I can only say one thing - Sony NEX-5 makes images of radically better quality than what I could get earlier (in general, it is not surprising - the APS-C matrix is ‚Äã‚Äãa little bit more than what it costs in compacts) . <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/504/f6a/73f/504f6a73fb95921461fd1e79ada7e6b6.jpg" alt="image">

      To share the same in this post, I would like to feel the use of - what you like, what is missing.  I, as a person who first bought a good digital device.  It is for me and those like me who are designed primarily Sony NEX-5 (further traffic). <br><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  So, a little background.  I have long planned to "move" on something decent.  Over the past few months I have revised the Canon S90, Panasonic LX3, Ricoh GX200, Panasonic GF-1, Olympus Pen E-P1.  The main requirement is compactness (provided, of course, the most decent with the most compact images).  Each of the surveyed cameras did not fit for their subjective reasons.  Various reasons. <br><br>  As a result, an online store courier brought a box with Sony NEX-5D (D is a kit with two lenses - 16 mm F2.8 and a standard zoom 18-55 mm F 3.5-5.6). <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/516/f08/829/516f08829525a293eb871f4a89b32277.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  The first thing that did not like it.  One of the lenses is already on the "carcass."  Accordingly, the kit does not have a cover that covers the lens mount on the device, or a second back cover.  It turns out that one of the lenses must be permanently attached to the body. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/5fb/dbd/eb2/5fbdbdeb2011fe897d8438c0f950b43e.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  In addition, the attachment of a removable lens cover is missing as a class.  But the device is intended primarily for people who do not have experience in handling such caps ... No, I found a special Sonevsky pocket on eBay that can be fastened to a belt.  However, I would like this pocket to appear, at least, in the company's online store.  Desirable until the moment when I lose the cover. <br><br>  The second.  Included is a belt around the neck, but there is no loop on the wrist.  And the latter is necessary - the most comfortable position for a walk with the device - to hold it by the ledge with your right hand.  By the way, it is really convenient - corrugated plastic is present in all necessary places - nothing slides. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/f84/4f1/dd3/f844f1dd359cc8fe1b471ee964a3d799.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Third.  Handbag.  There are no original covers in Russia yet.  If someone tells you that the Sony HX-1 case fits, don't believe it.  I tried to stuff the device into it.  Do not climb.  At least in the new one.  The only thing that managed to pick up more or less comfortable and more or less in size - LowePro Edit 110. A beautiful leather case in the booklet out of the box and lots on eBay looks great.  But Sony doesn't have one either. <br><br>  However, honestly, this is all the tar that I can pour on the machine.  Everything else is honey. <br><br>  First, all the buttons are in place.  Management is intuitive.  For teapots, a developed system of prompts is made (if it offends someone, the prompts can be easily turned off in the menu).  In principle, I was completely used to management in a day. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/c88/e02/abc/c88e02abc3e0ec1853cac496bab67e48.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  The second.  The camera is really comfortable to hold.  The option with a fixed lens is ideal for the right hand.  The left hand is not needed.  The zoom lens, of course, over-pulls - but, when using it, you cannot do without a second hand in any case. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/eb7/a1e/506/eb7a1e506af03731a15474dc6f7f3d11.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Dimensions, in general, very different ... <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/882/cf2/43a/882cf243add88e8a935fceb9a3d8a2d5.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Third.  The screen is very good quality with a decent resolution.  Turning up and down.  In the closed position is fixed by a magnet.  All that may be needed is visible on the screen. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/comment_images/378/9f4/f3b/3789f4f3bff5783d3351805b30379500.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  In addition, I immediately bought a protective transparent cover on the screen - I do not think that I would have a desire to remove it;  just do not see the point.  Although, I would not say that even without a lid, the screen looks flimsy. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/35a/764/c90/35a764c902273ea41858626a2ba6f595.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Fourth.  Already, you can find a pair of converters that are mounted on the "pancake" - "fisheye" and wide.  In addition, an adapter ring has already been announced in the online store, with which you can use almost any Sony / Minolta lenses. <br><br>  In principle, you can continue.  And about energy saving, and about viewing on the screen / removing excess, and about the video ... Everything is done with the mind. <br><br>  Yes, I remembered another bad luck.  RAW-files are not clear for ACDSee Photo Manager 2009 and for Corel PaintShop Photo Pro X3 - I had to install a special program from the complete disk.  I wonder how often I will use this program? <br><br>  The total mass of the device (with lens, battery, card) is quite tolerable even for a long walk. <br><br>  This is what happens with the "pancake": <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/23f/31d/c16/23f31dc16abca9161ac7dabd5def4c55.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  and here - with the whale "zoom": <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/98c/7e0/847/98c7e0847ecc5b86dba64a6ab206c119.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  In August, they also promise a superzoom of 18-200, but I‚Äôm not very sure that I will buy it - I‚Äôll rather take the adapter ring and telephoto from the ‚Äúadult‚Äù Sonya. <br><br>  And with a battery, everything is standard for Sony cameras.  Charging with a standard charge is not fast, however, I believe, on the day of active use it should be enough "for the eyes."  Just like 8 gigabyte cards (I didn‚Äôt take it anymore - I don‚Äôt see much sense).  By the way, MS Duo Pro or SD - the device does not matter. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/d04/27c/a2e/d0427ca2ea2728895bb8dd654c2325ee.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  In general, the summary is very simple.  Sony has made a device for those who are ripe for the transition from the category of "amateur" to the category of "advanced amateur."  And this device turned out.  Sony NEX-5 provokes pressing the shutter button - with a forty-minute walk I brought about 100 frames.  With an ordinary soap box, there would be about the same number of plots, but there are hardly more than a dozen frames. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/97570/">https://habr.com/ru/post/97570/</a></p>
