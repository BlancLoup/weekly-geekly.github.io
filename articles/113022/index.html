This is my first post, so a few words about myself. <br>  I study at MGUPI, which is important in the specialty ‚ÄúSoftware of computing equipment and automated systems‚Äù, so I welcome, colleagues! <br>  I am also a Microsoft Student Partner. <br>  I would like to tell you about the impressions of an interesting event that Microsoft has prepared for students. <br><br>  Saturday, January 29th, the most active and advanced students spent a busy and exciting day at the Microsoft office.  Attracted all the so-called programmer-entrepreneurial fees Imagine Cup. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/ad5/952/cf2/ad5952cf2bedc60451105a3fb5f9eb37.jpg" alt="image">

    <a name="habracut"></a><br>  Imagine Cup is an annual international student competition held in a variety of categories.  On the one hand, the competition provides students with the opportunity to realize their ideas in various fields, and on the other, it facilitates communication and exchange of experience between students from around the world. <br><br>  As a rule, it is not always so easy to find ‚Äúyour‚Äù team or ‚Äúyour‚Äù idea, and the potential invites you to fight.  One way or another, you should not retreat! <br><br>  The participants of the event, in the first part of the day, were invited to break up into random teams (by numbers issued at registration), and in 20 minutes to come up with a solution to improve the performance of a global problem using modern technologies.  So teams consisting of more strangers, in a short period of time presented very unexpected, interesting, sometimes extraordinary options. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/e72/11c/a4e/e7211ca4e38a4429c099fe46685f4ff1.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  The second part of the day was spent on the independent formation of the team.  Many were able to voice their ideas, to search for like-minded people, some thought about the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãa formed team, there were also those who were fully armed, with a team and an idea.  For all the action was given 3 hours, during which it was necessary to wrap the idea in the appropriate shell.  Namely: to formulate correctly the very meaning of the idea, identify its usefulness, consider the most correct means for solving the problem, and, subsequently, present your project through a presentation and, possibly, a prototype of the project. <br><br>  What is interesting, in my case, the team appeared faster ideas.  But this did not stop us, and a completely different spectrum of potential ideas came into my head.  Thinking about everyday and vital, an idea about an interactive map of minibuses suddenly appeared.  Why not keep track of exactly where the transport is located, when it will arrive and what is important, how many empty seats.  First of all, we thought about how to justify the psychological factor of human expectation.  When a person knows, owns information, and it turns out to be truthful, then this is a more advantageous situation than when schedules do not justify their purpose.  And we called it all faseBus. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/a8a/afa/7ef/a8aafa7ef597eb2ce30a30a58313f28f.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/a5e/965/6bf/a5e9656bf5607ac0e77e6bbe01b1f3ae.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Five projects were put up for judging, aimed at solving completely different problems.  There were touched the subject of travel;  ideas on how to make the city safer;  options for mutually beneficial use in the daily life of cars;  methods of coping with the long-term expectations of ground transportation and even a project to develop children through origami. <br>  Origami was the very extraordinary idea, thought out by students of the MAI, which stood out against the background of others.  This is unexpected, interesting, and can not remain unnoticed!  They became the deserved winners of the day. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/7ca/0eb/8b9/7ca0eb8b9ec84d158a9e0ba25504362c.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Speaking of the judges.  Among the small circle of judges was also Ustyuzhanin, the head of the team at the ImagineCup 2005, as well as the judge of international finals.  A person with such experience of refereeing gave really the most relevant and useful advice.  For which he special thanks from all participants of the event. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/ebd/826/526/ebd826526f094931963f405db6c78f04.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Throughout the day, it was possible to consult with experts, speak out on the twitter feed, which was broadcast on the screens, and just have a good time.  In addition, the public was able to find out in what other events you can try to show your strength.  This topic was revealed by Maria Adamyan from the business incubator of the Higher School of Economics, telling about business events in the life of students. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/74b/c2f/ce4/74bc2fce44bb8cfc9ed54216fb4b961a.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Everyone could feel for himself that he would come up with sketches of ideas, unite with strangers with one goal and achieve progress, realistically, even within one day.  Perhaps this event will help students decide to break into the world of IT-technology, not to be afraid to develop their ideas and not lose their time. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/113022/">https://habr.com/ru/post/113022/</a></p>
