      <b>Charger.</b>  It is not clear why the kit only charges from the cigarette lighter.  Yes, it will be the main one, in case the navigator is planned to be used only for its intended purpose.  If, however, to use the multimedia capabilities of the player, it would be worthwhile to provide for stationary charging.  ‚ÄúThere is a cable!‚Äù You will say.  Yes, there is a cable, but, as a rule, it takes longer to charge from a USB device than from a normal charge, and not everyone has a USB hub.  In general, the kit is sufficient, but not redundant. <br><br>  <b>Sync cable</b>  Completely standard mini USB to USB cable. <br><br>  <b>Stylus.</b>  Plastic pen, standard for a number of similar devices - communicators and PDAs. <br>  Looking ahead, I will say about the stylus and design feature Lexand si-365.  In an effort to make the design of the device close to the IPhone, the developers have not provided in the body of the groove for the stylus.  At first glance - this is a minus.  On the other hand, the stylus in the device will hardly be used.  I found him 2 applications - screen calibration, which needs to be done 1 time, and the device cuts.  How often do you rezet navigator?  For a week of testing, he never hung up with me.  So the second function of the stylus is also unlikely to be relevant.  It can be put in a bag for carrying the navigator and left in the glove compartment of the car for ‚Äúany fireman‚Äù.  The navigator interface allows you to control it with your fingers, so I suggest considering the presence of the stylus in the kit as a nice bonus and a tribute to the memory of the old PDA kits. <br><br>  With <b>a memory card</b> and an adapter, everything seems to be clear, the usual Transcend card. <br><br>  My favorite element of the kit is a <b>car mount</b> .  Frankly the weakest element.  Unfortunately, I was not able to achieve reliable attachment to the glass of the car. <br>  The reason for this is not the most reliable principle of attachment - the vacuum suction cup should be attached to the glass with the help of a mechanism when pressing the lever.  It is this lever that is the weakest link in the structure.  When shaking, the suction device comes off and falls down along with the mount and the navigator.  It is necessary either to provide some kind of pillow to soften the falls, or to mount the navigator together with the bracket in a different way, to the ventilation grille, for example.  For obvious reasons, I did not finish the test suite, I leave it to the discretion of the device users.  In principle, nothing complicated should be.  I will make a reservation, the low temperature (cold glass) could affect the reliability of fastening, but the fastening mechanism itself still raises censures. <br><br>  I have already written <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/soft/83682/">Boomburum</a> in some detail about the navigation of <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/soft/83682/">Progorod</a> , I‚Äôll just add a few words from myself. <br>  The program is pleasant, if you compare it with Navitel, which is the most familiar to me, then in Progorod all settings have less nesting levels, which speeds up the process of laying a route.  However, the interface does not seem overloaded.  Of course, on a larger screen everything would have looked even better, which is taken into account in older Lexand models. <br><br>  <b>Several screenshots of the interface "Progorod" `</b> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/2b4/efc/1a1/2b4efc1a1cb2b7b71dc283ee63081e2a.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/43b/6b0/312/43b6b0312fb67a4e9be7627aaaedb654.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/a7b/296/8df/a7b2968df908183fd5085dacb6b4a09d.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/7f3/110/a31/7f3110a3107d2aa39a53f2e7abc09525.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  With reference to this particular device, I will say one thing - the GPS module in it is more sensitive than in my Explay PN-355.  Lexand caught several satellites even while indoors (2nd floor of a 9-storey brick house).  In turn, Explay in the same room did not find one. <br><br>  <b>Appearance of the device:</b> <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/53a/ddd/5b0/53addd5b013f8970ca41aa106f158ab4.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><br>  Form factor a la IPhone, screen without sides.  The device itself is made quite high quality, does not creak, does not play. <br><br>  The connector for charging the device and the 2.5mm input for headphones are on the right side, they are covered with a rubber stopper, the plug does not dangle, it closes tightly.  Slightly higher at the same end - a slot for a microSD memory card.  The card is fixed tightly, protruding 1 mm from the slot, is clicked out by pressing (in the photo - the card is not fully recessed).  In general, the device traces the desire to ease the device through the use of smaller elements (connector 2.5 mm instead of the standard 3.5 mm, slot micro SD instead of SD). <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/a9c/ab1/8b3/a9cab18b3f67d6d405450b068d6f05d5.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  At the top there is a button to turn off the device. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/538/83d/22b/53883d22b156d1961b2b7bde3e661bad.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Behind - the speaker behind the grille and the eyelet for attaching the strap (not included). <br>  In general, I personally would not use this navigator as a portable player - after all, there are more convenient specialized devices for this, which do not differ much in cost.  In general, I would use the multimedia capabilities of this device only on a long journey, from boredom.  And that, if the car is not equipped with a stereo system.  The speaker is still not very loud for use on the road.  There are no volume rockers, the volume is adjusted only in the menu. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/b4f/da6/21e/b4fda621e92175d4b354f9828abbd5f3.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  <u><b>The official price since February for a device Lexand Si-365 3,990RUB.</b></u> <br><br>  Advantages and disadvantages: <br>  + compactness <br>  + support a large number of formats <br>  + powerful GPS module <br>  + smooth, licked design <br>  + Most connectors are standard (miniUSB, microSD), it is easy to pick up a cable and a new card in the event of a complete breakdown. <br>  + low cost device <br>  + declared the possibility of flashing <br>  + pre-installed software developed in Russia and designed specifically for Russia <br><br>  - (?) No stylus case <br>  - not too reliable attachment mechanism <br>  - headphone jack is not standard, you will need an adapter that is not included in the package <br>  - the screen is not too big, it requires a habit <br><br>  <b>Bottom line:</b> As we can see, the device copes with its core responsibilities quite well, and the drawbacks of the device lie in the plane of additional functions and are not the most critical for everyday use.  Great product for its price range. <br><br>  PS All photos and screenshots of the article in a larger version are available in the <a href="http://fotki.yandex.ru/users/ragnamaniac/album/73755%3Fp%3D0">album</a> . <br><br>  Thanks to <a href="http://www.lexand.ru/">Lexand</a> for providing the device for testing. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/84628/">https://habr.com/ru/post/84628/</a></p>
