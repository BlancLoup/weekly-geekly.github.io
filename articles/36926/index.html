  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Dream phone</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  A lot of time has passed (or rather, almost 2 years) from the moment when I happened to take part in a small project conducted by a well-known portal in Ukraine dedicated to mobile phones, under a rather vivid name - Mabila.Drimphon. <br><a name="habracut"></a>  The whole essence of the project was reduced to the following: from the portal members of the portal‚Äôs members who filled in the registration form, 70 people were selected who were given access to a dedicated forum where it was necessary to offer some of their most unimaginable ideas for Dreamfon‚Äôs functions during the project.  The administration stated: at the end of the project, the best creatives, who, moreover, were supposed to be chosen by the creatives themselves, will receive prizes.  Namely - for the first place - the phone, for the second - bluetooth headphones, and 3 third places - the bluetooth headset. <br>  But, to my surprise, in particular, to my (I don‚Äôt know about the others), this did not infect people with enthusiasm.  Active users of the forum could be counted on the fingers of two hands.  The administration was not on the forum, we were our own moderators, we even created a separate topic for flood.  And so for almost 5 months. <br>  In spite of everything, the flow of ideas began from the very beginning.  And we observed with curiosity how, after a while, much of our realization was received.  Let's say the possibility of recharging from phone to phone.  Perhaps the idea is doubtful, but <i>it was implemented by someone</i> .  And there were a lot of such ‚Äúcreatives.‚Äù (Well, let's say, within 10 pieces. I think for 7 active ‚Äúcreatives‚Äù this is a lot).  Or one of my personal ideas ... At the very beginning I wrote about the phone, the surface of which can vary.  A few days later, I realized the whole, as it seemed to me then, the stupidity of my own idea.  And was extremely disappointed when I stumbled on the news.  I will clarify: the project was carried out in the second half of 2006, and the news is dated August 2007. <br>  Time flowed slowly, just as money flowed from my account (then access to the forum was only possible with Opera Mini + GPRS), and the criteria for selecting the best authors remained incomprehensible.  And then the administration offered its own version: you propose an idea - you create a topic on the forum with a vote.  And all, respectively, vote for your idea, whether it is good or bad, and you receive for every positive vote 1 point in the rating.  But then there was the usual problem for some of the forum engines: voting "fell."  When creating these, it was possible to vote only 1 time, which was done, of course, by the author himself.  And besides, the rating of some authors did not grow at all, regardless of the votes. <br>  ... <br>  And 2006 was nearing its end.  The Administration appeared again on the horizon, having declared authoritatively that the project was being completed, and at the end of December the organizing and sponsoring company was going to hold a ‚Äúclosed party‚Äù for the participants and award the winners.  From this point on, all phone discussions with us faded into the background and the very fact of awarding was discussed.  And some resourceful forumians slowly hung up where they were not getting voting and manually rating themselves.  We (= others) were indignant, to which we received answers, they say, what I want, I do. <br>  ... <br>  The organizing company was the company Samsung-Ukraine.  She invited 10 people to the "party". <br>  (at the same time, the girl who called us insistently used the word <i>chat</i> in relation to our forum.).  This party was held in the Samsung brand store, which was then on Khreshchatyk.  We arrived there and the most important "creatives" - one of Nikolaev (= night in the train), the second of Chernigov (= 2-3 hours in a minibus).  The feelings after closing turned out to be contradictory, albeit with bitterness.  The most important creative person, whose authority was indisputable then, received an honestly earned phone (D900).  Also, after a small contest for the knowledge of the Samsung company and its products (as without it), he also got a second phone - the D600.  But with the other awards turned out to be more difficult.  Since the gifts were handed strictly by rating, regardless of how you receive it.  And the gift turned out to be less than stated.  2 bluetooth headsets were awarded for 2 and 3 places to those who artificially clocked their rating with empty voting ballots.  (but, after all, no one has read our forum. It's a pity it is now covered up and there is no access to its archive).  And the rest were left with fairly banal t-shirts with the Samsung logo. <br>  That's it all over.  Many ideas for a dream phone were lost, and which were not lost ‚Äî they were not implemented by the company that started it all. <br>  And DreamPhone has remained a dream. <br><br>  Ps.  I apologize for the excessive emotionality, if it is present. </div>
