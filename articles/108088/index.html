    <h4>  Prehistory </h4><br><br>  We had several projects.  We have been looking for money to launch them for a long time, and after going a very long way, we realized that the seed is not working in Russia today.  Business incubators, angel investors, investment funds - if something from this somewhere worked in Russia, it is more like an exception to the rule. <br><br>  And we came up with another way - to create s-miru-po-nitke.ru.  Rather, learn from the experience of developed countries and bring it to you.  Here everyone can talk about their project and ask for help from people.  As in a fairy tale, we help, as much as you can, and from what happens, each young startup manager will be able to do something.  And this may be enough for the idea to start living.  To live not only in the heads of their creators, but also in the heads of other people, to gain energy, transform and translate into reality. <br><br>  It is important for us that a young singer, a programmer, an artist, a financier, an oil industry worker, or someone else could start doing what he wanted. <br><br>  When the idea took shape, we put our affairs aside and set to work.  A couple of weeks, and the site is ready to open its doors to the first projects.  And we continue to work to make it easier, faster and more pleasant. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a>  And now the story itself! <habracut><br><br>  In the west, there is an economic model called croudfunding (funding by the crowd).  Its essence is very simple: <br><ul><li>  if a good idea is told to a large audience, then there will be many supporters; </li><li>  if each of them donates to the author of the idea ‚Äúhow much you don‚Äôt feel sorry for‚Äù, then it‚Äôs easy to get enough to embody this idea. </li></ul><br><br>  And despite the fact that in the West there are quite a few projects in various spheres that implement this principle in practice, we, in Russian-speaking countries, have nothing, unfortunately, not observed. <br><br>  At the same time, the audience, for example, Habrakhabra shows that we have a lot of creative people who are ready to give the world many wonderful projects, products, events: people write music, programs, collect various crazy devices, organize events, etc. <br><br>  But all this takes money.  After all, money is energy!  Often, this is not such a large sum, but it is often not so easy for the author of an idea to get it out of his pocket.  So we decided to help the same young authors as ourselves and open the platform to the C-world-by-thread to finance creative people and ambitious projects using the ‚Äúcrowd method‚Äù. <br><br>  Now we are selecting several projects with which we will begin work on finding the C-world in a row.  With them, we hope to debug the work of our site, to detect and correct the remaining shortcomings in the work of the site.  For our part, we will actively assist these projects in correctly shaping their ideas on the pages of the site, and make every effort to popularize and promote them. <br><br>  We believe that no worse than in Western countries, we can get together and support our authors at an early stage, which is so difficult to pass alone. <br><br>  <i>PS Please, do not add salt to the gloomy look of the site.</i>  <i>After a short time we will make the design pleasant and modern.</i>  <i>And we ask the representatives of the company Yandex (among those who read the article there will surely be such) to help us integrate Yandex.Money to collect donations for the benefit of the projects.</i> <i><br><br></i>  <i>The author of the topic is nayk <a href="http://geektimes.ru/users/nayk/" class="user_link">habrauser</a> , but he is completely new and he didn‚Äôt have enough karma to write even in the sandbox.</i>  <i>So, if you decide to miss, please share with him.</i> <i><br></i> <br><br>  <b>Upd1</b> : ForeverLive, famous on Habr√© for its wonderful piano improvisations, has already joined us. </habracut></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/108088/">https://habr.com/ru/post/108088/</a></p>
