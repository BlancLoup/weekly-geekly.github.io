So, are you ready?  Fine, then let's get started. </p><br><p>  <strong>ATTENTION!</strong>  <strong>The information described below is written for research purposes only and is not intended to be used for personal gain!</strong> </p><br><p>  I'll start, perhaps, with the background. </p><br><p>  Namely, since the end of 2013.  Then, as I recall, I faced the problem of finding a convenient IDE for quick and, most importantly, simple implementation of applied tasks.  I must say that at that moment I burned out to JAVA and, although I liked NetBeans, I wanted speed and ease of development (Do not forget that Java SE 6 was very slow).  In short, I wanted C / C ++.  Many of my friends then used VS 2012 and, of course, recommended it to me. <del>  with foam at the mouth </del>  supposedly the best IDE and blah blah blah.  Yeah, she weighed 15-20Gb at that time (deployed) and ate almost all of the RAM (4Gb under Windows + VS), and even with that, it was buggy shamelessly.  But I was ready to close my eyes to this, I always write the main code in Notepad ++.  But I couldn‚Äôt survive the ‚Äúdirt‚Äù in the IDE (when for the sake of the console application the program writes 100500+ lines of code - it infuriates me to this day, I‚Äôm not asking you to make a form ....) As a result, I deleted VS 2012 and forgot about it until 2017. </p><a name="habracut"></a><br><p>  But that did not change my main problem.  I still needed a convenient and nimble IDE.  And by chance I came across <del>  grandfathers </del>  <em>cyberforum</em> , where I was advised by Embarcadero RAD Studio XE 5. I downloaded, <del>  korsanlara merhaba </del>  , and launched the installer.  As a result, the program took about 40Gb of memory (TT), and it took a long time to load.  BUT!  it wasn‚Äôt buggy almost (in comparison, of course), then it was damp, and it didn‚Äôt support penguins.  However, it was simple and nimble. </p><br><p><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/69b/915/3db/69b9153db9ab8bf5215c0bc7045004f9.jpg" alt="image"></p><br><p>  Isn't it cute?  It also included Delphi.  As a result, I became attached to this IDE heart and soul.  Also loved, over time, Delphi.  She helped out with coursework more than once: when everyone plows for months over the graphical shell - I connected the Canvas and am happy as an elephant: 3 </p><br><p>  Of the minuses, one could say one thing - raw.  And the subsequent upgrade to XE 8 solved many shoals.  But it also brought new ones.  However, XE 8 was a really good environment, which is why I didn‚Äôt even remember about VS until 2016. </p><br><p>  Beginning of the End. </p><br><p>  It was a year before that (2015) that Emb.  RAD Studio XE 10, even found it on a <a href="https://habr.com/ru/company/delphi/blog/265819/">hub</a> </p><br><p>  So many hopes, so many perspectives: </p><br><p>  - C ++ 11 Clang for Windows <br>  - support for parallel compilation of C ++; <br>  - debugging iOS 64x applications; <br>  - supports iOS 8.4; <br>  - supports Android 5.1.1; <br>  - support for Android services; <br>  - Support for unit testing DUnitX for Android and iOS; <br>  - support for DirectX 12; <br>  - support for calling the WinRT API; <br>  - FireDAC support for NoSQL MongoDB database <br>  - New MultiView behavior; <br>  - New VCL components; <br>  - New components for working with Beacon; <br>  - improved mechanism of styles; <br>  - Improved GetIt library manager; <br>  - Improved IDE features; <br>  - and much more </p><br><p>  And all the pros ... well, you understand. </p><br><p>  So many stocks, so many flaws I have never seen from this company.  This is for you and the FMX curve, this is for you and the stub functions, this is for you to crash with damage to the source.  Generally brrr ... </p><br><p>  But I somehow stuck to this environment and did not hurry to refuse it.  In addition, knowing the policy of this company, I was expecting UpdatePack to fix these errors.  And did not fail, they released RAD 10.1 Berlin.  Having worked in it, I realized ... this is the beginning of the wilting of the company ... </p><br><p><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/224/fc2/9db/224fc29db76dcf5f2263a581f2438cd1.png" alt="image"></p><br><p>  And the reasons for my opinion were as follows: </p><br><ol><li>  The Creepiest Copy Design From Microsoft </li><li>  Everything became raw, even UI </li><li>  A lot of garbage when compiling </li></ol><br><p>  And if everything is clear with the first.  The company scored on its classic and modern design and began to tear everything, even VS syntax highlighting is a bad sign.  Also, okay, they would steal it qualitatively, but no - when switching to night / day modes, the windows could curl up or not be completely repainted or ... in short, a bunch of jambs and bugs.  I had never before deliberately deleted a given studio for more than a couple of days, however I did it for the first time.  And the reason is not only that they did not finish the UI, the reason is also that the old bugs were fixed well if by 25%.  It was simply impossible to work. </p><br><p>  As a result, I tried installing VS 2017 and ... didn‚Äôt take root.  Well, I do not like their studio and that's it.  I switched to Qt Creator.  Really a thing.  mingw-x64 then only appeared, as I understood it, and for me it was a salvation.  But the minus is that Qt, although it provides a convenient and high-quality installation, still then she had some problems with the speed of the IDE itself (it was corny buggy).  And so I sat on QT Creator until the release of RAD Studio 10.2 Tokyo.  Actually, many bugs were fixed, the work is really visible. </p><br><p><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/003/d09/cca/003d09ccafe721cb2d81f39cc27d91a4.jpg" alt="image"></p><br><p>  And I was even able to use it normally, not to say that everything was fine, but I‚Äôve already worked on <strong>3</strong> bites.  At that moment, I remember, the thought arose another release and everything will be super.  Carcass ... </p><br><p>  So, it's RIO time, RAD Studio 10.3 time <br>  When I put it down, I crossed my fingers like a small one, and really hoped.  But, we wish, and Embarcadero put a bolt ... First, they sort of eliminated <a href="">more than 600 errors</a> and ... broke the compilation of libraries.  Seriously.  They broke the compilation of C ++ libraries.  Okay ... I didn‚Äôt have time to recover from the shock, as they again, it turns out, broke the UI (it doesn‚Äôt work properly when changing the subject).  Well, I think well done - added git and it still works.  And no, for its work you need to install git separately ... Although, maybe that's why it works? </p><br><p>  Honestly, I was very upset by the new environment. </p><br><p>  That seems to be all, but no - they release RAD 10.3.2 RIO Architect.  I didn‚Äôt even want to install it, so I put it on a virtual machine.  And ... I really liked her.  For once, they almost didn‚Äôt add functionality, but sent developers to the new functionality <del>  smoking bamboo </del>  saw support for Linux and MacOS x64.  And this was partly the right decision, because  We have not yet planned to use linux, far from everyone has macOS, and the environment itself has become much more stable.  Yes, not without jambs, but more stable.  I even put it on the main computer. </p><br><p>  After some time, I realized that C ++ 17 is still superior to C ++ 11, and also fell in love with Boost.  I tried to switch to VS 2019. And (somehow I will write in more detail) I went.  I really liked the environment and did not really want to change it to a good, but outdated RAD 10.3.2.  As a result, its destiny became Delphi, which, as a programming language, has also become very outdated in every sense (I will write about this in one of the following articles). </p><br><p>  And now, finally, we got to the new update that I had a run in. </p><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/3tQ9KDpGsRQ" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><p>  What they added: </p><br><ol><li>  MacOS x64 </li><li>  Linux GUI </li><li> C ++ 17 <br>  I'll start, perhaps, with the latter.  Yes, they brought in the 17th standard.  BUT!  They didn‚Äôt deliver normal code completion to it.  As a result, it results in micro friezes, showing phantom errors, etc.  etc.  (I now have 16Gb RAM and core i7 Haswell).  Most likely they just didn‚Äôt have time. <br>  1) and 2) I can only say one thing - it‚Äôs very damp, but it‚Äôs even good (see above) <br>  But the bugs Delphi noticeably corrected, also FMX has become faster. <br>  And I really like all this, if not one important BUT! </li></ol><br><p>  By the time they fully switch to C ++ 17, a new standard will be released, etc.  etc.  And if they rush like this time, then everything will be raw.  And that is why they lose to the same Microsoft VS 2019 or Qt Creator.  They stupidly do not keep up with them. </p><br><p><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/69d/9ab/b17/69d9abb1737c5665bf7908e79ffeaf17.jpg" alt="image"></p><br><p>  But the worst thing, as for me, was the tightening of security in the absence of adequate prices.  If, for example, Qt and VS cost up to 10k rubles per person (we don‚Äôt take into account the organization), then Embarcadero RAD Studio, which currently loses everything in VS 2019, costs around 100k. </p><br><p>  Does this mean that the IDE is dead? </p><br><p>  I don‚Äôt know how dead, but going through far from the best of times :( </p><br><p>  Maybe I'm wrong, but apparently the IDE is lagging behind its competitors and the farther the stronger. </p><br><p>  With you was Alrott SlimRG <br>  Thank you for watching! </p><br><p>  Share your opinions in the comments ‚Üì </p></div>
