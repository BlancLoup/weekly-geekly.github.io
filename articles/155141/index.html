At first they just laughed at the photos of the device on the Internet - and now they are laughing.  See how a frail Korean girl tries to hold him with one hand: <br><br>  TTX also raised questions, the first wave of criticism - the screen. <br>  Five inches with a 4: 3 aspect ratio, the resolution is 1024x768, like the 17-inch CRT monitors popular at the time.  They scolded ‚ÄúTegra‚Äù for the lack of expandable memory and non-removable battery, the capacity of the latter ‚Äî a little more than 2,000 mA * h ‚Äî also provoked a lot of discontent, with such immodest dimensions of the ‚Äúphone‚Äù doubted its ability to ‚Äústand for night and day‚Äù.  In general, the endless stream of criticism and discontent from the sofa analysts created an appropriate mood among people. <br><br>  But what turned out to be true?

    <a name="habracut"></a><br><h4>  Screen and Form Factor </h4><br>  The Optimus Vu screen is built on the basis of the IPS-matrix of the latest generation of our own production.  Resolution - 1024x768 pixels, ‚Äúhonest‚Äù RGB-subpixels, diagonal - 5 inches. <br>  There are no problems with applications, everything is perfectly adapted to the screen resolution, but for rarely-rare cases, you can hold down the home button and get the ‚Äúclassic‚Äù Android ratio of 16 to 9 with a resolution of 1024x600, which Intel-based smartphones already have. <br><br><img src="http://www.habrastorage.com/images/432334xxx.jpg"><br><br>  There are no problems with color rendition, with viewing angles - everything is gorgeous.  The stock of brightness is quite large, in the October Moscow sun you can quite comfortably distinguish between text and icons. <br><br>  Critics immediately condemned the unusual proportions of the screen with such a diagonal, but 5 inches with a picture width of 768 dots allow you to use any convenient qwerty-keyboard in the vertical position of the smartphone with both hands at once.  The speed of typing and convenience is almost the same as on the hardware keyboards a la Nokia e72 (and its few form factor neighbors).  Plus, you can always <a href="http://yadi.sk/d/FFEF1LnR0G3YZ">put Swype</a> , if the native keyboard does not suit you with something. <br>  The ‚Äúswapping‚Äù itself is also present in the LG keyboard, but many are not satisfied with the arrangement of symbols on it and hard-to-reach numbers and punctuation. <br><br>  In the horizontal position, most sites look great, it is convenient to work with documents and mail.  Yes, the video has ‚Äústripes‚Äù, nothing can be done about it.  On the other hand, how often do you watch movies on your phone?  In addition, the useful area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe screen is the higher, the closer the proportions to the square.  Well, since it would be inconvenient to use a square smartphone, we have an option as close as possible to it for convenience. <br>  With games, by the way, problems also do not arise. <br><img src="http://www.habrastorage.com/images/2uvu.png"><br><br><img src="http://www.habrastorage.com/images/3tqt.png"><br><br><img src="http://www.habrastorage.com/images/4oro.png"><br><br><h4>  Housing </h4><br>  That's really something, and the body, lying on the couch and criticizing new developments, is very difficult to assess.  The device is made in the L-style of 2012, differs from other devices in the line only in size and capabilities.  The back ‚Äúcover‚Äù is made of textured plastic, does not slip and does not stick to hands, dust and dirt are not stuffed into the ‚Äúpattern‚Äù, and the surface itself is sufficiently scratch-resistant.  The sides - ‚Äúunder the metal‚Äù, the front panel is covered with protective glass. <br>  Simka is delivered through a special slot in the side of the device.  The slot is closed with a very reliable and tight plug.  Put and forget, as they say.  At the top is a lockable microUSB port slider, a lock button and a QuickMemo instant note button. <br>  The stiffeners are designed perfectly, the device is monolithic: no squeaks, no pushing of the screen, no ‚Äúbumpy‚Äù of elements.  Light falls are not afraid of him, and from serious ones, none of the smartphones, with the rare exception of specially protected models, are not insured. <br><br><img src="http://www.habrastorage.com/images/2ngn.png"><br><br><img src="http://www.habrastorage.com/images/5ana.png"><br><br><img src="http://www.habrastorage.com/images/4fmf.png"><br><br><h4>  Filling </h4><br>  SoC Nvidia Tegra 3, a quad-core processor with an excellent graphics core, is responsible for performance and graphics.  Most dissatisfied dealt with really not the most successful solutions in the face of the first two generations - they did not have an extended set of NEON instructions and did not cope well with playing multimedia. <br>  The third generation lacks this drawback and is a modern and energy-efficient solution with a performance margin for the year ahead. <br><br><img src="http://www.habrastorage.com/images/1knk.png"><br><br><img src="http://www.habrastorage.com/images/2uzu.png"><br><br><img src="http://www.habrastorage.com/images/3nun.png"><br><br>  The Tegra-Zone is full of toys, sharpened specifically for this SoC and having improved, compared to the version for all graphics. <br>  RAM - 1 gigabyte. <br>  Memory for storing personal files, photos, videos and music does not expand, but, fortunately, it is 32 GB (of which 26.5 GB is available to the user).  This is enough for all sorts of applications, games, a couple of HD movies, a dozen music albums and the annual photo archive of a smartphone. <br><br>  Those who find such volume insufficient are not to forget that LG Optimus Vu will have access to the <a href="http://www.lg.com/ru/cloud">LG Cloud</a> cloud service, which offers each user 50% of the registration for free for 6 months, then a small surcharge will be required for using this solution . <br><br><img src="http://www.habrastorage.com/images/qvq.png"><br><br><h4>  Camera </h4><br>  The 8 megapixel autofocus and flash module provides excellent shots, much better than those of previous generations, even the LG Optimus 4X HD.  There is no need to go far for examples of photos, you can refer to any foreign review: <a href="http://www.androidcentral.com/lg-optimus-vu-review">www.androidcentral.com/lg-optimus-vu-review</a> <br>  Yes, this is not a photo-flagship, but it is difficult to find fault with the quality - quite at the 2012 level.  We'll wait for the LG Optimus G (and for one, the Vu II, which has already appeared in Korea), and compare them a bit later. <br><br><h4>  Battery </h4><br>  2080 Milliampere-hours, built-in, without the possibility of replacing or installing an extended battery.  In moderately difficult conditions (screen at 50% brightness, with Wi-Fi, 3G and Bluetooth enabled), the smartphone lasts for about 12 hours, of which: 6 hours the screen is on, and the Internet connection is active, 1 hour of calls and a half dozen SMS.  One forty-minute series of Homeland'a (a great series, by the way), the sound of a wireless stereo headset.  Very good result. <br><br><h4>  Software </h4><br>  LG Optimus Vu immediately goes to Android 4.0 with the possibility of further updates.  Usability OS is at a high level, and the system itself perfectly digests any screen resolution.  Perhaps, the interface just lacks the ‚Äúflatness‚Äù in the settings and some other places, but otherwise the design and work with the smartphone completely repeat the situation with 4X HD - except that the number of columns and lines of icons is slightly different. <br><br><img src="http://www.habrastorage.com/images/6epe.png"><br><br><img src="http://www.habrastorage.com/images/7jgj.png"><br><br>  The device has NFC on board (and recognizes metro tickets from DefaultCity as NFC tags, if Yandex cards are not installed), supports fast profile switching via NFC keyfobs, which are included. <br><br><img src="http://www.habrastorage.com/images/8zgz.png"><br><br><img src="http://www.habrastorage.com/images/9rvr.png"><br><br>  In addition to NFC, which is now very few people will surprise, the smartphone has all the necessary wireless interfaces, so with software communication capabilities everything is OK. <br>  If you recall the "description" of the appearance, then it mentioned a separate button for notes Quick Note.  Work with them is improved compared with the rest of the 2012 devices, thanks to the large screen diagonal.  In addition, with all the notes fall into a special collection.  The smartphone itself is literally focused on use as a diary. <br><br><img src="http://www.habrastorage.com/images/6tkt.png"><br><br><img src="http://www.habrastorage.com/images/11axa.png"><br><br><img src="http://www.habrastorage.com/images/12ini.png"><br><br><img src="http://www.habrastorage.com/images/13nkn.png"><br><br><img src="http://www.habrastorage.com/images/14tzt.png"><br><br>  A separate application with notebooks was also developed. It has quite wide capabilities: great customization of both the notebooks themselves and the tools for filling them, convenient cataloging and integration into other OS elements. <br><br><img src="http://www.habrastorage.com/images/15qxq.png"><br><br><img src="http://www.habrastorage.com/images/16xvx.png"><br><br><img src="http://www.habrastorage.com/images/17eke.png"><br><br>  In general, the device is interesting for its unusual form factor, large screen and an unusually broad functionality.  Perfect for those whose main criteria when buying a smartphone are not toys and social networks, but a business goal: keeping business correspondence, using it as a diary and planner. <br><br>  For such people, Vu will be a real secret weapon, because it was created just for this. <br>  And in case of anything - maybe not secret, because the size and weight correspond.  ;) </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/155141/">https://habr.com/ru/post/155141/</a></p>
