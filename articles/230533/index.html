At the request of <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/users/csklassami/" class="user_link">Csklassami I</a> will try to tell you how with a high degree of probability to enroll in a North American university for a bachelor's degree.  I am 17 years old and I entered this year for the first time. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/197/3ad/7dd/1973ad7dd6664d0025b89609ef121648.jpg"><br><br>  I will say this: if you write articles on Habr√© or read them with great interest, and most importantly you understand the essence, then most likely you will be able to enroll.  Of course, this does not sound very likely, but the thing is: there is a different system of admission in US universities.  In the American system, in addition to the test results, the university is interested in your hobbies.  It is important for them that you could be engaged in scientific activities there, be versatile.

      For example, a quote from the official MIT website for applicants (undergraduate): <br><br>  <i>"MIT we admit people, not numbers ...".</i> <br>  <i>"It is very important to understand that at MIT we accept people, not numbers ...".</i> <br><br>  In this post, I will describe the entire admission process, from the choice of universities to the interview, based on my personal experience. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h4>  Exams and tests </h4><br>  Let's start with the fact that you need to pass all exams.  Those who are going to come next year, I advise you to start now.  In many universities, the main exam is the SAT.  This test basically tests your knowledge of English.  He also checks the basic knowledge of algebra and geometry.  It should be noted that since the exam is designed for native speakers (Americans pass the same exam upon admission) - English is difficult there, but the math is very easy.  In addition to SAT, depending on the specialty, you will also have to pass the SAT Subject Test, and most likely not one.  SAT Subject Test - this is a profile subject to choose from when passing the exam.  You can take all the exams as many times as you like.  The university will take the best result. <br><br>  Here, the most difficult thing for me was to understand why, for example, the same MIT, on equal terms, accepts the results of SAT Subject Test Math Level 1 and SAT Subject Test Math Level 2. <br><br>  Although both exams differ significantly in complexity (in the first all questions are practically arithmetic and geometry, and the second is trigonometry and stereometry) in order to get the maximum score for the first exam you can make far fewer mistakes than in the second exam. <br><br>  You can prepare for this site: <a href="http://www.sparknotes.com/testprep">www.sparknotes.com/testprep</a> <br><br>  For me personally, the format of the books presented there was inconvenient.  And the same books I found in PDF format, and then printed.  This is the most convenient form of training, in my opinion.  You can take notes and scribble directly in the book.  Actually, on the exam it will be so, no drafts are given there. <br><br>  Links to all books will make at the end of the article. <br><br>  Also, you will most likely have to pass TOEFL.  There is nothing unusual here.  Just get ready, great, if it is possible to prepare with a teacher or specials.  courses - and rent out. <br><br>  All universities specifically designate which exams you take and which balls you should count on.  Very conveniently, this data is presented on the MIT website: <a href="http://mitadmissions.org/apply/process/stats">mitadmissions.org/apply/process/stats</a> <br><br><h4>  How to send your results to universities </h4><br>  When you pass all the exams, you can send your results to 4 universities for free.  This applies to both the TOEFL and all SAT exams. <br>  If you want to send out more than 4 results, then you have to pay $ 11 for each university to which you want to send the results of your SAT exams ($ 11 includes sending the results of all SAT exams at once, which you passed; you do not need to pay for each separately) and $ 19 for each additional TOEFL Score Report.  The cost of the exams themselves, I will not consider, since it may vary depending on the place of delivery.  I can only say that in Moscow I really enjoyed taking the Anglo-American School Of Moscow.  Since I myself was not from Moscow, I came there by train from Kazan at 6 in the morning, at 7 I went to school and at 8 I wrote the exam.  He ate at the same school, there is an excellent dining room.  In the evening I went by train home.  If you live in a city where these exams are not conducted, do not be afraid to travel according to such a one-day scheme - it‚Äôs very convenient.  By the way, in one day you can take up to 3 SAT Subject Test, or simply SAT. <br>  Be careful when sending results: the university code for sending SAT tests may be different from the university code for sending TOEFL! <br><br><h4>  How to save money on admission </h4><br>  All universities upon receipt take Application Fee in the amount of $ 50 to $ 125.  You will have to pay them if you don‚Äôt get on the list of certain benefits, such as health status, for example.  Moreover, in case of refusal, this money will not be returned.  I highly recommend you participate in the My College Quick Start program from CollegeBoard (a company that conducts SAT exams).  Based on the application form you filled out and the results of the exam, she will select the university where you, as a member of the program, will not be paid Application Fee. <br><br>  In fact, it is possible and not to pay for passing exams, but when I took the exam, I did not know about it, and there was nobody to ask.  Therefore, in this matter I am not savvy. <br><br><h4>  How to choose a university </h4><br>  One of the most difficult to enroll in the United States is to choose a university.  If in Russia we know well which universities are famous for, then I did not know much about universities in America.  I did the following: I chose three top universities, which I do not need to submit.  This is Princeton University, MIT and Caltech. <br><br>  Then more interesting.  I chose two cities in which I would be interested to study safely and safely.  I chose Philadelphia and Salt Lake City. <br><br>  In each city I chose by university: Westminster College Salt Lake City and Drexel University Philadelphia.  The first is a good program in Computer Science.  And in the university studying 10% of the US Olympic team in winter sports.  Posh campus, ski resorts, in general, everything is as it should be.  In the second I was attracted by the geographical position of Philadelphia, a strong program in my specialty and the so-called Co-Op, which I will discuss separately. <br><br><h4>  Co-op </h4><br>  Each university has its own characteristics, its own programs, you should definitely pay attention to them.  For example, in Drexel University there is a program Co-Op.  Thanks to this program, students either three times or once, depending on the chosen duration of study, go to practice in companies around the world.  Moreover, they receive a salary that can be sent both to pay for tuition and to spend on personal needs. <br><br>  Here are some statistics on this program: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/ac1/272/a81/ac1272a81b63c0f901a4d7627f8a8688.jpg"><br><br>  It is very important, when entering to pay attention to such moments and programs. <br><br><h4>  Filling the Application Form </h4><br>  In each university, you will be asked to complete an Application Form, where you will need to complete information about yourself.  There will also have to write a few detailed answers to the questions posed by the university.  Take this part responsibly.  Write about all your achievements, even the smallest ones.  Show that before the university you were interested in your future specialty, tell us how you went to her and what activity you showed on your way to school.  Do not be afraid to use your sense of humor in motivational letters, the main thing here is not to overdo it, so as not to add a frivolous opinion about yourself.  Write about all the olympiads in which you participated, in general, by all means try to stand out among the applicants.  For example, when I entered MIT, I made a video about myself (however, it still did not help me, I was not accepted at MIT). <br><br>  Also, perhaps, some universities will support the Common Application system.  After registering in this system, you fill out one questionnaire, common for all universities, and answer additional questions from each university separately.  This is very convenient, since there is really a lot to fill in there.  If the university supports Common Application profiles, you will see this on their website, upon admission. <br><br><h4>  How I got burned on this system </h4><br>  Having filled in all the fields of the Common Application and answered additional questions from each university (Common Application used for admission to Princeton and Caltech), I was ready to send these questionnaires.  First of all, it was necessary to double-check everything again, and then introduce Application Fee, which I have already mentioned.  After payment, and it was December 31, the last day before the deadline, happy and satisfied went to celebrate the new year.  Already towards the end of January I wanted to know if I could add another letter of recommendation to Princeton?  To which I was briefly answered: <br><br>  <i>"We don't have any files on name."</i> <br>  <i>"In your name, we have no documents."</i> <br><br>  To say that my heart has gone away in my heels is to say nothing.  I began to urgently find out why it happened with technical support for the Common Application.  It turned out that after the payment I had to once again go to their website and confirm the dispatch again.  After that, I urgently wrote to Caltech, they did not have my documents either.  During the day, I agreed with Princeton University and they extended the deadline by one day.  I sent them my application.  Caltech was more stubborn and did not want to accept my documents for a long time.  I showed perseverance, threatened that otherwise I would get the money back from them.  As a result, during the week they officially sent me a refusal, even without assigning an interview.  From here it is important to conclude: never, leave nothing on the last day! <br><br><h4>  Interview </h4><br>  Now about how to pass the interview.  In the most prestigious universities, the interview is held in their native language.  For example, in MIT I was interviewed by Alexey Denisov, who, as I recall, graduated from the magistracy at MIT.  In Princton, I was interviewed by political scientist Boris Makarenko.  If any of them read this article now, I want to say hello to them! <br><br>  Before the interview I advise you to come up with a plan according to which you will talk about yourself, after you tell everything, you will be asked questions, again about you (not to test your knowledge), and then they will tell you about the university.  The first time is scary, and then you get used to it, and in life, I think this experience will come in handy).  Not all universities conduct interviews.  For example, Westminster and Drexel, usually they are not carried out, but I insisted.  Although they say that this has no effect on admission, I am almost sure that they pay attention to it, even though the person I interviewed in Westminster and the person who eventually sent me a letter with the results this one face.  In general, if you speak English at a good level, ask for an interview. <br><br><h4>  results </h4><br>  As a result, I entered two out of five universities.  As you already know, MIT and Caltech refused me, in May Princeton also refused me.  But then the black band ended and I was accepted into Westminster and Drexel.  To say that I was glad is to say nothing.  And when I found out that both universities cover most of my total expenses, I was delighted even more.  In the end, opted for Drexel University.  Largely due to the practice program in various companies. <br><br>  A week ago I received a visa and now I am in full swing preparing for the beginning of the school year! <br><br>  Many thanks to all who read this article to the end.  I sincerely hope that she will help someone.  If anyone is interested, I can continue to write about the learning process in the USA. <br><br><h4>  useful links </h4><br>  - Books for SAT to PDF <br>  - Math Level 2: <a href="http://papers.xtremepapers.com/SAT/SAT%2520II%2520Math.pdf">papers.xtremepapers.com/SAT/SAT%20II%20Math.pdf</a> <br>  - Physics: <a href="http://papers.xtremepapers.com/SAT/SAT%2520II%2520Physics.pdf">papers.xtremepapers.com/SAT/SAT%20II%20Physics.pdf</a> <br><br>  SAT registration site: <a href="http://www.collegeboard.org/">www.collegeboard.org</a> <br>  Common Application: <a href="https://www.commonapp.org/Login">www.commonapp.org/Login</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/230533/">https://habr.com/ru/post/230533/</a></p>
