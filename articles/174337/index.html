We are used to seeing them everywhere: on the computer, phone, wall clocks and wrist watches, and Google glasses will generally make it so that time will always be in front of your eyes.  We feel the need for time and always want to know what time it is. <br><br>  And what if you give up the time frame?  What will change?  Do you have 24 hours a day?  When this thought occurred to me, and I could not help but check it on myself.  Under the cut my story and feelings of two weeks of life without hours and without time.  <b>In short: it's worth it!</b> <a name="habracut"></a><br><br><h4>  Idea </h4><br>  It all started with the fact that I wondered, what is it, the present, biological time?  Any porridge with time zones and established schedules (for work / university / school by 8-9 in the morning) could introduce some distortions into biological rhythms familiar to man.  I was wondering what time I would go to bed and get up.  Himself, not by the hour, but by the sensations.  We can say that I am a freelancer, I have no graphics and no bosses, and I can afford such an experiment with time. <br>  I pulled out the batteries from all the wall clocks, removed the wristwatch, turned off the time on the phone (it is there, but very small and in the corner. I closed it with my finger while using the phone), turned off the time on the computer (in the date and time settings in Windows 7 instead hh: mm just entered spaces) <br>  I clearly understood that sometimes I would still have to use the watch, but I decided to keep it to a minimum.  For example, if I agreed to meet with someone in an hour, then I would not start a reminder, but a timer.  To keep track of what time I go to bed and get up, I decided to send emails to the phone myself before going to bed and after waking up.  Thus, despite the clock, I could save the time and date of action.  Looking ahead to say that the statistics are very poor, but ...

    <h4>  Experiment </h4><br>  The first day.  Heavy.  I constantly look at my wrist, then at the wall in search of a watch.  I remember about the experiment.  There is no urgent need for time, but the habit takes its toll.  I am telling friends about the experiment, at the same time I ask you not to tell me the time.  Everyone is interested. <br>  <i>I usually went to bed somewhere around one in the morning, and I might have wanted to sleep much earlier, but I looked at my watch and realized that it was still early.</i>  Now went to bed without knowing how much time it was.  Just wanted to sleep. <br>  <i>The same story with the awakening.</i>  <i>If I woke up at 9-10 am, then looking at the clock I realized that I could sleep more.</i>  Now, waking up in the morning, I could not determine how much time, and got up immediately after waking up. <br><br>  Of course, sometimes I found out the time.  In total, in the first week I learned the time 7-8 times (mostly by chance).  These accidents were due to the fact that with the arrival of my email I saw the time of his arrival (and it just came).  This could not be disabled, but in the Skype settings, the time is turned off.  Sometimes it was necessary to find out the time on purpose - without this, some things simply did not <br><br>  I found an interesting point: I often had it that when I looked at my watch and saw time, say, 17:00, I was fascinated by the thought that half a day had passed, and I really didn‚Äôt do anything.  I think I'm not alone in such thoughts.  So, this feeling is gone.  He is no more.  I do not know what time it is, and I just work. <br>  When I started this experiment, my productivity was very low during the last week.  Literally from the first day everything changed.  Productivity and mood in general have improved significantly.  Strange as it may seem, but <a href="http://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%259F%25D1%2580%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BA%25D1%2580%25D0%25B0%25D1%2581%25D1%2582%25D0%25B8%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B0%25D1%2586%25D0%25B8%25D1%258F">procrastination is</a> almost gone to ‚Äúno‚Äù - I think this is the most effective way. <br><br>  I lead a healthy lifestyle, exercise regularly and eat right.  Because of the time, there were some psychological frames, such as: not eating before bed (in my case after 10-11 pm) or not training after 8 pm.  Now this is not.  I just do everything the way I want and feel. <br><br><h4>  Statistics </h4><br>  Unfortunately, the statistics showed little.  When I started the experiment, I thought that I would lay out on Habr√© a schedule of when I fell asleep and woke up (the original purpose of the experiment was to determine the biological time).  But no.  Sometimes I just forgot to send statistics, or just really wanted to sleep.  There are gaps in a couple of days, and in general, my schedule floats.  In general, from what is, I can say <b>that 24 hours a day is enough for me</b> .  I sleep an average of 8.5-9 hours and stay awake for 15-15.5 hours.  I can fall asleep at 11 pm, I can at 3 o'clock in the morning.  I repeat, the schedule jumps, but the average rise time is 10-10: 30 am, and the end time is at one in the morning. <br><br><h4>  findings </h4><br>  It's been a little over two weeks.  Put on the clock and ... took them off.  I do not want.  I really liked my experiment, which most likely will now remain my habit.  Now I can quite afford to look at my watch, but I do it not out of habit, but only if necessary.  If you have the opportunity to try to give up time, do it.  Try it.  I can not describe all my feelings, but I became free.  I had more time for different things, and to tell others that I ‚Äúdo not have time‚Äù became much less. <br><br>  PP My time zone is UTC + 04: 00 (ala Moscow) <br>  PSS If someone decides to repeat the experiment, I will ask to unsubscribe about the results in the comments.  Very interesting what will change for you </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/174337/">https://habr.com/ru/post/174337/</a></p>
