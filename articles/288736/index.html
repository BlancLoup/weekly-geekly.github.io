  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Provincial blogger</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Once I thought that they were fired for blogs only abroad, in advanced bourgeois, but quite recently I had to face it myself.  And where?  You will not believe.  The very fact: ‚Äúgene.  the director ‚Äúasked‚Äù to write a statement because of the blog entry ‚Äùis quite trivial and does not surprise anyone (at Habr√© for sure), another is surprising: where it happened.  In a city with a population of thirty thousand people, hundreds of kilometers from civilization "inside the Moscow Ring Road + Peter" (the answer to the question: is there life there).  This, I think, will surprise even the masters.  Now more: <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  As I have already said, our city is small, in terms of communications backward to the impossibility (we are still getting rid of the dialup), and I worked at one of the local (as the city-forming enterprises like to say here).  The post was called "head of IT".  In practice: the admin (s), the programmer, the technician and the telephonist (and I, of them, were the youngest in age, so there wasn‚Äôt even a word about any initial skills).  Worked for two years and eight months.  I've already got used to everything (how do you think working at a factory, where 75% of the state is over 45).  He was even friends with many.  There was a fairly narrow circle there around the reception center and the directorate, which somehow didn‚Äôt work out with them. <br><br>  So, the machine engineer day has come.  I come home, I see our local newspaper on the table, an article about our ‚Äúwonderful‚Äù factory, how everything works well there, how everything develops dynamically, in short, I called it all ‚Äúcaramel snot‚Äù.  Without thinking twice, I sat at the computer, scanned the article, opened our local forum, inserted it there and made a few comments in places that I did not like (in green, so that they did not confuse with the original).  If the comments ask for the text of the article, I will give a link without any problems.  Well, in the blog duplicated.

      The next day (just a coincidence), he ached and took sick leave (a scary word).  After a week I go to work, everyone looks askance at me, even the guards at the checkpoint.  After dinner, they call to the CEO (he couldn‚Äôt call himself already, that‚Äôs how he got angry).  He says write a statement, do not cope with their duties.  I was surprised, of course, but I didn‚Äôt bother to ask too much (they still paid little).  Well, I say, I will write.  I go out, in the reception all stare at me.  I ask the guys from the department what's the matter.  And they give me an otkserokopirovannoe printout of the text of the article with my comments.  Like, the whole plant read, even in the shops.  Everyone said they really liked it.  But, as it turned out, not everyone. <br><br>  I think this is still a great injustice.  Maybe this is normal, but then I don‚Äôt understand what kind of freedoms they say around.  And the fact that it happened 500 km from Moscow, in the village, practically, also leads to sad reflections.  Interesting is the opinion of habrazhiteli about this.  If someone wants to see the text of the article itself, write in the comments, I will put the link.  Well, or if you need to call everything by its proper name: the city, enterprises, people, yourself - this is also not a problem, but is it necessary?  God forbid, think that advertising. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/288736/">https://habr.com/ru/post/288736/</a></p>
