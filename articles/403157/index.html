These are projectors, picoprojectors, nozzles for telephones with projectors and even tablets with built-in miniature projecting modules.  But for a long time no one could offer a universal device for the whole family.  An ordinary projector is rather cumbersome, in many cases a connection to a laptop is required, since not all devices work with external media.  In addition, you need to connect to a regular electrical outlet. <br><br>  Not so long ago in Russia, a device that can be called a mini-cinema.  In the office for presentations it can hardly be used, but in the family, at home - completely.  And that's why. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/bb3/aef/af2/bb3aefaf2d3b4531ac03d73f546467d9.jpg">

    <h3>  A bit of background </h3><br>  The creator of <a href="https://cinemood.com/">CINEMOOD</a> is businessman Mikhail Bukhovtsev, back in 2014 he decided to make a mini-cinema for a Russian user.  It was immediately decided to load content into the device‚Äôs memory so that customers would not have to scour the Internet in search of suitable materials.  Well, since the device was supposed to be "home", the main content was made by cartoons.  To do this, ‚ÄúSoyuzmultfilm‚Äù acquired the rights to show 50 cartoons (now it‚Äôs about 500 cartoons from 30 studios). <br><br>  The devices were made (the first version was called Multikubik) in China, their sales were more or less active.  But this did not last long - until December 2014. Then the supplier sent more than a thousand copies with defective optical modules.  But as the saying goes: "Everything that does not kill makes us stronger."  Therefore, the domestic company began to develop their own. <br><br>  A device circuit was developed from scratch, and the resulting devices were disassembled and reassembled.  Moreover, the optical module was developed in conjunction with Texas Instruments.  In addition, the mini-cinema (only now called CINEMOOD Storyteller) received a motorized focus and a passive cooling system.  The new system was released on Indigegogo, where it <a href="https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/cinemood-storyteller-your-kid-s-first-home-cinema-family-education--5-old">collected</a> $ 163,718.  That was enough for the launch of mass production of the device.  CINEMOOD Storyteller was able to enter the international market, although the first version was sold only in Russia. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/70d/17f/990/70d17f9903f44d4f840b0a7114a923e6.jpg"><br><br>  Collect the device again began in China, but with a different partner.  The device, among other things, equipped with WiFi, which allowed to get rid of the wires.  Thanks to the wireless connection, content can be downloaded to the device remotely.  For example, a child can send a video message or a fairy tale.  The cartoon collection, since the development of the product, has become more extensive.  And another interesting point - home mini-cinema received covers with NFC-tags.  With their help, the user can update the library content. <br><br>  The company says that <a href="https://cinemood.com/">CINEMOOD</a> is not a <a href="https://cinemood.com/">picoprojector</a> competitor, but home theaters.  Central Asia - families with children. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/eba/09f/835/eba09f835cb845af9ac243194efad8f6.jpg"><br><br><h3>  How it all works </h3><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/cY-Xx2vmhSY" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br>  The mini-cinema Cinemood (it is also called Multikubik 2.0) can work without recharging for about 3 hours at the expense of a capacious battery.  If it is turned on for about 20 minutes a day (show a video fairy tale or cartoon to a child before going to bed), the resource will last for a week. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/f2d/036/4ba/f2d0364baa8c42d6b5d6ee82d6bafddd.jpg"><br><br>  The device itself is like a cube, on the edges of which are buttons.  Both children and their parents can cope with management, no matter how far they are from technology. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/618/099/188/618099188c924b84bf1873f35f2e568e.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/615/311/397/6153113978fe4e3db890351b31b497e3.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/480/4a8/5f1/4804a85f1886406ab5004074b6eeddbd.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/c18/e79/442/c18e7944255d4bc0a2c0bb68ffe86fd2.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/841/8fc/12d/8418fc12d3db4501b670027951fd1d0f.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/484/2f7/832/4842f783275e43b0a72bbea5f6e382fc.jpg"><br><br>  <b>Content:</b> <br><br><ul><li>  135 Russian cartoons, 20 filmstrips, 32 audio fairy tales, 11 albums with lullabies, 6 lessons of the theater of shadows were downloaded in Russian. <br><br></li><li>  95 cartoon films, 20 filmstrips, 31 audio fairy-tales, 9 albums with lullabies, 6 lessons of the theater of shadows are downloaded in English. </li></ul><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/582/497/4db/5824974dbd7a4318a18e2db0d31d062a.jpg"><br><br>  The memory capacity of the device is 32 gigabytes, so you can load a lot of different content into Cinemood. <br><br>  By the way, the content was collected according to the recommendations of children's psychologists.  Filmstrips from the collection can also please adults who can remember the time when they themselves were children.  It is a great pleasure to get a slide projector, brush away the dust from it, turn on, having felt an incomparable smell after a while, fill the film and start watching filmstrip.  And it can be made to feel already a kid familiar with modern technology. <br><br>  True, unlike the overhead projector, the Cinemood does not heat up or make any noise.  The built-in lamp and its light do not spoil the child‚Äôs sight.  And the functions of a mini-cinema can be controlled from the phone, which in this case plays the role of a console.  To manage, you need to download a proprietary mobile application.  The device uses a DMD matrix - 640x360 pixels. <br><br>  A child who does not want to fall asleep without a bedtime story can use this mini-cinema.  Yes, nobody has canceled parental attention, no technique will replace it.  But if you suddenly fail to put the baby, you can try to turn on cartoons on the mini-cinema, turning off the device remotely when the child falls asleep. <br><br>  Adults such device may also be useful.  For example, you want to view a video or photo from the rest?  Simply connect the USB flash drive to the Cinemood Storyteller using the included USB-OTG adapter and watch.  Thanks to the Bluetooth module, wireless speakers can be connected to the device.  If you can not work with Bluetooth, there is a normal 3.5 ‚Ä≥ audio jack. <br><br>  <b>Covers</b> <br><br>  Usually the case is put on the gadget to protect it from scratches and other troubles.  In the case of Cinemood, this is all true, but there is one more thing.  The fact is that when putting the cover on the device, it recognizes the type of cover (using NFC tags). <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/25d/18c/910/25d18c91032e404c8a176f28ed95de8d.jpg"><br><br>  In the memory of the device from the "cloud", new cartoon series with a character are automatically loaded, the cover in the form of which is now worn.  Want "Smesharikov"?  Please, here they are.  In addition, <a href="http://madrobots.ru/p/cinemood-smart-cover/%3Futm_source%3Dgeektimes.ru%26utm_medium%3Dpr%26utm_campaign%3Dcinemood">covers are also available</a> with the characters "Om Yum", "Seals, Go!", "HooplaKidz".
