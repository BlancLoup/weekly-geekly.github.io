  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Whence there is a complex number</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  In modern mathematics, a complex number is one of the most fundamental concepts, which is applied both in ‚Äúpure science‚Äù and in applied fields.  It is clear that this was not always the case.  In the distant past, when even the usual negative numbers seemed a strange and dubious innovation, the need to expand the square root operation on them was not at all obvious.  Nevertheless, in the middle of the XVI century, the mathematician Raphael Bombelli <a href="http://storage.lib.uchicago.edu/pres/2005/pres2005-188.pdf">introduces</a> complex (in this case more precisely, imaginary) numbers into circulation.  Actually, I propose to look at what was the essence of the difficulties, which resulted in a solid Italian at the end of such extremes. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  There is a common misconception that complex numbers are required in order to solve quadratic equations.  Actually, this is absolutely not the case: the problem of finding the roots of a quadratic equation does not in any way motivate the introduction of complex numbers.  That's perfect. <br><br>  Let's see for yourself.  Any quadratic equation can be represented as: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/9d5/97e/495/9d597e4957eb186549b18a2afeca4c11.png" title="x ^ 2 = kx + b">  . <br>  Geometrically, this means that we want to find the crossing points of some straight line <img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/984/884/4ec/9848844ec630f2c3940090a52ef079b6.png" title="y = kx + b">  and parabolas <img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/f75/5d5/1c2/f755d51c21120e34a57176a8ead31536.png" title="y = x ^ 2."><br>  I even made a picture here, for illustration. <br><br><img alt="square" src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/719/c5d/dd7/719c5ddd71b56d6736d38dd189ca6c1e.png" title="square"><br>  As we all know well from school, the roots of the quadratic equation (in the above notation) are found using the following formula: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/4ba/e2c/82e/4bae2c82e4ea892460fab468a7cbb901.png" title="x_ {1,2} = \ frac {k} {2} \ pm \ sqrt {\ frac {k ^ 2} {4} + b}.">

      There are 3 possible options: <br>  1. The radical expression is positive. <br>  2. The radical expression is zero. <br>  3. The radical expression is negative. <br><br>  In the first case, there are 2 different roots, in the second two are the same, in the third, the equation is ‚Äúnot solved‚Äù.  All these cases have quite a clear geometric interpretation: <br>  1. A straight line intersects a parabola (the blue straight line in the figure). <br>  2. The straight line concerns the parabola. <br>  3. A straight line does not have common points with a parabola (the lilac straight line in the figure). <br><br>  The situation is simple, logical, consistent.  There is absolutely no reason to try to extract the square root from a negative number.  No one tried. <br><br>  The situation changed significantly when an inquiring mathematical thought reached the cubic equations.  Slightly less obvious, using some <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%259A%25D1%2583%25D0%25B1%25D0%25B8%25D1%2587%25D0%25B5%25D1%2581%25D0%25BA%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B5_%25D1%2583%25D1%2580%25D0%25B0%25D0%25B2%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B5">simple substitution</a> , every cubic equation can be reduced to the form: <img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/05b/09c/567/05b09c567d4ae9ea2a1ffc2187a63a54.png" title="x ^ 3 = kx + b">  .  From a geometrical point of view, the situation is similar to the previous one: we are looking for the intersection point of a straight line and a cubic parabola. <br>  Take a look at the picture: <br><img alt="cube" src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/745/f15/e79/745f15e795b722668e82bfa8fd0b8a19.png" title="cube"><br><br>  The essential difference from the case of a quadratic equation is that no matter which straight line we take, it always crosses a parabola.  That is, from purely geometric considerations, a cubic equation always has at least one solution. <br>  You can find it using the Cardano formula: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/b9e/3f1/478/b9e3f14783ad0b2458bdc73bb5b35609.png" title="x = \ sqrt [3] {\ frac {b} {2} + \ sqrt {\ Phi}} + \ sqrt [3] {\ frac {b} {2} - \ sqrt {\ Phi}},"><br>  Where <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/c15/ddb/97e/c15ddb97e47cf25ecc5f45e8e5bf2e40.png" title="\ Phi = \ left (\ frac {b} {2} \ right) ^ 2 - \ left (\ frac {k} {3} \ right) ^ 3.">  . <br>  A bit cumbersome, but so far, it seems, everything is in order.  Or not? <br><br>  In general, the Cardano formula is a vivid example of the <a href="http://lurkmore.to/%25D0%259F%25D1%2580%25D0%25B8%25D0%25BD%25D1%2586%25D0%25B8%25D0%25BF_%25D0%2590%25D1%2580%25D0%25BD%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BB%25D1%258C%25D0%25B4%25D0%25B0">‚ÄúArnold principle‚Äù</a> in action.  And characteristically, Cardano never claimed to have authorship of a formula. <br><br>  Let us return, however, to our sheep.  The formula is wonderful, without exaggeration, the great achievement of mathematics in the early to mid-sixteenth century.  But she has one nuance. <br>  Take the classic example that was considered by Bombelli: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/76d/72e/8da/76d72e8da8bc0a50a01424af47274b43.png" title="x ^ 3 = 15x + 4">  . <br>  Suddenly, <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/ba1/246/1e6/ba12461e61b1f436d3bfbffc732697e3.png" title="\ Phi = -121">  , <br>  and correspondingly, <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/d75/006/448/d7500644862f9b71205db936e51cbf4a.png" title="x = \ sqrt [3] {2+ \ sqrt {-121}} + \ sqrt [3] {2- \ sqrt {-121}}.">  . <br>  Sailed.  And the formula is a pity, but the formula is good.  Dead end.  Given that the equation, of course, has a solution. <br><br>  The idea of ‚Äã‚ÄãRafael Bombelli was as follows: let's pretend to be a hose and pretend that the root of the negative is a certain number.  Of course, we know that there are no such numbers, but nevertheless, let us imagine that it exists and, like ordinary numbers, it can be added to others, multiplied, raised to a power, etc. <br><br>  Using a similar approach, Bombelli established, in particular, that <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/f00/489/9f8/f004899f88be98b309119149c8b10cc9.png" title="\ sqrt [3] {2+ \ sqrt {-121}} = 2 + \ sqrt {-1}">  , <br>  and <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/409/98a/96c/40998a96c1da44e529e5a9c0d8252d06.png" title="\ sqrt [3] {2- \ sqrt {-121}} = 2 - \ sqrt {-1}.">  . <br>  Let's check: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/b32/b69/787/b32b69787eacdf17396e43fac9be8cb5.png" title="\ left (2 + \ sqrt {-1} \ right) ^ 3 = 2 ^ 3 + 3 \ cdot 2 ^ 2 \ cdot \ sqrt {-1} + 3 \ cdot 2 \ cdot \ left (\ sqrt {-1 } \ right) ^ 2 + \ left (\ sqrt {-1} \ right) ^ 3 = 8 + 12 \ sqrt {-1} - - 6 - \ sqrt {-1} = 2 + \ sqrt {-121} .">  . <br>  Notice, in the calculations, no assumptions about the properties of the square roots of negative numbers were assumed, except for the above assumption that they behave like "ordinary" numbers. <br><br>  In total, we get <img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/ee4/ca3/a75/ee4ca3a75ac2dc2999b1a3b33d224cdd.png" title="x = 2 + \ sqrt {-1} + 2 - \ sqrt {-1} = 4.">  .  That is quite a correct answer, which is elementary verified by direct substitution.  It was a real breakthrough.  Breakthrough in the complex plane. <br><br>  Nevertheless, such calculations look like some magic, a mathematical focus.  The attitude towards them, as to a certain trick, remained among mathematicians for a very long time.  Actually, invented by Rene Descartes for the roots of the negative name "imaginary numbers" fully reflects the attitude of mathematicians of those times to such entertainment. <br><br>  However, as time went on, the ‚Äútrick‚Äù was applied with unchanged success, the authority of ‚Äúimaginary numbers‚Äù in the eyes of the mathematical society grew, restrained, however, by the inconvenience of their use.  Only getting Leonard Euler (by the way, it was he who introduced the now commonly used designation <img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/6f3/421/f1e/6f3421f1ebfeb1268aea153e60bf04a7.png" title="i">  for imaginary unit) famous formula <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/7db/891/6f3/7db8916f38640d122d6e1f2703fb0c54.png" title="e ^ {i \ phi} = \ cos \ phi + i \ sin \ phi"><br>  opened the way for complex numbers to the most diverse areas of mathematics and its applications.  But that's another story. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/246747/">https://habr.com/ru/post/246747/</a></p>
