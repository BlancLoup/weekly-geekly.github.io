And many just suffer from procrastination, and try to live unsuccessfully by methods that require iron will power and organization - work according to plan. <br><br>  Below are a few of my thoughts on how to be someone who doesn‚Äôt pretend this topic, but somehow they need to organize their affairs. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h3>  No need to be like everyone else </h3><br>  Many people suffer by comparing themselves to others.  This includes looking at how a number of people live according to a strict schedule and achieve success.  Trying to live it yourself and fail.

      First of all, in my opinion, you should abandon attempts to measure your movement with other people's frameworks, and develop your own criteria / metrics for determining your progress.  Provided that you want it, of course.  For admitting that you have a problem. <br><br><h3>  Creative people hate routine </h3><br>  People in IT, as a rule, are creative (I‚Äôm not talking about programmers for the most part).  We do not like routine.  Therefore, we always strive to automate repetitive operations, to do the task in a general way, not to do it a second time, and so on. <br><br>  At the same time, the way the planning and organization techniques are laid out is a routine.  Therefore, it is not surprising that keeping timekeeping or writing out plans daily (and even more so to follow them) quickly becomes boring, or simply disgusting. <br><br>  It is necessary to use strengths, as they say.  Therefore, all that can be simplified and automated - you need to simplify and automate.  In the first place - to exclude from your life.  There is even an exercise such as throwing out trash and restoring order at home.  Distractions and the ability to say no to them - one of the main chips.  She requires will, but more on that below.  In the meantime, read the <a href="http://siliconrus.com/2013/05/no/">article</a> where creative people say no to not be distracted.  After all, you're a creative person? <br><br>  <i>It is worth noting that there are many creative people who are talented, and at the same time live on a strict schedule - the same sportsmen, for example.</i>  <i>But they don't need such articles, do they?</i> <br><h3>  Small will bricks </h3><br>  Still, the abstract desire to deal with their affairs needs to be moved in reality.  And to translate into reality you need such a thing as will.  But she refuses to write plans and other things, so how to be? <br><br>  Here you must first realize that how much do not paint architecture on paper, until you write the code - the program will not work.  So in the organization, how many articles do not read - until you take the first steps, things will not move. <br><br>  Help us come our bodies.  We have such a thing as habits.  Or something like macros.  Roughly speaking, if you do something small every day (or at least many times a week), then it comes easier and easier.  And then completely on the machine.  Something like brushing your teeth. <br><br>  Try to do the simple things you need, every evening or morning (the larks / owls will find the right mode for themselves).  Record your expenses, for example, in the mobile.  Or write a post in a diary. <br><br>  Gradually, you will pump up your willpower to make small jerks, but you don‚Äôt need more. <br><br><h3>  Body and brain variable </h3><br>  In general, we are very dependent on our body.  First, lack of sleep.  If you have not slept well - you will be drowsy, nothing will be wanted.  Similarly, with excess sleep. <br><br>  Then, of course, food.  Fruits, vitamins, meats, sweet tea / coffee help.  But hunger or monotonous, without an abundance of nutrients food and without diversity is not the best way affects the performance and stupid desire to do something. <br><br>  Plus hormones - you know yourself, the more testosterone, for example, the more energy a man has for different things. <br><br>  Plus, the weather and external factors - they affect how a sine wave, even the presence of the sun can have a strong effect. <br><br>  Add more dependence on physical activity - if you are physically developed, or at least walk half an hour a day - you already give a big plus to yourself.  For the body is sharpened for physical work, and when you do it, the body raises general tone and performance. <br><br>  Even music and mood (interconnected things) are a good mood, or, on the contrary, evil (someone is negatively motivated) influences your desire to engage in some kind of activity. <br><br>  All this to the fact that you need to be ready, that your performance is floating.  Someone will call inspiration, someone a flash of labor enthusiasm.  The practical conclusion is one - catch the moments when rushing, and strike while the iron is hot.  And do not be discouraged, if not rushing, just waste your nerves. <br><br><h3>  Evolutionary roadmap </h3><br>  We are constantly zaserat brain all around.  Society, relatives, colleagues, advertising, the Internet, TV (who watches), the past, books, and so on.  And many desires and ‚Äúresponsibilities‚Äù are imposed from the outside, or that we have assumed due to the weak ability to send the fuck. <br><br>  It is necessary to write out common vectors, "tricks" in some kind of cloud piece, and mercilessly clean it.  So that only that which is really rushing, plus a small number of really important responsibilities (such as communication with family, maintaining health), remains. <br><br>  It is important to note that creative people are strong, as written in the article on spontaneous planning, can do several things.  Therefore, for the sake of diversity, turn on several differently directed vectors for your development, contrary to the common theme of ‚Äúfocus on one goal and score on another‚Äù.  The question is always a percentage of time-consuming :) <br><br><h3>  Three modes of operation </h3><br>  I select three modes of operation.  Mode 1 and 2 should not overlap within the same day, mode three can be at any time. <br><br>  1. Stream <br>  This is stated above in the article.  In the mode of the flow is good to solve problems without time limits.  It is necessary that no one distracts (turn off everything and go offline).  Sit all the way, and do while rushing. <br>  This also includes meeting with clients, when it is unclear how long it will last. <br><br>  A good regime, there should be as many of these as possible, because it is efficient and not annoying, measured work without the harshest time frames that are straining. <br><br>  2. Fire fighting <br>  This is the maximum concentration mode, such as technical support responses and quick fixes for bugs.  Got a task - made a hotfix - forgot - took the following to work.  To solve issues as quickly and simply as possible (for example, to promptly stir up a questionnaire on the site - you load the Google Docs widget into a form, 5 minutes instead of installing ready-made quiz systems or writing your own, what an ordinary person will offer; or you need to correct the production and the client will sign on the fly, the text in the database is corrected, and the task of creating a normal admin for this functionality is put to people verbally, similarly with raising servers. <br><br>  Not very cool mode, squeezes out all the juice.  But sometimes it is necessary when cases are grouped together (or an unanticipated situation has arisen that always happens) <br><br>  3. Stupid <br>  Normal mode, when you read something on the Internet.  If you apply a little willpower, then you can at least read Habr, instead of LJ or Lepre.  And a little more training - and already write quotes and approaches, which then come in handy. <br><br><h3>  Cloud hard drive </h3><br>  For all of the above, any simple cloud notebook suitable for taking notes and easy to categorize and search by text / category. <br><br><h3>  The evolution of a simple design home </h3><br>  As practice shows, everything evolves.  Even lovers of designing everything from scratch are gone. <br>  Although the desire to ‚Äúdo everything right at once‚Äù is still waking up in us no-no, everything has long been living according to the laws of natural selection.  RUP left, giving way to Agile.  In programming lives XP and evolutionary design, continuous integration.  Startups do not develop in megaplanes, through MVP and then evolution.  Businesses are not done through megabusiness plans, but by constant quick small steps. <br><br>  Although in some places still need the good old design, such as in the construction of houses or bridges, but these areas are less. <br><br>  Therefore, make the system by yourself, how to write the code, how to draw the design.  Made a simple, tried, improved, and so all the time. <br><br><h3>  Instead of conclusion </h3><br>  I hope some of the considerations will come to your advantage.  You can describe your success stories, how you achieved success, while not loving the classic planning and organization techniques that are trying to shove you into the Procrustean time management box. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/247021/">https://habr.com/ru/post/247021/</a></p>
