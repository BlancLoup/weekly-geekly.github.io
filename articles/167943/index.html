    <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  <b>Who are all these people and what are they doing there?</b>  The battle of Asakai clearly involved 2 parties.  The core of side A was the Goonswarm Federation, Razor Alliance and Tribal Band alliances, let's call them the Huns and Co.  The core of side B, by and large, were 2 large alliances: Pandemic Legion, and Test Alliance Please Ignore, for simplicity we call them Testopands.  The battle occurred due to the error of the pilot of side A, which was that the pilot confused the buttons in the drop-down menu, and instead of sending the fleet into the system to the enemy, he jumped there himself, which caused the ensuing massacre.  Turning away from the topic, I will say that somewhere once every half a year there is always an individual who confuses these buttons and gives his titanium to the slaughter of the enemy laughing with joy. <br><br>  <b>Why are they fighting?</b>  Not so long ago, parties A and B lived in peace and harmony, avoided shooting and conflicts, and, one can even say, were in the same power block.  But some conflict did arise, the official version says that the leader of the Test Alliance Please Ignore did not compliment the Tribal Band alliance and wanted to press them in the territories, which did not please the Goonswarm Federation alliance and contributed to the breakdown of relations.  There was no particular confrontation, but the notorious mistake of the pilot of side A served to escalate the conflict. <br><br>  <b>Who won in the end?</b>  Side A suffered much more tangible losses than side B. The reason for this was the acceptance of the battle on obviously unfavorable conditions and the error of the fleet commander A (the titans of side A, thrown to the aid of the fleet, could not use their main weapon in the Asakai system, imposed by the security level of this system, and were good targets for maserships, which the party B was like a fool wrappers. Matershpi, in turn, in systems with a low level of security could easily realize all their combat sweat  potential).  In addition, pilots from the side of B were significantly more than pilots from the side of A. <br><br>  <b>How much real money is left on the battlefield?</b>  To answer this question, we will carry out a simple calculation ‚Äî we will compare the magnitude of the losses with the cost of the plex in rubles and find out the approximate magnitude of the losses in hard currency.  Immediately I will explain that PLEX is inside a game item, which allows you to pay a subscription (EVE Online has a subscription model), which can be bought from other players for inside game currency.  Other players, in turn, buy complexes from CCP (the office that developed EVE Online) for real money, then sell them for games, and then buy some boat or some other bling.  So, judging by the schedule presented by CCP, on the battlefield, there are about 710 milliards left in the game currency.  Plex, at the time of this writing, costs about 540 million in game currency.  It is not difficult to calculate that the damage is estimated at 1,315 plexes.  The package of 28 plexes on the EVE Online site is 14999 rubles.  Accordingly, having carried out simple mathematical calculations, we find that losses on both sides amounted to ~ 700 thousand rubles.  However, we should not forget that all the ships in the game are insured, and the pilot of the capital-class ship (and few capital ships do not insure), taking into account the cost of insurance, receives about 60% of the ship's cost when it is lost.  Accordingly, real losses amounted to approximately 250-350 thousand rubles.  And this is if the currency was taken from the only legal suppliers - CCP, if the currency was bought directly from the players (which is strictly forbidden by the rules of the game), the losses are estimated much lower. <br><br>  <b>Is it over for party A?</b>  Side A has suffered serious losses, but it does not smell like an end in this case.  Huns and Co.  a very large and strong formation, and three titans and five maserships for them is not that loss too terrifying.  Perceptible, but not fatal.  In the history of EVE, there have been more dramatic and tangible losses that were suffered not by large alliances, but by single players. <br><br>  But who knows what the escalation of the conflict will turn into in the future?  Keep abreast, as they say. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/167943/">https://habr.com/ru/post/167943/</a></p>
