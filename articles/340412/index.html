These are primarily people who have gathered to create, program, implement, promote.  The team you chose when you came to work and the team that chose you.  These are the technologies that we use and that we develop for the world.  For someone, this is a startup, for someone, a young <s>promising dynamic</s> company, for someone, a giant corporation.  For us, this is LANIT, which turned 28 years old on October 16.  And you know, we cannot say whether it is a lot or a little.  On the one hand, 28 years is an experience, on the other - some of our technologies have just appeared. <br><br> <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/company/lanit/blog/340412/"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/735/a6d/e38/735a6de38c3637db44710a4a2ee1ab30.jpg"></a> <br>  <i>"Eighty-three percent of all the days in the year start the same way: the alarm clock rings."</i>  <i>And our departments with incredible names begin their work.</i>  <i>This is a photo of a real stand with keys in LANIT.</i> <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/7c3/07f/44a/7c307f44a4f1f2892accdc2298b230d2.jpg"><br>  <i>‚ÄúAnd what's the point of buying a car to drive around on asphalt?‚Äù</i>  <i>Where asphalt is, nothing interesting, and where it is interesting, there is no asphalt there. ‚Äù</i>  <i>And where there is no asphalt, we go on a real flying carpet.</i> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/c75/3f4/d8d/c753f4d8ddfd086e0672b11fcaf403b6.jpg"><br>  <i>‚ÄúThere is no one future for all.</i> <i><br></i>  <i>There are many of them, and each of your actions creates one of them ...

    <div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">By the way, do you know how LANIT stands for?</b> <div class="spoiler_text">  LANIT is the ‚ÄúLaboratory of New <b>and</b> Information Technologies‚Äù, which was founded on October 16, 1989. <br></div></div><br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/7XE1chts5jo" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>  <i>We have even made the numbers of the lived and spent years in the context of technologies: software and engineering.</i>  <i>Coherent and complex design - everything, as we love.</i> <br><br><h2>  As a rug in the elevator gave start to an unusual corporate </h2><br>  To arrange a holiday for several thousand programmers and engineers, and even in different offices, is not an easy task.  Anyone familiar with the corporate culture in IT companies will understand us: busy people who have no time for anything, are not happy with the usual activities such as going to nature or cakes in the dining room.  "Well, do not need cakes!" - We thought, sitting down in the office elevator.  What do you need? <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/25c/b31/1cf/25cb311cfa2bad30a0874d74adc81a04.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/59/e7/3c/59e73cb74939e260248475.png"><br><br>  And then the look fell on the mat in the elevator.  It so happened that every day the elevators of our office meet employees with reminders of the current day of the week.  As some employees go to work and on weekends, these rugs are ... six: from Monday to Saturday.  On Sunday, everyone needs to rest.  So after Saturday, we immediately come Monday.  Almost like the Strugatskys, Monday begins on Saturday.  And this is an idea! <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/518/0e3/198/5180e3198568c1131c267660e8456cf3.jpg"><br>  <i>"- What are you doing?</i>  <i>- Like all science.</i>  <i>Human happiness. ‚Äù</i> <i><br></i>  <i>Updated signboard.</i>  <i>We think, is it worth it to shoot after the end of the holiday.</i> <br><br>  And now in all the offices we have launched a celebration project based on the story, and our LANIT has turned into a real REACH (although it never ceased to be). <br><br><blockquote>  Here came people who were more pleasant to be with each other than separately, who could not tolerate any kind of resurrection, because on Sunday they were bored.  Magi, People with a capital letter, and their motto was - "Monday begins on Saturday." </blockquote><br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/59/e7/41/59e741bec3ffa004577231.jpeg"></div>  <i>Our people not only came, but also arrived ... on festive corporate transport.</i> <br><br>  The celebration has already started and seems to have attracted even the most gloomy and busy. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/520/a6b/c7e/520a6bc7e1574b6820219e932bc38173.jpg"><br>  <i>‚ÄúI have one friend.</i>  <i>He claims that man is only an intermediate link that nature needs to create the crown of creation: glasses of brandy with a slice of lemon. ‚Äù</i>  <i>For now tea with dryers</i> <br><br>  Because we are the very company where people have connected their mental and physical resources in order to create solutions that really make history: for example, to develop and implement the most complex state information systems.  And all those magicians do it.  For them, the most common daily work - intellectual, and sometimes physical labor. <br><br>  By the way, if you feel the power of a magician, then the team <s>NIICHAVO</s> LANIT <a href="https://job.lanit.ru/Pages/default.aspx%3Futm_source%3Dhabr%26utm_medium%3Dposting%26utm_campaign%3Dall_vacancy">has vacancies</a> . <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/59/e7/42/59e74227827eb320855723.jpeg"></div><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/59/e7/42/59e742ab89994024568651.jpeg"></div>  <i>These are the prediction cookies received by all our magicians on the company's birthday.</i> <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/59/e7/3e/59e73eb7f2e76462723025.jpeg"></div><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/08f/a5a/dbb/08fa5adbb470608565e52a19f0d9d3da.jpg"><br>  <i>And from individual quotations it was possible, together with colleagues, to collect an entire chapter from the book of the Strugatsky.</i> <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/59/e7/3f/59e73fa5848eb791048004.jpeg"></div>  <i>In some divisions of LANIT, the question of collecting quotes was approached systematically - they brought a file to Google Docs, in which they noted all the fragments and the names of their owners.</i> <br><br>  First of all, we strive to form a team of high professional level - one that is able to work on almost any task.  Obviously, such a team should be united, because "when there is no agreement with friends, they will not get on well."  LANIT does everything for this: who works with us or just visited the office, knows that we are open to new employees, to dialogue, we are comfortable, stylish.  But there is one important ‚Äúbut‚Äù: we are a team of professionals and expect the same from new employees.  It is important for us that the specialists coming to LANIT already have the knowledge and understand how to apply it, want to learn.  And we invite the most capable trainees, give them opportunities for development and do not engage in over-care. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/59/e7/43/59e74320bbc3f496501121.jpeg"></div><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/59/e7/47/59e7471104146582113986.jpeg"></div><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/59/e7/47/59e7470291caa450397759.jpeg"></div><br>  In LANIT work for 10-15 years and even longer!  This may cause a discussion about what a person should develop, change the team, the environment, the chair ... And why should this not be done within a huge team?  Grow, learn and even move from office to office.  Can!  Such a long period of work in one company is easily explained: <br><br><ul><li>  horizontal and vertical growth opportunities are always open; <br></li><li>  interesting to implement holistic, long-term and very large projects; <br></li><li>  LANIT is not outdated in terms of technology - everything that appears new can be adopted; <br></li><li>  work is comfortable in all senses; <br></li><li>  this is sure stability. <br></li></ul><br><blockquote>  Personally, I see this as the finger of fate - they walked through the forest and met a programmer. </blockquote><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/59/e7/43/59e743b6c894a810121526.jpeg"></div>  <i>Yes this is a recursion!</i> <br><br>  And most importantly, we maintain leadership qualities and innovative spirit in our employees.  Yes, working in a team, where everyone has the makings of a leader, is very difficult.  But such people fit perfectly into our ambitious projects without too much pathos.  And therefore we invented a holiday, on which each of the employees will receive not only something pleasant, but also an important wish from the books of the Strugatsky. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/59/e7/40/59e7408990e19342172063.jpeg"></div>  <i>Seals on their shoulders doing liftoluk were out of competition.</i> <br><br><blockquote>  Among them, no one knew exactly what happiness is and what is the meaning of life.  And they accepted the working hypothesis that happiness is in continuous knowledge of the unknown and the meaning of life is the same. </blockquote><br><h2>  Off philosophy, only numbers and facts </h2><br>  We went into philosophy and reasoning, although we know more than anyone that only figures and facts can characterize a group of companies.  Therefore, we counted them for you. <br><br><ul><li>  The INSISTEMS specialists have designed a giant refrigerating center for the Vostochny cosmodrome: its capacity is 8.75 MW, which is comparable to the cooling system of six ice rinks or a complex of office buildings with an area of ‚Äã‚Äãabout 150 thousand square meters.  m <br></li><li>  Customers who use Oncloud, saved over three years 70,000,000 rubles and did not buy nearly 500 high-performance servers for business applications. <br></li><li>  As part of the technical re-equipment of the ground-based meteorological observation network of Roshydromet, we upgraded 85 meteorological centers throughout Russia, more than 40 central and cluster radio stations, 210 automatic stations and supplied more than 1600 automated meteorological sets. <br></li><li>  ‚ÄúNetworking Academy LANIT‚Äù has trained more than 350,000 people.  The largest pool of full-time education amounted to 78,000 people from 84 constituent entities of the Russian Federation.  These were courses for those who took part in the state final assessment at the examination points.  61 000 students have been trained and successfully passed the final test. <br></li><li>  We on Habr√© incomplete 9 months.  During this time, 1433 Habr users positively voted for us, negatively - 165, the overall rating of our 36 posts is +1268, 1,474 comments left to our articles, 2126 times added to the ‚ÄúFavorites‚Äù, and we scored 426,247 views.  And everything is just beginning! <br></li></ul><br><blockquote>  We want everything to be immediately explained rationally, that is, reduced to a handful of already known facts.  And none of us have a damn of dialectics.  It does not occur to anyone that between the known facts and some new phenomenon the sea of ‚Äã‚Äãthe unknown may lie, and then we declare the new phenomenon supernatural and, therefore, impossible. </blockquote><br>  28 years ago we in LANIT tried to imagine what the new technological world would be like, but even the wildest fantasies did not make it to the top ten.  We live in the era of a grand digital transformation - technologies are developing at a speed of "five years in half a year."  We believe that there will be 50th anniversary of LANIT.  And we will write about it article on Habr.  Well or we will place the hologram in virtual habrareality.  Or maybe send a message with a compressed beam from the office on the satellite.  In the meantime, we will check that the Earth does not fall from the circle - no matter what speed the technician takes. <br><blockquote> Design thought can not stand still.  This is the law of social development. </blockquote><br>  <i>PS: All the above quotes are taken from the story of Arkady and Boris Strugatsky "Monday begins on Saturday."</i> <br><br>  <b>You can write greetings and wishes in the comments, and instead of a postcard subscribe to our blog - for us it will be a pleasant sign of attention, and you will not miss the cool articles that we prepare for Habr almost every week.</b> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/340412/">https://habr.com/ru/post/340412/</a></p>
