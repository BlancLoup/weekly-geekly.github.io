  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Useful lessons for the programmer</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Many probably are looking for such classes, which would be both pleasant for the person and useful in terms of the development of certain skills.  For programmers, and indeed people with sedentary work, these classes should be their own. <br><br>  1) Juggling. <br><br>  Juggling is a wonderful thing, good for both health and soul.  What is the use of juggling? <br>  For a start, this is a good exercise for the eyes, removing tension from them, which is important, given the constant work at the computer.  Then, it is physical exercise (albeit small) both on the arms and on the legs (in the beginning you will have to constantly bend down to lift the falling projectiles).  Well, in the end, it is a moral satisfaction from the fact that you manage to manipulate objects in the air.  Juggling does not require any fixtures.  Three (for the beginning of two) items of such a shape are enough to make it convenient to catch and throw up, preferably not too light, but not heavy. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  The Internet is full of videos on how to learn to juggle, for example <br>  <a href="http://www.howcast.com/videos/944-How-To-Juggle-Three-Balls">www.howcast.com/videos/944-How-To-Juggle-Three-Balls</a> <br>  And the sweetest - juggling activates the joint work of both hemispheres, which stimulates the creative process and allows you to write good code.  Well, the last - this is speculation. 
      <br>
        <script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>
        <ins class="adsbygoogle"
          style="display:block; text-align:center;"
          data-ad-layout="in-article"
          data-ad-format="fluid"
          data-ad-client="ca-pub-6974184241884155"
          data-ad-slot="8945601208"></ins>
        <script>
          (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
        </script>
      <br>
      2) Sleyting <br><br>  Probably, few people have heard about what is slaiting, because there is not even an article about Wikipedia about it.  Essentially, sleeting is ‚Äúsleight of hand‚Äù, manipulating maps.  To make it clear what I mean, here's a video. <br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3DMwdOG5Ul7OY">www.youtube.com/watch?v=MwdOG5Ul7OY</a> <br>  Again, why this is needed.  Again training for the eyes, since you have to focus on the maps in your hands, but this is not the main thing.  The main thing is fine motor skills.  "Scientists have proved that from an anatomical point of view, about a third of the entire area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe motor projection of the cerebral cortex is occupied by a projection of the hand, located very close to the speech zone." associated with the manipulation of objects by the fingers.  It may even increase the speed of dialing a good code, but again this is just speculation. <br>  And of course, it is possible to surprise your friends and friends (which is much more important than your friends and friends) when playing poker or playing a fool for undressing. <br>  Yes, by the way, pinspinning can be attributed to the same category. <br><br>  3) Twine <br><br>  Learn to do the splits.  It is not so difficult as it seems.  Especially important for those who sit in one place all day.  This not only stretches the muscles, improves blood circulation, but also relieves stress and tension, gives tone to the whole body.  Everyone can learn the twine, and the benefits of it just a lot.  And again, the Internet is full of materials about how to learn stretching, you can, for example, read here <br>  <a href="http://stranasovetov.su/view_post.php%3Fid%3D578">stranasovetov.su/view_post.php?id=578</a> <br>  I would like to note that the benefits of the splits are not only physical.  Stretching stimulates blood circulation throughout the body, including in the brain, improves the overall condition of the body, drives off drowsiness and weakness.  Thanks to this, a person writes a good and beautiful code. <br><br>  Well, the maximum effect is obtained if you combine all these classes together. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/124032/">https://habr.com/ru/post/124032/</a></p>
