  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Review of the project Webprice.ru or "Necessary things for good people"</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Nowadays, the concept of "deficit" has practically disappeared, and the main difficulty for the average citizen now is not to find and buy a thing, having stood in a huge queue, but to find a thing at the lowest price.  The easiest way to do this on the Web, because where else can you compare the cost of goods in several stores?  Fortunately, the latest on the Internet now is also a huge amount.  In order to make life easier for potential buyers, new services have appeared that show WHERE you can buy a product, at WHAT PRICE you can buy it, and find out the MAIN CHARACTERISTICS of the product.  True, most of these services have a number of drawbacks - it often happens that by clicking on this link, we either don‚Äôt find the desired position at all, or we find one, but at a price different from that shown by the intermediary service.  In general, at one time we ourselves tried to use such services, but quickly realized that it was still easier to create our own service, which would be deprived of already known problems, rather than trying to find something more or less close to the ideal.  And we made it, made your service!  <a href="http://www.webprice.ru/">Webprice.ru</a> is a service that shows where and how much you can find the things you need, providing a wide range of possibilities.  About them - in the continuation of the review. <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  So, Webprice.ru consists of three main sections, one of which is already familiar to most of you, but the other two sections, or services, are unique.  The sections are called ‚ÄúMarket‚Äù, ‚ÄúSales‚Äù, ‚ÄúService Zone‚Äù. <br><br><img src="http://habreffect.ru/files/1e4/81e0a149c/home.png" alt="image">

      The Market is divided into several categories, including Computers and Peripherals, Photo and Video Equipment, Office Equipment, and others.  Each of the categories includes several subcategories where you can easily and conveniently select the desired item.  We tried to avoid the above problems, showing only real products at the current price. <br><br>  The difference of this section from the already existing sections is that you can select the necessary items for your office or home.  Indeed, it is very difficult to find everything you need for the office - a computer, scanner, printer, furniture, accessories.  With the help of our service, you can easily find everything you need by viewing the characteristics of the goods.  After that, it remains only to contact the sellers of these goods, agreeing on the timing of delivery.  And all - you can start work. <br>  Naturally, our service and the ‚ÄúMarket‚Äù section are convenient not only for buyers, but also for sellers, for companies offering their goods.  You not only provide your products to potential buyers, but also shift the responsibility of consulting buyers from yourself to our specialists. <br><br>  The ‚ÄúSales‚Äù section is unique, it allows you to tell a potential buyer that it is in your store that the right item is being sold at a significant, very significant discount. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/habraeffect/cf/06/cf06cba38e106f55d82124987ec85955.png" alt="image"><br><br>  A buyer, once in this section, with a couple of clicks can appear on your site - the interface of the ‚ÄúSales‚Äù section is intuitive for almost every web user. <br>  For any of the products shown in our section, specify the characteristics, description, equipment and fit the image.  The same assortment is updated automatically, several times a day.  As a result, the buyer sees only relevant products at the current price. <br>  The benefits for the buyer are clear: <br>  - buying the right thing at a low price; <br>  - small time expenditure; <br>  - everything can be done without leaving your computer; <br><br>  Finally, the ‚ÄúService Zone‚Äù section. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/habraeffect/37/07/37074cb7f227cb2d7548cf72861b630a.png" alt="image"><br><br>  In general, we were very surprised when we could not find something like this on any of the services similar to ours.  But the need for the service, indicating where you can solve the problem that has arisen with the equipment, has been long overdue.  And yet there are very few such services brought to mind.  In addition, it is also surprising that practically no site offering equipment shows where to turn if you need to fix or modify something.  Here the TV broke - and what to do, where to turn for help?  And if you know where, so maybe in another place it will be repaired faster and at a lower price?  Of course, this is possible, but only a few people would like to spend time searching. <br>  So, the project "Service" zone helps to solve a lot of daily problems associated with the repair of cars, computers, electronics, apartments, houses, offices and other premises.  This also includes the problem of finding service centers involved in the maintenance, installation, modification of all of this. <br><br>  This is what the ‚ÄúService Zone‚Äù section can offer our customers: <br><br>  car repair and maintenance; <br><br>  repair, modification and maintenance of computer equipment; <br><br>  repair of household appliances and electronics; <br><br>  cell phone repair; <br><br>  repair of apartments, offices, other visits, their maintenance; <br><br>  ¬∑ Installation and maintenance of business equipment; <br><br>  manufacture and repair of furniture; <br><br>  many other types of work. <br><br>  But what makes it profitable for service centers and repair shops: <br><br>  additional opportunities for company advertising and promotion of its services; <br><br>  the widest possible audience of target consumers; <br><br>  convenient, easy-to-use directory: potential customers get to your site in one click; <br><br>  the possibility of priority placement in the catalog, as a result - a greater flow of customers; <br><br>  placement of visual advertising of your service center or repair shop on our website throughout the entire period of cooperation; <br><br>  opportunity to find business partners. <br><br>  In general, we are proud of the created service, and we are confident that it can save you not one ten minutes when choosing a product, and not one thousand nerve cells.  Recent scientific studies claim that nerve cells do recover, but very, very slowly.  So it is better not to be nervous, but to search and find the REQUIRED THINGS on the NEED SERVICE, Webprice.ru. <br><br>  Clearly, we do not claim that service is perfection, it is new, it still needs to be run in.  Problems are still possible, we do not deny it.  Service is constantly updated, "bugs" are corrected, new goodies and gadgets appear. <br><br>  Why did we write all this?  In order to give you an idea of ‚Äã‚Äãwhat our service is, and in order for a respected community to test the service and help us to complement and improve the service.  In the end, I want to work in such a way that everyone likes our work (well, or the vast majority of visitors).  I'd like to feel that we NEED, and the things offered by our partners are REQUIRED THINGS.  Like this. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/101682/">https://habr.com/ru/post/101682/</a></p>
