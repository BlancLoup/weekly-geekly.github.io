  <section class="page js-page"><h1>PocketBook SURFpad Review</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Today I want to bring to your attention the review of the multimedia device PocketBook SURFpad. <br>  PocketBook position this model as a multimedia reader with the ability to watch videos and listen to music. <br>  However, these are marketing issues, and in fact - we have a compact and quite comfortable tablet.  Not without flaws, but rather interesting, let's look at its features in order. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/22c/e64/5fb/22ce645fb788137833e3849718282b5d.jpg"><br><br><a name="habracut"></a>

        <ins class="adsbygoogle"
          style="display:block; text-align:center;"
          data-ad-layout="in-article"
          data-ad-format="fluid"
          data-ad-client="ca-pub-6974184241884155"

      <br>
    <h4>  Kit, package </h4><br>  The kit is quite austere.  The box contains the device itself, placed in a special frame of foam material, it prevents the tablet from hanging in the box, so you can be sure that it is safe. <br>  In addition, the box contains a charger with a USB port, a quick start guide and a cable for transferring data and charging the device. <br>  No headphones, no cover.  If nobody uses complete headphones, the lack of a case can be a problem for some customers.  Such a modest set, apparently, is the result of an attempt to reduce the cost of the device. <br><br><h4>  Assembly design </h4><br>  The device is assembled very high quality, the main part of the case is white glossy plastic (there is also a dark gray version on sale), the back cover is made of black plastic with soft-touch coating. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/b4a/f4a/730/b4af4a7306422417fbacf192aac10426.jpg"><br><br>  The arrangement of the elements, the grooved edges of the back cover, the grooves along the edges of the front panel - all this suggests that first of all the designers assumed that the device would be used horizontally.  It is in this position that the tablet is most comfortable to hold, it will not slip, you can hold it with your left or right hand.  All this allows you to easily watch movies in transport. <br><br>  The memory card slot, headphone jack and for connecting to a computer are located on the right side of the tablet, the power button and volume rocker on the top, also on the right.  On the front side, to the right of the screen, there is a camera peephole, at the bottom of the front side, on the sides of the screen are the speaker holes.  It also speaks about the orientation of the device for use in a horizontal position, as a multimedia player or device for accessing the Internet. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/020/c6f/6da/020c6f6dae1f2bf7ad1f4263cba41d37.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/1cd/c80/d72/1cdc80d720b0c09c18b33a5303806d59.jpg"><br><br><h4>  Screen </h4><br>  Display in PocketBook SURFpad 7-inch with a resolution of 800 x 480 pixels.  It is made by TFT technology and demonstrates the average level of brightness and natural color reproduction.  The viewing angles are also not too wide.  However, for an inexpensive device the screen is acceptable, all the more so with the minimum brightness level set in the settings, it is quite comfortable to read from it.  Support for "multitouch" in SURFpad provided. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/dff/3b8/9fe/dff3b89fe1046dfa94f77b5ee00b816c.jpg"><br><br><h4>  Connection </h4><br>  The tablet has a built-in Wi-Fi 802.11 module (b / g / n).  Other wireless connections in the device is not provided.  In other words, on the road to go online is unlikely to succeed, unless you use a smartphone with Wi-Fi Tethering function. <br><br><h4>  System, programs </h4><br>  The tablet runs on Android OS version 4.0.4.  A number of programs are preinstalled in the original firmware, such as Obreey Store, Cool Reader, Office Suite Pro, Odnoklassniki, VKontakte, IM +, SPB TV, Gismeteo and Learn English.  Google services initially in the firmware is not, the application will be installed from the Obreey Store. <br>  However, there is a more recent version of the firmware, which allows you to work with standard Android 4.0.4 and install programs from Google Play. <br>  The device supports ten video formats - ASF, MKV, AVI, MP4, FLV, WEBM, 3GP, MOV, MPG, WMV, five audio formats - MP3, WMA, AAC, OGG, MIDI, ten text formats: EPUB, PDF, FB2, FB2.ZIP, TXT, HTM, HTML, DOC, DOCX, RTF and four graphics - JPEG, BMP, PNG, GIF. <br><br><h4>  CPU, memory. </h4><br>  PocketBook SURFpad works on the basis of a gigahertz Boxchip A13 processor (architecture Cortex-A8).  The tablet has 512 MB of RAM installed.  In general, this is more than enough for such a device: the operating speed is quite acceptable, in addition, SURFpad can play video in Full HD 1080p format.  For storing data, 4 GB of memory is preinstalled in the device, the expansion is supported using microSD cards up to 32 GB. <br><br><h4>  Nutrition </h4><br>  The device is pre-installed non-replaceable battery with a capacity of 3000 mAh. <br>  According to the developers, this is enough for 7 hours of mixed use or 6.5 hours of continuous video viewing. <br>  I will say right away that I didn‚Äôt have a need to use the device for 7 hours to a row, but for a couple of days in the ‚Äú4 hours on the way to work and back‚Äù mode, the tablet held out without problems. <br><br><h4>  Total </h4><br><br>  + Low cost of the device (about 3 500 rubles) <br>  + High-quality assembly, thoughtful design <br>  + A large number of media codecs supported out of the box <br>  + Low device weight <br><br>  - ascetic set <br>  -Not the best screen <br><br>  PS I can not stand here that is clear: similar devices "from China" can also be bought without any problems, but on the side of PocketBuk there is a guarantee, service and user support. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/169037/">https://habr.com/ru/post/169037/</a></p>
