It became interesting to me, and which of those causes the greatest irritation in reading Habr.  Therefore, I decided to create a <a href="http://enartemy.habrahabr.ru/blog/42519/">survey</a> on this topic.  I must say that I dislike polls, because among them there are few really useful ones.  But this idea seemed to me quite good. <br><br>  What happened in a day:

    <a name="habracut"></a><img src="http://img413.imageshack.us/img413/3493/oprosaw9.jpg"><br><br>  As expected, the most ‚Äúundesirable" for publication are topics aimed at disassembling about <b>karma and habrasila</b> .  Indeed, I myself, not so long ago, wrote to the administration a proposal to ban them altogether at the rule level.  Topics on these topics are not worth writing, about% username%.  If there is any problem, it is better to contact the administration. <br><br>  The second place is about the <b>iPhone</b> and Apple products in general.  Topics on these topics appear almost every day.  But is this mobile phone worth so much attention?  On the other hand, they may seem interesting to someone (especially to the owners of these aggregates), so I make a rational suggestion to make topics dedicated to this topic visible only to subscribers of relevant blogs.  Then the wolves are safe and the hares are full.  :)) <br><br>  In third place are <b>polls</b> .  There is such a proposal: good, very good, and then again very well think about the meaning of the published poll, and what really interesting facts it can reveal. <br><br>  In fourth place in our hit pair <b>Samiznaetekto</b> with his new song <i>"Oh *** but very cool, I am now steering the SUP</i> . <i>"</i>  Personally for me - Subject zadolbal not only on Habr√©, he zadolbal basically, and zadolbal just fucking.  He practically became a hero of anecdotes, on the same list with Stirlitz, Vasily Ivanovich, Pyatochka, and other heroes of ‚ÄúRussian folk art‚Äù.  Therefore, as well as in the case of Apple, it may be worthwhile to write articles related to SAL in the corresponding blog as a lock.  But about Lebedev a lot of interesting "exhaust", against them, I think, the population of Habr has nothing.  :-) <br><br>  In fifth place is <b>Lepretah</b> .  Gentlemen, keep in mind that not so many people, as you think, are on leprosy, and stories about her really cause irritation.  Let's talk about leprosy - talk on leprosy, okay?  And on Habr√© - about Habr.  :-) <br><br>  On the other topics, the external background is simply over-negative.  :-) By the way, they also include topics about <i>Chrome</i> , <i>Financial Crisis</i> , <i>Gadgets</i> , <i>Ad-Blocks</i> , <i>plug-ins for FF (and FF in general)</i> , <i>Linux</i> , and <i>Habr itself</i> .  Copy-paste and the absence of habrokat are terribly tired, but this is difficult to attribute to the topic topic. <br><br>  And in conclusion I want to present a small parody, which should prevail over a negative attitude towards myself.  Please treat her like a banter. <br><br>  <i>Artemy Andreevich Lebedev <sup>TM</sup> once sat in his office and reflashed his iPhone 3G.</i>  <i>‚ÄúWhat a shit this iPhone‚Äù - he thought - ‚Äúcouldn‚Äôt they be able to do it right away?</i>  <i>And also Apple!</i>  <i>But then they knocked on his office.</i> <i><br></i>  <i>- Enter!</i>  <i>- loudly said Artemy Andreevich <sup>TM</sup> .</i> <i><br></i>  <i>Door opened.</i>  <i>On the threshold stood the Norwegian-Forest with some papers in their hands.</i> <i><br></i>  <i>- God, what is it?</i>  <i>- exclaimed Norwegian-Forest.</i> <i><br></i>  <i>- iPhone 3G - Artemy Andreevich <sup>TM</sup> answered without interrupting his occupation.</i>  <i>And then he added: - He did not meet expectations.</i> <i><br></i>  <i>- No, here it is!</i>  <i>- The Norwegian-Lesnoy showed me the device with which Artemy Andreevich <sup>TM reflashed</sup> his iPhone 3G.</i> <i><br></i>  <i>- And this?</i>  <i>This is my new Asus Eee PC.</i>  <i>- Artemy Andreevich <sup>TM</sup> answered calmly and unfolded a subnotebook to the Norwegian-Forest subnotebook, on the screen of which the Leprozoria page was opened in the open Google Chrome browser and added:</i> <i><br></i>  <i>- You know the news?</i>  <i>I became president of leprosy!</i> <i><br></i>  <i>‚ÄúWhere's your Mac?‚Äù</i>  <i>- from the voice of the Norwegian-Lesnoy, it was possible to assume that he had lost faith in life.</i> <i><br></i>  <i>- Sold.</i>  <i>- Artemiy Andreevich <sup>TM</sup> responded.</i> <i><br></i>  <i>- But ... How? .. Why? ..</i> <i><br></i>  <i>Artemy Andreevich <sup>TM</sup> shrugged:</i> <i><br></i>  <i>- A crisis‚Ä¶</i> <i><br><br></i>  <i><b>UPD:</b> Well, why did I lower my karma?</i>  <i>I had 8 in the morning, and now it is -2, and it is not clear why.</i>  <i>Raise my karma, so that I can still publish more articles on the topic ‚ÄúUFO Phenomenon on Habr√©‚Äù and a survey on the topic ‚ÄúHow many dumplings are eaten per week by the average Habrachelovek.‚Äù</i> <i><br></i> <br><br>  The end of the article.  :-) <br><br>  PS: My horse is watching you,%% username.  And she won't get tired of it soon :-) </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/42594/">https://habr.com/ru/post/42594/</a></p>
