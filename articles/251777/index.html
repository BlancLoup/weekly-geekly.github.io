  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Feedback of the PVS-Studio team on the C ++ Russia conference, 2015</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/17e/05d/d75/17e05dd7529f2c498c11191340a38e1a.png" align="left"><br>  Two and a half hours on the train is a great time to write thanks to conference organizer Sergey Platonov (@sermp) and his team for finally having a C ++ conference in Russia!  Sergey's merits are truly impressive, given that he did not have the budgets of Microsoft and Intel.  However, it turned out that the main thing is not the budget, but the desire and enthusiasm.  Therefore, the speakers collected by Sergey were beyond all praise, foreign guests were extremely sociable and kind.  And at the stands of JetBrains, IncrediBuild, Kaspersky and PVS-Studio gathered not talking heads, but professionals, with whom it was interesting to talk to guests and neighbors on the stand.  Our personal impressions are under the cut. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  So, the conference was held on February 27-28, 2015 at the Izmailovo-Alpha Hotel.  We (Evgeniy Ryzhkov <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/users/evgeniyryzhkov/" class="user_link">EvgeniyRyzhkov</a> and Andrey Karpov <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/users/andrey2008/" class="user_link">andrey2008</a> ) decided to raise the mood of the conference participants, having distributed small chocolates in the morning. 
      <br>
        <script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>
        <ins class="adsbygoogle"
          style="display:block; text-align:center;"
          data-ad-layout="in-article"
          data-ad-format="fluid"
          data-ad-client="ca-pub-6974184241884155"
          data-ad-slot="8945601208"></ins>
        <script>
          (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
        </script>
      <br>
      By the way, if you saw that someone was going not with one or two chocolates, but with a whole bunch, then know.  These are our clients of PVS-Studio, so they were entitled to additional bonuses :-). <br><br>  But before that, of course, everyone had to assemble their stands first. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/d5d/e94/ccf/d5de94ccfd1ea1d14d8f93d72d8c1590.png"><br>  <i>People in the photo as it says: ‚ÄúWhere is the way out?</i>  <i>PVS-Studio! ‚Äù</i> <br><br>  Our stand was the most unpretentious, so we assembled it the fastest and began to help our neighbors. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/240/18c/bff/24018cbffdc46a09267576eda0eb23ae.png"><br>  <i>We are helping to assemble the JetBrains booth</i> <br><br>  Seeing this, one of the conference participants recalled the anecdote (‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know who was there in the car, but Putin works with them‚Äù). <br><br>  At this time, Andrew began from the remaining chocolates to make all sorts of inscriptions on the tables. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/5eb/51f/efa/5eb51fefaafcd2a732d94f5ff426d213.png"><br>  <i>Hurry up to collect the word, until you disassemble the chocolate</i> <br><br>  True, these inscriptions changed rapidly.  ‚ÄúC ++ 11‚Äù turned into ‚ÄúC ++‚Äù, and then into ‚ÄúC‚Äù.  Some hooligans once even corrected it at 1C, but the error was quickly fixed. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/2f7/c3c/7c6/2f7c3c7c6bec110d2bc1fb0ab8133a9e.png"><br>  <i>The most daring were photographed in the mask of a unicorn.</i> <br><br>  By the way, when I was leaving for the conference, the spouse instructed me: ‚ÄúYou there let's not look at the girls!‚Äù.  To which I was skeptical, this is a conference about C ++.  How I was wrong!  At the conference there were a lot of beautiful and smart girls!  That also added benefits to the event.  I took few photos of girls, but I hope you will see their photos too. <br><br>  Now about the reports.  The event program is available on the website, the video will be soon too  Guys, just do not rush the organizers with the video.  First, they need to rest.  Secondly, the video must be processed.  It takes time.  Soon everything will be.  Do not write: "Hurry, hurry!".  Reports all where I could go, were great.  This happens very rarely, apparently the narrow focus of the conference allowed to do this. <br><br>  Andrei's report ‚ÄúThe Price of Error‚Äù was on Saturday at 10 am (the very first).  When we approached the hall, we saw a queue of several hundred people !!!  Five minutes later, the voice of a woman: ‚ÄúWho gives up IELTS - we stand in line‚Äù brought us out of the stupor, and we went to our gym.  However, by the beginning of the story, there were a lot of guys in our room.  I will not praise Andrei, otherwise he will be arrogant.  But judging by the questions at the end and the conversations in the lobby, people were interested.  Watch the video, you say. <br><br>  What is my personal impression of communicating with people?  Finally, people already know what static analyzers are.  Many have tried, someone is starting to implement.  In general, this suggests that already in the development system, this concept begins to enter.  Yes, often there is a misunderstanding of the leadership and the lack of a budget for tools like ours.  Guys, convince bosses that tools are needed for programmers.  Convince not for us - we will earn our money on Europe and the USA.  Convince for yourself, because the introduction of tools into the development process (I‚Äôm not even talking about PVS-Studio) - this primarily enhances your personal level of professionalism.  Believe me, the bosses are not fools.  They just need to help make the right decision, convince, show the benefits of implementation.  And then they will willingly find budgets, and you will be able to write in your resume that you have implemented this or that tool in the process of developing your team. <br><br>  What are my comments on the conference?  There were no global problems or shortcomings.  Sergey is a great organizer! <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/3e7/216/955/3e721695540493fd8a3129fc76088eb0.png"><br>  <i>The public approves of Sergei!</i> <br><br>  And small suggestions for improvement (you can always do better) will be sent to your personal mail.  Sergey, thank you for your work! </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/251777/">https://habr.com/ru/post/251777/</a></p>
