  <section class="page js-page"><h1>How I ‚Äúwrung out‚Äù The new iPad from re: Store</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  What do you feel when you go to buy a good thing?  Joy, bitterness, and someone sadness.  I felt something in between, on the one hand - I was happy, on the other - I was sad about spending and there was a feeling that I would not be able to buy without problems. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  First of all, I went to re: Store, which is located in the June shopping center, having called at the same time by phone and specifying the availability of iPad 16GB Wi-Fi.  I asked to postpone one thing, because  according to the manager was no more. <br><br>  Half an hour later I was already entering re: Store, came up saying hello and said that I had asked for the iPad to be put off.  The manager took out a treasured box with an inscription "Alexander" from under the table.  Asking him to open it for verification, I told him that I was not very lucky to be married and that I had already changed iMac and MacBook Pro. <br><br>  Well, well, I did not deceive, and by turning on the iPad, I immediately saw 3 gray spots on a white background in the lower right corner - broken pixels.  Wry grinned and asked to give me without marriage.  The manager made a sour face, got another one (although he spoke on the phone, that there was no more), connected Wi-Fi and handed it to me.  After carefully examining the screen, I was delighted, because he was normal!  But my wife advised me to look at the presence of mechanical damage, and then there was a failure! 
      <br>
        <script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>
        <ins class="adsbygoogle"
          style="display:block; text-align:center;"
          data-ad-layout="in-article"
          data-ad-format="fluid"
          data-ad-client="ca-pub-6974184241884155"
          data-ad-slot="8945601208"></ins>
        <script>
          (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
        </script>
      <br>
      The lid had two deep scratches, to which I again pointed out to the manager, they say, and this is defective.  Thinking that the damage could have been a consequence of the blow and having estimated that I had no desire to prove that it was not me who caused them, and I simply did not want to buy a twisted iPad, I again asked to get another one.  And then a bummer was waiting for me, the iPads were over (why did I believe again?), And the manager offered me a top-end iPad model (36,490 rubles), I didn‚Äôt notice the mockery and we went outside. <br><br>  Being a little upset, I decided to try my luck in another store - re: Store on Nevsky 147. After calling and specifying the number (according to the manager, they had 3 pieces), I reached the store in 10 minutes.  When I entered the store, I heard a greeting, just like in the original Apple Store. <br><br>  I went to the counter and asked me to get the iPad that was reserved for me, telling about the failure in the June shopping center (this was my first mistake).  The managers shook, pawed, pulled out and activated the iPad for me.  Again, the tedious verification procedure began, and again I was ‚Äúlucky‚Äù!  Under the screen was a speck of dust.  Bummer, I thought.  He showed the manager, after which he tried to convince me that there was nothing wrong with that, to which I reasonably noticed, since there was dust there, the technical process of the assembly was broken and it is not known what problems might await me in the future. <br><br>  Many people at this place may accuse me of picking on me, but in this case I buy a PCT device precisely because I want to have high-quality and field-proven equipment, and I don‚Äôt want to have any problems with repairs later. <br><br>  Once again I asked to get a new iPad, hoping that I could not get a defective tablet four times in a row?  Naive, yes?  And here thunder struck!  I was told that they would not open the iPad to make sure there were no defects, because  An open iPad is no longer new and should not be sold. <br><br>  When I remarked that a marriage could not be sold anyway without making a discount, I was told that they would not sell me an iPad at all.  Sailed, interesting ending, is not it?  And this is Apple Premium Reseller!  Within three years I bought the equipment from them and received an honorary client card. <br><br>  But this is not the final, it is only the beginning!  I was angry.  How so, why I refuse to want to buy a non-defective iPad?  I naturally asked for the number of the senior manager and, having received Sergey‚Äôs phone, I went to call him.  I phoned quickly, five beeps did not pass.  Sergey described the situation of trying to buy an iPad in two stores and received an answer that the dust under the screens is a very frequent case, he will now call the store and figure it out. <br><br>  Delighted (I wrote that naive?), I went to watch the MacBook Pro and wait for the moment when they call me and give me the opportunity to buy an iPad. <br><br>  It took 15 minutes, I wrote a letter to feedback@re-store.com and tried to call Sergei.  As many have already guessed, I could not get through this time, it was busy for me, and my wife just didn‚Äôt pick up the phone for the phone. <br><br>  The end?  Not!  After all, I have already spent 5 hours of my time and was angry!  Having opened the Law of the Russian Federation on Consumer Protection on my wife‚Äôs phone and turned on video recording on the Galaxy Nexus, we went to the counter, I again asked to sell the iPad 16GB Wi-Fi and said that they couldn‚Äôt refuse to sell the goods to me under the trade law ( 492 of the Civil Code), to which I was told that the goods are no longer there! <br><br>  Well, suppose that he really isn't, although there was no one in the store before me, and I was told about 3 pieces in stock.  I asked for another model, the iPad 32GB Wi-Fi, while the manager was hesitating at the computer, I explained to him that he could refuse to sell me, what I would have video proof of and I would just solve the problem differently, through the Federal Service for Supervision and Control and also humanly told him that if there is an iPad without defects, then I will buy it, right here. <br><br>  After thinking about something, the manager decided to bring me an iPad 32GB Wi-Fi.  It‚Äôs not so interesting anymore, yes, I found two broken pixels on it, but since these pixels are almost invisible in normal use, I agreed to take it (or maybe because I was just very tired).  Here is my story coming to an end. <br><br>  To say that I am surprised - to say nothing.  How can you refuse to sell non-defective goods, how can you spoil it with others (buyers came and they sold the iPad 16GB Wi-Fi, although there were no more besides defective models)?  And this is a well-known re: Store store, not VasyaPupkin LLC. It sells Eppol ... It is sad and insulting to me. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/146265/">https://habr.com/ru/post/146265/</a></p>
