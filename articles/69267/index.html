Or its brake | MTS vs life:) |</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Since I study such areas of knowledge as marketing, advertising, social viruses with great interest, I have a few complaints about those who create advertising that we watch on TV every day.  We will talk about this, as well as consider some errors and inconsistencies of advertising makers. <br><br>  Yes, another moment.  I do not translate articles from English (Chinese, German, French, etc.) to the topics I write.  Everything described below - my thoughts.  I want - I set out in my blog, I want - I keep it in myself.  You have the right to agree in whole or in part, but you have the right to disagree, and if you disagree and express your disagreement with arguments and without rudeness, then do not apologize, and then for a short time that I write here, many people, expressing thoughts , other than mine, immediately apologize.  Do not. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  So. <br><br>  Frankly speaking, before undertaking the creation of advertising, it is necessary to find out from the Customer, <u>what does he expect to receive from advertising</u> ?  There are lots of options.

      <b>1. Increased sales of a product or service.</b> <b><br><br></b>  <b>2. Promotion or creation from brand zero or TM</b> <b><br><br></b>  <b>3. Hidden PR</b> <b><br><br></b>  <b>4. Black PR competitors</b> <b><br><br></b>  <b>5. Increase loyalty to the Company, brand, product</b> <br><br>  etc. <br><br>  The next point is the <u>budget</u> .  Based on it, you can plan the scale and quality of advertising.  Strictly speaking, the point of view "the more the dough, the more effect" is not true.  Quite a few examples of unsuccessful advertising campaigns with a huge budget and vice versa.  However, the budget must be planned in advance. <br><br>  <u>Promotions of competing companies</u> .  Without taking into account this segment, it is impossible to competently build a strategy and model for conducting the Republic of Kazakhstan.  Below we consider a good example of 2 advertising companies that failed in my opinion as an illustration. <br><br>  <u>Target audience</u> .  You can not do advertising for all.  Rather you can.  But in my opinion inappropriate.  To try to please everyone, to chase two hares, to sit on two chairs ... A lot of popular wisdom is found in the life situations associated with these phrases. <br><br>  The promised example of unsuccessful RCs who spend MTS and Life :) in Belarus. <br><br>  Best, the state-owned mobile operator, was sold to a Turkish company and, after that, actively promoted on television under the name life :).  Characteristically, MTS was actively involved in the fight for the audience, and there was such a moment. <br><br>  <u>1. Both companies are actively using red color in logos and commercials.</u> <br><br>  For a TV viewer, ‚Äúnot watching‚Äù on a TV screen during an advertisement is typical, as a rule, at this time, people go to the kitchen, make tea, and talk among themselves.  Therefore, the maximum that they can grab is the color scheme, slogans (and even then not always) and a certain subject, the general meaning of the Republic of Kazakhstan, such as free minutes or no subscription fee.  And here I was faced with the fact that there was confusion in dealing with many of my friends.  Many people thought that the advertisement that life :) actively used was an advertisement for MTS.  Or vice versa.  Disputes were fierce and stopped after a special viewing of advertising.  The answer was a small logo somewhere in the corner of the TV screen, etc. <br><br> <a href="http://www.save-img.com/v.php%3Fid%3Da9f732cfa6b1746a6171be9627ce75a3"><img src="http://www.save-img.com/pic_s/a9f732cfa6b1746a6171be9627ce75a3.jpg"></a> <br><br>  <u>2. In addition to the color gamut, these RCs are united by the same aggressive strategy and a very large number of hits.</u> <br><br>  And if the viewer suddenly determined for himself that this MTS advertisement is so active and brightly red, then everything submitted in a similar style will be perceived as an advertisement for MTS.  By the way, I myself just recently looked at the video, where the main character is the guy from the photo below (the slogan "Lucky! Now it's all free again!").  As it turned out, this is an advertisement for MTS.  And I have been naive for several months already, thinking that he is the face of life :) By the way, both characters from the commercials of these RCs are chosen in such a way that they have a lot in common in the image and presentation of information. <br><br>  <u>3. Since they have the same subject matter - mobile communication, the same phrases are used in the commercials as in one or another operator, i.e.</u>  <u>Free calls, no subscription fees, SMS, etc.</u> <br><br>  So it turns out that there is a lot of noise, an incredible amount of money rushes into advertising, advertising makers are also satisfied, and there is so much confusion in their minds that it is not clear whose advertising these companies are paying for: their own or competitors. <br><br><img src="http://foto.rambler.ru/public/wearbo/_photos/MTS_legko_skazat_second_edotion/MTS_legko_skazat_second_edotion-web.jpg"></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/69267/">https://habr.com/ru/post/69267/</a></p>
