  <section class="page js-page"><h1>HP and Microsoft - a symbiosis of progress</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  HP traditionally presents a very wide and detailed range of products.  In particular, this also applies to the production of servers, which will be discussed in this article.  We will look at how different HP ProLiant systems work with different Microsoft operating systems in order to provide users with the perfect solution. <br><br>  Servers of the so-called "initial" level are represented by models ML110 and DL120.  The designations ‚ÄúML‚Äù and ‚ÄúDL‚Äù mean the configuration of the system: ML is a tower type, DL is a rack.  The numbering system indicates the model level and the system manufacturer, for example, as presented in our case, ‚Äú0‚Äù at the end of the number indicates the production of the Intel system (systems are also created and based on AMD - the number ‚Äú5‚Äù at the end of the number).  So, ML110 / ML115 entry-level servers in the tower and DL120 cases in the rack format.  Next, moving along the product line, we can climb to the towers and rack modules of the "middle" class ML330 / ML350 or DL360 / DL380.  The ‚Äúupper‚Äù part of the line represents such large boxes as the DL580.  As the numbers increase, the systems themselves also become larger, up to the BL or Blade environment.  This is a very high-tech and high-performance type of systems. <br><br>  However, for the selection of products suitable for a specific user, you need to consider not only the system as a whole, but also look inside the individual product offerings. 
      <br>
        <script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>
        <ins class="adsbygoogle"
          style="display:block; text-align:center;"
          data-ad-layout="in-article"
          data-ad-format="fluid"

      So, ML110 and DL120.  Both of these systems have an excellent combination with the Microsoft Windows Server 2012 R2 Foundation, forming a wonderful entry-level server, known as the ‚ÄúMy First Server‚Äù environment. <a name="habracut"></a><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/bbd/1be/aa6/bbd1beaa646d443a82a40e67af1025d9.jpg"><br><br>  The fact is that the ML110 and DL120 are Intel single-processor systems that support up to 8 GB and several terabytes of disk space (for ML110 - 4 TB).  Options like a redundant power supply and redundant fan available on request, as well as ECC (parity error correction) memory, provide an excellent PC with an entry-level server system and mobile service. <br><br>  ML330 is a model that combines perfectly with Microsoft Windows Small Business Server 2011. <br><cut><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/ef4/5af/aba/ef45afaba23e4cdb97ecd26ca48eab5c.jpg"><br><br>  The result of this combination was a great server optimized for efficiency gains.  ML330 contains a unique system architecture.  This is a dual-processor system, but each processor has a certain number of DIMM slots on the motherboard.  Thus, the user acquires what he needs at the moment, buying, for example, one processor and the necessary amount of memory.  Further, as your needs grow, you can purchase a second processor, which will also allow you to use additional memory slots to achieve greater performance.  All these measures help reduce the cost of purchasing components.  The system supports 8 TB of disk space, more than 140 GB of memory with both installed processors.  There are other distinctive features, such as Inside Control software. <br><br>  Next, we consider the <a href="http://westcomp.ru/catalog/servery_hp_proliant_ml_350_370/">ML350</a> and <a href="http://westcomp.ru/catalog/servery_hp_proliant_dl380_2u/">DL380</a> models, which are perfectly combined with Microsoft Windows Server 2012 R2 Standard and have a significant advantage in both performance and efficiency, including in terms of power consumption. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/fb1/5b8/8d2/fb15b88d24584407aadb82e54b0e27f8.jpg"><br><br>  Both systems are dual-processor based on Intel.  With the latest memory, maximum speed and capacity, each of these systems supports over 190 GB of memory.  They are also flexible: you can install hard drives in both small and large form factors.  In turn, the Inside Control software helps to achieve maximum system efficiency so that you can run extremely high workloads and, most importantly, virtualize them. <br><br>  In conclusion, we can conclude that HP products work well with Microsoft operating systems, and the range of these products is quite extensive.  This allows the user to choose what he needs, and when he needs it.  This is universality in its deepest understanding. </cut></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/265317/">https://habr.com/ru/post/265317/</a></p>
