I would like to direct your attention to the authors of articles, as well as to the value that they bring to the business.  Unfortunately, many people know this area quite superficially, as a result of which comic situations and ‚Äúdisappointment in the power of the word‚Äù arise. <br><br><h5>  Word level </h5><br>  It's no secret that there is a commercial gradation of authors, which is directly reflected in the ‚Äúnominal‚Äù value of their work and the level of information presented. <br><br>  <b>Star.</b>  These are authors with a recognized name who have proven their <s>genius for</s> commercial success.  For example, the fee of Darya Dontsova will be ten times higher than a similar work by an unknown author.  Since consumers are more willing to give their money, being confident in the quality, style, presentation of information and consumer benefits from the product. <a name="habracut"></a>

      <b>Professional.</b>  This is an author known in a narrow circle of people who specializes in writing professional texts on a specific subject.  He almost always remains in the shadows, and his work is transferred to the stars for further marketing and implementation.  In common people they are called "literary blacks".  Professionals for their work receive substantial money, and almost always a line of orders is drawn up for them.  Ps Have you ever noticed that many words of politicians, actors, showmen have the same style?  Probably an accident. <br><br>  <b>Journalist / content manager</b> .  A person working in a specific publication, website, portal, channel.  He writes good materials on his subject matter, if the management allows him and pays for his work.  If not, then the work becomes a routine copywriting, which leads to a decrease in the quality of the material. <br><br>  Most often, journalists meet among young professionals who, at the earliest opportunity, go into the big leagues and curse their old jobs, where they were not paid anything and forced to write operational nonsense. <br><br>  <b>Copywriter</b>  This is a person who has certain developments and patterns in their activities.  At first glance, it gives operational and high-quality texts.  However, they lack ‚Äúrelevant information‚Äù.  For example, the article: "How to buy a car."  A fairly large article is written in which all the information consists of obvious things, water and the absence of specifics.  For familiarization, but for the guide / guide is no longer.  Most often, such people work together with SEO-optimizers and prepare articles not for people, but for search engines. <br><br>  <b>Ts stuffer.</b>  On request "How to make money on the Internet", in addition to Forex, scam and other evil spirits, come across quite funny courses of this kind: "Start your own business: Professional copywriting."  In these courses, people are told that their thoughts and words can be sold.  That there are special exchanges.  All that is required is to get the title and keywords, open a couple of sources and write a summary.  After that, such people are sent to conquer the Internet. <br><br><h5>  Note from VampZ </h5><br>  At Habr√©, not so long ago, a system of selection of authors appeared, which helps companies to find people who will prepare publications in the Habr style.  Obviously, visitors to Habr√© are literate people who simply merge "another marketing text." <br>  Some companies offer to write them an article for a symbolic 1000-1500 rubles.  On the one hand, this is a good amount, but on the other - ‚Äúperhaps not.‚Äù  And that's why: <br><br>  ‚Ä¢ To write an adequate article on Habr, you need at least 2-3 days to figure out what this company is doing.  We do not want to write about a spherical horse in a vacuum? <br>  ‚Ä¢ It will take another week to read the literature on this topic.  And, as a rule, it is in English. <br>  ‚Ä¢ Another day will be spent on the preparation of graphic material, schemes, proofs, etc. <br>  ‚Ä¢ And only then an article is written that has ‚Äúutility‚Äù and has a good effect on the company's reputation. <br><br>  <b>To reduce costs and increase efficiency, there are two ways:</b> <br><br>  ‚Ä¢ Immediately contact an expert in the field.  But then the question arises: will senior-developer want to spend his time relaxing on writing an article for some company for 1000 rubles? <br><br>  ‚Ä¢ Take a person to the state.  If a person knows that he, once having spent time studying the activities of the company, will receive a steady income, the person can agree to such conditions. <br><br><h5>  Content Studio </h5><br>  Recently have become popular content studios that specialize in the preparation of professional materials for sites.  They are ‚Äúmarketing phrases‚Äù convincing in speed, quality.  But is everything really so? <br><br>  <b>The principle of work of content studios</b> <br><br>  ‚Ä¢ Through freelancing or hh they find people who agree to carry out orders in the amount of 35 rubles / 1000 characters.  Sometimes this amount reaches 100 rubles / 1000 characters for complex topics: banking, medicine, engineering. <br>  ‚Ä¢ Studios should have a full-time editor that checks texts for spelling, syntax and punctuation errors.  But it often does not happen, and customers are either sent an unverified text, or sent to a freelance editor for verification. <br>  ‚Ä¢ ?????? <br>  ‚Ä¢ PROFIT! <br><br><h5>  Minute pranks </h5><br>  Turned into one studio, as the author of texts on medical topics.  He took from them an article on the topic: ‚ÄúOsteochondropathy of the vertebral bodies of the thoracic spine‚Äù.  He gave this topic to his father, who is an honored radiologist.  He wrote an article on a professional level using medical terminology.  And in the studio they rejected it, since ‚Äúwe do not need rewriting from the medical reference book‚Äù.  The question is: ‚Äúif they are not satisfied with texts written by a qualified doctor, what do they publish on their medical sites?‚Äù <br><br><h5>  Freelance </h5><br>  The main employees in freelance are ace-pisaki and copywriters.  Most often, they collaborate with SEO-optimizers, "dubious sites" and one-time customers. <br><br>  <b>Feature of the freelancer:</b> <br><br>  A typical customer thinks so: ‚ÄúWe need 100 texts from 2000 characters on tourist topics, texts should be done strictly until tomorrow.‚Äù  Any adequate person will not be able to perform such a volume of work in such a short period of time. <br><br>  ‚Ä¢ The freelancer is sent to the gs exchange, where he buys part of the texts from the gf authors for a penny. <br>  ‚Ä¢ He transfers the rest of the work either to his copywriting partners, or to the gc-authors from gss-exchanges. <br><br>  In the end, the texts obtained have no practical value for the customer, who ‚Äúsuccessfully saved‚Äù. <br><br><h5>  Basic principles of working with authors </h5><br>  ‚Ä¢ As practice shows, anyone can write a good text on a subject in which he understands.  Only a professional can write a few good texts on the chosen topic, taking into account the company's commercial goals. <br>  ‚Ä¢ One good text that goes into the top will provide more traffic and conversions than 200 texts written by students. <br>  ‚Ä¢ If you are not ready to offer decent wages, then your text will be written by schoolchildren, or girls on maternity leave. <br><br>  Best regards, VampZ </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/208862/">https://habr.com/ru/post/208862/</a></p>
