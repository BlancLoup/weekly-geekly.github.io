      EmDrive fans believe that one sentence they found is just quoting this article: ‚ÄúData on the TM212 model at a pressure not exceeding 8 * 10 <sup>-6</sup> mm Hg.  articles derived from tests in direct, reverse, and zero motion, allow us to conclude that the system produces constant thrust with a thrust to power ratio of 1.2 ¬± 0.1 mN / KW (). ‚Äù <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Rodal also announced that the work will be published in the AIAA journal ‚ÄúEngines and Energy‚Äù [ <a href="http://arc.aiaa.org/loi/jpp">AIAA Journal of Propulsion and Power</a> ], a prominent periodical with one of the largest technical communities in the field of aerospace innovation. <br><br>  Eagleworks is NASA's experimental lab, something like Google X R &amp; D, and so far the space agency is not ready to approve technology that many still don‚Äôt believe. <br><br>  Paul March, an Eagleworks engineer, <a href="https://geektimes.ru/post/265230/">posted on the NASA forum several updates</a> on ongoing studies, from which it turned out that many EmDrive tests in a vacuum led to the successful acquisition of thrust inexplicable by external parasitic influences.  And still, many of those who do not believe in this technology, believed that the results of these studies will never be published. <br><br>  In March, the same <a href="http://www.ibtimes.co.uk/emdrive-nasa-eagleworks-confirms-paper-controversial-space-propulsion-under-peer-review-1551210">engineer announced</a> that their work was subject to peer review, but the date of publication was unknown to them, since ‚Äúthe speed of the assessment process is glacial‚Äù. <br><br>  Apparently, the wait is over, according to Rodal, who has long supported the idea of ‚Äã‚ÄãEmDrive, and is building his version of NASA'v aluminum truncated cone. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/72a/537/851/72a537851f71fdd60571206016d21e56.jpg"><br>  <em>Roger Scheuer, a British scientist, who first proposed the EmDrive concept in 1999.</em>  <em>He was ridiculed and accused of fraud, despite the fact that his work was <a href="http://www.ibtimes.co.uk/emdrive-could-microwave-thrusters-be-key-ending-global-energy-crisis-1459997">sponsored by the British government</a> and licensed by Boeing.</em> <br><br><h1>  How does EmDrive work </h1><br>  Roger Scheuer proposed the concept of EmDrive, based on the special theory of relativity.  The engine converts electricity into microwave radiation, which is emitted inside a closed conical cavity, which causes the microwave particles to attach to a larger, flat part of the cavity surface, more force than at the narrower end of the cone, and thereby create cravings. <br><br>  Critics of the idea argued that according to the law of conservation of momentum, his theory would not work - in order to get acceleration in one direction, it is necessary to throw some substance in another direction, and EmDrive is a closed system. <br><br>  However, Scheuer argues that, following the physics described in the SRT, EmDrive actually obeys the laws of conservation of momentum and energy. <br><br>  Scheuer believes that EmDrive can transform the aerospace industry and solve the problems of the energy crisis and global warming, as well as help the development of space travel, cheapening the launches of satellites and ships into orbit.  He is actively working on the start of technology testing on UAVs, hoping to create <a href="http://www.ibtimes.co.uk/emdrive-roger-shawyer-paper-describing-space-propulsion-uavs-finally-passes-peer-review-1513223">prototypes of flying cars</a> . <br><br>  In a conversation with IBTimes UK, he stated that he was looking forward to the opportunity to read the upcoming work of NASA Eagleworks, and added that the thrust measured by them would most likely be very low, the same as he had registered ten years ago. <br><br>  Coincidentally, the nonproliferation law of scientific research, commissioned by the British government, has expired, and Scheuer posted <a href="http://www.emdrive.com/">four of his works on his website</a> , where anyone can learn them. <br><br>  ‚ÄúI guess the Americans will have something to say - but this is not news.  All this has already been done 10 years ago.  If you are interested in rummaging through declassified papers, you may notice that the levels of thrust achieved by us are higher than those of NASA, ‚Äùhe said. <br><br>  ‚ÄúAround the world, people measured traction.  Some comrades built them in their garages, and some - in large organizations.  They all betray traction, there is no great mystery here.  People think that this is some kind of black magic, but it is not.  Any normal physicist should understand how it works, and who do not understand, it‚Äôs time to change work. ‚Äù <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/01a/bcf/d4b/01abcfd4b1846c2ccffa731ca8a17e5f.jpg"><br><br><h1>  Scheuer is already working on EmDrive 2.0 </h1><br>  Scheuer is now <a href="http://www.ibtimes.co.uk/nasa-validates-emdrive-roger-shawyer-says-aerospace-industry-needs-watch-out-1499141">actively working on a second-generation EmDrive</a> with an unnamed British aerospace company, and according to their idea, the new device will have to produce thrust of several tons, rather than a few grams. <br><br>  ‚ÄúWe are trying to achieve levels of thrust exceeding [current] by several orders of magnitude, with a q value for cavities ranging from 1 * 10 <sup>9</sup> to 5 * 10 <sup>4</sup> .  Having reached such levels of thrust, it will be possible to use such engines anywhere, ‚Äùhe told IBTimes UK.  ‚ÄúIn fact, everything that flies, floats or rides today can use EmDrive technology.‚Äù <br><br>  Despite the increase in interest in EmDrive and the upcoming rehabilitation, as well as the fact that in July 2015, his own work on engines for UAVs <a href="http://www.ibtimes.co.uk/emdrive-roger-shawyer-paper-describing-space-propulsion-uavs-finally-passes-peer-review-1513223">passed peer review</a> , Scheuer is not going to publish new works in the near future. <br><br>  ‚ÄúOur work is difficult and expensive, and people who pay for it do not want to distribute it to everyone else, but EmDrive will have a huge impact, and many people have already come up with many ways to use it,‚Äù he said. <br><br>  Recently, several scientists, including <a href="https://geektimes.ru/post/274725/">Dr. Mike McCulloch</a> of the University of Plymouth and Dr. Arto Annil of the University of Helsinki, used exotic physical theories in an attempt to explain the work of EmDrive, and showed that Scheuer and other scientists observed in the experiments coincide with their calculations. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/372629/">https://habr.com/ru/post/372629/</a></p>
