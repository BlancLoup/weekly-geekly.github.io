There are small flaws in the assembly, there is something else, but even all this together does not create in my suspicious brain a spark of a desire to change my e72 to something else.  By the way, now there is nothing else on the market that would suit me.  All rushed into the touch devices.  It seems that the mechanical buttons have become dishonorable devices and all manufacturers are trying to achieve the smallest number of buttons in their devices.  The firstborn and at the same time the leader in this little thing is the iPhone in all its guises.  More precisely, the appearance of all of them is the same, more correctly to say - in all versions.  But back to the topic. <br><a name="habracut"></a>

      So, for a month now I have been actively using the Nokia e72.  Before her, in the foreseeable past, I had: Nokia e61i, Nokia e90 (there were 2 pieces), Nokia e71 and HTC Hero.  So I am well acquainted with the full keyboard of the Finnish manufacturer, Symbian is also not the first day together.  Of all the models, the E72 is most technically perfect, everything is intuitive, reliable and even beautiful.  As for the assembly, my opinion is not unambiguous.  I will say this: if I did not have an e71 before the e72, I would say that the build is excellent, but my telephone reputation is not lucky, because the build in e71 is just perfect (in the instance that I had). <br><br>  The body is well made, but the metal is much smaller when compared to seventy-one.  But more than the HTC Hero :)!  But the plastic in the 72nd is very good and pleasant to the touch, and most importantly - not painted.  The disadvantages include the fastening of the battery cover, which is much worse than that of the e71.  Now the lid is held on one latch, which can be accidentally hooked when removing the phone from the pocket, for example.  I had no such cases, but I heard the reviews.  Because of this attachment, the lid is slightly springy when pressed. <br><br>  Although in general, the keyboard is much more convenient than in e71, there is one unpleasant moment with it.  If it is very fast (very, very) to alternately press the keys, on which are placed both letters and numbers (‚ÄúA‚Äù and ‚ÄúP‚Äù ...), the letters can be eaten.  Nobody prints at such a speed, but the fact that there were no problems with e71 is unpleasant. <br><br>  The speaker is now located at the back.  Very controversial location.  The first thing that comes to mind is ‚Äúit will not be heard if the phone is on the table‚Äù!  After checking, the phone can be heard if it is on the table, since the camera module strongly sticks out and the speaker does not touch the table surface.  If you put the phone on a soft sofa - there is a chance not to hear it.  In the e71 the speaker was on top, putting the phone somewhere else with the speaker down was unreal.  But there is another problem: now you can not use covers with flips, in which the phone is tightly fixed, because the cover itself will drown out the speaker.  Or do covers with not beautiful and not symmetrical hole under the speaker behind.  By the way, on the HTC Hero things are worse: there is a very small speaker hole and is also located behind, only nothing sticks out there, so if you put the Hero on the table, nothing will be heard. <br><br>  Another drawback has become a drawback for me after using HTC: why has Nokia still not implemented the function, so that the phone vibrates when the receiver is picked up on the other side of the connection ??? <br><br>  RAM after restarting the smart - 50 MB.  In the 71st the same figure was a little more, about 70 MB.  Given that the total amount of RAM in both the 71st and 72nd are the same and equal to 128 MB, the question arises: where is our memory?  There is reliable (I try, so that hope would always remain :), that it will be fixed by the firmware.  Although the odds are slim.  However, even 50 MB is enough. <br><br>  The built-in mail client does not want to be configured for any accounts until you configure it under OVI ... <br><br>  So far, no more flaws found!  :) </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/90082/">https://habr.com/ru/post/90082/</a></p>
