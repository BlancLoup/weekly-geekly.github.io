How to identify it?  How to instill the desire to learn and set up for constant growth?  The <a href="http://hopox.com/%3Futm_source%3Dmegamozg%26utm_medium%3Dreferral%26utm_campaign%3Deffect_hopox%26utm_content%3Dhead">service</a> team <a href="http://hopox.com/%3Futm_source%3Dmegamozg%26utm_medium%3Dreferral%26utm_campaign%3Deffect_hopox%26utm_content%3Dhead">for an effective hopox marketer is responding</a> . <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Most marketers are copy machines.  They can create 200 advertisements in Direct on the template, pick up 1000 keywords, scatter them on 50 pages of the site and wait for the effect.  Then the effect is either there or not.  Further optimization is of course possible, but the most important thing happens the first time, or it does not.  If there is no effect, the marketer says: something is wrong with the product and is waiting for its improvement, then again it attacks the direct and seo.  Familiar? <br><blockquote>  <b>Most marketers do not take responsibility for the result and get paid for the process.</b> <b><br></b> </blockquote><br>  But there are others, those who are ready to be responsible for the result and, if not achieved, fight for it to the last.  They already have experience, they are constantly being trained, although nobody asks for it. <br><blockquote>  <b>An effective marketer works for the result, not for the process, and is able to constantly improve this result.</b> <b><br></b> </blockquote><br>  In other words, an effective marketer earns a salary / bonus not for the number of created ads in context, posts in a group or words in the top, but for improving specific business indicators: new customers, number or cost of leads.  In addition, an effective marketer has enough experience, tools and creativity to improve business performance indefinitely. <br>  Do you think there are no such marketers?  By the end of the article you will learn how to grow it in your company. <br><br>  Speaking of marketing tools.  A lot of them.  In total, there are hundreds of tools: analytics systems, search engines, social networks, contextual advertising systems and its optimization, lead generators, CRM systems, mail services, questionnaires, content platforms, video hosting, event registration systems, CMS, user support, affiliate programs and so on. <br>  Establishing effective work in them is not easy, but the main message of the article is the root of effective marketing, not in tools and not even employees, but in the process of employees working with tools.

      The algorithm of how to make high-performance marketers or <br><br><h4>  How to become an effective marketer? </h4><br>  1. <b>Ask the question: ‚Äúwhy are you doing this?‚Äù</b> The answers will not work: ‚Äúthe boss said‚Äù or ‚Äúobviously, it will be better‚Äù.  For each task, ask the question ‚Äúwhat effect do you expect in numbers?‚Äù The answer: ‚Äúto make 200 announcements in context‚Äù also does not work, because we are interested in changing business metrics as a result of our actions, and not just measuring the number of our actions. <br>  For example, if it is a context: <br>  <i>- If you edit the text of ads / bids / connect the context broker, what will change and in which metric?</i>  <i>Is this being done to reduce the cost of the client?</i>  <i>Increase your reach?</i>  <i>How much?</i> <br>  Content: <br>  <i>- If you post on Facebook, what effect do you expect in numbers?</i>  <i>How many views do you hope?</i>  <i>How many transitions, leads or paid customers expect?</i>  <i>Why do you post this post?</i> <i><br></i>  <i>- Diluting content with entertaining contests, what changes are you expecting?</i>  <i>How much will the blog virality, the number of reposts and comments increase?</i> <br>  Activation: <br>  <i>- By changing the texts on the site, which metric and how you want to influence?</i>  <i>How much increase conversion?</i>  <i>How many get transitions from the channel?</i>  <i>Specifically, in numbers.</i> <br>  Product Development: <br>  <i>- If you make a welcome wizard with prompts in the product, the conversion to user-created projects will increase by 5%.</i> <br>  And so on‚Ä¶ <br><br>  For each marketing task, you can specify the expected effect in numbers.  At first it will be difficult, but then it will be easier. <br><br>  2. <b>Write down the expected effect</b> of the task in numbers. <br>  In Notepad, Trello, on the blackboard in the office.  The main thing is to save the data until they can be compared with the result.  The format of the task is convenient to use ‚ÄúIf an action, then a change in metrics in numbers‚Äù.  This type of job entry is also called a hypothesis. <br><br>  3. <b>Collect data</b> .  Stop acting "by eye".  Implement data-based marketing. <br><blockquote>  Data-Driven Marketing is a type of marketing where ALL marketing decisions and actions are based on data about users and their behavior. <br></blockquote><br><blockquote>  Today, 80% of organizations make marketing decisions, not based on data.  At the same time, the remaining 20% ‚Äã‚Äãare in the lead on the market (From the book ‚ÄúMarketing based on data. 15 indicators that everyone should know.‚Äù Mark Jeffrey). <br></blockquote><br>  Collecting data is not difficult.  In most cases, there are enough analytics systems like Google Analytics or Yandex Metrics.  It is necessary to use UTM-tags, for the analysis where the user came from, and goals, for the analysis of perfect actions. <br><br>  4. <b>Discuss the findings of the</b> whole team and write them down.  This is the most important action that will train marketers.  Never books will not teach marketing as real cases.  It is a pity that we rarely draw conclusions.  It's time to fix it.  Try to answer the following questions: What prevented reaching the goal?  How to improve the hypothesis?  How to deploy a test for another channel, value proposition, functionality? <br><br>  These four simple steps form the process of creating an effective marketing department.  Formulate tasks as hypotheses with indication of the expected effect in numbers, systematize hypotheses, collect data and draw conclusions.  This is the Build-Measure-Learn cycle from Eric Rees's Business From Scratch book. <br>  To systematize hypotheses, you can use Trello or a board in the office with columns from the HADI cycle. <br>  Hypothesis - a list of tasks with expectations in numbers. <br>  Action - tasks that are currently being performed. <br>  Data - tasks for which data is collected. <br>  Insight - completed assignments for which conclusions were made and recorded. <br><br>  But the title of this article was different) <br><br><h5>  <b>How to identify an ineffective marketer?</b> </h5><br>  The method of elimination.  Ask him what effect in numbers does he expect?  Ask to draw conclusions from the previous assignment.  Make the task systematize in the form of hypotheses.  If he wakes hiss like a vampire in the sunlight, then drive him to the neck) <br><br><h5>  <b>Where to begin?</b> </h5><br>  Try to start the process of continuous learning and development in your company.  Simplify this process will help specialized tool for effective teamwork marketers - hopox.  He binds the result of the performance in numbers to the tasks. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/1e1/640/bdc/1e1640bdc6d841898e09cc4ad77a15b3.png"><br><br>  hopox is a board with tasks (hypotheses), where the user sets criteria for the success of a task in advance, and the result of the execution is analyzed by the service itself, automatically loading data from various third-party tools. <br><br>  The service allows you to <b>control the work of marketers,</b> not only at the process level, but also the results.  You will always know who does what and what effect to expect from it. <br><br>  hopox instills a culture of <b>continuous learning</b> on the results of their own actions, when each new task contains the experience of all previous ones.  Marketers fall into the inevitable cycle of their own learning. <br><br>  <b>Automatic collection of data</b> from various marketing tools and analytics systems simplifies the process of converting various data and does not allow employees to distort or manipulate them. <br><br>  Check the effectiveness of the team for two weeks of free access to <a href="http://hopox.com/%3Futm_source%3Dmegamozg%26utm_medium%3Dreferral%26utm_campaign%3Deffect_hopox%26utm_content%3Dend">hopox</a> . <br><br>  Write in the comments, what tools or techniques do you use to increase the effectiveness of the work of marketers? </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/298296/">https://habr.com/ru/post/298296/</a></p>
