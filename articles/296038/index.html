  <section class="page js-page"><h1>11 tools for remote control of Webstudio</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Today, all businesses and areas either follow the path of optimization and simplification, or go in the wrong direction, this is a fact.  Any additional costs entail spending extra money and precious time.  If you can translate something online, they do it immediately.  Using the example of WebStudio, I want to tell how you can conduct successful operations in a fully cloud-based company.  Some of the tools about which I‚Äôll talk about relate specifically to the IT field and help optimize the work of WebStudio, SEO companies and Internet agencies, but other tools will drastically change the style of doing business in any field.  This article will be useful for beginner businessmen who are just starting or intending to begin their journey, as well as experienced managers.  Without further ado, let's get started! <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/5b1/e42/246/5b1e4224617c40708ba0464f84dacc40.jpg"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  1. Any business that goes into people, begins with the registration of the company and accounting services.  We come to the aid of the service <b>Myelolo</b> .  It allows online to prepare the necessary documents for the registration of the individual entrepreneur or limited liability company, and in the course of further activities, you can always invoice online, calculate and pay taxes and pay fixed fees.  No where not to go, you can do everything online.

      2. Marketing - the face of the company, it is very important that all incoming applications be processed, so that every potential client receives due attention.  For this we use <b>amoCRM</b> .  I will not talk about sales funnels, I will tell in simple words.  The system allows you to remember each client on time, you will always have information about who is waiting for a commercial offer, who is waiting for a call from you to say Yes, and who wants you to be reminded of yourself right away. <br><br>  The company is ready and the marketing has worked perfectly.  There were orders that are important to perform efficiently and on time. <br><br>  3. To control the execution of tasks and projects, we use <b>PTYSH</b> - the simplest and most convenient program in the style of ‚ÄúTasks and Projects‚Äù.  The system is suitable for any industry where it is required to complete the job on time, and for SEO companies and WebStudies it has convenient solutions and functions, such as ready-made SEO checklists developed with market experts, access fields for websites, fixing the cost of a task for working with freelancers and much more.  The system supports absolutely any cloud storage to share files and works fine in all browsers and on all possible devices. <br><br>  4. To share files in the company, everyone has a Dropbox account, its use is more of a habit.  There are a lot of analogs, but we managed to get used to it.  Therefore, I will not focus on cloud storage. <br><br>  5. If you need to fix something in the code, any programmer can always use the <b>odeanywhere</b> service, it‚Äôs like a great notebook with FTP and SSH functions, which also works great in any browser.  No need to download FTP clients, execute the code directly in the browser and monitor the change history.  (By the way, a very relevant application for Chromebook owners) <br><br>  6. For total control over remotely working staff members, we use the <b>Yaware</b> program ‚Äî a tool that allows us to monitor hours worked and productivity.  In this case, the system disciplines employees by taking screenshots of the screen.  This allows you to be productive and not be distracted by personal items during working hours. <br><br>  7. Separately, I want to mention telephony  Here we use the <b>Zadarma</b> service.  It is an inexpensive and highly functional solution.  voice greetings, redirects and all the possibilities of a real PBX in your browser.  If you receive a call to the marketing department, which must be transferred to a technical specialist, this can be done in one click.  In this case, it does not matter that the employee from the marketing department is now in St. Petersburg, and the technical specialist works from a hotel in the Philippines.  An important condition in the company is to always be in touch during working hours, regardless of where you are located, this allows you to quickly resolve important issues, and employees are not tied to the office.  Therefore, now the employees of our company are already working on different continents. <br><br>  8. Another way of online communication that is used in the company is Telegram.  Who does not know what it is?  I think everyone knows.  His task is simple, but very important - operational communication.  Including a general chat in which every employee understands that he is not alone, we are many and we all work on one important goal.  We can share a joke or discuss important issues with everyone at once.  This is convenient, and the cross-platform system makes it possible not to depend on the device on which you work, it can be anything. <br><br>  9. As a system for automating reporting for SEO projects, we use the <b>SE Ranking</b> system to avoid employee intervention in generating reports on positions, she will calculate the number of days for a request in TOP and based on this will form the final cost.  The system also allows you to prepare more complex, technical error reports on sites. <br><br>  10. A bank is an integral part of any commercial activity.  It should be reliable, comfortable and as cloudy as we are.  Today we use <b>Tinkoff Bank</b> for payroll projects.  We look forward to when they open a cash service. <br><br>  11. In a <b>web studio,</b> there always comes a moment when the number of work begins to exceed the number of resources and at such moments <b>Freelance</b> comes to our aid.  Experience has shown that a responsible executive can be found here quite quickly.  It is important.  With the performers who are doing great and fast, we are trying to consolidate the relationship and work on an ongoing basis.  There are guys who move to our headquarters. <br><br>  In remote management, the most important thing is to establish communication between managers and customers, as well as within employees.  If the reaction speed is fast, then the most terrible remote control barrier is removed.  The practice of our and many other companies shows that it is not so difficult to do.  And in the long term, it gives tremendous advantages for both managers and employees, because it adds freedom of movement to them and saves time on the way to the office. <br><br>  I hope the note was useful and at least one of the tools I proposed you will adopt and it will make your business better.  Thank! <br><br>  ps I would be categorically grateful if you tell me what you use in your company, I'll take note of myself! <br><br>  <b>Instruments:</b> <br>  <a href="http://www.moedelo.org/Referal/Lead/27712%3FtargetUrl%3Dwww.moedelo.org">https://www.moedelo.org/</a> <br>  <a href="https://www.amocrm.ru/">https://www.amocrm.ru/</a> <br>  <a href="https://ptysh.ru/">https://ptysh.ru/</a> <br>  <a href="https://db.tt/bpTTjC3H">https://www.dropbox.com/</a> <br>  <a href="https://codeanywhere.com/">https://codeanywhere.com/</a> <br>  <a href="http://yaware.ru/">http://yaware.ru/</a> <br>  <a href="https://zadarma.com/ru/">https://zadarma.com/ru/</a> <br>  <a href="https://telegram.org/">https://telegram.org/</a> <br>  <a href="http://seranking.ru/">http://seranking.ru/</a> <br>  <a href="https://www.tinkoff.ru/business/%3Finvite_code%3D781434271284">https://sme.www.tinkoff.ru/</a> <br>  <a href="http://freelansim.ru/">http://freelansim.ru/</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/296038/">https://habr.com/ru/post/296038/</a></p>
