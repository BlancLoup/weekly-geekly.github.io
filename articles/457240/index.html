Previously, the encryption machine was released in several versions, including commercial use.  The existence of the Z30 version became known only in the early 2000s. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/zaatqmqzC7Y" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br>  The craftsman was able to repeat the principle of operation of emulators in more modern devices.

Both companies will present a designer for older children in the fall, which is designed to create a laptop with a touch screen. <br><br>  The system is called Kano PC, its design is similar to the design of the device from Microsoft, which is called the Surface PC.  The system consists of a tablet with all the necessary electronic components inside and the keyboard into which the tablet is inserted.  The diagonal of the tablet screen is 11.6 inches. <br><br>  In addition, the designer allows you to learn programming, or rather, the basics of programming. <br><br><h3>  The neural network was taught to identify photos processed in Photoshop </h3><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/1f3/d43/2b1/1f3d432b188cff1dfd5d574967f43d61.jpg"><br><br>  The Adobe team has begun work on a project that is being implemented with the University of California.  It is about creating an artificial intelligence that can identify content that <a href="https://habr.com/ru/news/t/456778/">is edited using company products</a> .  This is the first development in the series, the CNN neural network can distinguish between images that have been applied to Adobe filters, not all, but the most popular.  The neural network determines the influence of the graphic editor is almost twice as effective as the average person. <br><br>  In the process of sampling, the developers selected several thousand images from the Web and processed each of them using a script in Adobe Photoshop.
