  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Code of honor</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  I want to write about one of the main things that make my developer life useful and interesting. <br>  I noticed that most of the people with whom I had the honor to work were bound by a promise, some kind of unwritten "code of honor."  It does not quite look like the samurai Bushido, so let me briefly describe it: <br><br><h5>  Code and duty </h5><br><ul><li>  My work is a reflection of my skill.  Personally, I identify it with quality. </li><li>  If I have committed myself to the project and the deadline, then I will do my best to keep my word. </li><li>  This is a matter of honor - to fulfill their promises.  I am ready to make personal sacrifices to keep my word. </li><li>  Obligations and victims are purely voluntary and are guided only by intrinsic motivation.  Additional external pressure is considered a violation of the Code: I am already doing my job as well as I can. </li></ul><br><br><h5>  Communication </h5><br><ul><li>  I openly confess if I do not understand something. </li><li>  Subordination is not important in the discussion of technical details.  What matters is the persuasiveness of the argument, not the position of the speaker </li></ul><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h5>  Asking for help </h5><br><ul><li>  The time of my colleague is no less valuable than mine. </li><li>  I have carefully studied the documentation and FAQ. </li><li>  I am not afraid to ask questions if necessary.  I carefully prepare my questions.  If this helps my colleague, I‚Äôm emailing the gist of the questions. </li><li>  I take notes when they explain something to me and do not ask the same questions twice. </li></ul>
      <br>

        <ins class="adsbygoogle"
          style="display:block; text-align:center;"
          data-ad-layout="in-article"
          data-ad-format="fluid"
          data-ad-client="ca-pub-6974184241884155"

    <h5>  Assisting </h5><br><ul><li>  I try to help the colleague who asks for my help as much as possible.  No matter where, in which division and which group he works. </li><li>  My help is limited only to the project load, or the fact that a colleague began to go beyond. </li><li>  I try to make it as easy as possible for others to use my workings, documenting and structuring my code. </li><li>  Thus, I reduce the work of the person who will use my code, as well as my intervention if necessary. </li><li>  I support new employees both morally and professionally. </li></ul><br><br>  I began to adhere to this Code, mainly working at SAP AG in Walldorf.  And yes, I think that it is universal and not tied to one country or locality.  So why am I writing about him? <br><br>  In fact, this code is clearly aimed at duties that may complicate your life.  If you are the only one who has adopted this Code for yourself - you are doomed.  Surrounding will enjoy your goodwill and your time.  They will use it, which means you will very soon abandon it. <br><br>  On the other hand, when a group of people starts using it, everything changes drastically.  I was lucky to work in such teams, and in such cases I recognized my work as pleasant and useful.  I felt supported, and my working relationship was built on mutual respect and high motivation. <br><br>  Would I expect everyone to always stick to it?  No - we are all human and each of us attaches a different meaning to different points.  I just wanted to write this code as an example and recommendation. <br><br>  I believe that in the future data the Code will be able to significantly improve the efficiency and success of the company. <br><br>  Let's discover our strengths again! <br>  Jens </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/150636/">https://habr.com/ru/post/150636/</a></p>
