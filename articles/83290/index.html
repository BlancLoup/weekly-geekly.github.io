Today I woke up in not the best mood, my head ached.  Perhaps because yesterday I redid the damn cloud of affairs and everyone fell on me just yesterday.  But to you, dear diary, I will tell about everything in order. <br><br>  Yesterday morning, at about 6, my boss called and ‚Äúdelighted‚Äù with the news that I would have to go to the editorial office exactly by 8 o'clock.  Damn sadist, as if he didn‚Äôt know how long I had to sway in the morning, still there would be absolutely no benefit from me.  Well, yes, I sat on the meeting in the conference room, listened to the reports of sleepy colleagues (many people, like me, used to ‚Äúreport‚Äù via Skype while sitting at home), nodded my head three times negatively when the boss asked, ‚ÄúAre we broken?  Will they break us?  Will you fail the publication ?! ‚Äùand dragged into his office, which, as it turned out a couple of weeks ago, really exists.

      You have no idea what kind of torture it is to rake piles of letters laid out by the secretary into inaccurate stacks!  Work, contacts ... Then I was answered to an interview offer.  Finally!  Less than a week later, this bourgeois deigned to order his secretary to invite me to meet his boss on Saturday in the central square.  SATURDAY ?!  WTF ?!  Yesterday was Monday, and the number is to be printed on Friday!  If I want to save work, I‚Äôll have to look for time in the week and drag myself to the big bag myself. <br><br>  You can never dream of seeing on your desktop a pile of ‚Äúpersonal‚Äù letters from your aunt and other relatives from the province with questions from the category ‚Äúhow is her sweet boy‚Äôs doing‚Äù, to which you could answer without hesitation that everything is fine and give to the courier firms ... No, it took me half an hour of the most valuable time at home, yesterday evening. <br><br>  Nobody remembers what happened at the end of last year.  No wonder, after all, the site itself was no longer discussed.  Oh yeah, perhaps it is still worth explaining to descendants what happened.  So ... how did it start?  Ah, yes, it all started is banal - I lost the network in the tablet.  Just think, this is a big deal, the failures were, frankly, not so rare last half a year, a year.  The connection then disappeared, it appeared that sooo infuriated many, but there was no explanation.  Both providers and 3G mobile operators were silent, and nothing sensible was heard on TV.  Only in the network itself suddenly appeared the site ‚Äútheendofdays.com‚Äù, on which was written white and black ‚ÄúThis will be your last bookmark‚Äù.  And that's all.  Such a few words of the creators didn‚Äôt explain much, and since the herd effect on the network was not very weak, the built-in tiny banner apparently did a great job with the expectations placed on it. <br><br>  Indeed, in a couple of weeks the disconnect was already over 12 hours.  But I was surprised by something else - checking email, twitter, facebook and news, it seemed to me that during those 12 hours there was not a single cyber-soul on the network.  As a matter of fact, I could not check all this - the Internet did not become the next day. <br><br>  Everything was organized surprisingly quiet and peaceful.  On television at the same time - 17:00 - a special news release came out in which they said that the channels did not cope with the increased load and went out of order.  They also added that this infrastructure is not subject to recovery, since the same thing happened with the dns-servers, which means that the polls of the sites were ruined.  It is theoretically possible to restore the system, but it will reject its development for 5-7 years, which completely excludes the whole point of restoration.  ‚ÄúAnd darkness reigned over the planet‚Äù would be written in some apocalyptic book.  No, there was no darkness, horror, ruin and marauding.  It was worse - millions of employees of leading corporations like Google, Yahoo, Yandex found themselves in the blink of an eye overboard.  Corporations went bankrupt, of course, and no one exchange could accept such a number of unemployed. <br><br>  Then ‚Äúfreezing of the news‚Äù began, as immediately the inhabitants were dubbed delays.  Of course, now, after all, it was necessary to deliver the footage by couriers, to which many TV companies were not ready.  Later, about a month later, the shares of the corporation, not closely connected with the Internet, but spread around the planet, began to pour in, because neither video conferences nor e-mail was lost.  But e-commerce, oddly enough, almost did not suffer.  Many companies, such as the acclaimed OZON, immediately organized the release of catalogs and began to take orders by phone. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/83290/">https://habr.com/ru/post/83290/</a></p>
