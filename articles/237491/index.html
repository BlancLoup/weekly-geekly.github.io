  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Google insider's eyes</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Hi, Habrahabr! <br><br>  About a year ago I wrote my previous post on Habr√© <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/196748/">Amazon through the eyes of an insider</a> .  I practiced three times in the Amazon company and, there is nothing to hide, I became attached to this company, accepted many of its principles, and learned a lot.  And I saw the company from different sides, because I had a chance to work in Amazon Retail and in Kindle, in Seattle and in California.  However, my goal, starting from the second year, was to practice in Google.  Therefore, when I was finally invited to an interview, and based on its results, I was invited to practice Mountain View as a Software Engineer, I did not dare to refuse.  I spent there three months working in the Gmail Spam &amp; Abuse team.  Unwittingly and unconsciously, I compared life and work on Google with Amazon, which I want to share. <br><br>  Disclaimer: in the previous article I talked about everything as it is without comparisons.  This is partly because little is known about the internal culture of the Amazon.  About Google, on the contrary, everyone knows.  Tell about Google "from scratch" will not work.  Therefore, here are my personal observations and comparisons.  I hope no feelings will touch.

Especially NorCal.  Here you have to surf and the ocean, and snowboarding, and the beautiful beauty of the city of San Francisco, and the best universities in the world, Stanford and Berkeley, and Silicon Valley.  Facebook, Apple, Oracle, and thousands of other companies and startups literally surround Google‚Äôs headquarters.  This is not forever a gloomy Seattle with Amazon in the middle and Microsoft in nearby Redmond.  However, it must be admitted that there is a flaw in life in Silicon Valley, among which I will place exorbitant taxes and exorbitant real estate prices (not only property, but rent) in the first place.  I am sure that those Habrazhitel who live in California for a long time, still have something to tell about the pros and cons, but during my six months spent in the Valley, I paid the most attention to these aspects. <br><br><h5>  About buildings </h5><br>  The buildings of Amazon in Seattle and in Sunnyvale (California) are the true embodiment of corporate politics.  Being less pompous and more comfortable than buildings of the same Orakla and Microsoft, they nevertheless are multi-storey glass offices.  The headquarters of Google are qualitatively distinguished by the fact that the campus of the ‚Äúcorporation of good‚Äù quite strongly resembles university campuses: low buildings that form together a single complex.  Coupled with numerous attractions, such as T-Rex's skeleton, hammocks, slides, bicycles, billiards tables, volleyball courts, etc., scattered around the campus, this complex is a much more comfortable place where you want to spend more time. <br><br><h5>  About the device and offices </h5><br>  If the Amazon in the company's device is all logical, then Google has some "oddities" with it.  For example, working in the Gmail Spam &amp; Abuse team, we were part of Google Social, rather than part of Gmail.  Google Maps, in terms of hierarchy, is a division of YouTube.  I asked about how it happened, and in response I received unsatisfactory stories about bureaucratic and historical reasons.  But here's the salt: in the Amazon, very rarely there are new teams from employee initiatives.  Often, new teams and departments appear on the decision of the higher layers of management, based on strategic plans.  In Google, the darkness of small teams, which were formed from 20 percent projects.  (Explanation for the uninitiated: in Google up to 20% of working time is allowed to devote to work in other teams, their projects, training, mentoring, and teaching inside Google).  With such a huge number of small start-ups within the company, it is hard for everyone to find a logical place in the hierarchy.  In addition, the essence and purpose of some teams change over time.  From here and a small mess. <br><br><h5>  About attitude to business </h5><br>  It contains critical differences between the two companies.  In Amazon, launching a new product or a new department is a matter of market research and profitability.  Yes, Amazon puts its customers first, sometimes against their own interests.  But in matters of company development, all dictate forecasts and prospects.  In Google, as mentioned earlier, thousands of mini-projects are being launched, which themselves have been given to prove their profitability.  Of the hundreds of projects launched, only a few will be truly worthwhile, and 2-3 will set a new trend.  This is similar to two types of resource extraction: intensive (deep) and extensive (breadth).  Google is digging in breadth and no, no, and even stumble upon a pair of top quality diamonds.  We must understand that not every company can afford to bury hundreds of projects in order to find a few worthwhile ones. <br><br><h5>  Paradox and irony, but Google‚Äôs internal search engine is a piece of poop </h5><br>  It really is.  Compared to Amazon‚Äôs internal search engine, the Google Intranet is an extremely disappointing experience.  There are several reasons for this.  Firstly, a naturally emerging question: why not apply the same indexing algorithm for Google‚Äôs internal pages as for the entire Internet?  The answer is simple: the indexing algorithm relies on the fact that there are more links in the body of documents than the documents themselves.  If this is true for the Internet as a whole, then for the Google intranet it is not.  Another reason for the internal search engine slop is the fragmented content.  Often internal pages are documents stored on Google Drive.  And these pages are written - who is in that much.  In Amazon, this problem was solved by a centralized wiki directory, the search for which is much easier to produce. <br><br><h5>  About culture </h5><br>  In my first summer in Amazon, I wrote a letter to CEO Jeff Bezos with something like the following: ‚ÄúHi Jeff!  I am an intern in your company.  You know, about 900 people (interns) gathered in Seattle this summer.  And I thought, why don't you gather us for an hour or two in some large hall and not give an inspired speech.  That would be awesome. ‚ÄùAs was to be expected, this letter remained unanswered.  It would be left unanswered in 99.99% of companies, so there is nothing to be offended by Jeff. <br>  It was nice that Google didn't even have to ask.  Every Thursday, Sergey Brin and Larry Page themselves go on stage at Charlie's cafe on a Mountain View campus and talk about events and innovations in the company.  At the end of the meeting, they answer questions from the internal microblog and ... questions from the audience.  Attend this meeting can all employees of Google, located in the Mountain View.  It is necessary only to take place early in the audience.  Accordingly, to communicate with the all-powerful founders of Google can anyone present.  And this is great! <br><br><h5>  About wastefulness </h5><br>  Oh my God what a wasteful!  Yes, Amazon instilled in me a desire for thrift.  We must understand that Amazon does not cut you in what you need.  But no surplus!  In Google, you are given everything that you need, it would be nice to have, and not need to.  Yes, we are talking about massage, decoration, furniture, video conference robots, etc.  The height of my surprise was to send the whole department for a few days to the resort at the expense of the company - and this was counted as work time, not vacation.  Of course, from a worker‚Äôs point of view, this is cool.  Of course, someone will say that the company is captivating with this, and someone will say that the company really cares about the happiness of the employees and builds the team spirit.  But with the fact that it is expensive and there is no need for this, everyone will agree.  Generally, spending time on Google, and observing its generosity / wastefulness, I wondered if this generosity really was a good and important contribution to the efficiency, diligence and loyalty of its employees?  Does the company really get more out of them and thrive, or does it thrive in spite of despite such expenses? <br><br><h5>  About gyms and sports </h5><br>  Gyms in Google frankly bad.  A bunch of people, old simulators, no iron needed, little space.  Basin is not in principle - there is just what is called infinite pool.  This is such a bathroom, where the water moves against your movement - like a running simulator, just for swimming.  But the wonderful fields and parks for jogging and biking hills just outside the campus.  Volleyball courts and soccer fields are what you need.  I did not try to study with an instructor or in a section, but it's nice to know that there was such an opportunity.  In fairness, I note that in Amazon, by default, there is no bad gym.  But twice I still received a free visit: for the first time, Amazon put me in a hotel that had an agreement with a local rocking chair;  the second time, he worked in a rented office, which was part of the same complex with a wonderful sports club.  I love America for the falling freebie! <br><br><h5>  About trusting interns </h5><br>  In Amazon, interns are not weakly trusted.  I have never come across the fact that I needed to get a special permit to use a special database or service (of course, unless it is paid).  In Google, I constantly had to pry the manager to ask for this or that access for me.  It was necessary to suspend work until they were given access, and sometimes they were completely refused with reference to the fact that I was an intern.  On the one hand, it's good that Google with a sword in its hands protects its information, but this also complicates the work. <br><br><h5>  About equipment, interview, and compensation </h5><br>  In Google and in Amazon, there is a roughly identical set for the developer: a hospital with a pair of development screens and a laptop for mail and rallies.  The interview is also pretty standard: two technical interviews for 45 minutes by phone.  After passing these interviews, the process of determining the team.  Here it can be difficult to get exactly where we would like, since the teams choose the candidates themselves.  But if the goal is just to get into Google, then most likely somewhere, yes determined.  (Attention: this information is for applicants only).  Compensation (the so-called salary and bonuses in the States) is also at the same level in these two companies.  However, it is necessary to take into account that in Amazon you should still spend money on food, when you don‚Äôt have to worry about it in Google. <br><br>  Such is the story, again about everything and nothing.  Internships are a great opportunity to get to know different companies and their styles in a short time.  But the review was very superficial.  Who can make a contribution with deeper and longer observations, you are welcome in the comments. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/237491/">https://habr.com/ru/post/237491/</a></p>
