Surely you did not read special books, did not pass courses or trainings, like "How to get from point A to point B".  However, you perfectly understand that in order to get somewhere, you need to clearly understand what your destination is.  This is obvious to everyone! <br>  Is it necessary for this to know exactly the way?  Yes, not necessarily.  You can always ask someone on the way, buy a local map, orient along the signs. <br>  Do I need to see the road far ahead?  The answer is again the same - no, not necessarily.  The car, moving at night, illuminates in front of itself no more than 70 m of the road, while it is easy to travel hundreds of kilometers per night.  And, as a result, it hits exactly where it planned to get to. <br><br>  Agree, everything that I wrote above is obvious to you.  Even it is not necessary to think too much.

      Then the question is - why do so many people not apply the same approach to planning their own lives?  Apparently, due to too low a height of flight.  They are so mundane that they cannot even see that the earth, it turns out, is round. <br><br>  I appeal to people who want to rise higher and higher, who want to grow, who want to receive from life much more than the majority.  Sorry for the pun. <br><br>  So, the foundation of all the basics is the goal.  This is the first and one of the most important tools in life - no matter whether it applies to business or other areas. <br><br>  If you live without specific goals, you can assume that you are burning your life.  Yes, you may be living for your own pleasure, but as the years pass, it is unlikely that something worthwhile remains for you.  Therefore, try to give at least some time to the question of setting goals. <br><br><h2>  Basic rules for setting personal goals </h2><br><h3>  One big goal? </h3><br>  For many years I have encountered the following phrase in different books: ‚ÄúSet a goal for yourself, understand for what you live.‚Äù  This is a philosophy, but rather a slogan.  And in 20 years, this approach does not produce results.  I needed a specific tool, even better clear instructions: "Do it once, do two, do three."  Instead, all the books in one voice said: "We need a goal!".  I thought a lot about it.  What is this could be a goal, even for life.  Maybe I want to be rich?  Somehow too mundane.  Or maybe I want to be happy?  Somehow even silly, and even blurry.  In general, more than a year has gone to finally understand how to correctly and effectively solve the problem of setting goals. <br><br>  So, the first rule - you should not try to set yourself a single global goal for life. <br>  Instead, you need to think through several target vectors.  The vector implies that we are talking about goals in a particular direction, for example - personal development, business, family, spiritual development.  Within each direction it is necessary to put down several goals, perhaps, of course, one, if you are not particularly eager for anything. <br><img src="http://semiletov.spb.ru/images/goals-1.gif" alt="Target map"><br><br><h3>  Measurability of goals </h3><br>  It is highly desirable that all targets be measurable, quantitative, or at least qualitative.  You should not set abstract goals, like, "I want to become rich" or "I want to work on a cool job."  Instead, it is necessary to formulate goals more specifically, for example, ‚Äúto achieve a salary (personal income) of 50,000 rubles this year.‚Äù <br>  This is a very important goal setting rule.  First, when the goal is clearly articulated, it is possible to mark the moment of its achievement, which in itself is very pleasant.  Secondly, well-defined goals are achieved much faster precisely because you understand what you are aiming for, there is no uncertainty. <br>  Particularly picky readers want to immediately explain that in the previous picture the goals were set abstractly solely for reasons of clarity of the scheme, so as not to load people with specifics. <br><br><h3>  Model "goal-means" </h3><br>  Suppose today you set one of your goals ‚Äúto earn 50,000 rubles a month‚Äù.  Suppose tomorrow you set a new goal - ‚Äúto acquire a new car of a certain brand on credit‚Äù.  Of course, this goal is achieved only after you have reached the first goal, and you have the opportunity to pay the loan monthly. <br>  Consequently, by the time a new car was purchased, the first goal was no longer a goal at all, but a means by which the second goal could be achieved. <br>  Thus, it is necessary to clearly understand that most of the goals are relatively short-term and, in fact, represent only a means to achieve more serious goals. <br>  The chain "goal-tool" is shown in the picture. <br><br>  For example, I want to master the technique of multi-phase sleep in order to spend more time with great attention on the work on Forex in order to achieve the goal of increasing personal income, for example, to buy a new convertible.  This chain can be continued further.  From it, the goal-means model is clearly understood. <br><br><img src="http://semiletov.spb.ru/images/goals-2.gif" alt="Purpose means"><br><br>  In practice, it often happens that we do not yet know otherwise that this goal will become a means.  Nevertheless, you need to be ready and clearly understand that we are growing and we are interested in more serious and lofty goals, and, consequently, the current goals turn into money. <br><br><h3>  Goal calendar </h3><br>  It is clear that different goals relate to different periods of time in the future.  For example, the goal ‚Äúto find a new job with such a salary level and such social conditions‚Äù may relate to this year, and the goal ‚Äúto build your own house‚Äù will most likely relate to the next decade.  Therefore, I recommend using the so-called calendar of goals.  In fact, on the goal map we spread different goals in different directions, and on the goal calendar they are grouped by year. <br>  Personally, I use simple Excel to create a calendar.  This picture shows an example of how your goals calendar might look. <br><br><img src="http://semiletov.spb.ru/images/goals-3.gif" alt="Goal calendar"><br><br><h2>  Instructions for action </h2><br><ol><li>  Sit somewhere in a quiet place for an hour and a half and try on a blank sheet of paper to jot down a map of the targets, approximately as it was shown above.  Try to take into account both global strategic goals and small current goals, tasks, if you want. </li><li>  Put off the map for a while.  Wait a week until you feel what you have written. </li><li>  Return in a week to the map, modify it if you see fit.  Convert it into a calendar of goals. </li><li>  Print out a calendar of goals and either hang it in a place that is visible to you, but inaccessible to others, or put it simply in a secluded place. </li><li>  Once a day, before going to bed, view your calendar of goals. </li><li>  Do not be afraid to adjust your plan if you see it fit. </li></ol><br>  <em>Incredibly, your goals will gradually begin to be realized ...</em> <br></habracut></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/12372/">https://habr.com/ru/post/12372/</a></p>
