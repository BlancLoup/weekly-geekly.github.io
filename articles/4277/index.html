  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Vimpelcom and Warner Music take on mobile content in Russia</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  <a href="http://www.wmg.com/">Warner Music International</a> (WMI) goes into the jungle of the Russian mobile content industry, <a href="http://www.timesonline.co.uk/">Times Online</a> reports.  And immediately with heavy artillery: WMI entered into a coalition with <a href="http://www.vimpelcom.com/">VimpelCom</a> , and the operator has a 45 million audience.  Beginning August 15, <a href="http://www.beeline.ru/">Beeline</a> subscribers will be able to download WMI products - legally protected and probably high-quality. <br><br>  Ringtones, realtones, pictures and video clips from WMI will be sold at market prices.  The price of the ringtone will be about 32 rubles, realtone - 57. For some products they will make a surcharge for exclusivity.  You can download them from the site, wap-site, using the sim-menu and VAS-cards of the content show-window of "Beeline", reports <a href="http://www.compulenta.ru/">"Compulenta"</a> . <br><br>  But there is an important nuance - the western leader is jealous of intellectual property issues, so its content is protected from distribution.  Sharing fresh with friends will not work - DMR (Digital Rights Manegement) technology will be introduced into each file, making it impossible to send it via SMS, MMS, Bluetooth and infrared.  About 400 phone models support the standard - about 70% of Beeline subscribers have this.

      DMR is still quite crude technology.  The project will use its first version, which allows only blocking the transfer of melodies from the device to the device, reports <a href="http://www.mobil.ru/">Mobil.Ru</a> .  However, by October 2006, plans are to introduce a limited license scheme - when purchasing a package, it will be possible to transfer files through ports or SMS. <br><br>  At the same time, the Russian market has a reputation for being completely pirated - in 2005, 90% of the $ 1 billion turnover of the music market was acquired by manufacturers and sellers of counterfeit goods.  The Western partner can not but embarrass this circumstance.  Therefore, Warner is planning to make money on cheap content.  For reasons of Aleksandro Zubillag, one of the top managers of WMI, selling music tracks in Russia via mobile networks is senseless for now. <br><br>  However, Pete Dinetown, another WMI executive, said: ‚ÄúWe are trying to use both carrots and carrots.  You can not only fight piracy, without giving people legal products. "  Warner admits that they were impressed with the success of <a href="http://www.emigroup.com/">EMI</a> , which sold 55,000 ringtones of David Guetta's ‚ÄúWorld is Mine‚Äù in Russia ‚Äî then it became clear that there was a great demand for mobile content in the country. <br><br>  By the way, VimpelCom also offered a proposal for cooperation to the EMI, but the company refused it.  ‚ÄúWe have been told that piracy is highly developed in our country, and they have nothing to do in our market so far,‚Äù said Alexander Izosimov, general director of VimpelCom.  - Nevertheless, we will try WMI.  The growth of the mobile communications market in Russia is very promising, and it is possible that mobile communications will soon become the main distribution channel. ‚Äù <br><br>  These words, at first glance, seem like a verdict to small content providers.  However, some of them may have a chance - WMI may enter into agreements with other companies.  The exclusivity of the deal with VimpelCom is only that the operator will receive some content before others. <br><br>  Promotional services are preparing a powerful - "Beeline", as you know, sponsored the concert of Madonna in Moscow.  The release of the new service almost coincided with it in time.  Within five months after the concert, network subscribers will also receive access to the exclusive archives of the singer. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/4277/">https://habr.com/ru/post/4277/</a></p>
