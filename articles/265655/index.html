  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Thousand and one blister. Search for overpriced drugs</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Recently, the Ministry of Health laid out a <a href="https://www.rosminzdrav.ru/opendata/7707778246-Gos%2520reestr%2520predel%27nyh%2520otpusknyh%2520cen">table with marginal prices for essential medicines</a> , I was not bothered and checked how often these limits were exceeded in Moscow. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/d2a/c0e/b9c/d2ac0eb9cde749d38cb1e5f38ec4a85a"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  The idea was this: to take the prices of medicines that are available on the Internet on <a href="http://med.sputnik.ru/">Sputnik</a> , <a href="http://aptekamos.ru/apteka/">aptekamos.ru</a> or <a href="http://www.poisklekarstv.ru/">poisklekarstv.ru</a> to somehow combine them with marginal prices and see if excess occurs often. <br><br>  First, about the <a href="https://www.rosminzdrav.ru/opendata/7707778246-Gos%2520reestr%2520predel%27nyh%2520otpusknyh%2520cen">registry, which was laid out by the Ministry of Health</a> : firstly, it turned out that all these data were available on <a href="http://grls.rosminzdrav.ru/PriceLims.aspx">grls.rosminzdrav.ru</a> .  They are updated there every day and presented in the form of a neat Excel file.  Therefore, <a href="https://github.com/alexanderkuk/analyze-drug-price/blob/master/main.py">having worn out with a tablet that was laid out by the Ministry of Health</a> , I switched to the data of the GRLS.  Dataset looked like this: 
      <br>
        <script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>
        <ins class="adsbygoogle"
          style="display:block; text-align:center;"
          data-ad-layout="in-article"
          data-ad-format="fluid"
          data-ad-client="ca-pub-6974184241884155"
          data-ad-slot="8945601208"></ins>
        <script>
          (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
        </script>
      <br>
    <img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/a2b/0ee/34a/a2b0ee34ad96446f85cef5ee2baa1c3a"><br><br>  The list of vitally necessary includes ~ 3200 drugs, but taking into account the different forms, dosages and manufacturers, it turns out ~ 20 000 items.  For each, the maximum price is indicated, at which the manufacturer can sell the medicine to wholesalers.  It is important to note here that the maximum price is indicated for the manufacturer, and not for the pharmacy.  On the price tag on the storefront, the value can be much higher due to taxes, wholesale and retail mark-ups, but more on that later. <br><br>  Then it was necessary for each of the ~ 20,000 positions to find the prices that are in the pharmacies of the capital.  For this, I took the wonderful <a href="http://med.sputnik.ru/">Satellite / Medical</a> site and, pointing out one medicine after another, collected all the prices.  200 names could not be found, for 800 drugs there were no pharmacies that would sell them.  Thus, the number of items for which pharmacy prices could potentially be found has drastically reduced from ~ 20,000 to ~ 8,000.  I do not think that this is bad, apparently, the remaining positions are completely unpopular, if they are not found in pharmacies in Moscow.  One can still assume that the drugs are sold, but Sputnik does not know about them.  Maybe.  But, according to my estimates, the coverage of pharmacies at this service is about 25%, which is quite a lot.  If there is no price, then the drug is really unpopular. <br><br>  Then the most interesting thing began, the drugs needed to be combined in forms and dosages.  Naturally, the spelling there is different everywhere, so I had to figure out what ‚Äúd / v / v‚Äù, ‚Äúd / endotracheal‚Äù, ‚Äúd / p / k‚Äù and ‚Äúd / v / m‚Äù are, to take into account that ‚Äú10 thousand KIE / ml "is the same as" 10,000 KIE / ml "and" 1 g + 62.5 mg "is not different from" 1000 mg + 62.5 mg ".  As a result, 75% of the forms and dosages were able to combine, which is not bad. <br><br>  Then I drew for each medicine a small picture of the form: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/c3f/dcf/d7d/c3fdcfd7d3684625913d4fe0fe92af12"><br><br>  On it, each pharmacy price is represented by a blue stripe, the excess cases are marked in red.  For almost all drugs, I observed severe excess in large quantities.  Then I did not know how much to take into account in order to calculate the marginal price correctly. <br><br>  Firstly, there are different manufacturers of medicines, you need to take the most expensive of them.  Be sure to take into account taxes, wholesale and retail allowances.  For example, a manufacturer can sell 30 capsules "Tulosin" for <a href="http://grls.rosminzdrav.ru/PriceLims.aspx%3FPageSize%3D99%26%26Torg%3D%25D0%25A2%25D1%2583%25D0%25BB%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B7%25D0%25B8%25D0%25BD">471.89 rubles.</a>  <a href="http://grls.rosminzdrav.ru/PriceLims.aspx%3FPageSize%3D99%26%26Torg%3D%25D0%25A2%25D1%2583%25D0%25BB%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B7%25D0%25B8%25D0%25BD">or cheaper</a> .  <a href="http://www.fstrf.ru/press/news/1950/">Wholesale and retail markups are</a> different for different price categories.  For Moscow pharmacies for the price category ‚Äúup to 500r.‚Äù The wholesale premium is 15%, retail - 28%.  Therefore, we add to 471.89r.  43%, we get 674.80.  If the pharmacy is organized by a legal entity, and not an individual entrepreneur, then the wholesale and retail markups are taxed, so we add 10% to 674.80p and get 742.28.  In the general case, the dependence of the maximum value on the price list on the marginal price of the manufacturer looks like this: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/961/7b4/8ce/9617b48ce2a34abbab8e623481d69a8c"><br><br>  It is important to note that the pharmacy can not play on the price due to the steps on the chart.  If the marginal price of the drug, for example, 502r., Then it falls into the category of "from 500r.".  It does not matter that the pharmacy bought it for 499 p.  to make margins, as in the category "up to 500r." She can not. <br><br>  Almost all.  It is only necessary to take into account that the prices in the registry sometimes change.  It even happens that they decrease (four bars below the unit in the image below), so you need to deflate the entire registry archive and take the maximum price for the entire period. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/649/d19/617/649d196178b94e1e9ccaddff5db08334"><br><br>  After all the subtleties were taken into account, the number of preparations with excess exceeded significantly and became approximately 5%.  This is a bit and the elevations there were usually small, but I still decided to walk around the pharmacies, check whether everything works correctly. <br><br>  He put the pharmacies with elevations on the map and went into five of them: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/b9a/478/ea9/b9a478ea993e452cbb85525f7d575bfc"><br><br>  In three, indeed, were exceeded: <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/blvYoCHzOtI%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700023,15700186,15700191,15700248,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhgv9-XwtY9f9qSOBBPKeZ10pkWwBg" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  In order to be completely confident and to get achivok for one thing, I dashed off complaints to <a href="http://gorod.mos.ru/">gorod.mos.ru</a> and now there even someone deals with them: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/01e/e00/850/01ee00850e54477f84c6e5271fbcb55b"><br><br>  Then, thanks to Linkov, Yuri and Vasily Pushkin, with whom I met at the hackathon according to open data, I was able to communicate with people who are in the subject.  They went to the Analytical Center under the Government of the Russian Federation, where they are generally not concerned with excesses in general, they are more interested in the general price dynamics.  Were in the Ministry of Health, they did not really like the intonation, nobody wants to fine there.  The Ministry of Public Health and Social Affairs said that it is impossible to determine the maximum price automatically and ‚Äúa special approach is needed for each case,‚Äù they have been doing this for many years.  Representatives of the Association of pharmacy chains and one large commercial network did not believe in the existence of any number of large excesses, they know in practice how carefully pharmacies check the regulatory authorities.  There is almost no place for violations there. <br><br>  Nevertheless, all the developments were arranged in the form of a primitive reference <a href="http://1001blister.ru/">1001blister.ru</a> .  Price data there is presented in a super-aggregated form, because the Satellite, of course, cannot share them.  Mention any pharmacies are missing.  The handbook can be used to find out the maximum prices for drugs that you regularly use.  They say that sometimes pharmacists in pharmacies start offering discounts when you call a legal price limit. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/265655/">https://habr.com/ru/post/265655/</a></p>
