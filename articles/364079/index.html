    <a name="habracut"></a><h3>  The science </h3><br><br>  The device after landing plans to carry out deep drilling on the moon.  Deep - in the sense, drill deeper than all previous devices.  The planned drilling depth is at least 20 meters (the maximum drilling depth at the moment is 3 meters, the operation was performed by cosmonauts from Apollo 17).  This, according to experts, will provide a relatively large amount of information about the breed, which is 4.5 billion years old. <br><br>  And such data is likely to shed light on the origin of the moon and the processes occurring during the formation of the crust, and the processes that took place later. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/423/fdb/ab2/423fdbab2aac7ccf87e7c337317616a4.jpg"><br><br>  If we can get information about the structure of the near-surface layers of the Moon at the site of the vehicle‚Äôs landing, the answer to the question of whether it is possible to build a habitable lunar base can be understood.  By the way, the landing apparatus is planned in the area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe South Pole of the Moon. <br><br>  Thus, the device must receive data to form an answer to three questions: <br><ul><li>  How did the formation of the moon in the distant past; </li><li>  How the meteoric "bombardment" affected the moon and the earth; </li><li>  Is it possible to build a habitable base on the moon (earlier it was the south pole of the moon that was considered as one of the regions suitable for hosting such a base). </li></ul><br><br><h3>  Technical details </h3><br><br>  The authors of the project claim that the lunar module has not yet been developed, but a number of tasks that the module will perform, and the technical details of the project are already known. <br><br>  So, the launch will be made by a medium-class launch vehicle (for example, SpaceX Falcon 9).  On the way to the Moon, the module will be able to adjust the trajectory of movement.  Landing area will be limited to the territory, which area is approximately equal to the area of ‚Äã‚Äãa football field.  The landing module will be equipped with several engines to allow movement adjustment. <br><br>  In addition to the rig, the module itself will have a manipulator, as well as a set of tools for analyzing and studying the landing region. <br><br>  The module will receive energy from photovoltaic cells, the planned power - 0.5-1 kW. <br><br>  Drilling on the moon is a rather difficult task, since the module will have a relatively light drill, plus you cannot use coolant, plus you need to take into account the low surface temperature, plus limited energy production. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/aae/730/07e/aae73007eb6f44ffd4e7a9263b37df8e.jpg"><br><br>  However, the developers believe that they will cope with the task.  Some details of the drilling process are already known.  So, for an hour of work, the project team's specialists hope to drill up to 15 centimeters of the breed.  The diameter of the drill hole is 2.5 cm (or rather, the diameter will be for the extracted samples, their length is 15 cm).  After analysis, the samples will be left on the surface of the moon.  As soon as the set depth is reached, scientific instruments will be placed in the well to study the structure, composition and other characteristics of the rocks. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/364079/">https://habr.com/ru/post/364079/</a></p>
