  <section class="page js-page"><h1>How do we do without 1C?</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  In short - no way.  In all that relates to interaction with government agencies (whether tax, financial statements, any excise payments, etc.), 1C is not replaced by anything and trying to do it, at least, is not constructive. <br><br>  But you do not stop reading this article, this is not the main idea.  The main thing is not to fall into a logical trap and not to count 1C absolutely indispensable in any part of the automation of all processes in the enterprise.  Here there is something to argue with and what to offer.  I want to talk about one successful experience in automating various aspects of a computer company's business activity and, of course, about connecting this solution with 1C.  The work grew out of the need to interface the system developed independently with the 1C program, but this approach (division into 2 program blocks) can be developed to a complete philosophy of building an information system in general. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Initially, the task was as follows.  There was a corporate automation system written in Microsoft Access.  Over the long years of its development, it has absorbed almost all daily tasks - keeping a bank, invoicing, preparing accounting documents for shipment, maintaining a warehouse, keeping track of components by serial numbers, making flow charts for production, etc.  Recently, system capabilities have been added: creating bank payments directly based on incoming accounts, automatically generating price lists in various formats for publishing on web resources, updating the company's website and preparing Agreements based on existing templates (so-called office automation) .  Plus the presence of a large number of analytics and management of all management accounting.  All this made the system completely irreplaceable - transferring all this functionality to 1C would take a lot of time and money. <br><br>  On the other hand, the 1C-Enterprise program served only accounting requirements for managing accounting and performance accounting and reporting.  Thus, 1C was ‚Äúuntied‚Äù from the daily operation of the company, and the documents held were entered into the a posteriori database.

      What is such a good scheme?  There are several advantages to this: <br>  - non-admission of managers and other (without) responsible persons in the "holy of holies" - the accounting base, which must be formed only by employees who have an idea of ‚Äã‚Äãthe subject;  accurate reference guides, <br>  - making out of 1C everything that is not related to it: from managerial tasks that do not require reflection in accounting, to any other issues that are specific to the company and to which outsiders should not have access, <br>  - savings on licenses: 1C jobs cost a lot of money, <br>  - an important point: when introducing all the above-described additional functionality directly ‚Äúinside‚Äù 1C, there is a constant need for its refinement when the product updates are released.  This, of course, guarantees almost constant employment of 1C programmers, but this is a place where you can save a lot. <br><br>  Well, fat minus, of course, is the need to twice carry out all the documents and replenish directories. <br><br>  Actually, this was the main task - to get away from double work. <br><br>  First you need to deal with all sorts of directories - first of all, this is a directory of contractors and nomenclature.  The problem of synchronization of directories, which often arises in programs of this kind, is sufficiently developed and understood in implementation.  However, in this case, a volitional decision was made not to use 2 reference books with mutual synchronization, but to have one initial version - the one that was created in MS Access, and simply replicate it in 1C (feedback is just a mark in MS Access that this position already unloaded). <br>  This approach greatly simplifies the task.  For purely accounting needs, quite a few positions in such directories are needed - and they are also entered into in an external program so as not to violate the formulated principle.  Thus, it is possible to remove one more frequent problem - immense inflation of the reference book of the used nomenclature.  Below is the product group "Monitors" <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/b84/9a1/d31/b849a1d31fc248b8bb9abd0268e07129.png" alt="image"><br><br>  Loading such a horror in the 1C reference book (and new monitor models appear almost every week) can be configured in such a way that they all fall into one position, since the nuances of the frame color around the screen and the number of pixels are completely irrelevant for accounting!  Yes, and the size of the diagonal, to be honest - especially if it differs by half an inch. <br><br>  Further, in the external program, it is possible to work with much smaller losses to merge duplicate positions in directories, especially in the counterparty directory, since in 1C it takes a lot of effort. <br><br>  Thus, only ‚Äúrefined‚Äù, cleared and properly rendered data are unloaded in 1C.  Unloading can be done with a certain frequency - the portionality allows you to debug the work of accounting and avoid unnecessary work, if during the day (or a longer period) something is canceled, changed, performed again - all these things occur in the MS Access working base, and only ‚Äúestablished ¬ªState of affairs enters 1C.  Plus, this kind of unloading can be synchronized with the backup operations and always be sure that the current state of the 1C base is correct. <br><br>  Understandably, documents arrive without automatic posting (although this could be customized).  By the way, the MS Access database itself checks for the availability of the necessary goods in the warehouse - to be written off for shipment (dilemma - to make sure that the invoice can be written out with the current date, that all the items necessary for writing off are in the warehouse - that is, purchased or produced - need ... to post a document in 1C. Apparently, you should not trust this to managers - or else an accounting officer should always stand behind the manager <br><br>  Now about the implementation.  1C programs support the data exchange interface through the ADO mechanism.  On the side of 1C, a regular software interface is used to create elements of reference books and documents, so that the work of this mechanism does not depend on the internal details of the implementation of 1C, which may vary from version to version and from update to update.  On the other hand, the main slogan of the development was ‚Äúmaximize the capabilities of 1C, where it is possible.‚Äù  Therefore, in the final implementation of the bundle from MS Access, only the name and TI of the counterparty were loaded - the data was ‚Äúpulled up‚Äù from the USR and IP reference books using the built-in mechanism in 1C (the same applies to bank details - they are updated according to the BIC). <br><br>  Queries were created in the external MS Access database, which prepare all the necessary data for loading into 1C - take it and lay it out according to the documents and fields. <br><br>  The unloading scheme consists of two stages.  At first, new items of counterparties and nomenclature directories are loaded.  Assigned 1C GUIDs are returned to MS Access, so that when uploading all documents to the second stage, set the correct bindings to the directories.  It looks like this <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/49e/63f/d42/49e63fd425354602b9265a8c2366e1c6.png" alt="image"><br><br>  We believe that such an ideology of building information systems can be taken as a basis not only in those firms that have inherited non-1C systems, but also when organizing the work of new legal entities, since we have great experience in MS Access.  The advantages of this approach are described above. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/267847/">https://habr.com/ru/post/267847/</a></p>
