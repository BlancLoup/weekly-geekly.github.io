  <section class="page js-page"><h1>History of one business</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Good day, Habrograzhdane! <br>  In order not to make this post advertising, let's call it a "hypothetical story of one business" <br>  It all started with the goods.  He was a quality brand known.  Along with him, there were a dozen more, of the same goods: 50% were better, 50% worse.  And there were two people: one former student-philosopher, and the other without higher education. <br>  We tried to sell in any way.  Personally, they made an online store, tried to sell in bulk and be the exclusive distributor in Zapupkinsk.  And then came Groupon, and with it the concept of one product webshop, and we even thought "that's it."  But no ... Skidychny services are really created for services and selling goods there - the strategy is not long-term, I would even say "one night webshop".  Then they invented a game with the concept of buy-sell-get.  But here we need a lot of money to get to the coot.  And finally ... <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  And finally, we realized that the goods are, to put it mildly, ‚Äúilliquid,‚Äù despite all its pompousness, quality and reasonable price.  But it was too late: the bridges were filled and burnt.  But as it turned out, this was only the beginning of the story.  The partner had the idea: ‚Äúwhat if we deduct 10% to the church? So at least we make the devout people buy‚Äù.  The idea, of course, is good, but I am sure that the ROC has money in bulk.  As a result, transformed into "10% for the needs of children with disabilities."  It was not in Moscow.  And it was a bomb. <br>  We wrote in the 10 most famous foundations in the district, which were actively promoted, and so to speak, were "in plain sight."  Answers followed immediately.  As a result, the foundation was chosen, not without the participation of the ‚Äúspear method‚Äù, which we were promoting not with selfish ends.  And at the same time sold.  10% of the check, including delivery, was honestly redirected to the fund.  I will not say how much they sold, but it is enough to smile and sigh with relief. <br>  Accordingly, they made several conclusions for themselves.  Which I want to convey to the general public, to you Habravchane. <br>  <strong>The first and extremely controversial.</strong>  In charity must be its own self-interest.  If you do not want to earn money - you do not earn it.  And without money you donate nothing. <br>  <strong>The second.</strong>  Do not forget about social PR.  When you make your startup, remember: the Russian soul is kind and broad.  Each of us has a desire to help in the genes.  This, of course, must be used. <br>  <strong>Third.</strong>  Under the auspices of the charity it is easier to launch word of mouth or a viral sentence.  Those who are not ready to help with money will fulfill their duty, tell another. <br>  <strong>Fourth.</strong>  As a result, the girl with cerebral palsy still wins. <br>  Successful projects! <br></div>
