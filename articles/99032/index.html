  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Legally correct settlement for contracts through WebMoney</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  I often had the need to conclude contracts with performers for the provision of any services (for example, for the development of a site).  And the performers often need to receive payment for services rendered in the form of WebMoney title units. <br><br>  Finally, I found time to figure out how to combine these 2 desires and now I share my experience. <a name="habracut"></a>  Everything is much simpler than it might seem at first glance. <br><br>  You need to start with a properly executed contract, it must necessarily cover the following 3 positions: <br>  - the full price of the goods in rubles, including VAT and personal income tax, if they are implied, must correspond to the amount of checks sent electronically to the bearer for cashless payments (WebMoney R), hereinafter referred to as ‚ÄúECP‚Äù; <br>  - transfer of securities (ECP) should be indicated as a form of payment for the transaction and their essential details should be indicated, the payment should be recognized by the parties at the time of drawing up an acceptance certificate in electronic form (recording in WebMoney Transfer); <br>  - both parties must recognize the documents in electronic form, compiled using WebMoney Transfer (acts of transfer and acceptance, sales contracts, invoices) and their paper copies legally equivalent to the corresponding documents in simple written form.

      LLC "Guarantee Agency" also recommends to reflect in the contract the parties' consent to make (the payer) and accept (the payee) payment by simple transfer of ECP between Requisites "purses" type R with drawing up an act of transfer certified by the System, but I think that if in the contract there are 3 points listed above and the Parties sign the document, then such consent is implied.  And there is no need for a separate paragraph ‚Äúon consent‚Äù. <br><br>  In my working contract template, the following 2 formulations are used, in accordance with the information above: <br><br>  In the section ‚ÄúORDER OF CALCULATIONS‚Äù: <br>  - The customer sends, in payment for the services rendered, electronic checks to the bearer for non-cash payments, hereinafter referred to as ‚ÄúECP‚Äù, in the amount of 20,000 (twenty thousand) rubles, in parts in 60% (sixty percent) and 40% (forty percent), which amounts to 12,000 (twelve thousand) rubles and 8,000 (eight thousand) rubles.  The transfer of the ECP is carried out by transfer between the Requisites of type R (WebMoney Transfer R), owned by the parties.  Payment is considered to be made from the moment of the certificate of the transfer of the ECP in electronic form by the WebMoney Transfer system. <br>  <i>Comment: hence it is clear that the amount for the provision of services under this template is 20,000 rubles of the Russian Federation (indicated in a separate paragraph), that it is made taking into account a prepayment of 60% and a final settlement upon completion of the provision of services of 40% (also indicated in a separate paragraph ).</i>  <i>Well, and again, a separate item you need to specify that the contractor starts to perform work from the moment of receipt of the ECP in the amount of such and such from the customer to the Requirement type R contractor.</i> <br><br>  In the section "SPECIAL CONDITIONS": <br>  - The parties recognize the documents in electronic form, compiled with the help of (means) of WebMoney Transfer system (acts, contracts of sale, invoices, account statements) and their paper copies, legally equivalent to the corresponding documents in simple written form. <br><br>  WMR-wallets (they are also ‚ÄúRequisites of type R‚Äù) along with WMID were indicated in the section ‚ÄúREQUISITES OF THE PARTIES‚Äù. <br><br>  After signing the document and making the payment (it is recommended to use transaction protection and specify information about the contract in the payment notes, for example, ‚ÄúPrepay 60% under the Service Agreement No. XXX of July 01, 2009‚Äù) the question of confirmation of payments arises.  This is where <a href="https://report.wmtransfer.com/">report.wmtransfer.com</a> comes to the <a href="https://report.wmtransfer.com/">rescue</a> . <br><br>  Order a report of transactions on your wallet for the day of payment under the contract in PDF (if there were several payments, they were made on different days, then generate a report not for the covered period, but separately for each day when transactions took place).  It's free.  Print a PDF in monochrome and send the page or pages to 123007, Moscow, 2nd Silikatny passage, 14, Bldg.  2, p. 14, LLC "Guarantee Agency" with a request for legal certification of these securities.  Reports with signatures and WebMoney Transfer stamps will be returned to you within 2 weeks. <br><br>  Grow, earn, develop! <habracut></habracut></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/99032/">https://habr.com/ru/post/99032/</a></p>
