  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Ability to use the idea: how new products appear</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Ideas are everywhere.  Use them.  Criticizing them and making fun is a kind of "sport" on the net.  The network itself, thirsting for innovation and new approaches, sometimes suddenly enters into controversy with a die-hard caustic commentator who writes completely out of business.  In fact, the transformation of ideas into concrete products is something amazing and magical; this is the very essence of product development. <br><br>  Products are born from the same open-source ideas, tools, and even skills.  Just a couple of steps separates ordinary products from those that become a breakthrough.  To create a breakthrough product, you need to master new paradigms;  these paradigms need to be discussed, argued about them, but first of all they should be used.  It takes courage to question existing paradigms and push new ones. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h4>  Paradigm for discussion </h4><br>  Dear and often published <a href="http://www.cs.yale.edu/people/gelernter.html">David Gelertner</a> in his recent <a href="http://www.wired.com/opinion/2013/02/the-end-of-the-web-computers-and-search-as-we-know-it/">article</a> put forward a concept - the possibility of a new metaphor in the computer field.  This article makes you wonder.  I think this is exactly what the author wanted. <br><br>  In fact, the article introduces a new metaphor, proving the importance of metaphors in the evolution of computer science.  People interact with computers using metaphors - from two-digit numeric displays to dot-matrix printers, command lines, GUI, the web, and now social and mobile ways.  In addition, the features of these metaphors are extremely important and deserve discussion and controversy.

      Unfortunately, as expected, the responses to this post quickly slipped to senseless, caustic comments and all kinds of infusions that were not worth the resources that were spent on their transfer and storage.  These comments were even discussed on Twitter.  As a result, the article, which could give food for an interesting discussion between the creators of the products, turned into a championship on sarcasm. <br><br>  Someone said that the idea is not new.  That the global information flow is actually broadcast by Google reader.  Someone claimed that with Facebook and Twitter we are already in the information flow every day.  Someone said that the idea will not work. <br><br>  I believe that this article is about a metaphor, not about a specification, and certainly not about an application that can be tested and commented on.  The desktop itself, on which I am writing this, was described in the 1945 article "How we can think" ( <a href="http://www.uic.unn.ru/pustyn/lib/vbush.ru.html">http://www.uic.unn.ru/pustyn/lib/vbush.ru.html</a> - approx. Ln.) its author is Vanivar Bush, who then headed the Office of Scientific Research and Development (Office of Scientific Research).  And it is worth remembering that the network itself began with an article by Ted Nelson in 1965 devoted to the metaphor of hyperlinks ( <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertext">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertext</a> - approx. Lane) - outlined in it was implemented only in 1967 or 1993, depending on how you count. <br><br>  Would these articles be the subject of such mockery?  Perhaps, at one time, and steel, but the story rightly forgot the cries of spiteful critics.  We should understand that such publications are what can change computer science. <br><br>  Read them.  Participate in the discussion.  Ignore them if you want.  Not every one of them is brilliant, and not even every one is worth reading.  But there is no point in scribbling meaningless comments on them or discussing them as if they were specifications for planned specific products. <br><br><h4>  Product Discussion </h4><br>  To grab hold of the discussion around the paradigm shift and turn it into a product is real magic.  Few people, in principle, can do it, and very few people do it.  It is very difficult. <br><br>  The product of a new paradigm will, by definition, be different, but not all characteristics will be radically different from the original.  The most interesting thing about a paradigm-changing product is how much the source product will have to be processed. <br><br>  When creating each new product and each new paradigm, we take ingredients from around the world and add them to the ‚Äúprimary broth‚Äù of the development.  The output is a product.  It will never be the same as the one that was taken as a basis. <br><br>  What distinguishes a new, but in fact still old product from one that can radically change our view of technology is a set of solutions, the differences between which can be microscopic.  How is Facebook different from Myspace or Fridendster (or heaps of other sites)?  Were there touch phones before the iPhone?  MS-DOS was one of many command line program loaders. <br><br>  To take an idea and turn it into a product is a great pleasure and at the same time a challenge.  To collect ideas and create a product out of them, you need great courage and, often, a strong faith in the result. <br><br>  Articles challenging the status quo and forcing us to see the world differently is the source for the outstanding achievements we all crave. <br><br>  Using this dialogue is the beginning of the development of paradigm-changing products. <br><br><h4>  Great sunday </h4><br>  Today is a <a href="http://www.kip.ru/realtime/2013/02/super-bowl.html">great football game</a> .  In the film "Every Sunday," Al Pacino's hero Tony D'Amato makes one of the most ingenious motivating speeches in history: <br><br>  ‚ÄúAt some point you realize that in life the game goes on inches - just like in football.  Since in any game - even in life, even in football - there is very little room for error.  In the sense that if you were late or hurried half a step, you lost.  A second earlier, a second later - and did not catch.  And these are decisive inches everywhere.  In every round of the game, in every minute, in every second.  And we with our team are fighting for these inches.  We do not spare either ourselves or others to win this inch.  We rip our fingers into the blood for that one inch.  Because we know that together all these inches are the fucking difference between winning and losing.  Between life and death! ‚Äù <br><br>  Ideas are everywhere.  Components for new products - everywhere.  Only inches separate ordinary products from those that change the world.  Be sure that when creating products, you should always grasp ideas, no matter where they come from. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/171571/">https://habr.com/ru/post/171571/</a></p>
