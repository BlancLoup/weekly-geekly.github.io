  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Magento 2. Le Roi est mort! Vive le Roi?</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"><p>  For the first time with Magento (then still "edinichkoy"), I encountered years ago, 6 months ago.  Since then, so with her and work, with more or less density.  Initially, the post wanted to be called "Quo vadis, Magento?" and until now this question remains relevant (since I even had a desire to use such a name).  Therefore, the post is called as it is called. </p><br><p><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/c8e/82e/8a4/c8e82e8a495b46fabe74471861704010.jpg" alt="image"></p><br><p>  Under the cut, I tried to formulate my own (that is to say, subjective) vision of the prospects of this platform - full of grunts and despondency.  Without detailed calculations.  Without detailed reflections.  Without evidence.  And most importantly - <a name="habracut"></a></p><br><p>  yes, the main thing - without hope. </p><br><h1 id="le-roi">  Le roi </h1><br><p>  In my practice, Magento, perhaps, is the most complex web application I have come across (once again I focus on the <strong>subjectivity of</strong> my calculations!).  Colleague <a href="http://www.subtext-lang.org/AboutMe.htm">Jonathan Edwards</a> once put it "programming is a <em>hopelessly lost fight against the insurmountable complexity of the code and the treachery of the requirements</em> ).  So, Magento in this hopeless struggle advanced further than all the other web-applications I have seen. </p><br><p>  The basis of Magento was originally laid down the principles of adaptability and extensibility: EAV, modules, rewrites, events - these are the mechanisms that allowed Magento to attract many users and, most importantly, developers and take a dominant place in e-commerce.  The main "chips" Magento were and remain not only the wealth of functionality "out of the box", but also an impressive number of third-party modules (paid and free), allowing you to tune the store "by itself". </p><br><p>  Magento became the center of attraction on the one hand of many developers - you could either get a <a href="https://www.magentocommerce.com/magento-connect/catalogsearch/result/%3Fid%3D%26s%3D1%26pl%3D0%26eb%3D0%26hp%3D0%26q%3D%26t%3D0%26p%3D1">good advertisement</a> , make a small but necessary free module for everyone, or get <a href="https://www.magentocommerce.com/magento-connect/catalogsearch/result/%3Fid%3D%26s%3D3%26pl%3D0%26eb%3D0%26hp%3D0%26q%3D%26t%3D2%26p%3D1">good money</a> by making a commercial module for specific customer needs not covered by basic functionality (or covered only by the Enterprise version ).  Now Magento Connect has at least <a href="https://www.magentocommerce.com/magento-connect/catalogsearch/result/%3Fid%3D%26s%3D1%26pl%3D0%26eb%3D0%26hp%3D0%26q%3D%26t%3D0%26p%3D967">966 pages of</a> modules for Magento 1, 10 units per page are almost 10,000 extensions. </p><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">And WordPress has 50,000</b> <div class="spoiler_text"><p>  Yes, WordPress has about <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins-wp/">50,000 modules now</a> , but WordPress is the ‚Äúsite‚Äù engine (in general, CMS plus users), and Magento is the ‚Äústore‚Äù engine (plus product catalog, plus warehouse, shopping cart, orders, returns and all that).  And it is much easier to add an extension for the ‚Äúsite‚Äù - there is little of what is there.  But the specificity of the "store" somewhat limits the <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins-wp/search/games/">possible directions of</a> expansion. </p></div></div><br><p>  On the other hand, Magento also became a center of attraction for users - they immediately received not only a workable store, but they could also choose an attractive topic for it, expand functionality with the help of ready-made modules.  Or order the creation of "their" modules.  Or "his" theme.  Extensibility has been one of Magento‚Äôs engaging marketing tricks.  Of course, in reality, the addition / change of functionality was not an entirely <a href="">trivial task</a> , but nevertheless, such an opportunity was initially added to the platform when it was created and successfully used in evaluative comparison with competitors.  As a result, the number of stores on Magento has reached, by some estimates of 2015, almost a quarter of a million. </p><br><p><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/122/b70/b24/122b70b243d349488c726cf692041430.jpg" alt="image"></p><br><p>  This two-way attraction created a peculiar ecosystem in which various solutions in the field of e-commerce based on the Magento platform were created, tested, taken root or thrown out.  In the first version there was no full-fledged testing, but its absence was compensated by the number of installations - if you use common functionality and do not build exotic configurations, then the probability of encountering errors in the store was quite low.  A certain number of existing <a href="http://magento-forum.ru/topic/4642/">large stores</a> also indicated quite good platform capabilities - at least from the point of view of medium and small businesses. </p><br><p>  In general, more recently Magento was the undisputed leader in the e-commerce market. </p><br><h1 id="-est-mort">  ... est mort </h1><br><p>  So why do I personally look at the future of Magento with pessimism?  Probably for the same reason that they looked at the future with pessimism in the engine room of the Titanic.  Perhaps even Captain Edward John Smith, to whom all information flowed, did not understand at first all the tragedy of the situation, not to mention the passengers, who were convinced by the analogues of the marketing services of the time that the Titanic was unsinkable.  But in the engine room they saw bursting rivets and gaps between the steel sheets, which icy seawater burst into the air, bubbling and foaming, and the unsuccessful operation of the pumps.  In the engine room they didn‚Äôt know exactly how long the Titanic would be able to hold out on the surface, but they knew for sure that he wouldn‚Äôt reach America. </p><br><p>  Undoubtedly, Magento 2 is a development of the previous version - modularity has improved, compatibility with composer has been achieved, more modern solutions are used both on the front and on the server side, the code is <a href="https://github.com/magento/magento2">publicly available</a> and we are <a href="https://travis-ci.org/magento/magento2">testing</a> , the performance has been improved.  At first glance, quite a wonderful perspective. </p><br><p>  But what, nevertheless, darkens the picture? </p><br><h2 id="obem">  Volume </h2><br><p>  Magento 2 has 1,357,121 lines of PHP code and 2,449,066 lines of total (WordPress - <a href="https://www.openhub.net/p/wordpress/analyses/latest/languages_summary">423,759</a> ; WooCommerce - <a href="https://www.openhub.net/p/WooCommerce/analyses/latest/languages_summary">131,549</a> ; osCommerce - <a href="https://www.openhub.net/p/osCommerce/analyses/latest/languages_summary">208,928</a> ; Drupal - <a href="https://www.openhub.net/p/drupal/analyses/latest/languages_summary">704,269</a> ). </p><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Magento 1.9.3.2</b> <div class="spoiler_text"><pre><code class="hljs pgsql">$ cloc vendor/magento/core/ <span class="hljs-number"><span class="hljs-number">12915</span></span> <span class="hljs-type"><span class="hljs-type">text</span></span> files. <span class="hljs-number"><span class="hljs-number">12797</span></span> <span class="hljs-keyword"><span class="hljs-keyword">unique</span></span> files.

What exactly are the problems? </p><br><h2 id="struktury-dannyh">  Data structures </h2><br><p>  The developers of Magento 2 had a great chance to significantly rework the data structure - it was officially announced that the second version would be incompatible with the first.  And the data structures made a significant shift - the tables and fields were renamed / added / deleted so that the database from the first version really could not be used in the second. </p><br><p>  But it is clear that the main motivator in the processing was still ‚Äúas little change as possible‚Äù.  Otherwise, how can you explain the mismatch of store_id in the database and Store in the admin panel that migrated to the "two" (store_id in the database is the Store View attribute in the admin panel, but group_id in the database is just an attribute for the Store in the admin panel) and this cannot be understood remember)?  Or ambiguous dependencies between data in the same store-tables or <a href="https://github.com/magento/magento2/issues/4916">stock-tables</a> ? </p><br><p>  Or such a fundamental (or rhetorical?) Question - why for EAV there are only 8 types of entities (customer, customer_address, catalog_category, catalog_product, order, invoice, creditmemo, shipment) from which only product attributes (catalog_product) are available through the admin panel for EAV?  Why are entities like admin, authorization, stock, sales_rule, cms, rating, report, review, ... ignored? </p><br><p>  This, by the way, is awesome, especially at first - why produce support for EAV in data structures, if in fact the end user of the Community version can apply it only to one type of data, to products?  And yes, it slows down the entire application (at least in developer-mode) and is the reason for the emergence of flat-tables.  And yes, in the "two" part of the client's attributes was nevertheless transferred to the customer_entity (28 fields, versus 12 "ones"). </p><br><h2 id="kod">  Code </h2><br><p>  Magento 2 has significantly reworked the architecture - and this is a clear progress.  I can only welcome the appearance of the DI and the layer of the repository classes, the integration of the API with <a href="http://swagger.io/">Swagger,</a> and the expansion of the CLI command set with my own commands.  But ... try to programmatically store (Store View in terms of admin), guided by the <a href="http://devdocs.magento.com/guides/v2.0//extension-dev-guide/service-contracts/design-patterns.html">best practices</a> from Magento 2 - <a href="http://magento.stackexchange.com/questions/119907/how-to-create-store-view-or-store-programmatically-and-do-it-right-in-mage-2">it will not work</a> .  This is despite the fact that the repo class for \ Magento \ Store \ Model \ Store <a href="https://github.com/magento/magento2/blob/develop/app/code/Magento/Store/Api/StoreRepositoryInterface.php">exists</a> , but without the <em>save ()</em> method, and the standard <em>save</em> method for the "edinichka" inherited from \ Magento \ Framework \ Model \ AbstractModel is <a href="https://github.com/magento/magento2/blob/develop/lib/internal/Magento/Framework/Model/AbstractModel.php">declared</a> @ deprecated </p><br><p>  And try to find the implementation of the <a href="https://github.com/magento/magento2/blob/develop/app/code/Magento/Sales/Api/OrderStatusHistoryRepositoryInterface.php">\ Magento \ Sales \ Api \ OrderStatusHistoryRepositoryInterface interface</a> .  How would be "\ Magento \ Sales \ Api \ Data \ OrderStatusHistory \ Repository", according to <a href="">di.xml</a> .  Well, try to find the class "\ Magento \ Sales \ Api \ Data \ OrderStatusHistory \ Repository".  Maybe this interface is not used anywhere?  No, it is <a href="https://github.com/magento/magento2/blob/develop/app/code/Magento/Sales/Model/Service/OrderService.php">used</a> .  Maybe autogenerate?  No, Factory, Proxy and Interceptors are <a href="http://devdocs.magento.com/guides/v2.1/extension-dev-guide/code-generation.html">generated</a> , and here we have a repository. </p><br><p>  Wander through the code - there are very redesigned modules (customer, for example), but there is a wrapped code from the "one".  I understand that the ‚Äútwo‚Äù was made on the basis of the ‚Äúone‚Äù, that a ‚Äúpolitical‚Äù decision was made to use as much of the existing code as possible in order to be released to some significant date (for example, selling by ebay or ebay, attracting regular investments, etc.).  Or " <em>to reduce development costs</em> ."  The trouble is not that.  If only this, then the situation could be corrected by systematic and methodical processing of the code.  The trouble is that now in Magento they rule "effective" / "crisis" managers, not techies (guys, no offense - I don't know your names, I judge only by the results). </p><br><h2 id="relizy">  Releases </h2><br><p>  Well, what else can I think when 2 weeks after 2.1.4 comes out 2.1.5 the only <a href="http://devdocs.magento.com/guides/v2.1/release-notes/ReleaseNotes2.1.5CE.html">purpose of</a> which is: </p><br><p>  <em>This release updates the copyright date in every file.</em>  <em>It does not contain any functional changes or security improvements.</em>  <em>It is intended to simplify future updates and developer workflows.</em> </p><br><p>  Release!  A whole release of non-essential changes in terms of techie !!!  And now what, to explain to the owners of the stores that working for them 2.1.4 from the functional point of view is exactly the same as 2.1.5, except perhaps not the last one? </p><br><p>  A <a href="https://github.com/magento/magento2/issues/5509">release plan</a> for mid-February: </p><br><blockquote>  For now 2.1.5 will be copyright, 2.1.6 security and 2.1.7 will have bugfixing. </blockquote><p>  Can we split the bugfixes into two groups - for the front and for the server side?  And for each of your release will do?  And if, on the next day after the release of 2.1.6, a hole in security is discovered, then we will "heal" it in 2.1.8 or 2.1.9? </p><br><h2 id="bugfixes">  bugfixes </h2><br><p>  And the saddest thing, IMHO, is that version 2.1.5 did not include <a href="https://github.com/magento/magento2/pull/5145">this</a> pull request.  Here is the error code: </p><br><pre> <code class="php hljs"> <span class="hljs-keyword"><span class="hljs-keyword">public</span></span> <span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-keyword"><span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-keyword">function</span></span></span><span class="hljs-function"> </span><span class="hljs-title"><span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-title">getStockId</span></span></span><span class="hljs-params"><span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-params">()</span></span></span><span class="hljs-function"> </span></span>{ <span class="hljs-keyword"><span class="hljs-keyword">return</span></span> <span class="hljs-keyword"><span class="hljs-keyword">$this</span></span>-&gt;getData(<span class="hljs-keyword"><span class="hljs-keyword">self</span></span>::KEY_WEBSITE_ID); }</code> </pre> <br><p>  here is the corrected: </p><br><pre> <code class="php hljs"> <span class="hljs-keyword"><span class="hljs-keyword">public</span></span> <span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-keyword"><span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-keyword">function</span></span></span><span class="hljs-function"> </span><span class="hljs-title"><span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-title">getStockId</span></span></span><span class="hljs-params"><span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-params">()</span></span></span><span class="hljs-function"> </span></span>{ <span class="hljs-keyword"><span class="hljs-keyword">return</span></span> <span class="hljs-keyword"><span class="hljs-keyword">$this</span></span>-&gt;getData(<span class="hljs-keyword"><span class="hljs-keyword">self</span></span>::KEY_STOCK_ID); }</code> </pre> <br><p>  He was posted by a colleague <a href="https://github.com/fe-lix-">F√©lix Delval</a> on September 29, 2016.  Before the release of version 2.1.2 (October 12, 2016), version 2.1.3 (December 14, 2016), version 2.1.4 (February 7, 2017) and to the notorious version 2.1.5 (February 21, 2017).  Judging by the release plan, the error will be fixed in 2.1.7 - in 3-4 months. </p><br><p>  But this is an obvious mistake, understandable even to novice programmers.  How much time she has devoured by all 10 (!!!) participants of the discussion of this bug and has not yet been fixed! </p><br><p>  Oh, no, I'm lying - <a href="https://github.com/magento/magento2/blob/develop/app/code/Magento/CatalogInventory/Model/Stock/Status.php">fixed</a> in developer-branch.  But in <a href="https://github.com/magento/magento2/blob/2.1/app/code/Magento/CatalogInventory/Model/Stock/Status.php">releases</a> - and continues to be. </p><br><p>  I don‚Äôt ask the question ‚Äúhow many such <em>fixed</em> bugs are there in the developer branch and not in the release ones‚Äù, simply because I‚Äôm afraid to hear the answer. </p><br><h2 id="inerciya">  Inertia </h2><br><p>  Magento has a good history, an impressive community, a decent ‚Äúpiece‚Äù in the e-commerce cake, but ... at the same time, I see a loss of controllability in the project.  Magento 2 has ceased to respond to changes in a timely manner.  She has become too big.  Like Microsoft at one time. </p><br><p>  Perhaps some laws come into force, according to which not only programming, but also the creation of complex systems in general - "a desperate losing battle".  The structure comes close to some unknown complexity border, when each next step is like all previous steps taken together, and for building up functionality it is easier to create something new - another structure that implements similar functionality on different principles and at a lower level of complexity and allows to increase this functionality until it in turn comes close to the same border.  In physics, there is a similar boundary - the speed of light, why should it not be in programming? </p><br><p>  So, the inertia in Magento 2 due to its complexity has become so large that it becomes harder and harder to manage its development.  The above problems in data structures, code, bugfixes, releases are consequences of approaching the "upper limit of complexity". </p><br><h2 id="disclaimer">  Disclaimer </h2><br><p>  Hey, that's my subjective opinion.  I am not a lawyer and not an effective manager, I am a developer, a techie.  I see a picture from my perspective and see it like this. </p><br><h1 id="vive-le-roi">  Vive le Roi? </h1><br><p>  As the saying goes, "holy place is never empty."  And if not Magento, then - who? </p><br><p><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/1e1/1ac/314/1e11ac314e0c4a939db4607d7f8a95a3.png" alt="image"></p><br><p>  Judging by <a href="https://www.datanyze.com/market-share/e-commerce-platforms/">this</a> data - WooCommerce?  Or, for the time being, who did not shoot <a href="https://ru.orocrm.com/">OroCommerce</a> - from the authors of the "one"?  Or maybe even a little-known player, like <a href="http://sylius.org/">Sylius</a> ?  Or will the new ‚Äúking‚Äù not be in <a href="https://reactioncommerce.com/">PHP</a> at all?  Where will the end users of e-commerce platforms go and who will become the new crystallization center? </p><br><p>  I have no answer to all these questions. </p></div>
