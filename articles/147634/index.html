      Today on <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/weo8j/today_a_homeless_looking_man_handed_me_50_and/">Reddit'e</a> appeared the next, in my opinion very curious, post.  I offer you his translation: <br><br><blockquote>  Dear Reddit, <br><br>  I work in New York, and today I had a rather unusual case. <br>  I'm driving, so, in the subway from the center of our city to the business district.  The train car, as usual, is packed with people to the eyeballs. <br>  Then a peasant smiled at me in some shabby clothes. <br>  I, of course, did not attach much importance to this, when suddenly, on the way to the exit to the train door, this same man pulls me 50 bucks along with some kind of note. <br>  As I opened my mouth in surprise, the man was already out of the car. <br>  Below I offer you photos of the front and back sides of that note. <br><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Front side of the note:</b> <div class="spoiler_text"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/563/777/ccd/563777ccddf05ca83f7ad6046857108e.jpg"></div></div><br><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Reverse side of the note:</b> <div class="spoiler_text"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/d76/37d/3ba/d7637d3baed3d2a38997c004493e8ff6.jpg"></div></div><br><br>  All day I thought about this note, but, of course, did not understand what was happening.  It looks like an ordinary square piece of paper measuring 3 by 3 inches, without any embossments or watermarks.  Almost all scattered on the cells.  Without any logic visible to me, the letters and numbers were inscribed, and in the lower rows there were also some flourishes. <br>  Maybe I‚Äôm writing and posting all this for nothing, and it was just another New York city madman, but I‚Äôm still very interested to know if anyone on Reddit has already encountered a similar situation.  How many of you have any ideas as to what is said in this note, although there may be nothing at all there. </blockquote><br><br><blockquote>  <b>UPD:</b> Now came to my friend in New Jersey.  I didn‚Äôt expect that this post would interest everyone here, but I see that most of them write in the comments to the post that this is some kind of cipher.  Yes, this is the first thing I thought about, but it did not work out for me to solve it.  Others, I see, write that a 50-dollar bill should also be some kind of special.  So, the only thing that I noticed on it is unusual, because it is the number "7", which was written on the reverse side, but I do not understand how this relates to the note.  Sfotkal her on the phone: <br><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Front side of the banknote:</b> <div class="spoiler_text"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/adb/481/714/adb48171454f9e803de9c1e935db5ecf.jpg"></div></div><br><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Reverse side of the banknote:</b> <div class="spoiler_text"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/f2f/11e/f87/f2f11ef87b98c6a009b681d464668b6c.jpg"></div></div><br><br>  In the evening I will not be here, but closer to the night I will definitely come here. <br><br>  The front side of the banknote is slightly darkened, suddenly it also has some meaning ... </blockquote><br><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">The solution of the first cipher (Attention, spoiler!):</b> <div class="spoiler_text">  <i>(This is the <a href="http://www.securitylab.ru/forum/forum29/topic45144/">"Bifid cipher"</a> , <a href="http://www.securitylab.ru/forum/forum29/topic45144/">guessed</a> from <a href="http://rumkin.com/tools/cipher/bifid.php">this</a> site.

Everyone wanted to finally understand what was behind this story: a recruitment agency looking for talented cryptographers, a government operation or a well-directed viral advertising campaign.  Most inclined to the latest version - this is a promotional campaign for the premiere of the film <a href="http://www.kinopoisk.ru/level/1/film/437410/">‚ÄúThe Dark Knight: Revival of a Legend‚Äù</a> , which is to be held in the US in a week. <br>  Everyone who came in constantly updated the Reddit post page in their smartphones, expecting to see new facts or comments from the topstarter.  At the same time, everyone scoured in search of the mysterious "blue jay". <br><br>  Just <b>around 4:00 pm</b> , an elderly long-bearded man appeared at the meeting place, dressed in blue.  An excited crowd immediately surrounded him with the hope that this was the ‚ÄúMr.  Input! ‚Äù, The author of the first message with the cipher.  But this old man did not live up to hopes, mumbled something vaguely (someone thought that there might be some kind of new mystery in it), and the audience allowed him to continue.  Yes, you yourself can see how it was - <div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Communication video with a long-bearded old man in blue clothes (in English):</b> <div class="spoiler_text"><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/9tKGueSbWm0%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=25657,15700022,15700186,15700190,15700253,15700256,15700259&amp;usg=ALkJrhgroKKSnhiivanlK_4H4ecZNtlLBQ" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></div></div><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Photos of the old man:</b> <div class="spoiler_text"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/277/ef1/bb1/277ef1bb19b366564694e7ad736cff80.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/226/77a/4d0/22677a4d01c6be3db86767219da07e15.jpg"><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/cb1/766/98f/cb176698fd9670c42e69841c47b2e3d6.jpg">  <a href="">habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/cb1/766/98f/cb176698fd9670c42e69841c47b2e3d6.jpg</a> </div></div><br>  Everything has already been hung up, about to disperse.  After all, the author of the original post, everything was not and was not. <br><br>  Suddenly, <b>at 16:16</b> a comment appeared on Reddit by the author of a post on Reddit: <br><br><blockquote>  I almost arrived.  Now in the subway.  on line E. I will be in 10 minutes. </blockquote><br><br>  People all arrived and arrived.  Someone from the crowd shouted "Yes, the whole Internet is offline!".  Everyone was looking forward to the appearance of the author of the post on Reddit'e.  To the place of a congestion of people, just in case, the police arrived. <br><br>  Only <b>30 minutes</b> later, a new comment from the author of the topic appeared on Reddit. <br><br><blockquote>  Got out of the subway.  Coming to you.  I'm wearing a Yankees cap and I have a briefcase. </blockquote><br><br>  Now the crowd was at its peak.  Everyone was surrounded by some guy in a Yankees cap, but he had no idea what was going on here and went into a nearby building.  People have seen in every passing of the potential author of the post. <br><br>  A few minutes later came the long-awaited topstarter.  Here is a <b><a href="http://www.ustream.tv/recorded/23944803">video from a man who was broadcasting from the scene on Ustream (watch from 12:59)</a></b> . <br><br>  His name is Ali.  In his hands he had a note with the first cipher. <br><br><blockquote>  And I thought ten people would come from strength, - </blockquote><br><br>  he said he surrounded him and eagerly studied the brought note to the crowd <br><br><blockquote>  The train dragged slowly, - </blockquote><br><br>  He explained to those who came to meet Sherlock. <br><br>  It turns out that Ali has already managed to see a photo of a mysterious long-bearded old man who has already been placed on Reddit.  Topikstarter said that the old man does not look like a man who transferred him the code in the subway car: <br><br><blockquote>  The stranger was shaved bald, about my height </blockquote><br><br>  Ali did not speak his last name to those who had gathered, since one resourceful reader of Reddit had already <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/weo8j/today_a_homeless_looking_man_handed_me_50_and/c5d2dty">somehow</a> dug up his Facebook profile and even his phone number. <br><br><blockquote>  Someone constantly calls me, repeating: ‚ÄúYou are a time traveler!‚Äù </blockquote><br><br>  Topikstarter also does not understand the purpose for which all this has been started and with whom he should meet. <br><br><blockquote>  Yes, I thought that this may be an advertising campaign.  But I assure you, I know nothing about her. </blockquote><br><br>  As a result, the meeting with the Blue Jay did not take place, as the police asked the crowd to disperse.  There were suggestions that the second cipher was sent to him by someone who knew him in real life and wanted to play this way. <br><br>  Ali also (as it turned out very vain later) admitted that the <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/147634/">nickname of the sender of the personal message with the second cipher</a> is his phone number, read the other way around.  Thus, it is possible that this meeting was a joke, and the second scheduled meeting (July 19) will take place. <br><br>  <a href="http://imgur.com/a/wxHtn">Photos from the meeting.</a> <br><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">The end of the story (quite prosaic)</b> <div class="spoiler_text">  On Reddit, the author of the original post erased everything and wrote the following: <br><br><blockquote>  July 13, 10:38.  Today they called me and threatened not only me, but also my family.  The caller said that he would reveal the addresses and names of members of my family if I did not immediately remove my post.  Also, this person did not recommend me or anyone else to go to the second meeting on July 19th, since nothing will happen there.  This will be my last post written from this account before I delete it.  Also change today number.  I'm sorry that we never got to the truth, but I cannot endanger my family because of a few bucks. </blockquote></div></div><br><br><h6>  <i>All comments on the translation (this is what I am doing here for the first time) and errors, please send in a personal.</i> </h6></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/147634/">https://habr.com/ru/post/147634/</a></p>
