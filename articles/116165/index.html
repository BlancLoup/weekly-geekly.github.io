I looked at how our administrator uses it at work and decided that the thing is useful.  Despite 360 ‚Äã‚Äãrubles for the air, did not regret it. <br><br>  Someone who has tried to vacuum the system unit, especially in a neglected state, knows that this is a dreadful job, and the result is so-so.  The dust between the plates of the radiator and on the blades of the cooler pulls out the vacuum cleaner badly, and this, in fact, is the most important thing for which cleaning is needed. <br><br>  At first, I, too, had vacuumed everything I could, and far from the worst Kirby vacuum cleaner.  It turned out clean, but far from perfect. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/6091774c/11e58876/d2d93fc2/2dcec75f.jpg" align="right" hspace="10"><br>  Then he took an open sistemnik and spray in the bathroom, so as not to breed dirt.  "Bubble" is initially quite heavy, probably more than a pound.  The seller said that there should be enough for a dozen cleansing.  But I had a very neglected case - I didn‚Äôt clean it for 2 years, from the very purchase.  Therefore, I did not regret the air and tried to blow everything up to which I reached.

      The result exceeded expectations.  Now everything looks like new and, importantly, the fan on the processor has ceased to buzz nasty.  I was about to change it, but now it is not necessary.  In places, there remained a strong dust stuck to the blades, but not much at all.  For those with dust allergies, I think it is better to wear a bandage for the duration of the purge. <br><br>  Thus cleared two sistemnik, spending 2/3 cartridges.  I think if cleaned in a timely manner, it really should be enough for 10 times. <br><br>  The spray cools during the spraying process.  Also, if you blow from a close distance, then frost forms on the blown surfaces, which, however, disappears immediately.  A thin tube is put on the sprayer, so you can get to the most remote corners or, say, behind the grid of the power supply unit. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Experienced people suggest using a car compressor, but I think it is unnecessary.  It can be useful for the admin to purge dozens of servers, and at home is enough of such a bottle.  In addition, they say, powerful compressors blow the keys off the keyboard. <br><br>  Although the manufacturer claims that you can clean the optics, I would not expose an expensive SLR to such tests.  The pressure is really very strong.  Better, probably, use a special pear. <br><br>  In general, a computer gadget is useful. <br><br>  PS In the comments several times there was an option to turn on the vacuum cleaner for blowing.  I forgot to try this option, but judging by the reviews, it works fine. <br><br>  PPS Comments are more interesting than the topic! <br><br>  PPPS I changed the cooler photo to a more decent one.  He forgot to take a picture of himself, and the one who inserted it into the article initially called deserved reproaches of carelessness. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/116165/">https://habr.com/ru/post/116165/</a></p>
