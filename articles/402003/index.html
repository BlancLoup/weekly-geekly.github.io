It's about March 8, where the problem is not in the holiday itself, but in choosing a gift: you want to give something that will be remembered for a long time and will be useful not only one day in March.  We are not talking about flowers, hearts, balls and other things now - all this is given and will be given without our help.  What if donating a smartphone, laptop or tablet (although this is not bad, especially if your familiar girl needs such a gadget), but something that a person does not expect to receive as a gift?  It is pleasant surprises that are remembered the most.  We choose interesting, and most importantly useful gifts with Madrobots. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h3>  External battery Ozaki O! Tool Battery D26 </h3><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/_tAi9Ia1urU" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br>  Electricity is necessary for modern man almost as much as air, no matter how sad it may sound.  All phones, trackers, smart watches need to be regularly charged.  In a hike, flight in an airplane or a simple walk along the street, when you need to make an important call, the source of electricity is not always found.  And here comes to the aid of an external battery from the company Ozaki. <br><br>  Its capacity is 2600 mAh.  The functions of the device are quite ordinary: it charges compatible devices via a Micro-USB cable (if you wish, you can pick up other types of USB cables).  The difference of this battery from others is not in functionality, but in design.  The battery is made in the form of a robot, which immediately attracts attention.  Sliding cover protects the USB port of the device from dust and dirt.  To check the battery level, simply press the corresponding button.

      The battery is small, its dimensions are only 32 x 99 x 32 mm.  In any women's handbag, it fits, not to mention a backpack. <br><br>  You can buy this battery in the <a href="http://madrobots.ru/p/-o-tool-battery-d26/%3Futm_source%3Dgeektimes.ru%26utm_medium%3Dpr%26utm_campaign%3D8marta">Madrobots catalog</a> . <br><br><h3>  LePlant Bonsai Levitating Plant Pot </h3><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/7pNDt9ew0No" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br>  In the fall, we <a href="https://geektimes.ru/company/medgadgets/blog/272656/">published a selection of</a> levitating gadgets on Geektimes.  Now is the time to recall one of the devices from that collection: a levitating plant pot for growing bonsai dwarf trees.  Of course, you can grow anything in it, including violets or tomatoes.  But the tree that soars in the air makes the greatest impression. <br><br>  The principle here is simple - magnetic levitation.  Thanks to the laws of physics, the pot hovers above the platform (it is included), spinning evenly.  The stand is equipped with an electromagnetic system that interacts with the magnetic part of the pot.  Rotation allows you to simultaneously surprise a visitor to your office or guest at home, plus provide every leaf of the plant with the same conditions: air, lighting, and air flow. <br><br>  The pot will look great in your home or office.  The main thing - do not forget to take care of the plant itself. <br><br>  You can buy this miracle of technology in <a href="http://madrobots.ru/p/leplant-bonsay/%3Futm_source%3Dgeektimes.ru%26utm_medium%3Dpr%26utm_campaign%3D8marta">our catalog</a> . <br><br><h3>  Bluetooth tracker Nonda iHere 3.0 </h3><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/iB-y7pT0K6c" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br>  Everyone knows that only the owner of a woman can find something in a women's handbag (and even then, not always).  Try to find a wallet, a cosmetic bag, a phone, a pen, headphones, keys to an apartment or a car from the first time - you will definitely need luck.  It happens that things are lost, and this is utterly frustrating for the owner, and indeed for anyone.  Some women forget their handbags or wallets in a taxi, in a cafe, in auditoriums, with friends - wherever possible. <br><br>  If your friend has already lost something, then you should give her a Nonda Bluetooth tracker.  It is attached to a certain thing (the same keys, purse, wallet) and tracks its location.  Also using this tracker, you can control the camera of a smartphone or make voice recordings. <br><br>  The main function of the tag is to signal the loss of the thing to which the device is attached.  Monitoring is carried out using a free application in which you can register up to 10 trackers at a time.  The keychain signal is tracked within a radius of up to 23 meters.  If the signal is lost, the application notifies of the loss.  So having forgotten the same purse in a cafe or car, the owner, having retired for a short distance (it is adjusted), will immediately receive a warning.  By the way, if the label is attached to the keys, and you cannot find them, then by pressing the button in the application, you can make the label give a loud signal of 85 dB.  Keys (or any other object to which the label is attached) will be there and then.  Such a thing is needed and men, of course, but since March 8 is soon, this will be a relevant and useful gift. <br><br>  In Russia, you can buy the Nonda iHere 3.0 Bluetooth Tracker <a href="http://madrobots.ru/p/nonda-ihere-3-key-finder/%3Futm_source%3Dgeektimes.ru%26utm_medium%3Dpr%26utm_campaign%3D8marta">at Madrobots</a> . <br><br><h3>  Anti-stress cube Fidget Cube </h3><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/m5eq0TVxCKw" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br>  In the harsh conditions of modern life is quite difficult to maintain peace of mind.  Calls from dissatisfied customers, quarrels in the family, or troubles of any other type - all this leads to stress.  Some people because of this, even in a normal situation, are nervous, without even noticing it. <br><br>  Finally, a simple way was invented to relieve nervousness.  This is the Fidget Cube cube.  We have already reviewed the possibilities of the cube, so we will not repeat.  The only thing we say that this is a small gadget that fits in any pocket or purse. <br><br>  On the faces of the cube there are buttons, levers, balls and a joystick.  All this clicks, turns and ... soothes.  For the modern girl or woman - an invaluable gift.  Who wants to be nervous about nothing?  A magic cube helps to get rid of nervousness.  Actually, without nerves, click the buttons and twist the levers of many of us in joy. <br><br>  Buy Fidget Cube you can in <a href="http://madrobots.ru/p/fidget-cube/%3Futm_source%3Dgeektimes.ru%26utm_medium%3Dpr%26utm_campaign%3D8marta">Madrobots</a> . <br><br><h3>  Genuine Leather iphone 7 case from ZAVTRA </h3><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/fe6/30f/419/fe630f41940b4757830db5deadb6e910.jpg" width="850"><br><br>  Few modern people have a mobile phone.  Many seek to buy the latest iPhone model, in which there is nothing shameful.  But such smartphones are extremely vulnerable to external influences, so protection is required.  In Madrobots, there are cases of genuine leather for the iPhone 7. The cover is made in Russia by our own brand Zavtra, and we vouch for its quality.  Protection of the phone provides a durable polycarbonate body, covered with high-quality leather. <br><br>  There is in the case and pocket for plastic cards.  In general, such a cover will be appreciated by any owner of the latest smartphone model from the iPhone, especially in taste you will have a cover of pink or mint color - pastel colors are still in trend.  This is a great gift, you can be sure :) <br><br>  Covers are available in brown, black, blue, pink and mint color. <br><br>  If you want to buy a case, then you can do it in <a href="http://madrobots.ru/p/zavtra-bamper-iphone7/%3Futm_source%3Dgeektimes.ru%26utm_medium%3Dpr%26utm_campaign%3D8marta">our store</a> . <br><br><h3>  Atlas Genetic Test </h3><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/15a/7d8/f96/15a7d8f960817b19e47cab4f3c034e7a.jpg" width="850"><br><br>  A genetic test is almost an ideal gift for everyone.  Atlas decrypts the human DNA from a sample of its biological material (saliva sample).  When buying a test, a person receives a container with a test tube, where to place the sample, and instructions.  The material is placed in a test tube and sent to the specified address.  After this, the most interesting begins: the company's specialists decipher the human genome and carefully analyze the data obtained.  The survey data form is filled out, scanned and sent to the user's personal account. <br><br>  The final stage - familiarity with the results.  A person receives a transcript with a number of health management tips, divided into several categories (advice is given based on the results of the analysis).  Categories are as follows: health risks, nutritional characteristics with recommendations on food choices, physical exercise tips, information about the origin of ancestors.  The last point is personal qualities.  This is the probability of living a long life, determining the level of IQ, temperament and more. <br><br>  We can say that the test allows a person to recognize himself from the new side, because it allows him to estimate the probability of getting sick with one of 114 common diseases, to determine the possible presence of hereditary diseases, to learn about the possible reaction of the body to 66 drugs.  Plus, a person gets at his disposal about 40 recommendations on nutrition and sports. <br><br>  You can purchase the Atlas test at any time <a href="http://madrobots.ru/p/atlas/%3Futm_source%3Dgeektimes.ru%26utm_medium%3Dpr%26utm_campaign%3D8marta">at Madrobots</a> . <br><br><h3>  AquaFarm AquaFarm </h3><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/BGdZrjPElco" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br>  A good option for home or office.  Aqua farm is a balanced closed ecosystem that supports the existence of plants and fish.  Fish lives, eats, gives waste.  They serve as nutrients for plants located on the lid of the aquarium.  Plants, consuming these nutrients, at the same time purify the aquarium water.  You can plant ornamental species, or you can plant greens in order to use the ‚Äúgreen product‚Äù in your kitchen. <br><br>  To start, you need to fill the special pallets with soil, plant the plants and fill the aquarium with water.  Then we connect the Aqua farm to the outlet (electricity drives the water circulation system) and launch the fish into the aquarium, which, by the way, needs to be fed.  The fish is better to swim in splendid isolation, more manufacturers do not recommend running into the aquarium. <br><br>  In Russia, the Akvaferma is sold <a href="http://madrobots.ru/p/akvaferma-aquafarm/%3Futm_source%3Dgeektimes.ru%26utm_medium%3Dpr%26utm_campaign%3D8marta">in Madrobots</a> . <br><br><h3>  Tablet for drawing water Buddha Board </h3><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/4a8/52a/4e3/4a852a4e30eed3a481467b9faa35ae90.jpg" width="850"><br>  On the tablet Buddha Board, you can draw with clean water.  The main tool for this is a large bamboo brush.  According to the developers, the system allows you to have a great time, completely immersed in art with a distraction from extraneous thoughts.  Using the tablet, you can try out various drawing techniques without using paints or canvases. <br><br>  In order to start work, you need to hold a brush dipped in water on the surface of the board.  A trace will appear.  Actually, the difference from the usual pattern is that there are no paints, plus the picture itself is not too durable: as soon as the water begins to evaporate, the image gradually disappears.  After the water has dried completely, you can create again and so on to infinity.  Zen in action, we tested. <br><br>  The tablet is sold in the <a href="http://madrobots.ru/p/planshet-dlya-risovaniya-vodoy-buddha-board/%3Futm_source%3Dgeektimes.ru%26utm_medium%3Dpr%26utm_campaign%3D8marta">store Madrobots</a> . <br><br><h3>  Smart Garden Click and Grow Basil </h3><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Jubqc943zY8" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br>  Greens grown with love with their own hands, especially tasty.  In order to do in their own kitchen growing plants, experience is not required.  Enough with a set of smart garden Click and Grow.  With it, you can constantly grow basil, tomatoes, peppers and even strawberries. <br><br>  The gadget itself consists of a flowerpot, a cartridge with nutrients, seeds, and a lamp that provides the plants with light.  The system works in automatic mode, so that some supernatural skills are not needed to become a gardener. <br><br>  From a person is required to pour water, install batteries and insert the adapter into the outlet.  After a time, Click and Grow will yield.  This system can work not only at home, but also, for example, in the office.  The first shoots appear 2-3 weeks after the start of the work of the ‚Äúhome bed‚Äù.  To eat greens ready in about six months.  From now on, the owner‚Äôs kitchen of Click and Grow will always have fresh greens. <br><br>  If your friend doesn‚Äôt mind the plants, or she always wants to have products that are always fresh and free from chemicals, this miniature garden is just what you need. <br><br>  You can buy this system in Russia in the <a href="http://madrobots.ru/p/umnyy-sad-click-and-grow-smart-herb-garden/%3Futm_source%3Dgeektimes.ru%26utm_medium%3Dpr%26utm_campaign%3D8marta">online store Madrobots</a> . <br><br><hr><br> <a href="http://madrobots.ru/%3Futm_source%3Dgeektimes.ru%26utm_medium%3Dpr%26utm_campaign%3D8marta"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/d29/4c3/07d/d294c307dde04335ac3f425e73b36a7a.gif"></a> <br> <a href="http://madrobots.ru/about/mails/%3Futm_source%3Dgeektimes.ru%26utm_medium%3Dpr%26utm_campaign%3D8marta"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/7fa/417/fe3/7fa417fe3d464fa5aa186b1ab30da53a.gif"></a> <br><br>  The main thing, in general, is not the gift itself, but the pleasant sensations that you can deliver to a dear person.
