Among the reasons that prompted this, Drew Houston listed the details of her academic career - in 1981-1987, Rice held the post of assistant professor at Stanford University, and since 2007 she has been its vice-rector.  Rice also served on the boards of directors of several other companies, for example, <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hewlett-Packard">Hewlett-Packard</a> and <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/RAND_%2528%25D0%25BA%25D0%25BE%25D1%2580%25D0%25BF%25D0%25BE%25D1%2580%25D0%25B0%25D1%2586%25D0%25B8%25D1%258F%2529">RAND Corporation</a> .  Of course, in the former USSR, she is most well known as the 66th Secretary of State of the United States, which means that she ruled the US State Department from 2005 to 2009.  Most likely, in this way, in Dropbox, they are preparing for the first initial offering (IPO), and a person of the Rice level can help them greatly in this. <br><br>  Of course, the response of a part of Internet users to such a decision was outrage.  The web site even appeared ‚Äú <a href="http://www.drop-dropbox.com/">Drop Dropbox</a> ‚Äù (‚ÄúDropbox‚Äù), which briefly talks about why customers of the popular cloud storage should boycott the service. <br><br>  The situation in which the board of directors of a US private company includes former politicians or, more specifically, representatives of a certain party, is not the reason for this rejection.  For example, Democrat <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%2593%25D0%25BE%25D1%2580,_%25D0%2590%25D0%25BB%25D1%258C%25D0%25B1%25D0%25B5%25D1%2580%25D1%2582">Al Gore</a> is on the Board of Directors of Eppla and is the unofficial advisor and manager of Google. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  The first on the Drop Drop Dropbox website is the details of Rice‚Äôs political career.  As US Secretary of State, she didn‚Äôt just follow instructions from above; she also actively advocated the start of the war in Iraq.  In fact, Rice was an important part of the Bush campaign to spread lies about hostilities.  In 2003, Condoleezza Rice published in the New York Times an article entitled ‚Äú <a href="http%253A%252F%252Finosmi.ru%252Funtitled%252F20030123%252F169623.html">Why we know that Iraq is lying</a> .‚Äù

      The war in Iraq cost 120 thousand peaceful lives.  <a href="https://www.iraqbodycount.org/">In total, it claimed 188 thousand</a> , among which there were 5 thousand soldiers of the United States and the coalition.  More than 30 thousand were seriously injured.  According to a <a href="http://www.plosmedicine.org/article/info%253Adoi%252F10.1371%252Fjournal.pmed.1001533">University of Washington study</a> , a total of 500,000 people died as a result of direct and indirect actions of the Iraq war. <br><br>  Rice‚Äôs ‚Äúsins‚Äù list also includes support for the Bush administration‚Äôs program that permits torture of political prisoners.  The former US secretary of state <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/northamerica/usa/5208701/Condoleezza-Rice-approved-torture-techniques.html">approved the</a> use of torture on detained suspects, and later <a href="http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2009/04/22/bush-adviser-rice-gave-ok-waterboard/">lied</a> about the extent of involvement in such programs. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/ee6/28d/625/ee628d625a760a7b07c7a06453d901cd.jpg" align="right" width="300">  Her previous actions, in principle, can be omitted, as they relate to politics.  Far more important is the participation of Condoleezza Rice in surveillance and listening programs.  She not only <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2005/POLITICS/12/18/bush.nsa/">supported the</a> audition and an extensive monitoring program without a court order and warrant, but also <a href="http://rawstory.com/news/2005/After_domestic_spying_reports_U.S._spying_1227.html">allowed the</a> audition of members of the UN Security Council. <br><br>  Given the well-known details of the US National Security Agency's system for full-scale listening to voice and Internet traffic and the role of Condoleezza Rice in it, there is no reason to want her to participate in the service, the purpose of which is to securely store user files. <br><br>  The Drop Dropbox website calls for switching to any other cloud storage and file synchronization service, among them <a href="https://www.box.com/">Box.com</a> , <a href="https://onedrive.live.com/">Microsoft OneDrive</a> , <a href="https://spideroak.com/">SpiderOak</a> , <a href="http://drive.google.com/">Google Drive</a> , <a href="http://mega.co.nz/">Mega</a> , <a href="https://disk.yandex.ru/">Yandex.Disk</a> , <a href="https://www.sugarsync.com/">SugarSync</a> and <a href="http://alternativeto.net/software/dropbox/">other alternatives</a> or setting up your own server using the <a href="https://prism-break.org/en/all/">programs list PRISM Break</a> .  It is also proposed to publish in the social networking services a message about disagreement with the inclusion of Condoleezza Rice on the Dropbox Board of Directors. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/284882/">https://habr.com/ru/post/284882/</a></p>
