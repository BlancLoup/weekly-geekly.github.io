  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Fashionable phone - the race for fashion or the need?</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  On an interesting <a href="http://darudar.org/">resource,</a> on occasion, I <a href="http://darudar.org/gift/41821/">got an</a> interesting and, one might say, vintage phone. <br><img src="http://darudar.org/var/files/img/be/cf/becfd7dcc306717d06e3d7a942082e3b_600.jpg" alt="image"><br>  Since I have been working in a cellular company for about 5 years, I tried and changed a lot of various phones (I currently have 5800).  So this very <i>gift</i> at the moment corresponds to my ideas about the perfect phone almost 100%. <br>  In the course of life, work and use of mobile communication the question was born: <br>  <b>Do the average user need so many functions provided by manufacturers of smartphones and communicators?</b> <b><br></b> <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  I began to analyze, using my own example, how much I use the capabilities of my smartphone, how much I need it.  I gave him 15,000 rubles for NG, now he is worth even more.  Think about it - this is the <b>cost of an average laptop !!!</b>  At the same time, it is possible to fully surf the network only in places with Wi-Fi and then - with a lot of reservations, as the browser does not always work correctly with ‚Äúheavy‚Äù sites, the battery quickly discharges in this mode.  The cost of communicators on VinMobile rolls over and even more - for 20-25 thousand rubles.  Due to what is formed such a cost devices? <br><br>  What I found after 3 months of use - I really only call, send SMS and use the alarm clock (at the service rate, I can not limit myself in the use of additional services).  Yes, I also listen to music on my way to work / from work.  I play a couple of "casual" games, when there is absolutely nothing to do, and the computer is busy.  In the first month or two, I really used the device to the "full coil", ran it around, and now I am tired of it, I didn‚Äôt give a damn about most of the opportunities it provides and I don‚Äôt understand why I spent so much money on it. <br>  Earlier, the same story was with the Nokia N800 tablet. <br><br>  Thanks <a href="http://geektimes.ru/users/ilembitov/" class="user_link">ilembitov</a> for the reminder - another inconvenience that kills in all-in-one devices - the service life from one charge is significantly reduced when using at least a third of the device functions.  There is a risk to remain without communication, and without the Internet, and without GPS (you can continue yourself).

      Going to the subway ... The overwhelming number of tricked mobile phones - students and schoolchildren. <br>  Those.  the student earns money, saves his scholarship, borrows, borrows, finally. <br>  It puts in the phone a SIM card with the most popular tariff without subs.  the board and starts saving every penny, but - in his pocket a small designer miracle used as a player is the maximum. <br><br>  For myself, I have already made a decision: maybe they will call me a geek, a ‚Äúretrogradom‚Äù and something else, but I sell my smartphone, add a bit of money and buy a mediocre laptop. <br>  For calls - a telephone, for music - a player with support for all common formats.  For the Internet - a laptop with a modem-usb and Wi-Fi.  Following the results of this experiment, I am going to write a report here, how much more comfortable-uncomfortable I began to live with the transition to such a division of the devices around me, in function. <br><br>  <b>What do you think about this, how often do you use the non-telephone functions of your phone / communicator / smartphone and how much do you think the price of your ‚Äúcommunication device‚Äù is justified?</b> <br><br>  All names of manufacturers, links to sites, etc.  given to describe my personal situation, which led to the question, are not advertising and can be easily replaced with similar ones with similar meaning.  Those.  instead of Nokia, you can write HTC, Samsung, Palm etc.  This is post-reflection and post-discussion, not holivar. <br><br>  Thanks for attention. <br><br>  UPD: Pernes in "smartphones and communicators." <br>  The Alkatel OT 700 patient showed himself to be a vigorous old man, prone to spontaneous rebooting when entering the phone book. <br>  On Saturday, if they give a payday, I will go to the Savelovsky market and choose a ‚Äúdialer‚Äù for the experiment, which I will replace my Nokia 5800 smartphone with for a month. <br>  With the acquisition of the device, I will give a start to the month without a ‚Äúsmart‚Äù, I will unsubscribe daily (if possible) on <a href="http://twitter.com/boorooom">Twitter.</a> <br>  In a month I will compile the report and publish it on Habr√©.  Thank you all for your support and interesting discussions. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/56661/">https://habr.com/ru/post/56661/</a></p>
