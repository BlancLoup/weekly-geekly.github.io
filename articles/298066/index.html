For doctors, ‚Äúthe question of life and death‚Äù is not a metaphor, but working days.  I suppose this is one of the reasons that the quantity of ‚Äúnear-medical‚Äù goods and services is rapidly growing (one example is wearable devices), but their quantity cannot translate into quality. <br><br>  Opening in 2012 the <a href="https://lab4u.ru/">project of laboratory service Lab4U</a> , it was decided to use the already proven technology, but to change the process of testing.  The result of this was that it opened the opportunity to perform all types of medical research on the most modern equipment, but with discounts of up to 50%, and, most importantly, with profit. <br><br>  Details on how this is done can be found in the <a href="http://geektimes.ru/post/263560/">article on ‚ÄúHow to buy chicken pox and whooping cough in the online store‚Äù</a> .  The main know-how is cost reduction due to the rejection of their own treatment rooms in favor of working with independent medical centers.  That is, the user independently selects the necessary analyzes on the site, the place and time of their delivery, and pays the order with a discount of up to 50%.  And then he goes in the direction of one of the clinics, with which the contract for taking the biomaterial.  Such an organization has a potential vulnerability - dependence on the quality of work of Lab4U partners.  To control the outsourcing work, a feedback system was developed, the ‚Äúside effect‚Äù of which later became the conversion of website visitors to customers and an increase in the number of orders by 5%.  I invite those interested under the cat‚Ä¶ <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h4>  When and how to ask? </h4><br>  For Lab4U users, the analysis is completed by sending them the results by email.  This is the most convenient time to get feedback on how satisfied the patient is with the services offered.  The text of the letter with the results includes a link to a questionnaire of 12 questions, each of which is associated with an assessment of a particular area of ‚Äã‚Äãwork.  For example, the effectiveness of channels to attract an audience, the compliance of the stated deadlines for carrying out research with actual ones, or a general assessment of the work of a medical center.

    <h4>  What to interest? </h4><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/megamozg/post_images/b77/140/8a9/b771408a9d923487c9d77c88af8f7664.png" align="left" alt="What to interest?">  Anyone who completes the questionnaire is offered promotional codes for research at a discount of 60% (renal or hepatic tests) or completely free (cholesterol).  This choice is due to the fact that these tests can and should be taken regularly: cholesterol levels correlate with the risk of coronary heart disease.  Liver and kidney tests can assess the condition of the relevant organs and systems that are most vulnerable in everyday life.  On the other hand, each of the patients has a main reason for which he is being tested and, planning a new visit to the treatment room, with a high degree of probability, studies will be added to the basket, which are submitted continuously. <br><br><h4>  Summing up </h4><br>  As a result, every tenth user who has used Lab4U services leaves a review.  All questions of the questionnaire, with the exception of the final one, are closed, which makes it possible to automatically calculate the satisfaction indicator of the service based on the answers.  At the beginning of 2016, it is about 94%.  Each negative review is reviewed, verified and serves as a reason for making decisions.  If necessary, the situation is discussed with the medical center and may lead to its disconnection and the search for a new partner in the region. <br><br>  What is the fate of the promotional codes received for reviews?  On average, every second of them is used for a new order, in which other studies are necessarily present.  Thus, as a free bonus to the feedback system, Lab4U receives an additional up to 5% of orders. <br><br>  Initially, each review was posted on the page of the medical center that the author visited.  This was done to help patients make a choice of location for testing.  About six months ago, a number of actions were taken to increase user confidence in Lab4U, including, reviews were broadcast on a <a href="https://lab4u.ru/reviews/">separate second-level page</a> and Twitter.  The result was a four-fold increase in conversion. <br><br><h4>  Underwater rocks </h4><br>  In conclusion, I would like to dwell on the difficulties with which work with reviews is related, since otherwise there may be an erroneous idea that this is an elementary task. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/megamozg/post_images/59c/b0f/66c/59cb0f66cb0d672ee8efba86fdb78e87.png" align="right" alt="Underwater rocks">  The first difficulty is to find a product or service that, at minimum cost, will effectively motivate the visitor to leave a review.  In addition, such a gift should well complement the existing range. <br><br>  Secondly, reviews without a control system will do more harm than good.  For example, periodically such assessments of partner medical centers come to Lab4U: ‚ÄúI liked everything, but the competence of the staff is in doubt.‚Äù  Such information, rather, misleads users with its inconsistency and should be promptly deleted. <br><br>  I hope the experience of Lab4U will be useful for you and will encourage you to organize work with reviews on your project. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/298066/">https://habr.com/ru/post/298066/</a></p>
