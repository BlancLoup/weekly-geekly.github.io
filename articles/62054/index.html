  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Everything I think about the exam</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  After reading the opinions of a person on the <a href="http://shlemisto.habrahabr.ru/blog/62036/">one hand</a> , I decided to tell tz.  a person who is on the other side, who was involved in an experiment that began in our region in the distant 2003 and only in 2009 takes place in a regular mode. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  <strong>The main thing.</strong>  <strong>(Ideology)</strong> <strong><br></strong> <br>  The Unified State Exam is designed to ensure that when a person graduates from school a person receives an objective assessment (a two-way student, not three, for example), the personal interest of teachers is still in your assessment.  Upon admission to higher education institutions to equalize the chances of different social groups, leveling the differences in the applicant's ‚Äúsolvency‚Äù in one form or another and putting exclusively the students' abilities at the center of the study.  It was planned to do this by introducing a universal objective all-Russian grading system (100 points EGE system), and equating grades obtained at graduation to grades that you automatically received at the entrance exam.  Throughout the Russian Federation.  In any university. <br><br>  <strong>Personal experience:</strong> <i>at the end of the nineties, there was a trend; people who in one form or another (paid courses, specialized classes at any faculty) took money to a higher education institution for budget places.</i>  <i>In return, they receive certain benefits for admission (to a budget place!), Which you will agree, looks like a property qualification, which is not very good for the ‚Äúaccessibility‚Äù of education.</i> <br><br>  To implement objectivity, the following was done: 
      <br>
        <script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>
        <ins class="adsbygoogle"

          data-ad-format="fluid"

      <strong>1. Differentiation of types of tasks.</strong> <br><br>  Tasks are divided into three types.  All three types simultaneously belonged to one KIM (personal set of personal exam questions for graduates who do not overlap with anyone in the class). <br><br>  <strong>Type (section) A.</strong> Easy, setting the type of test. <br>  <b>By the way: the</b> <i>main part of the criticism fell on the test part, it was said that the test does not provide an objective assessment of the student, etc.</i>  <i>although the main task of this part is to ensure that the troechnik received his well-earned top three, and those who need more could decide the next part of the KIM.</i> <br><br>  <strong>Type (section) B.</strong> Medium, type task, insert the desired word, number, etc.  It is designed for students who not only can memorize factual material (I‚Äôm talking about exact sciences), but also know how to solve typical problems. <br><br>  <strong>Type (section) C.</strong> Difficult, you need to write not only the answer of the problem, but bring the complete solution in writing (this is for excellent students who have seriously set their sights on the university). <br><br>  <strong>2. Avoiding the human factor in the assessment.</strong>  To this end, the division of the handing over, controlling, transporting and evaluating tasks was introduced. <br>  The chain of KIM transmission in the region is approximately as follows: <br>   (regional information processing center) -&gt; Authorized representative -&gt;  (point of the exam) -&gt; Student -&gt;  (point of the exam) -&gt; Authorized representative -&gt; I.  KIM package sealed, open without damage is very difficult.  All packages are transferred for painting - spoiled are recorded.  Attempt to intervene from outside is easily detected. <br><br>  <strong>Personal experience:</strong> <em>One authorized person in the same year decided to check this at his own risk, risk, and material gain.</em>  <em>Discovered quickly.</em>  <em>Beat long.</em> <br><br>  <strong>By the way:</strong> <em>As a rule, the exam is not held in your own school, there are (controlled) teachers not from your school.</em>  <em>So there‚Äôs no reason to tell them to give in.</em> <br><br>  Upon arrival at the RCSE, the already replied KIMs scan all answer sheets. <br>  Part A is checked almost without human intervention tests are automatically recognized. <br>  Part B is pre-checked by verifiers (they ensure that groups of characters are recognized correctly).  Answers are grouped and evaluated by experts - subject teachers (allows you to consider that the correct answer "kochet" and "rooster" is the same). <br>  Part C is tested exclusively by subject experts.  Like a regular written exam. <br><br>  <strong>By the way:</strong> <em>In Part C and B, tasks are checked more than once, and not by one expert.</em>  <em>That allows to level the possible error of the expert in the assessment.</em>  <em>In addition, the experts do not know whose answer they are checking, so the probability of juggling the results here is also minimal.</em> <br><br>  In addition, the base of answers thus accumulates, for which, using statistical methods, it is possible to identify "wrong questions" in the questions themselves, which allows us to improve their quality every year ... <br><br>  <b>Total:</b> <br>  There is nothing in the implementation or in the ideology of the Unified State Examination that would be directed against the student, on the contrary, this system aims to objectively divide students according to their abilities. <br><br>  If there are questions, doubts, attempts to point out the ‚Äúbottlenecks‚Äù of the USE - I will be glad to answer, discuss.  Because  despite the fact that the experiment is no longer an experiment - the myths are still alive. <br><br>  <b>UPD:</b> An important addition from the user <a href="https://megamozg.ru/users/bat/" class="user_link">bat</a> , regarding what exactly is the resulting score on the exam. <br>  I quote his post: <br><blockquote>  The Unified State Exam is not a method of assessment, but a method of ranking the examinees and it copes with it. <br>  By points it is impossible to compare two people who passed at different times, because the ranking is done on the mass of those who passed at the same time. <br></blockquote></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/62054/">https://habr.com/ru/post/62054/</a></p>
