  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Idea for a startup: Recruitment</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  The idea of ‚Äã‚Äãthe project is that the customer is selected staff in accordance with its requirements for qualifications and other criteria. <br><br><h3>  I'll start with the problem. </h3><br>  I needed a PHP programmer. <br>  Question: Where to look for it? <br>  Answer: On the sites of work, in the section "work" on Habr√©. <br>  OK, what is the probability that it will suit me?  What does he have that experience?  Have those skills?  None, except information from the summary.  But we all know how it is compiled, as a result, it turns out that before finding a person, you need to talk to him, find out, etc. <br>  The project offers all the work to take on.  The customer puts forward WHAT he needs, the project itself finds the person, interviews and provides the customer. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  This is not another site about freelancers. <br><br>  The model consists in the fact that there are N - persons who submit an application for registration, after which the site administration performs testing of a person, that is, these are tests in C ++, PHP, C #, not only about programmers, if it is SEO or Website Design, then make up tests for them.  In almost every profession there are questions by the answers of which one can judge about the knowledge of the subject area. 
      <br>
        <script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>
        <ins class="adsbygoogle"
          style="display:block; text-align:center;"
          data-ad-layout="in-article"
          data-ad-format="fluid"
          data-ad-client="ca-pub-6974184241884155"

          (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
        </script>
      <br>
      Thus, after testing and communicating with a person, it becomes known what he knows, and what is the price of his work per month ‚Äî the overall picture of the person becomes known. <br><br><h3>  How it works </h3><br>  A customer comes in and says: I need a team of people, namely: 4 PHP developers, 2 designers, 1 flash developer. <br><br>  Everything, from this moment the project starts to work, for the services the fee from the customer is withdrawn, for example in the amount of 3000r. <br>  After that, the administration works with the customer in more detail, in order to understand who he needs and provides the workers after talking with people. <br><br>  Thus, there will be a base of people (not very large) that knows how, knows something, and wants to work. <br><br><h3>  Results </h3><br>  Using this model we get advantages from the sides: <br>  1) From the side of the customer - there is no need to scour the network, just go to the site, talk with the administration, tell what the customer wants.  In the end, the administration provides workers. <br>  2) From the side of the staff - having passed the selection on the site, you can be sure that soon someone will need your job, this is not freelancer.ru :) <br>  3) The overall picture - a project for the selection of high-quality staff in the network. <br><br>  You may have a question: what if the customer does not like the staff, well, there will be something to do, in which case you need to make a refund.  Partial refund, because the work of the administration must also be paid, for example, from 2000 rubles a return of 2000 rubles. <br><br>  And this is convenient for the customer, there is confidence in the honesty that even if it does not work, there will be a refund, even if partial.  It must be understood this is normal. <br><br>  In general, such an idea, I think it is worthy of attention. <br>  And I think it can be implemented and work on it. <br>  Yes, it is not easy. <br>  Yes, this is not a quick project. <br>  But this project can bring benefits and money. <br><br>  Waiting for your comments. <br>  Especially interested please unsubscribe me in the PM. <br><br>  <b>OBN</b> : kammenty good, the model is really not perfect, however, if someone wants to say something - comment <br>  Thanks to all! <br></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/63761/">https://habr.com/ru/post/63761/</a></p>
