There are so many beautiful things in the world at the same time.

      And no matter how wild it may sound, but against the background of all this negativity some beautiful things seem even more beautiful ... More noticeable!  They stand out in a surprising way from their surroundings and acquire meaning.  Remember at least that famous photo of a kiss against the background of unrest in Vancouver! <br>  Do not be there an angry mob, inverted cars and police with batons, did this photo remain equally noticeable?  Has it circled the whole world?  Love against the backdrop of a great tragedy ... How many Oscars at one time received the ‚ÄúTitanic‚Äù, balancing on the emotions of the audience? <br><br>  But there is another category of beautiful things.  Which are good just by themselves.  Without politics, disasters and riots. <br>  For example, the story of Matthew Harding, or rather his not intricate dance, which spread all over the world and about which I would like to tell today.  Surely, many people have already heard about him, and if not, welcome under cat. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  This story began in 2003, when he was 26 years old.  He worked as a video game designer and once, suddenly, he decided that he wanted to see the world.  He quit, and with the money he was able to save, he set off on a journey, where he took along an old camera with the function of shooting video. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/57d/e64/453/57de64453f1d60417ccfd72f32dc7915.jpg"><br><br>  It seems to be nothing special, many people travel with a camera.  But Matt decided to abandon the usual filming of attractions.  At first, as a joke, and then purposefully, he began to dance in front of the camera in all interesting places of the world, where he came.  And often, it was not hackneyed sights, which can be seen in all tourist avenues. <br>  The resulting video he posted on his own page, which was called <a href="http://www.wherethehellismatt.com/">WhereTheHellIsMatt.com</a> ("Where the hell is Matt?"). <br><br>  And all would be okay, but in 2005 he finds his videos on Youtube, where a teenager posted them, passing off as his own.  By the time they were already very popular.  A few months later, the American company Stride, which produced chewing gum, offered Matt to make another trip, which she was willing to sponsor.  And Matt gladly accepted their offer. <br><br>  At this time, almost a year of travel, he visited 35 countries, 5 continents.  And he danced no longer alone!  Thanks to the first video, he became popular and people from all over the world began to write him with proposals to dance with him.  Although, of course, in Africa or New Guinea, he himself had to look for a company for dancing. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/d78/6e9/5d0/d786e95d09450aa7d94b3dba0a189462.jpg"><br><br>  In any case, as a result, it seems to me, something really good, kind and beautiful has turned out.  Real emotions, joy and happiness.  Different countries, different people.  Rich, poor, black, white ... Everyone just rejoices and dances.  They are the same as we, and we are the same as they.  And this is great!  Without politics, without borders!  The whole world in 5 minutes! <br><br>  If you have not watched his videos, then by all means take a look!  If a smile appears on your face, Matt did it all for nothing: <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/zlfKdbWwruY%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700023,15700043,15700186,15700190,15700253,15700256&amp;usg=ALkJrhhlQh3zbja09wa0OtYwh8aVKpv1tg" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br><h4>  Why is it on Habr√©? </h4><br><br>  Matt is a former video game designer.  Completely ordinary without any outstanding abilities.  It is unlikely that he can be called the owner of unique external data.  In part, he is the same as most of us.  Ordinary person.  But one day he just got up from the computer and realized his dream. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/18f/144/987/18f1449877a2c57d77a3cbfe5b0d4cc7.jpg"><br><br>  How often do we postpone our dream until later, perhaps never having realized it?  How often do we grab at the usual way of things home-work-home-work?  Matt's example is an example of a person who has fulfilled his dream by breaking this order.  Perhaps for some, this example will be useful along with freelancing stories from Thailand or GOA.  And we, say, in a year, we will see new, no less interesting stories of someone from habro users, which began with today's post. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/170707/">https://habr.com/ru/post/170707/</a></p>
