      <b>Chapter 13. Bright advertising ideas.</b> <br><br>  A short chapter in which I would like to focus your attention on the fact that at the present time, when resources of all sorts and different subjects on the Internet are just a lot and the competition is huge, then, wishing your project to earn money, it‚Äôs not enough to hang out a sign ‚Äúbuy banner".  This is not the case for many advertisers, and even RA.  Already interested in all sorts of non-standard advertising solutions.  Here Habr himself is ahead of the rest of the world - there is something to learn.  Here and blogs of companies (I also try to introduce this kind of income in myself, but ... so far with difficulty), and recalculation of the Habr-user rating in QIWI-money, and toys from Sony Eriksson and ... But what to list is all before everyone‚Äôs eyes.  I have here 86 (at that time) Qiwi-ruble at the expense of my wallet, I spit it out))) I mean, with advertising, advertising, but an approach;  catchy, effective, interesting and effective.  Advertisers are delighted, the gods of Habr are not offended too clearly.  And many, albeit well-attended, IT-directed resources, other things being equal, may also miss advertisers, who prefer cunning, and maybe viral advertising campaign on a simple 240x400 banner in Habr ... <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  <i>Tip 13:</i> invent and offer advertisers all sorts of interesting options for advertising campaigns.  I can‚Äôt say that my idea is, but now it‚Äôs on the autotourist that it‚Äôs exactly that the advertising <u>special</u> project, and not just a banner, say.  Yes, the banner is present, the logo in the menu bar of the second level, where do without it ... But!  Some elements of the site were painted in the corporate color of the Garmin company, <a href="http://vkontakte.ru/club9824026">the VKontakte group</a> began to paint the banner, and, most importantly, before the eyes of the most potential customers of the navigators, the spectacular Garmin auto-navigation showcase was painted - just choose what your heart and soul wants, read In the reports, reviews of real auto-travelers about the experience of using Garmin navigators and ... Buy your device right in the window of your favorite site, for nothing, that they will deliver it to your house! -) <br><br>  By the way, it would be just <u>mega interesting</u> if someone from respected habra people experienced in advertising (and among us there are, of course, very, very much) would spend some time and share their experience on the topic in the comments to this topic. all sorts of different options for advertising campaigns (maybe something someone peeped at the bourgeoisie, somewhere else; someone invented something himself and successfully implemented).  In the comments to one of the parts of my advice, by the way, they shared with me the experience of using one portal to the village of an unknown tool for me to unscrew user advertising in special text ad units with the option of paying with cards and via SMS.  I took a note and, most likely, somehow experiment.  But this is only a tool of mass monetization, though, no doubt, interesting in its own way.  But some ideas for special advertising projects for large customers would be very interesting;  here it is a matter of pure creativity, IMHO, and inspiration, but not everyone and always ‚Äúhas it‚Äù, and the experience and ideas of others would be simply invaluable! <br><br>  <b>Chapter 14. Not a single advertisement ...</b> <br><br>  But yes, as I wrote in the last part about all kinds of affiliate programs there, etc., not only advertisers can bring you income from your project.  How do you, for example, the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãa themed online store?  Yes, the idea is as old as the world, but if you have a little entrepreneurial attitude, it is potentially very, very grim.  Unfortunately, I have neither the strength, nor the agility, nor the time before my move to a new place of residence in Sweden was enough to fully organize the process of functioning of my <a href="http://avtoturistu.ru/shop">online store of</a> goods (auto) tourist orientation, but what is the potential, mmm ... By chance and circumstance , the shop is ‚Äúconserved‚Äù, but, I am sure, sooner or later, with my own efforts or with someone else's efforts, he will find a second life!  ;-) <br><br>  <i>Tip 14:</i> Trade!  Thematic community - these are the target buyers of those goods that are necessary for it to implement its tasks.  Community theme = store theme.  Caesar, as they say, Caesar's, and to the locksmith - locksmith, but that and that "it" should be-)) <br><br>  <b>Chapter 15. Strengthening the community.</b> <br><br>  Well, actually, here!  Your community is racing, breathing and gaining momentum.  You are already getting the desired surplus from it.  It's time to celebrate this event, but!  Something boring, isn't it?  -) <br><br>  When enough time, in your opinion, has passed since the start of the community, and it has already formed a kind of ‚Äúcore audience‚Äù that regularly writes, responds to topics and comments and is, in fact, the driving force of the project, then it would be good Offline to organize a meeting of its members.  Of course, this action can be implemented only on the condition that a large part of your community lives in one city so that it is technically possible to meet.  Here, for example, <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/users/ort/" class="user_link">ort</a> , the founding father of <a href="http://livestreetcms.com/">CMS Livestreet</a> (at which my <a href="http://avtoturistu.ru/">Avtoturistu.Rf</a> works), has twice ‚Äú <a href="http://livestreet.ru/blog/dev_livestreet/3956.html">walked</a> ‚Äù the members of the <a href="http://www.livestreet.ru/">www.livestreet.ru</a> community in offline meetings in Moscow (I was at both) and, as far as I I can see, <a href="http://livestreet.ru/search/topics/%3Fq%3D%25D0%25B2%25D1%2581%25D1%2582%25D1%2580%25D0%25B5%25D1%2587%25D0%25B0">planned</a> and more meetings in different cities.  We met, got to know each other personally, communicated, shared experiences, made various suggestions for improving the engine functionality and te te te te te te.  What am I for? <br><br>  When people who communicate online every day get acquainted with each other in a real situation, this, in my opinion, is simply super as it strengthens the relations of these people and allows them to continue, by communicating again online, to be already more friendly and open to each other.  Plus, if people are all completely positive, united by common interests (interest is the subject of the community), and the meeting went off with a bang, then all those who visited it will wait for the next meeting, tell their friends and friends who have similar interests, but not yet registered members of the community.  This, in turn, will also greatly increase the loyalty of both the already established ‚Äúcore of the audience‚Äù and potential community members who will join it thanks to the ‚Äúliveliness‚Äù of this community (well, I mean, the platform is not just a base of ‚Äúanswers‚Äù ‚Äã‚Äã- boring and gray, but also ‚Äúlive‚Äù, drinking beer and having fun not only in front of the monitor screens, but also in nature / in taverns, etc.). <br><br>  <i>Tip 15:</i> Not only tiny communities should and can be selected offline.  I myself am not a member of Lepreta, but my former colleague told me that I went to some kind of sortie (play paintball) of Lepre participants.  Anyway, the entire honest table "users" of the database of your project (even if it is a Leprecha) with all the desire does not express a desire to be at the meeting and, IMHO, the composition of participants is appointed on a certain day of the week, at a certain time and a certain place, and with a certain format of the meeting will not go off-scale and exceed a two-digit number ... -) <br><br>  How was it in my case?  So I decided to finally collect all our honest company, created a <a href="http://avtoturistu.ru/blog/avtoturizm/1293.html">topic-invitation</a> .  I counted on a person from the strength of 10-12, who would express a desire to meet in the tavern with our auto-touring party.  But the result exceeded all expectations, which was incredibly cool!  <a href="http://avtoturistu.ru/blog/avtoturizm/1325.html"><b>REPORT</b></a> <br><br>  Summary: arrange for possible meetings in real life of the members of your community.  The meeting is almost 100% doomed to be successful, because everyone is united by a common interest, and this, if you please, 90% of the success in communication.  In the case of the meeting of my community, as can be seen from the <a href="http://avtoturistu.ru/blog/avtoturizm/1325.html">report</a> , everyone is not just satisfied, but literally was delighted with the event and agreed to by all means always meet again and again!  -) <br><br>  Greetings from <a href="http://goo.gl/maps/em4K">Uppsala</a> , Anton. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/111148/">https://habr.com/ru/post/111148/</a></p>
