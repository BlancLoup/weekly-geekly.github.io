It was especially hard for the customers of Boxberry and SPSR-Express, which even had to suspend delivery from some online stores. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/3f6/47d/c98/3f647dc984d4f64a04bdd2666f324a5e.jpg" alt="image"><br>  <i>No passport scan anywhere</i> <br><br>  Good news right away: <a href="https://meduza.io/cards/dlya-dostavki-onlayn-pokupok-teper-nuzhen-skan-pasporta-eto-pravda">according to Medusa</a> , on January 7, the check ended and the FCS stopped requesting additional documents from companies.

    <h2>  What was it </h2><br>  It turns out that according to the rules of the Federal Customs Service, when ordering a parcel from abroad, you must provide the carrier with scans of passport pages with basic data and registration. <a name="habracut"></a>  At least, that is what they meant by "information about the identity document of the recipient of the goods."  This interpretation was not obvious to all carriers, therefore some companies asked for scans of only the first turn of the passport or were limited to a series and number.  And when the January inspection of the FCS began, they had to urgently request from their clients scans of passports or even cancel delivery. <br><br>  It turns out, contrary to the <a href="http://www.rbc.ru/business/08/01/2017/58720bf29a7947dc9b1b9f36">heading of RBC</a> , the customs officers did not ‚Äúbegin to demand passport data,‚Äù but began to check whether all of them were provided.  <a href="https://rns.online/it-and-media/-Tamozhnya-obyasnila-novogodnie-problemi-s-dostavkoi-posilok-viborochnimi-proverkami-2017-01-09/">According to customs officials</a> , the entire inspection covered less than 1% of cross-border parcels. <br><br><h2>  A spoon of tar </h2><br>  However, everything is not so trivial.  Kommersant let the market representatives <a href="http://www.kommersant.ru/doc/3186788">speak</a> , and they are predictably dissatisfied - mainly with the unpredictability of officials: <br><br><blockquote>  Vyacheslav Sarkisov, head of the international development department at Pony Express, says that the Federal Customs Service has not warned of more stringent verification of documents.  According to him, this measure "contradicts the previously stated policy of transition from total control to selective control."  ‚ÄúTherefore, all express carriers engaged in cross-border delivery experienced difficulties in carrying out customs clearance of goods from foreign online stores,‚Äù he explained. </blockquote><br>  It is easier to understand business than customs: by analogy with the traffic police, if you want to reduce accidents and real violations of the law, you will make the traffic police post as visible and noticeable as possible.  If your goal is to catch more offenders and collect more fines, then you will hide with a radar in the bushes.  But at this time, drivers will continue to exceed and create emergencies. <br><br>  If the FCS was concerned with the legality, then it would be more correct to warn about the check and give all companies time to adjust their procedures to the customs rules.  But the customs officers did as they did, and as a result the market became tense, and a certain number of recipients were left without their parcels or were delayed. <br><br>  2017 promises to be a year when purchases from abroad will continue to be cut into pieces.  This year, the EAEU Customs Code should be adopted - and then in 2018 the threshold for duty-free entry <a href="https://geektimes.ru/company/pochtoy/blog/283440/">will be</a> halved to ‚Ç¨ 500 per month (over this amount the duty will be 30%, but not less than 4 euros per 1 kg), and another year later - up to 200 euros (with a duty on top of 15%, but not less than 2 euros). <br><br>  This year they are planning, even if it is not clear how, to introduce VAT on purchases from abroad - for digital goods, as we know, VAT is already valid from the first of January, but everything is a bit more complicated with packages, because it‚Äôs proposed to take VAT on those who, in principle, are not eager to deal with buyers from Russia (and to circumvent the limitations of which, in particular, our mail <a href="http://pochtoy.com/%3Flang%3Drus%26utm_source%3Dgeektimes%26utm_medium%3Dpost%26utm_campaign%3Dgeeks16">forwarder</a> Pochtoy.com is <a href="http://pochtoy.com/%3Flang%3Drus%26utm_source%3Dgeektimes%26utm_medium%3Dpost%26utm_campaign%3Dgeeks16">needed</a> . <br><br>  And the ‚ÄúRussian Post‚Äù demanded that the parcels to Russia be sorted by destination regions even in the country of departure - we <a href="https://geektimes.ru/company/pochtoy/blog/283712/">also wrote</a> about the delusional nature of this requirement. <br><br>  In general, all this fits into the logic of the nightmare of the market for private purchases abroad.  Power and lobbyists want us to buy either domestic or from dealers.  Just now, sudden checks were added to the announced threats. <br><br><h2>  How are customers of Pochtoy.com </h2><br>  This check has not affected our clients in any way, because we have long been providing scans of their passports to courier companies with which we cooperate.  Including the ‚ÄúBoxberry‚Äù, which the check took by surprise - we didn‚Äôt have to request anything from our customers. <br><br>  <i><b>Buy while you can:</b></i> <br> <a href="http://pochtoy.com/%3Flang%3Drus%26utm_source%3Dgeektimes%26utm_medium%3Dpost%26utm_campaign%3Dgeeks16"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/91a/388/404/91a3884042444f849c2fec2aa3d4cbce.png"></a> <br><br>  By tradition, the first order is a $ 5 discount on the <b>supergeek</b> promo code. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/400645/">https://habr.com/ru/post/400645/</a></p>
