To understand what Facebook looks like, you don‚Äôt need to go far - the simplest and uncomplicated example is the social network <a href="http://vkontakte.ru/">Vkontakte.ru</a> .  However, making the background, logo and some features similar to facebook does not mean becoming one.  After all, only on facebook you will find more than 1,200 applications in the chat category, more than 2,600 games, as well as a huge variety of applications sorted by category. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Alerts, business, already mentioned chat, announcements, meetings, education, events, fashion, sharing of access to files, food and drinks, games (by the way on the same VKontakte, they are required by the whole group, threatening almost with the deletion of their own accounts) , entertainment, messaging (in case you lack a <a href="http://www.facebook.com/presence/popout.php">built-in chat</a> , reminiscent of the web version of google talk), as well as various mobile phone applications, for example <a href="http://www.facebook.com/apps/application.php%3Fid%3D2462551974%26amp%3Bb%3D%26amp%3Bref%3Dpd">My Ringtone</a> - allows you to create and distribute your tunes, or you want to tell the world what kind of phone  amy the best?  <a href="http://www.facebook.com/apps/application.php%3Fid%3D5005888210%26amp%3Bb%3D%26amp%3Bref%3Dpd">Please</a> , or you need to send an SMS to a mobile phone - <a href="http://www.facebook.com/apps/application.php%3Fid%3D26656565693%26amp%3Bb%3D%26amp%3Bref%3Dpd">there is nothing simpler</a> , even in facebook there are about 400 hundred applications in one degree or another related to finance, as well as more than 1200 applications in the music section with the help of which you can share an interesting <a href="http://www.facebook.com/apps/application.php%3Fid%3D2513891999%26amp%3Bb%3D%26amp%3Bref%3Dpd">clip with YouTube</a> , or <a href="http://www.facebook.com/apps/application.php%3Fid%3D2413267546%26amp%3Bb%3D%26amp%3Bref%3Dpd">music</a> - everything is in your hands, the only thing you need is to choose an application that you really like.  The photography rubric is filled with 1000 applications, there was a place for politics - more than 700 applications are waiting for new Medvedev and Zhirinovsky, athletes are also in honor for facebook on them more than 2000 applications, travelers will also be happy with applications - for example, using <a href="http://www.facebook.com/apps/application.php%3Fid%3D7747835805%26amp%3Bb%3D%26amp%3Bref%3Dpd">iEat</a> you will become a real censor of any cafes and restaurants. <br><br><img src="http://ad28.ru/wp-content/uploads/2008/05/ddf3pb2d_62vvn8d6c2_b.jpg" alt="undefined">

      There are almost 1900 applications related to the ‚Äúuseful‚Äù category and be sure that they really correspond to the category.  Could you at least dream that the RSS feed of your blog or other site will be displayed on your profile on VKontakte?  Naturally not, maximum mean link!  Everything on Facebook is completely different - you just need to install the <a href="http://www.facebook.com/apps/application.php%3Fid%3D5315590686%26amp%3Bb%3D%26amp%3Bref%3Dpd">Blog RSS Feed Reader</a> application and the address of the RSS feed is set - EVERYTHING, now links to your posts will be displayed in your profile, you want to make a wish list in your profile, so that your friends would know that you give for the New Year or birthday, <a href="http://www.facebook.com/apps/application.php%3Fid%3D5892611090%26amp%3Bb%3D%26amp%3Bref%3Dpd">why not</a> , you still lack the application functionality, do you want to insert something of your own on the profile page?  <a href="http://www.facebook.com/apps/application.php%3Fid%3D2372101981%26amp%3Bb%3D%26amp%3Bref%3Dpd">Flag in your hands</a> , you can insert not only plain text or a picture, but also a video from YouTube or some other services. <br><br><img src="http://ad28.ru/wp-content/uploads/2008/05/ddf3pb2d_64g2wbhthr_b.jpg" alt="undefined"><br><br>  By the way, the developers also do not sit still, developing and complementing their services - for example, facebook has its own <a href="http://developers.facebook.com/toolbar/">toolbar for firefox</a> , with which you can not only search on facebook, but also follow all the updates on the site. <br><br>  In a word, once on Facebook, you‚Äôll linger on it for a long time ‚Äî at least to try all the apps on yourself.  The only thing that upsets a little is the number of Russian-speaking population on the site, on VKontakte, which is not surprising, in this respect it is much ahead.  And for a social network, the presence of users associated with you even interests, even a place of study or work is very important - for that she and the network.  Pleased with the initiatives in the Russification of the interface.  Apparently, Russian users who do not speak English will soon have a place to turn around. <br><br>  <strong><font color="#0099FF">Bonus to this post: Top 10 Facebook Applications</font></strong> <br><br>  <strong>1. <a href="http://apps.facebook.com/friendfeed/">friendfeed</a></strong> <br><img alt="undefined" src="http://ad28.ru/wp-content/uploads/2008/05/logo-b-copy.jpg"><br>  The application that was one of the first to appear on my facebook profile became a <a href="http://apps.facebook.com/friendfeed/">friendfeed</a> , this is a live stream service for aggregating and reading your and other people's RSS feeds.  Somehow I <a href="http://ad28.ru/%3Fp%3D133">mentioned about him</a> . <br>  In the application for facebook you can do everything that you could do on the site of the service itself, so this is a great gift for all fans of friendfeed.  Well, for everyone else who for some reason is not registered as a friendfeed, but I want to read some kind of RSS from the profile page I recommend looking <a href="http://www.facebook.com/apps/index.php%3Fq%3Drss">here</a> - there are more than enough applications. <br><br>  <strong>2. <a href="http://apps.facebook.com/ilike/">iLike</a></strong> <br><img alt="undefined" src="http://ad28.ru/wp-content/uploads/2008/05/ddf3pb2d_67fvjchmd3_b.gif"><br>  <a href="http://apps.facebook.com/ilike/">iLike</a> - This app is one of the most popular on Facebook!  Of course, because with the help of it you can not only tell the whole world about those artists that you like, but also show their clip or put in your profile the song you like.  By the way, the creators of the ILike application are the developers of a competitor <a href="http://www.lastfm.ru/">lastf.m</a> - <a href="http://ilike.com/">ilike.com</a> , and this application shows some of the possible functions on the ilike network site itself. But the last.fm already mentioned is not far behind - it has the same way as ilike Your facebook app is Last.fm Music, but unlike ilike apps, you need to register on last.fm. <br><br>  <strong>3. <a href="http://www.facebook.com/apps/application.php%3Fid%3D2425101550%26amp%3Bb">Top Friends</a></strong> <br><img alt="undefined" src="http://ad28.ru/wp-content/uploads/2008/05/ddf3pb2d_75hmk264gx_b.jpg"><br>  Another of the most popular apps on my list and on the facebook site is <a href="http://www.facebook.com/apps/application.php%3Fid%3D2425101550%26amp%3Bb">Top Friends</a> .  It creates a three-dimensional list of all your best friends.  What is it for?  Just usually, by going to your profile, you are watching updates from your friends and first of all from those who are the best, but facebook itself cannot determine who is the best for you and who is so familiar.  That's why you do it yourself with the help of this application. <br>  Top Friends - This is not only time optimization, because one click will separate you from your best friend, not a link to search, as in the standard facebook interface, but also a good way to show your friends how you feel about them.  You can give each of your friends a title, for example, the most romantic or the most athletic, the hottest, in general, the MTV international award, in addition to everything else you can send your friends a virtual drink using the Top Friends application, and also set your mood when the help of very funny smiles, and it‚Äôs natural to tell all your friends about this. <br><br>  <strong>4. <a href="http://www.facebook.com/apps/application.php%3Fid%3D2439131959">Graffiti</a></strong> <br><img alt="undefined" src="http://ad28.ru/wp-content/uploads/2008/05/ddf3pb2d_72cjczgkgc_b.jpg"><br>  The application that was so beautifully turned over on the VKontakte website - <a href="http://www.facebook.com/apps/application.php%3Fid%3D2439131959">Graffiti</a> , plays the role of your wall with pictures, there is a special public gallery in which any user can vote for a particular picture.  By the way, as with other applications on facebook, <a href="http://www.facebook.com/apps/application.php%3Fid%3D2439131959">Graffiti</a> has analogues!  For example, an application with a similar <a href="http%253A%252F%252Fwww.facebook.com%252Fapps%252Fapplication.php%253Fid%253D2357293998%2526ref%253Ds%26amp%3Bk%3D40000000020">name</a> differs from its parent in comments to pictures, a save button and a normal repetition, as well as a few more <a href="http://www.facebook.com/s.php%3Fq%3DGraffiti%26amp%3Bk%3D40000000020">applications</a> that will allow your work to be released onto the Internet. <br><br>  5. <a href="http://www.facebook.com/apps/application.php%3Fid%3D2374336051%26amp%3Bb">Extended Info</a> <br>  Using the <a href="http://www.facebook.com/apps/application.php%3Fid%3D2374336051%26amp%3Bb">Extended Info</a> application, you can add any information about yourself to your profile.  This application is suitable for those people who lack standard information to enter information, but on the other side of its function is almost infinity - you can not only tell what you like, where you are, what you do, what you don‚Äôt like, who you hate and so on, but you can also add videos from U-tub, as well as insert an RSS feed.  As a result, this application immediately replaces a number of additions, which is already good.  After all, if your profile is overloaded, different applications of different kinds - then it will be avoided, and why do we still need applications, how not to show it to all visitors of your profile. <br><br>  <strong>6. <a href="http://apps.facebook.com/liveblog">Live Blog</a></strong> <br><img alt="undefined" src="http://ad28.ru/wp-content/uploads/2008/05/ddf3pb2d_718j7dhxg3_b.gif"><br>  Many are not satisfied with the functionality of Facebook notes.  Too simple!  Especially for these people, the <a href="http://apps.facebook.com/liveblog">Live Blog</a> application was developed, which will turn your notes into almost real LJ. <br>  You can not only write a regular post, but also set your mood, as well as add a video from YouTube or google.video and write the music that plays at the time of writing the post.  With the help of this application you can also follow other authors of such blogs.  In addition, Live Blog supports Html-code, which means that you can add videos from other services, flash and photos - it would be a desire.  The developers will soon attach the RSS and download images, so you just have to wait. <br><br>  <strong>7. <a href="http://apps.facebook.com/bunnyfight/">Pets</a></strong> <br><img alt="undefined" src="http://ad28.ru/wp-content/uploads/2008/05/ddf3pb2d_77xkvdgqc6_b.jpg"><br>  For all Pokemon fans and tamogyches on Facebook there is a <a href="http://apps.facebook.com/bunnyfight/">Pets</a> application, with which you can create your rabbit, pump it using the local currency, which you can earn on duels, invitations of other users to the game, as well as for installing other applications in your profile .  As in any similar game, you will find an incredible amount of various bells and whistles for your rabbit; if you like, you can try on not only computer opponents (Beetles), but also other rabbits.  In general, a very entertaining time killer for office workers.  But for those who feel sorry for the little rabbits, there is a good old <a href="http://www.facebook.com/apps/application.php%3Fid%3D5059278562">Mario</a> on Facebook.  True, he, unlike Pets, is not so social, implemented on a flash using the <a href="http://www.widgetbox.com/">Widgetbox</a> , but worth playing.  If you and Mario did not like it, go to the section of the game, there will definitely be something interesting for you. <br><br>  <strong>8. <a href="http://apps.facebook.com/todolist/">Task Master</a></strong> <br><img alt="undefined" src="http://ad28.ru/wp-content/uploads/2008/05/ddf3pb2d_69fsd8xhds_b.jpg"><br>  <a href="http://apps.facebook.com/todolist/">Task Master</a> - This application is suitable for those who value their time and someone else.  With it, you can keep your so-called todo list on the site.  GTD lovers and other life hackers will appreciate this app.  After all, this is not a simple task list with parameters done / not done, but an advanced task scheduler, for each item on your todo list you can set the date, category, description, as well as the significance of the task, its completion and most probably important - will it be this task is public or visible only to you, and if you wish, you can invite your friends or work colleagues, naturally registered on facebook, to view and edit.  If Task Master does not suit you for reasons, there are <a href="http://www.facebook.com/apps/index.php%3Fq%3Dgtd">some</a> <a href="http://www.facebook.com/apps/index.php%3Fq%3Dtodo">more</a> interesting applications for working with task lists on facebook, the only thing that is required of you is to find time to search for an application that suits you completely. <br><br>  <strong>9. <a href="http://apps.facebook.com/files/">Files</a></strong> <br><img alt="undefined" src="http://ad28.ru/wp-content/uploads/2008/05/ddf3pb2d_73hdbbrmd7_b.gif"><br>  The <a href="http://apps.facebook.com/files/">Files</a> app allows you to share any files with your friends from facebook.  As you might have guessed from the picture, this is an application, the development of <a href="http://box.net/">box.net</a> file storage and in principle you can do everything with it on the hosting site itself. <br>  You are provided with 1 gigabyte for your music, pictures, videos and everything else that you decide to post on the Internet, besides, you can brag of these files to your friends - putting them in your profile, as well as share the link with someone.  A little offended that before downloading you will have to register on the box itself, although for example in Ilike everything is immediately available. <br><br>  <strong>10. <a href="http://www.facebook.com/apps/application.php%3Fid%3D2345673396">Hug Me</a></strong> <br><img alt="undefined" src="http://ad28.ru/wp-content/uploads/2008/05/ddf3pb2d_76q4hgv2g8_b.jpg"><br>  And completes our list app <a href="http://www.facebook.com/apps/application.php%3Fid%3D2345673396">Hug Me</a> , though not as useful as all the others from this list, for the popular and interesting.  With the help of Hug me in, you can show your attitude to your friends using coolly drawn icons with inscriptions.  You will be able to give your friend a cold beer, drawn, but still, hug him by clicking on the icon with a cute hamster, in general, show some kind of emotion, of course, on the one hand - this approach increasingly removes people from each other, but on the other hand, when your friend (or girlfriend) is very far away from you, I really want to show these or other emotions that you simply cannot convey with text.  By the way, along with positive emotions with the help of Hug Me, you can also transmit negative ones, so you can transfer a savory kick, slap, put a footboard, but still - the choice of positive emotions is much more.  All emotions, whether they are conveyed to you or you, will be displayed in the history on the page of your facebook profile, so that everyone would see how you feel about a person and how people feel about you.  You can also block unwanted users who bother you with their kicks or liters of beer - that‚Äôs how life would be easy, wouldn't it? <br><br>  On this sad note I‚Äôm finishing my Top 10 applications for facebook.  This top does not claim objectivity in the last resort and for the most part I was based only on my opinion, as well as on the popularity of the application in facebook itself.  By the way, if you know any other applications that you really like, then do not hesitate - write in the comments to this post.  It will be interesting and useful for all of us! <br><br>  <font>Posted by: <a href="http://geektimes.ru/users/ice_dog_as/" class="user_link">ice_dog_as</a></font> <br>  <strong>via <a href="http://ad28.ru/%3Fp%3D275"><font>AD28.ru</font></a></strong> <br><br></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/25895/">https://habr.com/ru/post/25895/</a></p>
