Do not limit your capabilities to a narrow specialization - specialize in general in life. <br><br>  2. Do not overload the desktop.  It must always remain pristine, like a mountain peak.  It helps to feel higher than the working routine and maintain both clarity of thought and good spirits.

      3. Treat colleagues, subordinates, and customers as you would like to be treated. <br><br>  4. Answer every e-mail you receive, a phone call or fax on the same day, regardless of where you are and what you are doing. <br><br>  5. Before creating something tangible, ask yourself if there is any value or original idea in what you are going to do. <br><br>  6. Try to be aware of everything that concerns the current project.  Forget everything about the project, as soon as you start working on a new one. <br><br>  7. Never say: "I could do it."  After all, you did not. <br><br>  8. Remember: to be is to create.  (Heidegger) <br><br>  9. Reveal reality with surprises and "phenomenological" actions. <br><br>  10. Know that fate is always on your side. <br><br>  11. Watch everything that happens around you, every person, every moment in time.  And if you suddenly notice even the slightest clue, immediately start working. <br><br>  12. Work for fun, not for reward.  Or do not work at all. <br><br>  13. Bear in mind that if you and your friend have a fundamental divergence of views, then fruitful cooperation will fail, even if it seems to you that this is not the case. <br><br>  14. Be aware that not every project is promising. <br><br>  15. Everyone has strengths and weaknesses.  Work to make the first ones gradually become the last. <br><br>  16. If you understand that you are doing something bad, do something else. <br><br>  17. Avoid hoarding.  Try to maintain material balance - buying one new thing, get rid of one old one. <br><br>  18. If you do not like your work, quit. <br><br>  19. Store in a garberob thirty identical sets of underwear and thirty identical pairs of socks - and you will never have problems with the selection of a pair.  Once a month do laundry. <br><br>  20. Always carry only a credit card.  Do not carry with you "live" money. <br><br>  21. Remember: laziness is the Antichrist. <br><br>  22. Eat as little carbohydrates as possible.  Try not to go into pizzerias and bakeries. <br><br>  23. Do not resort to the help of shopping in the fight against depression.  Do not do the same thing and gluttony.  Know - this is the lot of housewives. <br><br>  24. Gain experience, not items. <br><br>  25. Set yourself a variety of tasks and do six things at once.  Only in this case you will never be bored. <br><br>  26. Try to avoid both verbally and in written language the following expressions: ‚Äútaste‚Äù, ‚Äúclass‚Äù, ‚Äúboredom‚Äù, ‚Äúugly‚Äù, ‚Äúmasses‚Äù. <br><br>  27. Finally, understand that the concept of ‚Äúpleasure‚Äù and what it means refers to the field of psychology rather than physiology. <br><br>  28. Minimalism is boring, but sensual minimalism is what we need. <br><br>  29. Try to realize: more means more. <br><br>  30. Try to be honest with yourself: normally does not mean good. <br><br>  31. Know that the form follows the subject in the same way as the object follows its purpose. <br><br>  32. Instead of dreaming about something, put it into practice. <br><br>  33. Treat new technologies with respect, even if you can not use them in everyday life. <br><br>  34. Never be content with what you did. <br><br>  35. Remember: perseverance, consistency and perseverance - these are the three main components of success. <br><br>  36. Do not think about fame, think about work. <br><br>  37. Always pay your bills - learn from others. <br><br>  38. There are only three categories of people: some produce culture, others buy it, and a third doesn't give a damn.  Always hold on to the first two. <br><br>  39. Do not even hesitate: work is life. <br><br>  40. Thoughts are wide, not deep. <br><br>  41. Thoughts relaxed, not tense. <br><br>  42. Know: omnia vincit amor.  (Love conquers all. - lat.) <br><br>  43. If you want the world to change, change it yourself.  (Gandhi) <br><br>  44. Before you make a final decision, carefully consider everything, consider everything once more. <br><br>  45. Constantly work on your life. <br><br>  46. ‚Äã‚ÄãComplement addition with subtraction. <br><br>  47. Experience is the most important part of life.  The exchange of ideas and human communication is the essence of existence. <br><br>  48. It is not a brand that creates products, but products creates a brand. <br><br>  49. The past is meaningless. <br><br>  50. Here and now - this is all that we have. <br><br>  Official site - <a href="http://www.karimrashid.com/">www.karimrashid.com</a> <br>  Store - <a href="http://karimrashidshop.com/">karimrashidshop.com</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/9036/">https://habr.com/ru/post/9036/</a></p>
