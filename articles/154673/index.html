  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Google has serious problems with Microsoft and antimonopoly from FTC</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Google has a very difficult period in the near future, which will begin in the late fall / early winter of this year.  The problems affect two areas - a patent tumor that has grown on the Android OS, and a serious investigation by the US Federal Trade Commission (FTC), which is looking for evidence of Google‚Äôs abuse of its monopoly position in the search engine market. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h4>  Android, Motorola Mobility and Microsoft </h4><br>  In Germany, where the court for intellectual property has the most simplified procedural procedure, the ‚Äúdaughter‚Äù of the search engine, Motorola Mobility, has serious problems.  Not only is all Motorola‚Äôs Android-based products banned from importing into Germany and selling to Motorola‚Äôs online store because of three patents (yes, <a href="http://www.visitm.de/en/Cell-Phones-and-Tablets-1%3FosCsid%3Dqhk9m41midoiukg6jcqqub74k4">there‚Äôs nothing</a> on the Motorola site in Germany), so Microsoft continues to head off, suing in violation patent <a href="http://worldwide.espacenet.com/publicationDetails/biblio%3FCC%3DEP%26NR%3D0845124%26KC%3D%26locale%3Den_EP%26FT%3DE">EP0845124</a> , describing the work of map services.  As you know, all Motorola smartphones are certified by Google Play, so they include the Google Maps application, which violates the Microsoft patent. <br><br>  But the most curious thing is that it is not even a patent infringement, which is no longer a novelty for Android, but the fact that Microsoft demanded that Google be involved as the second respondent, since it is the developer of the application, and also the full owner of Motorola Mobility and is responsible .  In this way, the ‚Äúglorious‚Äù tradition of pursuing Google partners is interrupted, and the Open Handset Alliance is struck at the heart by the search giant. <br><br>  Yes, Google is not the first time as the second defendant in Android affairs, earlier in the case of Nokia vs.  HTC in the US Google intervened in the case, but on their own.

      Thus, pushing in Germany, Microsoft is forcing Google to accept the terms of the world proposed in <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/148821/">July</a> .  The guys from Mountain View are not in a hurry to negotiate with Redmond, but there is no solution to the patent problem yet, except for the common words of Schmidt and Drummund that competitors are trying to crush Android with better products and patent claims. <br><br><h4>  Google vs.  FTC </h4><br> <a href="http://minus.com/lml92BEd9RwoR"><img src="http://i.minus.com/jml92BEd9RwoR.jpg"></a> <br>  While there is a patent war in Germany, the US Federal Trade Commission (similar to the Russian Federal Anti-Monopoly Service) is conducting an investigation, in which it suspects Google of violating US antitrust laws in the form of abuse of a monopoly on the search engine market to promote its own products. <br><br>  The reason for the investigation were numerous complaints from Yelp, Nextag and several other services that Google specifically manipulated the results of the issue in order to bring their products above the products of these services, forcing them to pay for advertising for the sponsored place in the issue.  Google, represented by Eric Schmidt in the fall of that year, stated in the Senate that no manipulations are carried out, but equal conditions are used for all.  The Senate and Congress believed Eric in the words, but the FTC nonetheless launched an investigation, highlighting the five commissioners, who collected the necessary information and evidence in a year.  According to unnamed sources in the Commission, four commissioners favored the commencement of the prosecution, and one was skeptical of the charges.  So far no official claims have been filed with the search giant, but the head of the FTC, John Leibovitz, believes that the process against Google will begin in late November or early December, when all documents will be ready. <br><br>  According to current practice, Google has two choices: admit violations and enter into an agreement with the Commission.  This will lead to an insignificant fine and an order to present options for correcting violations in a certain period.  The second option is to deny all the accusations, which will lead to one of the loudest processes after a similar process against Microsoft, which almost led to the division of the company.  Of course, the process will be long, and Google will have a chance to win it, but in case of failure, a minor fine will not get off. <br><br>  Appeared "prospects" instantly reflected on the quotes of Google.  Shares <a href="https://www.google.com/finance%3Fclient%3Dob%26q%3DNASDAQ:GOOG">fell by</a> almost 1%, and the company lost $ 2.5 billion in capitalization, having missed the recently <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/153061/">won</a> second place in the list of the most expensive IT companies. <br><br>  According to <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2012/10/13/us-google-ftc-antitrust-idUSBRE89B16G20121013%3FfeedType%3DRSS%26feedName%3DtechnologyNews%26utm_source%3Dfeedburner%26utm_medium%3Dfeed%26utm_campaign%3DFeed%253A%2Breuters%252FtechnologyNews%2B%2528Reuters%2BTechnology%2BNews%2529">Reuters</a> and <a href="http://www.computerworld.com/s/article/9232285/Microsoft_alleges_Google_Motorola_39_s_Android_phones_infringe_its_mapping_patent%3Futm_campaign%3DFeed:%2520computerworld/s/feed/topic/15%2520(Computerworld%2520Mobile%2520and%2520Wireless%2520News)%26utm_medium%3Dfeed%26utm_source%3Dfeedburner%26source%3Drss_mobilewireless">ComputerWorld</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/154673/">https://habr.com/ru/post/154673/</a></p>
