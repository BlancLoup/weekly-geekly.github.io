This time, the culprit of the post did not have to search for a long time - he knocked to me himself: through a telegram.  Which, frankly, is surprising: either we have missed something, or the audacity is breaking records, or this is such a maneuver to divert attention.

      The construction project of an innovative air-conditioner-free air conditioning plant (EWA) is a great way to invest in the environment and generate income!  Sounds good, isn't it? <br><br>  The WP states: today, in the field of cooling systems, EWA cooperates with companies such as: <br><br><ol><li>  Latvian Railways </li><li>  Carrier Vodafone </li><li>  BP Global </li><li>  Power supply company Latvenergo </li></ol><br>  But here‚Äôs the analyst‚Äôs conclusion: ‚Äúif it were so, it‚Äôs logical that on the Internet at least some information was about the company.  But all publications (about) a week ago ... it is also indicated that the product has been developed since 2002.  And its production began in 2015 ". <br><br>  However, all this is standard: for incorrect ICO projects.  The following is more important: namely, the ‚Äúunique principle,‚Äù which bears the proud name of adiabatic indirect-regenerative evaporation. <br><br>  This is where the problem arises, because  We get to the site of none of the four above-mentioned companies, and straight to <a href="http://tessopro.com/">http://tessopro.com/</a> . <br><br>  Let's say more: design, pictures, just blocks of information go straight from the Tesso presentation and at the same time are inserted into the EWA White Book. <br><br>  Let's give free rein to the links: <br><br><ul><li>  Tesso: <a href="http://tessopro.com/docs/TESSO_Prezentatsia.pdf">http://tessopro.com/docs/TESSO_Prezentatsia.pdf</a> </li><li>  And this is WP EWA: <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/16oX1CWf2-wi3Np3Nf5791dZsRvIljlVG/view">https://drive.google.com/file/d/16oX1CWf2-wi3Np3Nf5791dZsRvIljlVG/view</a> </li></ul><br>  The game "find 10 differences" begins? .. And we lose it - those who want to build a new and large market. <br><br>  Is it worth it on Habr√© to talk about the absence of differences in technical catalogs?  Judge for yourself: <br><br><ol><li>  <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/15ck33txjgKHbJJ9-5-GH_-O3AN0ZzRcJ/view">First option</a> </li><li>  <a href="http://tessopro.com/docs/TESSO_Katalog.pdf">And the second</a> </li></ol><br>  So that there is no misunderstanding right away: from the Tesso enterprise card: the general director is Alexander Pinaev (acting on the basis of the Charter).  Of course, there is no question of any CEO Vlada Gorbachev from Ecowaterair, i.e.  projects are different and created by different people.  A little more about them. <br><br>  <b>Team</b> <br><br>  The team is too different nationalities.  Again - I give you on trial: <br><br>  Facebook at the CEO - Vlad Gorbachev was created on November 10, 2017.  Most friends are <b>fake</b> .  On linkedin 8 friends and half empty page.  There are no members of ‚Äútheir team‚Äù in friends in FB, although everyone has FB.  In contact also created November 16.  No friends. <br><br>  The ‚Äúproduction manager‚Äù Janis Kalnins FB was created on October 25, 2017. And here is a comment from my team's correspondence: ‚Äúin general, the dude is not very similar to the production manager :)‚Äù.  See - h <a href="http://ttps//www.facebook.com/janis.kalnins.509511">ttps: //www.facebook.com/janis.kalnins.509511</a> <br><br>  Further: the lawyer Peteris Liepins FB was also created on October 25th.  Lawyer and Janis, of course, have no friends at all.  You can go on a team and further, but it is better to note that, for example, the section "consultants" is simply empty.  A curtain. <br><br>  <b>Code</b> <br><br><blockquote>  What code? :) What are you talking about?;) We're just talking about the blockchain: why else is the code? </blockquote><br>  Blockchain is found in WP only in context: <br><br><blockquote>  We plan to use an offshore company that will allow the register of anonymous shareholders to own shares of solar power plants through a smart contract on the blockchain and receive dividends based on their performance. </blockquote><br>  But why blockchain is needed is a secret.  Not disclosed, incomprehensible, strange. <br><br>  <b>Coin</b> <br><br>  Number of tokens: 200 million <br><br>  Briefly the essence: <br><ul><li>  EWA will allow you to acquire and own the newest air conditioning system worldwide with a discount of 50% of the market value. </li><li>  Investors get voting rights </li><li>  Investors receive dividends (which are not mentioned anywhere) </li></ul><br>  During Pre-Sale, the investor receives a 50% discount (when purchasing from 50 ETH).  Interestingly, there is <b>only 7 days between Pre-ICO and ICO</b> .  And again - a clipping from the internal chat of our team: ‚Äúapparently they are in a great hurry to cut the money :)?‚Äù.  However, this may be other explanations, right? <br><br>  Another tenderloin: <br><br><blockquote>  Security of funds collected.  During the preliminary ICO (first phase) we will use: wallets with a multi-signature to collect funds, the withdrawal of funds from which is possible with at least 2 signatures of the Team members.  Wallets balances will be publicly available. </blockquote><br>  That is, security is provided by two people from the team (which is generally acceptable), but about which nothing is known (which is not acceptable)? <br><br>  Separately, this time I will touch on the topic - the community (activity on social networks, interaction with the community and the reaction of investors). <br><br>  Here we must pay tribute - created all possible channels: Bitcointalk, Twitter, FB, vk, Reddit, Telegrams.  Here we will talk about them below. <br><br>  <b>Bitcointalk</b> <br><br>  On the English branch: one page of discussions.  Several commentators say good idea and want good luck.  In Russian: 2 pages.  Negative comments: ‚Äúlaughed at zero fees, the Russian CEO, and a frank scam‚Äù. <br><br>  <b>Facebook</b> <br><br>  A lot of repost on the recordings and admiring comments (the benefit of fb-bots is inexpensive).  Add nothing more. <br><br>  <b>Telegram</b> <br><br>  There is practically no communication other than the team‚Äôs announcements, but 810 people.  Even the crypto environment envies such a number, and this, by the way, is one of the largest communities in Siberia! <br><br>  <b>Summary of the following:</b> <br><br>  The concept of Ecowaterair is very beautiful and useful for society, but this concept does not belong to them, like the rest of the data on the site and in WP, because all the information is completely copied from the already existing and really strong company - <b>Tesso from Perm</b> . <br><br>  Ecowaterair is an example of a frank and cheeky scam with theft of not only the idea, but also the entire design, technical characteristics and lines of the company Tesso.  But judging by the non-existent members of the team, it is obvious that no one was going to embark on the implementation of the voiced ideas.  Nevertheless, unfortunately, in some social networks or in the comments on bitcointalk people openly wished the project success and were enthusiastic about the concept and innovative idea. <br><br>  PS I must say that the work of our analyst (Irina Malashkevich) did not go unnoticed: a reaction appeared on the oldest Bitcoin forum.  In particular, here is one of the important <a href="https://bitcointalk.org/index.php%3Ftopic%3D2439245.40">comments</a> : <br><br><blockquote>  Flick of the wrist to open the documentation of your competitors and yours.  Your competitors and yours ... Compare design, graphics and other values.  They are identical.  Consequently?  They are copied (even judging by the quality of the photo).  And yes ... You are in such a case not on horseback.  And why removed the link to the technical documentation?  In it, you didn‚Äôt even deign to remove the TESSO inscription on the charts.  If you are so smart, then I will reveal to you a huge secret!  In the search engine cache everything is preserved.  And just with a flick of the wrist I pulled out your technical paper.  Therefore, you carry nonsense in this case </blockquote><br>  Even the drawings are not stuck. <br><br>  For now - everything: I hope the scams won't change this world for the worse.  Forces! </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/343444/">https://habr.com/ru/post/343444/</a></p>
