  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Corporate information: reality and fantasy</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Recently, I have been thinking a lot about data journalism.  Why do companies so lazily adapt the possibilities of interactive infographics to their needs?  Will these excellent information services be so great for employees?  The fantasies on the subject pulled an analysis of reality behind them, so the first half of the text about what informing is and what to do with it. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/8f0/f02/559/8f0f025599084d3c9e508c0cef1aa6d8.jpg" alt="image"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h3>  Configure base </h3><br>  Despite the general progress, in a considerable number of companies the intranet still exists for a tick.  He has no owner involved, because in IT departments (where he usually refers) there are no professionals who professionally work with information and content.  Those philologists, PR managers, translators.  And since the mainstream media is dangling orphaned, we can safely say that the information function in the company is not framed. <br><br>  Agree on terms.  Informing, and I am talking about mass informing, is a timely report to the staff of news information (what, where, when).  Information is an important management tool, because many business processes can be blocked if an employee doesn‚Äôt know and do about something in time.

      Yes, at first glance it seems that everything is clear and simple.  But in fact, while the company is small, important information comes from all corners of the office, and when it is already 300+, the information disappears or its distribution becomes chaotic.  Leaving this topic unattended for some time is possible, but already fraught. <br><br>  <i><b>Example</b></i> <br><blockquote>  When I joined the company, there were about 400 of us, the intranet was represented by two dead portals, HR was responsible for one, the second was technically supported by IT.  The main way in which information was delivered was mailing by corporate mail.  And what were these mailings!  Everything was sent to them: from key data on bonuses to announcements about the loss of keys somewhere there.  Each letter surprised with its html-layout, although the authors tried to copy the template from the previous letter.  Letters were answered and often at once to the whole company.  It is clear that the writing style and grammar were also copyrighted.  There was no news feed. <br><br>  What did the staff have to do in this situation?  Of course, remember about spam, set up mailings in a separate box and never look in there.  Although this was difficult to do, since the letters could come from personal addresses.  As a result, it was difficult to call such an ‚Äúuncleaned‚Äù channel official.  And this is a normal stage of development of the company, the main thing is to pay attention to the function and, here again, to increase the manageability. <br><br>  Then the initiative group gathered and it took us about three quarters to combine the portals, think over the information architecture, fill in the basic content, come up with the business logic of newsletters and implement it on SharePoint, distribute the rights, select content managers in the "fields" of the divisions.  In terms of information, the following was made: <br><br><ol><li>  Access to the newsletter is limited; </li><li>  The newsletter was made only on important and urgent reasons, the rest went to the news and the weekly digest; </li><li>  The moderator is highlighted; </li><li>  The mailing template has become the most "hard"; </li><li>  The authors have been trained. </li></ol><br>  That was in 2013.  Almost five years ago.  During this time, nothing has changed: neither the design of the digest, nor the "marker" for key news, to the newsletter template.  On the one hand, this is a stone in my "maternity" garden.  And on the other hand, what works well doesn‚Äôt always need to be touched.  The channel information is configured.  The generation of employees who remember the old portals has long been blurred by the new 800+.  And the universal Zen rule is very useful here: 30% do not read the news, 30% read from time to time, 30% always read, 10% write news.  Is always.  Regardless of the frequency of redesigns. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/f15/692/f11/f15692f1129b4828adcffae6521cc598.png" alt="image"><br>  <i>This is the main page of the corporate portal ICL Services.</i> <br></blockquote><br><h3>  Information, dialogue, influence </h3><br>  In the concept of "informing" there are two key characteristics.  The first is one-sidedness: they say, we said, and you somehow read it there and think about it.  The second is objectivity: we do not select texts to formulate your opinion this way and that, we are classic news journalism.  That is, we bring information to the masses when the reason for publication is undeniable: an event happens or happens. <br><br>  Recently, however, began to look at informing a little disregard.  They say that it‚Äôs about one-sidedness, monologue, non-strategic character and not at all a matter for communication specialists.  Maybe.  But at the same time, we must not forget that informing, high-quality informing is just what the communicator needs to build in the company first.  And only then dokruchivat tasks and how to solve them. <br><br>  The fact that, if desired, can be done with one-sidedness, is understandable.  These are social network games and functionality: likes dislikes, comments, polls, etc. <br><br>  <i><b>Example</b></i> <blockquote>  We still haven't turned on the news comment feature.  For the most part, because of our perfectionism, since we assume that there will be a significant amount of content with which you need to work thoughtfully.  Although one colleague told me with confidence that no one would respond to each other‚Äôs comments better than the employees themselves.  Perhaps ... But another decision comes to mind.  In the company for many years (longer than a full-fledged portal) there is a collective blog, not related to the official base of employees, which is currently going through difficult times.  And if we do not combine it with the official news feed so as not to create competition for the already familiar resource and numerous external social networks?  Just at the level of posting important news and digest?  You look, and the number of registered participants will increase, and the company will receive a more regular feedback to their information. <br></blockquote><br>  As for influence, there is an acute problem of goal-setting.  While the system is working in the information mode, only tactical tasks that are able to formulate middle management are solved.  If we go to the classical influence, then leadership should be included.  It should assess the situation, taking into account all analytics on staff satisfaction, all visions and own plans for the business - and formulate a goal: why we influence, to whom, for how long. <br><br>  And this is not about propaganda in its modern political "sense", although, of course, any influence is about the interpretation of chaos.  And this is a natural human need and typical social expectations.  The company‚Äôs audience, like any other audience, needs to reduce uncertainty and expects this from the company.  You can generate negative, you can ignore it, and you can explain it.  And ideally, mark the material with a clear marker so that the employee understands where the news is and where it‚Äôs for life. <br><br>  <i><b>Example</b></i> <i><b><br></b></i> <br><blockquote>  The basic tool in the formation of a managed information field is the content plan.  He is well known to marketers and public relations people.  And if internal communications are integrated with external ones, then questions about its use will not arise.  In our case, VCs are part of HR, and here historically other methods and approaches.  Recently, we have begun to plan the placement of materials not only on obvious news events, but also analytics, reports, opinions, stories about people.  Prior to this, similar materials also existed, but, as a rule, in the form of ‚Äúletters to the editor‚Äù or as an answer to something that is already too ‚Äúburning‚Äù.  In order for employees to appreciate their health and LCA, you need to remind them about this quarterly, revealing the topic from different angles.  And not once a year at the time of issuing new policies ... Unfortunately, this branch of development involves a significant increase in the amount of work, the inclusion of a large number of people in the task of generating content, and all this on an ongoing basis.  Can a non-core business afford not only a professional editor, but also a journalist? </blockquote><br><h3>  Data journalism: reader = author </h3><br>  Reflecting on the resource-intensive content plan, I began to read about data journalism.  In 2014, RIA had a wonderful translation of the book <a href="https://ria.ru/files/book/_site/">The Data Journalism Handbook</a> , which describes this content phenomenon vividly and with examples.  And it seemed to me that the use of the data journalism approach may well lie in the tasks of corporate communication. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/4db/f96/fce/4dbf96fce54f4d06be0666bc938eb05c.png" alt="image"></div><br>  Blogging, storytelling, podcasts, streams - this is a story about author's content, that is, the description of phenomena is always through the prism of the author's "I".  Therefore, there will always be additional work by the authors.  In this communication, the traditional set of roles is retained: ‚Äúthe writer is the reader,‚Äù and these are different faces. <br><br>  What does data journalism offer?  In general, she also offers copyright reports and investigations, but after the stage of collecting a large amount of data, analyzing and visualizing it.  But these traditional author superstructures are optional.  By themselves, these visualizations become complete material.  As if informing.  After all, some objective data are published.  But in fact, the classic information does not end there.  Similar content - immediately and dialogue, and interpretation. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/0cb/35b/391/0cb35b3916b84494b67608f6ffd94d1e.gif" alt="image"></div><br>  <i>Such a histogram was presented by William Playfair in 1786 (!), In order to demonstrate quantitative indicators of imports to Scotland.</i> <br><br>  Each reader, looking at this data, becomes the author himself.  That is, he himself comes up with a plot, based on the actual point of view for himself, isolates from the proposed data and connections that are of interest to him.  The deeper the data and the more sophisticated visualization, the reader = the author can create full-fledged materials, which, if desired, can be interviewed and published.  And here is a new version of the "readers' letters" to the editor (content of the content of the content), but optional, because the communication has already happened. <br><br>  Thus we inform the reader, but we inform: a) online;  b) without thematic aggression;  d) engaging in dialogue and interpretation.  Yes, the creation of such services is time consuming.  But this is a project, not a process: having created it once, we give the world content without an expiration date. <br><br>  <i><b>Example</b></i> <i><b><br></b></i> <br><blockquote>  A team of journalists, designers and programmers gathered and decided that this month they collect data on the quality of schools in the city of O, since the residents do not have transparency and are lost in the choice, and the editor receives complaints (social inquiry as a reason).  After that, data on the topic is collected, mapped, reduced, cleaned, supplemented with fresh editorial ‚Äúexcavations‚Äù and eventually published on the editorial site as an interactive service.  The service can be used by anyone: find your school, compare it with schools in the area, see the highest ratings in the city, see the lowest, compare schools on the basis of X, draw correlations on signs X and Y ... Yes, journalists will make their stories here and, more likely, all, embed this content in some adapted form in this visualization.  But each user will also draw his own conclusions, having studied the data that is interesting to him specifically. </blockquote><br>  Well, cool!!! <br><br><h3>  "Big infographics" </h3><br>  And now fantasy on corporate data visualization.  PR people, designers, and programmers are going to do great volume, deep interactive infographics.  What topic?  On all key.  Finance, clients, social, expenses, income.  It is worth asking colleagues what information they lack.  You can look at the sick themes.  For example, if employees do not see the connection of their work with the overall goals of the company, then output the data that will answer this question.  "I brought the company so much money, the company spent so much on me."  With all taxes in both directions, with all investments.  You can embed some exploits by surnames.  You can detail the team, the departments - depends on the culture of the company in relation to personal merit. <br><br>  As a rule, these data are in different forms in companies and serve the tasks of management accounting.  Someone has beautiful features with complex formulas, someone has chaotic, not yet combined notebooks.  And it is clear that before you publish such data, you need to configure their collection.  Well, be prepared for mistakes, inaccuracies and investigations of employees.  And what? .. Auditors less work, optimization from the "bottom", encourage initiatives. <br><br>  And yes, I am now showered with tomatoes, saying that no leader will agree to openly issue such data.  I will not argue with that.  It seems to me that it can.  Any adult understands that one of the tasks of the corporation is shareholders' profit, therefore this information can be perceived quite loyally.  Especially if at the same time the manager offers employees comfortable workplaces, and the employees have a choice.  In addition, the form of dashboards already firmly included in the reporting of any levels.  It is just necessary to strengthen it with interactivity, publicity and multi-level connections that are understandable to a wide audience (!).  After all, the second risk here is the employee himself, who does not want or does not know how to work with information.  Therefore, communication should be about the eternal and vivid, and the audience - loyal to the skill of analysis. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/3a8/dea/4e6/3a8dea4e63d44c90b86f9ccc07dd1c44.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  <i><b>Example</b></i> <br><br><blockquote>  Somehow one young man asked the CEO of a large IT company, and why does the operating director get paid so many times more than he is an ordinary system administrator.  To this, the CEO replied that the system administrator would receive as much immediately after having 800 people under his authority.  So, the answer to the employee can also be visualized so that others do not suffer in silence.  Well, all the other data that the employee and the manager need in order to feel trust, certainty, controllability and connections.  And the employee will be happy to become both a reader, and an author, and an expert 24 hours a day.  Want to see how the euro jump influenced the company?  Look at the chart.  Do you want to know if the company plans to sell in Java development?  See how much she invested in Java lately!  Made an offer from Berlin?  See what payments the company makes for you and compare them with the tax conditions of Germany.  And so on.  Etc. </blockquote><br>  Why all this?  And the fact that informing is great.  Informing with a static fact is a base, affecting the content plan and analytics is powerful, and informing and interpreting with interactive connections is a possible development (not only communication functions, but all of Central Asia).  Even if at first glance this option seems very idealistic.  I would love to undertake such a project.  Well, or would dream with someone else on this topic :) </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/336670/">https://habr.com/ru/post/336670/</a></p>
