  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Build an outdoor WiFi network</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Good day.  I did not find the necessary topic (in all there are only pieces), so I decided to write in a separate post. <br><br>  I am interested in building a ‚Äústreet‚Äù city WiFi network, as GoldenTelecom built it at one time, only they had direct access to the network and their own broadband access.  Since there are enough providers in the market, you can rent or just buy traffic.  Based on this: <br>  - The network will be built on the access to the provider‚Äôs fiber / copper; <br>  - Traffic will be distributed with WiFi modem / s. <br><br>  By ‚Äústreet‚Äù network, I mean connecting equipment (of course, industrial equipment) and distributing traffic directly to the streets (from buildings).

      Questions not yet covered: <br><br>  <b>1) A more detailed scheme for building such a network</b> <br><br>  Theoretically, I imagine it this way: <br>  - Cable (outgoing from provider fiber) - connected house <br>  - Equipment connected to it (routers) <br>  - Purchased traffic <br><br>  But there are nuances associated with the construction of the network: when you enter the house and install such equipment, you need to install switches that close the network.  Is it necessary?  Or is it necessary for a single connection? <br>  Tell me, please, more detailed construction of such a network: the necessary equipment <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  <b>2) Coating</b> <br><br>  Since the equipment is industrial, it will naturally be relied on equipment with a high possibility of coverage, while maintaining the necessary speed for customers (i.e., if covered 3 km, the signal will be dispersed somewhere after 1.5 km) at level 8 MB  Those.  useful coverage will be about 1.5 km at a speed of 8 MB.  The situation is hypothetical, but if you correct me, I will be very grateful. <br>  If we take into account that the equipment will not be higher than on the 1-2 floor, what problems may arise from the technical side?  Signal purity / interruptibility / constant speed? <br>  A ‚Äúcircular‚Äù coating is considered, i.e.  so that the diameter stated on the equipment was at least 1.5 km of the useful spread of the signal, with 3 km of ‚Äúprescribed on paper‚Äù <br><br>  Problems such as ‚Äúequipment theft‚Äù, ‚Äúdamage‚Äù, ‚Äúinstallation‚Äù - these problems are considered separately, the technical side is more important. <br><br>  <b>3) Equipment</b> <br><br>  What equipment should be used to build this network?  As far as I know, in addition to building a standard network, it is necessary to connect amplifiers to it, which can distribute the necessary signal power over a long distance.  What is best for this?  Plates or others? <br>  Accept some Chinese manufacturers, but for now there are a lot of questions than answers. <br><br>  <b>4) Signal penetration</b> <br><br>  As you know, you may be faced with the fact that the signal from WiFi may simply not ‚Äúbreak through‚Äù the walls and because of this its useful part will be lost.  How can you increase the signal so that it does not get lost reflecting from the walls? <br>  It is necessary to put inexpensive equipment that can distribute the Internet on 1 street (approximate length - 1 km). <br>  An important digression: the signal must also pass into the depth of the building at least 20‚Äì30 meters, and not be reflected from walls or windows. <br><br>  <b>5) Legal schemes</b> <br><br>  I read earlier the posts that when distributing a signal, you can face the legitimate side of the issue: distribution of frequencies and so on.  As far as I understand, this applies only to WiFi networks, which are built to catch the signal to the antennas and then transmit them inside the house.  This is another task: how it works when distributing from outside. <br><br>  <b>6) The scheme of programming control modems and traffic</b> <br><br>  I read a post about building 2 types of networks where there are 2 types of network management.  Which of them can be suitable for such needs?  How can modems be programmed so that they automatically redistribute traffic to users and you need 0 control from the provider? <br>  Perhaps there are nuances, please tell. <br><br>  <b>7) Modem programming</b> <br><br>  Is it possible to reprogram the modems so that the first page when going to the Internet is 1 constant, like Beeline?  Is this modem software difficult to implement? <br><br>  <b>8) "Channel width"</b> <br><br>  Distribution requires a certain amount of traffic or channel width.  Modern equipment can provide a channel width of 100 MB.  Based on this, I think you can put 1 modem and amplifiers to it, and this will be enough.  Maybe I'm wrong, tell me. <br><br>  <b>9) Security operations via WiFi</b> <br><br>  Despite the fact that the network will be open to everyone, the construction of a ‚Äúscheme‚Äù of security for operations is being considered (so that people can log in, enter the necessary information to access the Internet, and then enter personal information in the social network or their bank data (card numbers), or just pay for something without fear that their data will be lost or stolen (security level - office network). <br><br>  These are not all questions, but would be happy to hear recommendations or criticisms from professionals. <br><br>  Thank. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/201056/">https://habr.com/ru/post/201056/</a></p>
