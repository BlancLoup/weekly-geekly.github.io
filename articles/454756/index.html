      <b>How to check that interested users will find exactly your company and see the advertisement of your products, and not competitors?</b> <br><br>  <b>1.1.</b>  To get started, you need a list of commercial requests for which people are looking for products from your line of business.  A significant proportion of such requests are repeated from month to month unchanged.  For the formation of a list of phrases, it is better to use the Google keyword scheduler (since it selects synonyms and similar phrases).  Follow the <a href="https://ads.google.com/um/signin%3Fdst%3D%252Fko%252FKeywordPlanner%252FHome%253Fsourceid%253Dawo%26subid%3Dru-ww-et-g-aw-a-tools-awhp!o2">link</a> , if necessary, create an account, click "Find new keywords", enter one or more phrases that customers can search for your products and click "start".  As a result, Google will pick up frequently used phrases when searching. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/8v/t_/xs/8vt_xsjm0zsze_iiiyyn7clarss.jpeg" alt="image"><br><br>  <b>1.2.</b>  Now, checking the ‚Äúlist of commercial inquiries‚Äù in search engines, please note that for different queries the search engines will show the same sites, most of which are industry portals, b2b marketplaces and only 10-30% corporate sites of competitors or your Internet resource. <br><br>  <b>1.3.</b>  In the process of searching, people open several links at once, so it‚Äôs better to open all sites from TOP 10 and check whether information about your business is placed on the opened pages of industry portals, business catalogs?  Pay attention - whether paid advertising of your company is visible on the page with search results and on the open pages of industry portals and catalogs. <br><br>  <b>1.4.</b>  It is important to remember that in addition to commercial inquiries, users who are loyal to you use branded inquiries (trade or legal name of your company, trademark, domain name), according to which the result of issuing can be very surprising.  Be sure to see the search result for such requests. <br><br>  <b>PS</b> The result of the promotion check was carried out for the region specified in the browser settings.  The situation in other regions may differ significantly ... In Yandex, for commercial inquiries, a site can get into the TOP only in the region selected in Webmasters and in regions where the company has an office on the maps. <br><br><h2>  <font color="#185F7C">Part 2. Verifying Yandex Advertising Settings</font> </h2><br>  <b>2.1.</b>  Check whether impressions are disabled on information sites for commercial requests.  We go into the account with advertising <a href="https://direct.yandex.ru/">direct.yandex.ru</a> and click at the bottom of the page "Statistics for all campaigns."  Set up slices, columns, and filters, as in the photo below. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/ma/bx/sp/mabxsp0vh831dq921sc2-mqwwku.jpeg" alt="image"><br><br>  <i><font color="#5e5e5e">The photo below shows the sites where ads are shown in the search (website development of video systems). Only by turning off impressions from photographs, CTR increased by 40%, the average showing position improved, and the click price dropped by 20%.</font></i> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/tj/gl/vv/tjglvvk9et26_oabxhfad1qewla.jpeg" alt="image"><br><br>  <b>2.2.</b>  Now let's look at the transitions for which search phrases we pay to Yandex.  Select the Search Queries tab and click on the yellow Show button, and for visual sorting click on the Impressions column. <br>  <i><font color="#5e5e5e">The photo below - popular queries for which ads are shown in the search, all requests are suitable site.</font></i> <i><font color="#5e5e5e"><br></font></i> <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/pk/e1/ok/pke1oknqjkzsfya6ak_toj9n5cs.jpeg" alt="image"><br><br>  <i><font color="#5e5e5e">The photo below is an example of requests from another site, it is clear that there are requests with a low CTR (either the ad is bad or the request does not match the site).</font></i>  <i><font color="#5e5e5e">By making changes, the percentage of conversions will increase, the cost of advertising will be lower.</font></i> <i><font color="#5e5e5e"><br></font></i> <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/bl/wu/j8/blwuj8encyize1pcazoqn4qj83w.jpeg" alt="image"><br><br>  <b>2.3.</b>  Possible customers, having been once on the site, after a while may forget its address and not know how to return to it.  Other users, for example, without dialing, leave the site with the confidence that the company is not working.  Retargeting is a technology with which Yandex and Google can find users on third-party sites and show your advertising message to it.  These can be people who have viewed several pages, downloaded a price list, looked at contacts, etc.  To check the retargeting, go back to the main page <a href="https://direct.yandex.ru/">direct.yandex.ru</a> , at the bottom of the page click on "Retargeting and audience."  If the page is empty, your company does not yet use this useful advertising tool. <br><br>  <b>PS</b> Briefly about checking the settings of Google Advertising.  To see the requests for which there were impressions in the search, but there were no transitions, unfortunately, it is impossible.  Entangled navigation, the presence of phrase match types do not allow to deal with Google logic in a short time.  Therefore, it is better to check the quality of advertising by comparing the total CTR and conversion values ‚Äã‚Äãwith other sources of referrals to the site. <br><br><h2>  <font color="#185F7C">Part 3. Comparison of costs for attracting customers from different Internet sources.</font> </h2><br>  <b>Baseline:</b> Website of a supplier of turkey meat, a manufacturer of semi-finished products.  Region at a site in Yandex UFD, in Google Russia.  The site has no articles, recipes and other pages that attract information traffic.  Statistics is given for 6 months (the design of the site is almost unchanged, advertising worked). <br>  Own visits to the site, transitions from search robots, website analysis services and other bots distort the real picture of the reports.  Therefore, I disabled such transitions in advance through filters and did not take them into account. <br>  <b>General statistics:</b> different visitors according to Yandex Metric 9909, 3044 visits of robots and bots were also filtered.  Download price list 683 people (6.9% of site visitors).  During the day, the share of new visitors - 78%. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/io/jf/z3/iojfz3xnwekqxy4ibdg7vqnr5p4.jpeg" alt="image"><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/x9/ih/tp/x9ihtpcxtktv3guh3dsypdizkd4.jpeg" alt="Source Conversion"><br><br>  <b>The cost of promotion, advertising their own employees.</b> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/ss/a_/-l/ssa_-lhmtr8oxcs4cc4ix0sfh1i.jpeg" alt="Costs for different traffic channels"><br><br>  <b>The costs of a similar company, but without full-time employees with advertising outsourcing.</b>  In such companies, the costs of employees for the promotion and development of the site are absent.  There are costs for outsourcing - for example, the service of one portal with a paid package of services for placing products with relevant text is 20,000 rubles a month, the other has 25,000 rubles a month.  Setting up and maintaining advertising on Google and Yandex will become more expensive, the cost of email distribution will not change.  The number of conversions significantly reduced due to a decrease in traffic sources.  It will be practically impossible to increase conversions to 115 due to advertising and paid service packages, since traffic from portals and search is limited.  In addition, each additional transition from Google and Yandex advertising becomes more expensive than the previous ones. <br><br><h3>  <font color="#185F7C">3.1.</font>  <font color="#185F7C">Learn more about conditionally free conversion sources.</font> </h3><br>  Conditionally free sources - referrals as a result of website promotion on requests and placing information about the company on free sites.  The costs of attracting new users are determined by the costs of website promotion. <br><br><h4>  The first access to the site from industry portals, marketplaces </h4><br>  For the site in question, the transitions were from more than 150 different domains, 20 main sites constitute more than 80% of all source traffic.  The possibility of traffic growth is limited to 10-20% (information about the company and products has already been posted and is regularly updated on almost all popular free sites). <br><br><h4>  The first access to the site from search engines </h4><br>  The share of conversions from Google is 55%, from Yandex 42%.  There is potential for traffic growth, for example: temporarily changing the region in Yandex from the Urals to Yekaterinburg, while the average position for the 200 most popular phrases instead of 10 became 3, and traffic in the region grew by 40%. <br><br><h4>  The first call direct (hidden transitions from any site, the transition from the file xls, or messenger) </h4><br>  Basically, such visitors type the site address manually in the address bar, or visits to the site from directories and portals that do not pass data to the metric.  There are also transitions from the price list and messenger.  The possibility of growth of such traffic is practically absent. <br><br><h3>  <font color="#185F7C">3.2.</font>  <font color="#185F7C">Read more about paid conversion sources.</font> </h3><br><h4>  The first access to the site from the industry portal (paid placement package) </h4><br>  The average cost of the site in question to attract one new visitor using a paid package of services is 29 rubles.  The possibility of traffic growth from the Urals Federal District is up to 50%, but the cost per visitor will be 40-50 rubles.  A further increase in visitors from paid sites is more expensive than 50 rubles per person.  I did not test such sources due to limitations in the advertising budget. <br><br><h4>  The first entry on the site from advertising Yandex, Google </h4><br>  The cost of attracting one new visitor through Yandex Direct is 15.9 rubles, through Google Advertising 12.2 rubles.  Advertising in Google search was launched only 30% of the time, advertising on search engine partner sites was only in Yandex (YAN).  The increase in advertising costs by almost 2 times will lead to an increase in traffic by 50%.  All the possibilities of expanding advertising in Yandex while maintaining the price of the transition are exhausted.  I also want to add that the costs in the table took into account advertising for the return of those who were on the site (more than 10% of the budget in Yandex, such transitions do not add ‚Äúnew‚Äù visitors). <br><br><h4>  The first entry to the site from the email-list </h4><br>  The cost of attracting one new visitor 9.3 rubles.  On average, we received one mailing per month for more than 3,800 valid email addresses, 20-30% of readings (depending on the season), and 6-10% of links to the site from open letters.  Unsubscribe or send to spam for 7-10 people from the list.  The possibility of increasing the traffic of new visitors through mailings is limited by the growth of the database of email addresses. <br><br>  <b>PS</b> Some new customers have not visited the site before - they contact the sales department from an online catalog where information is posted.  In many ways counting came to the conclusion that their share is 30%.  Over time, they visit the site, for example, after sending price lists to email addresses. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/454756/">https://habr.com/ru/post/454756/</a></p>
