As part of the study ‚ÄúFuture evolution of man‚Äù <br><br>  This forecast was made on the basis of the hypothesis ‚ÄúGeneral theory of evolution‚Äù, which I formulated in 1998 in a report at a scientific conference.  Although more than fifteen years have passed since the report, the conclusions made in it are no less relevant now. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  The proposed hypothesis provides an opportunity to see the contours of a holistic picture of the evolutionary development of nature and can help to see the prospects for the development of human society, which is currently in a deep crisis.  The crisis is caused by the lack of understanding that in higher biological species, including Homo Sapiens, the center of gravity of the process of evolutionary development has shifted to the sphere of mental phenomena.  Moreover, in the evolution of man, the psychic sphere plays such a superior role that other factors, including genetics, make an incomparably smaller contribution. <br><br>  To make a forecast, it is necessary to know what other factors influence the development of crisis phenomena:

    <ol><li>  In the process of settlement and isolated development, different groups of representatives of the same species formed different languages ‚Äã‚Äãand socio-cultural traditions.  This process by Eric Erickson and Konrad Lorenz was called pseudo-speciation, when representatives of one species, because of these differences, consider each other representatives of different species, and as a result, mutual aggression occurs. <br><br></li><li>  Different levels of knowledge, economic, technical and intellectual development of different nations, leads to the exploitation of some peoples by others. <br><br></li><li>  The explosive growth of scientific and technological progress, the speed of which is far ahead of the adaptive capabilities of the human psyche. <br><br></li><li>  The growth of population and the development of transport, leads to the life on the same territory of representatives of different cultures. <br><br></li><li>  Low level of consciousness among representatives of political and economic elites. </li></ol><br>  The lack of consideration of these factors led to an increase in mental tension in relations between states, political and economic elites of different countries.  The critical threshold was reached at the beginning of the twentieth century and during the First World War there was a partial defusion of accumulated tension.  Why partial, but because during the war it was not possible to remove all the accumulated friction between the leading world powers.  Moreover, the revolution that took place in Russia substantially increased the level of tension. <br><br>  As a result, after another quarter of a century, another powerful defusion of accumulated tension, the Second World War, took place.  The events of the first half of the twentieth century, two world wars and the revolution in Russia, which claimed many human lives, served as a painful lesson for the human community.  The awareness and understanding has come that the next global conflict can be avoided, since it is incompatible with the survival of human society, especially when many countries have weapons of mass destruction.  Therefore, the stresses that continue to accumulate find relaxation in local conflicts, which unfortunately also lead to the death of people, only on disproportionately smaller scales.  All events in the world, leading to premature death of people with some exceptions, can be considered as the result of the action of natural selection in the process of psychic evolution. <br><br>  In the period up to 2050, an enormous amount of knowledge in the human sciences will enter a new quality and a theory will be created that can explain the causes of negative processes in human society and show ways to eliminate them.  There will be an awareness of the need and the opportunity to invest material and financial resources, the human intellectual potential not in the production of weapons, but in human development. <br><br>  During this period, efforts will be made to spread the knowledge that the brain of a modern person, with approximately 100 billion neurons and an immeasurable number of synaptic connections, forms in everyone a potentially infinite internal information space, as well as powerful information processing mechanisms that provide every person with significant intellectual and creativity.  In the initial period of a child's life, from birth to about three years, the period of "imprinting" (translated from English as "imprinting"), information is laid in the ancient brain structures responsible for instinctive behavior, I would even say imprinted, as this information persists throughout life in our unconscious, which then becomes the basis of personality and has a huge impact on the whole subsequent life of a person.  The content of this information depends on a variety of factors on the social and natural environment in which the child is being brought up, on the attitude of the parents and next of kin to it, on the composition of the family, on the relationship of the parents between themselves and many others.  In this most important period in the life of a child, attitudes toward themselves and the world around them are formed, sexual identification and sexual preferences are formed, a model of family relationships is developed, a thermoregulation system is set up, and taste preferences are formed.  This information may also include encyclopedic knowledge, as is done at the Glen Doman Institute for Early Development, knowledge of several languages ‚Äã‚Äãand the ability to play several musical instruments, wrote about it in his book Masaru Ibuka ‚ÄúAfter three is already late‚Äù, and can represent themselves information dump with a variety of conflict programs, phobias and fears, which most often occurs in most families in Russia, and not only in Russia, due to the lack of knowledge of parents about the importance of the period of "imprinting". <br><br>  In the period up to 2050, a project will begin and continue in the period up to 2100, which will allow interrupting the endless baton when parental problems received during the ‚Äúimprinting‚Äù period are passed on to the next generation through emotional interaction.  For its implementation, large-scale psychological work with young people will be organized to help them eliminate the negative problems they received in early childhood from their parents and thereby prevent their further transfer to the next generation.  Consciousness, a powerful feedback mechanism, in the process of internal work, difficult and painful, makes it possible to correct or erase conflict programs, change attitudes and eliminate other emotional disorders.  All this is possible only with the availability of relevant knowledge.  The project will be based on work in groups whose leaders will have relevant training and knowledge.  This approach will provide a faster and more reliable result.  In addition, the widespread dissemination of the knowledge necessary for such work, supported by the authority of science, will be organized using the media and the Internet. <br><br>  Already in the period up to 2050, in order to ensure greater security in the world, namely, the cessation of illegal migration, the cessation of uncontrolled population growth and the cessation of local conflicts, practical steps will be taken to redress the imbalance between economically developed countries and third world countries.  To implement them, material and financial resources will be consciously invested in the education system, in social infrastructure, in the development of modern communication systems, industry and efficient agriculture in these countries. <br><br>  In the period up to 2100, all the above activities will lead to an increase in the level of consciousness of the world's population.  For a better understanding, I will try to briefly disclose the meaning of the term "level of consciousness." <br><br>  In the above-mentioned hypothesis, it was suggested that the social connections that emerged in the process of evolution are essentially feedback systems designed to maintain the stability of the brain and, accordingly, the psyche.  The higher the evolutionary scale of the species is, the larger the brain volume and the more complex the structure of social relations must be to maintain mental stability.  It is not difficult to find confirmation of this, for the closest to the human species, the great apes, the most complex structure of social connections, compared to other species, and the structure of social connections in human society is much more complicated than it is.  Approximately a million years ago, and perhaps even earlier, another type of feedback, ‚Äúconsciousness‚Äù, appeared in human ancestors, the appearance of which, in my opinion, provided such a rapid, by evolutionary measures, increase in brain size without losing its stability. <br>  ‚ÄúConsciousness‚Äù, as a new type of feedback, has a fundamental difference from other social types of feedback.  For the formation of social feedback, at least two representatives of the species are necessary; therefore, these types of feedback can be defined as external.  Consciousness, as a type of feedback, is localized in the internal structures of the brain, so it is an internal feedback.  This difference is really fundamental and it will become clear later why. <br><br>  In technology there is such a thing as ‚Äúfeedback depth‚Äù.  The greater the depth of feedback, the greater the stability margin it provides to the system.  So the "level of consciousness" in humans corresponds to the concept of the depth of feedback in the technique.  The higher the level of consciousness in a person, the greater the stability of the brain and psyche it provides.  From the above, it can be concluded that at a certain level of consciousness all external social relations such as production, cultural, friendship or even kinship can be changed or terminated without negative consequences for the human psyche, which is a prerequisite for conscious human rational behavior in most life situations. <br><br>  This conclusion is well confirmed by the fact that with a low level of consciousness during periods of social upheaval and revolution, when existing social ties were torn, the inappropriate behavior of a large number of people led to victims and bloodshed. <br>  In the period up to 2100 will change the principles of family formation.  The family will become an equal union of two, aware of their potential and opportunities, personalities leading a healthy lifestyle and jointly realizing their potential.  A union based on openness, trust and cooperation, Sexual relations and parenting will be a happy addition to such relations.  A child brought up in such a family will grow up to be a mature person, possessing a flexible psyche and easily adapting to changes in the surrounding world. <br><br>  In such families, parents will make an informed decision about how many children to have.  In the future, this will lead to stabilization of the population of the Earth and the change in this number will occur within the limits that do not damage the natural environment. <br><br>  In the period up to 2100, the role of money in the life of the human community will be revised.  Once they appeared as a measure of the costs of material and human resources for the production of goods, that is, they served as a measuring tool and were a convenient intermediary in the exchange of goods.  The situation has changed a long time ago, money itself has become a commodity, moreover it has become a measure and a synonym for power, which, with a low level of consciousness, distorts the psyche of people.  Raising the level of consciousness will make it possible to return the money to their original purpose and, thanks to the widespread use of the Internet and other means of communication, translate it into a virtual form.  With the change in the role of money and the growth of the level of consciousness, cooperation, not competition and rivalry, will become the driving force of society. <br><br>  The growth of the level of consciousness in the period up to 2100 will provide an opportunity for a painless change in the employment structure of people, repurposing or even eliminating industries that produce products that are deliberately harmful or unnecessary for people.  First of all, it will affect the production of weapons, tobacco and alcohol products, drugs and medicines, as well as other products, the need for which will decrease or disappear. <br><br>  All the above factors will contribute, in the period up to 2100, to the beginning of the self-organization of humanity into a single coherently functioning community of people, the main goal of which will be the security of each of its members, as well as the most complete realization of their creative and intellectual potential.  This will be possible thanks to the emergence of the Internet, which will be able to ensure harmonious interaction among members of the community, by analogy with the nervous system of the human body.  In this integration process, there will be a summation of the creative and intellectual potential of a huge number of people, which will undoubtedly lead to an avalanche of scientific knowledge and technological advances.  Predict now what they will be just impossible. <br><br>  The integration process I am writing about is already going through trial and error, with great human suffering and sacrifice.  Understanding and awareness of the laws underlying this process will provide an opportunity to significantly speed up this process and significantly reduce its negative consequences. <br><br>  This process will end, most likely after 2100, and then the person, as a species, will be qualitatively different from the species, called Homo Sapiens, and most likely will receive a new name.  I am sure then the time will come when people will look to the future with confidence. <br><br>  In conclusion, I want to say that in the forecast I emphasized that its implementation largely depends on changes in attitudes towards children and their upbringing.  Now in the world and in Russia we are beginning to understand that the roots of most of the problems of human society lie in the early childhood of a child. <br><br>  PS <br>  If we take the infinity of the information space of the inner world of man.  Then the inner world of man is an analogue of the cosmos.  Even people who grew up in one country, but in different social groups, internal information areas overlap very little.  Therefore, people from different social groups and with different life experiences understand each other so poorly, since there is a very powerful information protection system that prevents changes in the information fields.  The degree of stiffness of the protection system, depends on what period of life information entered.  Information received in earlier periods of a person‚Äôs life is protected more strictly. <br>  What can we say about people who grew up in different countries, and even with different socio-cultural traditions.  Their information spaces not only do not overlap, but are located in different parts of the inner space. <br>  For a man, his inner information space is an ‚Äúobjective‚Äù reality, as he perceives the world around him.  Most people do not even suggest that another person has a different ‚Äúobjective‚Äù reality.  To overcome the distortion of the perception of the surrounding world is possible only through an understanding and awareness of the mechanisms of the human psyche.  This is a very difficult task and they need help. <br>  The purpose of the publication of this article is not only to debate in the comments, but also to find like-minded people who could not only overcome internal distortions, but also help other people to do this. <br>  I am convinced that the forecast is implemented, but it depends on each of us how quickly this will happen. <br>  I can find VKontakte by name and surname. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/397983/">https://habr.com/ru/post/397983/</a></p>
