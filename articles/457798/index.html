And the organization quickly became overgrown with its community.  To date, the OpenStack Foundation <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenStack">has</a> more than 500 members.  Among them are telecoms, cloud providers, hardware manufacturers, and even a domain name registrar.

    <blockquote>  For a long time, the OpenStack Foundation has been developing its project of the same name.  But at the beginning of the year, the foundation <a href="https://www.computerweekly.com/news/252462803/Redefining-OpenStack-in-the-open-infrastructure-era">changed the vector</a> .  The organization <a href="https://openinfradays.pl/en/about-the-openstack-foundation/">began to support</a> projects related to machine learning, CI / CD, peripheral computing and containerization. <br><br>  In this regard, several new projects have joined the fund. </blockquote><br>  <b>What kind of projects.</b>  At the Open Infrastructure Summit conference held in May, OSF representatives <a href="https://www.sdxcentral.com/articles/news/openstack-foundation-pushes-collaboration-with-other-projects-communities/2019/04/">spoke</a> about the first ‚Äúnewbies‚Äù - they <a href="https://www.openstack.org/news/view/426/kata-containers-and-zuul-are-first-pilot-projects-confirmed-as-toplevel-open-infrastructure-projects-by-the-openstack-foundation-board">were</a> <a href="https://github.com/kata-containers/">Kata Containers</a> and <a href="https://zuul-ci.org/docs/zuul/user/gating.html">Zuul</a> . <br><br>  The first project deals with the development of secure virtual machines whose performance is comparable to the performance of Kubernetes and Docker containers.  VMs are loaded at a speed not exceeding 100 ms, so they will be used in the cloud for on-the-fly scanning of computing resources.  By the way, several large IaaS providers are already participating in the development of Kata. <br><br>  The second project, Zuul, is a CI / CD system.  It conducts parallel testing of modifications in the code and prevents potential failures. <br><br>  <b>Fund perspectives.</b>  The OpenStack Foundation says that by changing the direction of development, they will be able to strengthen the community with talented developers.  However, not everyone thinks so - at the May conference, Canonical founder Mark Shuttleworth (Mark Shuttleworth) <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/04/29/canonicals-mark-shuttleworth-on-dueling-open-source-foundations/">called the</a> expansion of the fund‚Äôs portfolio a ‚Äúmistake‚Äù.  In his opinion, the OpenStack Foundation inefficiently uses resources, which ultimately will affect the quality of their main product - the cloud platform OpenStack.  So whether it will be to be seen in the future. <br><br><h2>  What does the Linux Foundation do? </h2><br>  The Foundation promotes and standardizes Linux, as well as the development of the ecosystem of open-source software as a whole.  The fund's portfolio is regularly updated with new projects - some of them appeared literally this week. <br><br>  <b>What kind of projects.</b>  On June 25, the FATE framework <a href="https://www.linuxfoundation.org/press-release/2019/06/the-linux-foundation-will-host-the-federated-ai-enabler-to-responsibly-advance-data-modeling/">became</a> part of the Linux Foundation.  He was transferred to the open source Chinese bank WeBank and the company Tencent.  The goal of the new solution is to <a href="https://devclass.com/2019/06/25/linux-foundation-to-become-home-of-webanks-fate/">help</a> companies develop secure artificial intelligence systems that meet the requirements of GDPR.  It includes tools for the implementation of deep learning methods, <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%259B%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B3%25D0%25B8%25D1%2581%25D1%2582%25D0%25B8%25D1%2587%25D0%25B5%25D1%2581%25D0%25BA%25D0%25B0%25D1%258F_%25D1%2580%25D0%25B5%25D0%25B3%25D1%2580%25D0%25B5%25D1%2581%25D1%2581%25D0%25B8%25D1%258F">logistic regression</a> and ‚Äú <a href="http://cs231n.github.io/transfer-learning/">transfer training</a> ‚Äù (in this case, the already trained model is used, adapted to solve other problems).  The source code for the project <a href="https://github.com/WeBankFinTech/FATE">can be found on GitHub</a> . <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/hk/re/uy/hkreuyd_avpygctrgispvppk6iq.jpeg"><br>  <font color="#A9A9A9"><i>Photo - <a href="https://unsplash.com/photos/QJBsOY6e7QI">Cassidy Mills</a> - Unsplash</i></font> <br><br>  Also at the start of the year, the Linux Foundation <a href="https://www.linuxfoundation.org/press-release/2019/03/linux-foundation-announces-funding-with-github-for-new-communitybridge-platform-for-developers/">announced</a> the CommunityBridge platform.  It acts as a bridge between developers and investors who are ready to sponsor open projects.  The platform should help attract new developers to the open source industry. <br><br>  Despite this, she has already been criticized.  Industry experts <a href="https://sfconservancy.org/blog/2019/mar/13/lf-community-bridge/">point</a> out that the Linux Foundation will provide only minimal financial services, and such issues as contracting and licensing remain ‚Äúoverboard‚Äù.  Perhaps in the future, the functionality of CommunityBridge will be expanded. <br><br>  <b>Fund perspectives.</b>  At the end of last year, the Linux Foundation established two new funds for <a href="https://gql.foundation/">GraphQL</a> and <a href="https://ceph.com/foundation/">Ceph</a> .  The plans of the organization to continue the development of the ecosystem of open-source software. <br><br>  For example, the Linux Foundation and Facebook <a href="https://www.helpnetsecurity.com/2019/06/20/facebook-linux-foundation/">are planning to</a> open a new fund dedicated to the osquery project.  Osquery is an operating system monitoring framework used by social network developers, as well as Airbnb, Netflix, and Uber.  The tool allows you to optimize the process of obtaining data about running processes, loaded kernel modules and network connections. <br><br>  We can expect that in the near future, the Linux Foundation will once again expand its portfolio.  Perhaps they are waiting for the fate of the successful Cloud Native Computing Foundation, from which the Kubernetes and CoreDNS emerged.  Or maybe they will follow in the footsteps of the Tizen Foundation, whose prospects remain unclear because of the <a href="https://www.sammobile.com/2018/12/16/samsung-tizen-smartphones-possibly-discontinued">unpopularity of</a> the operating system of the same name. <br><br>  <i>Both funds - OpenStack Foundation and Linux Foundation - are actively developing their own projects.</i>  <i>We will continue to follow the most interesting of their "acquisitions".</i>  <i>We will tell about some of them in the following materials.</i> <br><br><hr><br>  We at <a href="http://itglobal.com/">ITGLOBAL.COM</a> provide hybrid and private cloud services.  We also help companies develop IT infrastructure.
