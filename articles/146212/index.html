Since we have been working with China for a long time, I agreed without hesitation.  We agreed on the place and time.

      An interesting person about 65 years old came to meet me and introduced himself Sandro Kipiani (Skarzhinsky Alexander Igorevich).  He told me that he was an inventor, and that he was the author of the project called ‚ÄúK28A‚Äù, and that in order to implement his idea, he needed experimental samples of his cycle technology from a new generation, for which he contacted us so that we could find and bring him Bicycle parts from China.  Since August 2002, his company has acted on a volunteer basis, engaged in applied research on the design of an effective force transducer for muscular-drive types of equipment and, in particular, for a bicycle.  The solution was found and patented: RF patent No. 2373101 with priority dated May 17, 2007.  FIPS.ru.  The output torque of the cycle drive is increased several times.  He couldn‚Äôt protect a patent at the international level, he didn‚Äôt have enough money to pay the fee.  He enthusiastically talked about his invention, that he is now engaged in the improvement of the cycle drive and the design of various types of cycle equipment of the new generation;  - new, because for the first time in the history of bicycle building, the main converters of human muscular efforts were reconstructed: the pedal mechanism and the carriage-crank (connecting rod) unit.  Those.  with the same effort on the pedals, the bike moves faster.  The most interesting thing is that in fact you can not buy a new bike but take KIT, i.e.  There is an opportunity to buy the necessary components for the upgrade, after the installation of which, you will ride a bike of a new generation. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/a24/923/e6b/a24923e6bbd9849841ef4155fc7ab21f.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  It was interesting to hear about the tests in Krylatskiy (04/19/08), when the force conversion ratio was exceeded by 104% or 2.04 times as compared to the conversion of the serial analogue ‚ÄúStart-highway B-555‚Äù, whose weight is P = 11.4 kg.  The weight of the same bike with a cycle drive of a new generation P = 17.8 kg.  From here, perhaps, the paradox begins according to the laws of physics, the greater the weight, the slower the speed should be, with the other parameters remaining unchanged.  The test results allegedly refute this physics postulate, since  the weight ratio is 1.56 times and the speed ratio is 1.037 times more than that of the analog, but since this postulate is unshakeable, since  based on the laws of gravity, this means that the transformation of the efforts of the cycle drive has passed into a new structural quality, which is called - "a new generation of muscular-drive types of technology."  From here, in the process of research, a new research area of ‚Äã‚ÄãBioTechnoPhysics was born.  The weight of the cycle drive was so big because it was made ‚Äúon the knee‚Äù - an artisanal method from what was at hand. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/77f/ce9/987/77fce9987ff2b095b75d9d10eddabe35.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/e84/7b7/586/e847b75862564b91c8aeb4116f0afc7d.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/6a4/936/e07/6a4936e0756fd9e9c2e7c1bb2bbcc27f.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  In addition to bicycles, Sandro also talked about all kinds of bicycle mobiles, exercise bikes that can generate electricity up to 10kW of power, and even about flying airplanes ‚Äî amazing devices on wing engines. <br><br><img src="http://atriam.ru/autofly.png" alt="image"><br><br>  In the course of the conversation, Sandro told that he wants to organize a joint venture in Russia with a very famous bicycle manufacturer - Merida (Taiwan).  I immediately said that we would try to contact Merida and tell them about his project.  This is where our first meeting ended. <br><br>  After all that we heard, we were very interested in this idea, and my companion and I began to get involved with Merida.  There was a correspondence by e-mail, in parallel there were telephone conversations.  As a result, Merida said that they all loaded production for the year ahead, and that it makes sense to contact them at least a year later, which did not suit us very much.  On this, we have so far completed negotiations with Merida. <br><br>  In the process of collecting and summarizing information, it became clear that it is not economically feasible to build a new plant in Russia, but it is easier to use ready-made production in China, because there are a large number of small factories that are ready to fulfill this order. <br><br>  Then we remembered that during our last trip to China, we met a Russian engineer who works in a factory that manufactures just a bicycle, a Russian brand, in China.  Without hesitation, we contacted him and began to engage in dialogue.  He gladly told us what and how they work at the factory, about what should be the minimum order and other problems. <br><br>  At the moment, Sandro and I cooperate very closely, he draws up a detailed business plan for potential investors, and we, in turn, are fully involved in negotiations with the Chinese side, discuss plans for placing the first order with the factory, and also actively search for investors.  At the moment there are Russian patents, but to place an order in China, a Chinese patent will definitely be needed, since the Chinese will assign the idea at a glance.  All these patents are naturally not cheap.  And if someone has a desire to support this project, we will only be happy.  So if we invest only our finances, then the development of this project may be delayed.  As Sandro says: ‚ÄúFrom the world - on a string, and to People - the cycle equipment of a new generation‚Äù.  He, for his part, is also trying to attract funding, constantly goes to banks, explains the essence of his project, but since he is no longer young, he is naturally denied. <br><br>  Friends, let's support this project together.  We believe that this one should be implemented, since what we have seen (drawings, design models, etc.) really admires - this is a breakthrough, which once again proves that there are minds in Russia that move progress. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/146212/">https://habr.com/ru/post/146212/</a></p>
