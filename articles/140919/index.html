But why shouldn't he write? <br>  - And let him not write! <br>  ¬© M. Zhvanetsky </blockquote>  This entry is for the very, very beginners who find it very interesting to read here how others could make an accelerator on the oncoming electron-positron beams from two women's magazines, grandfather clocks and blue electrical tape, but they are not ready for this yet.  It seems that hands grow from the right place, but somehow it was impossible to catch the idea, and then realize it.  But I want to start somewhere. <br><br>  Today we will win the microwave (coffee maker, steamer, and so on) - a device that usually beeps for every trifling occasion, although there is no sense from this noise (with rare exception, to which this note is simply not needed).  And let not beeping! <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  Marketers, trying to increase sales of very similar products, have ensured that almost all devices in our apartments are flashing with LEDs.  But it is easy to beat a dark marker or tape.  What to do with useless tweeters?  Make them quiet or turn them off completely!

      So, may we not know anything and do not know how.  Let's still sneak up on our microwave: <br><ul><li>  disconnect it from the network (and do not forget to remove the disk on which everything is usually spinning, so as not to break when turning over), </li><li>  Let us remember that even though the device is disconnected from the network, it can theoretically strike with a current (you never know where the charge remains), therefore we will agree in advance not to touch all insides with your fingers, </li><li>  gently unscrew the screws that hold the lid, </li><li>  removing the cover, examine what is inside. </li></ul><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/f3d/7f3/11e/f3d7f311e5e6d03ecf981b14aa3f7e2b.jpg" align="right" width="400" height="403">  In all this vague jumble it is necessary to find something small, round (a disk, but not a cylinder!), <s>Defenseless</s> and with a membrane.  Yes, this is the desired speaker (photos were taken on a cheese sandwich cooked in the same microwave, which is why it is so muddy, sorry). <br><br>  Then you can do one of the following ways: <br><ul><li>  add resistance to the speaker consistently (people who can do this most likely have not read this line before), </li><li>  make a loud squeak by holding the speaker membrane with something (someone stuffs a piece of cotton there, someone presses with the same blue tape, someone puts some foam around it to drown out the sound), </li><li>  get rid of sounds in general (disconnect one of the speaker pins), </li><li>  assemble the device back <s>, forever forgetting about home comfort</s> . </li></ul><br>  Since for me the two main annoying squeaks are the croaking of alarms in the yard, when motorists close or open their cars (by the way, what's the meaning of these sounds? First of all, I turned off croaking), and the microwave peep (especially if you need to put something then warm up for 7 minutes, for which you have to press the control buttons about ten times, which leads to ten squeaks), then I went the third way - turned off the squeaker. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/2fb/735/dbd/2fb735dbd3cef22c48bb0db828360695.jpg" width="400" height="249" align="right">  Use tweezers to lift one of the contacts going to the speaker (it resisted for a few 5 seconds, after which it came off), put any insulator under it (picture of a piece of paper in the photo), close the device with a lid, gently twist the screws into the old nests.  Everything, now the device works as before, but does not squeak. <br><br>  If suddenly you need to restore this useful function of ‚Äúwaking up a baby who has fallen asleep in the next room‚Äù, then the isolator can always be removed.  It took about ten minutes for everything, seven of which I scrubbed the lid from the greasy kitchen dust. <br><br>  Now you are once again convinced that all these squeaky steamers and coffee makers can be made quiet.  But who else should tear off the speaker?  <b>That's right, home uninterruptible power supply!</b>  In fact, if I'm at home, I will notice a power outage and without his annoying squeak, and if I'm not at home, then why annoy the neighbors, who not only suddenly didn‚Äôt have electricity, but also from somewhere a lousy squeak? <br><br>  If you like this start for the most beginners to start doing something with their hands, then in the next article I will show how to make a ‚Äúphone charger from a laptop‚Äù from a broken phone charger and an unnecessary USB cable. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/140919/">https://habr.com/ru/post/140919/</a></p>
