Well, and besides, everyone will have (or already have) children, who, because of their age and lack of life experience, may not yet understand what they might be threatened with excessive infatuation with modern computer toys.  And by the way, to be able to explain what is wrong here, not everyone can, for example, the older generation, in general, who did not play on a computer (like my parents) are usually limited to the phrases ‚Äúturn off the computer right now‚Äù.  This only works at a specific time and on a specific young organism, and when a gamer is old enough and left to himself, there is no one to control him except himself, and it may take a long time for him to reach the same thoughts that I‚Äôve reached (and maybe he will not come, who knows him).  In any case, when I have my children, I will try to start the process of ‚Äúincome before such thoughts‚Äù in my children as soon as possible.  But for now this is all just a prelude ... <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h6>  Prehistory </h6><br>  When I had a ZX-Spectrum, I played on it.  In everything.  I had a notebook where I wrote down the games in order (I still created the ‚Äúachivka‚Äù for myself, so far I don‚Äôt know why), I got them under 200 pieces at the end of the Spectrum era in my life and the appearance of the Pentium MMX.  Parents then timed this event to enter the institute and did the right thing.  For writing, I also had a notebook, but there were fewer points during college time (I don‚Äôt remember how many), because the games are longer: Duke Nukem, Quake, Diablo 2, the third warcraft, I played all popular, began to play longer in one game and became more picky, i.e.  I was already fed up with everything, and for example, I was never drawn to re-run shooters, unlike warcraft.  People "in the subject", probably, guess what it will be about further. <br><br><h6>  BOB </h6><br>  For the World of Warcraft (I started playing from the European release), I had to ‚Äúhome‚Äù the Internet, before I did not consider it necessary.  At that time, I already stopped being a student and became a graduate student teacher.  Yes, I am so old that as a student I did not download essays from the Internet, but I sat in libraries and rewrote with my hands, and then everything was reprinted.  But something I was distracted, so dependence on Vova was the most powerful, I had the opportunity to participate in the creation of the guild and be a pve-raid leader in the "vanilla", the social component then in the Vove was much stronger and more complicated than now, raids on 40 dug, and this is not ‚Äúhohra-muhra‚Äù for you, you need to recruit and motivate people, and so that it all comes on time and does not scatter for other more successful guilds, we had ‚Äúscandals, intrigues, investigations‚Äù and this social component fascinated by itself not less than the game.  One day, because of the prolonged night raid, I overslept my exam and came to take it three or four hours later, poor students waited in the corridor, I still remember their faces and the phrases "there it goes."  And since I am generally very punctual, but that was, that was, I confess.  In order to somehow prevent me from getting into the ‚Äúreallife‚Äù I don‚Äôt remember, but then I was over 22 and I didn‚Äôt study, so I could afford more time to play.  In addition, I have a computer specialty, i.e.  On the computer there was always something to do besides games.  Well, the departure from the Vova began just with the departure of this social component, our guild collapsed, the game was russified and simplified, my old game friends scattered somewhere, and I practically didn‚Äôt linger in the ‚ÄúMr. of Pandaria‚Äù, and the next addon would do without me.

    <h6>  About Diablo 3, Hearthstone, generally about "blizzy", the results and, in fact, de-motivation </h6><br>  I'm talking only about games from Blizzard, because  I consider them the most ‚Äúdrug addict‚Äù, well, in theory, my reasoning can be extrapolated to any game that creates a similar relationship.  For a start, what is the difference between old and modern games.  Modern - endless (and in particular from Blizzard).  They can not pass and write in a notebook, they say, passed and forgotten.  The most delicious, the so-called endgame content, begins when the main storyline is passed or the maximum level is reached, the story seems to be the end of the game, but no - the retention process is started and it is very sophisticated - searching and knocking out items of legendary and epic (cards in the case of HS), dailies and achivki, giving bonuses and forcing to periodically return to the game, in short, to stop playing at this stage, none of the "hooked up" will not voluntarily want.  The social component (besides the in-game) exists by itself in numerous official and unofficial forums, where thousands of players share their own and others' achievements, vidyushkami and tips on the game, advertising it voluntarily.  There is a plus of games from the browser - it‚Äôs hard to play heavily as if nothing else, and there‚Äôs a minus - it‚Äôs a very long time that it‚Äôs hard to play, and it wouldn‚Äôt be able to play so much else.  Well, then I turn to "you", referring to the gamer-reader and at the same time to myself, because  This article is also a demotivator for me too. <br><br><h6>  Demotivation </h6><br><ol><li>  You are one of millions of players, and you are no different from others, except for the time spent on the game, someone spends more time on it than you, someone less </li><li>  Farm game items for you are hundreds of hours and days of your free (and non-free) time, and for game developers this item is just numbers in the game base and nothing else </li><li>  Developers needed much less time to create a game object than you (and thousands like you) to ‚Äúknock out‚Äù it, everything is governed by the ‚Äúchance of falling out‚Äù parameter that the snaps can turn as they want </li><li>  With the release of the new add-on, your entire (and thousands of other players) farm equipment acquired by hundreds of hours instantly turns into garbage, continuing to play, you will spend your time on knocking out new gear, which then also turns into garbage and so on ad infinitum, but yours no one will ever return the days and nights of time spent on garbage to you, and the blinds draw a new ‚Äúgarbage‚Äù for a year or two and you will pay them for it with money when you buy an addon and time to knock out </li><li>  If you are not infuriated by the previous three points and you do not think that you are bred (like millions of other players like you), then you have not yet matured, this is bad </li><li>  Being the best in a game rating, competing with millions of others, makes sense only for self-affirmation, but why self-affirm in the game if you can assert yourself in real life </li><li>  Are you so stupid that you can't figure out how to spend your time smarter? </li><li>  Are you really so weak willed that you can not force yourself to do more useful things that will be useful to you in life much more than the gaming experience and garbage items, which you yourself will forget in a couple of months (as new ones will appear)? </li><li>  While you play, others learn, work, raise children, spend their time more efficiently than you do. </li><li>  Personal time in your life is the only thing that you can neither buy, nor return, nor lend, and you yourself and voluntarily spend it on "infection for the brain" </li></ol></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/226863/">https://habr.com/ru/post/226863/</a></p>
