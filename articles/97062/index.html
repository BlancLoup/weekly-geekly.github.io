After reviewing a bunch of software, I made a small review where I tried to include the most famous obfuscators. <br><br><h5>  General conclusions and reasoning </h5><br><ul><li>  Free obfuscators are very weak and are suitable only for simple renaming.  Only a few of them know about control flow; </li><li>  There are very good solutions (control flow, MSIL encryption) worth up to $ 500; </li><li>  Adult solutions cost around 5,000, but unfortunately for many of them there are unpackers.  Some of them are cracked. <br>  The obfuscator grunted - it means they understood his defense system.  In the trash obfuscator. </li><li>  There are solutions "against bydlohakerov" - the assembly is fully encrypted and decrypted on the fly.  Hack a symbolic debugger such an assembly easier than ever. </li></ul>

Maybe I just did not find it, because  special effort is not applied.  The code could not be parsed, WinDbg did not find anything either. <br>  Reflector: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/habraeffect/10/41/1041a1e46f4bbbdddee2306a84e6be2c.png" alt=".NET Reactor"><br><br>  Something can be learned with WinDbg, but the IL code of the methods is not given. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/habraeffect/72/f4/72f4ab40f4aae838f4f33520d7b1b224.png" alt=".NET Reactor"><br><br><h5>  {SmartAssembly} </h5><br>  He recently bought the company RedGate.  Honestly, I did not understand the choice of RedGate, {sa} does not even know how to encrypt MSIL.  After sitting with the debugger, you can understand the code.  I do not recommend using this obfuscator, the price of $ 750 is clearly not consistent with the quality. <br>  All that this obfuscator with code does is obfuscate the control flow in approximately this form: <br> <code>L_1 br.s L_4 <br> L_2 br.s L_3 <br> L_3 ret <br> L_4 push <br> L_5 ldc.i4.1 <br> L_6 br.s L_2 <br></code> <br>  Reflector in C # does not parse the code (although it is easy to do it), but in IL it‚Äôs great: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/habraeffect/9d/8f/9d8fd8e6afc539e9d4d4a904830c7075.png" alt="{SmartAssembly}"><br><br><h5>  Salamander.NET </h5><br>  I downloaded a <a href="">super-example</a> from their site.  They promised that Reflector will not open.  Reflector, in fact, cursed, but opened: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/habraeffect/bb/0c/bb0c9b2c248a7f0aa16da5b0cd61c8b1.png" alt="Salamander.NET"><br><br><h5>  Babel (the one that is not free), CodeWall, dotNetProtector </h5><br>  Products of one class, I think, are very suitable if protection of the code from further refactoring and excessive curiosity is required. <br>  Babel: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/habraeffect/44/e4/44e4b595fbe857448e00bba7c0ca8a76.png" alt="Babel"><br>  However, WinDbg successfully showed that inside the assembly made by Babel (probably because I had the community version; unfortunately, I did not check the full version): <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/habraeffect/94/06/9406367d151a9c96c3c7be71247fc296.png" alt="Babel"><br><h5>  C # Source Code Obfuscator </h5><br>  They write on the site that they work with the source code, and this results in a source code that is buggy.  Very interesting approach, but unfortunately, you cannot download the obfuscator itself.  Minus - with this approach it is impossible to encrypt MSIL and incorrect instructions. <br><br><h5>  XHEO CodeVeil </h5><br>  The previous version of this obfuscator had a lot of cracks that appeared very quickly.  That says that hackers know how this obfuscator works.  I did not see the latest version of the crack, but there are bad problems: <br><ul><li>  Applications do not like the antivirus, obfuscator encrypts the assembly and writes to itself (which pleases, the assembly is encrypted in pieces) </li><li>  After this obfuscator, applications should be tested very well, bugs can fall in the most unexpected places. </li></ul><br>  You can use it, but wait for surprises. <br><br><h5>  dotNetProtector </h5><br>  The build turned out to be quite good, but an ambush waited for me - with the build, 4 MB of DLL-ek came from this obfuscator: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/habraeffect/5b/c5/5bc563e0905983c170a9c3df235c3d8c.png" alt="dotNetProtector"><br><h5>  Spices.NET </h5><br>  A very famous product, I was surprised that the resulting applications are so easy to hack: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/habraeffect/ff/e7/ffe721ab3cbfb984d366afbcf496234f.png" alt="Spices.NET"><br><br><h5>  Goliath.NET </h5><br>  The reflector does not open the assembly, it is encrypted.  The jamb is that the assembly is encrypted completely, and it is decrypted after the application starts.  After decrypting no protection in memory: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/habraeffect/4e/99/4e99234e80c9978bb4429f0d3f20246c.png" alt="Goliath windbg"><br><br><h5>  Eazfuscator.Net </h5><br>  Obfuscator free.  It's a shame that only simple rename can do it.  What can please (personally I am more interested in the console or MSBuild versions) is a fairly simple process of obfuscation, it all comes down to dragging the assembly file.  Here‚Äôs what comes out of it. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/habraeffect/fd/8b/fd8b4a28f4f994cedc14501cd6e496f3.png" alt="Eazfuscator.NET"><br><br><h5>  VMWare ThinApp, Xenocode PostBuild </h5><br>  Obfuscators are built according to a similar principle, they can execute code by embedding precompiled .NET assemblies into the application, which eliminates the possibility of intercepting JIT compilation calls. <br>  The resulting applications can run even without installed .NET on the machine.  The size of the resulting application is 10..50 MB, depending on which libraries you will use. <br>  These solutions are very expensive.  But, unfortunately, there are quacks at PostBuild (even the last one).  Probably, in famous circles there are ready unpackers. <br><br><h4>  What do you choose,% username%? </h4><br>  An unequivocal answer to this question is not to give, it all depends on what you value in the code: <br><ol><li>  <strong>All the code in the aggregate</strong> - not one ‚Äúkeychain‚Äù in the code is important, but the code completely.  Encrypt the code with some simple obfuscator, it is better to encrypt MSIL.  If all the code is really important, deciphering it completely will be harder to write again, and no one will do it; </li><li>  <strong>Separate "fishechka"</strong> - for example, checking the key.  I would advise not to give such code at all in public, it is better to cut the functionality in the trial version.  In the full version, the key must be checked, but the risk of theft is less.  Nevertheless, I would advise using a more obfuscator. </li></ol><br><br><h4>  What do I use? </h4><br>  None of the above.  I use my own obfuscator.  This is assembly-specific encryption of the assembly bit by bit, like the .NET Reactor. <br>  The cost of creating it cost about $ 3000- $ 5000.  Yes, it is no better than the existing ones, but there is one thing but - the principle of obfuscation is not publicly announced, it‚Äôs impossible to feel it.  To hack it, you just need to spend more time. <br>  As they say, think for yourself, decide for yourself ... </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/97062/">https://habr.com/ru/post/97062/</a></p>
