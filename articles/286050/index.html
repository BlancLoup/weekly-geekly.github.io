  <section class="page js-page"><h1>How to make money using social networks</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Nowadays, social networks are booming and offering new ways to make a profit. <br><br>  Ten years ago, the word ‚Äúsocial‚Äù meant staying in a pub at the weekend.  Fast forward to 2014, when ‚Äúsocial‚Äù became something of a buzzword, describing how we interact with each other online through various networks.  Today, about half of all adults in the UK use social networks, making us the second most prolific social media user in Europe, according to the latest figures from the Office for National Statistics. <br><br>  But this is a global trend: according to eMarketer, every seventh worldwide regularly uses social networks.  But instead of spending time posting photos and games, social networks can also be profitable - you just need to know how to use them. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  There are all sorts of social media ‚Äî from social networks like Facebook and LinkedIn and microblogging like Twitter and Tumblr to photo-sharing sites like Instagram and Flickr ‚Äî they all have direct access to a huge circle of people, groups and companies.

      If you can successfully advertise yourself, then it will be easy for you to find a job using social networks.  LinkedIn is a good example of a social network for business that helps job seekers to find a job, but other networks, such as Facebook and Twitter, can also link employers and employees.  However, there are many other ways to help make money. <br><br>  First of all, social networks can be a great place to advertise your services and can help you sell something from old clothes. <br><br>  If you have a special skill, you can use social networks to make a profit.  For example, talented photographers can upload their images to the Flickr photo-sharing site and earn money using them.  In addition, skilled videographers can sell their clips on YouTube, and if they are successful, they can make a profit from them. <br><br><h4>  Make Money on Twitter </h4><br>  If you are a regular user of sites such as Twitter and Facebook, then you can earn money by posting advertisements about some companies.  There is a Sponsoredtweets.com platform that you can use to make money by responding to your readers on Twitter.  Facebook also allows you to do this.  In addition, users can post reviews on sites such as Dooyoo.co.uk and make money when people read them. <br><br>  Another way to get money is to display ads on your Facebook page or blog page.  You can show ads from major brands, and you will earn money from the number of clicks on your ads. <br><br>  To do this, you need to register as an affiliate for marketing programs. <br><br>  You can also show ads through Adsense, which will adapt the ads according to the interests of visitors.  However, how much money you earn depends on how many visitors your blog has. <br><br>  For example, if you have 1000 visitors per day, and 1% of them follow the link in the ad, then you could earn ¬£ 10 per day - assuming that the ‚Äúcost per click‚Äù is ¬£ 1, although this can vary greatly. <br><br>  There is another option for bloggers and Facebook users.  Instead of advertising for a brand, some users may write positive opinions about the product. <br><br>  People are social in nature, which means that people become ‚Äúcreative‚Äù from ways to generate income from social networks. <br><br><h4>  Expanding market </h4><br>  As the number of users in social networks increases, the market expands with new services.  Shopa.com, under the slogan ‚Äúshop, share and earn,‚Äù launched in October 2013 and works, recommending products to friends via social networks. <br><br>  Services like Shopa thrive on the web and gather social media users, which means they can use an incredibly wide network to advertise. <br><br>  Some companies rely on social networks throughout their work.  The social trading company Etoro, which has three million users worldwide, allows users to observe the trading activities of other users and copy it.  You can earn a lot of money by copying other people's transactions, but it is important to understand the risks and get financial advice before starting a business. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/286050/">https://habr.com/ru/post/286050/</a></p>
