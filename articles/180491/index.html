      No permanent internet connection is needed, it is quite logical.  In general, the presentation clearly hinted that the Xbox wants to become an entertainment center for the whole family, and not just a game console - all sorts of TV chips, voice control that works well, gestures, and so on. <br>  However, you can familiarize yourself with the characteristics of the console in the near future on each mossy website about games or technology, I want to draw your attention to one interesting, I think, moment.  These characteristics above do not remind you anything?  Well, for example Sony PlayStation 4?  It seems that the filling of both consoles will be almost the same.  The same processor, the same amount of RAM, x86, and there and there, and so on.  I don‚Äôt know if they agreed with each other about it or it just happened, but fact is a fact.  It is not important. <br><br>  In this situation, I really liked the company AMD / ATI, which was able to sell two competitors, in fact, one and the same bicycle, thus making a certain reserve for itself for the future and ensuring the safety of its business for the next few years, because, as you know, Intel's PC processor market is more than confident.  Well, AMD, my congratulations, a great move.  Especially because inside these consoles and graphics will also be from AMD / ATI.  As far as I figured out, there inside will be something like a system on a chip, a sort of hybrid processor.  Honestly, I don‚Äôt understand how it happened that neither Nvidia nor Intel at all participated in the battle for the console of a new generation. <br><br>  UPD.  I figured it outright: for 2013, more than 77 million were sold.  Xbox 360 consoles, even if AMD receives $ 130 from one console, it is more than $ 1.2 billion.  annually for the next 8 years (Xbox 360 life cycle).  At the same time, AMD's revenue for 2012 amounted to $ 5.42 billion, i.e.  1/5 of the amount will provide only one prefix.  And if you consider that the Playstation 3 sold in the same amount, then this amount is doubled.  And this I took a relatively small amount.  In fact, most likely, this chip will cost more than $ 130.  So I wonder why Nvidia with their annual income of $ 4 billion.  sat and clapped her ears? <br><br>  UPD 2. I think I was completely convinced by some comments about the amount that AMD is supposed to receive from each Microsoft and Sony console sold.  Perhaps this amount will actually be less than my guess, we will see it in the very near future.  However, this is still a very significant amount.  I will update the post as any relevant information becomes available. <br><br>  UPD 3. Still, I was not so far from the amount that AMD receives.  Very respected guys from <a href="http://allthingsd.com/20131126/microsofts-xbox-one-cost-90-more-to-build-than-sonys-ps4-teardown-shows/">AllThingsD considered</a> that Microsoft is paying about $ 110 for the heart of its new system, while Sony is about $ 100, RAM adds 60 more, and Sony has $ 88.  In general, the standard package costs $ 471 for Microsoft, Sony costs $ 381, but the Kinect sensor is already included in the Xbox ONE package. <br><br>  Dear habrasoobschestvo, what do you think about this? </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/180491/">https://habr.com/ru/post/180491/</a></p>
