Today we will try again to solve the difficult question of the target audience of the gadget on the example of the compact mirrorless <b>Nikon 1 S2</b> . <br><br> <a href="http://geektimes.ru/company/ulmart/blog/247626/"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/9e7/f89/145/9e7f8914559b4163b5ad66ed74e825da.jpg"></a> <br><br>  We are on the test - the second generation Nikon'ovskoy supercompact camera.  The first in the press did not particularly complain, and on the market it did not get much success, the manufacturer learned the right conclusions from this fact and tried to improve the model in all characteristics.  It turned out to do better?  Definitely!  Here just for the camera turned out this time? <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Each task has its own tools that perform this very task in the best way.  It makes no sense to transport farm products to Ferrari or shoot ducks from a 30-mm air cannon, just as it does not make sense to ride a Formula 1 track on any Lada Largus or shoot a gun at an airplane.

    <h2>  <font color="#e40136">About mirrorless</font> </h2><br>  How did the mirrorless appear?  Someone scratched his turnip and said: ‚Äú <i>Let's take the guts from the DSLR, throw out the mirror, put the autofocus from the soap box <sup>1</sup> and pack everything into a compact case!</i>  ".  On the one hand - a sensible idea.  And it removes well, and does not take up much space, and the optics are replaced, in which case.  On the other - a compromise in this design appeared a great many.  And the body is not very comfortable to hold in hand, and the controls are not the most understandable, and in general. <br><blockquote>  1 - of course, then screwed up the normal autofocus with phase sensors directly on the matrix, but initially the idea was just that. <br></blockquote><br>  Over time, the mirrorless ones found their niche.  Someone took them to understand whether he wanted to get carried away with photography seriously, or not: advanced settings are available, and different lenses, and at the same time, if it ‚Äúdoes not go‚Äù - in ‚Äúgreen mode‚Äù you can shoot without problems .  Others took as a replacement for the ‚Äúbig‚Äù camera, which is too lazy to carry with them.  A person who knows how to take pictures (and not the owner of the camera) will also take a good matchstick with a piece of film inside.  Here mirrorless captivated the public with ease and compactness, coupled with the normal quality of shooting and a relatively large matrix. <br><br>  The Nikon 1 S2 belongs to the ‚Äúsecond generation‚Äù of mirrorless cameras: it is the fruit of love between mirrorless and supercompact / soapboxes.  The matrix has become smaller, like the camera itself, the controls are even simpler, all the excess has gone: neither a removable flash, nor screens with a turning mechanism.  From the "older" models got a relatively serious interchangeable optics, a powerful signal processor and a processor responsible for the post-processing of the signal, the work of the autofocus and other camera charms.  From the ‚Äúyounger‚Äù models - simplicity of control, (if you can put it that way - single-sidedness: pressed the button - got quite a decent result), an attractive price (for a kit with a basic lens 11-27.5 - about <a href="http://www.ulmart.ru/search%3Fstring%3D%25D1%2586%25D0%25B8%25D1%2584%25D1%2580%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B2%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B9%2B%25D1%2584%25D0%25BE%25D1%2582%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BF%25D0%25BF%25D0%25B0%25D1%2580%25D0%25B0%25D1%2582%2BNikon%2B1%2BS2%2BKit%26rootCategory%3D90439%26sort%3D6%26category%3D90055">17,000</a> rubles in Yulmart) and amazing lightness. <br><br><h2>  <font color="#e40136">Nikon 1 S2</font> </h2><br>  Before considering the test frames and analyzing the camera capabilities, I want to quickly run through its characteristics, strengths and weaknesses, determine the audience for this product, and already in the light of the requirements of Central Asia, consider the capabilities of the little ones. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/e7a/acb/9e4/e7aacb9e43ff4c718c3fa98525a69e67.jpg"><br><br>  So it will be more honest both in relation to the camera, and in relation to the reader: otherwise you will get enough of the beautiful pictures, and then you will be disappointed in the performance characteristics. <br><br>  The most interesting characteristics of the camera for discussion are: <br><br>  <b>CMOS matrix</b> <br><ul><li>  Crop factor: 2.7 <br></li><li>  Physical dimensions: 13.1x8.8 mm <br></li><li>  Effective resolution: 14.2 MPix; <br></li><li>  ISO sensitivity: from 200 to 12,800 in increments of 1 EV; <br></li></ul><br>  <b>Gate</b> <br><ul><li>  Type: electronic <br></li><li>  Minimum shutter speed: 1/16, 000 s; <br></li><li>  Maximum shutter speed: 30 sec .; <br></li><li>  X-sync (minimum shutter speed for flash photography) - 1/60 s; <br></li></ul><br>  <b>Autofocus</b> <br><ul><li>  Type: Hybrid, by phase sensors and picture contrast; <br></li><li>  Phase sensors: 73; <br></li><li>  Contrast assessment points: 135; <br></li></ul><br>  <b>Standard lens</b> <br><ul><li>  Bayonet: Nikon 1; <br></li><li>  model: NIKKOR 11-27.5 mm; <br></li><li>  aperture: f / 3.5-5.6; <br></li><li> optical zoom: x2.5; <br></li><li>  stabilization: not available; <br></li><li>  thread diameter under the filter: 40.5 mm; <br></li></ul><br>  <b>CPU</b> <br><ul><li>  Model: EXPEED 4A; <br></li><li>  Video recording: Full HD, up to 60 FPS; <br></li><li>  Shooting full-size photos while recording video; <br></li><li>  High-speed shooting: 400 or 1200 frames per second with lower resolution. </li></ul><br><br>  In addition, in fact, the "iron" features the camera itself is equipped with a very pleasant and powerful software, which, in my opinion, does all the magic.  And this is not about the user interface (he, traditionally, Nikon's is very, very weak, both in terms of convenience and visibility), namely, the camera's capabilities in terms of shooting. <br><br>  First of all, I just want to mention just outstanding autofocus.  From such, forgive, little ones, you don‚Äôt expect instant and precise focusing on those objects that are of interest in the field of shooting.  The camera confidently clings to passing cars, people's faces, bright objects in the foreground and out of 100+ test frames in half an hour I received only 3 or 4 autofocus misses. <br><br>  The second most pleasant feature, for which I must say thank you to the new processor, and the camera's software is the ‚Äúfake‚Äù ISO 12 800. No, the camera also has a ‚Äúreal‚Äù one, but you only need it to shoot blacks playing basketball at night in the black room.  For a static picture, however, it is necessary to apply ISO 12 800 NR (noise reduciton), which forces the camera to take several frames in a row, automatically find the reference points, reduce several pictures into one and compensate for the noise.  To shoot at night, the city, of course, is better on a fullframe DSLR, but among all small-caliber cameras, this ‚Äúlighter‚Äù produces just amazing results. <br><br>  The third feature that I noticed and just can not help but mention: the possibility of absolutely silent operation.  In the settings, you simply turn off the shutter / autofocus confirmation sound, and the camera turns into a silent spy satellite: no one turns around on a nasty squeak or the clearly synthetic sound of the shutter activated when you receive a photo.  Autofocus does not crunch and does not hiss with a motor, the lenses do not drive, in general - a spy's dream. <br><br><h2>  <font color="#e40136">Emptiness</font> </h2><br>  The camera does not have the following <s>useless</s> features: wireless services (with Wi-Fi or Bluetooth connection), touchscreen or rotary screen, connector for external accessories (the same hot shoe for flash).  In the camera, you also will not find any advanced settings, at least for quick access.  In terms of equipment and controls, it is closer to inexpensive digital flasks than to mirrorless ones. <br><br><h2>  <font color="#e40136">The discomfort</font> </h2><br>  The lion's part of the inconvenience in communicating with the camera is delivered by three things: tricky interface, scarcity of controls and an absolutely indecent battery. <br><br>  With the interface, everything is more or less clear: the Nikons have always had their own vision of ‚Äúconvenient‚Äù display of information, but here the company has surpassed itself.  There are no complaints about the ‚Äúgreen mode‚Äù.  To the settings menu - too.  Well, yes, a mess, and sometimes not intuitive, but in general, familiar letters add up to clear words, and it‚Äôs easy to understand what lies behind one parameter or another. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/988/b66/2ef/988b662ef6a34a4787876e96827106f0.jpg"><br><br>  The main complaint is the choice of shooting mode and switching between modes.  Well, if you decide to imagine a true photographer, manually controlling the shutter speed, aperture and ISO, then the trouble begins ... and it multiplies with the second misfortune: the scarcity of controls. <br><br>  At your disposal are: 4-position D-pad, combined with the ring, the OK button and ... everything!  The rest of the buttons are purely functional: viewing and deleting photos, the main menu, the power button and the two-way autofocus / shutter button.  And it would be okay to have a normal D-pad ... but it is small, completely uninformative, and the ring in most modes is simply useless. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/c8d/e92/2f7/c8de922f74e54aeea200fb1add726a22.jpg"><br><br>  For example, in the "creative" mode (in which all kinds of shutter speeds are available) it switches ... program filters.  Slightly redder, slightly greener, sepia figepia, well, you understand.  Built instagramm, only a moderate force impact. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/cc6/7f9/c0a/cc67f9c0aba6473c941f436f9b8754f3.jpg"><br><br>  Well, the third minus of this camera - a small battery - simply kills the whole desire to use it as a substitute for a heavy SLR.  First, the battery can not be charged from the USB-wire.  Only defuse.  Secondly, the charger takes up more space than the camera itself, besides once having assembled a ‚Äúplug‚Äù and a ‚Äúdocking station‚Äù, they will not be able to separate. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/302/e32/747/302e32747ab3429ba67ef7f55c752cbb.jpg"><br><br>  Well, at least I did not dare: plastic looks cheap and threatens to break from the effort. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/d4b/7a2/2ac/d4b7a22ac28d479684d1db8ef24afc10.jpg"><br><br><h2>  <font color="#e40136">For whom?</font> </h2><br>  Summarizing all the above, I would like to take stock and determine who would still like such a camera? <br><br>  I would not recommend it to beginners who want to delve into the photo, explore the possibilities of cameras and deal with exposures and apertures.  The camera is simply inconvenient for learning: all settings are buried far away, are reluctant to be edited, the camera is not very well in the hand.  It will be inconvenient to experiment, you will lose a lot of time fighting the interface and the frames will ‚Äúleave‚Äù you. <br><br>  For those who already have a monster like the 7D Mk2, 6D, D7000 or any other amateur and higher class camera, the camera as a ‚Äúcompact satellite‚Äù will not work for about the same reasons.  Yes, you will make good frames on it in terms of composition.  But as soon as you need something more from it than the ‚Äúgreen mode‚Äù ... Well, you understood, the paragraph above was read. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/dd0/5a8/471/dd05a84718504bcc9ad082524424a773.jpg"><br><br>  There are two categories of users: just the owners of cameras, who wanted ‚Äúgood photos‚Äù and a special group, which I would call ‚Äúrelatives of photographers‚Äù.  With the first, everything is more or less clear, people change their old soap box for something better, they hardly read the reviews and will shoot JPEGs in ‚Äúgreen mode‚Äù.  But as for the "relatives of photographers" - here the camera hit the nail on the head. <br><br>  First of all, you can be sure that in the ‚Äúgreen mode‚Äù your mom-dad, grandmother-grandfather or brother and sister pick up sharp and high-quality shots.  Secondly, you can set the NEF mode (Nikon's RAW-format) and subsequently tighten the frames received on vacation / on vacation / in the country.  Thirdly, the camera fits perfectly both in the segment of relatively inexpensive devices, and in the segment of good cameras.  Well, as a bonus: if you don‚Äôt have your personal monster at your fingertips, you can take a ‚Äúhomemade‚Äù fotik and (swearing and overcoming the flour from the crooked menu) get great shots, drag on the RAWs and print good photos from this baby. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/dea/88e/bdf/dea88ebdf51349c3913a3395c42394ab.jpg"><br><br>  I would define the Nikon 1 S2 precisely in the category of cameras, which in 90% of cases will be shot in the "green" mode, and in the other 10 - those who understand photography.  That is, as a duty "home" camera: for parents, children, shoot what is removed without problems, with one button and practically does not require post-processing.  At the same time, the camera and the frames received with its help do not exclude the possibility of competent finalization of the image. <br><br><h2>  <font color="#e40136">Frames!</font> </h2><br>  For the most typical conditions, I took a camera, went out to the city, and just took everything that got into the lens, without any specific purpose.  Some tourist "and what I do not remember, then pofotkayu."  All shots were taken in NEF format and were converted to JPEG without any correction.  Here's what happened: <br><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Hidden text</b> <div class="spoiler_text"> <a href="http://armarium.org/image/t0J"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/0e5/b0f/cc2/0e5b0fcc27cf1402ab78225098788ab5.jpg"></a> <a href="http://armarium.org/image/t0b"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/581/701/ec2/581701ec2fcc147698bb6b304a791856.jpg"></a> <a href="http://armarium.org/image/t08"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/322/e38/db3/322e38db36a1dd277f8766d11ab0d71d.jpg"></a> <br><br> <a href="http://armarium.org/image/t0m"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/6d5/11a/a8a/6d511aa8a23c70ce3731d2e13e617741.jpg"></a> <a href="http://armarium.org/image/t0Q"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/c8e/287/0d2/c8e2870d2a74f48d2a283167431da9af.jpg"></a> <a href="http://armarium.org/image/t0V"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/e40/a8f/2d0/e40a8f2d086e0896b540bf228b605b6b.jpg"></a> <br><br> <a href="http://armarium.org/image/t0d"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/314/99b/dea/31499bdeae7cf4fae3f0ef85412e541d.jpg"></a> <a href="http://armarium.org/image/t0l"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/36c/2c4/dc9/36c2c4dc9e4613f89929df2d0e72a671.jpg"></a> <a href="http://armarium.org/image/t0z"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/b1e/5bb/7e8/b1e5bb7e8c18c60a48dc85ade7aa5554.jpg"></a> <br><br> <a href="http://armarium.org/image/t0h"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/b60/a29/410/b60a29410f89c5ad898d9be22a632753.jpg"></a> <a href="http://armarium.org/image/t0r"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/3c8/e9b/b01/3c8e9bb0117163e6035ccbdffa9027ed.jpg"></a> <a href="http://armarium.org/image/t09"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/a8e/8b9/c7d/a8e8b9c7d93424f3efbe5d9776daef4b.jpg"></a> <br><br> <a href="http://armarium.org/image/t0F"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/b7a/e54/99d/b7ae5499d69c3e23abe5d0459f2737d8.jpg"></a> <a href="http://armarium.org/image/t0n"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/421/dd8/1b5/421dd81b592c9f44e86ab1601bf63a0a.jpg"></a> <a href="http://armarium.org/image/t0q"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/0d3/7d8/169/0d37d8169f89a31e5730398aac9e7656.jpg"></a> <br><br> <a href="http://armarium.org/image/t06"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/2de/a7a/559/2dea7a559831054cb23fe63091391ab9.jpg"></a> <a href="http://armarium.org/image/t0e"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/8d4/b6b/116/8d4b6b116cea52dd6214c377aaa28a98.jpg"></a> <br><br>  As you can see, the photos are more than "ordinary" and almost all turned out well.  Yes, somewhere, objects are slightly overexposed, in some places there are strong distortions from the lens, but, firstly, everything was filmed in the ‚Äúgreen mode‚Äù, and secondly, NEFs are easily corrected. </div></div><br>  You can download the originals (NEF) in one archive <a href="https://mega.co.nz/">right here</a> .  File size - 491.5 MB. <br><br>  Consider the most interesting and difficult areas in which the automatic mode could have difficulties: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/cfb/2c3/c82/cfb2c3c828924198bc15ff0d28fe455d.jpg"><br><br>  Difficult conditions for shooting: a bright light source, a shadow, usually sensors of cameras in such conditions have problems with exposure metering and white balance.  Everyone remembers the scandalous <a href="http://geektimes.ru/post/246508/">dress</a> ?  Glitches with color perception of the dress watchers arose precisely because of the difficult shooting conditions, the wrong white balance and the different monitor settings and viewing conditions of the audience. <br><br>  Look carefully at the photo.  Even despite the common "blue", the camera is well conveyed as the shade of the temple itself, and the dark dome.  I remind you that the shooting was done automatically. <br><br>  The frame, in my opinion, is somewhat reconnected, but the Nikon 1 S2 supports the NEF format and the resulting photo is easily edited. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/a7e/f44/150/a7ef44150a604393b487c9d851a71288.jpg"><br><br>  The frame was deep and expressive.  I cut out the central part with the most contrasting part: a part of the gray house is facing the sun almost under a right angle, the second is in the shade, and besides there is a contrasting object (a red brick house), because of which the camera could ‚Äúmiss‚Äù the exposure and peresvet important areas of the frame.  There is indeed some ‚Äúoverexposure‚Äù, but it is easily removable, besides, the overall picture turned out to be quite lively and with pleasant colors. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/b32/22b/aba/b3222baba2324e8b9a933fedf142eecd.jpg"><br><br>  Very difficult conditions for the camera: shooting a bright object with contrasting elements from the shadow.  Of course, the meter was wrong, but the frame turned out to be quite detailed, and the near-term plan did not fall into blackness.  You can get a normal result in this case only by shooting in the NEF-format with underexposure or through bracketing followed by pasting frames into the HDR image. <br><br>  By the way, this image has the same problems and the same solutions: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/c5e/2a5/7e2/c5e2a57e2a024e10af36eaaabc44e928.jpg"><br><br>  And now the most unpleasant thing you can get from the auto mode in Nikon 1 S2: when shooting against the light, you get these ‚Äúspecial effects‚Äù. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/b18/2fc/268/b182fc2686f54f00babc50a145d58fbc.jpg"><br><br>  This is the sun glare on the anti-reflective lens coating.  The absence of a blend and a small matrix give such unpleasant artifacts. <br><br><h2>  <font color="#e40136">Pull-pull</font> </h2><br>  The camera can shoot in RAW-format, so not the most successful shots stretch well in many ways.  I carried out the basic processing of photos, corrected the colors, pulled up some settings, and chose two frames in which one of the detailed objects was clearly underexposed, and the other - on the contrary, overexposed.  That's what came out of it. <br><br>  Originals processed photos <a href="">1</a> , <a href="">2</a> , <a href="">3</a> , <a href="">4</a> . <br><br>  The resolution and detailing of photos can hardly be called insufficient, especially considering the small matrix of the camera.  In the approximation clearly visible multi-colored tiles on the temple. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/f86/7f8/2dc/f867f82dcdf54e26b3d8d248433d807c.jpg"><br><br>  The stock on the "extrusion" of parts from the dark areas of the frame is not bad: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/7c6/16b/910/7c616b910af94d709272178cd0cac1b6.jpg"><br><br>  But if you bring the picture very close, of course, we will see indecency in the form of noise: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/eb7/f83/bfe/eb7f83bfeaa048a7949ee0591f88ed55.jpg"><br><br>  On the other hand, even a medium-sized picture is no longer ‚Äúnoisy‚Äù and is quite suitable both for uploading to social networks, to the desktop or as a postcard, and for printing, if you want to. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/e6b/78b/5b7/e6b78b5b7fe647f9a2bd27f651849880.jpg"><br><br>  By bringing a photograph closer, you can see that the matrix does not ‚Äúzamylivaet‚Äù contrasting objects of small size, but leaves them clear. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/d2a/897/58f/d2a89758ff844a5e9b183455dd4d2d52.jpg"><br><br>  Regarding the "reverse pull" - it is always believed that under-lighting is better than overexposure.  You can get the parts from under the light, from a strong overexposure, how many indicators from the matrix are not sharing, except for various shades of gray you will not get anything.  Nikon's RAW-format allows you to pull out well and overexposed parts of the frame, and not lose the details.  Yes, the picture is not very saturated, but it is any better than gray spots or purple highlights :) <br><br><h2>  <font color="#e40136">What do reviewers say</font> </h2><br>  The camera and its capabilities were examined in detail by Ferra.ru journalists, abroad a rather complete and interesting review was provided by the resource photographyblog.com. <br><br>  This is what our colleagues write. <br><blockquote>  Nikon 1 S2 has become noticeably better than its predecessor.  This is the merit of the sensor and the latest processor.  The matrix produces a better picture, including colors and noise.  Also worth noting is the incredible performance for the budgetless mirrorless, an interesting set of video capabilities and other features.  The camera requires getting used to the control system, it has a rather primitive display, and wireless communication is possible only after purchasing an external module.  Nikon 1 S2 is one of the most affordable and compact mirrorless to date. </blockquote>  <sup><a href="http://www.ferra.ru/ru/digiphoto/review/obzor-bezzerkalki-nikon1-s2/">Ferra.ru</a></sup> <br><br><blockquote>  It is a compact camera system, which makes it possible to make it easier to use it.  There are no wi-fi kit. lens - the more expensive J4 has a metal body, touchscreen LCD, more AF points, built-in wi-fi and ships with the better 10-30mm lens with vibration reduction.  If you‚Äôre looking at the camera, it‚Äôs not a problem. range-topping v3, makes sharing more difficult.  If you‚Äôre looking for something to do. </blockquote>  <sup><a href="http://www.photographyblog.com/reviews/nikon_1_s2_review/">Photographyblog</a></sup> <br><br>  As you can see, both publications mark a pleasant shooting quality and excellent work speed, especially considering the low (dollar) price of the device. <br><br>  In our material for Habr, we did not specifically go into synthetic research, simply because for photography enthusiasts there are more interesting models, and for use as a ‚Äúduty‚Äù camera at home with additional features, it is more interesting to get other information. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/ff1/00e/001/ff100e00139543f9903e44119a464a74.jpg"><br><br>  The camera perfectly ‚Äúshoots‚Äù in automatic mode.  It is possible to find fault with overexposure, but in most cases the frames are ‚Äúoptimal‚Äù.  Yes, the complete lens is not the best, there are no opportunities to install any accessories, but with all this, your grandmother and the five-year-old boy will cope with the Nikon 1 S2.  He brought in, saw a green frame, pressed a button, got a frame.  And if that - NEF will come to the rescue. <br><br><h2>  <font color="#e40136">Competitors</font> </h2><br>  The most interesting "alternative" option for this Nikon is the slightly more expensive <a href="http://www.ulmart.ru/goods/897793">Sony Alpha A500LS</a> .  Its price is nearly 20 thousand rubles, but here the controls are much clearer, and the matrix size is larger, and the wireless interfaces are available.  In addition, the camera comes bundled with a slightly more interesting lens (16-50).  Disadvantages, too, is, where do without them.  The camera has only contrast autofocus, and in terms of speed / tenacity is much inferior to Nikon. <br><br>  Another alternative is the <a href="http://www.ulmart.ru/goods/787201">Panasonic Lumix DMC-LX7</a> .  Price - about the same 20 thousand.  The camera is inferior to Nikon in the size of the matrix and as an autofocus system, but it has a full set of controls, an excellent interface and generally pleasant reviews both among amateurs and in the press.  Mastering the basics of "serious" photography, with full control over the parameters of the resulting frame on it will be easier. <br><br>  Nikon - really compact, very nice camera with a good quality of shooting.
