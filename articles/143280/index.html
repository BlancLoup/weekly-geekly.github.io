  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Startup preparation</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Regularly reading Habr, I noticed that very few articles were written about analytics of the development of services and the logic of building startups.  I believe that to raise this kind of topic is very useful for the community. <br><br>  I read a lot of posts about startups.  In all it is told about the possibilities, some indicators, ways of monetization, prospects, but in none I could not trace the logic that the team was guided by when developing the project. <br><br>  Although, it seems to me, the logic of the startup startup is much more interesting, because it reflects what is in the developer‚Äôs head, and not some quality indicators of the product.

      Soon there will be an official launch of our project, and I want to share with you the logic that I was guided by, creating and developing an idea. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  It seems to me that this post will be more useful for those who want to do something, as well as the description of the engine and some technical solutions when developing a car is much more useful for engineers of its parameters, indicated in the advertising booklets. <br><br>  So, I decided to make some kind of blogging platform / media.  And the platforms on which you can run your blog on the Internet are great.  I needed to come up with something special. <br><br>  Using social networks, I noticed a trend that can be easily traced by comparing the sites of VKontakte and Twitter. <br><br>  VKontakte most of the time (minus the time watching the video and listening to audio), the user spends in the message service. <br><br>  I have many friends in different cities, and I have to tell you several times a day how my things are. <br><br>  On Twitter, everything is much simpler, I tell you how my affairs are to anyone who is interested.  Users show interest by becoming my followers. <br><br>  And the desire of many users to broadcast information to a wide audience is felt very strongly. <br><br>  In other words, people aspire to become mass media. <br><br>  Vkontakte is a service designed to communicate with people you already know.  The team is making great efforts to make the bloggers appear on the site (they made subscribers, hid the information, raising the wall), but still it‚Äôs inconvenient to blog on VKontakte. <br><br>  Twitter is also not suitable as a blogging platform, because it is a microblogging service.  Photos and videos are opened by clicking on the link, there is no possibility to write a post, mentions appear in the ribbon.  Twitter is more like a chat. <br><br>  Learn morally obsolete.  Top authors have already been formed on this site, and it‚Äôs very difficult to become a popular blogger there.  No tools for promotion account.  Even if I write texts of very good quality, no one will know about me. <br><br>  So, we make the service convenient for people who want to gain a large audience of subscribers. <br><br>  The first thing I thought about was the quality of the content.  I want to see only interesting posts for me. <br><br>  VKontakte users are mostly content repeaters, not translators (authors). <br><br>  Few people will be engaged in repost photos with kebabs, but people relay with pleasure. <br><br>  As a result, my news page is full of demotivators, jokes and facepalm, they have a viral effect. <br><br>  Therefore, I decided that there should be no reposts on our blog platform. <br><br>  The lack of repost also increases the importance of the author in the eyes of the subscriber.  Instagram is a good example of this. <br><br>  In addition, we will not have comments, as in social networks, because 99% of comments are not interesting to read, they are annoying.  (Habr is an exception, because it is a narrowly self-regulating social network.) We do a service designed for a mass audience, where it is difficult to regulate content. <br><br>  <i>As a possible alternative to comments, I came up with a service of questions that performs three functions (It is worth noting that this idea has not yet been implemented and not approved)</i> <i><br><br></i>  <i>1. A user who has read the post may ask a question.</i>  <i>If the question seems interesting to the author, he will answer it and the question will be displayed under the post.</i>  <i>Thus, the author will be the moderator of the content under his post.</i> <i><br><br></i>  <i>2. The user can ask an open question to another user (the number of questions per day can be limited).</i>  <i>This opportunity may be of interest to famous people and their fans.</i> <i><br><br></i>  <i>3. The system itself can ask the user questions.</i> <i><br><br></i>  <i>Example:</i> <i><br></i>  <i>‚ÄúWhat kinds of music do you like: rock, rap, pop, classic?‚Äù</i> <i><br></i>  <i>Having received the answer ‚Äúrock‚Äù, the system asks a clarifying question:</i> <i><br></i>  <i>Which rock do you like better: domestic or foreign?</i> <i><br></i>  <i>And then the question directly about the rock band.</i>  <i>Naturally, there will be an opportunity to give your answer.</i> <i><br><br></i>  <i>This feature will allow you to search for friends by interests and narrowly target advertising, and subsequently create content that meets the most popular interests of users.</i> <i><br><br></i>  <i>For example, someone will write about Pugachev.</i>  <i>Anyone interested in it will automatically receive information about it.</i> <i><br><br></i>  <i>How development.</i>  <i>For example, I live in Nizhny Novgorod and listen to the group ‚ÄúCafe,‚Äù I have in my tape the post ‚ÄúCafe in your city there, there, at that time‚Äù.</i> <i><br><br></i>  <i>Of course, this gives great opportunities for monetization.</i> <br><br>  In our system (at least for now) there will be no message service.  On many sites, this service is implemented very well and we do not have much sense to duplicate it. <br><br>  In addition, we are interested in the user writing content that is accessible to his audience, and not to individuals. <br><br>  But, using the service, I realized that sometimes I really want to respond to the posts of friends and we made this opportunity. <br><br>  If Kolya and I are subscribed to each other, then we have the option ‚ÄúAnswer‚Äù.  I can respond to Kolya's publication, and Kolya can answer me.  These answers will be visible only to us, and I can only respond once to his post, and he can answer my answer once.  This is done so that the tape does not turn into a chat. <br><br>  We decided to make the main page, on which there will be posts selected by the moderator. <br><br>  Those.  the user, in addition to the tape, which displays the posts of those to whom it is subscribed, has the opportunity to read the tape from the posts of the authors, which we found interesting. <br><br>  In addition, each user will have a rating that depends on the activity on the site and the number of subscribers. <br><br>  Thus, hitting the user's post on the main page leads to an increase in the number of subscribers and rating. <br><br>  <i>There is also an idea that is not yet approved.</i> <i><br><br></i>  <i>There is a user search page.</i>  <i>Later it will be possible to sample people according to various criteria: city, gender, age, etc.</i> <i><br><br></i>  <i>On this page there is a special placement.</i> <i><br><br></i>  <i>Typing a certain rating, users will receive bonuses and will be able to buy time spent in special placement.</i>  <i>Probably, the special placement can be paid not only with bonuses.</i> <i><br></i> <br>  Another very important point is privacy. <br><br>  No one can find out who you are subscribed to.  There will be no email notifications like: ‚ÄúMasha has subscribed to you‚Äù <br><br>  This will save the site from massfollowing and smk-schikov. <br><br>  The goal of the maximum of our service is the selection of the most talented and interesting from the general mass of authors and the formation of free media with a wide audience adapted individually for each user. <br><br>  I am very interested to know your opinion about the concept and to hear thoughts about what you are missing on the Internet. <br><br>  If someone has any questions, I will try to answer them. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/143280/">https://habr.com/ru/post/143280/</a></p>
