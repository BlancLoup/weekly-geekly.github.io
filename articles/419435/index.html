This is facilitated by the development of IoT, the lack of a headphone jack in modern smartphones, as well as popular bluetooth speakers, wireless mice / keyboards, headsets, and more.  We decided to see what security recommendations are presented in the NIST standard for Bluetooth. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/oh/zx/on/ohzxon39zwzs1e9kjmckbq9azfe.gif"><br>  <i>Why the "blue tooth"?</i>  <i>The name Bluetooth came from the nickname of the Viking King Harald I of Sine-Teeth, who ruled Denmark in the 10th century and part of Norway.</i>  <i>During his reign, he united the hostile Danish tribes into a single kingdom.</i>  <i>By analogy, Bluetooth also unites, but not the land, but communication protocols.</i> <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  The first Bluetooth specification was developed by the Bluetooth Special Interest Group (Bluetooth SIG) in 1998 and published as part of the IEEE 802.15.1 standard on June 14, 2002. <br><br>  Currently there are the following specifications:

From the name, I think, the technology is clear - on both devices a six-digit number is shown, which allows identifying devices.  This method does not protect against MITM attacks. </li><li>  Just Works.  Since not all devices have a screen, such a mode was invented.  In fact, it is similar to "Numeric Comparison", but the number is always equal to "000000". </li><li>  Passkey Entry.  On one device shows the password that must be entered on the other. </li><li>  Out Of Band (OOB).  The most interesting method is to use additional protocols when pairing.  Illustrative examples: </li></ul><br>  Apple Watch shows a cloud of dots when pairing, which you need to scan with an iPhone camera. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/79/xd/j7/79xdj7ecgiewigfpxyxschahmqg.png"><br><br>  Use NFC between the headphones and the paired device. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/qt/xd/ga/qtxdgaqkry3ohwxrndgrfgpzlza.png"><br><br>  Depending on the type of Bluetooth device, the standard assumes various security modes (Security Mode). <br><br>  <i><b>Bluetooth BR / EDR / HS</b></i> <br><br><ul><li>  Security Mode 1 - lack of any protection.  Most often used only as part of testing.  NIST recommends that you never use this mode.  It still exists to maintain backward compatibility with older devices. </li><li>  Security Mode 2 ‚Äî Security functions can be initiated after a connection is established, but before a logical channel is established.  Security features control access to services.  In this mode, the concept of authorization is introduced - the process of determining whether a particular device is allowed to have access to a particular service. </li><li>  Security Mode 3 is a security mode whose functions operate at the channel level.  In this Bluetooth mode, the device initiates security procedures before the connection is fully established.  Bluetooth devices operating in security mode 3 authenticate and encrypt all connections to and from the device. </li><li>  Security Mode 4 is essentially an improvement in security mode 2. Security features are implemented after the connection is established  ECDH (Diffie-Hellman protocol on elliptic curves) is used to generate a link key.  This mode also has 5 levels of requirements (from 0 to 4) for implementation: </li></ul><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/au/xh/l8/auxhl8yaauoqq7l7cm9w1swwk6g.png"><br><br>  NIST, which is logical, recommends using Security Mode 4 Level 4 for this class of devices in all its specifications. <br><br>  Details of the mechanisms for generating keys, pairing devices, authentication, etc.  go beyond the article.  If desired, you can read them in the guide. <br><br>  <i><b>Bluetooth Low Energy</b></i> <br><br>  Low energy Security Mode 1 is a security mode that can be associated with the word ‚Äúencryption‚Äù.  It has several levels: <br><br><ul><li>  Level 1 - lack of any security.  No authentication, no encryption.  The saddest level in terms of security. </li><li>  Level 2 - allows pairing without device authentication, but with mandatory encryption. </li><li>  Level 3 - requires pairing with authentication and encryption. </li><li>  Level 4 - requires pairing with ‚Äúlow energy Secure Connections‚Äù authentication (using FIPS-approved algorithms - AES-CMAC and P-256 elliptic curve) and encryption. </li></ul><br>  Low energy Security Mode 2 is a security mode that can be associated with the phrase ‚Äúdata signature‚Äù.  Also has several levels: <br><br><ul><li>  Level 1 - pairing without authentication with data signature. </li><li>  Level 2 - data authentication pairing. </li></ul><br>  Before proceeding to the recommendations, consider the types of attacks on Bluetooth, to understand what we are protecting ourselves from. <br><br><h3>  Types of Bluetooth attacks </h3><br><ul><li>  Bluesnarfing is an attack that results in an attacker gaining access to data (often used to access IMEI) via Bluetooth devices that are not only turned on, but also set to ‚Äúaccessible to all‚Äù mode.  To implement this attack using flaws in the firmware devices. </li><li>  Bluejacking is a kind of Bluetooth spam (sometimes phishing).  The attacker could send messages to devices that have Bluetooth turned on. </li><li>  Carwhisperer - an attack on hands-free devices and other Bluetooth equipment without a display and keyboard (initially - handsfree in cars), reduced to the brutus of standard passwords.  In the case of a successful attack, the attacker can not only transmit their audio to the device, but also to eavesdrop. </li><li>  Denial of Service - like other wireless technologies, Bluetooth is susceptible to DoS attacks.  Impacts include the inability to use a Bluetooth device and the rapid discharge of the battery.  These types of attacks are not critical due to the short range of Bluetooth, and they can be easily prevented simply by stepping out of the range of the attacking transmitter. </li><li>  Pairing Eavesdropping - sniffing a Bluetooth broadcast to intercept frames sent during pairing devices.  An attacker, having these frames, can quickly figure out the secret key.  Only Bluetooth versions 2.0 and below are in PIN / Legacy pairing mode and Low Energy Bluetooth in Legacy pairing mode. </li><li>  Secure Simple Pairing Attacks - MITM attack on Bluetooth low energy devices operating in ‚ÄúJust Works‚Äù pairing mode. </li></ul><br>  * NIST also marks out an attack on Bluetooth, such as fuzzing, but as it seems to us, there is no point in this, since any protocol can be fuzzy. <br><br><h3>  Bluetooth Piconet Security Checklist </h3><br>  NIST offers a convenient table in which all recommendations are divided into two categories: ‚ÄúRecommended for implementation‚Äù and ‚ÄúShould be taken into account‚Äù.  The first category means that this recommendation is relevant for all organizations, and the second - depending on the capabilities of the organization, since the requirements for operation and costs increase. <br>  There is also a third column ‚ÄúStatus‚Äù, left blank for the auditors, so that they can check the items performed during the check. <br><table><tbody><tr><th>  No </th><th>  Recommendation </th><th>  Justification </th><th><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/dh/z5/ln/dhz5lnid4hazvvycljtzuea_j64.png"><nobr>‚Ää‚Äâ‚Äà ‚Ää‚Äâ‚Äà </nobr></th><th><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/28/oh/ne/28ohnehu-chdoykbxvdvyyc0dfk.png"><nobr>‚Ää‚Äâ‚Äà ‚Ää‚Äâ‚Äà </nobr></th><th><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/p6/0i/la/p60ilav1juc_wr2mx1bwdrcmpvu.png"><nobr>‚Ää‚Äâ‚Äà ‚Ää‚Äâ‚Äà </nobr></th></tr><tr><td colspan="6" align="center">  Organizational recommendations <br></td></tr><tr><td>  one <br></td><td>  Develop a Bluetooth wireless security organization policy. <br></td><td>  Security policy is the basis for all other countermeasures. <br></td><td align="center">  + <br></td><td align="center"></td><td align="center"></td></tr><tr><td>  2 <br></td><td>  Make sure that all Bluetooth users are familiar with the safety rules for using Bluetooth. <br></td><td>  A security awareness program helps users follow a practice that helps prevent security incidents. <br></td><td align="center">  + </td><td align="center"></td><td align="center"></td></tr><tr><td>  3 <br></td><td>  Regularly conduct comprehensive Bluetooth security assessments. <br></td><td>  Security assessments help identify the Bluetooth devices used in the organization, as well as help ensure compliance with wireless security policies. <br></td><td align="center">  + </td><td align="center"></td><td align="center"></td></tr><tr><td>  four <br></td><td>  Ensure that the Bluetooth wireless devices used are fully architecturally understood and documented accordingly. <br></td><td>  Bluetooth-enabled devices can contain various network technologies and interfaces that allow you to connect to local and global networks.
