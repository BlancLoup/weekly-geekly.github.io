When?".  For many, this is not a metaphor, but an exact description of a way of life.  Contrary to conventional irony, an ‚Äú80th-level elf‚Äù does not mean a loser in real life, and often the other way around ‚Äî it‚Äôs not by chance that the most expensive and powerful computers are not focused on a business that can solve its tasks while sitting on the old hemp on gamers. <br><br>  And no one has been playing only at home for a long time, the road takes too much time in life (especially in Moscow) to waste it - mobile gaming devices and mobile phones themselves successfully fill this space.  But the consumer loves when two in one, three in one, all in one - mobile phones and players, navigators and smartphones - have long merged into the same thing, now it‚Äôs time for gaming consoles.  The niche of powerful gaming phones has recently remained free - until the official release in February of this year, the <b>Sony Ericsson Xperia PLAY</b> . <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/83a210a3/6dcac1d5/54bef066/88041049.jpg">

      And last week, he finally arrived in a small white-green box for a test at the editor of this blog :) <br><br><a name="habracut"></a><h4>  What's in the box </h4><br>  On the packaging - two important icons.  The first is already a standard green robot, indicating the presence of Android on board, the second is the only PlayStation Certified token of its kind, indicating that Xperia PLAY is the first officially approved Android device for playing games with the PlayStation platform. <br><br>  The device is hidden in a sliding box, for the convenience of removing which on the side of the package there is even a special hole for a finger: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/24fe5c8a/cdf624e9/5aefd0bd/b650e64a.jpg"><br><br>  Inside the lodgement is the phone itself: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/b7712242/900ef4f7/81456e5c/7c9e2a7e.jpg"><br><br>  I got a white copy.  It happens, as it is easy to guess, also a black performance: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/cff513c9/98729439/d7f24f36/6f0a6da2.jpg"><br><br>  Boxing cover - with a ‚Äúdouble bottom‚Äù. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/421fc112/a36021b8/908b2c62/18281692.jpg"><br><br>  It hides a headset with a speaker - also white, and a standard set of pieces of paper - instructions and information about the radio frequency radiation of the phone: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/eef814d1/893d0264/477f041e/8c225402.jpg"><br><br>  Under the lodgement with the phone were the microUSB to USB adapter, battery and charger plug. <br><br>  Thus, the complete set of the phone, which I have not tested, includes a standard set of cord, charging and 8 GB memory card.  However, those who buy PLAY in the store are more lucky: the package that comes in Russia includes a 16GB memory card and a phone case. <br><br><h4>  Housing </h4><br>  Made in the form factor "side slider", the phone turned out to be quite plump.  The back wall of the phone is convex, which is familiar from previous Xperia models - so that the mobile phone is more comfortable to lie in the palm of your hand: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/04746fdb/288cb77c/87457545/1d3a802f.jpg"><br><br>  The cover is thin, and can be removed quite easily.  But the main surprise (pleasant) layout - under it.  Connectors for sim-card and memory card are made so that to use them do not need to remove the battery!  That is, it will be easier to change the SIM-card, and it does not require completely cutting the phone down. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/83f09a21/c3cc6ccb/8233d4ab/0904aeef.jpg"><br><br>  True, you still have to restart, because otherwise the device will not see the new SIM card.  Theoretically, turning on the flight mode should do without rebooting, but for some reason it never worked for me. <br><br><h4>  Design and ergonomics </h4><br>  White with rounded edges - the phone looks very nice, somewhat resembling the white flying girlfriend Wall-E from the cartoon of the same name.  The truth is that, as the people who watched the cartoon recall, could occasionally pull out the laser and zhahnut it so the mother doesn‚Äôt worry, but the Xperia PLAY‚Äôs features are not worse - if you want, from the laser, if you want to drop the gun, it‚Äôs still a cool gaming smartphone. <br><br>  It lies in the hand, despite the considerable thickness of the case (16 mm, by the way - before this thickness could be the most common, never a slider, phone) is convenient - its roundness is pleasant not only in appearance but also in touch. <br><br>  The main innovation is seen at the first look at the case - four function keys below.  The search key was added to the menu, back and home - the dreams of the fans who lacked the search ‚Äúlike on other phones‚Äù came true: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/945031cc/80317e7e/95904ae8/040096ee.jpg"><br><br>  A button, no doubt convenient - when you need to start a search in maps, for example.  But because of it, the other three, much more frequently used keys, have become smaller and getting to them by touch with the move does not always work out - this is not ‚Äúleft, right and center‚Äù. <br><br>  The side surfaces are made of silver ‚Äúchrome-free‚Äù plastic.  On the left are the connectors for headphones and USB-lace, and on the right - the volume rocker and the ‚Äúpetals‚Äù of control from the gaming console: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/6ea8008d/89fb735d/d65be3a0/d486ee61.jpg"><br><br>  The off button is traditionally on top. <br><br>  A rare innovation: there is no hard key on the phone photo.  The application icon can be displayed, if desired, on the desktop or the taskbar, but you will have to take pictures using the button on the screen.  Unusually. <br><br><h4>  Control panel of the universe </h4><br>  The main buttons of this phone are hidden on the retractable remote control: these are the four control arrows and four geometric buttons familiar to all PlayStation fans, located under the thumbs of the left and right hands, respectively. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/a1a58aba/db18eacd/90a05159/44d51f0b.jpg"><br><br>  For those who are used to be controlled by the joystick, there are two small round touchpads as a replacement.  The position of the fingers in the center is suggested by two small, but perfectly tangible to the touch, buttons in the center.  And between the "joysticks" - the usual touchpad: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/a738b542/055ca619/f9a4ec28/ee833fe2.jpg"><br><br>  Petals on the back cover sharpened by the index fingers. <br><br><h4>  Time to kill </h4><br>  The main function of most phones has long been no calls: this is a universal tool for killing time.  See what your neighbors in the subway or minibus are busy with?  Sms, internet surfing, music, less often - watching videos.  But basically it's still a game.  Increasingly, I hear that a personal car is not needed in Moscow - with the advent of Xperia PLAY, this statement became even more relevant - how can I spend 2-3 hours, which an average Muscovite spends a day on the road, on a dull crush in traffic jams when You can at this time save the galaxy, kick ass opponents of Bruce Lee (or Bruce Lee himself) or break away on a highway where terrible capital traffic is impossible in principle. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/aa6746aa/a7597e66/6749e4ba/0c971fc8.jpg"><br><br>  There are several games preinstalled on the phone: <br><ul><li>  FIFA 10 </li><li>  The sims 3 </li><li>  Star battalion </li><li>  Bruce lee </li><li>  Crash Bandicoot </li><li>  and Tetris </li></ul>  In order to better assess the possibilities of PLAY, I set myself three more games: <br><ul><li>  Raging Thunder 2 - a simple arcade racer, instead of the expected, but not yet released for PLAY Need For Speed </li><li>  On the advice of <a href="http://sonyericsson.livejournal.com/83426.html%3Fnc%3D1%26style%3Dmine">colleagues from LJ Sony Ericsson</a> - new items from Gameloft BackStab </li><li>  And Tower Bloxx's favorite kazualka - it stood as the default game even on my very first Sony Ericsson, and therefore since then I have the warmest feelings for it. </li></ul>  To find and buy games on your phone, the Xperia PLAY application is preinstalled: it displays all the games that are currently installed on your phone: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/a93c25d4/daf4ae50/572980f2/00dd6a44.jpg"><br><br>  Also available in the special channel of the Android Market games for Xperia PLAY: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/5c527843/f19d7849/9a3dc65c/5a651163.jpg"><br><br>  By the way, more recently, any Sony Ericsson Xperia user on Android, going to the Market, will see a special link with the Sony Ericsson handset icon, which hides the channel of applications and games recommended for Sony Ericsson - the company became the first Android phone manufacturer to do this. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/ef6a9bd9/3a0f91d5/ff0e928f/13c4a9ea.jpg"><br><br>  And the actual games for Xperia PLAY, except through the Xperia PLAY app, can be found by searching the market for the keywords XPERIA PLAY optimized. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/064c954b/2f35d8ae/5485dccb/e06acc21.jpg"><br><br><h4>  Toys </h4><br>  The duty of the browser made me run all the games installed on the phone at least once. <br><br>  But, being a fan of Asimov, Bujold, cosmic science fiction and Star Wars (‚ÄúThere is only one true trilogy, and this is not‚Äú The Lord of the Rings ‚Äù!‚Äù) I immediately hooked on <a href="http://www.starbattalion.com/">Star Battalion</a> from Gameloft. <br><br>  The fun shooter introduces the player to the world, made up of painfully familiar plot bricks: the fallen space republic, whose leader was overthrown by his own brother, who is building his own empire on the ruins, a small brave group of Resistance pilots led by a brave but slightly impulsive guy. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/dfcb8e7a/6f4d24db/9e379780/0e73c669.jpg"><br><br>  What is the resolution of 854x480 you can estimate from this screenshot: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/70c2ad08/06cb165e/d7cfc8e2/0a0ef914.jpg"><br><br>  - on the big screen you can see that the detailing is lame, but on a 4-inch screen it looks just gorgeous: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/4ae80f5c/32cd8dfd/f0c07cc1/56b99789.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/6c6468c6/4350e931/1aa66fab/dd951bc9.jpg"><br><br>  One of the advantages of the game is complete Russification.  FIFA 10, for example, cannot boast about it - but it doesn‚Äôt interfere much, because football terms are universal, and there‚Äôs no need to know anything more. <br><br>  Performing various tasks, the player can fly on a wide variety of combat vehicles. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/cc2f69f9/41cdd1d3/b232d9e7/bc275d34.jpg"><br><br>  I'll pay tribute to the convenience of control using the Xperia PLAY gamepad: dodging enemy salvoes and targeting the enemy's technology, you will use all the main control keys to complete, and everything is really comfortable and ergonomic - except that the arrangement of the ‚Äúpetals‚Äù on the back cover would be more convenient for people with short index fingers (girls, for example), but they themselves lack the clarity of clicks - in moments when you need to dodge an enemy gun, you involuntarily press them twice in a row to make sure - well, you make a barrel  two times instead of one. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/cbb093fe/d7a603cf/3bc4219b/0ef461d9.jpg"><br><br>  Of course, you can play with the pushed gamepad, in the touchscreen mode - maybe even it will seem more comfortable to someone, but that feeling of control over the situation, which gives tactile sensible keystrokes, will no longer be.  And the screen will be permanently closed by fingers for a quarter. <br><br>  But to drive in Raging Thunder 2 I found it subjectively easier using the accelerometer, controlling the entire body of the smartphone. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/f28d2348/3ba54f53/6a30460f/232b62fe.jpg"><br><br>  The game is clearly sharpened under this ‚Äúdriving style‚Äù, because the control from the gamepad is turned off by default and is enabled in the game settings. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/5cf3c522/25c17588/c0278002/912ac7fc.jpg"><br><br>  As for the impressions of the game, the arcade is such an arcade game.  On some tracks, having started the race, you can simply put the smartphone nearby - in many cases, after 10 seconds you will still be in the peloton. <br><br>  Tower Bloxx kazualka causes affection, but it seems to me that all the bells and whistles of this game are its beauty in simplicity: know yourself to drop the cubes one on another in time to make a skyscraper higher. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/c16bf7de/8aa99468/fbb9f124/3fce479a.jpg"><br><br>  Only Tetris was puzzled - the beauty of this game has always been that you can play it without thinking at all, pressing a couple of buttons on the machine and building a level after level - the perfect way to take your hands and unload the brain.  But Tetris with a touchscreen (the gamepad is useless in this case) requires constant finger poking at the screen and concentration as some kind of full-fledged shooter.  This game is only for real fans of rotating geometric figures. <br><br><h4>  At the apparatus </h4><br>  This console also knows how to call!  At least, when during a sparring with another opponent, the bell rang, the first thought was exactly that.  Yes, this is still a telephone (although I doubt that when buying a device for 25,000 rubles, someone will pay all this money precisely for the ability of voice communication). <br><br>  In general, it is a good smartphone on Android.  The interface is almost identical to the one that was recently reviewed on the Sony Ericsson Xperia arc with the same Gingerbread on board. <br><br>  So, I liked the organization of the phone functionality of the smartphone itself: just like arc, contacts, calls, dialing are combined into a common panel - when entering any of the listed menus, you can easily switch to the following - now to switch to the list of recently dialed numbers from contacts You do not need to exit the menu at all, and then go to the list of calls. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/bd224afd/64e7d999/04f4c6b2/1cd147cc.jpg"><br><br>  And the same convenient organization of widgets: all at the user's disposal are five desktops, where he can display widgets (in the menu they are called ‚Äúgraphic elements‚Äù), shortcuts, create folders: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/4c7699aa/92ba2ac9/3fb392ed/3f90542e.jpg"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/9fc0d66b/b8cba94c/42136fd7/d66604a1.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/6bee33f6/6d8365f0/60f76775/2d0cf52d.jpg"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/4a4b6242/4dedd35b/e3e0b15e/a65a1b63.jpg"><br><br>  The screen of the phone, like that of the recently released arc, is protected by default with a film.  It looks neater and reliable handicraft sticking, and for a phone that is doomed to watch the most intensive operation, it is very important. <br><br><h4>  Evening exercise </h4><br>  Speaking of gaming smartphone, ignore its long-play.  The promised five hours in the game mode (well, maybe not in a row, but interrupted by calls, conversations and Internet surfing on wi-fi) the phone keeps.  If the games do not get carried away, then a day is enough.  God knows that, but this can already be said to be the ‚Äúcorporate standard‚Äù for Android devices. <br><br>  Fortunately, the computer is always at hand and to charge the phone is not a problem.  Another thing is that in the general abundance of wires from all sorts of charge, power supplies, etc.  you understand that the most expected progress in progress is now wireless charging. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/f06f1e82/55c399cd/a3f6cf53/b96b8ac2.jpg"><br><br>  I can not disagree with <a href="http://lenta.ru/articles/2011/04/20/play/">colleagues from Lenta.ru</a> , Yandex.Maps (or Google Maps, to whom that is closer) - the main battery is the battery.  With navigation turned on, they ate up to half of the total battery consumption. <br><br><h4>  Character - Nordic </h4><br>  And finally, the characteristics of the Sony Ericsson Xperia PLAY.  The numbers are for those interested, but behind them we see just another good-quality, powerful modern Android smartphone ... If only of course in the case of Xperia PLAY it would be only in numbers.  So, <br><br>  <b>Screen:</b> <br><ul><li>  16,777,216 TFT color display - equipped with a protective film, tightly and imperceptibly even fitted at the factory. </li><li>  Capacitive multitouch </li><li>  4 ", 480 x 854 pixels (FWVGA) </li></ul>  <b>Size:</b> 119 x 62 x 16 mm <br><br>  <b>Weight:</b> 175 grams <br><br>  <b>Phone memory:</b> up to 400MB <br><br>  Support for memory cards - microSD, up to 32 GB (16GB included) <br><br>  <b>Operating system:</b> Google Android 2.3 (Gingerbread) <br><br>  <b>Processor:</b> 1 GHz ScorpionARMv7 <br><br>  <b>Working hours:</b> <br><ul><li>  talk time - up to 8 hours 25 minutes </li><li>  standby time - up to 425 hours </li><li>  in game mode - up to 5 hours and 35 minutes </li><li>  MP3 playback: up to 30 hours 35 minutes </li></ul>  <b>Camera:</b> <br><ul><li>  5.1 MP with autofocus </li><li>  Flash / Backlight </li></ul>  <b>Wi-Fi</b> with the ability to use the smartphone to distribute it <br><br><h4>  And instead of the epilogue </h4><br>  Sony Ericsson Xperia Play is already <a href="">on Yandex.Market, priced from 23,900 to 27,990 rubles</a> .  There is a telephone - but there are no competitors. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/15cc8d29/71580d53/298cb1d4/e19b9d2a.jpg"><br><br>  Even without the name of the powerful PlayStation brand behind, Xperia PLAY remains a thoughtful and powerful mobile gaming device that enables full control of games using a gamepad, while remaining a quality smartphone for business and entertainment. <br><br>  Do not miss the Sony Ericsson news and reviews of new products - subscribe to <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/sonyericsson/blog/">our blog</a> . <br><br>  <b>It's time to PLAY;)</b> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/117912/">https://habr.com/ru/post/117912/</a></p>
