But if you wander through different soft-directories and search for something with the word antivirus, you can find some very interesting things. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  <b>5th place ‚ÄúBull Antivirus‚Äù</b> : <a href="http://download.cnet.com/Bull-Antivirus/3000-2239_4-76174162.html">download.cnet.com/Bull-Antivirus/3000-2239_4-76174162.html</a> <br><br>  This wonderful product is found on CNET Download.com.  Opposite the price indicated ‚ÄúFree;  $ 59 to buy ‚Äù, which, apparently, means the need in the near future to give him a measly 59 bucks.  Namely - April 27, judging by the inscription "Valid up to 04.27.2015".  The antivirus itself is in a zip archive, in a folder with the promising name ‚ÄúDEBUG‚Äù.  Although the site says "Bull Antivirus", but the installed program has the name "Bull Security".  To install it, you had to agree with the Microsoft license (!).

But when I decided to install it again to make additional screenshots, after closing the window with an error message, the program itself began to close.  What does this have to do with the antivirus and where the antivirus itself remains a mystery.  Particularly pleased with the inscription in the translation, saying "Your computer is fully protected." <br><br>  <b>4th place "Element Anti-Virus"</b> : <a href="http://download.cnet.com/Element-Anti-Virus/3000-2239_4-75326846.html">download.cnet.com/Element-Anti-Virus/3000-2239_4-75326846.html</a> <br><br>  Many antiviruses happen to have false positives, which is difficult to surprise in our time.  But Element Anti-Virus, which cost 40 dollars and 72 cents (which is the exact price!)), To which, by the way, a rather big article in the English-language Wikipedia is devoted, surpassed everyone - he declared an empty 2-byte file as a very dangerous malware. <br><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Critical threats in the Windows folder</b> <div class="spoiler_text"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/085/3f8/e2b/0853f8e2b80afa2c920fe887a9b4c8b6.gif" alt="image"><br></div></div><br><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Threat on closer inspection</b> <div class="spoiler_text"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/94a/02a/28d/94a02a28d1cae0bfd77a07b6ee4b2432.gif" alt="image"><br></div></div><br>  Compared to this, firing into the standard Microsoft C Runtime Library will seem like a childish prank. <br><br>  <b>3rd place ‚ÄúAmir-Antivirus‚Äù</b> : <a href="http://amir-antivirus.en.softonic.com/">amir-antivirus.en.softonic.com</a> <br>  This program has a very high rating in the softonic.com software catalog - 9.7 with 50 voters.  Deciding to find out why users love her so much, he entrusted her with checking out his flash drive.  And as it turned out - in vain.  Without any warning, without any questions, directly during the scan, she began to delete file after file. <br><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">There were files and no</b> <div class="spoiler_text"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/702/405/187/702405187c9207beb3786caa992662ad.gif" alt="image"><br></div></div><br>  I frantically pressed cancel, but it was too late.  Having destroyed several program files (in particular, having corrupted the portable version of SoftMaker FreeOffice), she also took pity on one of the files and sent it to the quarantine organized all on the same flash drive than completely deleted the deleted files, making it impossible to restore them even with the help of specialized utilities.  By destructive action, this ‚Äúproduct‚Äù almost caught up with some ‚Äúdisk encryptors‚Äù. <br><br>  <b>2nd place ‚ÄúRedtex AntiVirus‚Äù</b> : <a href="http://download.cnet.com/RedTex-AntiVirus/3000-2239_4-75372831.html">download.cnet.com/RedTex-AntiVirus/3000-2239_4-75372831.html</a> <br><br>  I was not going to write about fake antiviruses, but this ‚Äúproduct‚Äù is located on the well-known soft-directory download.cnet.com, from where it has been distributed with impunity since February 15, 2011.  When I tried to install this wonderful program, I found that instead of installing an antivirus, the ‚ÄúConduit‚Äù toolbar is being installed into the Internet Explorer browser, and the shortcut in the menu leads not to the program, but to the site from which the scan imitating scanning is visible.  What, however, will be downloaded from it on day X, is known only to the author.  Browser hijacker + fake backdoor shortcut = new anti-virus recipe?

He does not know how to treat infected machines. <br>  2. He does not know how to remove threats. <br>  3. He does not know how to fix the flaws in safety. <br>  4. He does not know how to protect in real time. <br>  5. He does not know how to perform a full or selective scan. <br>  6. He cannot see that his bases almost 4 months old are no longer relevant. <br>  7. He can not display the amount of memory if it is less than 1 GB <br>  8. He does not even know that the word ‚Äúestablished‚Äù is spelled with two ‚ÄúH‚Äù. <br><br>  All that he knows how useful is to scan something (such a scan is usually called fast) using hopelessly outdated databases and make foolish warnings, for example, about changing the browser home page. <br><br>  But: <br><br>  1. He is a paid product loader. <br>  2. It is a paid product ad. <br>  3. He constantly opens his website with ads. <br>  4. He constantly uploads news with ads. <br>  5. He collects detailed information about you and automatically sends it to the developers. <br>  6. It installs adware. <br>  7. It, according to the license agreement, can send your files to developers. <br>  8.
