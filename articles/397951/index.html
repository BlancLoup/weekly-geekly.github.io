  <section class="page js-page"><h1>The tree is back in fashion: Fostex TH-610 headphones</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Hi, Giktayms!  For some, music is one of the ways to escape from reality into your cozy world, others use their favorite tracks to relax after work, and some, on the contrary, cannot perform daily tasks without music (no, we are not talking about DJs and dancers ).  Why such a lyrical introduction?  The fact is that largely because of this, the approach to choosing headphones is often comparable to finding a new car.  And when the headphones are worth tens of thousands of rubles, it does not scare, if the characteristics correspond to the stated price. <br><br> <a href="https://geektimes.ru/company/hfhe/blog/281076/"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/28b/109/f34/28b109f34ea973887e1c2195e3c1ba27.jpg"></a> <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  As you probably guessed, today we were offered not just ‚Äúgags‚Äù for a couple of thousand rubles, but the representative of the premium segment.  In general, the very concept of ‚Äúpremium‚Äù in the world of sound is very vague: this category can be attributed to the same Audio-Technica ATH-W5000 for 80+ thousand rubles, and HiFiMan HE-1000 for 200 thousand rubles or something even more expensive .  So our hero, we assign to the class of "initial premium" (Why? Find out at the end).  Meet the updated <a href="http://fostexsound.ru/products/headband/th-610/">Fostex TH-610</a> . <br><br>  Few people are familiar with the Japanese company Fostex, but just in case there is a small historical background: it has been on the sound market for more than 40 years (one of the pioneers of the Regular phase) and specializes in equipment for acoustic systems.  The more interesting to look at her headphones closer.

In fact, the headphones have become a follower of the famous TH-600, and judging by the similarity of the new Massdrop TH-X00, it is clear which model was taken as the basis for creating the Fostex TH-610.  However, the TH-X00 at one time received a nomination for SuperBestAudioFriends in the nomination "Headphones of the Year", so it is even good. <br><br><h2>  Equipment </h2><br>  Not to say that the absence of anything significant in the box other than the headphones themselves surprised us - this approach is peculiar not only to Fostex, but also to many other manufacturers of closed dynamic headphones.  The detachable cable, carrying case and the Fostex TH-610, which we will now look at in more detail. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/485/bbc/026/485bbc0264d49663f726698df1496bd7.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/336/6a2/caa/3366a2caa8c3b4b44b47fe28070b0d3e.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/e10/428/458/e10428458d155ef738af3f577e4e4049.jpg"><br><br><h2>  Appearance </h2><br>  If the TH-600 cups were made of magnesium alloy, in the new model, the manufacturer decided to replace it with black walnut wood with a matte finish.  The use of wood in headphones can hardly be called a step back: this material will still be popular for a long time, and not only among audiophiles. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/ca7/15e/ab3/ca715eab3b4e50cdde99609aedc3c1f1.jpg"><br><br>  The ear cushions are made of soft natural leather, comfortably fit the ears, are pleasant and do not cause irritation or sweating, as is typical of some headphones with leather ear pads. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/c7d/011/adf/c7d011adf467a8d49c90ae34636caeba.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/df5/b35/89a/df5b3589a5ff55c2c941a6a73021f563.jpg"><br><br>  The headband is wide and flexible, it is also trimmed with genuine leather.  Due to the decent width, you can easily wear headphones with glasses, adjusting so that the ears will not push anything. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/2f2/c0a/5f4/2f2c0a5f44f33bdd391ea5b5fe83c2e5.jpg"><br><br>  With this combination of materials look TH-610 expensive, not every day you meet on the street black walnut wood.  On the head, the headphones sit comfortably, one feels not so much dimensions as weight: the headphones themselves weigh 375 g. Plus a three-meter cable weighing 120 g. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/002/52a/5fc/00252a5fc505741d8fa7f66f33a6be2e.jpg"><br><br>  The cable here, by the way, is not only long and two-contact, but also wear-resistant, the contact part is covered with rhodium.  Optionally, it is changed to a balanced cable ET-H3.0N7BL with a four-pin XLR connector - the opportunity is borrowed from the TH-900 MK2. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/064/cde/0b7/064cde0b72bc863c427e8c47b01233f9.jpg"><br><br><h2>  Specifications </h2><br><table><tbody><tr><td>  Headphone Type <br></td><td>  Closed, dynamic <br></td></tr><tr><td>  Diaphragm diameter <br></td><td>  50 mm <br></td></tr><tr><td>  Impedance <br></td><td>  25 ohm <br></td></tr><tr><td>  Sensitivity <br></td><td> 98 dB / mW <br></td></tr><tr><td>  Maximum input power <br></td><td>  1800 mW <br></td></tr><tr><td>  Frequency range <br></td><td>  5 - 45 000 Hz <br></td></tr><tr><td>  Plug <br></td><td>  6.3mm, two-pin <br></td></tr><tr><td>  Length of cable <br></td><td>  3 meters <br></td></tr></tbody></table><br>  The TH-610 also boasts a 50mm dynamic emitter with biocell membranes with the tricky name Biodyna.  Special attention is given to the magnetic system of neodymium with an induction of 1 T - all this allowed Fostex to achieve a low level of distortion and a wide dynamic range.  A small specific gravity and a high modulus of elasticity provide a twofold increase in the wave propagation velocity. <br><br>  Double-sided detachable cable conductors are made of purified HiFC copper from Hitachi.  The material contains a small amount of titanium and has a high conductivity, which does not affect the flexibility and ductility.  According to the latest characteristics, it is not inferior to oxygen-free copper with 6N purification, where the copper content is 99.999999%.  The rhodium coating of connectors protects against oxidation. <br><br>  The TH-610‚Äôs excellent compatibility with portable devices is guaranteed by a low impedance of 25 ohms.  A wide range of frequencies up to 45 kHz and high sensitivity - a couple more pluses to Fostex karma. <br><br><h2>  Sound </h2><br>  According to the sound characteristics, it would be obvious to compare the TH-610 with the TH-600 or the same Massdrop TH-X00.  However, as it turned out, only the design was borrowed from the latter: the sound of the novelty is a more balanced version of the TH-600.  Unlike its predecessor, the TH-610 does not have a serious emphasis on bass, but the high frequencies are well felt.  They do not have a serious peak like the TH-900, and it pleased. <br><br>  In general, the headphones sound like a full-fledged representative of the top (premium) segment - the scene is voluminous, the instruments work perfectly.  Hooray comes as a rock with electronic music, and hip-hop (deep bass, however, you should not wait here).  Since the evaluation of the sound is a purely subjective thing, let's say one thing: you have to try.  Despite not quite familiar to Fostex handwriting, headphones will appeal to many. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/532/0c2/770/5320c27708c7fd5aca7ea89356023d67.jpg"><br><br>  If you want to change something, there is a possibility, if I may say so, ‚Äúcustomize the sound‚Äù by replacing the cable with another one.  But this, perhaps, will deal only with true audiophiles. <br><br><h2>  Good to know </h2><br>  Due to its weight and dimensions, the TH-610 is not designed for you to walk down the street with them every day.  Actually, the manufacturer himself indirectly asserts this when he puts a three-meter cable into the box.  Therefore, these headphones are created more for the home (well, or work, although for someone it's the same thing).  Enthusiasts, of course, manage to wind a long cable into a pocket, but this decision is unlikely to be appreciated by everyone. <br><br><h2>  Small total </h2><br>  It sounds like a premium, it looks the same, so why at the very beginning we attributed these headphones to the ‚Äúinitial premium‚Äù class?  Perhaps only because of the price, which is about 45 thousand rubles.  Typically, for such a cost, manufacturers give the opportunity to buy the so-called "predtopy", while here we get quite a top sound.  <a href="http://fostexsound.ru/products/headband/th-610/">Fostex TH-610</a> can be called one of the best headphones in the segment up to 50-60 thousand rubles. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/397951/">https://habr.com/ru/post/397951/</a></p>
