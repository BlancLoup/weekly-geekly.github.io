      <a href="http://www.rodmost.ru/">Parental bridge</a> <br>  Natalya Preobrazhenskaya <br><br>  ‚ÄúParental Bridge‚Äù is one of the first charitable organizations in Russia, which began its work in 1985.  Today this organization unites a team of like-minded people acting in the interests of children in the name of saving them from their orphanhood.  The Foundation helps people willing to adopt children, accompanies families with foster children, provides legal, psychological, and medical assistance to families and individual parents in a crisis situation. <br><br>  In 2005, the foundation created its website, where it began to acquaint people with its activities through the world wide web, talk about upcoming events, give people the opportunity to help others.  And through such a connection, people began to be in need of help, who could not find answers to their questions, which we were able to support.  The site has become one of the help channels. <br><br>  Today we are not satisfied with what has already been achieved and intend to develop the site further even more actively, because through it more and more people come to us who really need our help.  And TrueVDS helped us a lot with this by highlighting a grant for our project. <br><br>  The site uses Bitrix, and it is really good.  But there are some sections, for example, a forum or gallery that I would like to improve, so it is planned to ‚Äúimplant‚Äù engines into Bitrix that would help us achieve the desired result.  Website attendance averages about a thousand views per day. <br><br>  In our plans to make the site as convenient and understandable as possible.  It is planned to restructure the portal, completely change the appearance.  In our goals, increasing the number of users and interaction with them, the forum will be changed for this.  In addition, our site will also serve as a major information portal on the subject and focus of the foundation, where you can find information on many interesting issues, such as, for example, legislation, practical advice from psychologists, links to useful resources, and so on. <br><br>  <a href="http://3dfind.ru/">3D Find.ru</a> <br>  Gennady Koveshnikov <br><br>  The 3D Find.ru project aims to make life easier for people who are closely connected with 3D models.  We provide fast and convenient search in the database of models, and also give the opportunity to quickly download them.  One of the main features of our service is that we are trying to go as far as possible to the concept of web 2.0, i.e.  social web.  Our community can influence the results.  To do this, we have created 2 methods of regulation - rating models and editing tags.  We also provide various ways to display the results.  For example, you can display results by date added, rating, or number of downloads. <br><br>  The project appeared quite by accident.  Once at the end of August, I thought that I wanted to learn php, but I also wanted to see the result of my efforts right away.  So the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãthe project first appeared, and then, after 10 days, the working prototype of the site.  Then, for about a month, I ‚Äúdoped‚Äù it and introduced new functions.  After hard work on the site, i.e.  after we wrote the second version of the search, which knows what we demand from it, we began to think about where to go and what advantages we have over competitors.  Actually, it turned out that we have a fairly advantageous presentation of information, namely, all our information (by this I mean the 3D model itself and everything connected with it) is tied to tags that search for information.  On the websites of our competitors everything is different: usually on all sites there is a description of the model, which is difficult to translate automatically, and also the quality of the text is lost during translation.  In our case, everything is much simpler: any tag that represents 1-2 words can be easily translated and done so without loss of quality.  In this we feel our competitive advantage. <br><br>  The search engine corresponded 2 times, and soon we plan 3 times.  This will be due to the optimization of the resources used + I want to redesign. <br><br><br><br>  PS If you develop a useful and interesting Internet project demanded by society, <a href="">apply</a> for a grant to a free server.
