TimeCoder in his article mentioned the light cone in the context of the merging of realities.  However, let's look at the same example of the space-time jump itself. <br><br>  In the simplest case, we can consider our space as time, as a four-dimensional array, in which a time coordinate corresponds to each group of spatial coordinates.  You can consider the model otherwise, as a one-dimensional array of spaces.  Those.  there is a copy space in each cell of the array.  We perceive the world linearly, as if reading this one-dimensional array from left to right during life.  Such a model excludes any branching; only the assumption is possible that there are a number of such arrays and they are not related to each other.  This case is not interesting for us, it practically leaves us with neither the opportunity to choose nor the opportunity to sing.  Our world in such a reality is like a film, where all events are predetermined.  Therefore, let us go further in our assumptions and assume that our temporary array is two-dimensional (or even three-dimensional). <br><br>  It would be possible to consider just a five-dimensional array, but speaking only about time, I want to separate it more strictly from our perception of space, so let the three spatial coordinates be just an abstract point in the time array.  This situation is similar, already parsed by TimeCoder, with the difference that we do not create universes, but they exist all together and in parallel, and the further they are from some piece we are considering, the more ambitious the changes between them are.  Let's say two neighboring universes will not differ for a simple inhabitant with anything: in the sandbox in the yard there will be one more grain of sand, a daisy in the garden will not grow with the number of petals, etc.  However, the further we deviate along the axis of the universes, the more significant the changes will be. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/bb6/a01/c01/bb6a01c01f900acf5bbd1a9a3ff11618.png"><br>  <i>A is the starting point, B, C is a segment in time for which a landing is possible, ABC is a triangle (or a cone, if time is three-dimensional) of probable deviations.</i>  <i>Green dots - parallel travelers</i>

      We introduce the time traveler model.  He wants to jump from his present into his past.  Can we be sure that his jump is absolutely accurate?  Or are distortions and influences both inside and outside the system possible?  Roughly speaking, can we say that the ‚Äútouchdown‚Äù point will not be rejected, as it happens with a jump in space?  Of course, the farther the jump, the larger the object to move, the more likely the deviation.  Although, it is, of course, a question of the accuracy of instruments and formulas.  Jumping a minute ago, you can allow almost one hundred percent hit.  But this ‚Äúalmost‚Äù changes a lot.  Now let us recall the fact that there are very similar universes near us, practically indistinguishable from ours.  And in them live copies of our traveler, who at the same time or almost simultaneously with him make the jump (Looks like the plot of the series <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0112167/%3Fref_%3Dsr_1">Sliders</a> , isn't it?).  Where will they be?  If they didn‚Äôt jump deep in time, the spread was most likely negligible.  To distinguish the universes of the eye jumpers are not capable  If we assume the existence of instruments that measure changes in space (analogous to the TimeCoder program), can they be trusted not by an outside observer, but by the direct participant, especially at small jump distances?  After all, even if our traveler gets into his past, the system will still be changed.  I confess that it seems to me personally that, within the framework of the model being described, a jump to one‚Äôs own universe is simply not possible.  After all, when you take a leap in space, it takes including some time.  Making a leap in time, by analogy (if it is appropriate, refute if I am mistaken), there should be a shift in the universes. <br><br>  In this model there is always a set of conditionally simultaneously occurring versions of the event.  In our case, this is a leap into the past.  Many copies of the traveler make the jump.  The deeper the jump takes place - the higher the deviation, i.e.  the higher the likelihood that it will be in possession is not in its universe.  The farther the universe is from what we are considering, the different events and states of the jump will flow there (for example, at another time point, or they will not flow at all).  Any change in the past will have an effect, of course, on the universe in which the traveler fell, in this case, even the grandfather's paradox does not trouble him. <br><br>  The question of predetermination is curious for this model.  The fact that it‚Äôs not likely to get into its universe when traveling is more likely than to get into it (if at all possible), the impact on other universes should in no way affect the original one.  Therefore, from this point of view, the question of predestination should not stand.  On the other hand, the parallel universe until the moment of the jump was in a certain state.  Will she return with the past time to her state, as it was before the jump into the past, or will her state change beyond recognition?  And if these universes were near, and before the creation of the time machine were very similar?  It turns out that the neighboring universes will be noticeably different after a series of such journeys. <br><br>  It would seem that this model allows the appearance of several jumpers in the same universe.  Whether entities will break them into pieces or merge will occur, an open question, I want to believe in a merger, but then the question of return arises - one of the travelers will inevitably not return home.  Actually the topic of return in this regard is no less intriguing.  Will the jumper be able to return to his universe without luck and chance? <br><br>  <b>PS</b> When I started this messy writings, I, it seems, did not see all the similarities with the plot of the above-mentioned series.  It seems to use just this model.  An example of the use of two-dimensional time in the literature can be seen in Sergei Snegov in the book ‚ÄúRing of reverse time‚Äù, the third book of the trilogy ‚ÄúPeople are like gods.‚Äù </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/179247/">https://habr.com/ru/post/179247/</a></p>
