Perhaps that is why it is so funny to listen to official reports of officials and politicians.  Especially annoying advertising promises of colleagues in the shop. <br><br>  That's what I want to talk about: misinformation in web development.  Anyone who has experienced direct sales knows that they often have to keep back, sometimes cunning.  This increases sales efficiency, and, therefore, improves the well-being of the company and the seller himself.  But we must not forget that the site is a service, not a product.  Yes, this is just a program code that runs on a remote server, but you cannot compare the Site software product and a software product, for example, Computer Game.  If a company sold and forgotten a game disc, then the site still needs to be developed, installed, configured, and filled with content.  And you can do it completely differently. <a name="habracut"></a>

      A good and understandable analogy is a massage service.  It can be done in the state clinic, and it will all hurt for another two days.  And you can ¬¨‚Äì in the elite SPA-salon, and you will dream of repeating it for a very long time. <br><br>  Now I don‚Äôt mean that the site is the better, the more expensive, but the fact that the site is first and foremost a service, and not a specific product.  What the sales manager offers - the site - does not exist yet.  How the site will be created is very important, and the customer must clearly understand what will be done and how.  Here you need to be very careful when communicating.  Having misled the client at the briefing or TK approval stage, the customer risks losing him in the process or after completion of the work. <br><br>  <b>1.</b> Developing a corporate resource is only the beginning of a long journey.  Having laid out the site online, the company will not attract new customers and will not increase profits. <br>  <b>2.</b> Promotion in the main issue, translation of contextual advertising or media banners - is not a guarantee of sales.  The product to which the site is dedicated may be inferior in quality or price to similar samples.  Even a very massive advertising campaign can not significantly increase sales of a mediocre product. <br>  <b>3.</b> Technical support web studio can not protect the client site from server problems or from a targeted hacker attack.  In both cases, preventive measures can only minimize losses. <br><br>  All this is known to the professionals of the web industry.  But very rarely this extremely important information comes to the customer ... <br><br>  And how far do you go, telling the future client about what his corporate site will be? <br><br>  ____________________ <br>  On the website of the anniversary, you will find excellent scripts and <a href="http://www.ubilej.ru/pozdravleniya-s-yubileem.html">congratulations on the anniversary</a> for all the anniversary dates. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/78468/">https://habr.com/ru/post/78468/</a></p>
