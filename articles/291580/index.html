To the core.  Since childhood, I loved to read and dreamed of becoming a science fiction writer.  I could spend hours watching what was happening around, whether it was the games of children in the neighboring yard or the crawling of ants along the branches of the vine, not participating in the process, and then inventing on the basis of history observations.  In the gymnasium I was an excellent student in Russian and literature.  I had and have so keenly developed language flair.  It is not surprising that I learned to be a journalist at a university, and before that I worked in circles and went to summer themed camps, participated in various competitions for young people and young people.  Everywhere, where I had to write in Russian, I persistently tried to prove myself and put my talent (?) Into practice.  With 16 years began to publish in the print press, and then "moved" to the Internet, having mastered WordPress, and even php. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  What is it for me?  No, I'm not bragging.  I am amazed.  That when three years ago I began to work actively in the IT sphere, I faced natural discrimination.  Its essence lies in the fact that, as it turned out, all people are divided by profession into two types: techno-gods and, pardon, humanitarian *** and ... Techno-gods are people who have received a technical education.  Let it be a seedy provincial college of computer science, and the person who graduated from it, works as a system administrator for a quarter of the rate for a penny.  He still piously convinced that a priori smarter than me.  Because I am a) a humanist, b) a woman, c) I am not into my own business (men's "computer" topics). <br><br>  I saw, however, and pogromist girls and html-maker-ups.  But they all preferred to remain silent in the company of guru Onotole, conditionally call this caste so, and shyly clap their eyelashes.  And soon I understood why.

      To any question, these techno-logs roll their eyes, sigh heavily and say: ‚ÄúI wouldn‚Äôt have climbed ...‚Äù But I can't do that.  I love and know how to study, and education is impossible without questions and reference not only to the works of theorists, but also to the experience of practitioners.  I want to write well and interestingly about SEO, DDoS, cyberterrorism, web design and much more.  This is really interesting to me, because I am an active Internet user.  And I'm not a rewriter.  It is important for me to do my job well: write.  To write well, you need to understand three things: WHAT I WRITE FOR, WHY AND FOR WHOM.  That's why I stick to techno-gods with idiotic, in their opinion, questions.  I want to get detailed and intelligible answers, and not to read Wikipedia, where I have already been sent repeatedly. <br><br>  I also repeatedly heard that copywriters / authors of content in IT are not needed.  This is an "easy" job that any techie can handle.  After all, the very ‚Äúany techie‚Äù knows the Russian alphabet, which means that he can write any texts on it, checking spelling and punctuation in the Word.  And, apparently, the program will correct his style, the structure of the text, fit it under the canons of a particular genre ... Why, people who know programming languages, with such negligence are great and powerful?  After all, it is no easier, but very much more intricate and more sophisticated than any php ... <br><br>  In addition, techies have already written programs that we, the writers, will replace in the future.  Services that unique texts by synonymization, programs that write original novels ... I read those unique texts, and this is still feces, I apologize for the pun ... Maybe the chaotic confusion of obsolete words, terms and argo, picked up from the dictionary of synonyms randomly, does not confuse Yandex search robots, but from readers such masterpieces should be hidden away, because they look like schizophrenic delusions. <br><br>  Let's try to look at the situation from the other side, roughly speaking, we will switch roles.  What if, receiving an order for ‚Äúarticles for a site,‚Äù I maliciously cleverly responded: ‚ÄúArticles, sir, look in the Dahl dictionary and the criminal code!  And what you want to order is called an advertising description ... Any journalist freshman knows!  Although what can you grovel before, what did you graduate from there, the communication school or whatever is this bursa called ...? ‚ÄùAnd curled lips in a contemptuous half-grin.  Because your ignorance of journalistic terms and unwillingness to google them before you use them in a conversation with a pro, offends me to the depths of the humanities.  Do you know that theorists allocate more than 60 genres of advertising texts?  But there are still pr-texts ... Do not know?  Go google!  And your typos in the TK, the missing commas in the messages in Skype so generally evoke in me a cruel and merciless grammarnatsi. <br><br>  ‚ÄúBeautiful text in the section‚Äú About the company ‚Äù?  Well, vaaaasche-it is called a background grounder .... (sigh) " <br><br>  ‚ÄúI will not write keywords as they are copied from Wordstat!  Pushkin turns over in his grave from these monstrous combinations, but I don‚Äôt want his ghost to come to me at night ... ‚Äù <br><br>  ‚ÄúRoll the text for an hour?  What, I need inspiration, I need to sharpen every phrase, as the waves of the sea grind pebbles for years, because I pretend to Pulitzer for this netenku about electric kettles ... " <br><br>  ‚ÄúIn a quick way to find typos in KP for customers?  I did not study for 5 years as a PR journalist!  Hire a proofreader or open a Russian textbook, I can give a reference! ‚Äù <br><br>  ‚ÄúWhy do people drop the page where they are advertising in Yandex.Direct?  How do I know, I am not an expert on these ads, I work in a different genre, I don‚Äôt know anything about relevance and I don‚Äôt want to know! ‚Äù <br><br>  But I do not say all this.  I do not send people to google, read the wiki, I do not send a picchu "I want to take and donate ..." Because I am a professional.  And for me the main result, and not show off in front of customers / colleagues.  And I do not divide people into techno-gods and humanitarian aid, which have ‚Äúa place at the cash desk in Mac.‚Äù  I divide them into pros and non-pros. And who are you? <br><br><img src="https://scontent-fra3-1.xx.fbcdn.net/hphotos-xtf1/v/t1.0-9/11390283_104815463190661_6702721663012119906_n.jpg?oh=d37652dfd515fec5c9bdb32120b96cc9&amp;oe=55E6FCB5" alt="image"></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/291580/">https://habr.com/ru/post/291580/</a></p>
