In this area, many discoveries have already been made and an incredible amount of amazing developments have been created.  But the most interesting is ahead.  The Internet of things originated and exists thanks to enthusiastic inventors and manufacturers, who produce components from which you can assemble a variety of devices. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/413/683/a98/413683a986e276469db27ea3b01ce61d.jpg" alt="image"></div><br>  Creating complex hardware designs for the Internet of things, many have tried to take advantage of existing server technologies, and, very importantly, cloud services.  However, if you look, for example, at the procedure for sending indicators of a sensor from a board with low power consumption, it becomes obvious that an additional hardware link is needed in the device-server interaction scheme, which ensures reliable and cost-effective communication of IoT devices with the outside world. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Intel is a pioneer in the use of Internet of Things gateway technology.  But what is a "gateway"?  This term is usually used when talking about some kind of equipment that is engaged in the reception, transmission, and often - and data processing.  On the Internet of Things, a gateway is a network equipment that performs many functions, such as combining dozens of sensors or smart devices.  At the same time, the hardware configuration of the gateway can be selected taking into account the task assigned to the project.  As a first approximation, there are Intel Gateways for IoT with processors having from one to four cores.  They are equipped with appropriate amounts of operational and permanent memory.  In addition, these gateways are adapted for a variety of industrial and commercial applications. <br><br>  In order to understand when it is necessary to use the gateway in the development of Internet of things systems, let's talk about the functions and capabilities of gateways.

    <h2>  <font color="#0071c5">Gateway as an aggregator</font> </h2><br>  One of the main benefits of using IoT gateways is the ability to aggregate data from other devices.  Let's face it.  Small form factor devices can solve many problems on their own, but if we load them too much, limitations in the amount of memory and computational power can slow down the entire project, bring it to an almost idle state.  Combining many such devices with the help of a gateway makes it possible to organize an effective collection of their data, allowing them to solve only the tasks for which they are designed. <br><br>  At the same time, it doesn‚Äôt matter what form factors are involved in the project.  The gateway, in any case, can significantly improve performance.  It makes sense to place low-power devices closer to the sensors.  Using the gateway as an aggregator allows you to group a variety of such devices and send their data to the gateway using a specialized network. <br><br>  The use of boards, like Intel Edison, or Intel Galileo, allows you to connect something about a dozen sensors to them.  To interact with all the necessary sensors you may need several such boards.  At the same time, although with their use it is quite possible to organize direct sending of data, say, to the cloud, especially the placement of parts of the system can significantly complicate this task.  If the connection with the individual boards is organized with the help of the gateway, it will allow, for example, to transfer the data collected from them over long distances, which solves problems related to the distance to the sensors and their spatial location.  As a result, it allows you to create solutions that are very difficult or impossible to create without using a gateway. <br><br>  In addition, you can connect sensors to the gateway directly.  Most gateways are capable of operating with about a dozen independent sensors.  Many gateways support several working Wi-Fi networks at once; this allows them to interact with sensors that are able to transmit data over such networks. <br><br>  And finally, you need to pay attention to the data.  Although it is quite possible to send to the server, say, sensor readings as they are read, there are other approaches, the use of which helps protect data, ensure high speed of their transmission and eliminate delays.  The raw data flow from the sensor to the server may seem like a simple and convenient solution, but grouping, batching information, or even assembling disparate indicators into files and sending it to the server in such a way allow for higher quality data transfer. <br><br>  In working with this, there is an opportunity to go even further.  Using the gateway, you can implement various processing options.  At the same time, given that many gateways are equipped with powerful multi-core processors, even quite complex manipulations will not create a load that will slow down the entire system.  As a result, the gateway turns out to be an ideal device for preparing these low-power devices before sending them, for example, to the cloud. <br><br><h2>  <font color="#0071c5">About gateway performance</font> </h2><br>  Intel Gateways for IoT are equipped with Quark, Atom and Core processors.  Intel Quark - single-core processors, their clock frequency is 400 MHz.  Intel Quark and Intel Core processors exist in versions with one, two, or four cores.  Gateways are equipped with data storages and RAM that meet the requirements of the processor and device assignments. <br><br>  Intel Quark-based gateways, for example, based on the Intel Galileo board, are fully capable of satisfying the needs of many developers.  But the commercial sector places higher demands on performance.  Intel's powerful IoT gateways can fit into almost any industrial solution in this area, given that the need for such solutions is constantly growing. <br><br>  In addition, you can use a high level of gateway performance in other ways.  While a lot of end devices are characterized by low power consumption, which is achieved through the use of processors with low clock frequencies, gateways are high-performance devices that can afford to spend more energy on calculations.  The high computing power of gateways allows building real-time systems on their basis.  This is achieved through the use of advanced software, which, of course, relies on the possibility of "hardware".  As a result, IoT systems using gateways can respond as quickly as possible to control actions and to changes in sensor performance.  This is another important advantage of using gateways. <br><br><h2>  <font color="#0071c5">Opportunities to adapt to project needs</font> </h2><br>  Intel Gateways for IoT support many operating systems.  Most models come with Wind River Linux installed.  This, so to speak, is a standard solution.  Some companies offer hardware gateways from Intel, on which Snappy Ubuntu or even Windows 10 is installed. A wide choice of software platforms gives almost unlimited possibilities for software adaptation of gateways to the needs of a specific project. <br><br>  In addition, products for platforms Intel develops many manufacturers.  As a result, if your project needs something completely unique, for example, in a special interface for connecting equipment to the gateway, this is quite possible.  In fact, gateways can be adapted to almost any need, and if you did not find what you need among the standard solutions, you can contact one of our OEMs and discuss the issue of creating a solution specifically for your project. <br><br><h2>  <font color="#0071c5">Networking opportunities</font> </h2><br>  In the area of ‚Äã‚Äãnetwork capabilities, gateways have no equal.  At a minimum, they can connect directly to two local wired networks, they are able to work in single-channel or multichannel Wi-Fi networks.  But that's not all: if necessary, networks based on Bluetooth, ZigBee, 6LoWPAN and others can be organized on the basis of the gateway.  It is easy to understand what opportunities this opens up.  You can learn more about all this on <a href="https://software.intel.com/ru-ru/iot/hardware/gateways">the Intel IoT Gateway technology page</a> . <br><br>  The variety of supported network interfaces allows solutions for the Internet of things that use Intel gateways to include almost any hardware.  This allows systems to connect to cloud services, organize various control schemes.  The list of supported network interfaces includes mobile networks: GPRS, 2G, 3G.  LTE.  In this case, for example, the gateway can simultaneously work in several Wi-Fi networks, and, without interrupting communication, interact with specialized devices using other types of networks.  In situations where other devices may need to disconnect from one network in order to connect to another, Intel gateways keep all channels connected. <br><br>  The power of the network capabilities of gateways is the reason why the aggregation of cost-effective devices, autonomous sensors and other IoT equipment is an important feature of almost all commercial IoT projects. <br><br><h2>  <font color="#0071c5">Security</font> </h2><br>  One of the main reasons for choosing Intel Gateways for IoT is the use of Wind River Linux.  This system is very reliable, but special attention is paid to security.  In particular, thanks to the interaction with McAfee, a platform was created on the basis of Wind River Linux, designed specifically for safe use in the IoT environment. <br><br>  Moreover, it is not only about data protection.  Physical devices are also protected.  In particular, Wind River protects devices from internal or external unauthorized access.  At the same time, in the field of data protection, encryption and secure information exchange with external systems are available here. <br><br><h2>  <font color="#0071c5">Control</font> </h2><br>  Entry-level IoT solutions either support limited management capabilities or do not support them at all.  The situation can be slightly improved through the development of third-party manufacturers, but many find the introduction of such systems, given their limited functionality, unreasonably challenging.  In Intel gateways with Wind River Linux installed, management software is already built into the system.  In addition, support for the Wind River Helix Device Cloud and Wind River Helix App Cloud platforms provide tremendous opportunities for managing devices, applications, and cloud services. <br><br>  At the same time, Wind River Linux allows you to manage not only local, but also remote devices.  They can be controlled either manually or automatically, based on criteria set by administrators and programmers.  In addition, remote devices can be combined into groups and work with them not separately, but based on some common feature, say, on which particular gateway they are connected to. <br><br><h2>  <font color="#0071c5">findings</font> </h2><br>  We looked at the many strengths of Intel Gateways for IoT.  We will now answer questions about when, why, and why to use them.  These questions are both simple and complex.  Here is a small list of situations in which you can recommend the use of Intel gateways for IoT: <br><br><ul><li>  The system being developed seriously depends on performance. </li><li>  Reliable interconnection of components is the key to project success. </li><li>  Inadequate security compromises all work. </li><li>  You need the ability to locally or remotely control the IoT solution. </li><li>  A reliable operating system is needed, on the basis of which you plan to implement your own applications. </li><li>  The success of the project depends on the possibility of creating your own OS build. </li><li>  You need to provide a connection, for example, to the cloud, a huge number of sensors. </li><li>  We need advanced features of the organization of Wi-Fi-networks. </li><li>  The possibility of creating specialized networks for organizing communication with existing equipment. </li></ul><br>  In fact, this is only a small part of the reasons that led, first, to the development of Intel gateways for IoT, and now serve as criteria to be relied upon when deciding whether to include a gateway in your project.  In countless cases, the creators of IoT-systems should use the products of the industrial class, not being distracted by the development, designed for amateurs.  With their help, you can assemble a working prototype, a small home project, but when it comes to commercial use, when security and the ability to scale come to the fore, reliable industrial-level systems cannot do.  In this situation, solutions based on Intel IoT Gateway technology are one of the very few alternatives available on the market today.  These solutions are ideal for the development and implementation of projects of any complexity. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/302824/">https://habr.com/ru/post/302824/</a></p>
