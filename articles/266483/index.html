Read in the news of the week for a mobile developer</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/e77/ec0/c86/e77ec0c86bef4d31b4df09a299b5f81a.png"><br><br><h3>  <b>What really attracts users?</b> </h3><br>  The development of the mobile market is in full swing.  In an ever-growing competition, attracting a user is becoming more and more difficult.  Researcher from Venture Beat, John Koetsier (John Koetsier) presented a <a href="http://insight.venturebeat.com/report/mobile-user-acquisition-how-top-publishers-get-best-users-less-money%3Futm_source%3Dvb%26utm_medium%3Drefer%26utm_content%3Deditorial-post%26utm_campaign%3Duser-acquisition-aug">report</a> that compiled a rating of channels to attract users. <br><br>  In attracting users, social networks are still the most important channel.  Although this is the most popular type of promotion, it is noticeable from the diagram that marketers use far from only this channel. 
      <br>
        <script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>
        <ins class="adsbygoogle"
          style="display:block; text-align:center;"
          data-ad-layout="in-article"
          data-ad-format="fluid"
          data-ad-client="ca-pub-6974184241884155"
          data-ad-slot="8945601208"></ins>
        <script>
          (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
        </script>
      <br>
      In the presented diagram, almost half of the attraction strategies are channels that do not require advertising (PR, e-mail, motivated traffic).  It is important to remember that the fact that these channels do not contain an advertising budget does not mean that they are free. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br><h3>  <b>Millionth sales need to wait six months</b> </h3><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/9ff/67e/d0b/9ff67ed0bf6c4d0d98b96a6d5b6a79b0.jpg"><br>  This is the conclusion reached by analytical company App Annie.  Based on the data obtained over 5 years of research (from 2011 to 2015) of successful mobile projects, analysts concluded that in what time period the applications reach the first million dollars in revenue and the first million downloads.  The full version of the report can be viewed at the <a href="http://blog.appannie.com/stayin-alive-games-that-last-charts/">link</a> , and below we present some interesting facts. <br><br><br><ul><li>  Thirty-three percent of iOS apps of one million people achieved such an audience in the first month after release.  Half a dozen million people had to wait about a year. </li><li>  1 million 50% of applications have been waiting for 3 months on Google Play; </li><li>  on both platforms, $ 10 million in revenue can be obtained on average 6 months. </li><li>  80% of applications get 95% of all their profits in more than a year. </li></ul><br><br><h3>  <b>Glu talked about their whales</b> </h3><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/2c8/eb2/77c/2c8eb277c01a4b688725a9704ac32956.jpg"><br><br>  It's no secret that the notorious Pareto law is also reflected in the mobile gaming industry: less than 20% of paying users generate more than 80% of the profits.  In the case of games, things are much more critical: from 5% to 10% of players usually pay, and only a small part of them are superpaying or ‚Äúwhales‚Äù.  About how much the Glu company depends on its ‚Äúwhales‚Äù was <a href="http://www.pocketgamer.biz/comment-and-opinion/61879/niccolo-de-masi-on-whale-behavior/">told</a> by Niccolo de Masi, CEO. <br><br>  Embedded purchases are still the most popular monetization method for Glu - the company earned 82% of the profits in the last quarter.  In the company's main project, Kim Kardashian: Hollywood, the top players leave $ 1,446 for the game on Android and $ 1,252 on iOS.  Superpaying players continue to use the game for an average of 100 days, 5-6 times a day, spending about 8 minutes in the game. <br><br>  Summarizing, de Macy adds that the Glu approach is based on providing a positive gaming experience to all categories of players, regardless of the status of their payments. <br><br><br><h3>  <b>Are ‚Äúscreaming‚Äù icons more effective?</b> </h3><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/6bb/b7f/882/6bbb7f882cff4b75a7de18c2a859ad00.jpg"><br><br>  It turns out that some of the popular games have on the icons <a href="http://www.pocketgamer.biz/news/61813/action-mouth-icon/">faces with open</a> mouth, screaming, or smiling.  Such a discovery analytics from the agency ironSource. <br><br>  And now the jokes aside, the reasons for this can be completely different, from the ‚ÄúCargo cult‚Äù - the meaningless copying of random fluctuations, to the fundamental foundations of the psyche, greater confidence in a smiling person or more emotions from people in a rage.  Perhaps there is something in this and it is worth using and even digging deeper. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/266483/">https://habr.com/ru/post/266483/</a></p>
