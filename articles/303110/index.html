But, being in the center of Barcelona, ‚Äã‚ÄãI did not feel the peculiarities of the moment.  Everything happened consistently and even logical.  My path, which began in a small village, continued in an unexpected way for many in the capital.  And all because I was not afraid to dream. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Successful graduation and exams allowed me to enter a good university.  Programming was surprisingly easy.  Each profile exam ended with an excellent grade.  The teachers were pleased, but I began to doubt. <br><br>  The dreams I dreamed of as a child disappeared.  I stopped thinking about traveling the world and, instead, filled out a resume and chose the future for the highest salary.  Having embarked on the "correct" path, I got into the system with my own rules and with my ceiling.  I realized that I was going the wrong way and did not want to be in that place.

      As they grow up, they say to us: ‚Äústop dreaming and live in the real world‚Äù.  But the fact is that reality is not what surrounds us.  The reality we create for ourselves.  Thinking, actions and ideas affect the perception of the world.  The world is much more flexible than it seems.  It has everything you need.  We can only take it. <br><br>  <i>‚ÄúYou believed that you could do anything and anywhere and become what you want when you grow up.</i>  <i>And then we learned that all this is prohibited.</i>  <i>You were told that you need to grow and stop dreaming that you should behave intelligently and not set too high goals for yourself ‚Äù- from the book‚Äú Be the Better Version of Yourself ‚Äù.</i> <br><br>  It all started with a dream to find a job as a programmer.  I was 18. Then I realized that tomorrow's success is the result of today's efforts and used three summer months to develop skills and reached the goal in winter.  I was not too smart.  I just wanted and took it. <br><br>  Every morning we are given a chance to become better and it would be foolish to miss it.  Many people dream all their lives about things that are achieved by simple discipline.  What are you dreaming about?  Perhaps you need to do just one step. <br><br>  <i>‚ÄúAnxiety and doubts are overcome only by action, and the missed chance will remind of itself all its life‚Äù - from the article ‚ÄúThe moments due to which you live‚Äù.</i> <br><br>  Dream it.  The higher your bar, the higher you will be. <br><br>  You should be able to dream.  Many things about happiness are imposed on us.  After all, it is very difficult to find true desires when it is easier to take someone else's.  I also did this, and still can not catch myself on the fact that some things that previously seemed desirable, have become uninteresting.  But those goals that have long been present in my life, I value every day more and more, because they are the real desires. <br><br>  To wake up and realize that this is how you would like to live this day is priceless.  Our life becomes shorter every minute, and isn't it given to us for happiness? <br><br>  Dreaming, do not forget to live in the present.  After all, John Lennon was not mistaken when he said that life is what happens to you when you make plans for the future. <br><br>  After all, dreams are not goals, but rather reference points.  If everything went according to plan, it would be unbearably boring to live. <br><br>  Your life is only a moment.  And only you can do it better.  So, moment by moment, your life will make sense on the path to a dream. <br><br>  If you do everything right, then at some point you will realize that dreams have come true, and every day brings joy.  How to do the right thing?  Make a decision by listening to two voices: logic and intuition.  Doubts arise at the moment of their disagreement with each other, but when they say something in unison, you should know that this is what you need. <br><br>  Dream, live and be yourself. <br><br>  Everything is possible. <br><br>  Know that your future is determined by the moments when it is hard for you.  Life will throw up obstacles to check how much you are willing to master what you want.  She is ready to give you everything you need.  Are you ready to take it?  If so, go and take it. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/303110/">https://habr.com/ru/post/303110/</a></p>
