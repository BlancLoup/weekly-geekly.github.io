      But somewhere in the middle, like the truth, there is something amazing - the Usability of Advertising. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  <b>From website usability to advertising usability</b> <br><br>  There is a direct relationship between the convenience of the site itself (i.e. its usability) and the revenue from the site - a convenient site is more popular among visitors.  They come and stay.  They come back and advise him to friends.  Visitors - this is essentially the profit of the site. <br><br>  And if the advertisement, with the help of which the site earns, make it convenient and noticeable for the visitor? <br>  And if at all everything with the help of what the site earns (paid subscription, the process of buying in the online store, etc.) - to subordinate to the principles of usability? <br><br>  The answer is obvious - income will grow. <br><br>  <b>So what is usable advertising?</b> <br><br>  The nature of the user's behavior on the Internet is to find the right information.  Accordingly, advertising on the site can be effective when it helps the user to find what he needs. <br><br>  Remember your attitude to advertising on the site - after all, you will not be lured by a bright appeal and you will not be able to trick the advertising block in place of the menu.  Now forget that users are dumber than you and think. <br><br>  If the advertisement interferes too much with the user (pop-ups, blinking banners), then he gets annoyed and leaves the site.  If the advertisement is "masked" and misleading, the user will get used to the minefield, or (most likely) will leave again. <br><br>  Therefore (looking ahead), experts consider effective blocks of contextual advertising, unobtrusively inscribed in the design and style of the site, located, as it were, in addition to the text, and especially with regard to behavioral targeting. <br><br>  Users like ads that: <br><ul><li>  understandable, i.e.  you can predict what will happen after clicking on it; </li><li>  correlated with the theme of the site or with the interest of a particular visitor; </li><li>  blends harmoniously with the site itself; </li></ul><br><br>  <b>6 steps to make advertising on the site more efficient:</b> <br><br>  <i>1. Change your attitude to advertising</i> <br><br>  Advertising is not useless information to the user.  It is more than just money.  Try to treat advertising as something that helps the user to find the right information, the right product. <br>  From this perspective, it is obvious that advertising should complement the content of the site, it can and should be useful.  Exclude all advertising systems on your site that prevent the user from finding the right information.  And add those ad formats that really help visitors: contextual advertising, behavioral advertising, advertising on a given topic, etc. <br><br>  <i>2. Advertising should be noticeable, but unobtrusive.</i> <br><br>  Remember, advertising is what helps the audience of the site.  Make this information more accessible and visible.  Of course, for each site and even for each page, the most effective placements may be different.  Consider the behavior of your visitors on different pages and imagine where it would be most effective to draw their attention to advertising. <br><br>  In usability, the most attractive places for visitors are known.  The general principle is that advertising should be placed near the content for which the user comes, the closer the advertisement to the content is, the more noticeable it is.  The less between advertising and content of unnecessary elements, for example: stripes, icons, ryushechek, etc., the better. <br><br>  In general terms, the most attractive places are shown in the diagram (marked in yellow): <br><br><img src="http://forum.profit-partner.ru/ftp/321.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  <i>3. Use advanced statistics.</i> <br><br>  Many systems offer slices to track ad performance.  Place cuts and find out which ad units are effective and in which places they are best placed.  Also, you can use the heat map of clicks and services for visual testing of the site to understand which places on the site are most noticeable to its visitor. <br><br>  <i>4. Make advertising a continuation and addition to the main content.</i> <br><br>  Create an appropriate design.  In particular, change colors and fonts.  When designing ads, it is recommended to use colors that are already used in the design of the site, for example, in navigation or design elements. <br><br>  If ads are embedded in text placed on a light background, it is recommended to use the same color scheme for ads.  For example, the text is dark blue on a white background - respectively, the ads should be arranged in approximately the same colors - dark blue font and white or light background. <br><br>  <i>5. Check if advertising is available everywhere?</i> <br><br>  Check for advertising in various sections of the site.  For example, if there is a forum - place blocks of advertising there.  First of all, advertising should be placed on the ‚Äúend pages‚Äù - that is, where visitors are delayed.  For example, on pages with news, a large number of text content, in articles, etc. <br><br>  <i>6. Use the opinions of professionals.</i> <br><br>  You can always listen to expert opinion, for example, contact our <a href="http://profit-partner.ru/tools/conslist/">consultant to increase income</a> .  He will describe in detail all the features of your site, and help to increase advertising revenue Yandex.Direct. <br><br>  Today, many advertising formats that do not annoy the user, but rather help the webmaster to earn money, and the visitor finds the right information. <br><br>  Tell me, what advertising formats do you use on your sites? </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/99719/">https://habr.com/ru/post/99719/</a></p>
