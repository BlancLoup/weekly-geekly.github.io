This year, the project officially changed the site, moving to a more convenient and popular platform <a href="http://lumiabetaapps.uservoice.com/">UserVoice</a> . <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/bb9/b97/8e6/bb9b978e6e3046e5872bd5e5ce307ac8.png"><br><br>  The latest innovations of the project are the new <a href="https://www.windowsphone.com/ru-ru/store/app/gestures-beta/38384829-0b39-4f21-a954-d2d4f8a4ac96">Gestures</a> application (it is likely that it will be called Gestures on the Russian market) and the additional functions <a href="https://www.windowsphone.com/ru-ru/store/app/%25D0%25B7%25D0%25B0%25D1%2581%25D1%2582%25D0%25B0%25D0%25B2%25D0%25BA%25D0%25B0/106e0a97-8b19-42cf-8879-a8ed2598fcbb">Glance Screen</a> (we simply call it Screensaver). <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h4>  <a href="https://www.windowsphone.com/ru-ru/store/app/gestures-beta/38384829-0b39-4f21-a954-d2d4f8a4ac96">Gestures beta</a> </h4><br>  As you can guess from the name, the application allows you to control the functions of the smartphone using simple gestures or movements.  And yes, you correctly understood that by this there is no need to perform any actions on the touchscreen of a smartphone.

      The principle of the application is tied to the work of several sensors: an accelerometer (determining the change in the position of the phone), as well as a proximity sensor. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/9YGvfLjje_s%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700022,15700186,15700191,15700248,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhj3kXVXVUgZ3TO-Ek3ETGeN8f6TCw" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  At the moment, the list of available commands is limited to actions related to accepting calls or switching the talk mode and looks like this: <br><ul><li>  receiving incoming calls: in order to take a call you just need to bring the phone to your ear; </li><li>  microphone mute: it‚Äôs enough to put the phone screen down on a relatively flat surface; </li><li>  turning on the speakerphone: everything is the same as in the previous paragraph, but the screen is up; </li><li>  mute the call when an incoming call: use the now traditional reception with a simple turn of the smartphone face down. </li></ul><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/225/df2/817/225df28173334d5aa0ec512b2ab21325.png"><br><br>  The application has a simple settings panel in which the user can turn off this or that function at his discretion. <br><br>  We anticipate your silent exclamation ‚ÄúThis has already happened (in The Simpsons)!‚Äù: Yes, similar functions have sometimes been found on other platforms and devices.  But, first, this is the debut of a similar control on Windows Phone.  And, secondly, do not forget that Gestures is a Beta Labs project, so you can count on the fact that over time it will receive new features, allowing you to control other functions with gestures and maybe even other applications. <br><br><h5>  ‚Äú <i>Our goal in the long term is to create a larger set of controlled gestures for connecting various functions without touching the screen or pressing buttons.</i>  <i>We want to simplify your interaction with the phone,</i> ‚Äùconfirms our words Martin Jansky, senior product promotion manager.  - ‚Äú <i>When developing new features for our application that will appear next year, we would be happy to hear feedback from users.</i>  <i>They will help us understand how to make this technology more reliable before we install it on all devices</i> x. ‚Äù </h5><br><br>  You can also contribute to the improvement of Gestures by leaving your feedback and suggestions <a href="https://lumiabetaapps.uservoice.com/forums/268217-lumia-gestures-beta">on this link</a> .  As practice shows, almost all user suggestions for other projects that have scored a greater number of votes have been implemented by developers. <br><br>  On behalf of the editors of our cozy blog, we suggest that the Gestures application will go into the pool of pre-installed with the next update of Windows Phone 8.1 or after the release of Windows 10 (which, as you can remember, will replace Windows Phone). <br><br>  And about device support: the beta version of the Gestures application is compatible with all devices based on Windows Phone 8.1 (such as, for example, Lumia 535, Lumia 830 and Lumia 730/735).  On the Lumia 630, Lumia 635 and Lumia 530 functionality will be limited.  We edited Gestures on several devices - in general, everything works stably, but something may not work the first time. <br><br>  Download the application can be <a href="https://www.windowsphone.com/ru-ru/store/app/gestures-beta/38384829-0b39-4f21-a954-d2d4f8a4ac96">on this link</a> . <br><br><h4>  <a href="https://www.windowsphone.com/ru-ru/store/app/%25D0%25B7%25D0%25B0%25D1%2581%25D1%2582%25D0%25B0%25D0%25B2%25D0%25BA%25D0%25B0/106e0a97-8b19-42cf-8879-a8ed2598fcbb">Updated "Screensaver"</a> </h4><br>  In the application "Screensaver" or Glance Screen there are new options that significantly expand the capabilities of the application.  For those who have forgotten what this app is, we recall: Glance Screen is a screensaver displayed on the screen of a locked smartphone (depending on the selected mode, it can work continuously or be displayed only when the user's hand moves).  It works in low-power mode and informs the user about the current time, battery charge and other events chosen by the user, such as a calendar, missed calls, incoming SMS, notifications from social networks and so on. <br><br>  In the update (version 3.6.1.13), it became possible to display photographs and graphic images on this screen, which expands the possibilities of individualization.  This option has already been appreciated by more than half a million users who have tested the beta version of this application.  But this is not the most important thing. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/c96/f48/5d6/c96f485d6acb470daab2fda47a976ad6.jpg"><br><br>  Most importantly, in our opinion, the ‚ÄúScreensaver‚Äù has learned to interact with other applications, displaying other useful information.  So, for example, <a href="https://www.windowsphone.com/ru-ru/store/app/%25D0%25BF%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B3%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B4%25D0%25B0/63c2a117-8604-44e7-8cef-df10be3a57c8">MSN Weather</a> became one of the first app that made friends with the Glance Screen.  Now, when you turn on the display of weather data <a href="https://www.windowsphone.com/ru-ru/how-to/wp8/settings-and-personalization/personalize-my-lock-screen">on the lock screen</a> , this information can be duplicated on the screen of the locked smartphone. <br><br>  Such a solution, in our opinion, is convenient and energy efficient, and most importantly - expands the boundaries for developers of other applications.  Imagine if, for example, Habrahabr tape, Geektimes, Twitter, To-Do lists, news or other useful information was automatically broadcast on the screen and at the same time practically did not eat up the charge of your smartphone.  Sounds good, isn't it? <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/a26/f0e/bd0/a26f0ebd0a734996acdff567505bc18c.png"><br><br>  And about the vital: this function will be available on Lumia devices, the display resolution of which is not lower than 720p.  Today it is the Lumia 1520, Lumia 1320, Lumia 1020, Lumia 925, Lumia 920 and Lumia 830. Although the Lumia 930 has a suitable screen, it doesn‚Äôt support Glance Screen technology due to the technical features of the graphics adapter. <br><br>  Download the application can be <a href="https://www.windowsphone.com/ru-ru/store/app/%25D0%25B7%25D0%25B0%25D1%2581%25D1%2582%25D0%25B0%25D0%25B2%25D0%25BA%25D0%25B0/106e0a97-8b19-42cf-8879-a8ed2598fcbb">on this link.</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/364893/">https://habr.com/ru/post/364893/</a></p>
