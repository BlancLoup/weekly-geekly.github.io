And here, <a href="http://blogs.sun.com/hinkmond/entry/java_me_says_hello_world">on April 10, there is news.</a>  .  ‚ÄúOh, tse dilo‚Äù, my cosmopolitan brain immediately inflamed, and I decided to wait for the appearance of Christ to the people.  I must say, comments <br>  For <i>iPhone SDK, it doesn‚Äôt make it possible to read or understand the iPhone.</i> <i><br></i>  <i>See section 3.3.2 of the iphone SDK agreement.</i> <i><br></i>  <i>It doesn‚Äôt seem to be anything like the JavaME, Flash, or scripting.</i>  " <br>  put me on my guard.  I wrote a fun timekeeping with other people's pictures. <br><img src="http://blogs.sun.com/hinkmond/resource/images-2008/google-comic-01.JPG"><br>  PS <br>  At the end of the article you will find a link to a ridiculous parody of Google comic book advertising.

Everyone understands that this is similar to sex in a hammock with the use of an astronaut spacesuit.  I want more. <br><img src="http://blogs.sun.com/hinkmond/resource/images/iphone-java-me.JPG"><br><br>  <a href="http://blogs.sun.com/hinkmond/entry/houston_we_have_liftoff">On April 17, Dzhavushka is allowed on Aitache</a> . <br><img src="http://blogs.sun.com/hinkmond/resource/images-2008/java-me-for-iphone.jpg"><br>  I am still burning and looking forward to: when, when can I start my pens in the iPhone?

      <a href="http://blogs.sun.com/hinkmond/entry/perhaps_java_me_technology_can">From April 18, the brave dignitary Hinkmond begins to noticeably nervous</a> .  Once again I am convinced: if you are a programmer, then sit and program.  Maybe Hinkmond are very cool people, but I think that Steven Jobs knows better how to sell his product. <br><br>  <a href="http://blogs.sun.com/hinkmond/entry/flash_lite_and_java_me">On April 30, it becomes clear that Comrade Hinkmond is a real fanatic</a> .  Poor fellow, he probably read The <a href="http://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%259C%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BB%25D0%25BE%25D1%2582_%25D0%25B2%25D0%25B5%25D0%25B4%25D1%258C%25D0%25BC">Witch Hammer</a> as a child.  Saying "The Bes-Alliances" <a href="http://www.theinquirer.net/gb/inquirer/news/2008/04/30/sony-ericsson-merges-flash-java">between Flash Light and Java IU</a> worthy of applause.  I still have the SE w950i.  Despite the frank dampness, the SE w950i was a real breakthrough in its time.  Unfortunately, I then pretended to write on PCP, so my little hands did not reach the SDK to SE. <br>  By the way, about Clintonshi and Obama, he was wrong.  They very nicely made friends, and the lady gave way to the "African American."  How sweet of her.  If Hinkmond will continue in the same spirit, Adobe with his lightweight Flash will ditch Java IU. <br><br>  Despite the fact that the month is June, <a href="http://blogs.sun.com/hinkmond/entry/oh_hoppy_day_an_anti">Hinkmond aggravates</a> .  I started to worry about him.  Well, you can not be so nervous.  Well, yes, Dzhava Epplu did not get fucked on his iPhone, so the man wound up from the fact that it will be supported on the "anti-iPhone".  You can go to the manufacturer's website and look at this <a href="http://hop-on.com/hop1801.html">miracle</a> . <br>  Here is a picture, if you are too lazy to press a link. <br><img src="http://hop-on.com/images/gsm-hop1801.jpg"><br><br>  The guy did not calm down.  He can not recover from that.  that <a href="http://blogs.sun.com/hinkmond/entry/iphones_games_will_cost_more">some games on the iPhone will cost as much as 17-18 euros</a> .  Our foreign humanist ecologist tries to compare the cost of a game for an iPhone, first with four gallons of gas, and then playing on Java ME with a happy mil, and then with a happy mil toy.  I have nothing against comparing games on Java ME with a happy mil, but I don‚Äôt see a connection between gas fuel for a car and games for iPhone. <br>  <i>Sheesh.</i>  <i>What does it take to make iPhone games?</i>  <i>A barrel of crude oil?</i>  <i>:-)</i> - this phrase for the demonstration in the heading under the name ‚Äúwithout comments‚Äù. <br><br>  But no, that you, Hinkmond tireless.  Having cooled down a bit to Java IU on iPhone, he breaks off <a href="http://blogs.sun.com/hinkmond/entry/java_me_technology_entrenched_for">another gem</a> .  His strange conclusions are supported by commentators.  Of course, .NET on the mobile platform is something with something.  And the statement about Google Androyd is controversial.  Considering that the prizes for the best applications for Androyd were distributed relatively recently, the Google project is still ahead, but Java ME should move.  San gradually loses sense of reality.  Look, they didn‚Äôt let iPhones on iPhone, but Flash Light is gradually sticking to it on mobile phones.  Slowly, but, as we remember, Moscow was also not immediately built.  And when Androyd gains strength, he will cool players on mobile platforms.  Despite the fact that Androyd is in essence - Java, do not forget what to look like Java and to be Java IU are two different things. <br>  We can say that the main ground of Java, this is the web and business applications.  Applets have never been reincarnated, although JavaFX will play the role of a beautiful prince kissing a beautiful princess (i.e., Javian applets).  San still holds the mobile phone market well, but in the light of recent events, one shouldn‚Äôt be optimistic, we must soberly assess the situation. <br><br>  Despite all the posts of the author, he has a <a href="http://blogs.sun.com/hinkmond/entry/mobile_phone_can_be_used">good sense of humor</a> .  We are talking about another Chinese priblude. <br><img src="http://blogs.sun.com/hinkmond/resource/images-2008/iphone-clone-projector.jpg"><br>  "(NOTE: In the photo, the Epoq has a screen for your screen! Lordy! Can you say," Copyright infringement? "Oh yeah, Epoq to normal again. :-)) " <br>  And what a good shake.  I give him credit. <br><br>  And finally, a masterpiece: <a href="http://blogs.sun.com/hinkmond/entry/iphone_is_like_guess_jeans">"IPhone, it's like jeans Hess in the 80s</a> . <a href="http://blogs.sun.com/hinkmond/entry/iphone_is_like_guess_jeans">"</a> <br><br>  My iPhone yesterday morning hit his head on the bath, and then drowned.  Honestly, I did not feel any discomfort because I took out the good old SonyEricsson w950i and went to work.  Hinkmond's attacks on Apple are completely unfounded.  In the words of the bulgger, one feels resentment and annoyance at the fact that he, including San <i>(light irony)</i> , was not allowed to go to the feast of life, arranged by Jobs.  To say that Aifonomania is nonsense and a bad thing, it‚Äôs all the same what to call Google an evil empire.  Buy used Siemens phones and use gogo.ru to search, since you are fighting evil. <br>  If someone makes good and beautiful things, why not buy them?  If someone writes good programs, why not use them? <br><br>  The iPhone is another success story, and no matter how much the competitors envy their saliva, success is undeniable.  I do not mind that there is no Java IU on iPhone.  I'm waiting for Androyd on HTC.  I hope they will be fine with love. <br><br>  Promised link to a funny comic about Google and its browser. <br>  <a href="http://www.portfolio.com/interactive-features/2008/09/Google-Comic">http://www.portfolio.com/interactive-features/2008/09/Google-Comic</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/39007/">https://habr.com/ru/post/39007/</a></p>
