Naturally, all of the following reflects my personal opinion and may not coincide with the generally accepted one. <br><br>  So: <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><ol><li>  Never monitor the resources where you left the announcement of finding a new employee. <br>  Indeed, why?  Let him make his own way from, for example, hh.ru to the hidden and unrecoverable page "vacancy" on the company's website.  And if the vacancy is no longer valid - do not rush to shoot an ad. </li><li>  Never reply immediately after receiving a response!  Let the applicant understand the importance of your work, let him suffer, have noticed his resume or not.  You're so busy that you do not want to break away from your favorite social networks for the sake of not understand who. </li><li>  If you already answered, do not immediately tell who exactly you need - let the fog and significance! </li><li>  If the applicant does not want to run away from you - give him a test task, which will take a long time to complete!  Moreover, give the assignment even if the candidate is already defined, what if something interesting is written? </li><li>  Asks clarifying questions?  It will cost!  Let him do as it is written in the assignment! </li><li>  Sent a completed task?  Do not rush to acknowledge receipt (see p.2) </li><li>  Delay consideration of the job for a couple of days, you never know ... </li><li>  If everything is already clear with the candidate - do not rush to tell him about it!  And if your decision is a failure, you can not write at all, you will think that a lump is not large - it will cost. </li><li>  Did you decide to write about the impossibility of cooperation?  Try to do it in the most official manner - let them know their place. </li><li>  Did you write a review about your ‚Äúwork‚Äù on a famous resource?  In the black list of this!  Look, he doesn't like it. </li></ol>

      Dear HRs, by following these simple recommendations, you will forever conquer disgust in the hearts of applicants, and they certainly will never recommend anyone to go to your company and you will not have to perform as many unnecessary gestures.  Also, they will not recommend and make orders in your company - you will render service to your colleagues.  Of course, supplement this list with your own work. <br><br>  And now a little more serious.  Do you think all these recommendations are so obvious?  Alas, it turned out not at all.  I recently talked to the employees of the Minsk branch of Yandex and had the impression that many of these councils have long been known and successfully used in practice.  I do not see much sense in telling a story or calling names - if they read, I hope it will become a little embarrassing and in the future they will be more professional in their duties. <br><br>  And so as not to end on a sad note - fortunately, there are wonderful companies that employ exceptional HRs who have the time to respond promptly and correctly to all letters / questions with which it is pleasant to communicate both on business and just like that. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/286724/">https://habr.com/ru/post/286724/</a></p>
