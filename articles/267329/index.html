Studying the <a href="https://github.com/master255/ImmortalPlayer">code of my program</a> , I came to the conclusion that it does not just have software options, but whole technologies.  Such technologies that are not available anywhere else.  One of these technologies is called DoubleDomain.  I will tell about it in more detail ... <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  <i>Epigraph:</i> <br><blockquote>  <i>I love to invent freedom.</i>  <i>I write programs that help to become more free.</i>  <i>Everyone says to me, ‚ÄúOleg - you can't earn money with this!‚Äù.</i>  <i>‚ÄúYes, I know,‚Äù I reply to them.</i>  <i>But why do I need money if I have freedom?)).</i> </blockquote><br>  Data transfer technologies have many more gaps that we have to open.  There are not many people in the world doing this.  Basically everyone is satisfied with what is now.  Therefore, there is no need to invent something new.  It is because of this need that I found one of the spaces. <br>  I understand that the unblocking of sites from Roskomnadzor is not so relevant today.  For example, in Opera, the Opera Turbo tick not only speeds up the opening of sites, but also unlocks most of them.  But Doubledomain technology is much more than it seems at first glance.  The essence of technology: <br><blockquote>  DoubleDomain - domain double.  To ensure uninterrupted access to the site, a second, duplicate domain is used. <br>  The principle of operation - in the absence of access to site A, access to site B is provided. The list of correspondence of sites is indicated in the program itself or on a special site.  This technology is transparent to the user and it always seems to him that site A. is open. </blockquote><br>  According to today's version, the transition to site B is performed in case of a site access error or redirect 301, 302, 303, 307. When site A is registered, the whois is checked.  If the site does not exist, then the registration of site A occurs without verifying the owner.  If site A exists, then the owner of the site is checked by sending a random file with random content to the root of the checked site A. <br>  Such technology gives multidimensionality to our Internet.  And this dramatically changes the game in some situations.  In order to better understand exactly how, let's consider examples of usage: <br><br>  1) Fault tolerance.  There is always a chance that the domain will suddenly stop working.  The reliability of the domain depends on a lot of factors.  Domains are blocked by mistake, domain resellers lose connections with registrars along with domains, domains forget to pay, the domain may not be properly sent, etc. ... Using DoubleDomain technology, all these problems disappear.  Website B opens. It looks like magic).

      2) Your site is <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/DoS-%25D0%25B0%25D1%2582%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BA%25D0%25B0">dear</a> .  Option 1 - well, let site A. deserve all the same. Site B will open anyway. It is even possible to disable site A. <br>  Option 2 - site A and B are off. Turning site A off and changing site B. Of course, hackers are not stupid either and will write a program that will access the DoubleDomain service via API and will automatically receive site B, but this will make it much more difficult for them. <br><br>  3) Roscom blocked your site.  It does not matter.  No more need for proxying traffic.  Go to the no-ip service (any).  Register any domain.  We go to the website of the DoubleDomain service and register the correspondence: site A is a blocked site, site B is a no-ip site.  Everything.  When redirecting or blocking your blocked site A, the no-ip site will open and the user will see the same site A in the url of the page. But Roscom does not have a simple company.  They can also block ip.  Then you need a dynamic white ip address.  No-ip sync with white ip occurs in the shortest, customizable time frame.  The No-ip site will redirect the domain to a new ip address and it will appear in the browser as Site A. The DoubleIp technology would not hurt, but I think it is impossible))).  Of course, Roscom will block again and again, but you will not block everything from the ip of the address, and the domain names no-ip are infinity. <br><br>  4) For example, there is not a purchased and not directed domain name.  You go to the DoubleDomain service site.  Register site A - like this non-working domain, and on site B - write your site.  The magic is not capable of this, and the new technology will open your site B to users of the DoubleDomain extension as if it is site A. And it will open until the owner of site A declares and does not present the right to the site or directs his site to hosting.  Something like this. <br><br>  5) Faster DNS name update.  Strongly dependent on implementation.  But now I have plans to download a file of matches when I first start the browser and at least by clicking on the ‚Äúupdate sites‚Äù button, by the user.  Creating a request to the service API every time a request is received with a redirect or an error, will now give an inappropriate load to the browser.  Although, as an option and it can be used.  Then the DNS update will occur instantly. <br><br>  Of course, I could not write this article, but navigate my DoubleDomain service and collect money for registering in it.  But the principle of work is too simple to keep it secret.  Yes, and the implementation of such a service in a basic form is possible, even for a schoolboy.  I will continue to promote my DoubleDomain service and will only be happy to see competitors. <br><br>  The main problem in creating such a technology is the audience, which is not a big problem in the case of a separate, private service.  After all, you can always advise users to install a browser extension for uninterrupted access to the site.  Or sew it up by default in the client program. <br>  Of course, the most beautiful thing is that this technology would look directly embedded in the browser.  I hope the developers will hear me and understand that the user should always have site B in front of the error screen.  How to implement this is a technical issue, not a logical one.  I think this is the essence of discovery.  Technologies are developing, power is growing, you just need to notice that you can get a new one using the power level higher. <br><br>  My implementation: <br>  <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/doubledomain/hijagkcphgfnecacnfpajoemebifpnhn">chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/doubledomain/hijagkcphgfnecacnfpajoemebifpnhn</a> <br>  I did not know anything about writing extensions when I started writing it.  I hope for the emergence of better implementations.  This expansion will gradually evolve.  If now is just an example, then soon it will be quite a working version with a site to add its own correspondences. <br><br>  In the example there is a link to the casino.  The casino is of course fake.  I used it because this site is blocked in Russia. <br><br>  <b>Upd: Vast discussions erupted over the article.</b>  <b>I gave answers to them day and night.</b>  <b>More than 1100 comments have accumulated. Everyone was interested in the details of the technology, as it turned out to be too simple and at the same time radical.</b>  <b>Therefore, I tried to structure the discussions in order to restore order and come to the logical end of the discussions.</b> <b><br></b>  <b>For clarity, I brought the discussion in the discussion branches of the examples given in the article:</b> <b><br></b>  <b><a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/267329/">Example 1 - Failover;</a></b> <b><br></b>  <b><a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/267329/">Example 2 - potential protection against DDos attacks;</a></b> <b><br></b>  <b><a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/267329/">Example 3 - protection against blocking sites;</a></b> <b><br></b>  <b><a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/267329/">Example 4 - the use of not purchased domains for free;</a></b> <b><br></b>  <b><a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/267329/">Example 5 - Instant DNS Name Update.</a></b> <b><br></b>  <b>There are many more examples of use and you can create them yourself.</b> <b><br><br></b>  <b>Regarding the discussions, I realized one thing - even a point on a piece of paper can be discussed for years, but not necessary.</b>  <b>The commentators still have questions, but due to the fact that they did not like my answers and they themselves lowered my karma, I cannot answer them.</b> <b><br></b>  <b>I consider 1,100 comments more than enough to ask and answer all the major questions on the new technology.</b> <b><br><br></b> <h4>  The result of the discussions is a new technology with no flaws.  Use! </h4><br><br>  Upd2: The technology is quite simple to implement, but I recently got a job as a chief developer and now all my time is occupied by other projects.  Since the technology is global and affects the transfer of data throughout the world, it is possible with enthusiasts to create a whole organization to promote this and other related technologies. <br>  Contact me by email masters@inbox.ru </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/267329/">https://habr.com/ru/post/267329/</a></p>
