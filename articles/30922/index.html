  <section class="page js-page"><h1>When programs are written not by programmers</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  I love listening to stories about non-programmers who write programs.  Something in them warms my soul. <br><br>  After practicing yoga, sitting in a sushi bar located nearby, I met one guy, the owner of a local <a href="http://www.bocaballet.org/">ballet studio</a> .  He is a trained dancer and choreographer.  After we discussed the topic of strong sex in the choreography business, for the sake of contrast, I mentioned that my business is software.  In general, I like what I do, but, how to say, because of my profession, I don‚Äôt often see attractive and accessible girls.  My work is very different from the work of a photographer, marketing executive, fashion designer, yoga instructor or bodyguard.  Probably thousands of similar professions.  But best of all is the ‚Äúballet dancer‚Äù or the owner of a dance company. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Well, in general, after I touched the topic of software, the guy began to talk about how he once wrote a system for booking tickets for his performances.  He began to say something about Access, FoxPro, and even Visual Basic.  He had no idea what was waiting for him when he started creating a platform for his business six or seven years ago.  And recently he abandoned his homegrown program and switched to software from a third-party vendor. <br><habracut></habracut><br>  As a next example, I can give the owner of an average real estate firm.  After my promotional presentation, during which I then concluded our first major deal, he began to talk about a program that he wrote on dark 4GL and used in his work.  I felt that he, his marketing director and sales director (all three of my interlocutors are people who are far from technology) want to tell me literally everything about it. <br><br>  I perfectly understood the motivation of these people to tell me in detail about what they did.  Such knowledge is a matter of personal pride and can be respected by others.  Software creation is a huge intellectual adventure.  This is something that only someone who once created something like this can understand.  Most people have a rather vague idea of ‚Äã‚Äãhow art, music, books, and movies are created.  Software creation is something else and for a non-professional, not an engineer, usually stands apart from other creative processes.  This is how to climb to the top of the mountain.  One thing.  Sometimes you just want to shake someone and say: ‚ÄúLook what I did !!!  Can you imagine that it works !!? ‚ÄùAnyone else would either look at you embarrassedly or with a polite smile say‚Äú yes, great. ‚ÄùWell, I would smile and answer something in the style of‚Äú I understand and respect you .

      At the heart of any business is a data model, even if it is just a program for accounting.  Often the only one who understands the whole business well is either the director of the company, its owner, or the founder.  It often happens that such people just look at some process and realize that they need a better system than this.  So, it turns out that if a commercial product is unsatisfactory or unavailable, and there is no money to hire a developer (and sometimes, it is not even known where and how to hire it), they just sit down and begin to figure out what will help them create a better system. .  So, it seems, many systems are born. <br><br>  I do not want to somehow diminish the merits of such self-taught, not professionals, moreover, I respect them more than some of the pros.  The system written by such self-taught people will seem terrible to professionals, but if it intelligently performs its function, it is beautiful.  You must love her. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/30922/">https://habr.com/ru/post/30922/</a></p>
