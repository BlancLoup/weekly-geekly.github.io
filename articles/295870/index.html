  <section class="page js-page"><h1>434 registrations in the first week - as we promoted a free callback</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Hello! <br><br>  Last week we launched the free version of the <a href="http://redconnect.ru/">RedConnect Free callback</a> .  We did this, first of all, to increase the number of registrations and the virality of our product.  It's time to take the first results.  To say that we managed to achieve a result is to say nothing.  The flow of new registrations has overwhelmed our managers, so much so that we had to reduce the momentum of promotion. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/38f/282/ee0/38f282ee08d34b2694bc7f59567c6d05.png">

      About all this - more. <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  Since we have a free product, promotion costs are minimal.  All the methods that we used can be divided into categories: paid and free. <br><br><h3>  Paid ways of promotion </h3><br>  Paid methods quickly give a tangible increase in the number of registrations, but only as long as there is money in the account.  First of all, we are talking about contextual advertising on Yandex.Direct and Google.Adwords, teaser ads on Vkontakte and Facebook, as well as advertising on Spark.ru. Due to the large flow of new customers, we have so far limited our campaign to Google AdWords and the purchase of an ad unit on Spark .ru <br><br>  <b>For the week, 40 new customers came to contextual advertising.</b>  Costs - 19704 rubles. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/ad3/bcb/fd7/ad3bcbfd756b419ca3eb300291576c0e.png"><br><br>  In our situation, we chose not to chase the number of transitions, and stretch the existing budget for several months, and over time - not to use such advertising for the free version.  It must unwind itself, due to the high virality. <br><br>  The average result was shown by articles in well-known private blogs dedicated to SEO and e-commerce.  Some of the authors independently tested the service and wrote a review, someone took a ready-made press release. <br><br>  Some articles were purchased through the Rotapost service, and some through personal contacts with the authors of blogs.  I once again made sure that blogging is more dead than alive.  Yes, this is not bad for statistics "puzomerok" and positions in the search engine, but not directly affect the registration as we would like.  Nevertheless, this is a good ‚Äúlong‚Äù investment - over time, many registrations will be collected from purchased articles.  And for this week <b>we received 44 registrations</b> from <b>private blogs.</b>  It cost us 35,000 rubles. <br><br>  It was interesting to read the comments under the reviews.  At this moment I was glad - we are on the right track: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/ff9/5c5/464/ff95c546424b4865a4f6c77768217db3.png"><br><br><h3>  Free ways to promote </h3><br>  The first thing we did was prepare a press release about the launch of a free version of the callback for online editions of e-commerce themes.  It does not always work - most of the press releases sent out did not pass the wording, and those that were published saw too few people.  Directly <b>from the press releases, we have not received a single client</b> .  But I hope that in the future they will bring the result in the form of registrations, as it has already been previously with other projects. <br><br>  Next, we prepared a post for corporate blogs on Megamind and Spark.  With greed, I launched the same post in a publication on TJournal, which was immediately merged, although on Megamind it <a href="http://megamozg.ru/company/redhelper/blog/20360/">scored 2 thousand views</a> .  <b>From corporate blogs we have received 17 registrations.</b> <br><br>  Search engines are also a great way to promote: <br><ul><li>  a well-optimized page has a natural flow of targeted visitors </li><li>  those who saw something about a free callback in blogs, articles, press releases, and in advertising too - come to our website through search engines </li></ul><br>  In the first week <b>, 42 people registered with Yandex and Google in RedConnect.</b> <br><br>  Search engines also help in registrations by direct transition, when a visitor starts typing the name of the service, and the browser offers a hint with the address.  <b>Registrations on direct visits accumulated about a hundred</b> . <br><br>  Surely, SMM will show good results, but in the first week we didn‚Äôt devote much effort to this kind of promotion.  <b>Therefore, through the social network came 5 registrations.</b> <br><br><h3>  What gave the maximum effect </h3><br>  If we take the number of registrations as an indicator, then the most effective way was sending by e-mail.  Those who use our online consultant sometimes do not know that we also have callbacks, or are not ready for the cost of the paid version.  As a result, <b>about two hundred clients registered after mailing</b> , not immediately realizing that the personal account of the services is one.  In addition, many customers, who at one time learned about the free version of the callback, literally ‚Äúhung up‚Äù our sales department with a large number of typical questions about the new service. <br><br>  We understood that we would face such a situation.  But I was hoping that many people would first watch our video, which just answers most of the questions: <br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/7bDWnYzpIRY%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700023,15700186,15700191,15700248,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhjp5J9SGyLF4uq_wDSacXBnNvGyuw" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br>  But my hopes did not come true =) <br><br>  Because of this, on the third day we had to greatly reduce the amount of work on promotion - the result could be twice as much.  Unused are Yandex.Direct, targeted ads, teaser ads, SMM, and more. <br><br>  There are advantages to this.  After the initial ‚Äúspurt‚Äù the registration schedule calmed down - an average of 25-30 new customers per day.  As long as we digest the experience gained and change the business processes in the company, this is enough.  When we are fully prepared, we will launch the second round of promotion <a href="http://redconnect.ru/">RedConnect Free</a> .  And see what we can do.  Do not switch! </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/295870/">https://habr.com/ru/post/295870/</a></p>
