This is an online service for converting video and audio files. <br><br>  In short, the service creation history is fairly standard: at some point I was tired of using the ffmpeg command line to convert various media content and wanted something more convenient, and more importantly, cross-platform (because I had to work as from *) nix systems, and with Windows).  So this service was born.  Showed it to a friend (he is by the way on <a href="https://geektimes.ru/users/dk_bbg/" class="user_link">Habr√©</a> - <a href="https://geektimes.ru/users/dk_bbg/" class="user_link">dk_bbg</a> ), he appreciated.  So I decided to put it in public access :-)

      Under the cut a little information about what constitutes a service now. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  A name has been created for the service and is now called <a href="http://encodeit.org/">EncodeIt</a> . <br><br>  Support has been added to virtually all major formats, including the acclaimed WebM format, and the less notorious, but equally popular MKV and M2T (MPEG2 Transport Stream).  We also tried to add support for the most popular mobile devices so that users do not bother with finding out the video support options for them.  For those users who prefer to customize the video conversion settings in more detail, the option of advanced settings for the container format and codecs has been made. <br><br>  There is also support for some popular video hosting sites.  Now this is YouTube and Vkontakte, but the list is going to expand significantly (RuTube, Smotri.com, Vimeo).  Were made "buns" in the form of progress bar loading and transcoding the file. <br><br>  Since its launch, the service has matured a bit.  A 2xXeon QuadCore server was leased, another server is in the ‚Äúcold replacement‚Äù in the form of an Amazon EC2 On-Demand instance (just in case). <br><br>  The number of daily conversions exceeded 200 per day.  This was mainly due to the promotion of increasing the maximum file size to <b>2GB</b> .  And by the way, yes, there are no restrictions on the number of convertible files.  Moreover, registration is not at all mandatory, and is needed only to enable the use of the "Personal Cabinet", which is a place for conveniently managing downloaded and recoded files.  If you still decide to register, then this can be done both in a ‚Äúclassic‚Äù way, and using OpenID. <br><br>  The service also got the 2nd types of API for interacting with it.  The first is called the <b>REST API</b> , and is designed to interact with the service using the REST method.  The second type of API is the <b>Widget API</b> .  This is a JavaScript widget that provides an interface for embedding the ability to convert to various websites.  A unique feature of the Widget API is the ability to organize "transparent" file conversion, without having to save the original (loaded) file on the site that hosted the widget. <br><br>  While all the main and most popular features of the service are free, we charge a small fee for using the API (you need to pay for the server :-).  This is a few rubles for 1 hour of video, the exact cost depends on the number of conversions per month.  We already have several such clients who use the API and don't seem to complain yet. <br><br>  From the next opportunities that we plan to make: <br>  - Proper processing of Aspect Ratio when converting <br>  - Gluing several video or audio files into one <br>  - Ability to reduce / increase the volume <br>  - More detailed and deeper setting of the conversion format <br>  - Conversion "on the fly", to be able to play video or audio file through a browser. <br>  - well, we'll think of something else ... <br><br>  I hope this service will be able to help solve the emerging problems of transcoding various audio and video files.  For all questions, write in the comments or in PM. <br><br>  PS If you do not like the article, please do not minus - I got the karma with great difficulty :-) Better just say about it in the comments.  I will remove the article and next time I will try to write about something more useful, for example, how reservation is provided with Amazon EC2 :-) </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/108567/">https://habr.com/ru/post/108567/</a></p>
