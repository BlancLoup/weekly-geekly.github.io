Interest in this topic is growing day by day, because the blockchain technology has already proven its innovative efficiency.  Before our eyes there are new cryptocurrency systems, more and more convenient and secure.  Cardano SL is the first of these systems written in Haskell.  It is about my features, prospects and why Haskell is, after all, discussed in my report. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/5c2/35c/f59/5c235cf5976442f568cff26590e4399b.png" alt="image" align="left">  <b>Nikolai Ryzhikov</b> , the technical leader of the Health Samurai team, an activist from St. Petersburg's Ruby &amp; Clojure communities and the Piter-united meta-community. <br><br>  <b>FULL STACK ON ‚ÄúONE‚Äù LANGUAGE OR RICH HIKKI ISOMORPHISM</b> <br><br>  We offer you a report on how it is possible to develop along the entire stack from infrastructure to mobile phones and layout with CSS in the same language - Clojure.

In spite of the fact that technically there is no problem with this, there are various difficulties from an ideological point of view.  For example, when you do not want to use mutable classes in your code.  Or when retrieving data in the form of JavaBeans from one library, you need to use them in another library written in Scala and implying the use of case classes.  BeanPur√©e is a library that allows you to reduce the pain of using JavaBeans in Scala.  It not only allows you to automatically convert bins into case classes and vice versa, but is primarily a connecting link between the world of Java and shapeless.  I will try to do a little excursion into programming on types in Scala, tell you how to use shapeless and BeanPur√©e, and also show how it works from the inside. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/9db/e04/cc8/9dbe04cc872aa0a104fb186330cf217b.jpg" alt="image" align="left"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/856/b10/c24/856b10c24b4a157376a22b417af3e5ac.jpg" alt="image" align="left">  <b>Yuri Syrovetsky</b> , Haskellist at Kaspersky Lab, an activist of the RuHaskell community, a teacher at the Moscow Chemical Lyceum and <b>Yuri Loginov</b> , a pupil of the 11th class at the Moscow Chemical Lyceum, a functional programming enthusiast. <br><br>  <b>CRDT - CORRECTLY DISTRIBUTED DATA ON HASKELL</b> <br><br>  CRDT is a tool for reliable data storage and synchronization in distributed systems.  Of course, this model must be implemented in the most reliable programming language - Haskell!  We will tell you what problems you encountered, how you solved issues of reliability and proof of the correctness of code based on type classes. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/f07/916/444/f07916444876b82cb0777d48557b2b32.jpg" alt="image" align="left">  <b>Nikita Sobolev</b> , partner of wemake.services development studio, code writer, organizer elixir-lang.moscow. <br><br>  <b>FLOWS.</b>  <b>OTP.</b>  <b>ELIXIR</b> <br><br>  Different programming languages ‚Äã‚Äãuse different asynchronous models.  In Erlang and Elixir there is a whole framework for working with asynchrony - OTP.  Let's talk about its device, measure the speed of work, consider the typical use-cases.  Let's add all graphs and metrics! <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/0e4/e25/6ac/0e4e256acd0b3ed623a2b7c98c7b4bca.jpg" alt="image" align="left">  <b>Anton Kholomiev</b> , the author of the book "Haskell Tutorial" and the Haskell Music Library: csound-expression. <br><br>  <b>KOTLIN LANGUAGE - ISLAND TREASURE FOR OP ON ANDROID</b> <br><br>  If you look at the chronicle of conferences on FI, it is not difficult to see that the main topic of the reports is WEB.  Mobile development is bypassed.  And for good reason!  Functional languages ‚Äã‚Äãare luminaries with luxurious memory consumption and a model of representations typical for FP designs poorly fit into the limitations of mobile applications. <br>  But in the sky of OP, a new star has risen and its light is getting brighter and brighter!  We will talk about the new Kotlin language and how to use it on Android.  Using the example of live working code, we will look at how to do this in a functional style.  The appearance of Kotlin can open the doors to Android development for many fans of FP and make this journey enjoyable and exciting. <br>  * The Kotlin language was developed by Russian engineers from JetBrains and named after the island on which the city of Kronstadt is located. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/0ed/726/5b6/0ed7265b6d0cd4c675cccc5b6f9bca64.jpg" alt="image" align="left">  <b>Dmitry Volkov</b> , a Haskellist for money, a formal verifier, and Coq'olub for the idea.

Often, dynamically typed scripting languages ‚Äã‚Äãare used for such tasks, because writing scripts to them is so quick and easy!  But writing safe and predictably working scripts requires a certain discipline. <br>  This report will show that the same tasks that we usually solve with Bash / Python / (your version) can also be solved in Haskell, while obtaining <br><br>  - greater safety and predictability; <br>  - cross-platform (written once the script will work in unix-like systems, and on Windows); <br>  - the same speed and ease of development (types do not have to write, you will not even need to compile anything - if you do not want!) <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/6d5/b90/708/6d5b90708a4d9098a2ae2a4d614a4a73.jpg" alt="image" align="left">  <b>Alexander Vershilov</b> , haskell developer at Tweag I / O. <br><br>  <b>WE PROJECT THE SAAS SOLUTION, LAUNCHING ON THE LAPTOP</b> <br><br>  If you are thinking about how to design an application, so that it works locally, on a weak laptop, or it would be a horizontally expandable cloud application.  So why not get everything at once using the same code?  It is very important for companies to be able to quickly adapt to changing requirements.  Powerful abstractions in Haskell make it easy to write an application that can both work in cloud saving and can be used as an executable file in Windows. <br><br>  In the report we will consider the architectural decisions that allowed this to be done.  We will look at the structure of the code and the tools that allowed us to easily obtain platform-specific solutions, as well as various problems we encountered in implementation. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/0c8/870/9ee/0c88709ee84320c8ebc45302a4e56c5a.png" alt="image" align="left">  <b>Pavel Argentov</b> , a practicing fp-programmer, OCaml lover, developer in Evrone. <br><br>  <b>LEARNING TO PLAY UNIKERNEL</b> <br><br>  Unikernel is an application development framework that will run in a certain virtualization environment using the ‚Äúone computer - one process‚Äù principle.  In some ways, this is a return from the world of multi-tasking multi-user general-purpose OS to the world of ‚Äúfirmware‚Äù.  In another way - this is the way out to that level of application creation, when the program lives in its very small, very fast-loaded, hacked-well-and-well, dropped-well-and-not-sorry capsule.  The application itself is an operating system with a ‚Äúmicrokernel‚Äù - a thin loader / monitor in the manner of an old MS-DOS.  Developed on OCaml MirageOS is perhaps the first successful project of a fully mature ‚Äúlibrary OS‚Äù.  I know OCaml, and therefore the experiment with the product in this language seemed to me the most painless.  In the report, I will go over the main points of creating a Mirage application using a simple learning example. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/302/fc5/3ec/302fc53ecf3e9e15fa3d5f2dae343037.jpg" alt="image" align="left">  <b>Katerina Galkina is a</b> developer at GetShop.TV, a graduate student at VMK MSU, who participates in teaching a workshop at LISP at VMK MSU. <br><br>  <b>OUR BUGS FOR TWO YEARS OF HASKELL DEVELOPMENT</b> <br><br>  Our backend is a little less than full written in Haskell.  The compiler finds most of the potentially fatal errors for us, but it cannot save from everything.  In my report, I will tell you what problems we had, why it happened and what serious mistakes Haskell saves us from. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/313/fd9/56c/313fd956cefd726d53bc1edc2aaf9c96.jpg" alt="image" align="left">  <b>Alexander Chichigin</b> , a haskell programmer at Typeable.io.

Let's talk about the language F *, refinement types, equational reasoning, program transformation, formal verification.  Rakes and roundabout maneuvers.  You will learn several techniques of using refinement types (or liquid types) to prove the completeness and equivalence of functions using the example of optimizing the list sorting algorithm. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/7ef/db2/cf7/7efdb2cf7e2ed31243e54ecd6b9d8c28.png" alt="image" align="left">  <b>Sergey Tkachenko</b> , a frontend developer, clojure intuziasist, organizer of the Moscow Clojure community. <br><br>  <b>OOP FOR BRAVE AND TRUE</b> <br><br>  Recently, the theme of the battle between the methodologies of OOP and AF is very often raised.  But in fact, these two methodologies were created with the same goal - to get rid of the imperative (procedural) programming style.  Unfortunately, at some point in the PLO, the methodology remained so completely and not understood.  In this talk I will try to shed light on what a modern OOP code is and how to use it in a functional language like Clojure.  This report will be useful not only to Clojure developers, but to all developers who use functional languages ‚Äã‚Äãand, mistakenly, consider OOP to be the root of all evil. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/ea0/ee5/fbe/ea0ee5fbe64c6e9ef4bb478ebc56678d.jpg" alt="image" align="left">  <b>Vadim Chelyshov</b> , working in hydrosphere.io, one of the leading podcast scalalaz.ru. <br><br>  <b>WE MAKE USER API ON THE BASIS OF SHAPELESS</b> <br><br>  Scala developers rarely have to deal with dependent types, although a decent layer of libraries we work with every day use them under the hood. <br>  The purpose of my report is to make PR colleagues with the addition of a shapeless depending on the project no longer cause you to panic. <br><br>  - consider unobvious moments <br>  - find out how to understand this code <br>  - find out what benefits can be obtained from the practical use of shapeless <br>  - understand why you should drag it into your project. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/cc3/efb/6f5/cc3efb6f55eae26d1b601d6739eb842f.jpg" alt="image" align="left">  <b>Nikolay Kudasov</b> , technical director and co-founder of GetShop.TV, Haskell course teacher at VMK MSU, Haskell-enthusiast since 2010. <br><br>  <b>FUNCTIONAL VIRTUAL REALITY: WEBVR + HASKELL</b> <br><br>  Virtual reality is more accessible than it might seem.
