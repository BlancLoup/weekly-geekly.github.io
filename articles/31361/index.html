  <section class="page js-page"><h1>My favorite meditation</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Here is a simple but effective meditation that you might like.  Learning the basics of meditation is not the purpose of this note (maybe someone will write a comment referring to the meditation guide for those who have not done it yet, but if you are already familiar with this, I think you will find this meditation interesting and valuable. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  I did not learn this meditation from someone ‚Äî it‚Äôs just what I did once, and I‚Äôve been doing it for 10 years now. <br><br>  At first I bring myself completely to a relaxed and calm state.  Then I imagine in my mind a special room in which there are two chairs facing each other.  I sit on the same chair, and on the opposite chair, I imagine myself in five years.  He is like my ideal ‚ÄúI‚Äù that I wish to become.  He is physically fit, strong, courageous, confident, enthusiastic, passionate, enthusiastic, etc.  We talk with him for 5-10 minutes: I ask questions, and he answers them with pleasure.  Usually he looks at me almost with a sense of nostalgia and sympathy, as he knows where I am now, and what challenges of fate I accept - challenges that he has long cope with. <br><br>  In the end, my future "I" is leaving.  Then I get up and sit on his chair, and my past ‚ÄúI am five years ago‚Äù enters and sits on the first chair.  Thus, now I, the future ‚Äúme‚Äù (Steve 2005), look at my past ‚Äúme‚Äù (Steve 2000).  I need a little time to remember what exactly my life was five years ago and what that past Steve is experiencing.  Now he asks me about his future (my present), and I answer him.  Often, looking back, I am amazed at how trivial the challenges facing him seem to me to be trivial and simple today, although I remember that they seemed to me much more majestic when I was in his skin.  I take the time to convince Steve 2000 that everything will turn out well for Steve 2005. I also let him know what tasks I have not solved and are still working on their solution.

      After that, I take another step and waste time for another five years.  Now I am Steve 2010, and I meet with Steve 2005. I look back at my current position from the future - from the vantage point, where I have already solved my biggest tasks.  Now I see how Steve 2005 asks the same questions that I previously asked Steve 2010, and I am able to answer them definitely and confidently. <br><br>  Next, I introduce the three of us together in a room (Steve 2000, Steve 2005, Steve 2010), while our bodies are transparent.  We merge into one person with a flash of light.  When this happens, I am overwhelmed with emotions - every time I do this meditation, I experience different feelings.  We become a single whole, a single being, which is present outside the time coordinates, but is divided in time in order to experience a sense of growth and change. <br><br>  When I slowly come out of this meditation, I feel very peaceful and calm.  But the most important benefit is the feeling of wholeness, the feeling that I am more than a physical being moving forward in time.  I feel like an integral being, which is present in all times, but just focuses my mind on a certain moment in order to live it more fully.  When I am in such a state of soul, I see the present moment as something inside my being, instead of a more general sense of self, inside the reality of the present moment.  The consequence of this is that current worries and anxieties disappear, and instead a feeling of extensibility and transcendence.  My new perception reduces the significance and size of current problems, which leads to their easy and sometimes simple solutions to triviality. <br><br>  I suggest you make this meditation at least once so that you can decide whether it will be as useful for you as it is for me. <br><br>  Original: <a href="http://www.steve-pavlina.ru/">Self-development for smart people</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/31361/">https://habr.com/ru/post/31361/</a></p>
