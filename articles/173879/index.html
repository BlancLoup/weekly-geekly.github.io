The author of the note is Olga Belkova, MP, a former partner of the business accelerator Eastlabs.  I would like to supplement the article with my own comments and observations, since I know that this topic is disturbing to many.  All of the following is my personal opinion. <br><br><h4>  Not Zuckerberg united </h4><br>  The first thing that I would like to draw attention to is a great focus on the success of Zuckerberg, as well as the creators of Instagram (earlier such examples were Bill Gates, Steve Jobs and Google creators Sergey Brin and Larry Page).  These examples are exceptions even for Silicon Valley, and cannot serve as a role model. <a name="habracut"></a>

    <blockquote>  Everyone gasps - Zuckerman, Zuckerfeld!  When he recently visited Moscow, everyone was in a slight bewilderment - a person can not connect two words, uninteresting, uncharismatic.  And this is a cherished role model?  You include the brain, without millions of investments, (and probably state support) such projects as FB are not born.  People need a romantic tale about a single student - you will be a fairy tale.  <a href="http://www.facebook.com/bo44arov">(with)</a> </blockquote><br>  If you read articles about successful entrepreneurs of silicones in the same Forbes, then you can see that most of the successful entrepreneurs went very long to success - they graduated from prestigious universities, worked for 10-15 years at IBM, Microsoft, Apple, etc.  and only then, having vast knowledge, means and connections, they started their own business. <br><br>  Therefore, with beautiful stories about young guys who have earned billions of dollars from scratch, you need to be more careful. <br><br><h4>  Education </h4><br>  Another reason is bad education.  Type learn theory, but you need to learn the practice. <br><br>  I do not agree with this statement, because  Practice orientation is the way to the world of outsourcing, in which we all live.  The task of the theory is to force (or teach) to think, and a thinking person, unlike a rational person, is at a higher stage of evolution and will easily learn how to apply knowledge in practice. <br><br>  But still, our education (as well as education within most IT companies) has drawbacks. <br><br>  For example, IT professionals, as a rule, have little sense in marketing, sales, risk theory, law, etc.  (although this knowledge is critical for creating a business), but they are forced to teach unnecessary subjects (on the move I can recall such wonderful subjects as ecology, chemistry, and labor protection for 3-5 courses). <br><br>  But we have flourishing trainings, courses on the topic ‚Äúhow to create your own business‚Äù, ‚Äú10 main mistakes of young entrepreneurs‚Äù, ‚Äúhow to become an entrepreneur in 21 days‚Äù, which for the most part are in enormous success, but are absolutely useless except for those people reads them.  No, I personally know very intelligent teachers and business coaches, but against the background of the overall picture, they are lost. <br><br><h4>  Thinking and approach </h4><br>  The second problem is a completely different approach in our thinking and cultural features. <br><br><blockquote>  - What are you, the smartest? <br>  - Sit down and do not hang out! <br>  - Be simpler and people will reach for you! </blockquote><br>  This is not a complete list of phrases that are awarded to particularly active people, i.e.  killing any desire to do differently. <br><br>  Somehow I had to communicate with the head of a research center of a German university ‚Äî a woman from Ukraine, who had long since left for Germany and lives there.  The conversation was about the possibility of internship, exchange of experience.  It was in graduate school, i.e.  the intentions were the most serious. <br><br><blockquote>  - You understand, Sash, the question is not whether you are smart here or not, and not even whether the education system is good or bad.  The question is that it is <i>different</i> .  In Europe, other <i>approaches</i> , other <i>assessment criteria</i> .  Even if we take you on an internship, you will have 2-3 years to adopt the atmosphere and our approaches. </blockquote><br>  Something like this. <br><br><h4>  Bad business environment </h4><br>  Rather, its absence.  Political, economic and other reasons - you know what I mean.  But, oddly enough, this is all solved in one way or another. <br><br>  In the valley, no project survives without investment.  Well, no matter how hard I would like to believe the opposite, it does not work.  Most projects are unprofitable for 3-7 years (Twitter, Tumblr, Wordpress, Instagram), etc.  So the question is, who can afford 5-7 years for us to work for the future in the hope that your classmate, Zuckerberg will buy you? <br><br>  <i>* The most interesting thing is that after receiving investment in silicone, projects are mainly done by our outsourcing companies.</i> <br><br>  We look at our business incubators and investors.  One removes a pornorolik to attract attention, another confuses the concept of business angels and investors, others consider that for 20-30 thousand dollars startupers should give the <s>devil</s> 15-20% of the company, etc., some more successfully beat the money investors and now they are reading the trainings ‚Äúhow not to save the investors' money‚Äù. <br><br>  The task of an entrepreneur is to create a successful business, and, as <i>one of the options</i> , to sell it.  Investors are looking for undervalued projects / people to exit (sell the business) at the peak.  These are different approaches, in my opinion. <br><br>  As a result, many complain that there are no normal projects, although for some reason no one is willing to <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/167757/">invest in a project that already brings money</a> .  Well, and so on, you can find a lot of examples.  Oh, and yes, for some reason, we have a start-up in the role of a poor relative, who does not risk anything, and, bastard, he does not want to sell his apartment to finance his startup :-) <br><br>  Another problem is that many are ready to invest in clones of successful products - 4sq, discount sites, social networks, where the monetization model is understandable and run-in. <br><br>  The question is, how can new revolutionary projects emerge if you only look at clones of successful <i>dating services with a geological and freemium model</i> ? <br><br>  But in fact, IT people need to pray to an outsourcing :-) It allows you to earn competitive money without having to steam about all this parsley, drinking coffee in a cozy office near the tennis table.  But explain why IT people need to leave their familiar comfort zone and start writing startups - the task of the business elite, which is now like a gopher - we don‚Äôt see it, and it‚Äôs likely to be somewhere. <br><br>  Thanks for attention! </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/173879/">https://habr.com/ru/post/173879/</a></p>
