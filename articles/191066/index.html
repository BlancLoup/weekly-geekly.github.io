  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Cowon AE1: another unusual recorder from the manufacturer of players</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  If my memory serves me, I became acquainted with Cowon products in 2006.  Then I chose my first music player and eventually bought Cowon iAudio F1.  Then he used D2 and S9.  It was evident that the company is small, which in some ways it is inferior to Apple and Samsung (for example, in the reasonableness of the interfaces and their localization), but in general, its products aroused respect.  I will not talk about sound - I liked it, someone, of course, did not like it. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/c2b/e30/744/c2be30744e59c4c10e955ba6b3755429.jpg"><br><br>  Today, when pocket players are rapidly losing popularity, their manufacturers are actively trying to find other areas of activity.  (I covered this topic <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/smartgadget/blog/186786/">in this post</a> ) Cowon has switched to DVRs.  First, she released the model AC1, then AW1 with support for Wi-Fi and the ability to control from a smartphone.  And now she presents her third avtoreg - AE1.  It is curious that it is already presented in Russia and will cost from 6,600 to 7,600 rubles, depending on the amount of memory. <a name="habracut"></a>

And there, and there it says only support MicroSD up to 32 GB.  Probably, this is not about the built-in memory, namely about the complete flash drive.  The kit also includes a card reader. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/254/751/418/2547514182870b9584cab292f63adeb1.jpg"><br><br>  In general, the recorder turned out to be entertaining.  First, it has a 2.8-inch screen made by Samsung.  Is it a lot or a little?  Rather a lot: the most ‚Äúlarge screen‚Äù recorders, presented in Russia, are equipped with displays with a diagonal of 2.7 inches (Lexand LR-4800, AdvoCam-FD5 Profi, etc.) At the same time, the AE1 has a touchscreen, which is also unusual. <br><br>  The interface of the model resembles Windows Phone - see the screenshots below: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/d4c/52a/fb4/d4c52afb4e3bb2a7ec2d6c717d16b6d6.jpg"><br><br>  The lens consists of 6 glass lenses (F2.0), the viewing angle on the diagonal is 120 degrees.  Matrix 2-megapixel (CMOS, 1 / 3,2 ").  Recording is carried out with a maximum resolution of 1280 x 720 pixels and a frequency of 30 frames per second.  At first glance, it is not enough by modern standards.  But the resolution resolution, but the quality is high - day and night: <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/9s3RnuB2sOk%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700022,15700186,15700190,15700253,15700256,15700258&amp;usg=ALkJrhjtEyqVxDQcXVn7pXWqTbBQtLMdlg" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/1cG-Rkn3tNg%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700022,15700186,15700190,15700253,15700256,15700258&amp;usg=ALkJrhh4AuJF_n6goeqLMLYe4DX_MEqcIQ" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  The device has a G-sensor: after it triggers as a result of an impact (sudden braking, turning, etc.), a 30-second file is recorded (15 s before the event and 15 s after), which is automatically transferred to the protected area on the card and excluded from the process cyclic rewriting.  Motion detection to start recording when a moving object appears in the field of view of the lens in the Cowon AE1 is also.  But the battery, apparently, no. <br><br>  From the curious one, I will also single out a certain bicycle mode (the corresponding mount, as I understand it, is not included in the kit) and a system that monitors the temperature of the recorder and automatically turns it off when it overheats.  This is true, for example, if you left the car in the heat and went somewhere for a long time.  Even in Cowon AE1 there is a voice prompt system, and the support for the Russian language is promised (it is not surprising - with its registrars, Cowon primarily focuses on South Korea and Russia, where today there is a boom of such devices). <br><br>  With the GPS module, the situation is interesting.  In the device itself it is not, but you can buy an external solution.  Here it is: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/d96/90c/ef6/d9690cef6396f311d329c5b90d1dd7fa.jpg"><br><br>  The functions of the GPS module seem to be standard - it determines the speed, the recorder writes a motion track, and then the latter can be superimposed on a map on a computer (Windows only) using a special program.  However, the Russian site Cowon distinguished himself with the following phrase: ‚ÄúYou can connect an external GPS module to the gadget and use it as a navigator.‚Äù  Yes Yes.  And the cards from Navitel roll on top.  In short, the GPS receiver is used in the Cowon AE1 just as in the case of other recorders with this component - no navigation. <br><br>  The mount looks like this: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/5b4/437/300/5b44373009dd7828296316ace49937d0.jpg"><br><br>  It is very compact, which is good, but, on the other hand, it does not provide for the possibility of quickly turning the recorder towards the window, which the insidious seller of striped sticks already looks into.  It is curious that the fastening is attached to the glass not by means of a sucker, but by means of 3M adhesive tape.  This option is still rare in the Russian market, although in some models it already occurs - for example, in the Lexand LR-5000. <br><br>  In general, a curious model turned out - but this is in theory.  With practice more difficult, you need to test.  Not the fact that in reality everything will be as rosy as in the pictures.  Vaughn iriver, too, at one time took up the readers, and in fact with some pomp, but her readers, by and large, were inferior and inferior to the models of market leaders. <br><br>  Would you buy a Cowon recorder?  By the way, the company at one time began to make tablets on Windows 7, but then from this segment quietly "merged".  As if the same thing did not happen with its ‚Äúregistration‚Äù initiatives ... </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/191066/">https://habr.com/ru/post/191066/</a></p>
