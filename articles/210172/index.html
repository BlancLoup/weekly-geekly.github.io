  <section class="page js-page"><h1>MS Surface vs iPad Air: on what is preferable to write mobile applications for the corporate segment?</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  This review is designed to compare and show the benefits of one of the platforms (Microsoft Surface 2, Apple iPad).  The option of using the tablet is not for entertainment, but as a working tool.  A comparison is made in all parameters of devices: appearance, accessories, power and "vitality" of the battery and, most importantly, the operating system and the available software products.  At the end of the review, it is concluded which device is the most convenient corporate tablet. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a><h5>  General view </h5><br><ol><li>  <b>The size of</b> both devices is about the same.  Note that Surface 2 is a widescreen device, while the iPad has a 3: 4 ratio.  The screen resolution is slightly higher in the iPad (2048x1536 in the iPad against 1920x1080 in the Surface 2).  The pictures on the left show the Apple product, on the right, Microsoft Surface 2. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/764/77a/0bf/76477a0bf782bf69242c4377a51c86e8.jpg"></li><li>  <b>Appearance of devices</b> .  As already mentioned, Surface 2 looks more serious due to direct forms.  On the back of both devices is a camera and a logo.  On the side panels, Surface 2 has USB and micro HDMI ports.  IPad has no additional I / O ports. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/8c0/236/65d/8c023665d276bd6b6af74b70a6816a69.jpg"></li><li>  <b>Additional features of the case</b> .  Thanks to the snap-in stand, it is possible to install the Surface 2 tablet in an inclined mode on a horizontal surface.  The iPad does not have this feature in the basic configuration.  For iPad there is an opportunity to buy a stand as an additional accessory. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/c73/d8b/c05/c73d8bc05e333584e967657d2389e20c.jpg"></li><li>  <b>Keyboard</b> .  The set for Surface 2 has the opportunity to buy a thin keyboard, which will simultaneously be a cover for the device screen.  This accessory is designed directly by Microsoft and is available simultaneously with the purchase of the tablet.  In this configuration, Surface 2 quickly turns into a convenient tool for printing texts.  Taking into account the stand on the rear panel, it becomes almost a laptop.  For iPad, there is no standard keyboard from the manufacturer, but you can find it from third-party manufacturers. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/dce/082/caa/dce082caa2c0f5df18639b0f548ee29e.jpg"></li></ol><br><h5>  Filling </h5><br><ol><li>  <b>The processor of</b> both devices is in the same performance class.  The iPad processor wins slightly in power.  But the power of the processor is manifested, rather, in the "game" mode.  If the purpose of the tablet is a ‚Äúworking tool‚Äù, then the user will not notice the difference in performance. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/abd/1d3/909/abd1d390991c582a2f5492794341f151.jpg"></li><li>  Microsoft's <b>RAM is</b> larger, 2 GB vs. 1 GB for the iPad.  In practice, this affects the speed of work in programs operating with big data (tables, large presentations, etc.). <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/d70/8cc/6c7/d708cc6c7bc6609c78f933d9a4b71ae0.jpg"></li><li>  <b>Disk</b>  The volume in both cases depends on the purchased configuration.  In turn, this affects the price of the device.  If we are talking about the mode of use for work, then we can take the configuration from a 32 GB disk.  It'll be enough.  An additional important advantage of Surface 2 is the presence of a MicroSD slot, which allows, if necessary, to expand the disk capacity, as well as to quickly copy data (for example, from cameras or other mobile devices). <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/277/5f8/8a3/2775f88a379b1bd2bc2388d12754eff9.jpg"></li><li>  <b>Battery</b>  Devices have approximately the same capacity.  Allow to work autonomously for up to 10 hours. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/4c1/3a7/3f3/4c13a73f35812fcc05cf697b71115984.jpg"></li><li>  <b>I / O ports</b> .  Apple‚Äôs conservative strategy in this case plays against users.  The iPad has only one port - Lightning, through which the device is charged.  Lightning-USB, Lightning-HDMI extension cables are also available.  But they are purchased separately.  The inconvenience is the need to take along these cables.  In Surface 2, we have everything out of the box.  By the way, the presence of a USB port can help in some cases when you need to charge, for example, a phone. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/d31/629/805/d31629805aa74bc3a23260fb2ccf8f96.jpg"></li></ol><br><h5>  Operating system and software </h5><br><ol><li>  <b>Operating system</b>  Windows 8 RT as a working / auxiliary device is definitely much more suitable for users who in their daily working life use Windows as a working platform.  And the main factor here is not even usability.  The fact is that in Surface 2 in addition to the panel with tiles, there is quite a normal desktop.  The user can work on it in exactly the same way as on a regular computer: place files, search for the necessary documents, work in the Internet browser, and so on.  That is, the user, going home from work, on a trip and on a business trip, takes a tablet with him.  At the same time on the road or at home, he can continue to work in the same mode - write text or prepare a presentation.  To do this, simply copy the file to the device. </li><li>  <b>Unconditional plus of Windows 8</b> is the possibility of parallel operation of two or more applications at the same time.  iPad also has a very user-friendly interface, which even children will understand.  But the professional habits of office staff usually take over if we are talking specifically about work, and not about entertainment.  The x86 programs (normal Windows programs) cannot be installed and run on a Surface 2 tablet, just as Mac OS programs cannot be run on an iPad.  If necessary, you can purchase Surface Pro, which supports the launch of Desktop programs for Windows. </li><li>  <b>Skydrive</b> .  Allows you to synchronize files over the Internet.  An employee can, almost without interruption, work on a single document that is synchronized through the SkyDrive secure storage.  For him, it will be like editing the same file on both the work computer and the tablet.  For example, if you need to urgently write a document, but it's time to get ready and go to the airport, you can not interrupt work in a taxi and on an airplane. </li><li>  <b>Application Store</b> .  Both tablets have access to the store of paid and free applications.  The number of surpasses Apple.  But if you look at the stores from a working point of view, then you won't see much of a difference.  Most Apple Store apps are entertainment apps, and they can't carry workload support for workflows. </li><li>  <b>Office</b> .  Buying a Surface 2 tablet, a user gets a licensed version of MS Office.  This includes Word, Excel, Power Point, OneNote, Outlook. </li></ol><br><h5>  Price </h5><br>  The starting price at the time the products appeared on the US market differed by 50 USD in favor of Surface.  The cost was taken without taking into account the cost of accessories (for example, a keyboard case from Microsoft).  At the time of writing the price review on the Yandex Market, the average price and price range: <br><br>  <b>Microsoft Surface</b>

And yes, we all know about Surface's reputation, its flaws and the number of negative reviews on the Internet. <br><br>  We apologize to all those whose aesthetic feelings as a result of reading the article were hurt, thanks in advance for accusing us of attention to us :) Those who will agree to change the common point of view and see mobile devices as an addition to the office environment, Those who are ready to lead constructive criticism or, even better, share their experience, are welcome in the comments! <br><br>  Pictures borrowed <a href="http://www.gizmag.com/ipad-air-vs-surface-2/29629/">here</a> . <br><br></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/210172/">https://habr.com/ru/post/210172/</a></p>
