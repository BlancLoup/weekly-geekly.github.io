What I plan to do in this post, although its main reason - to cause a discussion (on an independent platform), since hundreds of pages of discussion on the TRU resulted in a targeted flood and thick trolling.  I hope Habr will allow a more balanced view of the situation. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/4c8/d86/ca9/4c8d86ca9e9e4a1667171cbe895276cf.png"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  <code>&lt; offtop&gt;</code> Before writing this post sat down to view the archive discussion of the cancellation of the rating ... Philosophical lesson, I tell you.  Thanks to the administration for leaving at least one of hundreds of pages (thousands of messages in three days).  Much has been rubbed, the signatures and avatars have changed, with the help of which the usernames appealed to conscience, logic and were simply joking.  But even after six months, the spirit of protest and the feeling of confusion and powerlessness remained.  At the same time, it seems that the administration left an archive of the discussion for edification.  To see <s>slaves</s> yuzerneyma who rules the ball.  However, it is their right and my speculation. <br><br>  This is a saying.  And here is a fairy tale ... But in the beginning I would like to warn you: by <u>reading the following, you run the risk of wasting time without good.</u>  <u>Due to the lack of insider information, this post is practically nothing</u> .  Just a proposal for discussion, thinking out loud and other useless reflections.  Here ... now you can invite an ambulance to the stage. <br> <code>&lt;/ offtop&gt;</code> <br> <br>  I'll start with the "information bureau reports." <br>  February 23, 2012 (which already causes unhealthy conspiracy thoughts and apocalyptic associations) on the largest tracker of the RuNet <a href="http://rutracker.org/forum/viewtopic.php%3Fp%3D51401826">suddenly turned off the rating</a> .  Without a declaration of war and explanation. <br><br>  The most interesting thing is that even moderators, the technical assistance group, etc. did not know about the upcoming sabotage. <br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/468/2f2/d42/4682f2d42fc8d7e98ef4f34bca82d68e.jpg"></a>

      In the discussion of this hum ... "news" immediately appeared the first dissatisfied.  They complained about the loss of active hands (one of the five servers is disabled), an unusual profile view and other inconveniences.  But already then someone said the main thing: <br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/57f/ae8/933/57fae8933e09a46a165c5e15616eaf8c.jpg"></a> <br><br>  As a result, the voice of the people very quickly turned into a moan-refrain: <br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/fe4/f05/488/fe4f05488e0e9997bc54c70046412c0a.jpg"></a> <br><br>  The administration, which is significant, did not deign to condescend to explain what was happening.  Approximate personalities unsubscribed mysterious hints <br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">eg</b> <div class="spoiler_text"> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/80a/f52/37f/80af5237f7816a241320870a0e3a6e80.jpg"></a> </div></div>  Naturally, in the conditions of the information vacuum, theories and conjectures arose ... <br><br>  In fairness it should be noted that there were those who supported the innovations. <br>  As common sense and the profiles of these users suggest, the cancellation of the rating pleased, first of all, comrades with weak Internet channels and lovers of loyalty from distribution. <br>  Many simply blamed the disgruntled at karmodr *** ***.  From the point of view of my cockroaches, this is tantamount to accusations at Habr√© that someone, they say, wrote an article just to get out of the minuses or earn an invite.  IMHO, if only the article was interesting, and the stimulus was not so important.  In my opinion, tights and other ryushi can tell a person how useful it is for a given resource, and also symbolize a certain recognition of the merits of the user by the community. <br>  In general, the bucha in the discussion was that one.  And yet a lot of the cancellation of the rating came to mind. <br>  I don't blame them.  Creating comfortable and mutually beneficial <u>for all</u> (well, at least for most) file-sharing conditions is a problem and the task of the administration.  The fact that innovations have found support from a certain part of users still does not mean that they are good (as well as bad ones).  Just about the essence of change (and about what they can lead to in the end) you can make an idea by reading the reviews of those who <u>actively</u> like them or dislike them. <br><br>  Archive discussion remained.  There are also questions. <br><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">1. What were the real reasons for canceling the rating?</b> <div class="spoiler_text">  It was a lot of assumptions.  I will list the points, adding a short comment. <br>  <b>1. Raider capture.</b> <br>  It is difficult to comment for lack of data. <br><br>  <b>2. Reducing the computational load on the server.</b> <br>  Judging by the fact that statistics are currently being kept, no one has tried to reduce the ‚Äúserver load‚Äù in this way. <br><br>  <b>3. Hitting power departments or left-owners, as a result of which it was decided to ‚Äúhide‚Äù the statistics of users - for their own protection.</b>  <b>This also includes suspicions that the abolition of statistics is associated with Russia's accession to the WTO.</b> <br>  As you can see, now anyone can learn the statistics, so this item also disappears. <br><br>  <b>4. The recent DDoS attack was a ‚Äúproposal for dialogue‚Äù, and innovation was one of the points of the agreement reached.</b> <br>  Difficult to comment due to lack of information. <br><br>  <b>5. An ingenious attempt to destroy the resource from the inside, "bez pylu, bez noise."</b> <br>  Judging by the consequences, the tracker will be deflated in a year or two, if it continues to follow the current path.  So there is such a possibility.  Although this combination is too difficult for the police to act.  Usually, comrades in the form are limited to withdrawing something from the material for examination and other prints. <br><br>  <b>6. Ironically, the cancellation of the rating can even be positive in the sense that the user will not hold a ‚Äúpop‚Äù on the distribution, which is often earned rating, but something really necessary and valuable.</b> <br>  Paradoxically, but for this purpose it would be possible to introduce additional buns (and at the same time to adequately tighten the rules).  So as not to offend fans of pop music, and to avoid the cemetery silence in sections with "rare distributions".  On the other hand, we all know that while the section ‚Äúpenetrated‚Äù and was not placed on a separate site, the rating was raised mainly due to the crack.  And the admins didn‚Äôt care ... Now, half of the new products are banned by the copywriters on the approach, so you don‚Äôt even like to use even pop. <br><br>  <b>7. Attempting to stop the harmful practice of permanently re-registering some users.</b> <br>  To be honest, TRU is the only tracker, probably, whose administration looks completely helpless with regard to multi-checkings, cheating, etc. IMHO, if there is no desire, there are excuses, and if there is a desire, there are ‚Äúsudden‚Äù possibilities.  It seems to me that the administration simply benefits from this state of affairs.  Although I didn‚Äôt go into technical issues, you can also change the tracker engine, introduce additional protection systems against multi-drives, etc. Instead, the admins happily dismissed the group of "anti-cheaters" (and at the same time the Top User group was abolished).  And this, from their point of view, will help bring order to this question?  Oh well‚Ä¶ <br><br>  <b>8. Most likely, here lies another reason that we are afraid to write about.</b> <br>  No Comments. <br><br>  As you can see, the reasons are still covered in darkness.  Perhaps at least after six months the official representative of the TRU on Habr√© will give a clear explanation of what happened ... </div></div><br><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">2. Why did it happen so suddenly?</b> <div class="spoiler_text">  The strangest thing for me personally was the absence of a corresponding topic in the News Tracker - on the main page.  Happy New Year greetings - please, present.  Announcements about the beginning and cancellation of freelich can also be found in the news archive.  Even congratulations on February 23 is.  And for such a turning point for the event tracker, there was no place on the main one ... <br>  In the 1st issue of Rutracker Magazine, by the way, the topic of freelich was touched upon (in an interview with the admin Apic): <br><blockquote>  - Well, now the most terrible and often discussed question: when will the freelich end? <br>  - Weird question :).  Never. <br>  Pachamu? <br>  In general, the main reason for the introduction of such a solution is the constant re-registration of users, after a month about 8% of those who registered were alive and so on a monthly basis.  Those.  of the 100 registered a month later, 92 accounts have already been abandoned.  And without a rating, the number of re-registrations has decreased and quite significantly. </blockquote><br>  Hmm ... Stop.  "Without rating"? .. That is, how?  It seems at the time of the release of the magazine (February 19) the rating was present.  At least opposite the ‚ÄúRating‚Äù item in the profile there were specific numbers instead of the current link. <a href="http://rutracker.org/forum/viewtopic.php%3Ft%3D3956322">Where did the rating go?</a>  .  Freudian slip? </div></div><br><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">3. Why was there no vote?</b> <div class="spoiler_text">  It is clear that for the administration of "voting" - a pure formality.  But for some reason, before the introduction of much less important changes, the admins were not lazy to inquire about the opinions of users, and here, on the contrary, all popular attempts to conduct a ‚Äúopinion poll‚Äù were extinguished at the root ... Mysteriously, really.  After all, the practice of surveys - a common thing for TRU.  It is unwittingly inclined to the fact that "this step had good reasons."  And at the same time it was important for admins that the cancellation of the rating took place in a short time.  But why? .. </div></div><br><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">4. How did the cancellation of the rating affect the life of the TRU?</b> <div class="spoiler_text">  The funny thing is that nothing like has changed in the end.  That is, timbers and just bonuses went into oblivion.  But there was a graph given "on rare" releases.  In general, the statistics table was simply turned on its side for some reason ... <br>  Somehow it is symbolic: the consequences of a hurricane, not otherwise. <br>  And yes!  Taki disappeared rating indicator, which now everyone can calculate himself, dividing the data given in the ‚ÄúGiven‚Äù column to the value of the ‚ÄúDownloaded‚Äù indicator.  One would assume that this was done with the aim of increasing arithmetic literacy among TRU users, but it is hard to believe in it. <br>  In general, nothing has changed, except that now you can download as much as you like without needing to distribute. <br>  By the way, in the 2nd issue of the ‚ÄúRutracker Magazine‚Äù magazine (in an interview with the admin t @ v) the issue of releases was touched: <br><blockquote>  - Why do you like to release? <br>  - Definitely impossible to answer.  He came to torrents.ru mostly for audiobooks.  I started to release when I realized that the rating was falling, but I wanted to download. </blockquote><br>  Wow!  The admin of the TRU at one time to get on the path of the release did not force solidarity, conscience and other philanthropic problems, but the banal need to maintain rating.  Suddenly! <br><br>  The funny thing is that in the same magazine ‚ÄúRutracker Magazine‚Äù (first issue) there is an article ‚ÄúWhy do we create releases?‚Äù Where the plain text of the same Openinest secret is revealed (here it is <b>only the beginning of</b> this article that can be read in its entirety): <br><blockquote>  Have you ever thought about the question: why do people create distributions on torrent trackers?  After all, it is the time and effort spent on searching or creating a material, its design, and siding. <br>  In psychology, there are several key sources of motivation: self-affirmation (status / vanity), competition (envy), pleasure from the process, external circumstances ( <b>eg, rating</b> ), fear, self-development, freedom (independence), belonging (belonging), interest / benefit, power etc <br>  It is very conditionally possible to distinguish four main categories of users of torrent trackers: <br>  1. Freeloader.  His principle - downloaded and dumped, purely consumer approach.  Such people stop the distribution in the client immediately after the download is complete and very rarely create their own distribution.  But the forum posts leave a lot and often flood.  What makes such people still remain in the distribution and create a couple of their own? <br>  The answer is simple - fear and various external causes ( <b>ratings, timburs</b> , bans, bans, etc.).  Unfortunately, ‚Äúfreeloaders‚Äù are becoming more and more, especially after the introduction of freelich on rutracker.org. </blockquote><br><br>  That is, on the one hand, the administration recognizes the importance of the presence of a ‚Äúwhip‚Äù rating, and on the other hand, declares that this is an atavism and an everyday matter.  IMHO, to define this behavior, the term schizophrenia is used. <br><br>  In general, at the moment the rutreker phenomenon could serve as a material for the thesis ‚ÄúTRU as a mirror of network communism‚Äù.  For apparently, the administration believes that the mysterious self-regulation mechanisms and the equally mysterious "conscience" of users will help to preserve the virtual throne of the TRU.  IMHO, the anonymus just laughs like this on the Web interface. <br><br>  I remember three or four years ago, if acquaintances had to find not information, but content, they could be easily redirected not to Google Search, but to TRU.  Because if there was no book or film on the TRU, then with a 99% probability they could not be found in runet at all.  Now the situation has changed a lot.  Yes, yes, earlier and the sun was shining brighter, and the grass was greener, I know.  But nonetheless.  According to my subjective observations, the number of new releases is steadily decreasing. <br>  To demonstrate the consequences of canceling a rating, I‚Äôll just provide screenshots of distributions from not the most popular TRU sections.  At the same time, the screenshots present new items of the respective sections ( <u>releases are ordered by the time of placement</u> ).  I confess that I never watched such a depressing picture: only a few sit, some of the hands die at all ... <br>  <a href=""><b>Experimental (lossy)</b></a> <br>  <a href=""><b>Documentary films and TV shows ¬ªCinema</b></a> <br>  <a href=""><b>Indian Ethnic Music (lossless)</b></a> <br><br>  By the moderators there are more questions about maintaining a banal order on the forum.  If earlier they probably did not have enough time to remove the mat and advertising spam (simply because they had to check a bunch of new hands every day).  What they are doing now is a mystery ... <br>  Moreover, the forum recently observed a decline in activity.  Only topics that are modestly placed in the section ‚ÄúFor communication between users of other resources‚Äù flourish: <br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/268/558/85a/26855885ae533aaf495201d41fb80978.jpg"></a> <br></div></div><br><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">5. What awaits TRU in the future?</b> <div class="spoiler_text">  In principle, several years ago it became obvious that the TRU reached its peak (in the form in which it existed) and that some changes are needed to correct the vector of resource development.  Akin to the revision of management in a startup that has reached the size of a corporation.  At first glance it may seem that the administration of the TRU is making gestures towards greater openness and lowering the threshold of accessibility of the tracker.  But all such changes at the level of the rules are broken about the outdated principles of moderation and pre-moderation.  When countless carping to the design and other "following the letter" (recall at least the story of placing the series "Stage" / "The.Scene" in the section <b>"Miscellaneous" Miscellaneous "Video</b> ) kill the desire to release.  Already, the number of new books laid out on the root-tracker has dropped significantly.  If earlier on <a href="http://www.mirknig.com/">www.mirknig.com</a> , for example, there were completely overflows with TRU, now God forbid that at least a tenth of the new products should be transferred from the ‚Äúworld of books‚Äù ... <br><br>  Summing up, we can say the following: the TRU is increasingly approaching a kind of network analogue of the library ‚Äúspecial storage‚Äù (with Russian specifics).  New items appear later than on competing sites (or do not appear at all).  Distributions are closed by left holders.  Plus - the encouraged ideology of "hit and run" flourishes. <br><br>  IMHO, there are several options for the future rutrekera. <br><br>  <b>1. A highly specialized archive (a la museum reserve release).</b> <br>  This is not the worst option.  New products in the network enough.  But old television broadcasts, art house rarities and other things that are not necessary for the ordinary user can not be found outside the TRU.  Downloading such exclusives on the rutracker was often difficult, and now even more so.  But still there is a chance to reach the release (if not banned) or the lucky ones who had time to stock up at the best of times, and ask to return to the distribution.  If the rutracker administrators direct their efforts to preserve rare materials, everyone will benefit.  Yes, the TRU will have to abandon the image of the ‚Äútracker all root‚Äù, but at least it will not accumulate at all. <br><br>  <b>2. Platform in the network for those in power.</b> <br>  Why?  There will be ‚Äúthe author's distribution‚Äù of commercials of the ruling party.  Or, if not so thickly, logging of release movements by the competent authorities is for the future.  For a long time, there have been suspicions that the TRU cooperates not only with the copiers.  First, the explanatory attachment to the ".ru" zone (which is especially strange after the events with the cutting out of the domain torrents.ru, after which uniongang and tfile, for example, immediately moved to the .TV and .me zones, respectively).  Then - the mysterious phrase of the admin in an interview with the magazine ‚ÄúRutracker Magazine‚Äù (number 02): <br><blockquote>  - Rutreker survived a lot: a change of domain, ddos, a fire in the data center, hacks, etc., and always solved problems quickly enough, within a few days, what is the secret of such vitality? <br>  - I have certain considerations on this matter, but, they are not for publication. </blockquote><br><br>  Again, let us recall the opening of the ‚ÄúPirate Party‚Äù representation on the TRU, which, against the background of every kind of deflection, looks like a few ... ahem‚Ä¶ inconsistently.  But some people have a great opportunity for all kinds of ‚Äústuffing‚Äù and other provocations. <br><br>  <b>3. Something third.</b> <br>  As you know, the administration of the resource suffers from suddenness.  Therefore, for the trick waiting for users tomorrow - nobody knows.  Perhaps the tracker will try to reanimate the next outlandish way.  We'll see... </div></div><br><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Add.</b>  <b class="spoiler_title">materials</b> <div class="spoiler_text">  <b>Screenlist</b> <br>  Here I was going to provide a split into several categories (to which most of the comments could be attributed) ‚Äúreport in screenshots‚Äù.  But I realized that the action would be redundant: the archive of the discussion is still in place.  And to make screenshots just for the sake of the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãcreating a post as a release ... at least laziness. <br>  Yes, and accusations of bias to me to anything.  Everyone can make their own conclusions on the basis of personal observations, IMHO. <br><br>  <b>Links</b> <br><h3>  1.

So, what do the observations of curriculum vitae rutracker.org give us? </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">First, under the conditions of increasing copywriting pressure, the ‚Äúclassic‚Äù (tracker) p2p-file sharing takes up its positions. There are several reasons. Here are the main, IMHO: </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">1. It is difficult to hide the identity of the owners of the tracker. After all, hosting and other things need money. Trackers that exist solely due to some kind of anonymous patron, I do not know. Accordingly, donat (or advertising) is needed. And this means that financial strings will stretch, which in the end will lead to the owners. And </font></font><a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/150879/"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">as practice shows</font></font></a><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">, you can get them from anywhere. Here it would be possible to recall the alternative methods of payment. Cryptocurrency, etc. But these systems are unlikely to get widespread - judging by the systematic discredit Bitcoin (see </font></font><a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/151034/"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">another example</font></font></a><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> ). </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">2. In the ‚Äúclassic‚Äù p2p-file sharing scheme there is a weak link - the site, which is also a torrent tracker. It can be zaddosit, hack, stop the delegation of the domain name, etc. </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">These two points are already missing the head, IMHO. Are there any options? In my opinion, survivable others will be really closed trackers, information about the very existence of which will fall into the field of view of the left owners in the last place. Again, you can recall </font></font><a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/BitTorrent"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">trackerless systems</font></font></a><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> .</font></font><br><br>    ,      <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/EDonkey2000_(%25D1%2581%25D0%25B5%25D1%2582%25D1%258C)">eD2k</a> .          <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%2590%25D0%25BD%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B8%25D0%25BC%25D0%25BD%25D1%258B%25D0%25B5_%25D1%2581%25D0%25B5%25D1%2582%25D0%25B8">     </a> <br><br> ,     . ,      -,      ‚Ä¶ <br><br> <b><i></i></b> <br> <code>&lt; offtop&gt;</code> <br>   ,              ‚Ä¶ <br>  Why?<font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">It is no secret that there is a closed forum for owners of lychek and other "titles." Could they agree and turn off the cover operation (cancellation of the rating), and themselves on the sly to go to several previously created secret specialized trackers. These trackers, literally closed, are almost impossible to get on. Handouts materials are gradually laid out on other trackers, for which there is a special team of conspiratorial "messengers". On TRU they release too. But only in order to maintain the visibility of the life of the resource. The scenario provides for the gradual death of the tracker "from natural causes." Problems with left owners, special services, etc. will also disappear automatically. But the content will live ... </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Yes, my fantasy is wild =). </font></font><code>&lt;/ offtop&gt;</code> <br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">On this </font><i><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">mystical</font></i><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> optic</font></font><i><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"></font></i><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">note my amateurish reasoning breaks off. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">I did not understand the technical issues, did not go into details. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">This is just a look from the point of view of the average person - a regular tracker user. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">And the post was written rather for the same users who are hardly registered on Habr√©. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">But now they have a chance to read interesting comments (which I really hope) of professionals, that is, you, dear habrovchane. </font></font><br><br> <b><i><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">ZZY The</font></font></i></b> <br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> dubious beauty of ‚Äúclearance for release‚Äù meant viewing on a regular monitor (with an aspect ratio of 5: 4). </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">How it looks on widescreen monitors and gadgets can not even imagine. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Therefore, I apologize in advance (more precisely, belatedly) for a bit of extravagance - possibly at the expense of readability.</font></font><br><div class="spoiler"> <b class="spoiler_title"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">ZZYY</font></font></b> <div class="spoiler_text"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/3c5/28d/49a/3c528d49ad3036705cc4f0ea6efa1762.gif" alt="image"></div></div></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/150843/">https://habr.com/ru/post/150843/</a></p>
