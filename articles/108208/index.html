  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Facebook Messages</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Imagine a family that you can see in modern American comedy: loving parents are trying to communicate with a teenager, absorbed in text messaging, a child who is always online in the chat, and various foolish relatives writing "funny" letters to the family. <br><br>  Of course, this is an exaggerated stereotype, but this is what we see every day in the cinema, on TV and in advertising, since most of us in part relate to this.  With the help of mobile devices and the Internet, we can be connected today more than ever before, but still there is a feeling that technology can also act as a barrier between us.  When I want to write something to someone, it should be as simple as defining who I want to write and what I want to write.  It should feel like a human conversation. <br><br>  Today I am pleased to present a new generation of messages.  You decide how you want to talk to your friends: via SMS, chat, email or Messages.  They will receive your messages through any medium or device convenient for them, and together you can have a conversation in real time.  You do not have to remember who prefer instant messengers to email or worry about which technologies to use.  Simply select the desired name and message type. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  We also provide a <a href="http://geektimes.ru/users/facebook/" class="user_link">facebook</a> .com email address for everyone.  Now people can chat with friends via email, whether they are on Facebook or not.  To be clear, Messages are not email.  There is no subject, no cc, no bcc in the Messages, you can send a message just by pressing Enter.  We modeled them so that it was more like a chat, and reduced the number of things you have to do to send a message.  We wanted it to be more like a conversation.

All your messages with someone will be in the same place, regardless of whether they were written in chat, by e-mail or via SMS.  You can see everything that you have been discussing with each other as one conversation. <br><br>  I strongly envy the next generation, who will have Facebook throughout their lives.  They will have a history of messages from the very beginning of life.  With ‚Äúnice to meet you" to "do not want to drink coffee somehow?" And to "our kids have a football training today at 6".  This is a really cool idea. <br><br>  It seems wrong that the email from your best friend is located between the account and the bank statement.  Not that other messages are not important, but some of them are more significant.  With new messages, your inbox will contain only messages from your friends and their friends.  All other messages will be sent to other folders where you can read them separately. <br><br>  If someone you know is not on Facebook, that person‚Äôs email will first be sent to another folder.  You can easily move it to your inbox, and all future conversations with it will be displayed there. <br><br><img src="http://sphotos.ak.fbcdn.net/hphotos-ak-snc4/hs943.snc4/73601_10150101075186729_20531316728_7115674_2984967_n.jpg"><br><br>  You can also change your account settings to be even more limited and only accept from your friends in incoming messages. <br><br>  This type of message control is rather unprecedented, and people have long wanted to do this with email (and phone calls).  Messages change the way to prevent unwanted contacts.  Instead of worrying about spreading your email address, you can now control who can truly contact you. <br><br>  Relatively soon, we all will probably stop using arbitrary ten numbers and a strange string of characters to communicate with each other.  We will simply select friends by name and will be able to contact them immediately.  We have not reached this point yet, but today's changes are a small first step. <br><br>  We will launch Messages and email addresses gradually and make them available to everyone over the next few months.  Once you receive an invitation, you can start using it and also invite friends to join you. <br><br>  <i>Joel Seligstin, a Facebook engineer, is glad that he no longer needs to remember which friends prefer text messages, which ones email, and which ones chat.</i> <br><hr><br>  Request for an invite can be left here: <a href="http://www.facebook.com/about/messages/">facebook.com/about/messages/</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/108208/">https://habr.com/ru/post/108208/</a></p>
