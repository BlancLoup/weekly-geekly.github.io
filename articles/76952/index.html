  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Effective employee - no cog</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  In order to work effectively, a person must clearly know that he is a great fellow, that his decisions are important for the company and correct.  Most people work ‚Äúunder the command‚Äù, i.e.  on the one hand, they execute commands all the time, and on the other, they are forced to coordinate their every step. <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  How can you realize your own importance if you are a robot, if you are not trusted?  Yes, the golden rule of a good boss should be "Trust, but verify."  They just do not trust.  This is easier.  Each of the managers is sure that he knows the best, and the people who work for him are the mechanism he manages.  On the other hand, he himself is a cog in a more complex machine, he himself coordinates his steps and reports on what he has done, preparing to take the next position and get a new cartridge and new cogs.  This is tin. <br><br>  It turns out that all the so-called ‚Äúmanagers‚Äù are doing nothing but striving to become the next level cog, ‚Äúpumping‚Äù.  It's like the key for nineteen will dream of becoming the key for twenty-two.  The question is, what then tighten the "nineteenth" nuts?

      This is complete bullshit.  What to do?  Allow people to do what they are paid for.  One big company where I once worked forced the head of the distribution department to coordinate with the management lists of distribution points - each point.  Firstly, the time gap was spent on this.  Secondly, it infuriated the distribution manager.  Do you know what happened?  Yes!  Publications of the company were extremely bad, and the manager was a great guy and a great professional, he quit nafig and now serves in an even larger publishing house where he is trusted. <br><br>  Coordination of steps and descending instructions from above are the khan of employee motivation.  Man, by definition, does not want to be a cog, but wants to be a person.  He wants to control, but he has to command.  Why?  Who makes him?  System!  His boss commands - and he will when he becomes the boss.  Unraveled!  Commanders must command, and managers must rule! <br><br>  Why not entrust people with the work for which you pay them?  If you have recruited a classroom personnel specialist, an excellent marketer, a super sales manager, why should you coordinate his every step?  You do not trust him?  Then why did you take it to work?  It is necessary that each person at each level would do his work himself ‚Äî report on the results, and not coordinate every step.  Wrong - explain.  Yes, such a mistake, perhaps, will cost the company money, perhaps a lot.  Consider this an investment in employee training.  A good employee, having made a mistake, will try to improve, become better.  What does "and if he is not good" mean?  Why did you take it to work, bad such? <br><br>  Well, of course, when the business works "like a clock."  Bad when it starts to show time. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/76952/">https://habr.com/ru/post/76952/</a></p>
