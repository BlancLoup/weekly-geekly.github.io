  <section class="page js-page"><h1>New Garmin: for dogs, thrill-seekers and motorists</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"> Garmin introduced a number of new products that will be the basis of its lineup in 2014.  It is worth noting that there are no classic navigators among them: first, the time of these devices is gradually leaving (hello to smartphones and tablets with GPS), secondly, it is considered inappropriate to focus on them during the Russian presentation at Garmin.  (About the reasons we previously wrote in the blog Smartgadget). <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/353/14d/693/35314d693b2dc6b01f7e4c73f53e5407.jpg"><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  The first line includes devices for dog training.  The first - BarkLimiter: it is fixed on the collar and allows you to wean the dog from the untimely barking.  The latter is calculated immediately and the sound, and the movements of the larynx.

On some dogs, they, however, do not act, but the vast majority of barking uselessly wean.  And after months, the need for a device disappears.  It costs about 4 thousand rubles. <br><br>  Well, I'd add on my own that I would like to see such ‚Äúbarking limiters‚Äù not only for big dogs, but also for small dogs.  They usually spoil the "sound background" much stronger ... True, hardly grandmothers - the typical owners of such sonorous dogs - will bother with high-tech collars.  They are already satisfied with everything. <br><br>  We go further.  Garmin Delta models simplify dog ‚Äã‚Äãtraining, "allowing the owner to remotely influence the animal and fixing reflexes and reactions to commands."  There are two models here, Garmin Delta and Garmin Delta Sport (the BarkLimiter is also supplied with the latter, among other things).  The devices work as follows: a collar with a special module is hung on the dog's neck, and the owner has a remote with an LCD screen in his hands.  From it you can choose the type of impact on the animal, depending on the situation, type of training or behavior of the dog: it can be sound, vibration or discharge current of varying intensity and duration. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/444/1d9/76d/4441d976d83015994b07528e941ca46c.jpg"><br>  Garmin delta <br><br>  Again - a useful thing, but not cheap: 10-12 thousand.  However, this is not a reproach in the direction of Garmin, but simply the thought that keeping and training a large dog is a rather expensive process.  However, he brings pleasure decently. <br><br>  Garmin DC50 is, again, a collar, but complete with it is no longer a simple console, but a Garmin Astro 320 tourist navigator. In total, they are the control system for hunting dogs.  Up to 10 collars can be connected to one navigator;  thus, you can find out your location and understand where the little dogs run (within a radius of up to 14 and a half kilometers).  The price of the set is almost 37 thousand rubles. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/7f7/062/5a5/7f70625a54bc79ba9d5767d4d3ace7e0.jpg"><br>  Garmin Astro 320 + DC50 <br><br>  Dog theme gradually comes to an end, and DVRs begin.  While he is alone, namely Garmin GDR 35. I have already mentioned in my previous posts, I repeat here: if the high prices for accessories for dogs are completely understandable, since they are unique in a certain sense, then offer twin recorders Mio for 11 thousand rubles - this, of course, is quite presumptuous.  Let him even with GPS, the ability to alert about the radar and the support of the second camera.  Analogs from Russian brands cost thousands of 5. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/c35/59c/8f2/c3559c8f250bcea8b3ee5d1e230ae319.jpg"><br>  Garmin GDR 35 <br><br>  Garmin Virb is not a recorder, but an extreme camera with Full HD 1080p recording.  There will be two versions - with GPS and Wi-Fi support, and also without these modules.  A positive point is the support of the ANT + protocol, which allows you to organize control from the Edge cycle computers, Fenix ‚Äã‚Äãwatches, Oregon manual navigators, and so on.  For serious extreme all this, I think, will come in handy.  And minus the following: Garmin Virb is suitable for short dives, but you can't seriously dive with the camera.  For swimming at a depth of 50 meters, a box is required, which is not included.  The price of the camera is from 14 thousand rubles, the option with a cycle fastening costs 15.5. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/b89/6f5/af5/b896f5af57ffa4a3306b91c38c431533.jpg"><br>  Garmin virb <br><br>  Garmin HUD for 8 thousand rubles - this is a projection display.  It displays information about the direction of the next maneuver, the recommended lane for movement, the distance to the next maneuver, arrival time, current speed, current speed limit, etc. All this is done on the device running iOS (Android and Windows applications will be released later) . <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/8b5/87d/b12/8b587db128c3d4b48d239edeca018eac.jpg"><br>  Garmin hud <br><br>  The projection of the image can be carried out both on the windshield of the car (it is necessary to stick a special film) and on the transparent shield-reflector, which is installed on the projector.  In general, if you saw something similar in some BMW and were impressed, but you still have Ford Focus, you can buy a HUD. <br><br>  Well and the last - the Garmin Monterra navigator on Android.  Both externally and according to its capabilities, it resembles a smartphone: 4-inch screen, 8-megapixel camera, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth and NFC ... Of unusual - ANT + support, of unusual for smartphones - a bunch of pre-installed Garmin software and partners.  Yes, the possibility of making calls is not enough, but, apparently, Garmin has turned away from smartphones well in times of cooperation with ASUS.  The price is not yet known. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/181/5d0/4a7/1815d04a7b5877b37931442b544bf725.png"><br>  Garmin monterra <br><br>  What do you think about new products?  In my opinion, Garmin got a good update of the line, although, of course, it would be better for them not to go into the recorder segment.  Moreover, the rest of the niches, and not without interest, enough. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/210852/">https://habr.com/ru/post/210852/</a></p>
