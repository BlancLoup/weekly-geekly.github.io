Today I will tell you a short story about how I took the path of a programmer.  This is my story and you can‚Äôt change it anymore, but if it helps even one person to become a little more confident, then it was told not in vain. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/1l/zq/ea/1lzqeascggz5pizg-inlljane1s.jpeg"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h3>  Prologue </h3><br>  Let's start with the fact that I was not keen on programming from an early age, like many readers of this article.  I, like any dolt, always wanted something rebellious.  As a child I adored climbing climbing games and playing computer games (which gave me a lot of problems with my parents).

      Being in the 9th grade, all I wanted was to get rid of the all-seeing parental eye as soon as possible and finally ‚Äúlive in a high‚Äù.  But what does this mean, this notorious "live in a high"?  At that time, I thought it was a carefree life without worries, when I could play games for days without reproaches from my parents.  My teenage nature did not know who she wanted to become in the future, but the direction of IT was close in spirit.  With that, I adored movies about hackers, it added courage. <br><br>  Therefore, it was decided to go to college.  Of all that I was most interested in and was in the list of areas, it was only programming.  I thought: ‚ÄúAnd what, I will spend more time at the computer, and the computer = games.‚Äù <br><br><h3>  College </h3><br>  I even studied the first course, but we had no more subjects related to programming than birches at the North Pole.  From the sheer feeling of hopelessness, I threw everything in my second year (I was miraculously not expelled for an ANNUAL walk).  We were not taught anything interesting, I got acquainted with the bureaucratic machine, <s>or she with me</s> and understood how to get the marks correctly.  From the subjects, at least indirectly related to programming, we had ‚ÄúComputer Architecture‚Äù, which for 2.5 years had 2.5 pairs, and also ‚ÄúFundamentals of Programming‚Äù, on which we wrote 2-line programs on BASIC.  I note that after the 2nd course I studied perfectly well (with a hot parental hand).  How I resented and shook, saying: ‚ÄúWe are not taught anything, how can we become programmers?  It's all about the education system, we just had no luck. ‚Äù <br><br>  It came from my mouth every day, to every person who asked me about my studies. <br>  After graduating from college, having written a thesis on the subject of a DBMS and a hundred lines on VBA, I gradually began to reach it.  The very process of writing a diploma was hundreds of times more valuable than all 4 years of study.  It was a very strange feeling. <br><br>  After releasing me, I didn‚Äôt even think that I could ever become a programmer.  I always thought it was an impossible sphere with a bunch of headaches.  ‚ÄúYou need to be a genius to write programs!‚Äù, It was written on my face. <br><br><h3>  University </h3><br>  Then the university began.  When I enrolled in the ‚ÄúSoftware Automation‚Äù direction, I had even more reasons to shout about the terrible education system, because even there they didn‚Äôt teach us anything.  Teachers followed the path of least resistance, and if you could type 10 lines of code from a leaf on the keyboard, they gave a positive assessment and were removed as a cup of coffee to the teacher. <br><br>  Here I want to say that I began to experience overt hatred for the education system.  I thought I should be given knowledge.  Why did I come here then?  Or maybe it's me so close up that my maximum is 20 thousand per month and socks for the new year. <br>  Now it is fashionable to be a programmer, everyone is admired by you, mentioned in a conversation, like: "... and do not forget. He is a programmer, it speaks for itself." <br>  From what I wanted, but could not be, I reproached myself constantly.  Slowly, I began to reconcile with my nature and thought less and less about it. ‚ÄúNothing, have I ever been distinguished by any particular mindset?  I was not praised at school, well, okay, not everyone is destined. ‚Äù <br><br>  While studying at the university, I got a job as a salesman, and my life was relatively calm, and the desired ‚Äúlive in a high‚Äù never came.  The toys didn‚Äôt disturb the mind this way, they didn‚Äôt run about the bugs, and some kind of longing appeared in the soul.  Once a buyer came to me, he was smartly dressed, he had a cool car.  I asked, they say: ‚ÄúWhat is the secret?  What are you doing? ‚Äù <br><br>  This guy turned out to be a programmer.  Word for word, the conversation started up on the topic of programming, I started whining my old song about education, and this man put an end to my razdolbaysky nature. <br><br>  ‚ÄúNo teacher can teach you something without your desire and sacrifice.  Learning is a self-learning process, and teachers only put you on the right rails and periodically lubricate the pads.  If it is easy for you during your studies, then know that something is definitely going wrong.  You came to the university for knowledge, so take heart and take them! ‚ÄùHe said to me.  This man has ignited in me that weak, barely smoldering ember, which has almost gone out. <br><br>  It dawned on me that all my surroundings, including myself, simply decomposed behind a screen of naked black humor and tales of the untold wealth that await us in the future.  This is not only my problem, but also the problem of all young people.  We are a generation of dreamers, and many of us do not know how to do anything but dream of bright and beautiful things.  Walking along the path of procrastination, we quickly knock down standards for our lifestyle.  Instead of a trip to Turkey - a trip to the dacha, there is no money to move to your favorite city - nothing, and in our village there is also a monument to Lenin, and the car no longer seems such a wreck.  I understood why the "live in the buzz" still has not come. <br><br>  That same day I came home and began to learn the basics of programming.  It turned out to be so interesting that nothing could satisfy my greed, I wanted more and more.  Nothing has ever fascinated me so far; I have been busy for days on end, in free and non-free time.  The data structures, algorithms, programming paradigms, patterns (which I didn‚Äôt understand at the time) all flowed into my head in an endless stream.  I slept for 3 hours a day and I dreamed of sorting algorithms, ideas of various software architectures and just a wonderful life where I can enjoy my work, where I will finally ‚Äúlive in a high‚Äù.  The unreachable Ultima Thule has already seemed beyond the horizon and my life has gained meaning again. <br><br>  Having worked in the store for some time, I began to notice that all the young people are just as insecure guys.  They could make an effort over themselves, but preferred to relaxedly content themselves with what they had, deliberately giving up their unfulfilled desires. <br><br>  I tried to combine work and study with the university.  After I had an interest in the profession, the teachers began, with a clear desire to tell me some subtleties of the profession, I liked to discuss with them.  Of course there were a lot of things that I did not understand from the word "absolutely."  At such moments my hands dropped, I again began to think that this was ‚Äúnot mine.‚Äù  But time passed, I returned to the same tasks and voila!  Everything was elementary. <br><br>  I managed to find a company of guys like myself who are unsure of themselves who are trying to achieve something.  We helped each other, competed, collected all kinds of drones and robots, programmed ‚Äúsmart‚Äù houses to our friends.  We did everything that brought us almost no money.  There I began to specifically lean towards C # and C ++.  Why?  Yes, simply because I liked to make cool and beautiful applications (I used WPF), and to work with controllers like Arduine or STM. <br>  I didn‚Äôt try to get a job as a programmer, because I understood that it would be difficult to combine with the university, but at that time I liked being there.  However, one of my friends recommended me to one start-up project, where we worked on a system for monitoring temperatures in the tank.  We hired students to make the development cheaper, as I understand it.  It would be just stupid to refuse, the money for me was very good and I wanted a constant movement.  After that, other entrepreneurs began to contact me, although I did not post a resume.  I think it's all about the word of mouth. <br>  After a couple of years, I have already written some really useful programs, have been well integrated into several projects by the developer, have gained experience and even more charged on further development. <br><br><h3>  Epilogue </h3><br>  There is a belief that if you do something regularly for a certain period of time, then this ‚Äúsomething‚Äù will become a habit.  Self-study is no exception.  I learned to learn independently, to find a solution to my tasks without outside help, to quickly obtain information and practically use it.  Now it‚Äôs hard for me not to write at least one line of code per day.  When you learn to program, your mind is rebuilt, you begin to look at the world from a different angle and differently assess what is happening around.  You learn to decompose difficult tasks into small simple subtasks.  Crazy thoughts come to your head about how you can arrange anything, and it will work better.  Perhaps this is why many people think that programmers are ‚Äúnot of this world.‚Äù <br><br>  Now they have taken me to a large firm that develops automation and fault-tolerant systems.  I feel fear, but with it I feel faith in myself and in my own strength.  Life is given once, and in the end I want to know that I have contributed to this world.  The story that an individual creates is much more important than the personality itself. <br><br>  What a delight to me still brings words of gratitude from people who use my software.  For a programmer, there is nothing more valuable than pride in their projects, because they are the embodiment of our efforts.  My life is full of wonderful moments, ‚Äúliving in a high‚Äù came to my street, I began to wake up with pleasure in the mornings, I began to take care of my health and really breathe deeply. <br><br>  In this article I want to say that the first and most important instance of education is the student himself.  In the process of self-learning lies the process of self-knowledge, sometimes thorny, but yielding its fruits.  The main thing is not to give up and believe that sooner or later the most irresistible the distant "live in a high" will come. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/457294/">https://habr.com/ru/post/457294/</a></p>
