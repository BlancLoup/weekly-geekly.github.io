I still continue to work in a large IT company as a duty administrator.  In the day duty was born the continuation of the story. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  <b>NIICHOSHI.</b>  <b>Saday</b> <br>  (System Administrator Day - System Administrator Day) <br><br>  - Yes, leave me alone!  - the cat persistently poked his face into my face.  The alarm has not yet rang.  I opened one eye.  The clock was 6:55.  Here is an infection!  I could have been sleeping for another five minutes.  Seeing my cat's open eye, he added sound signals to his actions. <br><br>  - Yes to you!  - another second and black fluffy screaming mass was on the floor.  I got up and headed to the bathroom.  Cat Byte (or Byte the cat) followed me, not losing sight of.  On the way, I removed a couple of bits from his tray.  In the bathroom, looking at myself in the mirror, I proudly combed my three-centimeter sisadminskaya beard.  For more than a year I have been working as a duty officer at NIICHOSI (Research Institute for Private Objects of Information Systems) in the administration department of the data center.  It seems that my experience is growing along with a beard, perhaps I will not shave it ...

      - Meow, me ... kh, phe.  - it seems that the cat is hoarse and now has begun to make sounds similar to the dial-up modem connection. <br><br>  - Now.  Wait for you.  - I poured him food.  Strange sounds emanating from the cat, subsided and he connected to the bowl.  I also had a quick snack, got dressed and moved to work. <br><br>  Today was the last Friday of July.  Today was the day of the System Administrator.  Today I was on duty again. <br><br>  It turned out this way over the past year that I constantly received watch for holidays.  New Year, February 23, March 8, May 1 and 9, and today.  Experienced admins from our department say that this day always goes smoothly and relaxed.  Nothing serious is ever planned.  Inspired by the feeling of carelessness, I went to NIICHOSI.  He greeted the guard.  Strangely, something painfully formally he is dressed - really in honor of the holiday?  I looked at my watch, I still had half an hour before the watch began.  I decided to run into the technical support department to my friend Pavel.  We met with him on that <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/post/306562/">fateful New Year's Eve</a> , when I had my first combat night duty.  Then he unsuccessfully began to celebrate the New Year.  Fortunately, the electric shock did not cause serious damage, but rather the opposite - the light burr passed without a trace, and he liked the hair that had risen with a stake so much that Pashka decided to make himself a mohawk and walks with it, to this day. <br><br>  I found him in the rest room on the fifth floor. <br><br>  - Hello.  Why not for the "machine"?  I asked Paul, pouring himself some coffee. <br><br>  - Hello, Sanya!  Yes, that's a dream tends, I'm with the night.  Another half an hour and all.  For a moment came off.  And the client is kind of nervous in the morning.  Like Friday ... Well, come to me. <br><br>  We got to his workplace.  Pavel sat down, put on his headset and noted his readiness to receive calls in the system.  His desk was quite narrow; there was only a monitor, a keyboard and a mouse.  On the right and on the left it was separated by walls from other tables, behind which were also the workplaces of technical support staff.  Behind his monitor was hanging that unfortunate "trophy" power filter with traces of his teeth on the wire. <br><br>  - Oh, look, more precisely, listen, as I will deal with him!  - in the headphones Paul rang the incoming call.  - NIICHOSHI, tech support Pavel, I listen.  Hello.  Yes.  Yes.  Not.  Can not.  Can I still help you?  Good.  And you as well.  And you there too.  Goodbye. <br><br>  Pavel pressed the end button. <br><br>  - M-yes.  I said they were nervous.  Well, with the following just get lucky.  And here is the call.  NIICHOSHI, tech support Pavel, I listen.  Yes, how do I know if there are pokemons in your city?  Let me better ... <br><br>  I did not bother him and went to his workplace.  In addition, soon have to intercede on duty.  I just got to the elevator, as my phone was buzzing in my pocket. <br><br>  - Where are you wearing?  - the voice of the boss was not childishly stern.  - You throw it to me, why not yet in place? <br><br>  Hmm, I'm straight, I caught a feeling of deja vu.  My nerves tightened a little at the recollection of that night duty. <br><br>  - Evgeny Palych, now I will, I am already coming down! <br><br>  I went down to the second floor and went to the glass door of our office.  Something suspicious.  Our department was almost at full strength.  Is it all gathered for the holiday?  Anton - he was on duty at night today, and I had to change him - I was sitting at my computer, with my head in my hands.  Yes, he has already been working here for more than ten years, and as a bonus he is allowed to take a nap for ten minutes on duty.  Micah, Max and Brain are located near the table of Evgeny Pavlovich and discussed something.  Even the sysadmins Kostya, Potap and Kirill sat nearby and diligently ‚Äúprepared‚Äù some kind of server. <br><br>  I went into the office.  At the sound of the door peeped from my pass, everyone (except for the night duty officer) simultaneously turned their heads and stared at me.  I felt uneasy ... <br><br>  - And here is our duty officer came.  There is another five minutes before your duty begins.  We will hold a small planning meeting.  Sit down  - Evgeny Pavlovich pointed to an empty chair at his desk.  - Kostya, Potap, Cyril, too, let's come here. <br><br>  The system administrators in unison picked up the server that they gutted, dragged them closer and continued their work. <br><br>  - First, congratulations, colleagues, on the holiday.  Secondly, in fact, why I gathered you all.  Going to us ... <br><br>  His words were interrupted by light snoring of the night duty officer. <br><br>  - Anton, and your server fell!  - Max shouted slightly.  The attendant sharply raised his head and began to frantically peer into the window of the monitoring system. <br><br>  - Yah you.  Everything works fine.  Oh, Sasha, hello.  Come on, take the watch.  I want to sleep. <br><br>  His eyes began to stick together again. <br><br>  - So, Anton!  You have five minutes to watch, be patient.  - Evgeny Pavlovich reproachfully looked at the person on duty.  - So, today we will come to check.  As you know, and who does not know - a minus to him for not being curious - we have a large investor from China.  At one time they decently invested in the creation of our NIIChOS.  Why do they need it?  The income from our organization for them is small.  But who will understand them.  And today, a representative from their company, Hu Wa Ping, is visited by engineer Li Hua. <br><br>  - Aha, don't wake Lee Hua, while it is quiet!  - Potap spoke up, not looking up from picking in the motherboard of the server. <br><br>  - Yes, and all the words of the name of their company are not finished ... - Kostya supported him. <br><br>  - Come on, stop talking.  It's all serious.  Though he will not understand you - he does not speak Russian at all, but fortunately there will be a translator with him.  Our translator is Russian, he understands humor.  And now, actually go to the reason for his arrival.  They got an idea to check if everything works correctly for us.  If, as a result of the check, their engineer leaves with a positive report and mood, then all is well.  If he does not like something, he finds some shortcomings - then ALL OF US ARE FIRED, PLEASED, AND SEND HERE TO OUR EMPLOYEES FOR SERVICE !!!  - it was noticeable how Yevgeny Pavlovich was nervous.  Yes, it seems, everything was very serious. <br><br>  - Tonight, Boris Mikhalych gathered an emergency meeting on this issue.  It was decided: today we leave the full composition.  In the morning, we clean up all the jambs in the system.  Testing will begin with our department, then this Chinese will smoothly switch to programmers.  Just in case, Robert Mikhailovich, out of harm's way, was sent on an urgent "business trip."  In Norilsk, suppose.  Most of the programmers went on vacation for a couple of days.  Left only the most "straight-handed."  So Alexander is on your exemplary duty.  In the case of even the smallest problems - you raise everyone.  All the rest we correct shoals, check the relevance of the documentation, etc., etc., etc. Kostya, Potap, Kirill connect the Brain, uh, that is Anton, and understand these twenty red triggers in monitoring, by the arrival of the test. <br><br>  - But Yevgeny Pavlovich!  Where do we get more space for partitions, and even a dozen combat servers always stomps on the load - is this their normal state during working hours !? <br><br>  - So, the tasks are set, solve.  I'm at a meeting!  - said Yevgeny Pavlovich and left.  There was silence in the office.  Only I could hear the noise of computers and the squeaking of a bespereboinik somewhere behind the wall. <br><br>  - Here is a tricky one!  We rake, and he runs around to meetings.  We know these meetings.  In your holiday and do not relax on the normal!  - Kostya was outraged. <br><br>  - Darn!  Hike now the battery will die on the bespereboynik.  And test benches are connected to it.  SchA as everything will be cut out - they will develop.  - Potap said and rushed to his office. <br><br>  ‚ÄúWhy did the uninterrupted power supply work?‚Äù  Like the electricity did not turn off?  - I asked. <br><br>  - Yes, he is testing how long this battery will last under such a load.  Strange of course, but yesterday he was completely bored.  - Cyril explained. <br><br>  - Hey, duty officer.  Let's get on duty already!  - sleepy Anton was about to leave. <br><br>  I sat down at my working comp.  Unsubscribed in the general chat that took over duty.  Anton with peace of mind "crawled away" from the office.  It was calm now.  Everything worked fine, only on the corporate messaging service there were some queues.  I looked in the admin panel - Anton already wrote to developers on this issue, where he explained to them in an accessible and popular way where their hands grow from and what parameters should be in the send delay settings.  Those promised to fix in the next build. <br><br>  There was a slight smell of coffee in the office.  Everyone was busy with something.  Kostya and Kirill continued to pick a server, for some reason in our office.  Something they could not cram into a new motherboard. <br><br>  - Bone, what are you picking?  What will this piece of iron be for?  - I asked. <br><br>  - Yes, we have an idea, for the time of the test, attach this jersey instead of ... <br><br>  His words were interrupted by a phone call on my desk. <br><br>  - NIICHOSHI, the administrator on duty Alexander, I listen.  - as always, I answered the rules. <br><br>  - Hello.  This is Olga Borisovna, your chief accountant.  You do not know where our valiant system administrators?  Nobody picks up the phone from them, just got through to you.  And the question of life or death ... their salaries! <br><br>  - Hello, Olga Borisovna.  Yes, they are here in our office.  Engaged in urgent and important business.  - I temporarily turned off the microphone on the phone and turned to the sysadmins.  They played in tsu-e-fa, who will start the server lying in front of them first.  - Kostya, here the chief accountant is looking for you, says the case, it‚Äôs really important! <br><br>  - I just can not tear myself away.  Ask what she has there.  Again, probably with their crooked hands, it went somewhere wrong.  Always with her problems!  - Kostya replied, wiping the sweat from his forehead with his hands smeared with thermal paste and leaving on his face stripes of a battle sisadmin coloring. <br><br>  - Olga Borisovna.  Konstantin cannot come up now, but he asks: what happened to you?  He will gladly help you! <br><br>  - You know, Alexander, somehow accidentally deleted the data on the salary of the administration department.  I do not know what to do!  Konstantin once said that they have some kind of ‚Äúcaps‚Äù and they can return everything. <br><br>  - Probably he meant backups.  Now I will check with him!  - I had to turn off the microphone again.  - Listen, Kostya, this chicken rubbed from the base all the information about the salary of our department.  He says that you should drop everything, break into a cake, but unroll an old backup and return everything! <br><br>  Kostya broke out with such epithets to the chief accountant, skillfully combining swear words with a description of general physiology that even the seemingly all-knowing Brain (Anton) wrote something to himself in a notebook. <br><br>  - It's good that we have morning backups.  Tell this ***, that if she again thrust *** in *** base, I will be long and slow ... - it seems, Kostya has a fantasy.  He scratched the strap of the back of his head and continued.  - In short, let everyone there, in accounting, come out of *** 1C-ki, and if at least one more time ... <br><br>  Our senior sysadmin disappeared into his office, muttering nervously something under his breath. <br>  - Olga Borisovna, Konstantin asked me to tell you that now he will do everything in the best possible way, only all accountants need to get out of 1C, he will recover the information.  Have a nice day. <br><br>  I hung up.  I'm done.  Today is a holiday, and on this day you should not be angry with users.  Especially when it comes to salaries. <br><br>  Another hour flew by.  During this time I managed to read a couple of chapters from the book "Learning Python" periodically glancing at the monitoring window.  Kirill, having thrown the tinkering with a server, sat down at someone's computer.  He clearly did not want to return to his office, Kostya there periodically shouting obscene words, unfolded the backup and clearly could have attracted him to this work.  I thought: I wonder if it would be possible to make a backup of life, then there probably would not be a doctor left?  Type of sick - oops, and rolled back yesterday, health, has not yet coughed. <br><br>  My thoughts again interrupted the phone call. <br><br>  - Hello, is it Alexander?  - I again recognized the voice of Olga Borisovna.  - You know, I created a report here and suddenly everything was hanging.  I rebooted the computer and now does not let me in 1C. <br><br>  - Stop, Olga Borisovna.  So I told you that everyone needs to get out of 1C, now Kostya is recovering data. <br><br>  - So it all came out.  And I can not, I have to finish the reports there! <br><br>  My own hands clenched into fists, and I heard the gnashing of my clenched teeth.  Calm, calm.  Today is a holiday, why do we need problems?  I turned off the microphone. <br><br>  - Cyril, please intercept the call.  This is from accounting.  Otherwise, I am afraid that I will start giving advice that will harm the health of our users ... <br><br>  - Eh, always like this!  Only one thing you start and here you are.  - Cyril went to his office and after a couple of minutes short beeps sounded in my phone - he transferred the call to his phone. <br><br>  I put the phone down with relief.  Yes, you are not on duty at night.  During the day, you can shove such tasks to others.  I wonder how you can stay so calm with such users?  Iron nerves. <br><br>  Only I was going to walk to the rest room to pour myself some tea, as I noticed an approaching delegation through a transparent door from the office.  A couple of minutes later Yevgeny Pavlovich entered our office with him, our CEO, as well as a guy of about twenty (well, understandably, a translator) and, in fact, the Chinese inspector himself.  He looked to be about fifty years old, even though he was dressed quite young, but his gray-haired head betrayed him as a seasoned engineer.  In his hands he held a weighty bag with painted hieroglyphs and some familiar logo. <br><br>  - And this, so to speak, is the brain of our scientific research institute.  The administration department of the data center.  Said Boris Mikhailovich, letting engineer Lee forward.  - Here our employees are on duty around the clock, monitor all services and servers, using the monitoring system developed by us. <br>  The guy chirped something to the Chinese and he happily nodded. <br><br>  - Now our youngest employee Alexander is on duty.  Yevgeny Pavlovich, you continue, and I will go.  Cause  - Said our general and almost disappeared from the office. <br><br>  Our manager was visibly worried and clearly wanted the check to be brought out of our department as soon as possible. <br><br>  - In general, about this department, Boris Mikhailovich has already told you, let's go to the office of the system administrators, and you will start checking?  - suggested Evgeny Pavlovich and with a quick step moved to the next room.  Behind him, the "tail" rushed our guests. <br><br>  Passing by me, he hissed in a fierce whisper: <br><br>  - What the fuck red triggers still hang.  Quickly call Kostya, and do something with it - it should not get in his report! <br><br>  - Kostya is busy now, he is dancing around an accounting backup!  Now I will call Potap, he seems to be free. <br><br>  I quickly rang Potapa, he didn‚Äôt particularly mind to dump from there, as the check was directed to them. <br><br>  - In short, we have been picking here since this morning.  This is all bookkeeping hit!  - Potap rubbed his hands with impatience.  - We collected servachok.  Now I‚Äôll pump the linux there, raise the monitoring system in test mode, but with all the same triggers, let them all be green.  You switch to fake page and type monitor it.  But from time to time he himself gazes at the real picture, all of a sudden there ... <br><br>  - Fig you are cunning, and if he checks? <br><br>  - Yes, you think he will understand how everything works there?  I can‚Äôt understand half of what our development has done, moreover, they no longer understand themselves!  It works and that's it.  Magic!  But this was once a server from a test stand and Stollov constantly worked on it.  Once he launched something on it, the server grunted, puffed and no longer came to life.  This morning we were looking for what the problem was.  In general, all the rules now.  Shcha system pump. <br><br>  Potap grabbed someone's monitor from the next table, pulled the mouse and the mouse, and went to set up the fake server.  He did this masterfully in twenty minutes. <br><br>  - All, come on page fig-proverka.niichosi. <br><br>  - Listen, and maybe at least remove the "FIG" from the address, and then pale yellow somehow? <br><br>  - Eh, there is no sense of adventurism in you.  Check, come on! <br><br>  I opened this page, and the ideal picture of the monitoring system, not a single red trigger, opened before me.  The statuses of all servers are highlighted in a pleasant green color. <br><br>  - Oh, really cool!  Always so.  All, let's hide this server somewhere. <br><br>  - Yes, where can you hide it?  It‚Äôs certainly not big, but we don‚Äôt have much space here. <br><br>  - And let's go to the nightstand to Palych?  He still does not remove anything there and there is enough space.  Close the key.  He does not seem to be very buzzing, and no one will check there. <br><br>  - Hmm, the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãcourse.  Will it burn there?  Well, and don't care - it will burn again - we will revive again and call it Phoenix. <br><br>  Potap went to the table of our leader, opened the nightstand and began work on the ‚Äúnykuyu‚Äù server.<font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Once he had finished, Evgeny Pavlovich entered the office from the admin office. I barely managed to switch the monitoring window to a fake page. He glanced at my monitor, and a nervous smile spread across his face. </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">- Oh, yes really done! The third generation of our system administrators and programmers could not solve the problem of the load on these servers! How did? </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">‚ÄúYou know, Yevgeny Pavlovich,‚Äù began Potap. - our generation is the most progressive. The level of intelligence of the youngest employees of the IT department, is many times greater than all generations ... </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">- In short, they have ‚Äúfiled‚Äù a temporary server with a fake monitoring system so far </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">- I interrupted Potap. He glanced at me with annoyance. </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">- Hackers! The server itself where? </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">- We hid it in the most safe place, in your desk.</font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">- Hmm, an unexpected idea. Okay, at the time of the check it will be a ride, but so that later they will undertake this business! We have a dreadful problem here. The Chinese brought with him some kind of software. Now they are putting Kostya from Kostya, she will collect information from all the computers, starting with the iron filling and ending with a list of all the software. If you consider how much programmers have left software. Yes, and you, okhlamonov, take: you have every counter, in which you spike at night. I know everything!</font></font> But now is not about that.<font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">After such statistics about the software, we just can not hold out here. There is one thing! Now you will laugh. This "engineer" to collect information brought kilogram floppy! </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">- Uhh. Are they still used? - Micah was surprised. </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">- I last saw flopik five years ago! - Brain cast a vote. </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">- Do not believe it, he brought his, portable, USB-shny. Admins there, in shock, but well done, do not serve the species. In short, as long as they fill in the floppy disks there, let's think about how to get out? </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Max, who remained silent until that moment, opened the drawer of his desk and pulled out a magnet with the logo of our NIICHOSI. He turned to us and said with a smile: </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">- And let's give him a gift as a keepsake. I have three more such.</font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Everyone was a little silent in confusion. Then Evgeny Pavlovich grunted and said: </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">- This is a diversion, damn it! But in our position this is the way out. Make sure that all three hit him in the package with floppy disks. </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">- Will be done! - Potap gladly responded, grabbed souvenirs and rushed to the aid of the admins. </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">A few minutes later Kirill flew out of their office. He was out of breath, though, and he was only ten meters away. His left eye twitched a little.</font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">- Evgeny Palych, they are already finishing uploading information to floppy disks, half of the demagnetized ones turned out to be there. But this is not all trouble! First of all, the translator cannot explain to the verifier why Kostya periodically begins to laugh. And secondly, this Lee announced that he wants to test the automation of our systems on the example of switching to a backup Internet channel! And we have not completed yet, so yesterday we were going to test. </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">- Your division! - our leader was furious. - More than half a year has passed since you have been worrying about this problem! That is, there is nothing to show? Now it's too late to test. Kostya here quickly, and you go to replace him. With diskettes you can handle it? </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Cyril ran to his. Five minutes passed, and a smiling Kostya entered.</font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">- Palych, do not psyche! Everything's Alright. SchA I run to the server. How are you going to check the transition to the backup channel, so I manually wire the wires, he will not notice anything at all. You just call me when it starts. And this ... - Kostya wrinkled his forehead a little and scratched his head. - There in the server room, in short, we moved the servers last week with the guys. Well, not for Feng Shui, they stood. We put them in a circle, they work better, they are so much more fun and see each other. I'm afraid our Hua won't like it. So I would have guys about ten minutes, we'll fix everything. </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Yevgeny Pavlovich sat at his desk, silently looked at Kostya and nervously twisted the key to the nightstand, where he was whistling a fake server with his coolers.</font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">- Well, I see you do not mind. - the system administrator was delighted. - Micah, Max went, help not mentally, but physically. Brain - you are the brain, poduzhur for Sanya a little. He will help too. </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">We four together moved to the server. </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The servers in the stands buzzed merrily and winked at us with green lights. Indeed, the racks in the middle of the server room stood in such a way that the wires connecting them formed the correct octahedron. </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">- So, Max, Miha, you will move that rack, there will be more servaks there. - began to command Kostya. - I'm here this shift. And you, Sanya, move that one over to the place, as it used to be, there is only one single-unit one - you will move it.</font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">And really it was the newest rack. It has not yet had time to fill. I took a more comfortable position and began to back up with the stand to the place where she had previously stood. It was not at all difficult. But it was necessary to do it carefully. I almost dragged her to the right place, as my right leg caught something, and I, by surprise, fell on my back. I did not have time to release the stand, and she flew at me from above. </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">- Wow, damn it! - I wanted to scream, but the rack lay a server right on my chest, so the cry did not work, but some kind of hissing broke out.</font></font><br><br>  - Oops.<font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">It seems our server has fallen! </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">- I heard the exclamation of Max from the other end of the server. </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">That's because the irony! </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The server fell ... to the sysadmin. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The thought flashed through my head: ‚ÄúProbably, this is the most honorable end of a sysadmin‚Äôs life. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">He died from a fallen server "! </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Hundreds of lines of scripted code began to rush before my eyes. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">I almost stopped hearing the noise of the servers in the server room and the cries of guys hurrying to help. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The server squeezed the chest more and more. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">There is almost no air left. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">I closed my eyes and ... </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">I opened my eyes and saw that my cat, Byte, was lying on my chest. </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">- Meow! </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">- he jumped up happily when he saw that I was awake. </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">I looked at the wall. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The clock was 6:55. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">It began the last Friday of July. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Today is the day of the System Administrator! </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Today I am on duty.</font></font></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/307710/">https://habr.com/ru/post/307710/</a></p>
