Know that your rights are not only the purchaser, but also human being trampled upon with your connivance. <br>  This post is about how to <strong>not</strong> do business and how to know and protect your rights.  At the same time, I hope this post will read the M.Video manual and change the suggestion program for the staff. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h2>  Testimonies of victims </h2><br>  Writing <a href="http://nellyne-the-cat.livejournal.com/101133.html%3Fthread%3D834061">batr00t</a> <br><blockquote>  But these are everyday trifles, I don‚Äôt pay much attention to them.  More depressing is another thing: they are not allowed to go to self-service stores with bags, backpacks and other hand luggage.  In all grocery supermarkets, the administration and security have already been taught by bitter experience, and they know that it is impossible to demand to leave ‚Äúyour handbag‚Äù in a cell with a lock.  But with other problems so far.  For example, in M-video, it is necessary for a long time to explain to the guards their rights and obligations regarding hand luggage.  Of course, I understand them, they steal them, but I will not risk my things for the sake of their peace, no matter how much they cost. </blockquote><br><br>  Writes <a href="http://impravo.ru/jaloba/525-nepravomernye-dejstviya-oxrany-v-m-video.html">Night</a> <br><blockquote>  Tell me, on what basis the security of the store M Video requires to show them a check?  After all, this is my property, and I do not owe them anything?  When I asked what kind of right they checked the check, it was answered that they had everything according to the instructions.  But the instruction is not above the law !!!  Help to understand this situation. </blockquote>

      Writes <a href="http://community.livejournal.com/stavropol/452882.html">d0xt0r</a> , two years ago: <br><blockquote>  I hasten to warn you that ‚ÄúI am for chamomile and plush.  And who is against, to that armature on e * lu. "(C) tema <br><br>  The story is this: the three of us are walking with Viks and Masha, we go to M.Video on Dzerzhinsky, see the gadgets.  I unexpectedly stumbled upon a working Wii with Guitar Hero 3. Since I had long wanted to test this toy, I took the controller, climbed the menus and handed it to Viks.  Wicks played one track, and as soon as I decided to pick up the controller-guitar, a certain woman runs up (by the way, without a badge) and ‚Äúfrom the threshold‚Äù starts telling that I urgently put the guitar, since ‚Äúwe don‚Äôt have a game club".  From such a statement, I was speechless for a couple of seconds and immediately told her that I was not used to this attitude, because I did not hear anything like it in other stores (in Eldorado, we once played Wii for half an hour and consultants and merchants only they didn‚Äôt hinder this, but were completely positive from the fact that we attract the attention of buyers to consoles).  I put the guitar, the lady retired, but since I'm rude, naturally, I don't understand, I continued to play.  There is a standing next to the girl consultant screaming "they are playing again!" And this lady appeared from nowhere.  Again, the ‚Äúdebriefing‚Äù began, she said that ‚Äúwe can try no more than 5 minutes here,‚Äù although no warning about this was signed and stamped by the head anywhere.  Here the fellow consultant Alexey decided to tell us about the plight of the sellers, who in the event of a breakdown pay for the goods.  I do not know why they decided that it was we, the three perfectly adequate, normal-looking people, who suddenly decided to break the controller-guitar about the plasma, shouting "Rock and roll is alive!".  Of course, I tried to explain in a completely polite and relaxed manner that it‚Äôs impossible to communicate with visitors and I understand the sellers ‚Äôconcern about the integrity of the goods, but he doesn‚Äôt have anything, especially since we didn‚Äôt plan to spend the whole evening at the store for Guitar hero, just try the game within 10 minutes, to which the consultant stated to me that she understands the trade much more than me and turned off the TV. <br>  Since we didn‚Äôt want to ‚Äúbutt‚Äù completely, we simply left M.Video, but the unpleasant aftertaste remained.  Moreover, I personally have never seen such rudeness in home appliances stores. <br>  In general, I did not argue with the staff.  But I do not like it when a customer is considered to be a sucker, who can dictate his conditions. <br>  Tomorrow I will do everything possible (half an hour to go to their leadership there), so that these people receive a lecture on the inadmissibility of rudeness in the workplace. <br><br>  And how would you do in this situation.  Do you consider it necessary to deal with the "soviet rudeness"?  What methods do you usually work on cad? <br><br>  UPD: That unbalanced lady turned out to be an employee of a security company, who valiantly serves in the M.Video store.  <strong>I talked to a senior manager, promised to take action.</strong>  In a week, for the sake of interest, I'll come back to play Wii again :) Let's see if the situation changes for the better. </blockquote><br><br>  Writes <a href="http://community.livejournal.com/stavropol/647782.html">jedi_to_be</a> , our days, the same store, nothing has changed: <br><blockquote>  April 10, 2010 at 8:00 pm (the shop is open until 9:00 pm) my younger brother and I visited the M.Video network store at G. Stavropol, ul.  Dzerzhinsky with the aim of choosing a birthday present for my brother.  We went to the computer games department, where we liked a computer game steering wheel worth 10 (ten) thousand rubles in a public demonstration window.  Observing all the norms of decent behavior and extremely careful attitude to this product, I decided to try it out in the game.  After about 100-150 seconds (one hundred and fifty seconds), two security officers of the M.Video store approached us and, in coarse form, offered to leave the gaming department of the store.  They motivated it by the fact that "you cannot play all day in our store."  I draw your attention that there were no other visitors in the store who wanted to test game products, and there were no signs and warnings regulating the time of the ‚Äúgame‚Äù.  As a result, my brother and I were completely spoiled by a festive mood, and the store lost potential profit in the amount of ten thousand rubles, as we decided to abandon the purchase due to rude attitude of the staff. </blockquote><br><br>  <a href="http://peppper.livejournal.com/276855.html">Peppper</a> writes <br><blockquote>  came in red.  In vain <br><br>  m-video in Stavropol is a cluster of idiots surrounded by slightly outdated products at an inflated price.  At the entrance every time I hear ‚Äúa young man!  Stand still  Leave the backpack! ‚ÄùAnd every time I leave for disassembly for later who is who in this hozmage.  At the exit, sometimes that Swiss opens her mouth to check my backpack.  I tolerate and keep quiet, do not pay attention.  I am deaf and dumb for her.  Every time I observe a handful of consultants engaged in something interesting, but not only work.  And of course, absolutely illiterate consultation if they pay attention to me.  There is no service in m-video.  Delivery and installation at the expense of the buyer.  Delivery not earlier than tomorrow.  Prices compared with Moscow for two, three, four thousand more expensive.  I wonder why?  Buy and deliver to the regions cheaper in Moscow.  I am already beginning to like to be a secret buyer, I would still pay money for it. </blockquote><br><br><h2>  Expert Tips </h2><br><br>  <a href="http://aproject.ya.ru/">Michael Alferov</a> responds: <br><br><h3>  Questions </h3><br><ol><li>  Do employees or store guards (PSCs) have the right to oblige to hand over personal belongings to the storage room? </li><li>  Do store employees have the right to put any marks on personal belongings when entering the store (for example, the store has similar goods and employees try to put a mark to distinguish the goods purchased earlier from the goods in the store) or pack personal belongings in polyethylene? </li><li>  Can a security guard inspect personal items (pockets, bags, bags, etc.) when a customer leaves the store? </li><li>  When the moment of theft comes: a) the goods are put in a pocket, bag or in the bosom b) the goods are carried through the cashier without paying c) the goods are taken out of the store? </li><li>  What legal actions can a store guard take if there is a suspicion of theft? Is it possible to inspect personal belongings? </li><li>  What legal actions can a store guard take if they have noticed the fact of theft (the guard saw that the goods were put in a pocket or bag, and were not paid when passing through the cashier and can prove the theft), can he detain the person? </li></ol><br><h3>  Answers </h3><br><ol><li>  Not.  Neither the store‚Äôs employees nor the guards have such a right.  You can donate personal items to the storage room (which are made for the convenience of visitors) upon request.  There is an opinion that the store administration is not responsible for the storage of personal belongings.  However, familiarization with Chapter 47 of the Civil Code of the Russian Federation makes it clear that the store still has such responsibility (when depositing things, you take a numbered token, which, as a rule, is attached to the key of the camera cabinet).  Reason: there is no law obliging you to leave personal belongings in the luggage storage (enter into a storage agreement) of the store. <br><blockquote>  Citizens and legal entities are free to enter into a contract.  Forcing a contract is not allowed (Article 421 of <a href="http://www.consultant.ru/online/base/%3Freq%3Ddoc%3Bbase%3DLAW%3Bn%3D84645%3Bp%3D17">the Civil Code of the Russian Federation</a> ). </blockquote><br>  In this case, the principle of "What is not prohibited, it is allowed."  The law "On approval of the rules for the sale of certain types of goods" is also on your side.  According to him, the store should not prevent acquaintance with the product, its qualities and properties, price, etc. </li><li>  Not.  This right has no store employees.  Private property is inviolable.  Security cannot hold marks on personal belongings or pack bags in polyethylene.  Reason: personal belongings are private property (‚ÄúConstitution of the Russian Federation‚Äù, Article 8.2, Administrative Code, Article 1.2, ‚ÄúLaw on the Police‚Äù, Article 1, 2, 9). </li><li>  Not.  The guards or the store administration cannot inspect the buyer's personal belongings. <br><blockquote>  34. Employees of a self-service enterprise should not require buyers to present goods purchased at other enterprises when entering the sales area, and when exiting they should not check the payment for the purchase and inspect personal belongings (Chapter 4 Letters of March 17, 1994 N 1-314 / 32-9 <a href="http://www.consultant.ru/online/base/%3Freq%3Ddoc%3Bbase%3DLAW%3Bn%3D8309">"On the approximate rules of the retailer and the basic requirements for the operation of a small retail network"</a> ). </blockquote><br>  The inspection can only be carried out by police officers (in the presence of 2 witnesses of the same sex).  Basis: <a href="http://www.consultant.ru/online/base/%3Freq%3Ddoc%3Bbase%3DLAW%3Bn%3D83392%3Bp%3D28">‚ÄúCode of Administrative Offenses‚Äù (CAO)</a> , art.  27.1 and art.  27.7, as well as the ‚Äú <a href="http://www.consultant.ru/online/base/%3Freq%3Ddoc%3Bbase%3DLAW%3Bn%3D83146%3Bp%3D1">Law on the Police‚Äù</a> , Art.  eleven. <br><blockquote>  To fulfill the duties assigned to it, the police are given the right to carry out, in accordance with the procedure established by the legislation on administrative offenses, personal searches of citizens, inspection of things in their possession, if there are sufficient data, to assume that citizens carry weapons, ammunition, explosives, explosives devices, narcotic drugs or psychotropic substances (paragraph 2 of paragraph 2 of article 11 of the ‚ÄúLaw on the Police‚Äù). </blockquote></li><li>  Theft is the secret theft of another‚Äôs property (‚ÄúCriminal Code of the Russian Federation‚Äù, art. 158).  The theft is considered complete from the moment when the guilty person acquires a real opportunity to dispose of the seized property of others at their discretion (Resolution of the Presidium of the Moscow City Court of 06.06.1996).  The moment of theft comes at the moment of leaving the store without paying for the goods (passing with the unpaid goods past the cash hub may qualify as an attempt at theft).  In Russia, there is a presumption of innocence: <br><blockquote>  Irremovable doubts about the guilt of a person brought to administrative responsibility, are interpreted in favor of that person (CAO Article 1.4). <br></blockquote><br>  Foundation: <a href="http://www.consultant.ru/online/base/%3Freq%3Ddoc%3Bbase%3DLAW%3Bn%3D84918">‚ÄúCriminal Code of the Russian Federation‚Äù</a> , Administrative Code, <a href="http://www.consultant.ru/online/base/%3Freq%3Ddoc%3Bbase%3DLAW%3Bn%3D83300">‚ÄúCriminal Procedure Code of the Russian Federation‚Äù</a> (Art. 14). </li><li>  The guard may ask to voluntarily show the contents of the bag or package.  To detain you, not having sufficient bases, or to force to show contents of a bag the security guard has no right.  Reason: See p. 3 Responses. </li><li>  Yes.  The security guard may detain a person who has committed an unlawful encroachment on the protected property, after which he must immediately transfer such person to the ATS.  A good reason could be, for example, a recording made by surveillance cameras or the sound of an anti-theft system.  The basis: the law <a href="http://www.consultant.ru/online/base/%3Freq%3Ddoc%3Bbase%3DLAW%3Bn%3D70248">‚ÄúOn private detective and security activity in the Russian Federation‚Äù</a> . </li></ol><br><br>  * answers to the questions are given solely on the basis of independent familiarization with legislative acts and do not pretend to be legally accurate <br>  ** if you think that you have enough knowledge on the topic, please add answers or amend the existing ones <br>  *** if there are cases of violation of your rights in your life, please tell about them in this topic (it is advisable to indicate the place of unlawful actions (shop, department store, etc.) and their nature) <br><br>  There are still open questions about what should be done, if, nevertheless, contrary to the law, your rights were violated by the store employees or representatives of a private security company? </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/90778/">https://habr.com/ru/post/90778/</a></p>
