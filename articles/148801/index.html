Google‚Äôs share of the US market has decreased by 5%</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/c15/22f/fbd/c1522ffbdfcaa99966fbf4544959ac84.jpg" align="right">  Can we assume that we have reached the "peak of Android"?  Today this idea was put forward by Strategy Analytics.  Last week, the company noted that Android‚Äôs partner, Samsung, had become the leader in the global sale of smartphones, following the results of the last quarter, capturing more than 50% of the market.  Today it turned out how <a href="http://www.strategyanalytics.com/default.aspx%3Fmod%3Dreportabstractviewer%26a0%3D7614">things are going</a> on in the key North American market: surprisingly, Android sales have decreased by 5% compared to the previous year - and Strategy Analytics believe that Android may be ‚Äúapproaching the peak‚Äù of its market share. <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  Analysts say that in the second quarter ended June 30, trends in the sale of American smartphones reflected a decline in the share of Android, which is also recorded worldwide.  Total sales in the United States amounted to 23.8 million units, which (as well as with Android), is 5% less than what was sold during the same period last year.  Android, with its 56% share of total sales, still dominates the US market, but Apple, according to analysts, was able to benefit from the fall of Google, and became the only company whose operating system showed an increase compared to last year. <br><br>  Apple's total sales in the United States amounted to 7.9 million units, which gave them 33% on the market, which is 10% more than last year.

Canadian company market share and sales fell by almost half;  now their sales are 1.6 million units and they occupy 6.5% of the market, while Apple continues to conquer the corporate market, and RIM loyal fans are all waiting for the BlackBerry 10 devices to be released until next year.  These are the lowest rates of RIM in recent history, as Strategy Analytics points out. <br><br>  And, as a sign of ongoing consolidation around the two main players, "other" companies (including Microsoft / Nokia's Windows Phone and other manufacturers) reduced their sales to 1 million units per quarter or 4% of the market. <br><br>  ‚ÄúThis rating showed some of the lowest growth results in an important US smartphone market,‚Äù said Alex Spector, deputy director of Strategy Analytics in his report.  The reasons for this are the same as those on the global market: economic problems, the high degree of penetration of smartphones into the market and the tightening of the renewal policy conducted by companies in order to strengthen their advantage. <br><br>  Neil Mouston, chief executive of Strategy Analytics, describes Android as an OS ‚Äúsuited to its peak,‚Äù while Apple's iOS continues to gain ground.  This is an interesting turn of events, considering that last week, Apple spent some time explaining why their market numbers were not that high.  They referred to the part of users who have postponed the purchase, as they expect the release of a new iPhone, as well as a slowdown in economic growth and some other problems.  ‚ÄúAccording to rumors, Apple is planning to launch a new iPhone in the coming weeks, and this event, if it takes place, will have an even greater impact on the Android share it occupies in the US domestic market,‚Äù he said. <br><br>  In <a href="http://www.imore.com/apple-iphone-5-and-ipad-mini-event-planned-september-12-iphone-5-release-date-september-21">one article</a> published yesterday, even the exact release date is called not only the iPhone 5, but also the mini-version of the iPad.  According to iMore, the presentation of these products will be held on September 12th. <br><br>  [ <a href="http://apps4all.ru/">Apps4All</a> by <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/07/30/androids-us-market-share-declined-by-5-in-q2-approaching-a-peak-strategy-analytics/">Techcrunch</a> ] </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/148801/">https://habr.com/ru/post/148801/</a></p>
