This is a desktop cradle for phone and car holder.  Both devices can charge the phone.  Both came to me from Hong Kong this morning.  I liked both <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  HTC Sensation I bought after using the iPhone for a while.  I used to, that for any use there are dozens of different gadgets of different companies.  Stands, cradles, holders in the car, etc.  When I started to look for the same for HTC, I was shocked by the fact that there are practically no accessories.  I was looking for a holder in the car and docking station, which could immediately charge the phone.  Inserted and forgotten.  No need to connect any additional wiring.  And somewhere on the enemy sites I came across KIDIGI products.  I looked at their site and was pleasantly surprised - all I needed was there. <br><br>  I ordered everything on their official online store and after 3 weeks the package was already knocking on my door :-).  Unfortunately, she stayed because  in the beginning of October, the Chinese had some kind of a holiday, and until the 10th no one practically worked. <br><br><h4>  HTC Sensation USB Cradle </h4><br>  <a href="http://www.kidigi.com/product_lv2.php%3Fpid%3D1301">www.kidigi.com/product_lv2.php?pid=1301</a>

      The box had a cradle, a USB-microUSB cable and charging to a European outlet.  Everything was neatly sealed in the bags, and the cradle is plastered with film.  I can not say that I am happy charging.  Anyway, the cradle is connected to the computer, and there is enough USB-charging in my home. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/6b2/056/087/6b2056087085030b0612cf05ab7c6d03.jpg" alt="Contents of delivery"><br><br>  Cradle is pleasant to the touch.  It looks "expensive", and not as a cheap Chinese fake (not cheap, by the way, never :-)). <br><br>  Behind the cradle is a microUSB connector.  In the place where the phone has a volume button, there is a notch on the cradle.  When you insert the phone the volume is not pressed.  There is a version of the cradle with a connector for charging the second battery.  But I am not a fan of having spare batteries, so I don‚Äôt see any reason to overpay for it. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/da8/96d/b4f/da896db4fcd32b67352a0a85641a77d9.jpg" alt="Backside"><br><br>  Bottom cradle rubber feet.  Without a phone, the cradle is firmly on the table and does not slide, and it is impossible to accidentally ‚Äúbrush‚Äù it off the table with the phone. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/dd2/e46/ed0/dd2e46ed0ecb773f079609888985fa93.jpg" alt="Legs"><br><br>  Overall on the table looks beautiful.  I was afraid that it would be hard to get into the connector, but my fears were in vain.  Inserts and gets the phone quite simply with one hand. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/d1c/f3a/37f/d1cf3a37f4e2fc6862662354e7d11f65.jpg" alt="Appearance"><br><br>  A few words about safety ... I have to think about her when the child is at home :-).  So, to break the connector, pulling the phone, will not work.  When you pull the phone towards yourself, it turns over with the cradle.  When you push the phone away from yourself, it rests against the cradle rim and the connector remains intact. <br><br><h4>  New HTC Sensation Car Mount Cradle </h4><br>  <a href="http://www.kidigi.com/product_lv2.php%3Fpid%3D1310">www.kidigi.com/product_lv2.php?pid=1310</a> <br><br>  The holder kit is standard: cradle, holder with suction cupboard, disk for mounting on the panel, cord, charging, micro instruction.  Everything was packed in sachets, and the glossy panels were sealed with film.  Everything came neat, new, without scuffs and scratches. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/70e/6d2/6ae/70e6d26aebb42c286b4088d99cca8ac6.jpg" alt="Contents of delivery"><br><br>  Cradle and holder look and feel nice, but the cable and charging - so-so. <br>  The holder is good, without bending parts.  Everything is fixed with clamps.  From experience I know that this will not tremble in the car. <br><br>  Cradle with microUSB plug under Sensation.  The phone is inserted into it from top to bottom and fixed on top by a latch.  On the latch and on the side of the cradle - gum, so that the phone is not scratched.  Behind the cradle is a microUSB connector for charging and wire holders.  If you hold the wire through them, it will not accidentally pull out of the connector.  Trifle, but nice. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/eab/c7f/b79/eabc7fb79b0374057d68479007951e92.jpg" alt="Backside"><br><br>  In the car, everything fell without problems. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/995/d95/917/995d95917e1f7b2f27b6f1e506d92ee4.jpg" alt="Installation in the car"><br><br>  The phone is inserted as easily as in the desktop cradle.  The latch on top snaps easily and holds securely. <br><br>  The latch holds the phone well, so that it can be used in an upright position.  I like this option more because  The main screen and the call screen in Sense does not rotate. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/e34/6f4/4d6/e346f44d6aef4ca1672ccbbea1e1a0fa.jpg" alt="Installation in the car"><br><br>  Conclusions: I liked the device.  Well made, 100% fit the phone, normal equipment.  Cons: expensive ($ 28 for the cradle and $ 37 for the holder in the car). </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/130913/">https://habr.com/ru/post/130913/</a></p>
