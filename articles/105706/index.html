  <section class="page js-page"><h1>On the issue of ‚Äútheft‚Äù and ‚Äúlicense stickers‚Äù</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Very often, "copyright holders" and other copyright advocates use to describe those who violate copyright, the word "thieves."  In accordance with this terminology, you did not copy the program, you ‚Äústole‚Äù it.  Article 1273 GK permits music and movies to copy for personal use, but our propagandists manage to stick this label to people who don‚Äôt violate the law at all. <br>  Well, okay.  But the same approach works perfectly in the opposite direction.  Here is an example. <br>  Microsoft is known to supply its products with ‚Äúlicensed stickers.‚Äù  If we are talking about OEM licenses for Windows, then the sticker is glued to the computer itself, and if you bought a full-fledged "boxed" version, then the sticker, pathetically called the "certificate of authenticity", will be pasted on the box with the disks.  And God forbid you lose this sticker.  Microsoft will immediately try to steal your copy of the program, declaring it "unlicensed."  A copy you honestly bought. <br>  The same will happen if someone removes the sticker from your computer or you transfer the OEM Windows to another computer. <br>  According to this perverted logic, the sticker is the only ‚Äúlicense confirmation‚Äù of the program.  Why ‚Äúto confirm licensing‚Äù cannot be somehow different, for example, the presence of licensed discs, or purchase documents - is not clear.  But this opens up the tempting prospects, you will agree: being guided by such logic, it is possible to withdraw in general any thing for which there is no check. <br>  It was precisely in this situation that I found myself: my thoroughly licensed ‚Äúoffice‚Äù, which is excellently placed and even activated via the Internet, this corporation considers thieves to be ‚Äúpirated‚Äù: at one time I threw away the box from it. <br>  Well, let's try to achieve the truth in Microsoft technical support ... <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  The first question sent through the <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/Rus/Feedback/GeneralQuestion.aspx">form on the site</a> : <br><br>  ‚ÄúTwo questions on software licensing from Microsoft <br>  1. I have a licensed ‚Äûboxed‚Äú Office 2003 professional edition.  Recently, I learned that according to the rules of Microsoft, in order to confirm its ‚Äúlicensing‚Äù, it was necessary to keep the box from it with a user certificate, as well as documents confirming the purchase.  Immediately after the acquisition, I threw away both the box and the documents, leaving only the disks and the user's manual in the case.  Some software licensing specialists from MS claim that after that my copy of the ‚Äúoffice‚Äù became ‚Äúunlicensed‚Äù.  Such answers are contained in the ‚ÄúLicensing‚Äù section of the Technet forum (http://social.technet.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/licenseru/threads).  I would like to ask: is this really so?  Can I give my copy to a friend, will he have any problems when checking software licensing?  (After the transfer, I intend to delete my copy). <br>  I have now installed an ‚Äúoffice‚Äù on a computer running Linux, since I do not have licensed Windows.  Is it allowed to license it? <br>  2. I have a licensed Windows 95, OEM version.  The computer to which it was attached is obsolete and discarded.  Can I install this OS in a virtual machine on a computer running Linux?  I need it for experiments. <br>  This OS is not for sale now, so I cannot buy a ‚Äúboxed‚Äù version.  Is it possible to get permission from Microsoft for such an installation, and what is required for that? ‚Äù <br><br>  From: &lt;CNTUS.FEED.EU.RU.RU.GDT.MOS.CS.T01.CUS.00.EM@css.one.microsoft.com&gt; <br>  To: pavel v protasov &lt;pvphome@gmail.com&gt; <br>  Subject: RE: SRX1140035910ID - Microsoft.com/eng/feedback

      Authentication for the boxed product is a box with <br>  certificate of authenticity inside.  Payment documents are <br>  additional evidence of confirmation.
