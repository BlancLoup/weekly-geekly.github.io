I‚Äôve been used to it for a long time that in the case everyone always calls to the mobile, but for some reason he picked up the phone anyway, getting ready to listen about the next action in the nearest dentist or about the super high-speed and cheap Internet from the newly-minted provider. <br><br>  Intuition did not let me down.  A joyful voice informed me that I was ‚Äúchosen‚Äù and they could connect cable television for me completely free of charge (until September 1st) for informational purposes.  Honestly, I thought about cable television a long time ago, and once I even left a request from Beeline, but after I had an article on Habr√© that I would have to take the leased equipment myself, the application had to be canceled.  I did not hang up and continued to listen to my aunt. <br><br>  Joyful voice, feeling that I was their client, quickly continued to talk about all the advantages of their TV.

    <a name="habracut"></a>  Which channel package do you want to choose? <br><br>  Me: And what do you have? <br>  She: we have 6 packages and you can choose any 2 <br><br>  Having listened to the hasty speech about each package with simple names like ‚ÄúFascinating‚Äù, ‚ÄúCognitive‚Äù, ‚ÄúMix‚Äù, etc., I realized that I still do not understand what channels there are in these packages, I chose two to quickly stop meaningless chatter. <br><br>  After that, the girl clarified my name and address and said that tomorrow a master would come to me at a convenient time for me and connect everything.  I asked them if it was really free of charge, if the leased equipment would be taken away by their employees themselves, to which I received an affirmative answer.  The application is framed. <br><br>  A few hours later, another girl called me to confirm my order.  She again asked for my data and stated that tomorrow at the appointed time the master would come to me and connect everything.  I have to pay 140 rubles for the connection. <br><br>  I: Stop.  What are 140 rubles in question?  I was told that it is absolutely free, and I can use the services in the trial mode. <br>  She: That's right, the cable will be free, but you still have to pay 96 rubles for the wizard‚Äôs work ... <br>  I: Why, then, your words contradict the words of your employee, that I will not pay anything? <br>  She: Most likely, our employee was not aware of this, we will definitely listen to your conversation and take action.  Do you agree to the terms? <br>  Me: So I did not understand how much I need to pay?  Then you say that it is free, then 140 rubles, then 96 ... You yourself can sort out your words and name the final conditions for connecting cable TV ??? <br>  She: 96 rubles is the payment to the master and 44 rubles for ... (I did not understand why ...) <br>  Me: Are these the final numbers? <br>  She: Yes, of course, I confirm this. <br><br>  Connect agreed on Sunday.  The master arrived on time, as agreed.  I did everything quickly - I ran the cable, connected the set-top box, set up the TV.  After that, about 10 minutes talking to someone and filled out the paper. <br><br>  Master: Done, sign. <br><br>  I: (after reading the documents and noticing strange numbers totaling 754 rubles) And what are these numbers? <br>  Master: This is the amount of the monthly payment for September and the amount of the connection. <br>  Me: Mmm ... How much money should I give you now? <br>  Master: 754 rubles. <br><br>  I begin to tell him about the calls from their office, about the amounts that I was told about.  He, with a look that he is already familiar with this song, says, ‚ÄúWell then, am I turning everything off?‚Äù <br><br>  I just oh-huh ... from this whole situation and say to disconnect, and also that I am not going to pay anything.  He calls again in the office and reports about the refusal, to which, apparently, he receives a question about the reason for the refusal.  I ask to give up to talk myself. <br><br>  I explain the whole situation about the first call, about the free connection, to which I get a malicious answer: <br>  - How is it so free?  Do you know that nothing happens for free?  The master came to you, how much cable he spent, the equipment installed. <br><br>  I just go into a rage and tell her that I called them themselves, imposed their services, and now I am still guilty that I invited your master, who now demands 754 rubles from me !!!  I say that I didn‚Äôt pull anyone by the tongue and this connection is not my invention, but the statement of your employee. <br><br>  Operator: I do not know anything, I did not say this to you, and I am not going to be responsible for the employee who told me about it.  I have nothing to do with this. <br><br>  I: Why should I suffer from lies of your colleagues?  I am your cable for 754 rubles and I could connect when it would be convenient for me, and not in your company, but in Beeline, because it is more convenient for me there (I have Beeline on the Internet). <br><br>  Operator: In Beeline, TV is more expensive. <br><br>  I: Yes, I don‚Äôt care if it‚Äôs more expensive there or not, at least from there they don‚Äôt call me and don‚Äôt give me a grandmother like you do.  And the most interesting thing is that no one is responsible for anything, neither you, nor the master, nor your now virtual employee, who has started all this. <br><br>  She reluctantly listened to all this and asked if I would connect the TV.  Once again I told her that I would pay only what I had negotiated with the second operator - 140 rubles.  She agrees and asks to hand the phone to the master.  They talk for another 5 minutes (the master for some reason smiled and even laughed), after which he got up, connected everything anew and said that I needed to pay 156 rubles. <br><br>  BL ... DB <br><br>  The TV is working, the mood on the day off is spoiled.  What awaits me further remains only to guess ... <br><br>  Hi AKADO! </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/126778/">https://habr.com/ru/post/126778/</a></p>
