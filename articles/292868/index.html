  <section class="page js-page"><h1>To lose 1 million for the sake of experiment with email-mailing or we have proved it</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  It would seem quite obvious - if you send a letter to a subscriber of an online store, try to make sure that it contains goods that interest him.  For example, those that he viewed on the site, or products that were viewed.  And here it is necessary to take into account - if the recipient made a purchase, you can offer related products, and if not, both viewed, and similar, and related, to remind you of yourself and return user interest.  Mass mailing without a user search history is a loss of a part of the profit. <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  Obviously?  Yes!  Is this happening all over the place?  Not! <br><br>  I am subscribed to mailing about 15 stores, which periodically visit, look after goods, and sometimes make purchases.  And from all these shops I receive letters - once a week, three times a week and more often.  And these are just letters.  Almost all of them do not take into account my interests in this or that product group.  I looked at the coat, but I haven‚Äôt bought it yet - they offer T-shirts, sweaters, shorts ... and not a single coat.  I watched things for an infant - I received a letter with an action for schoolchildren.  And the list goes on.  The bottom line: none of these stores bothered to send goods relevant to my interests.  What should my reaction be?  Probably unsubscribe.  Of course, I do not unsubscribe, but only because I myself work in this area and treat colleagues respectfully.

      The idea of ‚Äã‚Äãpersonalization of product offers in the mailing lists of online stores, did not leave me for a long time.  And so an experiment was conducted in order to check the idea that letters with relevant goods work better than with those selected in random order, i.e.  randomly. <br><br>  <b>Relevant Products vs Random</b> <b><br></b> <br>  I want to be honest and notice that our service, on the basis of which the experiment was conducted, deals with triggering and behavioral mailings.  Which is significantly different from mass mailings.  But the parallels and dynamics of changes in values ‚Äã‚Äãcan be traced.  (For reference: at the time of this writing, only in 2015 we sent 1 663 379 letters). <br><br>  For the experiment were taken four groups of letters, which differ in the method of selection contained in their proposals: <br><br><ul><li>  Goods in the letter - relevant, that is, corresponding to the interests of the visitor on the site </li><li>  Items in the letter chosen randomly </li><li>  Products in the letter - popular, that is, from the list of best-selling on the site </li><li>  There are no products in the letter, only a call to return and make a purchase </li></ul><br><br>  The experiment was conducted on the basis of subscribers of the three sites, letters were sent to 6,000 recipients, 1,500 letters to each group.  The letters differed only in product groups, but were otherwise identical.  Then we calculated the percentage of letter conversion, that is, how many orders were made from the number of delivered letters. <br><br>  <i>Results:</i> <i><br></i> <br>  <u>Conversion to groups of letters on the sporting goods website</u> <u><br></u> <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/megamozg/post_images/ab7/5d1/f46/ab75d1f4661407e1108d23e1511dc44d.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Group 1. Conversion 17% <br><br>  Group 2. Conversion 8% <br><br>  Group 4. Conversion 7% <br><br>  Group 3. Conversion 3% <br><br>  As you can see, the letters containing products relevant to the interests of users of the online store, gave the largest percentage of conversion, while letters that do not contain goods at all - the lowest. <br><br>  <u>Conversion to groups of letters on the clothing site</u> <u><br></u> <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/megamozg/post_images/946/ae3/c2e/946ae3c2e54d5f80dc1cb80b0f267793.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Group 1. Conversion 21% <br><br>  Group 2. Conversion 11% <br><br>  Group 3. Conversion 10% <br><br>  Group 4. Conversion 4% <br><br>  The situation repeats - letters without product offers are practically not converted at all, but the conversion from letters with goods relevant to the interests of users exceeded the percentage of conversion on the sporting goods website, reaching 21%. <br><br>  <u>Conversion to groups of letters on the website selling furniture</u> <u><br></u> <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/megamozg/post_images/5c9/fc3/008/5c9fc30083b48d1d1cab0e0b1720bc6f.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Group 1. Conversion 13% <br><br>  Group 2. Conversion 5% <br><br>  Group 3. Conversion 5% <br><br>  Group 4. Conversion 2, 5% <br><br>  Letters with relevant products also performed well on this site, while the remaining groups of letters showed an equally low conversion rate. <br><br>  If you make calculations, you can see that this experiment cost us dearly.  With the sending of letters for each group, except for the relevant goods, we lost a large percentage of conversion.  But in general, more than 1,000 orders were lost - the same million. <br><br>  <b>From all this we can conclude:</b> whatever the conversion of the mailing, it is always about twice as high if it was a mailing with relevant products.  According to numerous studies and statistics on the Internet, the average percentage of mass mailing conversion is 1% or even less.  And our experiment clearly showed that it could have been much more if the letters contained relevant goods.  Perhaps, for the sake of this efficiency, you will have to work 4 times more, but it's worth it. <br><br>  <i>We offer the simplest sample of the scheme by which you can act.</i>  <i>We make a sample of the database:</i> <i><br></i> <br>  1. The visitor spent some time on the site, but did not make a purchase. <br><br>  2. At this time, the site launches the campaign "Discount on smartphone."  We check which visitors are browsing smartphones. <br><br>  3. We do newsletter to these addresses with the notification about the action. <br><br>  4. Consider options for other proposals for the same algorithm. <br><br>  5. To those who have made a purchase - we offer related products in the mailing list. <br><br>  6. By analogy, we make subsequent selections on other stocks and news. <br><br>  7. At the remaining addresses do mass mailing, as usual. <br><br>  <i>We also offer several recommendations on how to increase the effectiveness of mass mailing with the help of relevant products:</i> <i><br></i> <br>  1. Example: if a client periodically buys stationery from you, but ignores mailings with souvenir products, this does not necessarily mean that in no case should you send letters with proposals on a group of products that are not interesting to him.  There is an alternative - you just need to start a letter with relevant information, and below offer the rest.  The bottom line is that mass mailing should be on the subject to which the subscriber once showed or regularly shows interest. <br><br>  2. Do not forget that by sending offers with relevant goods, you can further motivate the recipient to purchase.  And to do it is quite simple: offer a sidka for the viewed / related products or the next purchase, gift, bonus.  There is a possibility that such an offer will encourage the purchase of the recipient who was on the site, but did not perform the target action. <br><br>  3. Some statistics.  According to a study conducted by Marketing Sherpa, sending out re-orders gives - attention!  - 53% conversion.  This is a very high figure.  We draw conclusions: periodically remind regular customers about the need to replenish stocks of products.  This item is more relevant to shops selling products, supplies, office supplies, etc., but to some extent it can be applied in some other areas. <br><br>  4. Cross-sell recommendations or related products.  The numbers and here speak for themselves - such offers in mailings increase the rate of transactions by 20% compared to mailings without related products.  A customer bought a microwave?  Offer him a set of refractory utensils.  Got a mobile phone?  You may need a case.  Logic works - it is more convenient to buy in one store, and if you offer a discount or bonus, the likelihood of making a second purchase increases several times. <br><br>  5. New items.  Example: a visitor bought from your IPhone online store.  Perhaps later he will be interested in the appearance of a new version of this phone.  So, you already have two reasons for mailing - first, the offer of accessories for the first purchase and, after a while, the arrival in the store of the novelty.  And if you offer a small discount, it will be an additional motivation. <br><br>  We hope our experience and recommendations will help to make your newsletter more effective. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/292868/">https://habr.com/ru/post/292868/</a></p>
