      However, in reality, things are a little more complicated - and this is not at all the invention of Eychara, who likes to torture you with waiting.  The hiring process can really take a long time, but with proper information from the company, it should not be so painful. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/2ee/7fa/bb7/2ee7fabb728d49089550f70f23374152.jpeg"><br><br><h3>  How does a job open? </h3><br>  In Appodeal, the need for a new employee is first determined - the team leader (Team Lead) requests HR.  The need for a vacancy is agreed with the head of the office.  The vacancy is entered into the recruitment plan of the region, a separate application is filled in for it. <br><br>  After the initiation of a vacancy, we make up its description with general information and requirements for the candidate, and then we paint the selection process. <br><br>  <i>Work on a vacancy</i> is a standard process for finding, attracting and selecting candidates.  There is nothing supernatural at this stage, however, when submitting an application, you should not forget that besides you the HR specialist has from 5 to 15 candidates.  Their applications and resumes also need to be studied in detail, and after that one or more interviews, which take from 1 to 2 hours of working time, should be conducted.  Therefore, do not panic if you are not called back two days after the interview - HR simply has to consider all candidates and cannot make a swift choice in your favor by virtue of their official obligations. <br><br>  During the interview, the HR-manager informs the terms during which they will give you an answer - usually these are the maximum terms and they vary depending on the position.  In a decent company, these deadlines are always respected, but again, it is worth remembering that they can inform you about the decision at the very last moment - simply because of the flow of candidates and internal coordination.  You have the right to contact the HR-manager at any time and clarify at what stage of consideration your resume is located.  Do not forget that candidates may indicate critical for them the timing of the response from the company - for the employer, this approach is even more convenient. <br><br><h3>  What can affect the timing? </h3><br>  It happens that a vacancy has <i>been suspended</i> .  HR specialists are people too, and they also go on vacation and get sick.  Accordingly, the search for candidates is suspended.  Sometimes during the search, a recruiting plan is revised - the number of vacancies or the requirement for candidates, which you should also be informed about (at least we report).  The vacancy <i>is considered closed</i> when a candidate is found, accepted a job offer and went to work.  Vacancy may be canceled due to a review of the plan and the lack of need for an employee.  As a rule, a vacancy is transferred to the archive after the employee leaves for work, but HR will breathe easily only when its candidate has passed the probationary period.  Therefore, a vacancy for some time may hang on the company's website or on HR-resources, and your responses will be sorted out and added to the database.  Candidates during this period will receive a standard review report. <br><br>  As soon as the accepted candidate passes the probationary period, the HR-specialist changes the vacancy status to ‚Äúclosed‚Äù on all resources, records the data on the employee and the planned release date to work in a special table. <br><br>  The higher the level of specialist skills and the degree of his responsibility, the more time it takes to find and select candidates. <br><br>  Below is a <i>table of terms</i> on which you can navigate when sending a resume.  We at Appodeal are trying to close vacancies on the principle ‚Äúthe sooner the better‚Äù, that is, HR managers are working to the fullest and are ahead of the deadlines indicated in the table :) <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/882/a6a/719/882a6a719d9a4432a626be185ed2201e.jpeg"><br><br>  In order to worry less about deadlines and not to erase at the interview, we recommend to follow a simple <i>check list</i> . <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/56b/89b/09d/56b89b09dc0c470682766f42f34c732f.jpeg"><br><br><h3>  Pay special attention to company information. </h3><br>  Incredibly, but a fact: there are often candidates who have no idea what the company is doing.  Finding out the details and asking questions is a great way to appeal to HR and see if you are suitable for the company and, not least, whether it suits you.  The websites in the sections ‚ÄúCareer‚Äù, ‚ÄúVacancies‚Äù or ‚ÄúWork with us‚Äù often contain basic values ‚Äã‚Äãof the company, there are photos of the office and potential colleagues.  Do not be lazy to drive into the search engine the name of the company plus the "interview" or "reviews" to read what the media write about your potential place of work.  Half an hour of time spent and sincere interest in what the company does is great for you to play, but apparent indifference will not save even with a good resume. <br><br><h3>  Look for a referrer among company employees. </h3><br>  Many companies have a recommendation system.  You shouldn‚Äôt urgently add to all employees at random on Facebook, but remember - perhaps at some conference you had a sincere professional conversation with one of the developers.  Feel free to write to a friend - he will receive a bonus for this or simply thanks from colleagues, and you will provide yourself with an airbag in case of high competition. <br>  <i>Jobs Appodeal, if anything, can be found <a href="https://www.appodeal.com/home/career/">on the link</a> .</i> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/331666/">https://habr.com/ru/post/331666/</a></p>
