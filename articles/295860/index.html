Every day, companies spend impressive amounts on attraction: outdoor, media, Internet portals, landing, promotion, context.  All just for people to see the number and call. <br><br>  And it is at this stage - the incoming call from the interested client - the most significant ‚Äúdischarge‚Äù takes place.  In some cases, up to 97% of attracted customers are not converted into customers, and 90% of them are lost forever because they did not take contacts and did not call again.

      <b>How does this happen?</b> <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  In an ideal world, ideal managers possess the classic sales techniques from 5 stages: <br>  ‚Ä¢ making contact, <br>  ‚Ä¢ identification of needs <br>  ‚Ä¢ presentation, <br>  ‚Ä¢ work with objections, <br>  ‚Ä¢ completion of the transaction. <br><br>  It seems that everything is simple: ask questions, listen to the client, go from one stage to another and sell.  But in fact, managers do anything, just do not sell.  <b>I conducted my own mini-study:</b> under the guise of a potential client, I called 17 Moscow companies involved in installing plastic windows. <br><br>  The peculiarity of the work of window companies is that the sale is carried out at a meeting: the measurer leaves the site (most often for free), communicates with the client, ascertains real needs and sells a turnkey solution. <br><br>  The main goal of the manager who receives calls is to ‚Äúsell‚Äù the departure of the measurer.  If this fails, then the secondary goal is to take contacts and agree on the next step in order not to lose the hot lead.  In this case, it is important that the proposal for the measurement sounded before, and better instead of cost.  When the price is called, the departure of the measurer for its miscalculation no longer makes sense. <br><br>  To assess the quality of the work of managers, I compiled a checklist of the intended conversation: <br><br>  <b>Contact Establishment:</b> Hello, Introduce, Find Out How to <b>Contact</b> <br>  <b>Identification of needs:</b> Find out the purpose of the call, <b>Identify the needs of</b> open-ended questions (we learned what task to solve new windows) <br>  <b>Proposal (main goal):</b> They offered a meeting with the measurer, Presented the benefits of meeting with the measurer (built on the identified needs) <br>  <b>Work with objections:</b> Revealed a priority objection, processed it using argument, <br>  <b>Took contacts (secondary goal)</b> <b><br></b>  <b>Agreed on the next step</b> <b><br></b>  <b>Politely out of the conversation</b> <br><br>  <b>What is the result?</b> <br><br>  ‚Ä¢ 7 out of 17 managers started talking to me about metering.  Of these, the benefits of this action were described by two.  Only in the company ‚ÄúWindows of Growth‚Äù the manager tried to work with my objections, having heard the refusal of measurement.  However, she quickly abandoned this idea, citing the fact that ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know anything about what you need,‚Äù and focused on the advantages of the company.  The <b>main problem of the market</b> is obvious - managers forget to sell. <br>  ‚Ä¢ I got 40% of the price.  The only manager from RamOkon did it after trying to sell the meeting, and not before.  At the same time, she voiced the approximate cost of the standard version and insisted that only the measurer can calculate the exact price with all the discounts.  It can even be called an argument in favor of the main goal - metering. <br>  ‚Ä¢ Half of the specialists did not achieve even a secondary goal.  They clearly did not intend to contact the hot client.  Two, instead of recording my number, reported their. <br>  ‚Ä¢ <b>Another common problem</b> is that managers ask a lot of technical questions that the client shouldn‚Äôt know in principle.  During the experiment, I had to find out what year and type of building my house, my double or single frame, and much more.  But what's the point of bombarding with professional subtleties if I still don‚Äôt buy anything and are unlikely to buy by phone?  However, 65% of managers did this. <br>  ‚Ä¢ I was informed about promotions and discounts in 3 of 17 companies.  And only a representative of Euro Windows sold related products (for example, roller blinds). <br>  ‚Ä¢ 15% of managers did not greet me and didn‚Äôt say goodbye to me.  Once I even heard: ‚ÄúWell, call back yourself,‚Äù after which the manager hung up.  35% did not introduce themselves, only three asked how to contact me. <br><br>  How many managers would really sell me the windows?  Two.  Now remember how much each incoming customer call is costing.  Three hundred, five hundred rubles?  What to do so that your managers do not pour such expensive leads into the pipe? <br><br>  <b>The answer is scripts.</b> <br><br>  If a manager has an interactive conversation card in front of his eyes, he simply cannot ‚Äúforget to sell,‚Äù do not take contacts or go deep into the jungle of counseling.  Once you have implemented an automated scripting system, you get a sales department with a single level of service, without amateur activity, which destroys the conversion.  Because in a competent script: <br><br>  ‚Ä¢ spelled out variants of greeting and farewell phrases.  The manager will definitely say hello, introduce himself, find out the name of the client (ideally, immediately put it into CRM or the system will do it automatically), politely say goodbye and wish a good day; <br>  ‚Ä¢ marked the plan of the conversation, leading to the main goal - to record the client on the measurement; <br>  ‚Ä¢ successful techniques for identifying needs, working with objections, working arguments were introduced; <br>  ‚Ä¢ current promotions and discounts; <br>  ‚Ä¢ The outline of the conversation is outlined: the manager does not need to pull a thoughtful ‚Äúnuuuu‚Äù and insert parasitic words. <br><br>  All this functionality is presented in systems of automated sales scripts.  In addition, these are adaptive services integrated with a CRM system.  They improve the original script, adapting it for each manager, client, product.  Allows you to measure the effectiveness of the script as a whole, its stages, the staff working on it.  Offers a wide range of analytical tools, statistics, opens up unlimited opportunities for efficiency growth. <br><br>  Create scripts yourself, buy ready-made and finish them for your realities, use automated systems. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/295860/">https://habr.com/ru/post/295860/</a></p>
