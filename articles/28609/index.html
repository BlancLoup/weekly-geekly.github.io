  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Review of the Cameron Maxmedia NB-1060 subnotebook with 10.2 ‚Ä≥ screen.</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"><img src="http://www.eldorado.ru/photos/71/71022081_1.jpg"><br><br>  <b>CPU:</b> <br>  The heart of this subnotebook is an AMD Geode LX800 processor.  The AMD Geode LX800 processor in its performance corresponds to the VIA 800 MHz, while its power consumption is only 0.9W (3.6 W TDP).  Such features of the processor not only allow it to work successfully without cooling fans, but also increase the level of reliability of the entire system. <a name="habracut"></a>  Based on this, the CAMERON Maxmedia NB-1060 Laptop is completely silent (the only source of noise is a hard disk) and relatively cold (the temperature of the case did not rise above 28 ¬∞ C during testing). <br><br>  In terms of performance, this processor of stars from the sky is not enough, and this is not required, because its main purpose is to work on the Internet and with electronic documents away from home or office, sitting at the station waiting for an airplane or a train.

      <b>RAM:</b> <br>  The laptop is equipped with 512 MB of RAM, of which up to 24 megabytes uses the VGA adapter integrated northbridge of the chipset.  This field of memory is enough for comfortable work in the Internet and office documents.  It's a shame that adding RAM itself will not work.  On the case of the laptop below there are no technological hatches, to access the RAM.  The only thing that can be easily removed is the keyboard. <br><br>  <b>HDD:</b> <br>  The hard disk installed in the laptop has a capacity of 60GB and a rotation speed of 4200 rpm.  A relatively low rotation speed in this case is most likely a plus than a minus, because in this case the hard drive heats up and consumes much less energy than more high-speed counterparts, and there are more than enough speed indicators for basic routine work. <br><br>  <b>Screen:</b> <br>  We should also mention the screen size.  Many people scolded Asus eeePC 701 for its small and stupid looking 7 inch screen with a completely ridiculous resolution by today's standards.  The CAMERON Maxmedia NB-1060 notebook compares favorably with the eeePC 701, the new eeePC, HP-2133, because the screen of this notebook is 10.2 inches with a resolution of 1024x600 pixels, which will allow you to work more comfortably on the Internet without horizontal scrolling, as in eeePC 701. <br>  It is also worth noting the haze of the screen.  In contrast to the "new-fashioned" glossy screens, the screen of this laptop is matte, which predisposes to work, and not to looking at yourself beloved in the mirror of the screen. <br><br>  <b>Sound:</b> <br>  The audio path is represented by an AC-97 compatible codec.  Subjectively, when listening through headphones, there are noises in the sound path in the pauses between songs, but the sound itself is beyond praise - lively, dynamic, with a good representation of the sound range.  Lovers of listening to music in headphones loud, will appreciate the audio section of this laptop - it is not just loud, it is very loud and at the same time does not distort at high volume. <br><br>  <b>Wi-Fi:</b> <br>  Pleasantly pleased with the Wi-Fi module.  The laptop managed to find in the place of testing 7 networks, and the nearby Acer 5520G is only 3. This is a very good result and it will appeal to fans of surfing the Internet via Wi-Fi.  Such indicators are primarily due to the competent design of the Wi-Fi antenna of the controller and of course using the very successful Zyxel G-202 controller. <br><br>  <b>Work with OS:</b> <br>  The laptop comes with the Linux operating system, which is only most favorably displayed on its retail price, but nothing prevents you from installing Windows XP on it, the benefit comes with a laptop with all the necessary drivers supplied.  As a result, Windows XP was installed on the laptop, although due to the lack of a built-in DVD drive, I had to use a remote one.  Windows was installed easily and no complaints in the work were found. <br>  The laptop easily copes with the playback of both video and audio files.  As test files were used compressed codecs xVid, DivX, MP3 and FLAC.  During video playback, there were no drop-down frames and braking - the image is smooth, without jerks. <br>  Of course, this laptop is not designed for games, but still managed to launch StarCraft and Dungeon Keeper 2, and the first one could be played safely.  The work of the installed Microsoft Office 2003 also did not cause serious remarks - it was quite comfortable to work. <br><br>  <b>Conclusion:</b> <br>  This laptop stands out from its peers primarily large screen (10 inches vs. 7 - 9 inches for most competitors), with a relatively identical size and weight, sufficiently capacious disk, sufficient for comfortable work and storage of a small music library.  This laptop can be recommended first of all to those who often have to travel on business trips, as well as students as a convenient learning aid. <br><br>  <b>Pros:</b> <br>  ‚Ä¢ 10.2 inch screen <br>  ‚Ä¢ Resolution of 1024x600 pixels facilitates easy viewing of web pages, without the need for horizontal scrolling <br>  ‚Ä¢ The absence of glare on the screen allows you to comfortably work and watch movies <br>  ‚Ä¢ Quite capacious hard drive <br>  ‚Ä¢ Very loud and high-quality audio headphone output. <br>  ‚Ä¢ Excellent Wi-Fi module performance <br>  ‚Ä¢ Silent cooling system <br>  ‚Ä¢ Very slight body heat during operation. <br>  ‚Ä¢ Democratic price - 10999 rubles. <br><br>  <b>Minuses:</b> <br>  ‚Ä¢ Relatively slow processor (admittedly, it copes with its responsibilities perfectly) <br>  ‚Ä¢ In the pauses between songs there may be some noise at high volume. <br>  ‚Ä¢ Difficulties with additional upgrades, such as self-adding RAM. <br><br>  Full specifications: <a href="http://www.eldorado.ru/cat/detail/71022081/">www.eldorado.ru/cat/detail/71022081</a> <br><br>  <strong>UPDATE:</strong> As requested in the comments, battery life: <br>  ‚Ä¢ View video (XVID) - 67 minutes <br>  ‚Ä¢ Audio listening (FLAC) - 1.5 hours <br>  ‚Ä¢ Standby time - 2 hours 10 minutes </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/28609/">https://habr.com/ru/post/28609/</a></p>
