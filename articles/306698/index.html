For such signatures, a method is used when certain biometric indicators or their combination are used as a supporting document.  These can be fingerprints, hand geometry (finger length and palm size), patterns of the iris, or patterns of the retina.  All of them are assembled using electronic sensors of a certain type. <br><br>  Since these physical characteristics are unique for each person, any of them, theoretically, can be used as an electronic signature.  Using biometric indicators of this type as passwords is useless, since they cannot be changed if they are compromised.  However, this data may be suitable as a type of electronic signature. <br><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Compromised Biometrics</b> <div class="spoiler_text"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/comment_images/a43/8bb/243/a438bb2430868f5b67d6f9c0489790ec.jpg"><br></div></div><br>  The only negative is that they have already learned how to forge them, and today there are very few guarantees that the person who allegedly signed the document is the one who owns the biometric signature. <br><br>  Unfortunately, it is easy to replace any of these indicators during the formation of a repeated electronic signal and present it to the computer system responsible for attaching the electronic signature to the document as confirmation.  Data interception technologies are often sufficient for this. <br><br>  So, if we talk specifically about fingerprints, the Japanese professor with a group of graduate students was able to fake all the fingerprint readers that can be found on the market, using conventional food chemistry, using a little ingenuity and candy gel from which to make marmalade cubs.  And they didn‚Äôt need any actual fingers to successfully trick all these devices.  In addition, several German journalists at CeBit Conference were able to fool several models of iris scanners using improvised masks. <br><br><h2>  Electronic digital signature </h2><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/224/993/c0d/224993c0d9fc7161e1a701638b37e9e9.png"></div><br>  In 1976, Whitfield Diffie and Martin Hellman first proposed the concept of "electronic digital signature", although they only suggested that EDS schemes could exist ("New Directions in Cryptography") <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/913/b30/1db/913b301dbe583d9cdd99bb2e79ddc46a.png"></div><br>  In 1977, Ronald Rivest, Adi Shamir and Leonard Adleman developed the RSA cryptographic algorithm, which can be used to create primitive digital signatures without additional modifications ( <a href="http://people.csail.mit.edu/rivest/Rsapaper.pdf">A method for digital signatures and public-key cryptosystems</a> ) <br><br>  After RSA, other EDS were developed, such as Rabin's digital signature algorithms ( <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/GHR">GHR</a> , <a href="http://www.springerlink.com/content/bryhef8g51vwbl10/fulltext.pdf">Secure Hash-and-Sign Signs Without the Random Oracle</a> ), <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%259C%25D0%25B5%25D1%2580%25D0%25BA%25D0%25BB,_%25D0%25A0%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BB%25D1%258C%25D1%2584">Merkle</a> . <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/5ea/a80/380/5eaa803805ffbc88fa8970e404c8f20e.png"></div><br>  In 1984, Shafi Goldwasser, Silvio Mikali and Ronald Rivest were the first to strictly define the security requirements for digital signature algorithms.  They described the models of attacks on digital signature algorithms, and also proposed a GMR (provable-resistant) scheme that meets the described requirements ( <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%259A%25D1%2580%25D0%25B8%25D0%25BF%25D1%2582%25D0%25BE%25D1%2581%25D0%25B8%25D1%2581%25D1%2582%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BC%25D0%25B0_%25D0%2593%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BB%25D1%258C%25D0%25B4%25D0%25B2%25D0%25B0%25D1%2581%25D1%2581%25D0%25B5%25D1%2580_%25E2%2580%2594_%25D0%259C%25D0%25B8%25D0%25BA%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BB%25D0%25B8">Goldwasser-Mikali cryptosystem</a> ). <br><br><h2>  Russia </h2><br>  In 1994, the Head Office of Communication Security of FAPSI developed the first Russian EDS standard - <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%2593%25D0%259E%25D0%25A1%25D0%25A2_%25D0%25A0_34.10-94">GOST R 34.10-94 ‚ÄúInformation Technology.</a>  <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%2593%25D0%259E%25D0%25A1%25D0%25A2_%25D0%25A0_34.10-94">Cryptographic protection of information.</a>  <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%2593%25D0%259E%25D0%25A1%25D0%25A2_%25D0%25A0_34.10-94">Procedures for the development and verification of electronic digital signature on the basis of an asymmetric cryptographic algorithm "</a> . <br><br>  In 2002, the <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%2593%25D0%259E%25D0%25A1%25D0%25A2_%25D0%25A0_34.10-2001">GOST R 34.10-2001</a> standard of the same name, based on calculations in the group of points of an elliptic curve, was introduced instead of GOST R 34.10-94 to ensure greater crypt endurance of the algorithm.
