      It all started after I had another layout with a non-standard font.  Moreover, I realized that this font had already been connected by me earlier in other projects.  Again I had to go look for it in folders.  And since I am an ardent optimizer of my workflow, this once again seriously concerned me.  Why not put all the fonts in one place and, if necessary, insert them into the project?  - it was thought to me, and right there decided to embody the conceived. <br><br>  Literally in 3 hours all of my fonts were collected, arranged in folders, customized paths and a snippet for the editor was written.  After the first tests, it became clear how this simplifies the process and saves time.  Any font can be connected literally in a couple of clicks. <br><br>  After two days of mild euphoria, I decided to try to bring it online, and simplify the life of my friends and colleagues.  Next were all the same actions: sorting-path-stuffing imports.  But here it was necessary to think about how to give links to import files, because not everyone uses the same editor as me.  So you need to do some kind of interface in which to display the necessary links.  As the interface was created, new ideas for implementation and optimization came.  What happened in the end, you can see <a href="http://webfont.ru/">here</a> . <br><br>  Now on the site 19 fonts in forty-eight styles, which in the same couple of clicks can be connected to your project. <br><br><h4>  How things work </h4><br>  The technology of work is extremely simple: the usual is used. <pre><code class="css hljs">@<span class="hljs-keyword"><span class="hljs-keyword">import</span></span></code> </pre>  that connects your font files to your CSS.  Links to imports are in the demo examples of font styles.  There are also links to download whales already ready.  Download the whale immediately, or work with the import and upon completion of the project, attach the font - it's your business. <br><br><h4>  Now about the buns </h4><br>  For imports, I wrote a couple of snippets: native for Sublime Text 2 and non-native for NotePad ++.  Here I will not tell you how to use them, but on the website everything is described in some detail.  Even with one screenshot.  In addition, I prepared the source for anyone who wants to write a snippet for my editor. <br>  I highly recommend using snippet.  It is fast and convenient. <br><br><h4>  Notes </h4><br>  Firefox and Opera did not want to import fonts.  More precisely, the file connection did not work if it was located on another domain.  The question was solved by driving the font file to base64.  At the same time, the archive for downloading the font contains a regular .ttf file.  What do you use in the final version - choose yourself. <br><br>  My story came to an end and there were only questions left for you. <br><br><ol><li>  How useful can it be / is it interesting to you and whether to continue increasing the number of fonts online? </li><li>  Make the site an independent service and transfer to your own domain? </li><li>  How with the probability of 101% to learn about the paid / free font without resorting to disassembling it into components or relations with the author? </li></ol><br><br>  Another special thanks to my friends, and part-time our colleagues who gave me the first feedback.  After their reviews, the site has changed.  And in some places significantly. <br><br>  For the ‚Äúdesign‚Äù, I strongly ask you not to shower tomatoes, because  I'm just a coder and did everything on a whim. <br><br>  Mandatory link to the <a href="http://webfont.ru/">site</a> in the footer post. <br><br>  ps The post was almost entirely written in the shade of lilac bushes, on a bench in Pervomaisky Square, Novosibirsk.  It's great here :) <br><br>  Thanks for attention. <br><br>  <b>upd</b> Colleagues, I look through all your comments.  Make any changes instantly fail.  And I will begin to work on the global correction of shortcomings, when there will be a less clear picture of how interesting this site is, because I don‚Äôt want to waste time, please understand. <br>  Thanks for your feedback. <br><br>  <b>upd from 08/28/2012</b> <b><br></b>  <b>The site has moved to live on its own domain and is available at the link <a href="http://webfont.ru/">WebFont.ru</a> .</b>  <b>All new fonts will now appear there, and the old version will soon begin to redirect to a new address.</b>  <b>I advise everyone to change the fonts, but the fonts will remain available for some time.</b> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/147616/">https://habr.com/ru/post/147616/</a></p>
