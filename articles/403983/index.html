  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Brawex LED Bulbs</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  In large supermarkets, LED lamps of many brands are sold, but there are brands whose lamps cannot be found in large chain stores - they are sold in construction markets, small shops and on the Internet.  One of these brands is <a href="http://brawex.com/">Brawex</a> .  In the <a href="http://lamptest.ru/">lamptest.ru</a> project <a href="http://lamptest.ru/">,</a> I have already tested 70 lamps of this brand. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/7b7/7af/80d/7b77af80dad3f9ee97f2eda8070ab0fa.jpg"></div><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Brawex has two series of lamps - Premium and Sense.  Premium Series lamps use Epistar LEDs, which have a higher color rendering index and energy efficiency.  A lamp of this series has a longer service life and a longer warranty period: 3 years for all lamps, except for filaments and two years for filaments.  Sense series lamps have warranty for different lamp models for 1 or 2 years. <br><br>  In appearance of the package, the difference between the series is not immediately visible, even though the name of the series is indicated on the package.  However, there were still the first lots of lamps on sale without specifying this name - they all belong to the Premium series.  An additional feature of the series is the strip below.  Premium is black, Sense is gray.

Most lamps work correctly with switches that have an indicator (they do not flash or dim when the switch is off). <br><br>  1. Brawex Premium lamps with E27 socket. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/6a6/f85/a2a/6a6f85a2a3dbdb1dab5c29b8f36b542c.png"></div><br>  I received 12 and 14 W pear lamps from different batches for testing - ‚Äúcold‚Äù with a color temperature of 4000K from the old batch (there is no Premium inscription on the box and the equivalent of an incandescent lamp of 85 and 100 W), ‚Äúwarm‚Äù 3000K from the new batch (Premium and equivalent 100 and 120 W are written on the box). <br><br>  All lamps, except for one, give a little less light than the manufacturer promises, but at the equivalent most of the lamps correspond to the declared. <br><br>  2. Brawex Premium lamps with E14 socket. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/20e/5ab/d13/20e5abd130cfdb2d242bcb58286e9f99.png"></div><br>  As in the test of the E27 lamps, the finger lamps give exactly as much light as the manufacturer promised.  For those who do not yet know about this format of lamps, I will show what they look like. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/ee9/69b/fb6/ee969bfb6c876fbffe485f6de16f22fe.jpg"></div><br>  Due to the shape of the ceiling, the angle of lighting of these lamps is wider.  These lamps can be used instead of the usual ‚Äúcandles‚Äù and they give more light than 60 watt incandescent bulbs. <br><br>  "Mirror" lamps R50 and R39 also give just as much light as promised, but with the equivalent, the manufacturer was wrong and not in its own favor.  The fact is that reflecting incandescent lamps give much less light than ordinary bulbs of the same power.  According to the results of my testing at a voltage of 220 V, a 40-watt incandescent mirror lamp gives only about 220 lm, while an ordinary pear-lamp of the same power gives about 310 lm.  Thus tested lamps, giving 580/330 lm.  they shine, as similar incandescent bulbs, with a capacity of 90 and 55 W, rather than 50 and 30 W, as indicated by the manufacturer. <br><br>  There are dimmable ‚Äúcandles‚Äù in the Brawex assortment, giving about 500 lm, which corresponds to incandescent bulbs, with a capacity of 55 watts.  These lamps are quite expensive - 430 rubles apiece, but at other manufacturers dimmed candles are not cheap. <br><br>  As in the first test, the rest of the lamps give a little less light than stated, but by equivalent correspond to what the manufacturer promised. <br><br>  3. Brawex Premium spotlights. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/467/9d1/fd8/4679d1fd83b914566ecb0d16ac510f9b.png"></div><br>  All tested lamps with GU5.3 base are designed for mains voltage (in Europe, this base is used only for 12-volt lamps).  The lamps for all lamps are opaque, the illumination angle is about 100 degrees (for halogen lamps, the illumination angle is usually 35 degrees). <br><br>  4. Lamps Brawex Sense. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/0ea/68d/fce/0ea68dfce6f33dc3fbfe9615d505c7bd.png"></div><br>  The most powerful lamp-pears 16 W have even a slightly larger luminous flux than stated.  Most lamps measured luminous flux was slightly lower than stated. <br><br>  The measured color rendition index of the Sense series lamps was 72.3-74.4, and on the packaging of these lamps it is indicated that it is not less than 80. <br><br>  It is believed that for residential premises the color rendering index of the light source should be at least 80, so I recommend using Brawex Sense lamps in technical and utility rooms. <br><br>  In addition to the tested lamps, Brawex has G9 cap lamps, large balls of 95 and 120 mm, T8 tube lamps, lamps, and spotlights. <br><br>  In general, Brawex lamps are good: they do not have light pulsation, Brawex Premium lamps have a color rendering index of 81-84, which allows them to be recommended for use in residential premises, almost all lamps work correctly with switches that have an indicator, the manufacturer gives three-year lamps for Premium lamps a guarantee.  If you choose the equivalent of the incandescent lamp indicated on the package when choosing lamps, the choice will be correct for most lamps.  The luminous flux of most lamps is overestimated on average by 10%.  When choosing lamps for luminous flux, this must be taken into account. <br><br>  Despite some discrepancy between the measured parameters stated, I recommend Brawex Premium lamps for purchase. <br><br>  ¬© 2017, Alexey Nadyozhin </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/403983/">https://habr.com/ru/post/403983/</a></p>
