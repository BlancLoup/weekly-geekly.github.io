April 19, 2010 published <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/91377/">an article on Habr√©</a> , announcing the launch of the project.  You can evaluate the results, as well as failures that have befallen the project during this time. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h2>  Statistics </h2><br>  For two years, the site was visited by 34,200 unique visitors.  Of these, 450 people have registered.  75% - Muscovites, 6% - St. Petersburg. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/0cb/01d/f31/0cb01df31c5a1731f4d8b05c0c674892.png" alt="Site statistics statistics"><br>  The first peak was when publishing an article on Habr√©, the second - in September 2011, when the site was added to the catalog <a href="http://best-links.net.ru/">best-links.net.ru</a> . <br><br>  A total of 126 quotes were added.  Of these, only 23 participants in the project (the rest added himself). <br>  To date, 65 citations have been checked, of which 34 are true (or the forecast has come true), 23 are false and 8 are removed from the check.

      There were 6 people in the rating of the truths, 9 liars. <br><br>  The absolute leader in the first ranking was Putin, who has 20 ‚Äútruthful‚Äù quotes and 6 ‚Äúfalse‚Äù ones.  Behind him comes the economist Mikhail Khazin (5 quotes - the truth and 1 - a lie).  Surprisingly, Medvedev, despite the fact that he constantly holds many different meetings and often speaks, gives very little exact, time-bound promises.  There are only 5 of his quotes in the database, 3 of which are verified and everything is true. <br><br>  The leader among the deceits was Boris Murashov, who was upset by the unsubstantiated promises to improve the lives of Petersburgers in every way.  Behind him, financial analyst Stepan Demura, who gave 4 forecasts, all of which did not come true. <br><br>  <i>The quotes of the astrologer Pavel Globa have been recently added, it will be curious to know his true abilities.</i> <br><br><h2>  Bad luck </h2><br>  First, the site was extremely low activity of visitors.  There are various reasons for this: an insufficiently convenient and clear interface;  the inability to get online when a person hears a promise;  desire to look more and learn about verified quotes. <br><br>  Secondly, appeals were written to all opposition parties (system and not so).  It was proposed to start active cooperation so that all current criticism was as objective and not unfounded as possible.  No party gave a positive response.  In some cases (eg: the Communist Party of the Russian Federation) it was answered that the necessary funds already exist in the form of a party site.  For the rest, as a rule, there was no answer at all. <br><br><h2>  Future </h2><br>  Truemeter is not a site for opponents or supporters of one or another power structure.  This is a site for those who want to see what is happening in the country as objectively as possible. <br><br>  Now the site is updated and filled with materials by the development team.  I really hope this post will attract people with active citizenship who will not wait for a predetermined verdict to be added to the added quote, but will observe the fate of each quote with curiosity. <br><br>  All the minimally necessary tools are ready and working: the addition of persons, materials and quotations, as well as the opportunity to personally verify the implementation of any promise and render their verdict in the section <a href="http://www.pravdometr.ru/person/not_checked/">‚Äúexperts are needed‚Äù</a> . <br><br>  Site author: <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/users/scroll/" class="user_link">scroll</a> .  In the comments he will answer all your questions, comments and suggestions. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/142565/">https://habr.com/ru/post/142565/</a></p>
