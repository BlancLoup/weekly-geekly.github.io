Flex ONE: the first review of the world's first e-book with a flexible screen</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  The other day at Habr√© published the post, <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/141047/">LG is launching the production of flexible displays</a> .  I will tell you about the first book in the world with such a display. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/85b/2d5/656/85b2d5656d1a4c93ae7e4cdb8d0c8ce6.jpg" alt="WEXLER. Flex ONE"><br><br>  What is especially nice is that this book was released by a Russian company. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  In my possession was a test copy, production is already underway.  The official press release will appear next week.  I will share my impressions about this device.

      Many reviews begin with the unpacking process.  Honestly, I do not understand the pleasure of contemplating the details of each stage, I think that the photos of the device in the case will be enough. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/89b/51c/10a/89b51c10a1c7a92e955e8cdead38a697.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  WEXLER.  Flex ONE unusual form factor: a thin screen with a significant thickening on the one hand. <br>  In this thickening all electronic stuffing is hidden: processor, battery, buttons, connectors, etc. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/617/b53/8d2/617b538d27c01fcfce8092cdabf1f216.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  The photos show that I got a copy of a glamorous pink color.  But they promised that the first batch, which will go on sale with a black backdrop.  In general, the issue with the colors of buildings is not easy.  On the one hand, consumers are no longer satisfied with Ford‚Äôs argument that a car can be of any color, if this color is black, you want individuality.  On the other hand, the choice of color is a headache for marketers and buyers.  What gamma to choose, how many need to order products in black, white, pale-green and gray-bluish body, so that they do not hang in the warehouse?  Usually I am indifferent to multi-colored devices, but here I bought the last ‚Äúsoap box‚Äù, guided by color, the charter to choose from dozens of devices of similar functionality and price.  But back to the book. <br><br>  The screen of the book really bends.  I did not try to bend strongly; my parents taught me to handle equipment and other people's things with care. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/873/d4a/bae/873d4abae8da1db5ebeaa7c2a4a0dac9.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Of course, there is a temptation to bend the device harder.  As far as I know, in the process of developing several copies died the death of the brave, and the motherboard did not stand, and not the screen. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/149/590/24f/14959024f867419e06312acd9318bfcf.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  As I already wrote, screens for WEXLER.  Flex ONE is manufactured by LG.  With the exception of flexibility, these are already familiar screens made using e-ink technology.  The contrast is very good, I will not say how many percent of whiteness, just attach a picture with the magazine MAXIM. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/bf9/640/c4e/bf9640c4edc18d2a312b8054527403cc.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Functionality is quite standard for modern e-books.  Supported formats are txt, htm, pdf, epub, doc, djvu, fb2, fb2.zip, for sure the list is not limited to this. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/363/da6/182/363da61822c44cc3b814c0351261468d.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  It is convenient to hold the book in your hands, just due to the thickening.  Screen orientation can be changed. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/32e/786/a4a/32e786a4ad8bf1714e6d8ed173ec67ca.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  The design of the buttons is somewhat unusual, they form a whole with the body, speaking above it.  At first I thought it would be inconvenient, but, most likely, this is a matter of habit. <br><br>  From the connectors on the e-book only microUSB, it serves for charging and for communication with a PC.  Personally, I welcome this decision, tired of confused in the exercises and, especially, to carry them with me. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/5bd/39f/e82/5bd39fe82ae1b8ded66485ec585c69da.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  About the settings, the choice of fonts, the inversion mode and the time setting I will not tell, everything is pretty standard. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/724/b3f/4ec/724b3f4ec461558f165a9fe4d0e815ad.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Specifications will be announced in the official press release.  I will say that the e-book was very interesting. <br><br>  If you have questions, ask, I will try to answer.  I hope the Wexler staff will connect. <br><br>  Thanks for attention.  I hope that I managed to tell about the main features of the new e-book.  There are no analogues in the world yet. <br><br>  PS Soon the director of the Wexler company will appear on Habr√©, he will be able to personally answer questions, and also will tell you more about the e-book, development and production. <br><br>  PPS Thanks to this post, Wexler appeared on Habr√©.  Therefore, all questions can be asked directly to representatives of the company. <br><br>  PPPS Because  I did not set out to establish and describe the benefits, but simply told about my impressions, then I will quote the words Wexler from the comments as an answer to the most important question ‚ÄúWhat does the flexible screen give to the reader?‚Äù: <br>  1) Weight reduction.  The book was the easiest on the world market, <br>  2) Reducing the thickness.  The book was the finest on the world market, <br>  3) Shock resistance.  The book is not afraid of falls, impacts and other minor mechanical effects. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/141108/">https://habr.com/ru/post/141108/</a></p>
