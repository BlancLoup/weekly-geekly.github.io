The idea is to create an IT HUB.  IT - because now there is a century of technology, even agriculture uses information technology.  HUB is a place that concentrates in itself various interactions, acquaintances, connections, ideas and their realization. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  The very idea of ‚Äã‚Äãan IT Hub implies large investments, but at the start there were not any, so I divided the big project into several small ones and implement them together with the guys that make up <i>our space</i> . <br><br>  <b>Step 1. <i>Anticafe</i></b> 
      <br>
        <script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>
        <ins class="adsbygoogle"
          style="display:block; text-align:center;"
          data-ad-layout="in-article"
          data-ad-format="fluid"
          data-ad-client="ca-pub-6974184241884155"
          data-ad-slot="8945601208"></ins>
        <script>
          (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
        </script>
      <br>
      In my opinion the easiest thing was to realize one of the components (entertainment) - this is Anticafe, the place where young people gather, meet, find something new. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/x_/2b/fm/x_2bfm4lxcwx_3wi6f5d_3ftf5w.jpeg" alt="image"><br><br>  The idea of ‚Äã‚Äãantikafe was taken for the base - this is a public institution where the charge is taken for time, and everything else is free.  And a little modernized.  Added the opportunity to practice yoga, go to courses, master classes, you can sing in karaoke or just watch a movie on the big screen.  In addition to the standard consoles with large screens, we added virtual reality.  School of chess and bukshering.  The music room - which should grow into a recording studio. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/to/z-/nz/toz-nzefpztckhvtzrrkgeceyza.jpeg" alt="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/2b/hr/sj/2bhrsjjetoqoa8tcjic7nxelhmi.jpeg" alt="image"><br><br>  <b>Step 2. <i>CoWorking</i></b> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/d4/mr/qe/d4mrqe9uhtxzs993ev9ewaahmzy.jpeg" alt="image"><br><br>  The second step was the creation of CoWorking (work), a zone where anyone, freelancer or company can come and work in a friendly atmosphere, to which is attached all the necessary infrastructure. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/af/tb/w2/aftbw2xabuwfgo116spshfqvwse.jpeg" alt="image"><br><br>  We provide not only a place for young and ambitious children, but also give the opportunity to use powerful computers, software that is necessary for them to work.  We teach and prompt when necessary. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/3b/nv/gc/3bnvgcodbg6-xu07apgbzveyd2k.jpeg" alt="image"><br><br>  In co-working, both freelancers and individual employees from large companies can work.  Now I am working on implementing another part of the IT HUB project.  This is the involvement of specialists from Russia. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/15/er/rj/15errj-xpxlmj9hxdn_qnhqseni.jpeg" alt="image"><br><br>  <b>Step 2.1 <i>Chasing the Startup</i></b> <br><br>  The first direction is to attract Russian startups who want to move to Europe.  In our space there are already several such stratraps, but about them in the following articles.  Lithuania is one of the first in the Baltic States to launch a startup visa. <br><br>  <b>Step 2.2 <i>Be free</i></b> <br><br>  The second direction is the motivation of employees of medium and large companies.  You can send employees to us for a couple of months or more as a bonus for good work.  For us, this is an exchange of experience.  For guys, it's a rest and a change of scenery.  For the full implementation of the part to attract specialists, we have not yet implemented the project guest house.  To ensure that the guys do not have problems with housing at first.  Or those who would like to stay and live in it.  While looking for investors. <br><br>  <b>Step 3. <i>FabLab</i></b> <br><br>  And the third part that is starting to be implemented at this time is Fablab (development).  Workshop in which you can come and use the tools to implement your project. <br>  In the fab lab, you can use 3D printers, soldering stations, a milling machine, laser cutting, tools, radio components for assembling prototypes.  On the basis of the fab lab you can hold master classes and workshops, lectures for young designers. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/8k/6-/88/8k6-88e-qnm76g3h4aeh27grjgw.jpeg" alt="image"><br><br>  <b>Almost done.</b> <br><br>  Why Klaipeda: <br><br>  In my opinion this is a strategically correct decision, from the moment we arrived, Klaipeda became the cultural capital of Lithuania, a candidate for the cultural capital of the European Union.  Klaipeda is one of the largest ports in the Baltic, there are NO metros and traffic jams, so you can spend your free time on yourself.  Here is the beautiful sea and the Curonian Spit.  There is a very large Russian-speaking community, and that is why I still have not learned the Lithuanian language. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/an/rz/0q/anrz0qv1e4by0fatgmjpdxmv1va.jpeg" alt="image"><br><br>  And the most important thing is why I and we do all this.  Our community has a mission, we know for sure that each of us has a unique ability and we set ourselves the goal of finding and developing it.  So that a person could always professionally do his favorite thing and get pleasure from it. <br><br>  <b>Questions, comments.</b> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/343246/">https://habr.com/ru/post/343246/</a></p>
