  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Announcement DotNext 2017 Moscow: a double portion of .NET</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/57c/b78/f40/57cb78f40f5542a5b4f7de1c6ddc42d0.jpg"><br><br>  A large-scale .NET conference comes to Moscow again: the nearest <b><a href="https://dotnext-moscow.ru/">DotNext</a></b> will take place there <b>on November 12-13</b> .  And the "veterans" of the Moscow DotNext already on these dates may notice that the event will be different from last year: now it has become two days.  And what else can we tell about it now, five months before the event itself?  Under the cut - the names of the speakers, topics and other details. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h2>  Two days </h2><br>  In the spring, we tried a two-day format on the St. Petersburg DotNext - and everything went <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/company/jugru/blog/329562/">fine there</a> .  ‚ÄúTwo-day‚Äù does not mean ‚Äújust multiply the number of reports by two‚Äù (by loading viewers to a state where it is no longer possible to perceive information). 
      <br>
        <script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>
        <ins class="adsbygoogle"
          style="display:block; text-align:center;"
          data-ad-layout="in-article"
          data-ad-format="fluid"
          data-ad-client="ca-pub-6974184241884155"
          data-ad-slot="8945601208"></ins>
        <script>
          (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
        </script>
      <br>
      "Two-day" means that with an increase in the number of reports, you can also give more "air" by extending breaks: you no longer need to "shove everything possible into a single day."  In this case, the viewer may even have time to ask the speaker in the discussion area, not being late for the next report, and simply take a break before diving into the flow of information with new forces. <br><br><h2>  Topics </h2><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/077/f7f/353/077f7f3537a4456382cdb8e0e6c9fc1b.jpg"><br><br>  What will they talk about?  If you have already found yourself on DotNext, then in general you can imagine a range of topics - from hardcore .NET ‚Äúintestines‚Äù to the ‚Äúnew frontiers‚Äù up to HoloLens.  But we note three points: <br><br>  Firstly, according to feedback collected from previous DotNext, we saw that you do not have enough reports about the architecture.  This time 3-4 reports on this are supposed. <br><br>  Secondly, after the St. Petersburg DotNext there were reviews in the spirit of "there were few" hardcore "reports."  This is not entirely true; the absolute number of such reports has not decreased - the conference itself has simply grown at the expense of other areas, so the share of ‚Äúhardcore‚Äù in the program has slightly decreased.  But we take into account this feedback and try to make sure that in each time slot there is a ‚Äúdifficult‚Äù report, so that hardcore fans will not be bored. <br><br>  And thirdly, the .NET-world itself is now developing so rapidly that it continuously throws up new topics.  Say, by November releases of .NET Core 2.0 and .NET Standard 2.0 should take place, and the Rider IDE should finally come out (and at the event, in all likelihood, there will be speakers from Microsoft and from JetBrains).  So worry, that "will be the same as last time" is clearly not worth it. <br><br><h2>  Speakers </h2><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/41c/64f/5da/41c64f5dac43434886b34153da519e3c.jpg"><br>  Of course, five months before the event it is impossible to communicate the full composition of the speakers, and one of the reasons for this is the severity of our program committee.  Even in the case of ‚Äústar‚Äù speakers, he will ensure that a specific report is strong enough for the DotNext program, so anyone can ‚Äúfall off‚Äù.  But something can be said with a high degree of confidence - first of all, about those speakers who have already loved viewers at previous DotNext, often getting into the top 5 most highly rated with their reports: <br><br><ul><li>  <b>Sasha <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/users/goldshtn/" class="user_link">Goldshtn</a> Goldstein</b> (Sela Group) - probably, it is not particularly required to represent him.  The author of the book ‚ÄúPro .NET Performance‚Äù has spoken with us many times already, and each new report has been well received.  So we look forward to it in November. </li><li>  <b>Andrew <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/users/dreamwalker/" class="user_link">DreamWalker</a> Akinshin</b> (JetBrains) - another public favorite, willingly telling at least about basic arithmetic operations, even about working with memory.  We still cannot tell what his theme will be this time - but we are already sure that many will be interested. </li><li>  <b>Roman Nevolin</b> (EPAM) - but in this case we can say more specifically about the topic: Roman tells about the ‚ÄúF # internals‚Äù.  So lovers of ‚Äúfunctionalism‚Äù will not feel left out among the heaps of C # developers. </li><li>  <b>Dmitry Soshnikov</b> (Microsoft) - the last time Dmitry spoke about ‚Äúchat bots and artificial intelligence‚Äù, he pleased many with the content of the report and his manner of presentation.  Now the content will be new - but the style, we hope, will not go anywhere! </li></ul><br>  And a couple of names that we cannot yet fully confirm, but which I already want to pay attention to: <br><br><ul><li>  <b>Dino Esposito</b> - like Dmitri, is very pleased with the audience with its expressiveness.  But the severe program committee DotNext has yet to be fully satisfied that the matter will not be limited to expressiveness, and the content of the speech will be matched. </li><li>  <b>Adam Sitnik</b> (Powel) - here is an interesting story: Adam spoke at DotNext three times already, and each subsequent report received from the audience higher than the previous one.  As a result, starting with the average results, in the spring St. Petersburg DotNext it was in the top 5 reports of the conference with the theme ‚ÄúMy awesome journey in open source‚Äù.  Now his experience of performances can also be called ‚Äúawesome journey‚Äù!  If he is at the November event, it will be interesting to look at the ratings of the audience in this case. </li></ul><br><br><h2>  Remote performance </h2><br>  Of course, conferences are largely about personal presence and communication.  However, sometimes a situation arises when an excellent foreign speaker with a very attractive report in principle cannot fly.  And in this case, the only option left is for the audience to see this report: arrange a video chat. <br><br>  We have not practiced this before.  However, the success of <b>Jeffrey Richter</b> ‚Äôs ‚Äúremote performance‚Äù at Codefest made us wonder.  A key component of our conferences was the discussion zones, where the speaker can be questioned after his speech - and if we provide the ‚Äúremote‚Äù discussion zone to Richter, for many it would be a convenient opportunity to ask the legend of the .NET world. <br><br>  In this regard, there is a question for you: does this idea seem attractive to you?  If the conference had a ‚Äúremote‚Äù report from a well-known speaker, who would not otherwise have gotten, would this improve your impression of the event or not? <br><br><h2>  Sasha Goldstein Training </h2><br>  Sasha will come not only to the conference itself: on the eve of it, on November 11, he will hold a separate one-day training.  The exact topic has not yet been selected - and you can participate in its selection.  There are the following options: <br><br><ul><li>  Production Performance and Troubleshooting of .NET Applications </li><li>  Making .NET Applications Faster with ETW </li><li>  Mastering .NET Performance Tools </li><li>  Mastering .NET Debugging with Visual Studio </li></ul><br>  Which of these trainings would you most like to attend?  Answer us <a href="https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/B959FMK">on SurveyMonkey</a> and you will help make the event as useful as possible. <br><br><h2>  Call for Papers </h2><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/afb/025/a07/afb025a0793041cab289341ad6cfa443.jpg"><br><br>  If you like not only to receive knowledge, but also to share it, pay attention: now is the time <a href="https://dotnext-moscow.ru/callforpapers/"><b>to submit a report to us</b></a> !  Although our strict program committee includes only really good performances in the program, the same committee helps the speakers bring their promising developments to the appropriate level - so even if you do not have much experience in speaking, but there is an interesting topic, do not be afraid to apply. <br><br>  And if you have experience, refer to the video recordings of reports that you did earlier, and this will significantly speed up the decision making by the program committee. <br><br>  The main requirement: your report should be useful to other developers.  We are interested in reports on the following topics: <br><br><ul><li>  Developer Tools and Frameworks </li><li>  CLR internals </li><li>  CoreCLR </li><li>  Performance &amp; GC </li><li>  Cross-platform Development </li><li>  Desktop Applications Development </li><li>  Mobile Applications Development </li><li>  Automated Testing </li><li>  Dependency Management </li><li>  Build tools </li></ul><br><h2>  Program and Registration </h2><br>  The conference program will gradually be replenished, and you can follow its most current status on <a href="https://dotnext-moscow.ru/">the</a> DotNext Moscow <a href="https://dotnext-moscow.ru/">website</a> .  And now the <a href="https://dotnext-moscow.ru/tickets">sale of tickets</a> is open on this site - and over time, their price will rise, so now you can have time to buy at the most favorable conditions.  We will be waiting for you in November with badges at the ready! <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/4ba/258/80a/4ba25880a6914a26a4ce0f9b0c87ded0.jpg"></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/331318/">https://habr.com/ru/post/331318/</a></p>
