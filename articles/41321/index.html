  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Wimax in Moscow - testing the Yota network and first results</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Colleagues, welcome. <br><br>  Let me remind you, for those who are not very interested in the topic, that at the beginning of September the presentation of the <a href="http://www.yota.ru/ru/">Yota</a> brand took place.  Under this brand, the Scartel company creates and promotes the wimax network in Moscow and St. Petersburg.  In the near future, Yota is recruiting a team of 2000 people for official testing of the grid in different areas of the two capitals.  Naturally, I also signed up for testers, and wait until they call me. <br><br>  But the point is that I managed to get this wimax modem from Yota a few weeks before the start of official testing.  I am in no way officially connected with the company, so this is a simple and amusing combination of circumstances, and my testing, so to speak, is quite unofficial. <br>  And how to dispose of the information received?  That's right, to make for all to see.

    <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  I will say right away, from a technical or financial point of view, I am not able to evaluate the service and I will not.  Then dozens of it-sites and hundreds of simple bloggers will do it.  I think that in the near future there will be a lot of thematic reports on the network: the topic is delicious and there will be thousands of testers.  Now more important is the fact of the emergence and formation of such a service in Moscow as wimax. <br>  Therefore, I just took my Asus 1000h, usb wimax modem, headset and went outside in search of a connection, as a simple consumer of the services I needed. <br><br>  On the <a href="http://www.yotatester.ru/">YotaTester.ru</a> website <a href="http://www.yotatester.ru/">,</a> I present to you the first results in the form of a simple blog + maps from a large G. Despite the fact that the entire grid is only on the verge of beta testing, in some areas the signal quality is amazing, you really realize that you have really something new and serious in the market of access to the Network.  I would like the owner of the company not to lower the bar and develop at the same pace in order to cover most of Moscow by the New Year (well, Peter, of course).  But for justice, it must be said that the full-fledged ‚Äúeternal ether‚Äù is still far away.  There are dead zones, there are too many houses in our capital, but to judge strictly the service at this stage is not serious.  Now it is a new toy that entices with its uniqueness and potential of possibilities. <br><br>  Testing I most often spend at night, when you can safely ride through the streets and districts, and stop to check the connection and the average speed of the network in any place convenient to me.  I define the quality of the network manually, I did not write any automatic scripts.  I also often leave the car outside to check the quality of the video signal in Skype.  To call from the night, already cold, the streets in Moscow, to St. Petersburg or Australia, and to see and hear the ocean, the sensations are amazing. <br><br>  Peace Avenue.  Skype call to Guatemala, in Moscow - 3 am, across the ocean - 17 pm. <br><img src="http://www.yotatester.ru/img/gvat3.jpg" alt="image"><br>  Sorry, carried away. <br><br>  Since in the near future there will be a lot of official testers, I invite everyone to join the formation of a single unofficial <a href="http://www.yotatester.ru/karta-wimax/">wimax card</a> in Moscow (and maybe in St. Petersburg, if there is <a href="http://www.yotatester.ru/karta-wimax/">someone</a> willing to lead St. Petersburg testers).  And for those who want to just watch as a new world appears on the map of Moscow, welcome. <br><br>  Who is interested in the details of testing, or have any questions, write, share everything that I know in the comments or in the mail.  Moreover, if there is something to supplement, I will be happy to hear for self-development. <br><br>  thank you </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/41321/">https://habr.com/ru/post/41321/</a></p>
