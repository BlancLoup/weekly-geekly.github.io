  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Likbez about SEO. Part one, a variety of sites.</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Good day, habracheloveki.  Unfortunately, the mention of SEO causes the same bunch of trolling, as well as bad words about an apple or good words about the main villainous software of the melkosoft.  As it turned out above, many people simply do not understand what it is, what it is for, why promotion is bad and why it is done.  In fact, everything is simple, I will try to explain it to you. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  To begin with, we need to understand the meaning for which dora, sattelites, MFA, and MFS sites are being created, I think it‚Äôs worth giving them a brief description just in case. <br><br><ul><li>  <strong>MFA (made for adsense)</strong> - as the name implies, this type of site is created for making profit from contextual advertising, such as Google ads, Yandex Direct, runner.  In various niches, bids per click can range from a cent to tens of dollars, which means the webmaster is most interested in increasing traffic, but there is no goal to create high-quality content.  The main thing is to attract a visitor and make them click on advertisements with various methods. </li><li>  <strong>MFS (made for sape)</strong> - sites for the sale of links from exchanges similar to Sapa.  Here are important indicators of the site (TCI and PR), as well as the number of pages.  Positions of such sites are not required, and therefore it is rather difficult to see it in the issuance, only at the extremely low-frequency request with exact entry. </li><li>  <strong>Doorway</strong> - The shortest living sites.  The goal is to slap a lot of traffic one-time, directing it to affiliate programs or your websites.  Most often using a redirect. </li><li>  <strong>Sattelity</strong> - sites satellites of the main site.  They can live as promotional sites, but more often the task is to create a grid with the possibility of affixing thematic anchors to your site, which, in turn, can raise the issue. </li><li>  <strong>Affiliate (promo) sites</strong> - a site that advertises someone else's service in order to get% of the attracted client.  Such a site should be as high as possible, but the quality of information should also be monitored.  Otherwise, it is clear that you will not find customers. </li><li>  <strong>Selling sites</strong> - online shopping.  There is a double-edged sword, on the one hand, targeted traffic is also necessary, and on the other hand, trash traffic can be beneficial in the form of a purchase.  The entire niche is usually covered, even if it is not strictly targeted.  But good stores, as a rule, have a lot of useful information. </li><li>  <strong>Business card company (site services)</strong> - something like a promotional site, as described.  In addition to the informative goal, most often, it also promotes any of its goods.  And advertising on the Internet, as you know, is much cheaper than off of an advertising company. </li></ul><br><br>  We will not consider blogs and portals, they, as a rule, do not advance by optimization and do not litter the Internet.  Exceptions are the above sites, but made on a blogging basis.

      And so what we see. <br><br>  The main problem in occasional junk delivery is MFA sites, doorway pages and, to a lesser extent, online stores.  It is, in principle, understandable.  If dora are designed for RF requests, then under normal use of a search engine, with the ability to make a request, we will not see them, and besides, their main niche is adult subject. <br>  Online stores, though they come across in commercial inquiries, but at the same time, using mobile phones as an example, they often contain the required information (characteristics, approximate price, etc.). <br>  It turns out that the biggest misfortune are MFA sites?  I guess, yes.  Their share of the trash is quite large, largely due to the fact that it allows <u>even a schoolboy to</u> earn money, sometimes not small.  Those.  such sites open up the possibility of earning online.  In principle, if everything were so simple and at no cost, then people would probably have already stopped working) They work, and therefore they need skills.  But that‚Äôs another story, which I‚Äôm not going to raise here. <br><br>  And so, the trouble of the Internet - MFA.  Who is guilty?  Optimizer?  Search engine optimization?  Not.  SEO is only a way to make money, as is context trading.  The one who creates the opportunity is usually to blame.  And this is exactly the search engines themselves.  After all, just the search engines own all the major context trading companies.  They created a condition.  They have increased competition.  So do not say that search engine promotion is a fraud of search engines.  The search engines themselves offered to play this game.  And I want to note, you should not equate all SEO to mfa, mfs, etc., as almost all users of Habr do, good, high-quality and thematically advanced sites are many times more than the sullen shit in the top10.  Think yourself, if you had a business and the site would be the main supplier of customers, and the competition would be 50+ sites, would you use the services of professionals in the field of promotion?  I would - yes. <br>  _________ <br><br></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/51701/">https://habr.com/ru/post/51701/</a></p>
