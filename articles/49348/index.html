For those who do not spend time / money in the empty, pre-look for information on the Internet on competent resources.  In IT, for me, such a resource is Habr.  For each topic, you can see public opinion and choose the most rational decision.  What I actually do. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  And had to choose a project management system.  It was viewed a lot of options.  In total, we managed to test more than a dozen more or less worthwhile products.  As a result, the choice of pairs for several projects.  And after the New Year offer, I stopped at <a href="http://www.webasyst.ru/">WebAsyst</a> `e.  Full ammunition price of 12,500 rubles - a great option. <br><br>  Before buying, we compared the technical requirements, with the VPS server we use - you can set.  Read the documentation, looked at the site and forum.  Not a word that the installation will require any skills from us.  I note that we use a lot of products that are successfully installed and used.  So, the long-awaited purchase.

      Purchase turned into a long correspondence with technical support, which ended with what it began.  The text of my final letter is below.  I would just like to say that publishing a product is a business.  And business is not only the ability to develop, but also the ability to sell, provide adequate support, and develop the product.  The WebAsyst team is doing well with the second one.  Technical support managers, did not pursue the goal to solve my problem, their task is to respond to the letter.  And without a difference, solves this problem or not, the answer is given and great. <br><br>  Men, if after reading you get the impression that I am inflating them with elephant flies, or moreover, we are wrong in this situation, then please inform us.  I am quite self-critical, I will think about it. <br><br>  Letter: <br>  <i>Dear!</i>  <i>You are probably pleased to read messages written in a polite manner and in which the essence is summarized.</i>  <i>Me too.</i> <i><br><br></i>  <i>That's just the idiocy that has been happening for a day, does not quite fit into the framework of decency.</i>  <i>In short, we are not able to install WebAsyst on our WORKING server, on which we successfully put a ton of other PAID LICENSE products.</i>  <i>Moreover, this server meets all the requirements described on your site.</i> <i><br><br></i>  <i>I will not even emphasize that you are the first company that was able to take us out of the precarious state of calm in just one day, with your complete indifference.</i>  <i>Answers to our messages, written in normal Russian, resemble some kind of nonsense.</i> <i><br><br></i>  <i>Let's get down to business.</i>  <i>We need to install the WebAsyst package to the domain corp. *****. Ru.</i> <i><br><br></i>  <i>In ticket # 606465 we briefly outlined the essence of the problem, indicating the specific error that occurred, thinking that the problem is in us and the solution lies on the surface.</i>  <i>In response, of course, they received an answer that there were problems with our server (of course, after all, about 8 products were launched on it by chance).</i>  <i>Having duplicated the answer to the technical support of Rusonyx hosting, we continued the correspondence.</i> <i><br></i>  <i>So, ticket # 607070. The question to the point of insanity is simple - is it possible to install software if we provide data for access to the server.</i>  <i>Definitely not.</i>  <i>It's funny, but at least it was suggested that the problem is in OTHER.</i>  <i>In another so in another, we send data for access to FTP.</i> <i><br><br></i>  <i>Ticket # 607112. Well, what can I say, we made a fatal mistake - we didn‚Äôt describe in detail how to get on the data sent by FTP (they lead to the entire domain) on the subdomain that appeared in the first ticket.</i>  <i>In response, of course, we received the answer that there is no script on the server.</i> <i><br></i>  <i>Yeah, here we are fools - have fun.</i>  <i>We purchased the software, do not download it to the server, and we are surprised that nothing works.</i> <i><br><br></i>  <i>607170. This ticket dismayed me.</i>  <i>It was reported that the distributed distribution was not installed (during the ‚Äúlightning-fast‚Äù technical support answers, we repeatedly downloaded it again, tried to install it in manual and automatic mode, etc.).</i>  <i>And installing software is a paid service.</i>  <i>By the way, I don‚Äôt even deny that at that moment the newly uploaded files could be on the server, which they didn‚Äôt try to install 125 times.</i>  <i>It amazes me another thing, why the fearless manager of those supporting Victor, did not notice that the error was not in the installed script, but immediately after pressing the Enter key, after accepting the agreement.</i>  <i>Why you can not press these two keys yourself, and not talk about a paid service, and make sure that NOTHING is fixed.</i>  <i>I will even quote the answer:</i> <i><br><br></i>  <i>Nikolay, installation service costs 1250 rubles.</i>  <i>I thought that the script was already installed and I wanted to find the cause of the error.</i>  <i>Install the script yourself and send the text of the error.</i> <i><br></i>  <i>respectfully</i> <i><br></i>  <i>- Victor</i> <i><br><br></i>  <i>Needless to say, in the next ticket 607245, I reported an error with which it all started.</i>  <i>Funny little.</i> <i><br><br></i>  <i>And here is the apotheosis.</i>  <i>They tell me that some changes have been made to a kind of magic file located on the server - try it.</i>  <i>I try, the same eggs, only in profile.</i>  <i>In other words - the same mistake!</i>  <i>Was it difficult to verify these magical changes on your own?</i> <i><br><br></i>  <i>Next ticket.</i>  <i>Funny yes?</i>  <i>Yes, another ticket, # 607310. I inform you that nothing has changed yet.</i>  <i>The answer is - where is your script?</i>  <i>A curtain.</i>  <i>Sorry, but this is idiocy.</i>  <i>The previous ten messages then forgive in general about what?</i> <i><br><br></i>  <i>So, dear technical support service, let us know what you need to provide in order to see the RESULT in response.</i> <i><br><br></i>  <i>Incidentally, it was mentioned that calls received by you are recorded.</i>  <i>Listen to the one that at 5:04 pm Moscow time (the time indicated in the client center is apparently from some other dimension), you can hear the information better by ear.</i> <br><br>  <b>UPDATE: The situation is resolved by disabling safe_mode for php.</b> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/49348/">https://habr.com/ru/post/49348/</a></p>
