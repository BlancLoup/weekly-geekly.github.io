And for all my objections to the usefulness of my occupation, I always received only surprised eyes and a twist with my finger at my temple. <br><br>  And now, after 15 years, when the question of raising your own child loomed on the horizon, I decided once again to think about the role of computer (and everything that can be included in this concept) games in the development of a small person. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/b00/efa/4f6/b00efa4f6ea10b12fd3545a61b69b01e.jpg" alt="image"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  I will rank the obtained skills according to their relevance and necessity for the child.  I will try to exclude games that carry along with positive and negative in the form of, for example, shooting at people.

      So, let's start with the most classic and necessary things, such as early arcades like Arkanoid and Tetris. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/dc7/e3f/6fa/dc7e3f6fafda55bdb6388baf47f12b2a.jpg" alt="image"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/47a/f50/882/47af508820d2efa0e796edfee4d02dcc.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  These games, which are simple at first glance, develop the hand motor skills, logic, the ability to think a few steps forward, to assess the situation.  These skills are fundamental in the life of each person, of course, it is possible to instill all these skills with other methods, but if the child likes to learn them through the game, then why bother him. <br><br>  Go ahead.  Reaction games such as Earthworm Jim, Dangerous Dave (I promised to exclude shooting, but here we shoot cartoon square zombies, that doesn't count) or Prince of Persia, in which, despite the slow pace of the game, you had to have excellent reflexes to jump over many obstacles and avoid traps.  Also, the child learns endurance and becomes less careless in life situations. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/e08/cd9/cec/e08cd9cec741877b6f9b88173046e226.jpg" alt="image"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/663/6c9/5f5/6636c95f538cda41483e9df34e9457a2.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Socializing games.  There is a clear primacy I would give the series The Sims.  After playing this game, the child begins to accept primary social values ‚Äã‚Äãlike ‚ÄúThe house must be kept clean‚Äù, ‚ÄúIf it does not learn, then you will not be taken to work‚Äù, and ‚ÄúIf you don‚Äôt work, then you will have nothing to buy‚Äù. always want to.  Moreover, the Sims give the child a first idea of ‚Äã‚Äãthe relationship with the opposite sex, explaining innocently that girls need to behave well and give them compliments. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/508/882/7d4/5088827d4761db00c8a9623bcd63ccb4.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Also to this category to some extent include a number of MMORPG.  Those of them that prioritize teamwork, such as WOW or Dota2.  The child begins to understand that having even the coolest elf level 80, one in life does not succeed.  It is necessary to look for friends, at least situational, who will help you.  And this is already the ability to negotiate, to conduct dialogues, what a feeling of a collective. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/71f/007/08d/71f00708de2779e483b53fad7f222439.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  From myself I will add that the same opportunity is <a href="https://www.shkolnaya-karta.ru/">provided by the</a> <a href="https://www.shkolnaya-karta.ru/app">‚ÄúSchoolboy‚Äù</a> application from <a href="https://www.shkolnaya-karta.ru/">‚ÄúSmiles.School card‚Äù</a> .  It is intended both to rally children in one information field, providing them with a platform for exchanging data, and to improve their communication through the built-in games for several players.  The application also performs all the functions of the <a href="https://www.shkolnaya-karta.ru/journal_parents">"Electronic diary"</a> for the child. <br><br>  Next, I would put a whole set of quest games - from the earliest to the modern.  Such as Neverhood, Grim Fandango, Myst, Syberia or Broken Age.  Here I would add ‚ÄúSpace Rangers‚Äù, with their endless text quests.  All these toys combine the tasks that they pose to the player.  This is solving puzzles and unraveling puzzles.  Ability to conduct dialogues.  With the passage of such quests, the child develops visual memory and trains logical thinking.  The same effect can be obtained if you sit him down for solving crossword puzzles and sudoku, but what the child will do more willingly: it is not clear what purpose to fill the squares on the sheet or to solve the mythical mystery of the magic city in order to save humanity? <br><br>  By the way, pathological craving for helping your neighbors and saving those who are in trouble is a side, but very pleasant bonus from such games. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/cc6/b94/294/cc6b94294cbe5cca17daca802ac0a17c.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Now let's move on to the ‚Äútoy whistles‚Äù, as my mother would say, who can help the child specifically during school.  I specifically do not include in the list of those that were developed as educational, only entertaining. <br><br>  For example, in order to interest a child in studying physics or chemistry, games like the modern Amazing Alex are suitable.  Here he learns where it is necessary to apply force in order to obtain the desired result, or that, when heated or cooled, substances can change their properties.  Well, or that the cat does not need to throw off the bowling ball. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/f0f/b84/8a9/f0fb848a9b09d25ee7300f6278aa49c8.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  To teach your child the basics of biology, I advise you to acquaint him with the creation of EA Games - Spore.  The game will tell him about the theory of evolution, microbiology, the animal world, food chains and much more. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/c83/1bc/0df/c831bc0dfc870ad15dd81a9ec15c82bd.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Total strategies, such as Europa Universalis, Victria, Victory Day, Civilization, or the Total War series of games, can help your child with history and geography.  You will not have time to look back, as your child will independently google the years of the Napoleonic wars, the causes of the Franco-Prussian conflicts and the Ottoman border until 1908. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/2f6/c20/8ad/2f6c208ad434436a9da2418ea3c0d7ac.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  As you can see, not everything is bad that is played on a computer.  Above, I wrote about the fact that there are games that carry a negative in themselves, but there are also those to which children should not be admitted categorically.  Your task is to inculcate in the child a love for the right entertainment, and there is a proven way here: play with him! <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/aa7/993/f4a/aa7993f4ab12c4bc887b34ef41fb1b41.jpg" alt="image"></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/377109/">https://habr.com/ru/post/377109/</a></p>
