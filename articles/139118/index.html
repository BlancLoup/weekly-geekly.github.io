But still I think someone will be helpful article. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a>  I read the article <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/ebay/138876/">habrahabr.ru/blogs/ebay/138876</a> , where the author said everything correctly, but there are also difficulties with the return of money through PayPal. <br><br>  For example: they bought a phone, when it arrived at the post office they took the parcel, which at first glance was a completely normal package, even without visible damage.  They came home dug, and there a stack of cut paper or a brick instead of a phone.  Maybe people who do not know or have not read about the problems of mailing will be a shock.  Then you can write to the seller and Paypal, and even run a brawl on the mail.  BUT you have already signed the parcel receipt paper, so it‚Äôs yours and you do what you want. <br>  Here it is quite difficult to bring the matter to the return of your money.  Where did Paypal know that it was not you who came home and put a brick instead of a phone.  Sometimes you even need to send copies of your application to the police to PayPal.

      Let's go back better to how to protect yourself, and not to what to do when it's too late.  It is better to do everything on time and be one step ahead. <br><br>  Always look at the rating and reviews, as mentioned in the article above.  Some lots may look cheaper, but people also bargain more with good sellers.  Although it is possible to buy goods from a seller with a small rating, it is cheaper only because more people hunt for the goods from those checked with a cool rating and this also increases the price. <br><br>  For example, personally, when I buy goods more than $ 100, I take the following factors to attention: <br><br>  1. Seller rating and number of sales.  If the seller for the last six months hasn‚Äôt sold anything to himself is already looking for another (an exception can be considered when only this seller has the goods you need and no alternative).  It may hurt me neat, but there are cases when people's accounts break down and people are separated from other people's accounts: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/4f5/cff/772/4f5cff77248195d0639f22f032068c74.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  2. Well study the lot, view photos, description (especially important for used goods).  Never rush to the name, the seller can write a lot to the name, the main thing is that the description is from the seller below.  There are all the details.  It is necessary to read carefully and that's it.  When buying firm, branded items, pay attention to this ‚ÄúBrand‚Äù item (in detail in the screenshot), there you should write the brand that you are buying correctly, without any errors.  This will give protection if a fake aka Abibas comes: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/62d/fd2/a1d/62dfd2a1d27415003b81b816069b612f.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  There were cases when people bought boxes from iphone 4s for 500-600 dollars.  Basically, for such lots, newbies were traded, which didn‚Äôt look that even the title of the lot says box.  Yes, and in the description says that the phone is not included in the kit, the lot is designed according to the rules, in fact, not a divorce, but such cunning minds, that is invented and play on the carelessness of beginners. <br><br>  3. If in doubt, you can see the listing seller.  For example: if all of its sales history is mainly spare parts for cars, and here he put out a new macbook, a bit strange. <br><br>  Always more confidence, if you buy a phone from the seller who sells them.  This may be my opinion, I do not force anyone to do just that, I just think those who are just studying ebay will find it useful. <br><br>  Something I strongly departed, from what was spinning in my head about 30 minutes ago, but I already wrote so much (for me this is a lot, the first article is all the same). <br><br>  Let's move closer to what I originally wanted to write. <br><br>  When buying, for example, a phone, ask the seller to pack well, as the postal workers are not very worried about the parcel, it happens that they come as if they were playing football.  Even a video on youtube is about it <br><iframe width="420" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/MReC1XqwJrQ%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700021,15700186,15700190,15700253,15700255,15700259&amp;usg=ALkJrhiuZx3NAfZqHxCyKeYsdKcjzK_SBA" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br>  I hope these are isolated cases. <br><br>  Second, ask to send the track number of the item after the seller has sent it, this will give you the opportunity to track the movement of the purchase. <br><br>  Third, ask to remember to weigh the parcel in the mail and send you how much the parcel weighs. <br>  Next, wait for the long-awaited package. <br>  Upon arrival at the post office, you can arm yourself with a friend (mom, dad, girlfriend, wife, child) with a camera (you can use the phone).  Then understand why. <br>  Often, mailers do not even want to show you the package until you sign up for it.  But no, the <b>main thing is not to subscribe</b> ahead of time. <br>  Ask them to show the package in a polite manner, <b>see if there are any traces of the autopsy</b> , ask if there were any documents with a parcel about the difference in weight (the parcel may be ‚Äúthinner‚Äù already on the way to your unit).  Ask to weigh the parcel, and compare with the data that your seller gave you.  The data should not be much different. <br>  If the weight does not match or there are visible traces of the opening of the parcel - this is already an excuse for opening the parcel before receipt, ask to open it under act 51. <br>  <a href="http://ru.wikisource.org/wiki/%25D0%259F%25D0%25BE%25D1%2587%25D1%2582%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B2%25D1%258B%25D0%25B5_%25D0%25BF%25D1%2580%25D0%25B0%25D0%25B2%25D0%25B8%25D0%25BB%25D0%25B0_%25D0%25BE%25D1%2582_22.04.1992/%25D0%2593%25D0%25BB%25D0%25B0%25D0%25B2%25D0%25B0_39">In paragraph 596 of Act 51,</a> you can read more. <br>  Mailers may refuse to open and say that they hear for the first time about act 51, then we ask to call the authorities and already communicate with them. <br>  Why was it necessary to take a friend with a video camera or phone in order to film the autopsy process (but these are already strong measures, I personally wanted but forgot to do this, I will describe my story below). <br>  If the attachment is present, say thank you and sign the paper. <br>  If not, then we don‚Äôt forget to take act 51, compiled by postal workers, it may be useful for Paypal. <br>  If so, the chances that your dispute about non-receipt will be taken in your direction is 95% or even more. <br>  5% I put it on just that, all the same in every joke there is some truth: <br><img src="http://www.petcomments.com/ccimages/PPS-Cartoon1.gif" alt="image"><br><br>  EMS (express mail service) is a separate story, express mail is often stolen by an attachment, even thoughts are circulated among people who often deal with this that first class mail and priority mail are more reliable. <br><br>  My advice, by express mail, to refuse the courier, and personally pick up at the office, since those actions that I described cannot be done with the courier.  Courier has no right to open parcels. <br>  We do the same thing that I described. <br><br>  Personally, when I received my purchased phone, when I said that I would not sign anything yet and would like to open the package under the act, I was told that I was a scoundrel and they had nothing like that.  Then there was the call of the main one, which was already assembled to go home (time 17.55, they work until 19.00), with difficulty in raised voices (both I was and I) achieved an autopsy, gave a piece of paper, filled it, but <b>did not subscribe</b> , but they wanted and waited until I signed up, flatly said no.  He opened it, he wrote everything well, got into the trail that I was angry and bad.  But it was all the same. <br>  updt: By the way, I forgot to write that the parcel opened up under the pretext that I insisted that it was opened, it was too wrinkled, the weight came together. <br><br>  <b>So we conclude:</b> <br>  1. We do not sign anything until we are convinced that what is inside really what they bought; <br>  2. Weight check; <br>  3. Check the package for traces of the autopsy. <br><br>  It seems everything is written, I want to wish you that your purchases would always be successful and you only read about such cases on the Internet and just knew what to do in such cases. <br>  Do not kick much, if there are mistakes, I will be grateful for the instructions on them. <br>  Successes! </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/139118/">https://habr.com/ru/post/139118/</a></p>
