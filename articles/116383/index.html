Today I was driving from work and figured out how to explain intelligibly. <br><br>  Electric current flows through the wires just like water through pipes.  If you close the water in the tap, it puts pressure on the valve - in the electrical world it is ‚Äúvoltage‚Äù.  In this case, the sink is like the "earth" in the electrical world.  If we imagine a bipolar system, with a minus and a plus, then this is a pipe blocked by a partition in the middle, and the pressure increases not only on one side, but also falls on the other.  The partition at some point does not stand up - it is an electrical "breakdown".  The voltage source is something that creates pressure. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Current is in our analogy the speed of water in a pipe.  The faster the water moves, the greater the current.  If the valve is closed, the water does not move, regardless of what ‚Äúinlet‚Äù pressure will be (= voltage).  Therefore, the birds are free to sit on the wires and do not hit them with current - the current simply has nowhere to go.  If you open the valve - the water will break out.  In this case, the pressure will first fall, and then re-rise to a normal level.  But he will not be able to stop abruptly and the pressure will increase slightly, and then fall again - as a result, he normalizes.  These are transients.  Because of this, the bulbs burn, because when you turn on the light, the same thing happens, but with voltage and current.

      An analogue of resistance may be rust inside the pipe.  In short, this is something that prevents water from moving normally.  This can be very much and then the pipe turns into a dielectric.  Dielectrics are different - some pass badly, some very badly.  By the way, offtopic: ordinary distilled water - dielectric. <br><br>  You can understand how to conduct two current in parallel or in series connected resistance by presenting such clogged pipes placed in parallel or in series.  Imagine one heavily clogged pipe and one empty one.  Where will the water go?  Mostly by empty.  And the current is the same.  And if they are connected in series?  the water will still not be able to pass at a greater speed through the empty pipe, since the clogged one interferes further.  We remember that the current is the speed of the water. <br><br>  You can also remember how the lamp is arranged?  It's just a very bad conductive thin conductor.  In fact, a very thin clogged pipe in our analogy.  When this is a very powerful water flow, it heats the pipe.  In a light bulb, heat occurs such that the thread glows.  The energy of the current is converted into heat.  But what happens to the current at the "output"?  In the analogy with water, the speed drops, yes, and the current in the circuit also falls.  Here comes the notion of power.  The more powerful the current source (in analogy with water, the pumping motor), the less will be the loss of speed (current).  Recall the garland - there are many, many small light bulbs and often there is no current transducer, it is immediately plugged into the outlet.  Each individual light bulb will simply break from 220 volts, because the power will be such that the current heats its thread in a fraction of a second to a temperature above the melting point.  And if you put them consistently, then the ‚Äúspeed‚Äù of the flow will fall just enough to warm up to the level of the glow.  It is important here that either the current goes through the whole circuit, or it does not go at all.  Therefore, there is no such thing that the first light bulb, the one that is closer to the current source, feels somehow differently than the last one. <br><br>  What are diodes?  These are valves that open only in one direction.  If the water goes only in one direction, then the directly supplied diode transmits current-water, and it blocks it back.  The valve in this case, the Chinese goes - still a little bit skips. <br><br>  What is alternating current?  For DC, the ‚Äúbattery‚Äù pushes water in the plus, and at the minus it sucks, as a result, the current can flow along the circuit in an understandable direction.  Alternating current is when plus and minus change places.  In the outlet, they change back and forth 50 times per second. <br><br>  The disadvantage in analogy is that, unlike water in pipes, there is no movement of substance with current.  No molecules go anywhere.  Information is transferred - charge.  Also, this analogy is not easy to explain semiconductors and capacitors (although the latter is more or less possible). </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/116383/">https://habr.com/ru/post/116383/</a></p>
