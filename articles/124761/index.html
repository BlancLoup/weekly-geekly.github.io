  <section class="page js-page"><h1>The structure of the video security system ATM</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  As you know, ATMs, like any self-service banking devices installed in public places and providing cash withdrawal and storage, are, on the one hand, a source of increased danger for all participants in their service process, and on the other - among the most attractive objects for committing illegal acts by intruders.  These circumstances require ATM owners to solve a range of tasks related to ensuring the safe operation and maintenance of an ATM.  Among them are four main areas: <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  protection of collectors when loading / unloading ATMs in cash; <br><br>  protection of cardholders during operations; <br><br>  ATM protection against intruders;

      <br>
      fraud protection when performing operations. <br><br>  The first three points are fairly obvious.  Thus, the process of loading / unloading an ATM by collection services usually takes several minutes, during which cash collectors may be attacked by criminal elements.  Cardholders may be subject to a similar attack when receiving cash. <br><br>  Despite the means of protection provided by manufacturers, modern ATM still remains the target for attacks by criminal elements associated with attempts to steal cash and domestic vandalism.  According to statistics, in the UK alone, the number of successful attacks on ATMs in 2000 was more than eighty and continues to increase almost linearly with an increase in the number of installed ATMs. <br><br>  The last, fourth of the areas we have listed deserve a more detailed analysis.  ATM, being an automated self-service device, often becomes a tool that is actively used in various kinds of attempts to perform fraudulent cash withdrawals. <br><br>  Taking into account all these factors, it becomes obvious that in ensuring the safe operation of the ATM fleet, its owners are confronted with the need to use a whole range of organizational and technical measures of various levels: from using security systems in processing centers to perform transactions and software and hardware to resolve disputable situations , to protect the ATM site itself (to ensure the safety of operations in the service and service areas) and  It is controlled by means of video monitoring and alarm systems. <br><br>  Means of video control and alarm systems of ATMs play an important role in ensuring the safe operation of ATMs, video surveillance of the location of the ATM, registration and storage of information in the video archive, as well as prompt notification when abnormal situations occur. <br><br>  Each of the possible scenarios of actions of intruders (attacks to seize cash stored in an ATM, acts of vandalism against the ATM itself, attempted fraud during cash withdrawal operations) imposes its own specific requirements on the composition and characteristics of video monitoring and signaling ATMs.  Taking into account these requirements, a wide range of different sensors installed directly in an ATM (seismic sensor, thermal sensor, safe lock opening sensor under duress), installation of several video cameras, ensuring long-term storage of video archive and a number of other measures, in most cases regulated, should be foreseen. requirements of international payment systems. <br><br>  In addition, for effective and reliable operation of ATM video control tools, additional funds must be used to protect the ATM video control tools from exposure from intruders: blinding video cameras, darkening the ATM installation site, etc. <br><br>  The specificity of an ATM as a video control object establishes certain requirements for the video recording function.  The latter should include video recording simultaneously from several video cameras, initialization of video recording based on motion detection or burglar alarm sensors with the ability to ‚Äúroll back‚Äù the recording start time, cyclic recording mode (erasing obsolete archives and recording new ones to their place provided that the required archive storage period ). <br><br>  As already noted, with such a variety of tasks and possible problem situations, the need for an integrated, systematic approach to ensuring the safety of an ATM fleet is obvious. <br><br>  The structure of the VOSB (video-security system of the ATM network) includes two main components: the local video-security systems of ATMs (LVOS) and the centralized video monitoring system of the ATM networks (PAREC). <br><br>  The ATM LOC is located at the ATM installation site and provides for recording the primary video information from the video cameras to the video archive, displaying it at the LEFT observation point (if necessary), receiving, processing and recording messages from the ATM, as well as signals from sensors installed both inside and outside the ATM, the transmission of alarms and live video information files to the PARE when abnormal situations occur, receiving, processing requests to the video archive, generation and transmission of query results (video frames) in C  VC. <br><br>  The LVOS infrastructure consists of video cameras equipped with infrared illumination devices and light filters, a wide range of sensors for various purposes, as well as a block of a local video security system (BLVOS); <br><br>  The number of cameras connected to the system is determined by the specifics of the installation site and the mode of operation of the ATM (at the bank‚Äôs premises or outside it, the operating time of the ATM, the characteristics of the service area, etc.). provides an overview of the cash dispensing area and the ATM card reader area, recording the fact of cash dispensing and data on the card used. <br><br>  To ensure protection of video cameras from external influence on the part of intruders (blinding video cameras, darkening the place where the ATM is installed), light filters and infrared illuminators are used.  In such cases, the sensors installed directly in the ATM provide prompt notification of the system of signs of attempts detected by them to impede the operation of video surveillance equipment, as well as immediate activation of the alarm.  BLVOS is the main component of the local video security system.  Its functions include: recording video information in a video archive, presenting live video information to an operator, viewing a video archive and interacting with the centralized video control system of an ATM network. <br><br>  When installing an ATM outside the branch of the bank, the BLVOS is placed either directly at the ATM or at the premises of the ATM service area, and when installed at the bank - in a specially designated room. <br><br>  BLVOS provides recording of information in the video archive when the sensors of the ATM or sensors that protect the self-service area and the service area are triggered.  Similar actions are taken by the system when a motion (activity) detector is triggered, as well as when a message is received from an ATM control computer (UCB) about a transaction on an ATM. The video archive is placed on the hard-disk drives of the BLVOS.  The size of the archive is calculated taking into account the predicted intensity of recording in the video archive and is of the order of 40 - 100 GB under the condition of recording a black and white video image of the format 384x288.  The recording in the video archive is organized in the system on the principle of cyclic recording, which ensures the required duration of the storage of video information.  It is recorded in the video archive with reference to the number of the camera, date and time of recording, and when recording video information related to conducting an ATM transaction, linked to the details of the plastic card used, the transaction number and the date and time of the host.  Due to this, the search for video information in the video archive can be performed for each of the listed parameters. <br>  To digitize the video image, a special video input board is provided with integrated on-board relay inputs and outputs for connecting sensors and notification devices. <br><br>  The logic (scenario) of recording and displaying video information is determined by the setting of the WLLS and is consistent with the bank‚Äôs security services.  The system also provides for the triplex mode - simultaneous recording, display and viewing of video information. <br><br>  One of the most important functions of the BLVOS is interaction with the PAREC.  Thus, when sensors installed inside an ATM or outside an ATM trigger, the system sends ‚Äúalarm‚Äù messages to the PAREC.  BLVOS also provides reception from the PARH requests for receiving video information from the video archive and transmitting the requested video frame to the PAREC. <br><br>  There is a remote change in the settings of the BLVOS with PAREC.  Both regular ATM channels and additional channels (dial-up telephone lines, radio channels, etc.) can be used as communication channels between the BLVOS and the PAREC. <br><br>  An important role in the functioning of any integrated video security system of the ATM network is played by such a function as the implementation of self-diagnosis for a particular system malfunction.  To this end, the BLVOS is equipped with built-in controls for the technical state of the components of the local video security system.  In the event of failure of any component of the system, the corresponding message is provided to the PAREL. <br><br>  If necessary, video cameras and sensors can be connected to the BLVOS, ensuring the protection of other objects of the bank's division, which allows creating an integrated video-control system of the bank's division. <br><br><h4>  ATM security video system </h4><br><br>  The system of centralized video monitoring of the ATM network is located at the bank‚Äôs subdivision and ensures the reception and registration of ‚Äúalarm‚Äù messages from the LVOS, the generation and transmission of requests to the LVOS video archive, the reception and presentation of results to the video archive, viewing and printing the results video frames, remote control of operating modes of the LVOC, as well as transfer of information to the units of the Ministry of Internal Affairs of the Russian Federation in the event of emergency situations. <br><br>  The CCVC includes a centralized video control unit (BTSVK), which provides the basic functions of the CCVC, as well as the operator‚Äôs terminal, which includes a monitor, printer and keyboard. <br><br>  When a ‚Äúalarm‚Äù message is received from the LVOC, it is displayed on the BPC monitor and is recorded in the BCPC log (date, time, source), while the system provides for the ability to view the BCPC log. <br><br>  If necessary, the operator can provide a request for video information from the LVOS archive.  As the query parameters, as already noted, the date, time, card details or transaction number can be used.  The video security system of the ATM network has already been successfully tested and implemented at a number of facilities at the North-West Bank of Sberbank of Russia.  At the same time, during the operation of the system, it has proved in practice its ability to successfully solve the tasks of identifying persons who perform unauthorized operations with bank cards and commit vandalism against the bank‚Äôs ATMs. <habracut></habracut></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/124761/">https://habr.com/ru/post/124761/</a></p>
