  <section class="page js-page"><h1>A single interface for managing advertising on the site</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Monetizing your own project is always a challenge.  The easiest option is to put a teaser advertisement or context on it, and watch how much money is dripping into your pocket.  But the same option is often disappointing - the earnings are not worth the effort to acquire it.  Is teaser / contextual advertising so bad for monetizing websites?  Most likely, you just do not know how to cook it. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/513/9b2/e63/5139b2e63101d03447f8f9d09591c0a0.jpg"><br>  <i>Depending on the nature of your traffic, its sources and composition, the profitability of a particular ad network will change.</i> <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  How do you decide which ad network to connect?  Most likely, at first you remember about Yandex.Direct or Google Adsense.  Or maybe you need to connect a banner network - some ‚ÄúMarket Guide‚Äù or ‚ÄúTeaserNet‚Äù?  And how to choose from them? .. <br><br>  It would be much easier if the webmaster had the opportunity to connect all advertising systems at once, and manage them from one window, comparing their profitability.

    <h4>  <font color="d76552">‚ñå</font> <font color="000000">For this we invented <a href="http://www.advertone.ru/">AdvertOne</a> (‚ÄúAdverton‚Äù)</font> </h4><br>  Our system is the same ‚Äúone window‚Äù: we support work with 26 different advertising networks, including TeaserNet, Google Adsence, Yandex.Direct, Market Gid, Medianet, PayClick, GlobalTeaser, Direct / ADVERT, VisitWeb, BodyClick, AdSyst, Recreativ "," Gnezdo.ru ", as well as all popular advertising formats, including banners 240x400, 728x90, 198x260, context, teaser and others. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/2ae/46b/31c/2ae46b31ce7566fa709737a4fb162b05.png"><br>  <i>This is our friendly interface.</i> <br><br><h4>  <font color="3eb5f1">‚ñå</font> <font color="000000">How it works</font> </h4><br><ol><li>  You take the ad unit code of each ad network you want to test. </li><li>  Copy them in the form of creating an advertising container in your personal account in AdvertOne <br>  <i>Of course, in order for the comparison to be correct, you need to choose the same subject, format, and other key parameters of the ads (for example, banners 240x400, tourism, or the context on the subject of ‚Äúchildren's clothes, Moscow‚Äù)</i> </li><li>  Add additional settings - slider, glowing borders, shaking ads, the effect of approaching and snowflakes <blockquote>  The harsh truth of the advertising market: more annoying methods of advertising are <i>sometimes</i> more effective.  As the owner of the resource, you decide where to draw the line in the ratio of comfort for users and profitability of your resource.  But keep in mind that for advertising Yandex or Google, the use of "special effects" is prohibited by the rules and may lead to a ban. </blockquote></li><li>  The code of the created container is placed on your site. </li><li>  Rotation of all ad networks will occur within this block. </li><li>  All you have to do is compare advertising revenues, shutting down less profitable ones and leaving more profitable systems. </li></ol><br><h4>  <font color="d76552">‚ñå</font> <font color="000000">A / B testing</font> </h4><br>  Having decided on which ad network brings in more money per 1000 impressions, you can start looking for the perfect selling formula. <br><br><blockquote>  Not necessarily the most advantageous context.  It depends on the parameters and sources of traffic on your site: teaser ads work better for younger audiences.  If your visitors are dominated by a particular search engine, then the corresponding context will be more efficient, since it takes into account their query history. </blockquote><br>  In the same ad unit, you are no longer posting ads of different systems, but experimenting with the possible settings chosen: for example, changing the subject, fonts, adding and removing pictures, and so on - as far as ad network settings allow - until your ad efficiency and earnings from it will not be the maximum. <br><br><h4>  <font color="3eb5f1">‚ñå</font> <font color="000000">If necessary, repeat</font> </h4><br>  Having found the ideal formula, you can, for example, rerun advertisements from other systems in rotation to find out if something has changed and adjust your policy if necessary. <br><br><h4>  <font color="d76552">‚ñå</font> <font color="000000">Support almost any code</font> </h4><br>  In addition to the list of supported ad networks, our functionality is suitable for almost any teaser, banner and contextual advertising, including the ‚Äúdark horse‚Äù of the advertising market - <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/169267/">RTB</a> .  We have not specifically tested the codes of RTB networks specifically, but there are no principal contraindications for them, so if you are not eager to test the capabilities of modern Internet advertising technologies, you can try adding the code of the RTB block or any other advertising network you need to rotate.  If problems arise, we will only be grateful for <a href="http://advertone.ru/support/">feedback</a> . <br><br><h4>  <font color="3eb5f1">‚ñå Reefs</font> </h4><br>  AdvertOne is not yet the ‚ÄúMake Money‚Äù button (‚Äúfor now‚Äù - because we are already working on it, seriously). <br><br><ul><li>  For technical reasons, which we will discuss later, we do not offer management of all your registrations in one place.  Those.  to connect, for example, to the Adsense and Medianet Directive, you will need to register there and create a code that you then transfer to your personal account on the site. </li><li>  You can see the statistics of advertising spin on our website, but the amount of money earned still remains in your personal account on the corresponding network‚Äôs website. </li></ul><br>  And yet, "Adverton" offers a very necessary functionality: <br><br><ol><li>  Dozens of ad networks in one ad unit make it possible to objectively compare their effectiveness - after all, if you just put two ad units next to it, for example, Yandex and Google, then the objectivity of the comparison will already be broken, because  both the location and the fact that there are more ad units will affect clickability.  Turning them off in one block makes the conditions of the experiment being conducted chemically pure - you find the optimal result just for your site. </li><li>  Additional visual effects for unscrewing ad teaser networks increase clickability </li><li>  In this case, your money - only yours.  We do not enter into the process of mutual settlements with your advertising network and don‚Äôt take any commissions - our service is absolutely free. </li></ol><br>  As a result, the profitability of advertising grows significantly.  Now through ‚ÄúAdverton‚Äù they unscrew more than a million shows a day at 150 sites.  The average efficiency gain is about 30% per month.  <b>As our own experience has shown, by applying A / B testing, income from 1000 unik can be increased by a factor of 2-3 over several months.</b>  A little automation with our help - and you monetize your site no longer blindly, but knowing exactly where the money is.  The larger your resource - the more income. <br><br><h4>  <font color="d76552">‚ñå</font> <font color="000000">Our plans</font> </h4><br>  Of course, we plan to earn.  Having accumulated statistics, we will launch an automated traffic analysis and income maximization system - the same ‚ÄúMake Money‚Äù button, the algorithm that we are currently developing.  The subscription fee for its use will depend on the number of shows we unscrew.  However, the current functionality will remain free.  And therefore ... <br><br><h4>  <font color="000000">Try already rather: <a href="http://advertone.ru/account/registration/">advertone.ru/account/registration</a></font> </h4></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/214735/">https://habr.com/ru/post/214735/</a></p>
