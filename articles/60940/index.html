      Amazing times have come, finally IT-specialists can be used in raider operations along with riot police!  My friend in the office conducted a software check for licensed purity three times during the month: if they found problems, they formatted the disk without talking.  Bottom line: 90% of employees are dismissed, the company goes to a competitor for nothing.  Not that I persuade you to use open source software, but impressive, right?  The funny thing is that the commercial software in their company was not needed at all, they could easily use Linux and software for it. <a name="habracut"></a><br><br><h4>  Adjustable soft: can be cheaper </h4><br><br>  <i>-Waiter, check please</i> <i><br></i>  <i>- Coffee 20, a total of 50, turned out 300.</i> <i><br></i>  <i>- What means turned out?</i> <i><br></i>  <i>- The waiter - Well, it did not work out</i> <br><br>  Folk <br><br>  Each time, signing an order to purchase software in our company, I recall the following story.  At one time, our office was engaged in testing mobile phones, their graphic, sound and other media capabilities.  Testing was conducted for a large foreign customer, and everything had to be completely licensed, and, in particular, samples - tiny files in various formats that were played on the phone in order to assess whether the device is doing well.  When asked what I should provide to programmers in order to get licensed samples, they answered me with a two-page list of what they needed - and a video camera, for creating their own raw content and microphones from leading manufacturers, and headphones for 120 bucks per pair.  And at the end of the list <br>  software for editing samples.  There is nothing there: Sound Forge, Adobe Premiere, and Photoshop, with 8 licenses for each product, for the sum of something like $ 30,000 with a tail.  Slightly dumbfounded, I turned to the staff - could I somehow reduce this bill - grumbling a little, they were reassured and agreed to use VirtualDub, GIMP and Lame.  Such a replacement did not affect the quality of testing in any way.  And then we gave them money in <br>  a bonus - I will not lie, in part, but still I‚Äôve got quite normal bonuses. <br><br><h4>  Adjustable Soft: the cat in the bag </h4><br><br>  <i>The Negro plays chess on a computer and gets a checkmate on move 5.</i> <i><br></i>  <i>In the hearts of beats on the keyboard, shouting "Cursed Windows is again buggy !!!"</i> <br><br>  Folk <br><br>  For years, the existing pattern of software use and payment contains many pitfalls, and often we don‚Äôt notice any flaws in the well-established mechanisms for working with ordinary software - we put up with them.  Even a superficial glance is enough to understand that buying software is different from buying any other product, and the difference is not in favor of software.  One of the main drawbacks is that the purchased software may not be suitable for your business and the most unpleasant thing - you will know about it only after you try to implement this software.  One of the well-known examples of an ERP system is if you have adapted a business for this system, you will receive an increase in productivity, but if you are trying to adapt it for the current business scheme of your enterprise, then there will be no tangible gain, and in addition time will be lost and funds for the purchase of software.  Sometimes, one small detail can make the software completely unusable.  For example, one mobile retailer implemented a payment acceptance system, and it turned out that this system does not support CryptoPro, at that time, the only encryption system certified by the FSB.  It would seem, but so what, however, one of the retailer's patrons, the mobile operator, supported only CryptoPro, it was affected by the desire to work on certified products.  As a result, the software was not implemented, but the money and implementation efforts have already been spent. <br><br>  <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/open_source/63200/">To</a> be <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/open_source/63200/">continued</a> . </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/60940/">https://habr.com/ru/post/60940/</a></p>
