Three friends Ulla, Alex and Nick, in a familiar way, disorderly, sailed through the unfolding time-space of the reality of the planet Earth. </p><br><p>  Time smoothly rolled in and the space displayed the pictures of the existence of friends established in this temporary thickening.  The hot sun, the sea, unhurried, minor daily activities that had to be done to maintain existence, all this created a familiar and safe world. </p><br><p>  Alex touched the surrounding air and said: ‚ÄúYeah, so of course you can live to old age, but somehow it's boring, I want to stick out of space, other dimensions attract me with their inexplicability and non-representation. After all, everything you can imagine or explain is boring on its own, it is already in our time space. Let us marry him! " </p><br><p>  It was necessary to know that Ulla and Nick had been fighting for the constancy of being for several whole days and the fact that nothing unusual could be done and those actions that could be presented and explained should be done.  However, apparently they were very tired of this, because they immediately said. </p><br><p>  Ulla: "Dadada, we must take a run to think, we are now uh!". </p><br><p>  Nick, as the most stable of the restless trinity, slowly continued: "Oh, by the way, yesterday I chatted with an acquaintance wizard and he said that he had Rune that can turn-throw us beyond the limits of space-time directly into the inexplicable, but without guarantees, you can not get there and in general it is unclear what can happen. " </p><br><p>  Ulla thoughtfully asked: "If we from the current time of space want to get into the unexplainable, then where else can we be thrown except for the explainable or unexplainable?" </p><br><p>  Alex hastily said: "It‚Äôs better not to think about such a topic, let's just ask for a rune and use it, otherwise, if you think for a long time, then you can change your mind, but you really want to know the inexplicable." </p><br><p>  Since the friends apparently also really wanted to go there, no one began to question such strange logic and friends asked Nick to get this rune. </p><br><h2 id="korabl-materializuetsya-posredi-velikogo-nigde">  The ship materializes in the midst of the great nowhere. </h2><br><p>  Literally an hour later, Nick came back smiling, like a contented Cheshire cat who had just made fun of someone. </p><br><p>  ‚ÄúHow how?‚Äù Asked Ulla. </p><br><p>  Nick leisurely replied: ‚ÄúFour runes destroy the settled space-time continuum in my box.  It is necessary to agree only when we will destroy and where. ‚Äù </p><br><p>  ‚ÄúBut if we destroy space and time, then what's the difference where and when to destroy them?‚Äù Asked Alex. </p><br><p>  ‚ÄúVery large,‚Äù Ulla replied, ‚Äúif you destroy in a place where there is no tea, then there will be nothing to drink. So let's better destroy it in Alex‚Äôs stone house, because he has not only a house, but also a small garden and bushes and palm trees and tea and honey and even food. " </p><br><p>  Friends lived in different houses, and Alex, by chance, had a house similar to the manors from Marquez‚Äôs favorite novels.  He was standing not far from the seashore, in a field scorched by the sun, and he had a small garden where he could wander or lie down.  There was also a veranda with wicker armchairs in which it was so comfortable to sit in the evening with tea, living through the time-space passing by. </p><br><p>  "We agree - and Nick and Alex said, - this is a very smart decision. And we use runes in the evening, since it is better to destroy time in the space in the evening cool, in the afternoon and it is hot and stressful, and we do not like to strain ourselves." </p><br><p>  According to the philosophy of friends, stress meant that something was wrong in the world and this could only be fixed by one way - to stop straining.  Usually, other sentient beings, when they heard such a concept, began to argue and say that it was wrong, so friends didn‚Äôt tell anyone much about it. </p><br><p>  Since it was still noon, they decided to do different things and get together in the evening and activate the runes.  Destruction by destruction, but it‚Äôs necessary to work, otherwise no tea will be eaten, they reasonably decided, and they went back into the viscous current of ordinary space of time to perform the usual meaningless actions that magically brought about tea and cookies and food to reality. </p><br><p>  Some time passed, or even more correctly to write, some time passed, and then evening came and friends gathered in Alex's house.  Sitting on the veranda, they got the runes and began to examine them.  They were just inscriptions on small pieces of paper that had to be held loudly in hand.  To avoid accidental reading and activation of the runes, the inscriptions were made in very small print. </p><br><p>  At the same time, the words themselves didn‚Äôt matter, the magic component of the runes acted - when reading, it didn‚Äôt matter what written words came into effect a spell that did something.  In this case, as promised to friends, it was supposed to destroy the space-time continuum and take the friends beyond the ordinary. </p><br><p>  "Why am I worried a little? Alex said, is it really worth us doing this?" </p><br><p>  Nick said: "Of course, let's activate rather, space is already tired of this time, there is no strength to pretend that it is, but the strength to stop pretending and not to find at all." </p><br><p>  Ulla said: "But let's agree for the fence not to go and sit only here, and then look for you where it is not clear, there will be no space. Nick said as the most experienced, and you can‚Äôt go back to the roof! Let's not go there!" </p><br><p>  "OK! - said friends, got their runes, peered and read - We all live in a Yellow Submarine." </p><br><p>  Pieces of paper with runes died away and friends gazed at each other, - "Well, what do you feel something?"  - they asked each other.  However, so far no one felt anything, they decided that the destruction of space was not a simple and quick matter and sat in the chairs on the veranda. </p><br><h2 id="aleks">  Alex </h2><br><p>  Alex stared into reality and tried to catch the moment of its destruction.  Already a long time ago, he logically knew that there is no reality and all that we see is only the result of our social programming and karmic concentration of causes and effects. </p><br><p>  However, this knowledge did not help to be convinced of this in practice.  After cutting his finger, he could not stop feeling pain or just in a dream just switch attention and make the wound disappear.  Therefore, this knowledge and therefore could not be called, so logical conviction and agreement with the opinion of the authors of some books. </p><br><p>  Alex for a long time tried to practice lucid dreaming and meditation and practiced them until now.  But alas, all insights and experiences were not very convincing and could not bring Knowledge into his reading and conviction. </p><br><p>  Therefore, he gazed into reality, waiting for her to show her fragility and mobility inherent in dreams. </p><br><p>  Half an hour passed, but nothing happened.  There were some fluctuations of reality and vision, but they did not differ from the usual effects arising from close contemplation of objects or meditation. </p><br><p>  Alex thought strangely, probably the rune was weak and could not loosen the brackets of our overall consistency. </p><br><p>  ‚ÄúHow are you?‚Äù He asked friends. </p><br><p>  Forty minutes had passed, but the reality was in its place. </p><br><p>  Friends drank tea and decided that it was okay - the attempt was not bad.  And it was already customary to chat about anything, simply securing the same world that they hoped could destroy the runes.  However, at this very moment Alex noticed that the balustrade of the balcony on which they were sitting began to bend a little and, as it were, to become not so strong. </p><br><p>  "It begins," he thought happily, noticing that Nick and Ulla had also become silent.  Apparently they also noticed that the runes began to act. </p><br><p>  Meanwhile, the evening came, in this part of this world it was getting dark early and the local moon, which was considered a magical luminary, quickly rose. </p><br><p>  And suddenly, space flashed, and the whole world outside their home and land instantly and magically turned into open space.  The friends simultaneously understood, everything, the runes worked and there was no way back, the usual space of time still remained within their plot with the house, and behind the fence begins the unknown, unlimited probabilities of realities. </p><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/6a9/b3e/212/6a9b3e21265556bef5f8e946cd9ab943.gif"><br><p>  Image source <a href="https://geektimes.ru/post/151095/">https://geektimes.ru/post/151095/</a> </p><br><p> In this case, everything looked the same as before.  The only difference was that confidence in the continuity and stability of space and time was gone and everything became possible. </p><br><p>  Alex said admiringly: ‚ÄúThe Lifext spacecraft is sailing along the rabbit hole of infinite depth,‚Äù and then, due to the missing logic of the destroyed space, the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãa villa and a garden with small bushes disappeared and a spacecraft appeared soaring majestic in not frozen nothing. </p><br><h2 id="mir-drakonov">  Dragon world </h2><br><p>  Friends involuntarily straightened up and began to closely observe the subtle nuances of peace and space.  All solid objects became indefinite and plastic, they appeared unsteady and translucent.  A stone house with a balustrade and stone pillars and a fence became a spaceship that simply existed in the cosmos of reality.  The sky was painted with bright colors and the stars of very glamorous color were lit on it.  It was even inconvenient to look at how they winked and shone. </p><br><p>  Nick said: "Let's move the wheelhouse into the courtyard, there is more review and the flight will be more fun." </p><br><p>  Friends took the chair and moved them to the courtyard and put it right in the center of a small trodden area near the house.  The soil was stony and red and in the moonlight resembled the cosmic landscapes of Martian expeditions. </p><br><p>  Alex noticed that the gaze became distracted, but very focused and noticing the nuances of the environment that had previously been impossible to observe simply because too much distracted the mind.  The mind generated too many images and models of reality.  Now, in a strange way, the mind became unidirectional and only one current of reality lingered in it, which gave the magic to any object that was gazed at random. </p><br><p>  ‚ÄúThis is it,‚Äù Alex thought happily, ‚Äúthis is the first confirmation at the very beginning of our journey. And our ship and space behind are formed simply by my focus on it. Probably the rune does not destroy reality, because there is no reality at all - it just makes our mind more unidirectional and at the same time all unnecessary descriptions are themselves crowded out of the picture of dream-sleep and we begin to see its unstable and dreamlike magic structure. " </p><br><p>  Meanwhile, Ulla and Nick sat back in their chairs and looked at the clouds in the sky.  Alex was distracted from the contemplation of the earth, also leaned back and began to look up.  He instantly caught his breath from the opened picture.  Everything breathed and changed.  The habitually black southern sky with bright stars was colored with rainbows, multi-colored diamonds, beautiful clouds.  At the same time, all this breathed, moved and gave a feeling of good and protecting infinity. </p><br><p>  "AAAA - Alex said loudly - wow!" </p><br><p>  Nick also happily said: "See the Dragons, the clouds are the Dragons see?" </p><br><p>  Ulla and Alex began to look intently at the ordinary clouds in the night sky, clearly visible in the moonlight. </p><br><p>  And suddenly, the clouds became different forms of dragons, which slowly, infinitely changing and acquiring different forms sailed across the sky.  No matter what the cloud was - round, elongated, torn or made up of feathers - they all had the essence of the ancient, endlessly living dragons who sailed on different realities watching different worlds. </p><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/6g/qv/rc/6gqvrcpcaur6_d-qfm4dk-qnknm.jpeg"><br><p>  <a href="">Image source</a> </p><br><p>  The opened picture was so large-scale and indescribable for realization that for about five minutes friends just sat and watched the forms of dragons infinitely slowly and in endless forms live-manifest-float in the night sky. </p><br><p>  It should be noted that Nick was an artist and in most of his paintings there were strange looking whelps who could just be present in the background or somehow interact with the plot of the picture. </p><br><p>  "The clouds themselves have not changed and remained the same as they were before, but since space and time were destroyed, we could come to visit Nick, Alex thought with shock, because space usually separates us and we, as planets, hang in there, we see each other‚Äôs self-conceived images, but we never intersect and cannot see real people. " </p><br><p>  "Although we cannot see our true selves either. Although there are no real ones at all. Oh well ...", Alex got tired. </p><br><p>  ‚ÄúAnd if space is time destroyed ... Ohhhh,‚Äù he thought again, ‚Äúit‚Äôs not the space that was destroyed, but our fixation on the flow of our thoughts. That is, it‚Äôs not the space that separates us, but an endless stream of internal manifestations - thoughts, images, feelings, fixations. they are the hard space in which we sail and live our lives. " </p><br><p>  "And yes, now there is no space and we just built the world of dragons in the sky as a guest of Nick's mind. That is, for the first time I see Nick's real friend, and not my idea of ‚Äã‚Äãit." </p><br><p>  He gazed admiringly at dragons that were stately, sometimes playful, invariably, and changing, sailing across the sky just existing.  They did not have a goal and there was no point, they were just always and became visible when the familiar world was destroyed. </p><br><p>  "Probably this is one of the guards of reality, even more likely it is the guards from which the sky of our reality is created," thought Alex. </p><br><p>  So looking at and admiring the dragons, Alex sat beside his friends, and the Lifext ship continued its journey through ruined reality and time. </p><br><h2 id="prosto-heppi">  Just happy </h2><br><p>  Ulla was sitting and worried, her thoughts were returning to the moment when reality collapsed and there were problems in her that could catch up with them on the Lifext ship.  She got up from her chair and began to walk there and say to Nick: ‚ÄúBut what if They come and start, and we sit here without space and time, do nothing, and do nothing ...‚Äù </p><br><p>  Nick, smiling, slowly and calmly said: "Honey, right now we have happy and it is not only right now, but it just is, was and will be and will not go anywhere. Yes, he continued enthusiastically - we can always be happy and the only error in complications. " </p><br><p>  "You just have to be happy nothing more and then everything is simple and clear." </p><br><p>  ‚ÄúYes, yes, dad,‚Äù Ulla said quickly, ‚Äúthis is understandable, but if they come and find and spoil? Then what?‚Äù </p><br><p>  "You can't spoil anything, just happy it is out of order to spoil or appear, just be happy," Nick replied with a smile from the Indian swami. </p><br><p>  Friends looked skeptical at him.  "It is clear that Nika is just happy to eat easily - Alex thought - he doesn‚Äôt think about anything and has no worries, draws his pictures to himself ... .." - and then, suddenly, thanks to the ruined space, he saw the abyss of his ideas about how and what should to be and, at the same time, I saw just happy, which is always just there - "WOW - he said starting just like Nick, a little weird smile, - just happy just like dragons, it is and it is we, as well as everything else too we." </p><br><p>  And it was covered by causeless happiness, which should not be based on anything.  The wave of happiness has grown, fell and still remained unchanged at its core. </p><br><p>  "Just happy!"  - smiling and bouncing excitedly, he said to Ulla. </p><br><p>  Nick also happily looked at Ulla, who had not yet entered the space just happy nurturing the remnants of their constructions.  She asked: "But this will end? The space will be built again, time will begin its nasty ticking and we will again live and eat, and then why, why?" </p><br><p>  "Just happy will not go anywhere and will remain forever - Nick answered, - the main thing is not to be afraid, let him in and let it be." </p><br><p>  ‚ÄúWhere the space will be rebuilt‚Äù ... this is just a thought that is thought now and occupies with itself a place that can just be happy.  Let's go!" </p><br><p>  And Ulla believed and swam. </p><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/873/7cc/078/8737cc0781f14c77a79df4e3941c0cd7.JPG" alt="image"><br><p>  Image source <a href="https://geektimes.ru/post/252866/">https://geektimes.ru/post/252866/</a> </p><br><p>  Inexpressible happiness enveloped friends.  They understood that space in itself does not give anything and does not take it. </p><br><p>  After several spatial loops, Alex, sitting at the laptop, typed these lines and continued to repeat in his mind: </p><br><p>  Time does not come and does not go away <br>  and let the new year 2018 arrive <br>  and the way is just happy in it self-manifest for all all all <br>  and never go anywhere </p></div>
