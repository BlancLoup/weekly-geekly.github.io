Aidar Akhmetzyanov learned about an internship in Europe from a university newsletter, went through an online interview and went to France for a month.

      In a team of four, a student was involved in the creation and launch of a mobile application for finding nannies.  ‚ÄúThe service is designed for parents who need to find a reliable, proven nanny in a matter of hours - the right person will arrive in 60 minutes,‚Äù says Aydar Akhmetzyanov, a student at Innopolis University. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/001/b5f/edd/001b5feddbbe576d374a04aa3d8e806e.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  The operation of the application is similar to the service for ordering a taxi: a nanny who has a certificate of completion of the relevant training can register with the application.  Parents enter the program and create an application to which free nannies respond. <br><br>  ‚ÄúIn the fall, we are launching a project in Ireland.  In this country, education and certification of nannies is regulated at the state level, therefore there is a guarantee that a reliable person will look after the child, ‚ÄùAydar comments. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/72a/2c1/130/72a2c113085095710138fc28ed8eeaf9.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  In the choice of a reliable assistant family reviews helped by other users.  In the service you can find someone who simply takes and takes the children out of school, or even a family friend who will take care of the children for several years in a row.  The application is already available in the App Store and Google Play. <br><br>  Now the team is waiting for a response on the financing of the project for 15 thousand euros from the Irish organization supporting small and medium-sized businesses.  The student noted that in the future, if there is an investor, the team will launch an application in Russia.  For our country, developers will add the ability to order and carer for the elderly or sick people. <br><br>  Igor Shulgan also trained at the European Innovation Academy.  At the online interview, Igor's motivation, IT skills and level of English were tested. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/839/5af/376/8395af376d753cd5a07481256b21b63c.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  24 days a student in a team of five people worked on an application for ordering dinner in a restaurant.  ‚ÄúPeople do not have enough time for a normal lunch, as it lasts about an hour, so most often the choice falls on fast food.  We have created a service with which you can get a full-fledged lunch instantly, ‚Äùsays Igor. <br><br>  Going into the application, the user sees which dishes and in what quantity are available at one time or another in different restaurants.  He chooses a place, orders dishes for a specific time, comes to the appointed hour, where a hot dinner is already waiting on the table.  This saves at least 30 minutes, which is spent on studying the menu and waiting for the order. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/672/517/455/6725174551d76680533278184afb9673.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  ‚ÄúSimilar applications work in America, but they are few.  Our service is different in that restaurants specify in advance the number of dishes that they can serve, which makes the cooking process faster, ‚Äùexplains Igor Shulgan. <br><br>  The application has not yet been launched, but at the end of the internship program, it has already been tested and approved by investors and academy mentors.  During the month, students plan to launch an application in France, as there is support from a mentor who helps the team get into the program of a French startup accelerator.  Programmers expect to receive funding through investment from the accelerator. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/d6b/8bd/179/d6b8bd179abddf9dcb2404a33d4c3ec6.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  ‚ÄúForeign internship is different from Russian practice in that we are taught to program, and there to create a startup.  I would advise everyone who plans to open their own company to go through this academy.  This is the experience of international communication with people of different professions, with people who have created both successful and failed startups.  These 3 weeks will help to avoid the thousands of mistakes and problems that are allowed when starting a project, and to find future teammates and investors, ‚Äùadds Igor Shulgan. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/9f0/3c3/445/9f03c3445a87b4d36aee188eb751f6bf.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Elnira Shimchik, Director of International and Academic Cooperation of Innopolis University, noted that the participation of IT university students in the Summer School of the European Innovation Academy and the development of interesting projects by them is another illustration of the fact that the university provides relevant knowledge: ‚ÄúThe European Innovation Academy collaborates Silicon Valley: California Institute of Berkeley, Stanford University, Google, IBM, CA, and others, and the Academy‚Äôs programs are being developed and implemented  with their participation.  The next Summer School of the Academy will be held in Italy in July 2017, and we hope that students from Innopolis University will be able to distinguish themselves there. ‚Äù </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/311576/">https://habr.com/ru/post/311576/</a></p>
