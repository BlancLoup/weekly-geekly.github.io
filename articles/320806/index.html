This article describes the concept of the proposal, typical configurations and how they are used in the corporate IT infrastructure. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/af1/41a/3f4/af141a3f42894901a37cc412a6488b11.jpg"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  <b>The concept of "The Cloud Machine"</b> <br><br>  According to this concept, Oracle moves hardware to a customer data center, with pricing policies similar to its offer in an Oracle public cloud.

      <br>
      Such a proposal can be regarded as a bold step, aimed at expanding the presence of Oracle hardware in the customer's local data centers, with payment for software and services corresponding to earlier offers. <br><br>  Today three machines of this family are available - with 288, 576 and 1080 processor cores.  All machines use Intel Broadwell processors with X5 architecture.  In the second half of 2016, these offers became available on the European market. <br><br>  However, a potential customer should understand that this is not a classic prepaid service, starting with a few dozen or hundreds of dollars - the payment for one computing core is $ 75 per month. <br><br>  The requirement of Oracle is the client's obligation for at least three years, with a basic starting payment of $ 21.6 thousand. At the same time, the customer receives IaaS components (hardware, storage devices and the network).  If a customer wants to receive additional PaaS services, such as Java Cloud Services or a database, an additional fee will be required. <br><br>  The advantage that customers get is a managed and externally supported hardware system behind the enterprise firewall.  One of the components of this advantage is seamless integration between cloud and on-premise services, i.e., customers can, if they wish, develop a solution in the cloud, deploying it on-site, and vice versa. <br><br>  It is also interesting that Oracle offers systems on Intel processors, and not on its own processors based on the SPARC architecture.  However, the company has left a choice to potential customers and can also offer a SPARC-based Oracle Cloud Machine in an Oracle public cloud. <br><br>  Thus, the new Oracle Cloud Machine can be viewed as a solution aimed at a specialized market for companies that have reason to avoid the openness of a public cloud with an adequate IT budget, as well as striving for Oracle as a supplier company. <br><br>  <b>Typical configurations and use of OCM</b> <br><br>  The Oracle Public Cloud Machine (OPCM) is an IaaS (Infrastructure-as-a-Service) solution that is owned and operated by Oracle.  This IaaS service is designed to provide flexible computing in the customer‚Äôs data center, running on its own site and protected by its firewall. <br><br>  Oracle physically supplies its OPCM hardware and local or remote Gateway server to a customer-defined information center. <br>  Next, Oracle installs and configures the Gateway server, OPCM, software and makes it available as a service. <br><br>  The service can be implemented in three configurations - Model 288, Model and Model 1080, with an optional upgrade from Model 288 to Model 576, and from Model 576 to Model 1080. <br><br>  The model number corresponds to the OCPU (Oracle Cloud Processor Unit) quantity used.  All models also contain the OCPU B860xx supervisor. <br><br>  The computational power of each OCPU is equivalent to one physical core of an Intel Xeon processor with hyper-threading technology.  Each OCPU corresponds to two instruction execution threads. <br><br>  <b>Service activation, its use and payment</b> <br><br>  - The customer starts using the OPCM service after Oracle installs and configures a specific OPCM configuration and provides it with user names and passwords. <br><br>  - The OPCM service includes installation, configuration, patching, upgrading, monitoring and administering the cloud as described in the document ‚ÄúCloud Hosting and Delivery Policies‚Äù. <br><br>  - The service period for OPCM is thirty six months, starting from the day the customer receives user logins and passwords (unless otherwise specified in the order). <br><br>  60 days after the end of the service period, and in the absence of a new OPCM service order relating to the same OPCM hardware, Oracle will erase all data from the disks, flash cards and storage containers on the OPCM.  Oracle also dismounts OPMC hardware and gateways from a customer‚Äôs datacenter. <br><br>  <b>Oracle Public Cloud Machine ZS3</b> <br><br>  The Oracle Public Cloud Machine ZS3 is designed to provide the necessary data storage at the customer‚Äôs site as a service, inside an information space protected by its firewall.  The offer is available in two configurations - Model 268 and Model 536. <br><br>  For a monthly fee, the customer can use the entire storage system (excluding redundancy, write cache and control data) in the selected OPCM ZS3 configuration. <br><br>  The Oracle Public Cloud Machine ZS3 Model 268 includes a 268 TV storage system (including data redundancy, cache recording and control data).  120 TB are available to the user. <br><br>  The Oracle Public Cloud Machine ZS3 Storage Expansion Model 536 includes a similar storage system with a capacity of 536 TVs.  The user has 240 TV. <br><br>  <b>Features and benefits</b> <br><br>  <b><i>1. Development on PaaS and IaaS architectures with appropriate API and integration</i> .</b> <br><br>  - Flexibility, simplicity and automation of customer data center through the use of Oracle Cloud on-premises. <br><br>  - Applications are written only once and deployed to the Oracle Cloud or Oracle Cloud Machine. <br><br>  - Provides workload balancing with identical PaaS and IaaS software between Oracle Cloud and Oracle Cloud Machine. <br><br>  <b><i>2. Development, deployment and management of workloads (both Oracle and non-Oracle in the customer data center.</i></b> <br><br>  - High elasticity of the public cloud - the same software is used for both the Oracle cloud and the on-premise component. <br><br>  - The benefits of the proposed Oracle approach for the customer are provided by the usual, cost-effective for the customer, subscription pricing and operational model, as in the Oracle Cloud. <br><br>  - The solution has the functionality and user environment, as in the Oracle Cloud. <br><br>  ‚ÄúThe customer can be confident in the delivery of a turnkey solution, with a fully externally managed service, including hardware, software, and services. <br><br>  <b><i>3. The ability to run cloud and any existing Oracle and non-Oracle loads in the data center of the client.</i></b> <br><br>  - Ability to create cloud applications with Oracle platform services running on the Oracle Cloud Machine. <br><br>  - Providing high speed public cloud operation on the Oracle Cloud Machine. <br><br>  - Modernization and expansion of critical business applications for the Oracle Cloud, as well as providing advanced features of PaaS and IaaS. <br><br>  <b><i>4. Compliance with regulatory legislation and the requirements of access rights to information when the customer‚Äôs cloud is operating at the customer‚Äôs site.</i></b> <br><br>  - Use industry best practices in technology and security. <br><br>  - Running applications in a client's own data center with the appropriate security structures. <br><br>  - Compliance with regulatory instructions in the field of data storage and management. <br><br>  <b><i>5. Development of a client‚Äôs own cloud based on technologies built for growth.</i></b> <br><br>  - Built on open standards, including Linux and the Xen hypervisor. <br><br>  - Compliance for interoperability, audit and safety requirements for open and industry standards. <br><br>  <b>Practice using OCM</b> <br><br>  In the past few years there has been a sharp increase in the amount of information processed by the information systems of enterprises and organizations.  This is due to the ‚Äúdata explosion‚Äù and the corresponding growth of cloud services for data manipulation.  Gartner estimated the global cloud services market at $ 204 billion in 2016. <br><br>  However, many corporate computing workloads are still processed in on-premises data centers located at the customer‚Äôs site and protected from external influences by the firewall.  Analyst estimates vary quite a bit, but some of them claim that on-premise corporate data processing reaches a volume of up to 75% worldwide. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/87b/3c9/ba6/87b3c9ba644c4c21b1ad75941951c9c4.png"><br>  <i>Three quarters of corporate workloads still fall on enterprise internal data centers.</i>  <i>According to analysts, this "pulls such enterprises to the bottom of the industry."</i> <br><br>  IDC in the report "A View of the Cloud Market: Segmenting Cloud Buyers" noted that 18% of companies still use cloud services for only 1-2 relatively small corporate loads, and 20% of respondents are still at the planning stage of their deployment. <br><br>  In addition to the problems and difficulties of migrating long-running and deeply deployed workloads in on-premise systems, many companies have security problems with their critical business applications and data in the public cloud. <br><br>  In her blog ‚ÄúOracle Cloud Machine: Oracle Cloud At Your Datacenter‚Äù on the official Oracle website, its Principal Product Marketing Director Edgar Haren notes that it was these circumstances that prompted the company to build a concept and then create the Oracle Cloud hardware and software. Machine. <br><br>  Heren defines it as ‚Äúa new and destructive old-fashioned solution for clients who want flexible and efficient cloud services, but with a high level of security and management of these services from their own data center.‚Äù <br><br>  In the corporate IT market, there are quite a few segments of enterprises and organizations that require different approaches to computing.  Each such segment today includes a large number of enterprises that are not able to take advantage of the public cloud due to business and regulatory requirements. <br><br>  As a result, they turn to rapidly aging technologies, which imply the installation of all (or almost all) computing power on their own, well protected from external influences, sites.  More often than others, such clients work in health care, finance, and government organizations. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/df1/759/aa9/df1759aa98eb496fab268b63a9eeac6f.png"><br>  <i>Three variants of the Oracle Cloud Machine offered by the company.</i> <br><br>  The Oracle Cloud Machine provides PaaS and IaaS capabilities behind the corporate firewall.  This allows you to choose how to manage workloads and their level of mobility, balancing them between the public cloud and on-premise computing power. <br><br>  As a result, the business benefits from cloud innovation in their own data center, and developers - the ability to quickly build, test and deploy applications.  Since OCM payment is made according to the subscription model, this ensures the responsibility of the sole supplier to the client, both in the public cloud and on-premise. <br><br>  Summarizing, you can summarize some of the key benefits of using OCM for a corporate client. <br><br>  1. Oracle Cloud runs as a service behind the corporate firewall. <br><br>  2. It uses the same PaaS and IaaS software and the same updates as Oracle Cloud. <br><br>  3. The same cost-effective subscription pricing model is used as for the Oracle Cloud. <br><br>  4. The entire hardware and software complex complies with regulatory legislation, legal, business and privacy requirements. <br><br>  5. The client retains control over their critical business systems.  It can use its own firewalls, load balancers, VPN hardware, etc. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/f35/026/223/f350262232a143b6bf5264770a95195f.png"><br>  <i>Typical initial configuration of Oracle Cloud Machine.</i> <br><br>  Enterprises in the course of their activities face many problems - the inability to use cloud structures and services in the existing configuration of corporate IT infrastructure, inconsistency with regulatory legislation, excessive expansion of the database, unacceptably long waiting times, insufficient performance, etc. <br><br>  Many clients studied the possible consequences of migration to the cloud and often found insufficient compatibility between their on-premise platform and the cloud platform they considered.  Oracle Cloud Machine solves these problems. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/734/1e1/e15/7341e1e15b444cbda83c24585d7803e1.png"><br>  <i>Typical customer problems and solutions using the Oracle Cloud Machine.</i> <br><br>  Whether the customer is going to start using a hybrid cloud model, or if he already has part of the workloads running outside his own platform, Oracle Cloud Machine offers a unique solution that guarantees on-premise compatibility and cloud-based database, software, and application deployments. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/320806/">https://habr.com/ru/post/320806/</a></p>
