Inspired by one of the latest materials <a href="https://habr.com/ru/company/kaspersky/blog/445858/">on the</a> "telephone construction", we decided to offer a similar post, but about a smart watch. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/is/q5/t7/isq5t7pe3y64zecfghgctefrl9s.jpeg"><br><br>  Which become weird before our eyes. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Smart watches are a category where they do not wander from the point of view of design: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/212483/">having begun their history</a> back in the 70s, they did not undergo radical changes in visual terms.  Most often it is either a circle or a square.

      In the usual hours - much more opportunities for experiments. <br><br>  For example, <b>Hublot MP05 LaFerrari</b> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/7c/qi/fw/7cqifw5xv6w4ubkhgxvop6mae64.jpeg"><br><br>  The form itself is not just atypical for watches, but in general does not hint at watches in principle.  Yes, corny, to consider the time, you will not immediately guess where to look.  Cost on Chrono from 19 million rubles. <br><br>  Or, for example, <b>Thunderbolt MB &amp; F HM4</b> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/dy/6e/ko/dy6ekoyxtpiwjbkpccgmtnx2g-0.jpeg"><br><br>  The dial of this model also has nothing to do with a classic watch.  The cost of the order of 10 million rubles.  At one of the sites saw a 10% discount ... We must take! <br><br>  Smart watches in form should still resemble a watch - because the display they have is not just for time, but for working with notifications and other smartphone functions.  They can almost be surprised by nothing, so the main focus on functionality, sensor accuracy, problem solving, for example, like <a href="https://habr.com/ru/company/medgadgets/blog/418603/">Matrix, has closed charging problems</a> . <br><br>  But all this is <b>almost 100%</b> in the form of a square or a circle. <br><br>  <b>"Multidisplay"</b> <br><br>  One way to be original is to mix displays.  It may remain round in shape, but in the category it will be something like ‚Äú2 in 1‚Äù.  There were not many of them: last year we wrote <a href="https://habr.com/ru/company/medgadgets/blog/411591/">about MyKronoz</a> - a hybrid clock with digital and analog displays. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/ya/-j/jx/ya-jjx-hd_myihddoxjky614slq.jpeg"><br><br>  The concept of a similar device was presented in the <a href="https://bxclvr.com/span-smart-watch">Span</a> designer watch.  True, the exact opposite: a strip of digital display here was placed on top of the analog dial. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/ij/s3/ct/ijs3cte4-_uac8oouusxw-ki8g0.jpeg"><br><br>  How to guess when it will be fifteen three is not clear.  But in principle, the arrows at other times will remain visible.  On the display, you can receive notifications about calls, SMS, etc. And still - in the form of a circle ... <br><br>  <b>Follow smartphones</b> .  "Multidisplay 2.0" <br><br>  Strictly speaking, a smart watch is a small smartphone on the wrist, so it is logical that nothing ‚Äúsmartphone‚Äù is alien to them.  When the topic with two screens in smartphones was just beginning to be actively discussed, the first projects of smart watches with similar properties began to appear. <br><br>  <b>Doppio watch</b> <br><br>  One of the most quoted fantasies on this topic.  <a href="https://phys.org/news/2016-05-doppio-unveil-dual-screen-smartwatch.html">A clamshell</a> watch, or a watch with two screens, which were revealed on the principle of a book, has not yet been released. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/rz/k9/1a/rzk91ahxltmmwwd3sbsufrljhxe.jpeg"><br><br>  One can only imagine how uncomfortable it is in real life ... <br><br>  <b>Flexible displays</b> <br><br>  Drawings and sketches, projects of watch designs, the bracelet of which was itself and the display simultaneously across the entire plane, have been walking around the network for a very, very long time.  Although they are again in demand only now, after two well-known presentations from two well-known brands. <br><br>  For example, 2013, <b>EmoPulse</b> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/ns/iz/l-/nsizl-3wqbk1gnqpivsegfklfei.jpeg"><br><br>  The campaign on IndieGogo, of course, was suddenly interrupted, and the site, of course, has not been opened for a long time.  But - who remembers the old, to that ... So we suggest to look at the most recent - <b>Nubia Alpha</b> . <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/jq/jv/xr/jqjvxrovcr8voawb8m6x3qrybqo.gif"><br><br>  It has all the features of a modern smart watch, built-in heart rate monitor, camera.  At the same time, if we mean by the form of the clock - the form of the display, then this model really stands out from the rest: the display here is ‚Äúfinished‚Äù and flexible. <br><br>  And yet, again and again, all these are classic regular forms.  Because a flexible display could theoretically be like this: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/fv/ml/c1/fvmlc1lswswlxvwwn8k5d5chalc.jpeg"><br><br>  But no.  In general - when does a smart watch get weird?  - Right now!  But still within a strictly defined framework. <br><br>  <b>Thongs - the first flexible displays</b> <br><br>  If <a href="https://habr.com/ru/company/medgadgets/blog/368795/">smart straps</a> were launched and sold at least some impressive volume, then, of course, you could roam with the designs of dials. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/q-/ua/ei/q-uaei7cyzqw7djopoldlfhekea.png"><br><br>  In this case, formally, we would have had a ‚Äúsmart watch with a flexible display‚Äù for several years.  But no.  Although the same Samsung, which recently showed Fold, two years earlier <a href="https://www.sammobile.com/2017/05/25/samsung-patents-a-smartwatch-with-a-built-in-camera/">patented</a> and flexible strap. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/n0/ya/no/n0yanoyvr2fef4hc03bigwwlr2k.jpeg"><br><br>  Could and let out.  Nothing complicated, right? <br><br>  <b>New data mapping</b> <br><br>  One of the curious projects of smartwatch ever announced was always Dot Watch.  They did not change the form, did not change the content, but changed the display format - this is a smart braille watch for the blind and visually impaired. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/mx/zd/9e/mxzd9etpxpajql5yzbwy3mppqxs.png"><br><br>  The display here is absolutely not similar to our usual displays.  But this product is not massive. <br><br>  In general, it turns out that if smartphones could even be produced at once in strange forms, then with a smart watch it no longer rolls: the maximum that you can count on (if someone needs it) on flexible displays in the near future and on a smart watch in the form of a book - in the distant future. <br><br>  Great weekend to everyone! </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/445924/">https://habr.com/ru/post/445924/</a></p>
