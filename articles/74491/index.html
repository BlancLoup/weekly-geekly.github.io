  <section class="page js-page"><h1>How does a single-processor tower server differ from a desktop?</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  A small company that decides to buy its first server often finds that the models of single-processor tower servers offered for SMBs (for example, HP ProLiant ML 110, ML115 and ML310) differ little from a normal desktop not only in size, but also in parameters CPU clock speed, RAM, and hard disk capacity.  However, if you more closely analyze the configuration of the server, you will find serious differences. <br><br><img src="http://www.communities.hp.com/online/cfs-file.ashx/__key/CommunityServer.Blogs.Components.WeblogFiles/hport/_210435044004320435044004_-HP-ProLiant-DL150.jpg" alt="HP ProLiant DL150 Server"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  <b>Let's start with the processor</b> .  Younger tower servers use a Xeon or Opteron processor, although Pentium or Celeron are also supported as an option.  Xeon and Opteron have a higher amount of embedded cache than processors designed for desktop PCs (if the Intel processors for desktops do not exceed 3 MB, then the younger Xeon models are equipped with a cache from 6 to 12 MB), which means higher performance with run most applications.  As a result, a uniprocessor server processes user requests faster than a desktop, and this directly translates into improved productivity for small office workers.  In addition, Xeon and Opteron are specifically designed for servers, so they are designed for more severe operating conditions than processors on desktop PCs, and are able to work continuously for several days. <br><br>  The second difference is a <b>powerful disk subsystem</b> that supports both standard desktop SATA 7200 hard drives / min and more high-speed hard drives with SAS (Serial Attached SCSI) 10 or 15 thousand rev / min.  The use of SAS disks significantly improves the speed of reading / writing applications with intensive access to the storage system, for example, a database.  In addition, SAS hard drives have higher reliability than SATA drives and are able to handle read / write requests around the clock.  As a rule, even younger models of tower servers are equipped with a hardware RAID controller to combine internal server disks into a RAID array, which improves the overall speed of the disk subsystem and protects data in case of a server disk failure.

      <br>
      Finally, many models of tower servers support hot swapping of a failed disk without shutting down the machine (this function is practically not used in desktops, which are usually used with only one hard drive), which minimizes damage from a hard drive failure.  Also, to protect against data corruption due to errors in the RAM in the servers, memory modules with DDR ECC parity control are used. <br><br>  Another important difference between the entry-level server and the desktop is the enhanced <b>remote management capabilities</b> .  For example, the HP ProLiant ML 110 and 115 installs a special HP ProLiant Lights-Out 100c Remote Management Card, which allows you to remotely monitor the status of the server and perform its diagnostics (the more advanced HP ProLiant ML 310 model has an iLO2 controller that implements a powerful functionality of remote management and maintenance of multiprocessor HP ProLiant).  Since the main buyers of these HP ProLiant models are small companies that often do not have a system administrator, using this controller, HP technical support can diagnose failures, and the server owner does not have to spend money to call a specialist from the service center or take the server there . <br><br>  We should not forget that, unlike desktops, which their manufacturers do not intend to use as a server, all HP ProLiant ML models are certified for <b>compatibility with Microsoft Windows server editions</b> and come with wizards for quick server deployment in the network, which guarantees the absence of computer compatibility issues with the server operating system and network environment. <br><br>  The HP ProLiant ML case design itself is designed to simplify changes to the configuration of their internal components, and if the company develops its local network and wants to assemble all of its computer hardware in a 19-inch rack, then these <b>servers can be easily transformed from tower in rack</b> . <br><br>  Thus, the ProLiant ML entry-level tower servers outperform conventional desktops not only in terms of performance, but also in terms of quick commissioning and prevention of failures, so their use as the core of the local network ensures efficient and reliable operation of the IT infrastructure of a small office. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/74491/">https://habr.com/ru/post/74491/</a></p>
