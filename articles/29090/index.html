  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Sales consultants are now available in online stores.</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Online stores have always been popular, and recently they are gaining momentum more and more.  This is not surprising, because there is usually more choice, much cheaper than the same M-Video or Eldorado supermarkets, and there is no need to go anywhere.  But there is one drawback: sometimes you do not know which product to choose due to the lack of certain knowledge, but there is no one to help! <br>  <strong>Marva has</strong> solved this problem for many online stores by developing a product that turns a dry website into a communication center with comprehensive online consulting. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Once in the online store home cinema Pult.ru, you will immediately be attacked by a pop-up "window", like a banner ad.  On the other side of the ‚Äúwindow‚Äù sits a consultant who in the text chat mode offers practical advice, if you are not fully determined with the choice of technology. <br>  The main difference between the Marva product and standard ICQ and telephone services offered on corporate websites is interactivity.  Not only the client, but also the operator of the company can be the first to enter into communication.  To effectively use the system, companies need to have their own consultants.  The solution proposed by Marva allows one employee of the company to communicate with two or three site visitors at once.  In essence, this reminds an encouraging gesture of a seller in a store ready to come to the aid of the buyer: ‚ÄúWhy would you please?‚Äù All this technical treasure is sold to companies for a modest monthly fee of 900 to 240 thousand rubles.  per month.  However, the most popular yet tariffs are 4750 rubles.  per month using the program.  The first customers were small Internet companies that have to fight hard for each visitor.  However, notes Manovich, now major players are interested in the Marva service: Publishing House Afisha, IBS group of companies, St. Petersburg Chamber of Commerce and Industry. <br>  On a universal scale, Marva is not a revolutionary.  Since 1995, American LivePerson has been developing and implementing active monitoring and visitor management systems since 1995.  But in Russia it is a debut.  The company spent ‚Äú300 sleepless nights‚Äù and $ 15 thousand to develop the service. Active sales began only a month ago.  According to Pavel Manovich (owner of the company Marva), he has not yet returned the invested funds.  But if you consider that only in the first month I earned $ 5,000 from ‚Äúconsulting‚Äù and attracted 60 clients, then the return is not far off.  ‚ÄúThe project will pay off by the end of this year,‚Äù says Manovich. <br>  The plans of the company Marva to bring the system to perfection.  Soon, site visitors will be able to communicate not only with consultants, but also among themselves.  At the same time, the company is confident that in the future they will create a product that allows them to advise both through text messages and through audio and video chat. <br><br><hr><br>  Unusual startup.  Good approach.  I think it will be interesting and useful! <br>  <i>Based on an article from the magazine "The Secret of the Firm"</i> <br>  Product link: <a href="http://marva.ru/">www.marva.ru</a> </div>
