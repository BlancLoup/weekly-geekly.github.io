However, a specialized publication that would cover the data center market in detail would tell about the best practices; there are no talented people in this field in Russia yet.  Now will be!  In October of this year, the first issue of the TsODY.RF magazine, the first Russian magazine specializing in the high-tech data center industry, will be published. <br><br>  We feel that in the information flow, the data center sphere is not paid enough attention, there is no publication that would continuously cover data centers not only as a set of engineering systems and server solutions, but also data centers as a whole: would conduct tours of existing facilities, broadcast in The foreign experience of data center construction in Russia, conveyed this information to both consumer companies and data center designers. <br><a name="habracut"></a>  + <br>  In addition, it should be noted the active development of technology in the data center industry.  New recommendations, new types of equipment, new infrastructure construction schemes, etc.  - All this requires analysis, transfer of design experience and the effect of implementation. <br><br>  Also, from a number of companies we have heard the opinions, they say, there are associations and publishing houses abroad, producing their own white papers and magazines, developing recommendations, standards, etc., and in Russia there is nothing like that yet.

      The Russian data center market is becoming more and more open, high competition contributes to this, many having broken wood, learned to build in such a way that it was not painfully embarrassing to show their offspring.  It is not conceivable 4-5 years ago to get into the Russian data center with a camera and openly declare that the photos will be published on the Internet was almost impossible, although in the west such photo-excursions were published with a bang.  The Russian data center market is already warm enough, and today many data center operators are kindly inviting not only potential customers for the excursions, but also the press, and some even hide nothing from meticulous specialists.  In our magazine, we want to give a new life to a photo tour of the data center, to objectively and independently talk about the infrastructure, to appreciate the bold engineering solutions, to communicate with people who build them with their own hands. <br><br>  One of the main issues that had to be solved by the editors of the journal was the need to launch the <b>printed</b> edition.  After all, today there is so much talk about the extinction of the print press, the transition to electronic media and Internet sites.  On the one hand, this is certainly correct. <br><br>  But, on the other hand, is it possible that an electronic device can replace the pleasure of holding a real paper magazine in your hands, with the smell of printing ink, the rustling of leafing pages, the ability to scroll pages with one index finger, and at least five, or even ten ways that will distract you, with a new message in icq, emails and at the most inopportune moment will report that only 1% of energy remains. <br><br>  Fans of travel know how their associates chase various issues of GEO magazine, where they talk about a particular point on the globe.  And they do not just chase - collect them, store files from different years.  And the point is not that in the age of information technology it is impossible to find information about the desired vacation spot or travel - there is everything on the Internet today and even more.  The fact is that GEO is a quality journal, and it is from it that travelers want to draw information. <br><br>  Why not create a binder for a data center log?  The relevance of the journal‚Äôs numbers will not be lost over time: after a year or two, specialists will also be interested in opening the magazine and seeing how and by which architecture a particular object was built;  or how and on what principle this or that equipment works. <br><br>  TsODy.RF magazine is distributed free of charge and anyone who subscribes to the <a href="http://xn--d1atxw.xn--p1ai/">tsyody.rf</a> website will receive it throughout the territory of the Russian Federation and the CIS. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/150307/">https://habr.com/ru/post/150307/</a></p>
