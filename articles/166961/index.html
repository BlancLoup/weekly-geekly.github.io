Future Colleges, WorldSkills and World-Class Manufacturing in Russia</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/dfe/df8/c84/dfedf8c843d380a7bbc54d80ab92e961.jpg" align="right">  All over the world there is a tendency to return production back to their own country.  Finally, it became clear that the predictions that only robots would work in all industries and that people with their skills would become useless to anyone were wrong!  Even the United States recognizes the wrong course of outsourcing industrial production.  As part of the life cycle, it is advantageous to keep production in one's own country in order to retain engineering and technical personnel.  Inhausing is a new challenge for developed countries, because there are practically no qualified technical personnel left.  Apple and Lenovo are already transferring some of their production back to America. <br><br><img align="left" src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/a18/16e/f2f/a1816ef2fabc6bc9c2c3890e85643141.jpg">  So, <b>Tim Cook</b> says: <i>‚ÄúIt's not so much about cost, but about skills ... Over time, manufacturing-related labor skills began to leave the United States.</i>  <i>Not only fewer people, but the education system just stopped producing such personnel.</i>  <i>And it will cost a lot of work to bring it all back. ‚Äù</i> <br><br>  The popular world competition WorldSkills is designed to help popularize the working professions and the spread of uniform standards.  And since the new stage of industrialization has arrived, it is important to work with modern hands not so much as to be able to build automated lines and manage them.  This is the essence of mechatronics, which unites mechanics, electronics, hydraulics, pneumatics and other industrial sciences to create robotic systems.  Finally, this year, Russia, the last of the civilized countries, has become a participant in this global project.  The first <b>WorldSkills</b> contest in the direction of ‚ÄúMechatronics‚Äù was held in Pervouralsk. <a name="habracut"></a>

      The event really amazes with the number of technical innovations and organization.  It seems that either this is all skillful scenery, or you are somewhere in Germany.  And if you yourself were there, then Pervouralsk would remain in your memory as the most progressive single-industry city that you were able to visit. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/a0e/6e6/b70/a0e6e6b708faf054fb2ce8cc75cfa3ad.jpg" align="left">  Let's start with the fact that it is in Pervouralsk that there is a super-modern shop ‚ÄúIron Ozone 32‚Äù, belonging to the holding company ChelPipe (Chelyabinsk Pipe Rolling Plant), the very one in which the light metallurgy industry is becoming reality. <br>  And yes, this is the same factory, the clothing in which is white, and the cost of investment in the construction of the ‚ÄúHeight 239‚Äù workshop was about $ 3 billion. <br><br><h4>  What actually for the competition? </h4><br>  The essence of the competition lies in the fact that each team consisting of several students is given a sealed set of components, among which there are various pressure sensors, movements, stepper motors, electronic components and controllers in order to manage all of these.  According to the rules, students must complete the task assigned to them in the allotted time, that is, assemble a working model from the components, program it and debug it.  This is such an automation of production in miniature.  The winner is the team that collects the working model in the most optimal way and in compliance with the standards. <br><br>  Experts note that this approach to training is completely unique to the Russian system of vocational education and deserves great attention.  It is very likely that Pervouralsk College will become a model for copying in the development of the secondary education system. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/c2b/7be/276/c2b7be2762509ba1cfc941bde6701ac5.jpg" align="left">  The area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe training center is 5000 square meters, the investment in the creation amounted to 800 million rubles.  And now, the preparation of one worker costs the enterprise about one million rubles for three years of study. <br>  The competition for admission has risen from 10 to 16 people to the place since the beginning of the college.  Education is free and the guys are not bound by the contract.  That is, in theory, they can go to work in any other place after graduation.  But judging from the conversation with one of the students, the students are already very impressed by the prospects: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/d35/2b4/2b7/d352b42b709e8b6fcab6a449e9625d75.jpg" align="right">  For example, a short interview with <b>Pavel Denisov</b> , <i>one of the best college students.</i>  <i>All this even sounds strange:</i> <br>  <b>Pavel Denisov: the</b> conditions here are great, it is really nice to study in such an institution. <br>  <b>Alexey Karlov:</b> what are your plans for the future?  Are you guaranteed employment? <br>  <b>PD:</b> Yes, and that's great.  Not every college can boast about it.  The ideal option for me is to work at a pipe plant and move up the career ladder.  In my opinion, every employee dreams about it. <br>  <b>AK:</b> Is it now becoming more prestigious to work in a working specialty? <br>  <b>PD:</b> when you just tell me that you will work in a factory, of course, this does not arouse much enthusiasm among friends.  But if they come here for an open day, for example, then of course they understand that the best working conditions are created here and it is a pleasure to work here.  Here there is a gradual introduction into the life of the plant and this is what allows you to immediately feel at ease and be able to work on any equipment even before the start of official employment. <br><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Andrei Shpitov, Director of the Department of Educational Technologies at FESTO-RF LLC, has interesting comments on how the competition is held abroad:</b> <div class="spoiler_text">  An important part of this competition is career guidance.  When schoolchildren can see with their own eyes and chat with the best guys, specialists in mechatronics. <br>  In London, for example, more than 100,000 schoolchildren were among the visitors at the WorldSkills competition.  At the welding stand, anyone could try their hand at the computer emulation stand.  In the same place, for example, there was a tree where you could write your wish, for example ‚ÄúI want to be a welder‚Äù and attach it.  Plaques with the inscription ‚ÄúWHO AM I?‚Äù Hung everywhere to form an interest in choosing a profession from an early age. <br>  The essence of the dual system of education also lies in the fact that 3.5 years the students are actually supervised by their senior colleagues, and upon graduation, the company receives an already prepared specialist who is ready to start work immediately and familiar with the team. </div></div><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/257/c81/720/257c817203fbfacaaa4d562debbf3cd3.jpg" align="right">  And this is what the classrooms look like: <br><br>  It remains to hope that this practice will be universally introduced in Russia with the participation of large enterprises and the state, improving and strengthening our own in-house production. <br><br><h4>  Some facts: </h4><br>  - A small change in welding standards reduces the number of accidents on the pipeline and leads to a decrease in accidents by 28%, which is billions of rubles. <br><br>  - Russia was the last of the developed countries in the world, in which the WorldSkills system was implemented <br><br>  - There is an agreement between Pervouralsk College and the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation, according to which all graduates enter the service in one military unit near Pervouralsk. <br><br>  - Alcodetectors are located at the entrance to the training center.  You can enter the building only if after the exhalation a green light comes on and the turnstile opens.  In the case of attendance to study or work in a state of intoxication, tough measures are taken up to the expulsion.  They say that one of the members of the delegation at the opening of the competition, while demonstrating the system, still could not get through.  )) <br><br>  - The strange but resounding names ‚ÄúHeight 239‚Äù and ‚ÄúIron Ozone 32‚Äù were invented by the factory‚Äôs employees, engineers. <br><br><h4>  Feel the atmosphere of a robot holiday! </h4><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/IyRmC9R54HI%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=25657,15700023,15700186,15700191,15700253,15700255,15700258&amp;usg=ALkJrhgQLSxWV41ncCcU0a8WfRXogc4QaA" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  What are your thoughts on the education system and the training of technical specialists?
