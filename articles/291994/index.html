This can happen to anyone.  In this case, whether you are a beginner or experienced freelancer, you should not immediately take everything into your account. <br><br>  As part of caring for freelancers, <a href="http://2polyglot.com/%3Futm_source%3D2polyglot%26utm_medium%3DPR%26utm_campaign%3D2">we</a> offer some recommendations on how to keep in touch with a customer.  To many lovers of criticism they may seem trite, yes ... they are commonplace, but they work.  We hope they will help many to protect themselves from unnecessary worries, avoid conflict situations and preserve reputation. <br><br>  <b>Be calm and restrained.</b>  Having received notification from the customer that the work done does not suit him, take a deep breath, exhale ... and do not rush to answer everyone!  He is interested in the result, and not you, perhaps by agreeing, you did not understand each other correctly.  Postpone the answer for 15-20 minutes.  Emotions will recede, and you can figure it out and agree calmly.

And this customer is also not interested, because he believes that "he (the Client) is always right."  If you want to spoil the relationship - start to find out.  Communicate in professional language, demonstrating competence.  Do not lose your temper because of someone's hot temper.  Suggest to the customer also to be discreet and calmly explain what is not suitable.  People are different, but you have only business relations. <br><br>  <b>Find out the reasons for dissatisfaction.</b>  Staying polite and calm, understand what is wrong for your opponent and what he would like to change.  To prevent this situation from occurring, find out in details how the final result will satisfy its high requirements.  In the future, negotiate and decide everything to the smallest detail "on the shore."  And of course, it‚Äôs not worth being angry when a client asks you to redo work. <br><br>  <b>Correct - reputation is more expensive.</b>  Since your understanding of the final result was not achieved immediately, then be prepared to spend a little more time on reworking so as not to lose credibility and reputation.  It makes no sense to look for the extreme, it will not lead to anything.  Show how well you can communicate and find an approach to people.  Working alone, <a href="http://legal_psychology.academic.ru/417/%25D0%259F%25D1%2580%25D0%25BE%25D1%2584%25D0%25B5%25D1%2581%25D1%2581%25D0%25B8%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BB%25D1%258C%25D0%25BD%25D0%25BE-%25D0%25BF%25D1%2581%25D0%25B8%25D1%2585%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BB%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B3%25D0%25B8%25D1%2587%25D0%25B5%25D1%2581%25D0%25BA%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B5_%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B0%25D0%25B2%25D1%258B%25D0%25BA%25D0%25B8_%25D0%25B8_%25D1%2583%25D0%25BC%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B8%25D1%258F">psychological skills</a> are essential.  Having altered, you will only once again demonstrate your high level of professionalism. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/798/31e/383/79831e383e784cfcb07c3b0cbeb19dc8.jpg"><br><br>  <b>Take a lesson from everything.</b>  Any situation is an experience.  Next time prepare all the necessary questions in advance.  The purpose of creating the material, on which it is necessary to focus, etc., try not to miss every detail.  They all have to help you maximize the understanding of what result will satisfy the customer so that you do not have to redo the work done.  Thereby you save your nerves and save time for yourself as well as for the customer. <br><br>  <b>Be careful beforehand.</b>  To learn lessons, it is not necessary to make mistakes.  In the work of a freelancer, as in any other activities have their own risks.  Listen, look closely, notice, try to learn from others, determine for yourself how much the customer can be not reliable and not respectable.  Secure yourself in advance. <br><br>  <b>Do not undertake to perform test tasks.</b>  Yes, almost every freelancer goes through test assignments.  But why do it if, for example, the <a href="http://2polyglot.com/ur/1781">service</a> through which you work verified you and provides the opportunity to place in the profile portfolio and materials from previous works?  This allows anyone who wants to familiarize themselves with these materials and determine for themselves whether your style suits you, the topics in which you work, and more.  If, despite this, you are asked to do something as a test, then you should not agree and waste your time and nerves. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/aea/862/c39/aea862c39a874940b67efdc913f467ea.jpg"><br><br>  <b>Negotiate terms and volumes in advance.</b>  All the features and details of the order, the points related to its implementation, of course, must be discussed and clarified before you begin work.  Perhaps you need to prepare a brief in advance, and first ask the customer to fill it, and then discuss it together, which is the ideal end result.  Speak the scope of work and the timing of their implementation.  Get specific dates, not abstract frames.  This will allow you to plan your time and structure work.  And the customer himself will know when he will get the result. <br><br>  <b>Ask for prepayment.</b>  Nothing bad if this is your prerequisite.  Prepayments can be either full or partial.  Depending on what project, it can be divided into parts ( <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scrum">Scrum</a> ).  At the same time, the traditional payment scheme for each iteration is 50% before and 50% after.  And not getting paid for the sprint - do not proceed to the next.  If the customer is a responsible and decent person who is interested in cooperating with you, then unlike a fraudster he will agree.  Having a good reputation with you is a reason to accept your conditions. <br><br>  <b>Do not show the source.</b>  The customer may ask to see the material in order to agree on working moments, this is normal.  But if, without paying for the order, he asks for the source code, then this is a signal that they are cunning with you and are trying to deceive.  Answer politely that you can send the source code only after payment of the order, according to the agreement. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/ae5/25a/11b/ae525a11bb0748ea985968781b18f49a.jpg"><br><br>  <b>Appreciate yourself.</b>  Despite the fact that you are an experienced freelancer or a beginner, you have every right to agree to work on those conditions under which there will be no deception.  Adhere to the established criteria for themselves by which you agree to cooperate.  Sometimes it is possible to sacrifice principles, but only with proven customers who have proven themselves to be good.  To risk or not, you choose.  Understand everyone - and be successful! </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/291994/">https://habr.com/ru/post/291994/</a></p>
