I think many people know that from February 1, 2017, the cash register should send electronic versions of checks to the operator of fiscal data - the new rules are set in 54- of article 2 of paragraph 2. <br><br>  EKLZ had to be replaced with a fiscal drive, the cash register was connected to the Internet, a contract was concluded with the fiscal data operator and the checks were sent electronically to the FTS through the fiscal data operator. <br><br>  Naturally, parts of the business (not all were affected, many individual entrepreneurs were postponed until July 1, 2019) had to purchase a new cash register equipment, and put the old one in the warehouse or throw it away altogether.

(Depends on model, type of business and functionality) </li><li>  Price FN - from 6500r to 12000r (Terms of FN are different) </li><li>  Contracts with the OFD for 12 Months - ~ 3000r (Prices everywhere are plus or minus the same) </li><li>  Internet for CCT - we all know the prices of wired Internet for individual entrepreneurs and legal entities. </li><li>  It is possible that you can get by with a SIM card with mobile Internet and costs ~ 500-1000 r per year. </li><li>  All these are very average values, but I think the general essence is clear. </li><li>  It is difficult to calculate the costs, it all depends on the specific case.  However, they are. </li></ul><br>  I will give two examples from life for a more real understanding: <br><br>  <i>Example number one:</i> <br><br>  Recently, at the request of very good friends helped them with the installation of KCP. <br>  They are entrepreneurs and they have a small business, they were obliged to install CCV from July 1, 2019. <br>  The costs are as follows: <br>  KKT + FN for 15 Months - 14500r (When you take KKT + FN so much cheaper, they have such a share) <br>  Key EDS (For registration of CCP in tax) - 1 000 rub. <br>  The contract with the OFD for 12 months - 3000r <br>  SIM-card with mobile internet - 500r <br>  Total: 19000r <br><br>  But from January 1, 2018, some entrepreneurs are entitled to a tax deduction for the online cash register. <br><br>  In their case, they are ‚Äúlucky‚Äù.  It remains to issue a tax deduction and from time to time to pay for the OFD, the Internet and the replacement of the FN.  Constant annual costs. <br><br>  <i>Example number two:</i> <br><br>  The company I work for has a park of 20+ CCPs.  We have several legal organizations. <br>  In February 2017, it was necessary to install new CCPs. <br><br>  I don‚Äôt remember the exact numbers, but today the manufacturer‚Äôs website has a ‚ÄúPrice: from 26,000 rubles‚Äù.  Calculate at today's prices. <br><br>  The costs are ‚Äúvery roughly‚Äù the following: <br>  CCV ~ 500000r <br>  FN ~ 120000r <br>  Contract with OFD for 12 Months ~ 60000r <br>  EDS keys ~ 5000r <br>  Total approximately: 685,000 p <br><br>  In example number two, no tax deductions for legal entities are provided. <br>  Take out and put half a million, and this is taking into account the fact that all registrations of CCV were carried out without intermediaries such as TEC, who would also take money for each device.  And we are quite a small company, this is not any tape for you. <br><br>  Summarizing all the above, we can say that in order to comply with the new legislation, the business was forced to spend a tidy sum. <br><br>  And all this without taking into account the fact that many companies with a new law had a huge rework of the IT infrastructure. <br><br>  The business was forced to be serviced at the OFD (Fiscal Data Operator).  There are relatively few of them on the market and they are all accredited by the state, we all understand who they belong to.  Who got there will not be allowed. <br><br>  And business now must pay bribes to commercial companies annually. <br><br>  Just think, 3000 a year for the OFD and 6-8 thousand for an FN for one CCP, and how many such CCPs are in the country, and what a huge amount of money, and, most importantly, money - permanent. <br><br>  And all this is covered up with bravado about business withdrawal from the shadows, but in my opinion they came up with a brilliant legal business scheme, with a huge steady income, lobbied by the state. <br><br>  The most interesting thing in this story is that the business thinks - they bought the ticket office, they installed it, you can sleep well, no matter how. <br><br>  In 2017, our company bought 20+ CCPs from ATOL. <br><br>  ‚Üí <a href="https://www.atol.ru/">ATOL Official Website</a> <br>  ‚Üí <a href="https://habr.com/ru/company/atol/">ATOL on Habr√©</a> <br><br>  I just want to say that I didn‚Äôt want to poke a finger at a specific KKT manufacturer, but I‚Äôll have to continue to understand why. <br><br>  These CCPs have been accredited by the state as CCPs that comply with legal requirements. <br><br>  Our lawmakers did not take long to wait and decided that the current FFD (format of fiscal documents) should be corrected. <br><br>  CCP, I recall, were acquired in February 2017.  <b>And approximately in September 2017, the following changes were made in FFD:</b> <br><br><ul><li>  Changed the numbering of payment types </li><li>  Changed the numbering of VAT rates </li></ul><br>  Just imagine, there is a CCP, the table is used to program the type of payment <br>  Field 1 - Payment Type - Cash <br>  Field 2 - Type of payment - Electronic payments. <br>  They took them, roughly speaking, changed places, or changed the field number, and now your CCP does not meet the requirements of the law, in order to fix it you need to flash all CCP with a new firmware. <br><br>  September 4, 2017, a message appears on the ATOL company forum about the release of a new firmware. <br>  ‚ÄúList of changes v.4555 <br><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Spoiler header</b> <div class="spoiler_text">  <b>- Changed the numbering of payment types in accordance with the requirement of FFD.</b> <b><br></b>  <b>- Changed the numbering of VAT rates in accordance with the requirement of FFD.</b> <br><br>  - Universal firmware under FFD 1.0 and 1.0.5.
