Outwardly, their LVL looks like a regular fitness bracelet, but it has a very wide functionality.  The developers promise to register the level of dehydration, monitor the pulse, activity, mood, sleep and calories burned. <br><br>  All this is packaged in a miniature case, and should work 3-4 days without recharging.  Optical sensors BSX Athletics are used to collect data.  How many promises correspond to reality is not clear.

      But the application is serious.  Therefore, the developers managed to collect 430 thousand dollars instead of the planned 50 - and the collection will last another 37 days. <br><br>  <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/lactate-threshold/lvl-the-first-wearable-hydration-monitor%3Fref%3Dhome_popular">Participate for 99 dollars</a> <br><br><h3>  MOTI Personal Motivator </h3><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/fbf/18a/6d7/fbf18a6d75084e53b20bb8fe253c4d6d.png"><br><br>  A simple LED ‚Äúreminder‚Äù, customizable via smartphone.  Its creators, <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/habitmoti/moti-your-smart-companion-for-better-habits/creator_bio">MOTI, Inc.</a>  decided to approach the issue of motivation from a scientific point of view.  The multicolor lights and the melody chosen by the user, which are tuned for the necessary time, are triggered by a trigger, gradually developing a reflective habit.  At the end of the action, the user must click on the front surface of the <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/habitmoti/moti-your-smart-companion-for-better-habits%3Fref%3Dcategory_recommended">MOTI</a> - the process completion trigger will trigger.  All information is stored in the application and is presented in the form of convenient analytics. <br><br>  Such a seemingly nondescript thing will raise funds for another 29 days.  But now the action took place, collecting 5 thousand dollars more than the required amount. <br><br>  <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/habitmoti/moti-your-smart-companion-for-better-habits%3Fref%3Dcategory_recommended">Participate for 99 dollars</a> <br><br><h3>  Sgnl - bone conduction headset </h3><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/4bf/746/c53/4bf746c5396d4c18aba229bc93452bab.gif"><br><br>  The creators of Sgnl from <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/sgnlstrap/sgnl-make-phone-calls-with-your-fingertip/creator_bio">Innomdle Lab</a> came up with a great idea to make a gesture for a phone call.  With this device you can use your own hand as a headset: just put your thumb on your ear.  It plays the role of a microphone, conducting the sound from Sgnl, which is nothing more than a watch strap with a microphone. <br><br>  The manufacturer offers several versions that must fit any major watch model.  Managed by a bracelet using an application for a smartphone, which, moreover, is a good planner (judging by the screenshots). <br><br>  At the moment, developers are close to the threshold of a million dollars, although only 50 thousand was enough to get started.  There are 18 more days to participate. <br><br>  <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/sgnlstrap/sgnl-make-phone-calls-with-your-fingertip%3Fref%3Dcategory_popular">Participate for 139 dollars</a> <br><br><h3>  ONEmicro - the right wireless acoustics </h3><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/8fe/390/c2e/8fe390c2e90c416aa22c80c1cc91019e.jpg"><br><br>  Engineers project <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/oneaudio/onemicro-the-worlds-smallest-audiophile-wireless-s/creator_bio">OneAudio</a> seems to have studied all the shortcomings of Bluetooth <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/oneaudio/onemicro-the-worlds-smallest-audiophile-wireless-s/creator_bio">speakers</a> .  And they suggested using the almost forgotten DECT technology for sound transmission.  According to their assurances, it will provide excellent sound quality without loss, full stereo, extended coverage.  <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/oneaudio/onemicro-the-worlds-smallest-audiophile-wireless-s%3Fref%3Dcategory_popular">ONEmicro</a> system - the beginning of the series, the most simple and logical development. <br><br>  In the future, the team plans to replenish its set with additional playback devices.  But already for the starter kit, work in multiroom mode is available. <br><br>  This is not the first action of OneAudio.  The first project has already taken off on Kickstarter, and in June 2017 will begin to be sent to buyers.  <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/oneaudio/onemicro-the-worlds-smallest-audiophile-wireless-s%3Fref%3Dcategory_popular">ONEmicro</a> should be launched at the end of August of the same year.  Instead of the required 15 thousand dollars, 25 thousand have now been collected - there is still 15 days ahead. <br><br>  <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/oneaudio/onemicro-the-worlds-smallest-audiophile-wireless-s%3Fref%3Dcategory_popular">Participate for 128 dollars</a> <br><br><h3>  PS How to buy on Kickstarter, if the project creators send out only in the USA </h3><br>  Unfortunately, not all projects offer international delivery.  But any of them can be issued using the service for sending goods from the United States <a href="http://pochtoy.com/">Pochtoy.com</a> : just register and get a virtual address. <br><br>  It is on him and need to arrange delivery of the project took place.  As soon as the shipment takes place, and the gadget arrives at our warehouse, the corresponding notification will come.  After you can complete the package with something interesting, choose a delivery method, pay for it and receive it at your nearest post office or directly at home. <br><br>  In the event that Kickstarter does not allow you to pay with your own card, you can use the American Pochtoy.com accounts using the ‚Äú <a href="http://pochtoy.com/page/how_to/">Full Escort</a> ‚Äù service, which you can read about in detail <a href="https://geektimes.ru/company/pochtoy/blog/279572/">here</a> . </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/397553/">https://habr.com/ru/post/397553/</a></p>
