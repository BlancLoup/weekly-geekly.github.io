At that time, it seemed to me one of the coolest ideas to organize such actions, where you can play the role of Santa Claus for a complete stranger, and at the same time receive a gift from the same completely stranger.  After this habropost, I learned that such a thing exists in general, which in principle gave further impetus to the writing of this bot.

      Last New Year's Day, I also had such an action at work, where every person in the room got a random person, and you had to give a gift to the person who fell out to you, and this person in turn also gives another person.  In the end, all remain with gifts and satisfied. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  In the last year I had a hobby to create bots on the VK platform, even simply without releasing them into the world, but just for myself.  I started creating various bots for myself, I had a public of my city, which at that time I attracted a lot of people with the help of a bot.  I liked that people could spend a lot of time poking into the bot's functionality, and they got pleasure from it, which motivated me to constantly look for new ideas on how to please people, then several customers addressed me to write bots for their publics, and everyone was happy. <br><br>  So, I wanted to switch from VK <s>(what is there to catch actually already?)</s> In Telegram, since I heard that this is an excellent platform for bots.  And of course, in order to make a bot, you need an idea.  The idea came almost immediately, because the New Year is coming, and the bot in the form of the ‚ÄúSecret Santa‚Äù is not a common thing in Telegram, and the desire to write it was a long time ago.  Just in the form of sites, as for me, it does not make sense to do this, because there are a lot of such sites.  And in the period of some time I sat down to read the <a href="https://core.telegram.org/bots/api">Telegram BOT API</a> documentation (because I was completely unfamiliar, this is my first project on this platform), I looked for Open Source bots on Github, I watched how people worked out, sat down for a while, wrote as I want it to look like.  Actually further, I want to introduce you to my creation. <br><br><h3>  What it looks like now </h3><br>  A user is greeted by a welcome message before the game, which explains that the game has two modes: single and command. <br><br>  <b>Single</b> under himself provides that the user finds a completely random Santa (within his country).  The user presses the button that he wants to find a completely random Santa, the system registers him, and every hour he walks and combines those who do not have it.  Within an hour (if, of course, at this moment there are users from your country, also without Santa), the user will receive a message with information about his recipient, and also about the fact that Santa is found. <br><br>  <b>The command</b> gives the right to users to unite in rooms.  This is well suited to those who, for example, in offices, or in a large team of friends want to give each other gifts.  One person creates a room in the bot, the bot gives the room number to the leader of the room where he can invite other people.  People enter the room of this room and fall into it.  To start the game, there should be an even number of users in the room, and the leader of the room should click / play.  After that, the bot will mix all users and everyone will get its Santa, each person in the room will receive a personal message from Bot, with the data where to deliver the gift.  You cannot leave the room if the user has already got Santa.  However, the room can be left if the user has not yet received Santa.  The leader (creator) of a room cannot leave the room if there is at least someone besides him. <br><br>  After the start of the game, the bot asks the user for information about his country, city, address, name, wishlist (each user can write a list of desires that Santa can listen to).  Further, the person either joins the room, either creates it, or finds the accidental Santa outside the rooms.  After you send a gift to the address of your recipient, you must click / sent (the bot will notify the recipient that you sent the parcel, and it does not take long to wait).  When the package arrives, you can hit / delivered (all these commands are in the commands of the bot in navigation), and your Santa will receive a notification, with "plus karma and respect." <br><br>  The bot once a month also reminds those who have not yet sent a gift, that the New Year is coming soon, and there is no need to be a bad Santa, you need to hurry. <br><br>  Below I leave a few screenshots of the bot. <br><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">A couple of bot screens</b> <div class="spoiler_text"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/-e/ir/sv/-eirsvhcpqlwedrbvjz9flgjqbu.jpeg"><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/pq/ir/29/pqir299qecegchhlysyuvbeqcyq.jpeg"><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/aa/tk/oq/aatkoqivpzggxpatjbghftpobsu.jpeg"><br></div></div><br><h3>  What is implemented </h3><br>  I will not dwell on the technical part at all (perhaps the topic of another post), just for those interested I will name, with the help of what I developed. <br><br>  PHP: PHP 7 <br>  <b>DBMS</b> : MySQL <br>  <b>SDK</b> : <a href="https://telegram-bot-sdk.readme.io/docs">Telegram BOT PHP SDK</a> <br><br>  Anyone interested in the bot can be found in the Telegram as <a href="https://t.me/HappySecretSantaBot">@HappySecretSantaBot</a> <br><br>  All the great December, write bots (this is cool), and with the "coming" New Year! </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/432270/">https://habr.com/ru/post/432270/</a></p>
