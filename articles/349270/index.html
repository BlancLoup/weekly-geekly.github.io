  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Student Insider: Keyhole News</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  If you rewind the tape about eleven years ago (in some cases, the figure is smaller, in some cases it is more, but this is not the point), then we recall how we once wanted to start working as soon as we were on the threshold of the university, or already sitting at a lecture. .  We waited for a sign on where to send forces to succeed, or did not wait, and asked questions to those who are a bit more experienced.  But what if someone offered us a minute, if not a few hours, to look into the keyhole and see ourselves in the future?  Perhaps even meet your colleagues.  Essentially, this is Student Insider. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/b9f/642/4a8/b9f6424a8a2e366fbb1b4925a6f3b8b5.png" alt="image"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  The first student conference EPAM gathered more than 130 people in one room who were not indifferent to their future profession.  They invited mainly second and third year students, because this audience already has enough knowledge.  For those who did not have time to register or simply could not come to the conference, a live broadcast was conducted. <br><br>  <b>Olga Fedorinchik, Senior Marketing Specialist EPAM:</b> <br><blockquote><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/1b5/9db/a39/1b59dba39ff183a389a824bf25aa1701.png" alt="image" align="left">  ‚ÄúThere was a great demand from the students.  Even had to close the registration a week earlier than we planned.  This suggests that student-oriented events are not enough.  And this suggests that it is worth developing a student community, and such events are part of global work.  We create a platform not only for the exchange of knowledge "senior and junior" in the profession, but also for students to communicate with each other.  At the conference, the agenda was composed in such a way that students would learn about the development possibilities in production and that we have many non prod directions.  For example, projects for physicians, which Ivan Zatsepin spoke about, our IT volunteering in the report of Maria Bryantseva and Inna Yefimchuk ... You can participate in volunteer projects without being an employee of the company. ‚Äù </blockquote><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/42f/212/585/42f212585a1a40db3e25791eaf116863.jpg" alt="image">

      Openness and willingness to share knowledge is a feature of this conference.  EPAM's experience includes the expertise of 25,000 colleagues around the world, which is why the speakers talked about real case studies and answered all, even the most tricky questions.  For example, which is better than .Net or Java. <br><br>  We had to look for the answer to Alexander Shaduro, who spoke with the report ‚Äú.Net is fashionable!‚Äù. <br><br>  <b>Alexander Shaduro, Lead Resource Development Lab Head EPAM:</b> <br><blockquote><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/e4a/f98/120/e4af9812033a334bbf443010077baaec.png" alt="image" align="left">  ‚ÄúMy report is worth a look to those who are in the process of choosing a technology or framework with which they plan to link a career.  There are many articles on this topic, but usually the discussion ends with a holivar.  The main favorites for corporate development are, of course, .NET and JAVA.  Of course, no one clears C, C ++, Ruby on Rails or PHP, but they have a fairly narrow niche.  And people still want not only stability, but also want to be sure that the technology will continue to develop, and they along with it.  An example would be Microsoft's Azure or .NET Core.  I think that Java with its conservatism loses the evolution of .Net.  Our ‚Äúdark side‚Äù (and for me in ‚ÄúStar Wars‚Äù they still control dark forces), though more unpredictable, but more driving.  I wanted to tell and show that .NET is much broader and more interesting than is commonly believed, and I hope that I partially managed to do it. ‚Äù </blockquote><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/638/2f7/1cd/6382f71cd567a3d51df761d5a6cc5001.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  To answer the already familiar question ‚ÄúHow to enter IT‚Äù, a panel discussion was organized at the conference, where colleagues in the field, but not on expertise, each told their own story.  The most ‚Äúyoung‚Äù IT specialist of this conversation, Olga Chausova, is in EPAM for six months.  She went through the laboratory and now works at the company as a tester.  The most experienced in this dialogue, Nikita Syskov, celebrated in the field of 11 years.  ‚ÄúThe secret is that there is no success,‚Äù the performance began with these words, ‚ÄúThe secret is to achieve success every day again and again, to constantly grow and develop.‚Äù  Each of the speakers told his story: Maxim Borisov - about how he became a UX-designer, Yuri Semenov - about the way to business analytics, and Vadim Anisimov about how he came from trading in IT and never regretted it.  In this discussion, most of the time was given a Q &amp; A session. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/f00/69d/aa0/f0069daa025566dc09929885ffbe70f5.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Not less questions were asked and Vadim Volkov, who spoke about a rare profession in the field. <br><br>  <b>Vadim Volkov, Chief Performance Analyst EPAM:</b> <br><blockquote><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/cb4/2da/24e/cb42da24e99fa5b8836eacd495cb5315.png" alt="image" align="left">  ‚ÄúMost of the students most likely think that there are two professions in IT: programmers and testers.  In fact, there are many more professions.  And some of them are specific and interesting.  About one of these, I told.  Performance analytics is somewhere between administration, testing, and programming.  We know how to make large complex computer systems work as efficiently as possible.  And we, people with this profession, are quite few ‚Äù. </blockquote><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/0a6/8c0/321/0a68c03218360a0f6d5834a9206080c9.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  The reports in two streams were arranged to cover the maximum number of directions.  Not without talk about Data Science: Mikhail Karanik compared expectation and reality, Ivan Isachenko revealed a secret in the report ‚ÄúWho are you, Mr. BI?‚Äù, Victor Vedmich dispelled 7 myths about DevOps, Andrei Zhilka allowed listeners to look under the hood of EPAM Garage, and Valentine Thunder told how to change the country without changing work. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/243/b77/759/243b77759872592a3655fdc73d66640e.jpg" alt="image"><br>  A separate block was devoted to testing.  Olga Polstiuk devoted her report to artificial intelligence in testing, and Vitaly Shulga, together with the audience, was looking for the answer to the question of what is automated testing - the ‚Äúkiller‚Äù of manual testing, a fashion trend or a silver bullet? <br><br>  <b>Vitaly Shulga, Test Automation Lab Head:</b> <br><blockquote><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/29b/b27/827/29bb278277b7b04eea7571d6a9bc8fe4.png" alt="image" align="left">  ‚ÄúAn automator is a person who saves customer time and money.  And the one who allows you to free your colleagues from routine tasks: checks, accurate data entry, working with the API.  All this can be automated.  The advantages are obvious: the program will never get tired, will not miss the extra character, will not be distracted by lunch and work without sleep and weekends.  The program can perform 1,000 tests per hour, while a person takes a week.  Without it, releases of iPhones, VR-glasses and many other technologies that are very popular today are impossible.  It frees people for analytics, decision making and exploratory testing ‚Äî something that the machine cannot do for now.  But automation is not always profitable: if a project is short-term or too expensive to automate, then manual testing is needed. ‚Äù </blockquote><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/b27/3da/fd3/b273dafd31512c2655549de183ec2afd.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Vitaly devoted another report to the blockchain's HYIP theme.  With the advent of cryptocurrency, we expected to see the digital economy with its bonuses in action and the emergence of smart contracts.  And we got a lot of unresolved questions, the answers to which the whole world has been looking for for 10 years. <br><br>  In order not to spend the same amount of time searching for an answer to the eternal "who I want to be," Student Insider was definitely worth a visit.  Live communication with those who went down this path a few years ago will definitely help those who are looking to find it.  Well and, you see, to look into the keyhole is always curious. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/040/d9c/aab/040d9caaba6b925e5a90248d26d91eae.jpg" alt="image"></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/349270/">https://habr.com/ru/post/349270/</a></p>
