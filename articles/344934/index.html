You can treat it differently, but most importantly, it seems that you can learn what is useful from him, and not in which party he is and what religion he professes.  As Stephen Covey has bequeathed to us, you can learn something from any person if you have such a goal - to learn and develop. <br><br>  I'll tell you what I learned from Klitschko.  If this story is useful to you, in any form - great.  Programmers should help each other. <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  I somehow accidentally read about jab Klitschko.  In boxing, I am not an expert, but I will try to explain (to those who are also not an expert).

      When a boxer is standing, he has one hand slightly in front, the other slightly behind.  The one that is slightly behind (right-handed - right) beats the cross - a direct blow, very strong, because  he has a big trajectory and the energy of practically the whole body is invested in it. <br><br>  Hand, which is slightly ahead, beats a jab - a short, quick blow.  It is not as strong as cross, but it runs faster and easier.  As a result, it can be used more often. <br><br>  So, Klitschko made a jab one of the most important elements of his strategy (according to analysts and coaches, I didn‚Äôt think).  He beats the jab often and a lot, exhausting the opponent, preventing him from striking.  Due to the frequent use of the jab, Klitschko has become stronger than the average boxer - to put it simply, he pumped it. <br><br>  And this Jeb Klitschko sunk into my soul.  Not as a boxing pitch, but as an element of a strategy leading to victory. <br><br>  I abstracted from boxing, and looked at jab Klitschko through the prism of my life, first of all the part that flows at work. <br><br>  I laid out Jeb Klitschko into two fundamental elements: <br><br>  ‚Ä¢ Simplicity and availability of implementation; <br>  ‚Ä¢ Regularity of use. <br><br>  Simple, understandable, short action, performed regularly, helping to win. <br><br>  The brain immediately began to look for analogies, and there were a lot of them. <br><br>  Zeland in Transurfing constantly says: the main condition for the success of practice is regularity.  Who reads, remembers - 30 minutes, but always every day. <br><br>  The founder of the company Rolf said: if you want to improve something, improve what you can reach. <br><br>  Stephen Covey said that the main thing is the balance of the sides of life, and the balance is held on a regular basis. <br><br>  He, Stephen Covey, says that it is necessary to sharpen a saw - to develop regularly in the chosen area, at least a little, but every day or week. <br><br>  Gandapas says - start with what is.  No sneakers - run in shoes and a suit.  The main thing is to start and continue. <br><br>  Ancient Chinese torture, when water drips on a man‚Äôs head, says that the formula ‚Äúsmall action + regularity‚Äù works in a wide variety of areas. <br><br>  Well, our, Russian, "water wears away a stone", exactly the same thing. <br><br>  You know all this, and you will give a million more examples. <br><br>  Specifically, I was punched by Jeb Klitschko (in the figurative sense) - not because I ‚Äúunderstood‚Äù - it was clear before.  I decided to make this understanding a part of my professional and personal life. <br><br><h4>  What for? </h4><br>  There were several goals. <br><br>  First, if you believe in Klitschko‚Äôs example, you can make small, simple actions a weighty element of victory, in every sense of the word. <br><br>  It's like charging, or is there learning English.  You understand that in order to keep yourself in good shape, and at least not to degrade, you must do some physical activity regularly.  Much has been written on this subject, I will not repeat.  There is no need for 2 hours every day to hang around in the gym - this is for athletes and sports results. <br><br>  Secondly, the phrase that I often met in books did not give rest: do what others do not want to do, and you will win.  This is not an exact quote, because  In different sources there are different options. <br><br>  I wanted to learn regularity and discipline.  I watched a lot of people, and saw that everyone had problems with discipline.  In business, this leads to serious problems and failures - a lot of plans are built, a lot of rallies happen, at which everyone says: ‚ÄúEverything!  Getting a new life!  Now we will act like this! ‚Äù  After a couple of days, the enthusiasm disappears, the routine is sucked in, and all beginnings are gone.  It is clear that a person with a developed discipline of introducing changes into his life acquires a serious competitive advantage. <br><br>  Thirdly, the systemic brain wanted to understand why it is so difficult - to do something small and useful every day.  What is the problem, why a lot of time management methods, MBA diplomas and beautiful ties do not allow, for example, steep managers to force themselves to follow the rules, they themselves and developed.  It is clear that the system "decided - and do" has a vulnerability. <br><br>  Fourth, it‚Äôs boring to "just work."  It is necessary to develop. <br><br><h4>  System </h4><br>  As a real programmer, I created for myself an automated development accounting system.  He called it "Project Klitschko." <br><br>  What for, you ask?  There are after all known practices, such as check-lists and TODO-lists.  You write what you need to do, you do, you tick, and here it is, happiness. <br><br>  But there is one trouble - check-lists are born and die in one day, like moths.  The checklist answers two questions: <br><br>  1. What should I do today? <br>  2. What have I done today? <br><br>  But yesterday?  And a week ago?  And how did I spend this week in general?  How many jabs have I performed?  And in a month?  And compare the weeks with each other?  And the dynamics from month to month? <br><br>  If you are a programmer, then you understand that you need a simple accounting - you need to write to the database, what needs to be done, and what's done, every day.  Then, having such a database, the answers to all the questions will be found by themselves. <br><br>  I created such an automated system for myself.  Language hardly turns to call it an automated system, the business was for 1 hour, but oh well. <br><br>  The chip is simple, like picking your nose - write down what you did and what didn't.  Have statistics for each day, in numbers, not in emotions. <br><br>  You could, of course, keep records on paper checklists, store them and analyze them, but there is a chance to get into this situation: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/gl/eh/hp/glehhppqlse6g7pitlwnt6fajbw.jpeg"><br><br><h4>  Practice </h4><br>  Now it was necessary to choose what, how and when to do it.  The choice is huge, but you need something from the current work - both useful for me and the business, simple, with an obvious result. <br><br>  I decided to choose what was in line with the principle ‚Äúto do what others do not do‚Äù - independently, on my own initiative, without setting tasks, developing the system and, if possible, business, as far as I can reach. <br><br>  Most people do not do this on their own initiative.  Everyone is waiting for tasks, projects, instructions, motivation.  So that someone could take it himself, without a project, a budget and an award, he would improve something ‚Äî hell you wait. <br><br>  This is normal, in general.  Or not normal?  I do not know.  But it reminds me of a vicious circle.  Business does not want to pay more, because people are inactive, they work only on orders, and even that is not very high quality.  And people do not want to be proactive, to look for opportunities for improvements and to implement them qualitatively, because they pay the same money, and maybe less, the initiative is considered punishable. <br><br>  This is the circle I decided to try to break. <br><br>  I chose the following as jabs: <br><br>  1. Setting up checks in the information system (implementation of the concept of a self-learning system); <br>  2. Coming up and formulating ideas and proposals for the development of the company; <br>  3. The implementation of their own and others' ideas for the development of the company; <br>  4. Setting up automatic task setting (implementation of the poster concept); <br>  5. Search for non-optimal code and its refactoring. <br><br>  I called all these actions jabs, recognized them as equivalent and established a rule: every working day I have to do any of these actions.  One, any, but - until the end and every day. <br><br>  In order not to deceive and enrage anyone, I worked on jabs for lunch, i.e.  instead of lunch.  Anyway, lunch is evil. <br><br>  Briefly explain the selected jabs.  The main thing is that I did not carry out the tasks that someone had set for me.  If I was given the task of optimizing the code, then I performed it during business hours, and it did not count as a jab. <br><br>  Now the points. <br><br>  1. Checks are an abstract mechanism that makes 1C better, better data, reduces the number of errors.  But it must be filled.  I found a mistake script, made a check, life became better. <br><br>  1C, which was in the yellow box, did not know anything about our company.  Checks help to teach 1C to ‚Äúhow it is accepted here,‚Äù and to learn quickly and efficiently. <br><br>  If you consider me as part of the system, you get self-study.  I - as a translator, with one foot here, the other there.  The system looks at the world through my eyes, sees its mistakes, and adapts to be closer to the world. <br><br>  2 and 3. Our company had an automated system for recording proposals for improvement and their implementation.  Anyone could write something there, it was discussed there, was voted, and once it could be realized. <br><br>  There are two troubles in the company's development proposals: <br><br>  ‚Ä¢ They are served little, because  ‚ÄúBut still no one will do, nothing will change‚Äù; <br>  ‚Ä¢ They really will not do anything, and nothing will change. <br><br>  I decided to kill two birds with one stone - and created, and implemented the proposals. <br>  Proposals for implementation chose from those that relate to the information system. <br>  New ideas were not only written down by themselves, but also by strangers that people told me orally, but they did not register in the system, because ‚Äúwell, nobody will do it anyway ...‚Äù <br><br>  4. Automatic task setting is a tool for quick description and change of business processes.  Exactly what is invested in the poster.  But this mechanism is abstract, as is the verification of data from claim 1, so the main condition for its useful use is to fill it, i.e.  describe and launch new processes. <br><br>  5. Refactoring the braking system places is just one of my favorite things to do.  You see yourself, or people complain, or the measurement system reports where the brakes are. <br>  You open the measurement of performance, and went to the mind to bring.  Kayf. <br><br><h4>  Process </h4><br>  It was terribly lazy, especially the first days.  The flash-durk worked constantly - for four days you didn‚Äôt do anything, in the fifth one you will gather and bahn the jab, and that‚Äôs all - the complete feeling that the whole week has gone well. <br><br>  And then you look at the statistics - 1 day out of 5, i.e.  20% of their own plan.  Wiping snot, forcing yourself, remembering goals, thinking it all up yourself, and you don‚Äôt have to answer to anyone, and it becomes easier. <br><br>  As a result, the durilka was quickly overcome, and during the first month the habit of doing something useful every day was developed. <br><br><h4>  results </h4><br>  Specifically, with these jabs I worked for 3 months, i.e.  about 60 business days. <br><br>  During this time: <br><br>  1. Set up about 30 checks of primary documents, as a result of which the procedure for closing the month and correcting analytics was halved; <br><br>  2. Wrote about 200 new ideas for the development of the company; <br><br>  3. Implemented about 80 ideas for the development of the company. <br>  As a by-product, there was an increase in people's interest in the system of ideas and suggestions.  They understood that "at least someone in this company changes something."  And they began to write more sentences. <br><br>  4. Fully entangled with the right tasks two massive processes - procurement and money management.  The purchase turned out to be an incredible quality controlling system - simple, fast, easy, responsive. <br><br>  5. Optimized the verification of p. 1 by implementing three ways of executing the layout scheme in 1C.  I optimized the autotasks from p. 4. I made asynchronous batching, which speeds up the recording of primary documents at times.  Etc. <br><br><h4>  Results and development </h4><br>  The goals, process and results of the Klitschko project I presented at the strategic session of the company as one of the ways to improve the efficiency of the manager‚Äôs work (by that time I was already the CIO). <br><br>  Specifically, that part of the Klitschko project that I described in this publication was only the first experience, but it also brought tangible results for the company.  Here are the main ones: <br><br><ul><li>  A normal, correct practice of improvements appeared in the company ‚Äî it was seen by both the people and the management.  I offered to add motivation, helped select the numbers, the management agreed and everything started to turn around - the proposals began to be added and implemented; </li><li>  The company in full force earned a very cool procurement system.  One of the main indicators - the majority of suppliers who left the company for some reason, at a new job wanted the same.  They were asked to sell, they were asked to do, they were asked to at least sit with them at the meeting with the automation, they were asked to let them on the tour. </li><li>  UPP continued to spin on an old server, with 16 GB of RAM and 4 cores, without generating performance problems. </li></ul><br>  To myself, the Klitschko project gave a lot more.  I understood the power of regularity and discipline, and I learned to consciously, systematically and consistently seek discipline from myself.  And then from the others. <br><br>  Having become a CIO, I learned with the help of jabs correct, effective and interesting regular management.  This is a good, but a separate topic, somehow get together and write about it. <br><br>  Jeb and regularity played a significant role in the experiment with the acceleration of programmers 4 times. <br><br>  Thanks to the jabs, I realized where, in which sand, the strategic development of companies was leaking, and in general all the changes. <br><br>  Jeb helped to understand what is wrong with managers, why they very often tread on the spot, being very busy at the same time - they run all day, as they were established, and the result is so-so. <br><br>  Subsequently, I developed the ideas of the Klitschko project into the theme of managing task flows, but this is a completely different story. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/344934/">https://habr.com/ru/post/344934/</a></p>
