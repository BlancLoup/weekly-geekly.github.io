  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Fujitsu is going to put the production of wireless charging on stream</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  And the company promises to do this by 2012.  Of course, you will have to wait another year and a half, but for now Fujitsu seems to be one of the few companies that promised to launch the production of wireless chargers not in the near future, as is usually said in concept announcements, but after a year and a half.  Now the design of this charge is being developed, plus the development of specifications. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a>  It is worth noting that the ideas and concepts of wireless chargers have been demonstrated several times - some people even started selling wireless chargers there (to be honest, I don‚Äôt remember who).  Fujitsu is going to offer a universal device that will be suitable for most mobile devices and laptops with netbooks. <br><br>  Now Intel, and Motorola, and Samsung are fighting over such developments - everyone is trying to be the first to do such a charge, because the main income from the release will go to the ‚Äúpioneer‚Äù, of course, if the device turns out really successful.  Such charging uses the principle of magnetic resonance, which has long been known.  The device offered by Fujitsu uses two electric coils that resonate at frequencies of about 10 megahertz.  Interestingly, if the resonance range is lowered, then the distance between the charging and the charging device may be greater.

      Interestingly, such a gadget seems to be harmless to health as well, because such charging works mainly in the magnetic spectrum and at low frequencies.  Of course, after the mass introduction of wireless chargers, some unpleasant fact of harm can ‚Äúsurface‚Äù, but the manufacturer claims that all this is completely safe for you and our health.  Let's hope that this is true. <br><br>  The problem for using wireless charging is also the ability to simultaneously charge multiple devices.  Now prototypes made in Fujitsu, can charge up to three devices at the same time - but the developers want to increase the "ceiling" of the number of devices.  Energy losses during transmission are up to 15%, which, in principle, is acceptable for a similar method of charging batteries. <br><br>  More detailed technical details are unfortunately unavailable - their company simply does not provide.  Of course, it can be understood - technical developments are really better kept secret, competitors are not sleeping.  And all the more, such competitors as Chinese manufacturers are quite capable of taking the concept and, on its basis, quickly set up the production of wireless charging, which will surely be snapped up like hotcakes. <br><br>  <a href="http://news.yahoo.com/s/pcworld/20100913/tc_pcworld/fujitsueyeswirelessgadgetchargingfor2012">Source of</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/104147/">https://habr.com/ru/post/104147/</a></p>
