Hayter with it?‚Äù</i>  <i>Why do I, an excellent developer, need to spend time on this article?</i>  " <br><br>  might think you, my dear friend.  No need to waste time.  This is just an evening fiction with a share of unfunny humorous ones.  The text will be about the library <a href="https://github.com/IvanVorobei/SPPermission">RequestPermission</a> and about its mysterious author. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Let's start with the main thing - rebranding!  Library renamed to <a href="https://github.com/IvanVorobei/SPPermission">SPPermission</a> .  I don‚Äôt know if this is the case or not, but after changing the name, it‚Äôs already been hanging in the <a href="https://github.com/trending/swift">top of GitHub</a> for the second week.  Yes, there is such a top, it is conditional, but still interesting projects can be found there.  The author (mysterious person), updated banners on <a href="https://github.com/IvanVorobei/SPPermission">the project page</a> , description, a huge section <i>donated</i> inserted.  What greedy! <br><br>  But let's move on to the project itself:

    <img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/g8/b4/pb/g8b4pbkznhzv5e-fhz_rifcodpo.gif" width="600"><br><br>  As you can see from the huge size of the gifs <i>(non-Orthodox 4 megabytes)</i> , the project requests a list of permissions, there are icons, text.  You can even say that it looks good. <br><br><h3>  Install </h3><br>  You can simply drag the source to your project, this is a folder of structured files.  And you can <s>not suffer nonsense</s> to build a library using <i>CocoaPods</i> .  Pros and cons will not tell, not about this article.  Add a line to the <i>pod</i> file: <br><br><pre><code class="ruby hljs">pod <span class="hljs-string"><span class="hljs-string">'SPPermission'</span></span></code> </pre> <br>  and update dependencies.  Most likely, this is the most difficult step of all the upcoming) <br><br><h3>  We use </h3><br>  If you simply dragged files into the project, the <i>SPPermission</i> module <i>is</i> already available.  If you <s>did not suffer from nonsense,</s> use <i>CocoaPods</i> , then you should import the library into the controller: <br><br><pre> <code class="plaintext hljs">import SPPermission</code> </pre><br>  Now in the <i>viewDidAppear</i> function <i>we will</i> call the following construction: <br><br><pre> <code class="plaintext hljs">override func viewDidAppear(_ animated: Bool) { super.viewDidAppear(animated) SPPermission.Dialog.request( with: [.camera, .calendar, .notification], on: self ) }</code> </pre><br>  We transfer the list of permissions and the controller on which we will present the dialog box.  It remains to run the project. <br><br><h3>  Customization </h3><br>  If you, dear friend, worked with tables or collections, the words <i>Delegate</i> and <i>DataSource</i> will not scare.  And if a little obsessed with patterns, then even cry out: <br><br>  - ‚Äú <i>Wow!</i>  <i>Protocol-oriented approach!</i>  " <br><br>  You see!  See?  And I said it would not be funny.  But once read to this line, then go ahead. <br><br>  Let's start with the <i>SPPermissionDialogDataSource</i> protocol, it will be responsible for customizing the dialog box and will allow the library to be more loyally integrated into the project.  Let's look at the parameters: <br><br><pre> <code class="plaintext hljs">@objc public protocol SPPermissionDialogDataSource: class { @objc optional var dialogTitle: String { get } @objc optional var dialogSubtitle: String { get } @objc optional var dialogComment: String { get } @objc optional var allowTitle: String { get } @objc optional var allowedTitle: String { get } @objc optional var bottomComment: String { get } @objc optional var showCloseButton: Bool { get } @objc optional func name(for permission: SPPermissionType) -&gt; String? @objc optional func description(for permission: SPPermissionType) -&gt; String? @objc optional func image(for permission: SPPermissionType) -&gt; UIImage? }</code> </pre><br>  To be honest, I don‚Äôt see any reason to dwell on everyone, as their names speak.  Let's <i>analyze a</i> couple of ambiguous: <i>bottomComment</i> and <i>showCloseButton</i> . <br><br>  The first parameter is responsible for the comment under the dialog box; there you can put, for example, the hint " <i>Swipe to close</i> ": <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/o3/ju/ol/o3juolykpylxcrkpb1jumil_t5s.jpeg"><br><br>  The second parameter, <i>showCloseButton</i> , is responsible for the close button in the upper right corner of the screen.  I also have a picture with an example: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/dx/8z/va/dx8zva68cc4b6zwllgs5yk95ps0.jpeg"><br><br>  Some functions allow <i>nil</i> to be returned, this is necessary if you do not need to customize all titles / icons or text.  It is enough to return <i>nil</i> to leave the default value: <br><br><pre> <code class="plaintext hljs">func description(for permission: SPPermissionType) -&gt; String? { if permission == .calendar { return "" } lse { return nil } }</code> </pre><br>  It remains to transfer the <i>DataSource</i> object to the main structure: <br><br><pre> <code class="plaintext hljs">SPPermission.Dialog.request( with: [.camera, .calendar, .microphone, .notification], on: self, dataSource: self )</code> </pre><br><h3>  Delegate </h3><br>  It allows you to track some events.  Let's look at the protocol: <br><br><pre> <code class="plaintext hljs">@objc public protocol SPPermissionDialogDelegate: class { @objc optional func didHide() @objc optional func didAllow(permission: SPPermissionType) }</code> </pre><br>  Hmm, not a lot ... But although, what else do you need?) I don‚Äôt need to explain at what events the functions will be called.  The names speak.  I draw your attention - the delegate must not forget to specify: <br><br><pre> <code class="plaintext hljs">SPPermission.Dialog.request( with: [.camera, .calendar, .microphone, .notification], on: self, delegate: self dataSource: self )</code> </pre><br><h3>  Permissions </h3><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/og/ow/qt/ogowqtraw3cz4vrwpjjupu4vmuo.jpeg"><br><br>  The list will be updated if there are any suggestions or criticisms for the library, it is worth creating a new issue <a href="https://github.com/IvanVorobei/SPPermission/issues">here.</a> <br><br><h3>  Buns </h3><br>  It is worth paying attention to the useful function: <br><br><pre> <code class="plaintext hljs">func isAllow(_ permission: SPPermissionType) -&gt; Bool</code> </pre><br>  It will let you know if the user has given permission.  In order to increase loyalty, it is recommended to request permissions not before a bundle, but before use.  And no more than 3 ex!  Although it is difficult for me to think of a situation where I need more) Use this: <br><br><pre> <code class="plaintext hljs">let isAvailableCamera = SPPermission.isAllow(.amera)</code> </pre><br><h3>  Why was it updated </h3><br>  The old version looked like this, and maybe a year ago it was nothing: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/270/1d0/037/2701d00370d74987ae03348cc59d24b0.gif" width="600"><br><br>  Actually, I did not update it for a year (oh well, don‚Äôt pretend that I didn‚Äôt understand that I was the author of the library), and more recently, I received a letter ... although let's talk about this story a little later.  We are doing serious business here! <br><br><h3>  Architecture </h3><br>  About a year ago I wrote <a href="https://habr.com/post/326620/">an article</a> in which I was directly trashed against lovers of unjustified use of architecture.  But only I thought so, and the main message was not heard.  My desire to simplify this year has not stopped.  When I thought of a redesign, I realized that I would have to rewrite the project entirely.  This is some kind of drilling rig with the ability to listen to the radio, cut vegetables and a heater on the floor rate.  I saw it a year later!  Now it seems to me it was stupid to write <a href="https://habr.com/post/326620/">this article</a> , having such a complicated example.  Probably, in one more year, I will make everything even easier.  We'll see) <br><br><h3>  So what's the story? </h3><br>  Tutorial sobsna ended and we turn to the chatter.  A few weeks ago I received a letter asking me to explain how the library works.  It was a strange question, and since I abandoned the library, I simply answered the template one: <br><br>  - ‚Äú <i>Dear friend, I do not support the library now, I do not have free time.</i>  <i>Have a nice day</i> ‚Äù <br><br>  That's right, and wrote only in Zabugorsk.  And forgot.  Having entered poppy, I saw about a dozen !!!  messages in the spam folder.  All right, obviously some kind of portal was sold, now how can I unsubscribe from their mailing!  And nnnet ... I wrote the same guy, only this time in anger.  In the letters, I learned that I was not the author of the library (and therefore I could not tell), I learned that people like me are the most terrible people (and we need to ban registration on GitHub), I learned that I want a lot of money for my worthless work.  Of money?  On the old page there was not even a Donat form.  But I understood the point, the man was just angry. <br><br>  I decided to help, but not because of kindness - I was incredibly interested in what such incredible things needed to be customized, which provoked a huge wave of anger.  It turned out he was looking for a method that is called when the dialog box is closed.  My laughter through tears had no limits!  The delegate was described in the first version. <br><br>  The story is sad, but further is even sadder!  Yes Yes!  I described in detail to him personally how to use delegates, so to speak, a general course.  I did not miss the opportunity to go crazy and said that all this was on the main page of the project from the very beginning.  I received the answer ... but I wanted to cry even more: <br><br>  ‚Äú <i>I recently started programming and don't want to understand the documentation.</i>  <i>Goodbye</i> ‚Äù <br><br>  I laughed for a long time. <br><br><h3>  We finish </h3><br>  A brief educational program was introduced, for attentive I will leave links to the <a href="https://youtu.be/1mDdX7fQRv4">timelapse with the design</a> (I unscrupulously lick off the indents and colors from the e-mail applications) and the <a href="https://youtu.be/viFDunOdyBg">tutorial</a> that will show everything I described here, but clearly. <br><br>  All successful migrations to the new Swift! </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/430886/">https://habr.com/ru/post/430886/</a></p>
