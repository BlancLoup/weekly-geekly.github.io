According to legend, this day should determine the vector of development of iOS development for the whole year and increase the morale of all iOS developers in the team.  Let's count together the number of words ‚ÄúAmazing,‚Äù ‚ÄúEver,‚Äù and ‚ÄúMachine Learning,‚Äù spoken from the stage during the event. <br><br>  This is a significant event for both programmers and ordinary Apple users: here, and about innovations in the system API, and about user services.  And, by the way, about hardware - although the event is primarily software-based, today Mac Pro has been updated for the first time in years.

      The iOS developers from the <a href="https://mobiusconf.com/%3Futm_source%3Dhabr%26utm_medium%3D454428">Mobius</a> conference program committee could not get past this event: in addition to the story ‚Äúthat they even presented‚Äù, we gave comments about our emotions from the listened and tried to answer the question whether it was still Apple or not. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br><h2>  What showed </h2><br>  The broadcast from the hall began on time, not a second sooner or later.  Apple has gone through innovations in all its operating systems. <br><br><h3>  Warm up </h3><br><ul><li>  To begin with, we showed a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3DHZS9M52Bd_w">trailer for the</a> new series ‚ÄúFor All Mankind‚Äù, so that we would not forget that Apple TV + service was coming in the fall with exclusive video content from the company itself. </li><li>  tvOS: The main changes were the multiplayer mode (so that after the child you don‚Äôt find a million cartoons in your recommendations) and the ability to connect PlayStation / Xbox gamepads. </li><li>  watchOS: The presentation began with a story about new applications for watches: here you will find both audiobooks, sound recording, sound meter, and even a calculator.  Also, there are even more opportunities for customizing the appearance of dials, developers have opened new APIs, for example, Streaming Audio API. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/vm/gf/6d/vmgf6dwadflpemxite8a7_5f1qi.png"></li><li>  But the biggest announcement in this part was the App Store on the clock: now you can search and install applications on the Apple Watch without using your iPhone.  In addition, Activity Trends has appeared, thanks to which it becomes even easier to keep track of its closing circles during the day. </li><li>  And finally, the Health App now uses Machine Learning, but stores all the data strictly on the device or in iCloud, because ‚ÄúYou control your data‚Äù. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/ba/1a/ue/ba1aueohu5xqrqviubd50kps78w.png"></li></ul><br><br><h3>  iOS </h3><br><ul><li>  Traditionally, Apple starts with statistics - 97 percent of users are satisfied with the use, 87 percent of iPhones are already using iOS 12, and the percentage of upgrades to the new version compared to Android is just off scale. </li><li>  Next was announced the next version of the OS with sequence number 13, and even before the features started talking about the performance.  It is alleged that FaceID is 30 percent faster waiting for us, applications will run twice as fast, and when they are downloaded from the App Store, users will have to download half as much.  In general, iOS-developers, if the authorities want to optimize the launch of the application, you can now respond "and he is optimized." </li><li>  But most of all, of course, they talked about the dark theme, so much loved by macOS.  It was like this: <br>  ‚ÄúSee how awesome application X looks like with a dark theme. <br>  See how amazing application Y with a dark theme looks like. <br>  See how awesome the Z application looks with a dark theme. ‚Äù <br><br>  Showing the possibilities of Dark Mode, Apple casually showed a new swipe keyboard as an achievement (here Android users laughed out loud, of course). <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/7p/co/ry/7pcory0asyrrcvhpjcppnlnaw2k.png"><br></li><li>  Apple devoted a lot of time and effort to privacy issues in new versions.  Now you can embed a button in your applications with the ability to log in using your Apple ID, in order not to send user data to social networks and IT giants.  <b>Update:</b> it turns out that if you are a developer and use authorization through third-party services in your application, then this option should be added.  Interestingly, antitrust authorities think about this. <br><br>  And if you don‚Äôt want to burn your email address at the same time, Apple will be able to generate a random one for you (probably, ad-tech representatives have strained here).  Also, users can now allow applications to use their geolocation only once (probably, some iOS developers have gotten tense here). <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/ev/zt/tt/evztttj4rgj_parzdkiourt2jj4.png"></li><li>  The long-suffering Apple Maps are being updated, now everything seems to be fine in the US (read: ‚Äúfinally everything will come close to Google Maps‚Äù).  And for "some other countries" everything should be good next year.  Why argue that Russia will not be one of them? </li><li>  In addition, the updated Siri, Photos, CarPlay and HomeKit were shown.  For example, if you take a lot of almost identical shots in a row (‚Äúwho knows which one is better‚Äù), you can select the ‚Äúonly the best‚Äù view mode and not watch replays.  And the video with the wrong orientation can now be rotated.  Interestingly, which of these will please the users more - a clever advanced AI innovation, or a simple turning function that could have been done years ago? </li><li>  <b>Update:</b> after the presentation two more points came to light.  First, it <a href="https://vc.ru/services/70259-apple-razreshit-zagruzhat-prilozheniya-po-sotovoy-seti-bez-ogranicheniy-po-razmeru-v-ios-13">will be possible</a> to download applications of any size via the mobile Internet.  Secondly, do not believe it, but 12 years after the appearance of iOS, the volume control will no longer cover all the content on the screen! <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/9v/lj/fk/9vljfkyqkqnnnxhaksn3ztmqxei.jpeg"></li><li>  It's very cool that Apple does not forget about tablets, about the fact that it is an independent device with its UX and its tasks, and not just a smartphone with a larger screen.  As a result, the operating system is now officially allocated to a separate <b>iPadOS</b> . <br><br>  It is not yet completely clear what this means for developers: whether iPadKit will appear, whether we need to replace UIView with iPadView in order to support iPads.  One thing we know: now in the Files application you can directly see USB devices and import your photos from cameras, and with three fingers you can do Ctrl-C and Ctrl-V. </li><li>  Apple has long flown into space with its pen - a very popular tool for designers.  Previously, he had latency 20ms, now only 9ms.  In addition, the developers of the private API are slightly open and now PencilKit can be used in their applications. <br></li></ul><br><br><h3>  macOS </h3><br><ul><li>  We started with hard news: a new Mac Pro is introduced (for the first time since 2013).  Talk about his design will long be shaken by social networks and forums (if it seems to you that the corpus looks like something, then know that it has already been joked about a million times). <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/yy/yt/us/yyytusyqmpolqhkatdovqc_s_js.png"><br><br>  It is clear that it is very powerful (for example, you can install up to one and a half terabytes of RAM).  And it is clear that it is very expensive: it starts at $ 5,999, and this is for the basic version, in which there are 32 gigabytes of RAM and a 256-gigabyte SSD that is ridiculous for such a price.  On sale in the fall. <br></li><li>  To such a system unit is needed and the monitor (quite a while Apple did not release them).  It is also presented, and it is also powerful - here you will find both Retina 6K and XDR (‚Äúmore than HDR‚Äù), and the cooling system (‚Äúso that you are brighter, my granddaughter‚Äù), and the ability to turn upright (‚Äúso and vertical photo retouching is more convenient, and coding "). <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/zo/xz/ok/zoxzokkhwomutekq9g_sdvqzxka.png"><br><br>  Called Pro Display XDR, diagonal 32 ".  It costs $ 4,999, while the stand must be purchased separately for a thousand dollars (this is not a joke).  On sale, too, in the fall. <br></li><li>  The new version of macOS is called Catalina. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/87/ig/41/87ig41buemufnr9cnas-2lkq5wy.png"></li><li>  Talk about iTunes and jokes about the fact that he can do everything - it remains to add a calendar and an email client inside iTunes.  In general, now on Macs instead of this combine there will be separate applications Music, Podcasts and TV.  And now nothing will automatically open when you connect an iPhone.  This was greeted with applause, but I suppose the reflex developed over the years will make users nervous the first time - why didn‚Äôt iTunes open?  Is everything alright? </li><li>  Apple in passing killed a couple of software companies, allowing the iPad to use the iPad as an interactive additional display for their Mac, the technology called SideCar.  Now separate Luna and Duet Display are not needed. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/sf/hm/nc/sfhmncxvylrcdjd_oz8lhfl8sgi.png"></li><li>  In addition, VoiceControl has improved, making computers more accessible for people with disabilities.  And after the demonstration of how he allows the text to be edited (‚Äúcorrect this word‚Äù), he will probably want to dictate the habraposta through it to those who are quite capable of typing them with their hands! </li><li>  Now you can not be afraid of losing your poppy - technology / application Find My will help you find a poppy, being offline. </li></ul><br><br><h3>  For iOS / macOS developers </h3><br>  Finally, after the announcements ‚Äúfor users‚Äù, the company turned to the developers gathered in the hall with what is specifically important for them. <br><br><ul><li>  Technology Catalyst (nee - Marzipan), which will help port existing mobile applications on the Mac.  It will be hard to say how well this will work, but the Atlassian demo is impressive. </li><li>  Apple continues to improve support for VR / AR - and this updated ARKit 3, and RealityKit, and Reality Composer.  They showed that now people are "impassable" (AR-objects will no longer block them) - this is spectacular, Google has not been able so far.  And immediately showed Minecraft Earth (‚Äúminecraft in the real world‚Äù), where this obstruction is very useful. </li><li> The new SwiftUI framework is our answer React Native.  Finally, ayosnikov will have a declarative UI. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/lo/l7/af/lol7af5utxejc5cyd63dyb9-va4.png"><br><br>  Already I see how in the next six months the speed of application development will increase by an order of magnitude, the quality of applications will increase, and users will not be able to put below 5 stars in the stack of applications written using SwiftUI.  Iosniki who went into React Native and Flutter development, come back, we will forgive everything. </li><li>  The first beta of the new OS versions are already available to developers. </li><li>  <b>Update:</b> After the presentation, Apple <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/6/3/18651359/apple-real-user-indicator-bot-detection-security-feature-ios-13-wwdc-19">told</a> separately what the Real User Indicator tool is doing to help developers distinguish bots from real users. </li></ul><br><hr><br><br><h2>  What do the members of the <a href="https://mobiusconf.com/%3Futm_source%3Dhabr%26utm_medium%3D454428">Mobius</a> conference committee think: </h2><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/g4/ab/yc/g4abycylvm-izrx0dorbszmoue8.jpeg" align="left">  <b>Peter Tretyakov (Redmadrobot)</b> <br><br>  ‚ÄúIn one of the books about Jobs there was a story about how in the 70s-80s he imagined the computer of the future.  He represented, of course, the iPad, but now with the iPadOS it now became similar to what he was telling. <br><br>  In general, the trend for the convergence of macOS and iOS has been going on for a long time.  The iOS version for the iPad is already very different from the version for the iPhone, so dividing them into two is just a fixation of the fact, rather than the announcement of a brand new operating system, as Apple usually likes to serve.  It‚Äôs right that Apple doesn‚Äôt step on the rake of Microsoft, but makes the desktop and mobile systems come closer and thoughtfully: they don‚Äôt allow desktop applications for mouse and keyboard to run on small screens of mobile devices with touch control.  Obviously, iOS applications will not have to be redone for the new iPadOS, but the experience of interacting with them on the iPad will be richer and more interesting.  And if you add a couple of platform tweaks about which they will be told in sessions in the coming days, there will be a class in general. <br><br>  As for the old-fashioned iOS, the dark theme was expected after a similar one for macOS, and this, of course, is not so gorgeges, wasps and amasing, as Craig said.  Although there is a chance that now dark themes for applications will somehow more or less follow the same style and look uniform, and not each with its own shade of gray. <br><br>  I waited for the whole presentation of Marzipan.  Even the new Mac Pro 6K-display did not lead me astray.  There, however, it was immediately obvious that it would be possible to buy it only in a mortgage.  Therefore, as soon as we started talking about macOS, I listened as a seminarian at a Sunday school.  And here he is, handsome Catalyst!  If JIRA Cloud soared on it, then we have a chance!  Although this dude from Atlassian did not click a single button in his application, he just clicked on the tabs, so we'll see.  You may have to throw everything with crutches so that the iOS application on macOS works fine, but now at least you can touch it. <br><br>  But then the song about SwiftUI went and I just started crying.  Declarative layout on iOS!  Of course, it will work in such a way that it will not work.  At least the first time.  How this will work for complex UI, animation, transitions is not clear.  But the fact that the UI is finally on Swift is very cool! ‚Äù <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/f0/l2/9n/f0l29nqcusx-amyrel8flkgdmzw.jpeg" align="left">  <b>Cyril Klebanov (Just LLC)</b> <br>  ‚ÄúFrom this WWDC I did not expect much and looked alone.  Of course, there were some interesting leaks, but all of a sudden it turned out to be true, and even a little more. <br><br>  At first, it seemed interesting to me to measure the noise in the clock, especially in our realities with noisy neighbors.  It would be great to automatically ask to turn down the sound during the party, and if it does not help, then contact the precinct). <br><br>  When the presentations say the word secure, as a user I calm down: it means that my personal data and photos in the shower are under reliable protection.  But from the developer‚Äôs point of view, this promises a variety of problems and difficulties with publishing to the page.  Now you need to be careful when working with geolocation.  But the input through the Apple ID from any point of view is necessary, and especially pleased that the user can determine what data he wants to provide. <br><br>  The only technical novelty was the new Mac Pro with a monitor, but how long have we been waiting for this moment.  It will be available for purchase only in the fall, which means there is time to collect mortgage documents for its purchase.  The only thing that comforts - the prices of these devices practically do not fall over time. <br><br>  AR-whales demonstrate a planned development: the capture of the movement of people, overlapping objects.  For complete happiness, all that is needed is dynamic lighting with tracing of rays and shadows. <br>  Dessert in the form of SwiftUI very much liked.  Many developers have been waiting for the declarative UI and asked for a long time, Apple finally heard us.  Now finally holivar will stop about how to typeset - in code or on storyboards. <br><br>  Keynote is just the tip of the iceberg, all the fun is waiting for us ahead in separate sections.  A whole week without sleep for iOS-macOS-iPadOs-developers is provided. " <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/en/wo/hb/enwohbddyu09ovpuohwaoprdrh8.jpeg" align="left">  <b>Anton Davydov (EPAM Systems)</b> <br>  ‚ÄúEvery year the dub-dub becomes more and more like a children's matinee - here you and the animators on the stage before the conference, and the interactive demos of the games, and the number of sarcasm and pranksters is only increasing.  But still waiting every year cherished evening to watch the broadcast. <br><br>  It is interesting to see how the vector of marketing policy at Apple has changed: if they had previously promoted devices, now they are increasingly paying attention to their services, which, of course, work by subscription.  It is clear, almost every iPhone, and very few people are going to update it every year. <br><br>  The last few conferences do not take place without the use of VR / AR demo, but as for me, as long as the normal use cases can be extended to three and a half applications.  But if you are tired of playing with fonts and creating views, then ARKit and RealisticKit will be the one. <br><br>  Apple continues to focus on improving user privacy issues, and so far the company has not been seen in privacy scandals.  On the background of Facebook and some other large companies, Apple looks more trustworthy and gets a plus in karma.  My favorite functionality of the announced was the ability to allow applications to use geolocation only once, which is very convenient - now you don‚Äôt need to go into system settings after permission to prohibit using geolocation, camera, microphone and similar services. <br><br>  Cherry on the cake was a declarative freymork for UI - SwiftUI, you could only tell about him in general, and finish the broadcast.  Interestingly, before the conference, several articles appeared on the topic of thinking about the declarative UI for Swift.  Coincidence, or did Apple's big hand fuel interest?
