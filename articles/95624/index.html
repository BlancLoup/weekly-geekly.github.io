      EXAMPLE 1 <br><h4>  MICROFINANCING </h4><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  At first glance, this seems like a serious business and is available only to banks or pawnshops. <br>  This is not true. <br><br>  In reality, microloans are not issued, but a regular agreement between a physical person and an individual about a loan of funds is concluded, but not more than 50 tr. <br>  Accordingly, no permissions are required. <br><br>  The technology is simple: <br>  - the cheapest office is removed, you can cooperate with someone; <br>  - in the beginning you can not hire workers, you can handle it yourself; <br>  - initial capital of 50-100 tr .; <br>  - 8-10% per day on the security of property. <br><br>  That's the whole business.  Why is it a one-time ask you?  Because during the crisis, banks stopped issuing loans, and people began to lose their jobs - and very few people would give money at the right moment. <br><br>  Accordingly, the key moment is a pledge. <br>  Many who are engaged in microfinance lend only on the security of real estate or cars.  So far you will not leave. <br>  It is necessary to give under any things having value. <br>  Example, microwave for 8 tr.  taken on bail with a loan of 500 rubles. <br>  All things must be with the documents or you know what will be fraught with consequences. <br>  Practice has shown that the average loan is equal to 3-10 tr.  for 5-10 days. <br>  For all the time of work, due to debt repayment, only a few things remained. <br>  They take for different needs: to celebrate the wedding, on the day of the city, before the salary ... <br><br>  People went on the first day as soon as a pillar was put on the street, and the flow is constantly increasing, because  no need to mortgage an apartment or a car.  Although they are also mortgaged (there were also plots of land) - we had to agree with the nearest natarius about a quick and out-of-turn arrangement. <br>  You can't take gold, you need a bunch of papers and checks - but you yourself came from the pawnshop and offered to cooperate - we send them with gold, and they send us goods. <br><br>  In general, while the crisis, this one-time business is relevant and brings good money. <br><br>  If people are interested in this topic - there will be other examples. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/95624/">https://habr.com/ru/post/95624/</a></p>
