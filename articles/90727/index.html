And immediately after the thought habitually moves - when, finally, will make a convenient teleportation?  But with teleportation, while everything is sad, because you begin to think - and what can be done with the situation?  Building a new world from scratch to consider the sense of a little, realistic plans - our everything. <br>  Let us think a little about how our transport infrastructure could be adjusted for personal transport. <a name="habracut"></a><br>  Actually the prerequisites are as follows: <br>  1 Man is not perfect, automation on average can steer a car much better <br>  2 Automation does not cope with abnormal situations. <br>  3 For automatic control you need enough information about the outside world. <br><br>  What should be done: <br>  1 We supply our roads throughout their length with towers to <s>combat the Hontian threat of</s> continuous information exchange with cars, as well as for video surveillance of the road and surroundings. <br>  2 We supply our cars with boxes that can: <br>  2.1 Keep in touch with the towers <br>  2.2. Receive all internal data on vehicle systems. <br>  2.3 Optionally - to drive a car <br><br>  How we arrange everything: <br>  1 The car knows its position in space, with all 4 dimensions. <br>  2 Communicates with the tower, knows the position of all other road users, receives data about their maneuvers. <br>  3 Communicates with the tower, receives data on non-automated road users (cars without boxes, pedestrians and dogs that come close to the road, etc.) and, accordingly, can take some preventive measures <br>  4 The car transmits the parameters of its movement to the tower, both for internal systems - at what acceleration ABS (good rubber) turned on, when the system of exchange rate stability started to work, etc., and for external systems - a dimple on the road, frost.  Accordingly, the towers know how well the car system works, they can predict the braking distance for it, the speed of safe cornering.  In addition, knowing the parameters for the car and assessing the compliance of its movement with these parameters, the system quickly understands what the quality of the road surface is at the moment and adapts the trajectories, speed, etc. to it.  Naturally, all with a large margin. <br>  5 Car box can choose: only transfer data to the tower;  transfer data + advise;  transfer data + advise + in emergency, according to the system, cases to perform maneuvers;  fully control the car. <br>  Naturally, our bright dream to exclude a person from the management process in general. <br>  What else is important - it is clear that much attention is needed to non-automated road users.  But the towers see them, predict their trajectories of movement and the degree of predictability and, on this basis, can adequately respond to them. <br>  It is important to introduce boxes in cars everywhere. <br>  If we are transported to a bright future, where people no longer drive cars, and everything is done by automation, then: <br>  1 You can drive at optimum speed - if the vehicle system is normal, there are no unpredictable manual objects around - why should the system not drive the car quickly <br>  2 Traffic lights are needed only for people to go, and the system knows how long a sufficiently wide window in traffic will open, will show at a traffic light after how long the green man will light, check that people have time to go. <br>  3 All incomprehensible objects - a dog running out and rushing along the road, a child running out from behind the bus are tracked in advance, cars are slowed down in advance or transferred to other lanes.  In any case, the automation here can do everything no worse than a person.

      In general, complete happiness and prosperity.  In addition, you do not need any hour, you can move to this future slowly and systematically, gradually getting more and more additional advantages in the organization of movement. <br>  It‚Äôs too detailed to paint too lazy, if you're interested - let's discuss it in the comments. <br>  Maybe for starters in Skolkovo do this?  Anything better than flying vases :) </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/90727/">https://habr.com/ru/post/90727/</a></p>
