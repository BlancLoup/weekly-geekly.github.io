Previously available only to banks and large corporations the level of uninterrupted operation and the degree of reliability of storing information from InfoboxCloud <a href="http://infoboxcloud.ru/pricing/">can</a> now <a href="http://infoboxcloud.ru/pricing/">be afforded by any company</a> . <br><br> <a href="http://infoboxcloud.ru/"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/ad6/656/a6d/ad6656a6de59803657d44380caa5312f.jpg" title="InfoboxCloud Tier III" alt="InfoboxCloud Tier III"></a> <br><br>  The goal of Infobox is to make cloud hosting as secure as possible.  Therefore, for our new location, we chose the most reliable Russian data center.  At the same time, we are not going to move into the premium segment and offer our services at inflated prices.  Our partners will be able, using the advantages of the smoothly running InfoboxCloud's flexible cloud infrastructure, to create their own reliable and secure solutions, without overstating the prices for the end user.

    <h4>  Data center </h4><br>  We chose the most reliable data center for failover tests.  Our goal is not only to sell the service, but also to ensure the maximum quality and safety of its operation to solve business problems.  Placing a public cloud in a data center of this level is a precedent.  In InfoboxCloud, we have combined exceptional data center reliability, cloud server storage technology without a point of failure Parallels Cloud Storage, enterprise-level cloud management software for Parallels Automation for Cloud Infrastructure, while keeping prices affordable. <br><br>  DataSpace data processing center became the first data center in Russia and Eastern Europe, which received Tier III Design and Tier III Facility certificates from the international organization Uptime Institute.  The data center complies with international standards of reliability and fault tolerance, which guarantees the reliability and continuity of our clients' business processes. <br>  DataSpace guarantees 100% availability of equipment, applications and data, which is much higher than the Tier III Facility certification requirements (99.98% = 1.6h per year). <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/9dd/6e3/2f0/9dd6e32f02c47957584f721e376c3710.jpg" title="InfoboxCloud Tier III" alt="InfoboxCloud Tier III" width="400"><br><br>  In the Russian market of data centers, quite often there are statements of conformity of the data center to the Tier II or Tier III level that are not confirmed by certificates.  Many have certified only the documentation for the data center (Tier III Design certificate). <br><br>  <a href="http://www.dataspace.ru/">DataSpace</a> has been certified in two types: Tier III Design and Tier III Facility (checking the infrastructure of the data center).  To obtain a Tier III Facility certificate, more than 1,000 data center tests were conducted by the Uptime Institute certification organization. <br><br>  Compliance with the level of Tier III Facility guarantees the reservation of all engineering subsystems and the possibility of carrying out planned repairs and equipment replacement without stopping services.  Users of data centers of this level are large banking and financial institutions, organizations that support internal and external customers around the clock, electronic market transaction systems. <br><br><h4>  Cloud infrastructure </h4><br>  Cloud Infrastructure (IaaS) InfoboxCloud allows you to create, operate and manage reliable, resilient, secure cloud servers connected by a private network.  Cloud management is done through the control panel or through the REST API.  At any time, you can create servers of the required configuration with the possibility of autoscaling and hourly payment for the amount of allocated resources to servers without subscription fees.  For stopped servers, payment is made only for the occupied disk space, since other resources are not consumed at this time.  From the control panel, you can configure firewall rules for each machine, delegate rights to manage the cloud to administrators. <br><br>  The key difference from the Amazon Web Services, Windows Azure and Google Compute Engine services is the ability for each cloud server to set the optimal parameters for the amount of resources allocated for the task (CPU, Ram, disk, etc.) independently of each other. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/4cc/0ba/46e/4cc0ba46e7d0560c60862dc26c51a60a.jpg" title="InfoboxCloud IaaS Control Panel" alt="InfoboxCloud IaaS Control Panel" width="400"><br><br>  There is no need to choose from dozens of tariff plans and pricing tricks.  We tried to make a single and as simple as possible tariff and included 3 terabytes of traffic per month for free, so that you can roughly predict the price of the service for the month.  InfoboxCloud cloud infrastructure supports two types of virtualization: containers and isolated virtual machines (‚ÄúI will manage the OS kernel‚Äù in the InfoboxCloud control panel).  Container virtualization is faster than virtual machines, but virtual machines allow the user to make changes to the kernel of the OS if necessary. <br><br>  The installation of InfoboxCloud in the data center consists of grouping new servers combined into a fault-tolerant cluster using the PACI enterprise-level cloud solution (Parallels Automation for Cloud Infrastructure).  Cloud Infrastructure Control Panel  Now it is possible to order from it not only the cloud, but also VPS in various locations. <br><br>  The OS uses Parallels Cloud Server with activated distributed failover file system Parallels Cloud Storage for reliable storage of virtual machines.  The technology distributes data between physical servers, maximizing the throughput of the disk subsystem, performs migration and replication of servers with zero downtime and works without a point of failure.  In case of failure of a disk array or a physical server, automatic recovery of damaged, lost or inaccessible copies of data occurs without stopping the user's cloud servers.  Background verification and error correction is provided on the fly to ensure data integrity and accuracy. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/34e/8e6/7b6/34e8e67b6d279cdbb0ef6ec6e309ed8e.jpg" title="Parallels cloud storage" alt="Parallels Cloud Storage" width="600"><br><br>  More information about the software part of InfoboxCloud will be discussed in the following articles. <br><br>  Thus, cloud infrastructure virtual machines work reliably even in case of equipment failure.  The worst thing that is possible in the cloud when no more than half of the servers of the Cloud Storage cluster fails is to restart the virtual machine if the server on which the software is currently running fails.  In this case, the migration is not needed - the machine will simply start on another host from Cloud Storage with the same IP.  In the case of container virtualization, this will take a few seconds.  In the case of using hypervisor virtualization - a few minutes. <br><br>  In the coming days, a separate cluster will be put into operation, which will provide backup of machines outside of Cloud Storage.  The software platform is extremely reliable, it runs tens of thousands of automated and manual tests, but we also defend ourselves against errors in the cloud software. <br><br><h4>  Offer to partners </h4><br>  We are regularly asked about who can help with the development of sites and applications, the migration of IT infrastructure to the cloud.  We focus on providing quality service and work with partners that focus on the development, integration and end-user services of users who are not IT professionals.  Partners are provided with free resources in the cloud for experimenting and hosting their own projects.  We are waiting for you in <a href="http://infobox.ru/partners">the partnership program</a> . <br><br><h4>  trial version </h4><br>  A trial limited version for 15 days can be obtained free of charge by registering <a href="https://store.pa.infobox.ru/index.php%3Fredirect%3Dcloud_2048_trial">here</a> .  If you need to test a large project - <a href="">write about it</a> , and we will consider the possibility of providing more resources for testing. <br><br>  All reviews and questions about the use of the service can be written at: <a href="">trukhinyuri@infoboxcloud.com</a> .  We will respond to all letters in detail and take into account the wishes. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/230021/">https://habr.com/ru/post/230021/</a></p>
