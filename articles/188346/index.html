      I look at the track - I see the ‚ÄúFailed delivery attempt."  Considering the fact that I was at home on the 2nd, no one called the intercom or the telephone, it alerted me.  I called EMC - they said that according to their track, she had just left the customs at the sorting station, and I see erroneous data.  Well, I think, okay - a mistake, The main thing is not lost.  The next day I decided to go to the sorting station.  They said that the parcel left, but did not reach.  And they added - ‚ÄúWell, it‚Äôs less than two weeks, what are you worried about?  You understand everything. ‚Äù  In the end, I waited another 2 days before calling again.  In the course of the conversation the parcel was declared wanted, oh, this mail.  And only the next day, when it was almost a week, I was told that the parcel was still at customs, and with such a track (‚ÄúUnsuccessful attempt at delivery‚Äù) they were notified that it was detained.  In general, I was told that I should go to the street.  Pochtamptskaya d.9.  (central post office) in the window number 18. They work until 17-00, and not as they say in the EMC.  There we were greeted by a beautiful girl (though only on the second attempt we got there, as they said that the window should work until 17-40, we arrived at 17-02 ¬± 1 minute and it was closed there), which told us what documents we need. to collect, what statements to write and so on.  In general, she helped us a lot, for which she thanks a lot. <br>  In general, customs clearance will take 2 trips there, the first to clarify everything and take the details, and the second to complete the customs clearance.  Still experienced customs officers say that the fee can be paid through a certain IMPEX-bank, and that payments go there until three o'clock, and there they know what-where, because  Sberbank will almost certainly encounter difficulties with this (like with us, for example, we spent more than 40 minutes on making a payment, because customs do not give payments, but give a piece of paper with requisites. <br>  So, the list of documents: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/d63/b29/2cf/d63b292cf61b82cd98faefbe945a520d.jpg"><br>  1) Listing of the description of the goods - directly from ebay. <br>  2) Printout of the payment order is from the client bank, debiting for the purchase.  (you can print the PayPal transaction instead, but I didn‚Äôt risk it) <br>  3) A printout of the order confirmation is a letter that the order has been paid. <br>  4) Copy Inn <br>  5) Copy of passport <br>  6) Listing of technical specifications - technical characteristics of the device. <br>  7) Application <br>  8) Explanation (about this - below) <br>  9) Postage invoice (this is taken out of the bag, 3 such pieces of paper accompanying the parcel) <br>  10) shipping invoice <br>  11) Customs notice <br>  12) Payment order. <br><br>  Now about the worst. <br>  To import something new that does not fall into the category ‚Äúfor personal use‚Äù, you need to be a legal entity, you need to certify it, and it costs from 10k, but for B / U there are no such restrictions, so we limit ourselves to duties only. <br>  So, the explanation: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/efe/b4c/5a8/efeb4c5a8fd8e6d5cad7f56174d9bd18.jpg"><br>  The explanation is written on the basis of clause 5 of the annex to the Decision of the Board of the Eurasian Economic Commission of December 25, 2012 No. 294 ( <a href="http://www.eurasiancommission.org/ru/Lists/EECDocs/P_294.pdf">www.eurasiancommission.org/ru/Lists/EECDocs/P_294.pdf</a> ) <br><blockquote>  ... <br>  5. Submission to the customs authorities of documents certifying <br>  the conformity of products (goods) with mandatory requirements, or information about such <br>  documents not required: <br>  a) when placed under the customs procedures referred to in paragraph 4 <br>  of this Regulation, products (goods): <br>  <b>used (operation);</b> <br>  ... <br></blockquote><br>  The explanation can be printed in advance in free form, but in this case it is necessary to quote paragraph 5 of the Decision (which I did not do, and as a result I copied it by hand) <br><br>  We now turn to the statement.  Here you will be given a form. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/57e/280/97a/57e28097a13f924e18a941eb3f5e435e.jpg"><br>  It is advisable to determine <a href="http://www.tsouz.ru/db/ettr/ettwto/Pages/default.aspx">the TNVED code</a> yourself, and to indicate all the features in the column ‚ÄúName, distinguishing features, trademark, country of origin of goods‚Äù, the amount of duty will depend on this.  <b>Attention</b> : the dollar rate (and other currency) is considered at the time of application.  So pay the duties with a small margin, that if the rate suddenly changes - you still had a sufficient amount. <br><br>  Well, the duties are paid, all documents are written - approved by an excellent customs worker, and finally customs gives the go-ahead. <br>  We are given a "Customs Loan Order" and sent to the next window to pick up our package. <br><br>  Successful to you the passage of parcels! <br><br>  UPD: <br>  Dmitry contacted me, he also received an oscilloscope, but a new one, and he sent the application <a href="http://yadi.sk/d/b0Pk3sKcDHDit">forms</a> for customs. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/188346/">https://habr.com/ru/post/188346/</a></p>
