Automating the most repetitive and routine operations allows you to free up time for managers to enter into complex transactions and focus on functions that require more qualifications.

[Leads distribution among managers] <br><br>  Without proper automation, you must manually assign a specific sales person to each new lead.  If you get 100 leads every day, it means that you will perform the same task 100 times!  Suppose you spend 3-4 minutes distributing a lead, it turns out that you spend at least 350 minutes a day (about 6 hours) to process all leads. <a name="habracut"></a>  That is, at a minimum, you need to allocate 1 person to the distribution of requests from potential customers. <br><br>  Automate the process of distributing requests once and for all.  Configure the rules by which requests will be sent for qualification, then, depending on the information collected, the received request can be sent automatically to the most efficient manager, and a novice can be assigned to the lead qualification stage.  The qualification process can also be automated, for example, after receiving a request, a qualification questionnaire should be sent to the client, but the complexity of the qualification will depend on your goods and services that you sell. <br><br>  You can segment potential customers: <br><br><ul><li>  on a geographical basis; </li><li>  sales channel; </li><li>  channel of circulation; </li><li>  marketing campaign; </li><li>  customer business size; </li><li>  its industry sector; </li><li>  for the goods requested by the client, etc. </li></ul><br>  You yourself can use <a href="http://flexbby.com/ru/product/sales/">Flexbby Sales to</a> configure intelligent rules for distributing requests based on a qualification questionnaire. <br><br>  As practice shows, only 20% of clients bring 80% of money.  If the Pareto rule is applied 2 times, then 4% of customers will bring 64% of revenue.  Just think, only 4% of sales force brings more than 60% of revenue. <br><br>  2. Stop complicating, do business.  [welcome letters] <br><br>  Sending 100 letters on new leads means you need to compose these 100 letters.  But if you just need to copy and paste the same text, and only the recipient's name changes, why do the same thing 100 times?  You do not create anything new - it is simply repetition, duplication and cloning of content.  The <a href="http://flexbby.com/">Flexbby Sales</a> application frees you from this purely mechanical work.  Create letter templates to speed up the process, and you will be able to attract 100 more leads in the time available.  Create a rule according to which the system will automatically send a new letter of welcome content to a new recipient (lead).  You can also set up a chain of letters that are automatically sent by the system according to certain rules depending on the data in the qualification questionnaires.  You can define and customize these rules yourself, analyze which conversations give the best results. <br><br>  3. Understand from a half-word.  [development of relations with a new client] <br><br>  For business it is vital not to miss the new lead, to keep in touch with it.  If you are a master in lead generation, but do not process them as quickly, then you will not have sales.  When you answer to the 50th recipient in the list, it is likely that it will be too late: the vast majority prefer to contact those companies that respond to their needs faster than anyone. <br><br>  On the other hand, if you are engaged only in the development of clients and do not attract new ones, you will soon be left without clients.  So what should you do if your business grows and your resources are limited?  How can you focus on lead generation and follow up with them? <br><br>  Use the interface settings and CRM system filters to determine which transactions will be closed this month, which require a call or a response letter, which leads have not been connected for more than 30 days, etc.  Or it‚Äôs better to use the <a href="http://flexbby.com/">Flexbby Parametric</a> handlers <a href="http://flexbby.com/">settings</a> : when the system sees that most of the daily activities consist of sending email, updating data and creating tasks.  You can set up automatic generation of standard, short messages that you usually send, so you will respond to requests from customers very quickly.  You can also set up a reminder for calls and appointments during the day. <br><br>  4. More deals, less time [negotiating deal terms] <br><br>  If you do not automate the processing of requests for a discount or purchase orders, transactions may not take place, because the information does not reach your managers promptly.  There are at least three stages in processing requests: creating a task, sending it to a manager, waiting to receive approval of a transaction.  But if you need to close the deal, why do you need these actions?  You need to build into the process of your transaction the stage of approval, which will occur automatically depending on the conditions.  If conditions do not arise, then this stage will be skipped.  The <a href="http://flexbby.com/">Flexby</a> system allows you to add transaction stages dynamically depending on conditions.  For example, at some point the terms of the transaction did not require agreement, and it moved according to a specific process, then the contract value changed or the prepayment conditions significantly changed, and this already requires the approval of the higher management.  Intelligent Flexbby handlers will add or remove the coordinators, transfer the transaction to the desired stage.  The fewer manual operations, the fewer human errors, the fewer process bottlenecks and the more efficient the business.  When automating any process, always remember: 4% of effort - 64% of the result.  The task of the manager and the automation system is to learn how to allocate these 4% and not to do 96% of the work that does not bring results. <br><br>  Once, write down the rules for approving the terms of transactions in your company and automate the approval process once and for all.  But what if the superior manager is not there, or is he on vacation?  When designing our solution, we took care of it.  All <a href="http://flexbby.com/">Flexbby-</a> based <a href="http://flexbby.com/">solutions</a> allow you to customize the timing of the decision; in case of a delay, the decision can be automatically escalated to a higher-level manual or made automatically by the system.  In addition, there are rules for substitution and delegation of authority. <br><br>  Now it is not necessary for each transaction to go through a long procedure of approval, create tasks, etc. <br><br>  5. Be proactive [escalation]. <br><br>  In theory, you can wait for the client to take the initiative and continue to communicate with you.  But often the client begins to explore alternatives, appeals to competitors.  Therefore, it is important that you yourself move the negotiation process.  In order for the negotiation process to move proactively, you can set up intelligent rules by which the system itself assigns tasks to responsible managers, send letters to clients depending on the status of the transaction and / or on the category of the potential client. <br><br>  For example, during qualification, you can segment customers into categories A, B, C, D. <br><br>  For category A, set up personal contact tasks for a sales manager with a client ‚Äî those are 4% of clients who do the main business, and these transactions cannot be lost. <br><br>  For category B, set up automatic letters and a small number of tasks for personal communication with managers. <br><br>  For category C - configure only automatic letters. <br><br>  For category D, do not configure anything.  Why spend time on customers who still do not buy from you, or the cost of sales operations for which will be higher than the margins of these transactions? <br>  Such customers can simply be included in the mailing list. <br><br>  <a href="http://flexbby.com/">BE FLEXBBY!</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/337728/">https://habr.com/ru/post/337728/</a></p>
